      "byline": "Joy Francis",

      "body": "<p>In the unlikely setting of St Peter's parish centre in Farnborough, Hampshire, history was made last week when more than 200 people turned out to witness the launch of Britain's first \"Alzheimer's cafe\". On the same day, a damning report from the commission for health improvement outlined a catalogue of cruelty and degrading treatment of dementia patients at the former Garlands hospital in Cumbria. Patients had been tied to commodes, shouted at, sworn at and deprived of food. </p> <p>The coincidence of these dramatically contrasting events shows that dementia care remains shockingly inconsistent. A disease of the brain that attacks memory, speech and perception, dementia is a painful reality for 700,000 people in Britain, but is still poorly diagnosed and dealt with. </p> <p>At first glance, the concept of the Alzheimer's cafe seems remarkably simple. Once a month, people with dementia, their carers, relatives and social care professionals will meet in a cafe environment to socialise, unwind and, possibly, carry out an initial assessment leading to a much-needed service. </p> <p>Bere Miesen, the Dutch psychiatrist who pioneered the idea, says: \"The Alzheimer's cafe is an informal way to make contact with each other, to receive a consultation and feel at home. In the Netherlands, patients feel they have a place to just be. This way the patient and their family don't have to deny or avoid the illness.\" </p> <p>When Miesen launched the first cafe in Holland, in 1997, it was housed in a lecture room at Leiden University. The next month, it moved to a hotel. Finally, it arrived at its current resting place - a room in a nursing home in Warmond. </p> <p>Each month, the trailblazing cafe is attended by between 100 and 150 people, including psychotherapists, nurses, priests and social workers. With assistance from up to 10 volunteers, guests pay two guilders (about 66p) each for refreshments, listen to music and take part in discussions on the disease. </p> <p>Miesen says the cafe system is more developed in the Netherlands because of a history of robust multi-disciplinary working and more than 30 years of visible work on dementia, which affects an estimated 250,000 people in the country. There are now 10 Alzheimer's cafes in Holland and one in Belgium. </p> <p>Kandy Redwood, carers' support worker for social services in the Alton and Aldershot area, is determined to alter Miesen's perception of Britain's backwardness. As the driving force behind the new initiative, she first heard about the Dutch scheme from a neuropsychologist last June. \"I thought it would be great to pursue,\" she says. \"I asked social services to agree to the idea and they were on board from the very start, sanctioning my visit to Holland to attend a course and meet Miesen.\" </p> <p>On her return she made a number of presentations - to the local Alzheimer's Society, health and social services - and received an enthusiastic response. Professionals agreed to devote two hours of their time to the cafe every month. </p> <p>And no one complained about footing the annual cost of \u00a37,000, split between Rushmoor and Hart primary care group and Hampshire social services department. Most of the money goes towards the cost of hiring the centre, administration and paying care assistants to provide extra support. </p> <p>The scheme could not have come soon enough for the 200 carers who are supported by Redwood. More than two-thirds of them care for a relative with Alzheimer's disease. The majority are elderly themselves and feel stigmatised by the condition. In some cases, Redwood is the only person they will have seen in two months. \"It is very difficult for carers to get time for themselves, recharge their batteries or receive respite support,\" argues Redwood. \"The isolation they experience is sometimes unbearable. People in stage one dementia can drive their carer crazy as they follow them around constantly for reassurance.\" </p> <p>Joan James, 67, understands this. She tirelessly cares for her 70-year-old husband, Albert, who has Alzheimer's, and is preparing herself for the day when he no longer remembers her. </p> <p>Married for 47 years, Joan noticed that something was wrong with her husband nine years ago when they were living in Bethnal Green, east London. \"I used to give him his dinner, which he would take upstairs to eat in front of the television,\" she says. \"This time, when I gave him his dinner he turned it over without realising it.\" </p> <p>Soon after, Albert found it difficult to put on his tie or button his shirt.

      "bodyText": "In the unlikely setting of St Peter's parish centre in Farnborough, Hampshire, history was made last week when more than 200 people turned out to witness the launch of Britain's first \"Alzheimer's cafe\". On the same day, a damning report from the commission for health improvement outlined a catalogue of cruelty and degrading treatment of dementia patients at the former Garlands hospital in Cumbria. Patients had been tied to commodes, shouted at, sworn at and deprived of food. The coincidence of these dramatically contrasting events shows that dementia care remains shockingly inconsistent. A disease of the brain that attacks memory, speech and perception, dementia is a painful reality for 700,000 people in Britain, but is still poorly diagnosed and dealt with. At first glance, the concept of the Alzheimer's cafe seems remarkably simple. Once a month, people with dementia, their carers, relatives and social care professionals will meet in a cafe environment to socialise, unwind and, possibly, carry out an initial assessment leading to a much-needed service. Bere Miesen, the Dutch psychiatrist who pioneered the idea, says: \"The Alzheimer's cafe is an informal way to make contact with each other, to receive a consultation and feel at home. In the Netherlands, patients feel they have a place to just be. This way the patient and their family don't have to deny or avoid the illness.\" When Miesen launched the first cafe in Holland, in 1997, it was housed in a lecture room at Leiden University. The next month, it moved to a hotel. Finally, it arrived at its current resting place - a room in a nursing home in Warmond. Each month, the trailblazing cafe is attended by between 100 and 150 people, including psychotherapists, nurses, priests and social workers. With assistance from up to 10 volunteers, guests pay two guilders (about 66p) each for refreshments, listen to music and take part in discussions on the disease. Miesen says the cafe system is more developed in the Netherlands because of a history of robust multi-disciplinary working and more than 30 years of visible work on dementia, which affects an estimated 250,000 people in the country. There are now 10 Alzheimer's cafes in Holland and one in Belgium. Kandy Redwood, carers' support worker for social services in the Alton and Aldershot area, is determined to alter Miesen's perception of Britain's backwardness. As the driving force behind the new initiative, she first heard about the Dutch scheme from a neuropsychologist last June. \"I thought it would be great to pursue,\" she says. \"I asked social services to agree to the idea and they were on board from the very start, sanctioning my visit to Holland to attend a course and meet Miesen.\" On her return she made a number of presentations - to the local Alzheimer's Society, health and social services - and received an enthusiastic response. Professionals agreed to devote two hours of their time to the cafe every month. And no one complained about footing the annual cost of \u00a37,000, split between Rushmoor and Hart primary care group and Hampshire social services department. Most of the money goes towards the cost of hiring the centre, administration and paying care assistants to provide extra support. The scheme could not have come soon enough for the 200 carers who are supported by Redwood. More than two-thirds of them care for a relative with Alzheimer's disease. The majority are elderly themselves and feel stigmatised by the condition. In some cases, Redwood is the only person they will have seen in two months. \"It is very difficult for carers to get time for themselves, recharge their batteries or receive respite support,\" argues Redwood. \"The isolation they experience is sometimes unbearable. People in stage one dementia can drive their carer crazy as they follow them around constantly for reassurance.\" Joan James, 67, understands this. She tirelessly cares for her 70-year-old husband, Albert, who has Alzheimer's, and is preparing herself for the day when he no longer remembers her. Married for 47 years, Joan noticed that something was wrong with her husband nine years ago when they were living in Bethnal Green, east London. \"I used to give him his dinner, which he would take upstairs to eat in front of the television,\" she says. \"This time, when I gave him his dinner he turned it over without realising it.\" Soon after, Albert found it difficult to put on his tie or button his shirt. A visit to the GP gave the condition a name. But apart from a short trip to a day centre, Joan has largely cared for Albert single-handedly. When it started to get too much, the couple moved to Farnborough to be near their two sons, who help alleviate some of the burden. Now Joan's health is also under threat. She sleeps only two hours at night and describes herself as \"a bag of nerves\". Albert, who utters fully formed sentences amid indecipherable ones, says he \"doesn't like having dementia\". Joan and Albert have already experienced the benefits of attending the Alzheimer's cafe, during two test runs held earlier this year. Albert reports: \"I like it.\" His wife says: \"When I come here, I feel more relaxed. I don't have to worry about him for two hours.\" The cafe can already boast successful cases from the earlier trials. In one instance, the behaviour of an elderly man who attended a day centre run by social services was proving difficult for the staff. It was clear he needed to be assessed. He was brought to the first cafe trial by his family.

Thompson explains: \"I was able to network and, within 24 hours, we got him into a health service for an assessment. That would normally have taken us a week to do.\" In another case, a distressed woman caring for her husband was at the end of her tether, despite having day care support once a week.

With an enthusiastic endorsement from Harry Cayton, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Society, the Hampshire-based cafe is already being promoted as a beacon of good practice.

We've had several in the last few months.\" </p> <p>Nick Whyatt, head of a local, seven-partner GP practice, has a patient who's been waiting since January for a move from hospital to nursing home. Whyatt describes the knock-on effect of bed-blocking. \"Two weeks ago, a deeply unconscious old lady was found by a neighbour,\" he says. \"Normally, I'd admit her to a GP bed. Our beds were blocked; she wasn't really fit for a long ambulance journey but we had to send her 13 miles to St Martin's [Bath]. She took their last bed, so their next patient would have to go to the Royal United [also in Bath], where one of their acute medical beds would have to be used for the next elderly patient.\" </p> <p>Patient flow has been \"buggered up\" by lack of social services funding for nursing and residential homes, says Whyatt, who stresses that he sympathises with social workers' dilemma. Wiltshire social services, he asserts, has a policy of only paying for one new client when two clients come off its books. </p> <p>According to Keat's estimate, 36 out of 89 beds in Chippenham were blocked earlier this month. The position fluctuates, but she and Whyatt fear what will happen as winter takes its toll. </p> <p>A graver picture of the whole county - 119 bed-blockers in early November - comes from Dick Barton, who chairs Wiltshire Registered Care Homes.

The first reason Hallett mentions for bed-blocking is that patients, or their relatives, do not accept the first offer of a residential place if it is too far away. Funding shortages he ranks second. </p> <p>And Ray Jones, Wiltshire's director of social services, says the waiting time for such a place is \"up to about three months\".

      "body": "<p>If he were still alive, Stephen Lawrence would be 26. In the eight years since his death, the botched murder investigation by the Metropolitan police and the bungled prosecution of the white men accused of his killing have created the potential for a sea change in British race relations. </p> <p>The investigation into neglect of duty by the police led to Sir William Macpherson, who chaired the inquiry, adopting the language of Stokely Carmichael, an American black activist, in concluding that institutional racism was to blame. The report defined institutional racism as \"the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin\". </p> <p>Since then, the government has put anti-racism on the mainstream agenda. Institutions from the Royal College of Nursing to the Home Office itself have rushed to declare themselves institutionally racist. But how much has this shift in understanding affected the experience of black and Asian people? </p> <p>In the most thorough investigation of racial harassment in Britain, a survey funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has found that reporting of incidents has significantly increased since Macpherson's report. His acknowledgment that racism affects all aspects of black and Asian people's lives appears to have laid the foundations for them to come forward with more confidence that they will be taken seriously. In addition, the findings suggest, the police are more likely to record any racial motivation than they were previously. </p> <p>Despite Macpherson's assertion, the survey report, Racial Harassment: Action on the Ground, acknowledges that black and minority ethnic people are not all equally likely to be racially attacked. It cites statistics from the 1995 British crime survey, which found that 4% of black people, 5% of Indians and 8% of Pakistanis and Bangladeshis experienced one or more racist crimes, compared to 0.5% of white people. </p> <p>The Rowntree survey, conducted by researchers Lemos &amp; Crane, found that racist attacks tend to occur more frequently in crime \"hot spots\" such as particular housing estates and poorer multi-racial neighbourhoods. </p> <p>Lemos &amp; Crane interviewed more than 250 contacts in the police, local authority community safety and housing departments, housing associations, specialist and voluntary agencies in the 67 local authority areas in the UK identified by the 1991 census as having the highest numbers of black and minority ethnic residents. </p> <p>Examining levels of harassment, which range from murder in the most extreme cases to attacks on individuals and property and racist abuse, the survey found that the number of incidents reported varies hugely between areas, with 10 London boroughs, Birmingham, Leicester and Glasgow each reporting more than 1,000 separate incidents in 1999-2000. However, most agencies said under-reporting was still a problem, with incidents often not receiving the appropriate response because the racial motive was not taken into account. </p> <p>So although the message has gone out to black and ethnic minority people that they no longer have to put up with racial harassment, the survey found that the mechanisms to record, and respond to, their experiences are often far from established. </p> <p>Fewer than a third of the areas studied had a 24-hour helpline for victims and fewer than 40% provided in-depth counselling. Although more than half the areas had third-party reporting centres - including places of worship, doctors' surgeries and schools - which pass information on to relevant agencies, many staff were not trained in report taking. </p> <p>Most councils provide alarms, stronger locks, doors, fencing and improved lighting for tenants experi encing harassment, the survey suggests. But less than half the councils and housing associations had rehoused families because of racial incidents, arguing that it allowed perpetrators to drive tenants from \"white\" estates. Other councils considered the victim's security to be paramount and rehoused families if they requested it. In Ipswich, one of the areas singled out by the survey for its good practice, council tenants are rehoused at the expense of the council if they ask to be moved. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Waltham Forest, in east London, has set-up Alert, a special agency to run a 24-hour emergency line as well as compile a monitoring database, provide counselling and a specialist lawyer for victims. </p> <p>Gerard Lemos, author of the study, says that \"lack of clarity, rather than lack of commitment\" is behind much of the frustration that agencies described to researchers. He is calling for a national strategy to deal with racial harassment. </p> <p>This would include a national helpline where victims could seek immediate advice and support and then direct callers to local agencies. In addition, the researchers propose to standardise training and competence for police, landlords and other agencies dealing with victims of racial harassment. </p> <p>But Lemos &amp; Crane's most radical proposal is perhaps a national programme, possibly led by probation services, to change the offending behaviour of racist perpetrators. </p> <p>Action against perpetrators is still rare, the survey shows. Only 10-15% of reported incidents had resulted in criminal action and only a small proportion of councils had taken out injunctions or eviction orders against perpetrating tenants. </p> <p>The report cites Thames Valley police's use of restorative justice in racial harassment cases as something the rest of the country could follow. The method is most suitable for cases involving neighbours. A trained officer chairs a meeting between the perpetrator and their victim, who confronts the offender with the impact of the harassment with the intention of making him or her accountable to the victim. </p> <p>Lemos says: \"I'm not against enforcement and am not proposing this is appropriate for the most serious racially motivated crimes, but the current agenda is entirely about locking people up. We need to be thinking about positive ways to change the offending behaviour.\" </p> <p> <strong>Leeds leads the prejudice-busters</strong><br> <strong>Martin Wainwright</strong><br></p> <p>It may be muttering at work; it may be a brick through a window; it may be nastiness in the secret, don't-grass-to-teacher world of the classroom.

      "bodyText": "If he were still alive, Stephen Lawrence would be 26. In the eight years since his death, the botched murder investigation by the Metropolitan police and the bungled prosecution of the white men accused of his killing have created the potential for a sea change in British race relations. The investigation into neglect of duty by the police led to Sir William Macpherson, who chaired the inquiry, adopting the language of Stokely Carmichael, an American black activist, in concluding that institutional racism was to blame. The report defined institutional racism as \"the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin\". Since then, the government has put anti-racism on the mainstream agenda. Institutions from the Royal College of Nursing to the Home Office itself have rushed to declare themselves institutionally racist. But how much has this shift in understanding affected the experience of black and Asian people? In the most thorough investigation of racial harassment in Britain, a survey funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has found that reporting of incidents has significantly increased since Macpherson's report. His acknowledgment that racism affects all aspects of black and Asian people's lives appears to have laid the foundations for them to come forward with more confidence that they will be taken seriously. In addition, the findings suggest, the police are more likely to record any racial motivation than they were previously. Despite Macpherson's assertion, the survey report, Racial Harassment: Action on the Ground, acknowledges that black and minority ethnic people are not all equally likely to be racially attacked.

Last week's white paper on urban regeneration promises to shower councils with powers and initiatives to transform these wastelands into habitable areas. But once the glow generated by John Prescott's announcement has faded, it will be a painstaking, piecemeal business to change the gritty face of urban communities. </p> <p>Enfield, tucked under the northern rim of the M25, is a London borough that has anticipated some of deputy prime minister Prescott's proposals - and begun to act on them. Though far from the inner-city chaos of the capital, it has its problems. It has sized up one of them - the homeless - and come up with a solution that, in theory, should be a perfect fit. </p> <p>Enfield has 2,000 homeless families, the fifth highest total of any London authority. It has surveyed every bit of waste land in the area and listed about 100 sites - 40 acres in total - on which exactly 2,000 dwellings will be built in what is billed as the biggest \"infill\" housing programme in the country. </p> <p>Families already in poor council houses will be moved into these new dwellings; their homes, in turn, will be offered to those managing in temporary accommodation. It's the familiar notion of houses as hand-me-downs: the new dwellings going to those who have been council tenants longest; the oldest, which they vacate, being allocated to the late-comers. That's the way the architectural fabric of any town or city is used. </p> <p>One part of the borough, Edmonton, where many small sites have been identified for new homes, shows the mix and muddle we live with. There are terraces of small Victorian villas following the expansion of the railways; endless council estates (even though Enfield has sold 10,000 properties, it still has 13,000 to rent); and a vast, blowy shopping precinct squatting right in the middle. It is already dated - now we build malls - but it has the virtue of being central, includes a huge fruit and veg section and is a hub of activity. </p> <p>It would be foolish to suggest - and Enfield does not - that the housing problem will be eradicated by spending \u00a3150m over five years, most in grants from the housing corporation. After all, new names will be added to the homeless register; there will be difficulties with some sites; and costs will spiral. </p> <p>But that does not mean that progress cannot be made in utilising a surprising amount of sterile space. </p> <p>The first scheme involves pulling down 60 garages on an estate in Edmonton. Too many were provided for residents' needs when nearby flats were built in the 60s. The garages have long been empty and vandalised and will next year be replaced by six three-bedroom homes. </p> <p>Of the total \u00a3500,000 required to finance the project, some \u00a3295,000 will come from the housing corporation, with the Christian Action Housing Association - a partner the borough plans to involve in several other developments - raising the rest. </p> <p>Neil Aves, Enfield council's lead member for housing, says the abandoned garages head a long list of recyclable sites. \"On some estates, there are vast open tracts; windswept, barren areas which no one uses. Then there are car parks, used for dumping cars and setting fire to them; there are communal drying areas which residents don't use because their washing is stolen; and there are 'remote gardens' - too far away from flats to be used by residents.\" </p> <p>The biggest windfall is a disused access road - 350 metres (1,150ft) long and 11 metres (36ft) wide, and 32 houses will be built on it. \"We call it the micro-lite runway,\" says Steve Wright, the borough's head of housing management. </p> <p>The stockpile of sorry sites, Wright points out, has accrued from the mistakes and changes in direction of architects, planners and the commercial sector. He says: \"The vast acres of grass provided for estates in the 60s have become dangerous places, with no sense of ownership.\" Those distant gardens were a planning vogue in the 50s. At the other end of the scale, there are pram sheds and store sheds which are lying empty. </p> <p>The matter of under-used premises - shop owners who no longer need to live above their businesses - has being going on for decades, unnoticed as the shopkeepers individually prospered, but representing a considerable cache of potential flats (at least 215). They have the advantage of being situated on the long, secondary shopping streets which run through Enfield, and many are on bus routes. </p> <p>It will take at least five years for the patchwork of sites to be transformed. Aves speaks of a revolutionary initiative, which local people, the federation of Enfield's community associations and council staff are all passionate about. And with housing corporation backing, they feel they are on the right track. \"There can be nothing better than turning derelict garages into new homes,\" he says. </p> <p>They feel they are doing a lot more than just removing a few blotches on the face of the borough. Enfield may never become the most handsome of places, but it is determined to make the most of its assets.</p>",

But that does not mean that progress cannot be made in utilising a surprising amount of sterile space. The first scheme involves pulling down 60 garages on an estate in Edmonton. Too many were provided for residents' needs when nearby flats were built in the 60s. The garages have long been empty and vandalised and will next year be replaced by six three-bedroom homes. Of the total \u00a3500,000 required to finance the project, some \u00a3295,000 will come from the housing corporation, with the Christian Action Housing Association - a partner the borough plans to involve in several other developments - raising the rest. Neil Aves, Enfield council's lead member for housing, says the abandoned garages head a long list of recyclable sites. \"On some estates, there are vast open tracts; windswept, barren areas which no one uses. Then there are car parks, used for dumping cars and setting fire to them; there are communal drying areas which residents don't use because their washing is stolen; and there are 'remote gardens' - too far away from flats to be used by residents.\" The biggest windfall is a disused access road - 350 metres (1,150ft) long and 11 metres (36ft) wide, and 32 houses will be built on it. \"We call it the micro-lite runway,\" says Steve Wright, the borough's head of housing management. The stockpile of sorry sites, Wright points out, has accrued from the mistakes and changes in direction of architects, planners and the commercial sector. He says: \"The vast acres of grass provided for estates in the 60s have become dangerous places, with no sense of ownership.\" Those distant gardens were a planning vogue in the 50s. At the other end of the scale, there are pram sheds and store sheds which are lying empty. The matter of under-used premises - shop owners who no longer need to live above their businesses - has being going on for decades, unnoticed as the shopkeepers individually prospered, but representing a considerable cache of potential flats (at least 215). They have the advantage of being situated on the long, secondary shopping streets which run through Enfield, and many are on bus routes. It will take at least five years for the patchwork of sites to be transformed. Aves speaks of a revolutionary initiative, which local people, the federation of Enfield's community associations and council staff are all passionate about. And with housing corporation backing, they feel they are on the right track. \"There can be nothing better than turning derelict garages into new homes,\" he says. They feel they are doing a lot more than just removing a few blotches on the face of the borough. Enfield may never become the most handsome of places, but it is determined to make the most of its assets.",

      "bodyText": "With its first millionaire winner, where does ITV's Who Wants to be a Millionaire? go now? Its horoscope (first broadcast 8pm, September 4 1998) shows a quizzical, encyclopaedic Virgo with a mass appeal that comes from generous Jupiter rising in sympathetic Pisces. This is a classic good-luck placing, reflecting the dream prizes that are worth playing for and the show's ethos of a benevolent universe in which no one is a loser and no one looks a complete idiot. Judith Keppel's million-pound win on November 20 times to Saturn's transit by square of the horoscope's Venus in regal Leo, a classy, well-connected lady, but there is a darker symbolic undercurrent at work. ITV bosses are said to be furious at accusations that the questions were slanted to allow the show to deliver a knock-out blow against the much-trailed final episode of BBC1's One Foot in the Grave, and it's not surprising to find such suggestions, given the movement of shady Pluto square to the show's Sun last week. Pluto is lord of the underworld, ruler of the dead, signifier of the unconscious and the hidden, and the striking Sun-Pluto symbolism now is an Ariadne thread, drawing together apparently unrelated elements. What does it reveal? The show was recorded the night before, on SUNday, and the story leaked to the Sun. This ensured maximum impact for its 9pm slot against One Foot in the Grave (Pluto), showing Victor Meldrew's demise (Pluto). Now look at the million-pound question: \"Which king was married to Eleanor of Aquitaine?\" As an earl's grand-daughter herself and a relative of Camilla Parker Bowles, it was somewhat fortuitous that Judith Keppel should be asked a question about the consort of an English king (Sun). Ms Keppel revealed that, by chance, she had visited Eleanor's tomb (Pluto) this summer, so the image of the grave lay at the heart of the final question. It is also the million-pound moment which the show's presenter, Chris Tarrant, has been waiting for. With all the charm of a benign, attentive Libran, Tarrant was born on a Full Moon in pioneering Aries, with a dose of ironic Scorpio and pukka Saturnian timing (7.20pm, October 10 1946, Reading). His horoscope shows that this is the benchmark moment he needs to allow him to move on, and it looks as if his time on the programme is up. Whatever millions ITV might offer to keep him, Neptune crossing his career point at the start of next year heralds a longing to escape, and by March, if contracts allow, his impatient and adventurous Aries will be urging him to move on. The show could then enter a Plutonic half-life, a karmic kick-back for seeing off One Foot in the Grave. Email the Media Medium at maggie@companyguide.co.uk",

They have clearly grasped the wrong end of the stick. The pre-amble of the protocol accurately reflects the approach already adopted by the Strasbourg court. Indeed the explanatory report accompanying the protocol makes it clear that it was not considered necessary to include a restriction clause since not every difference of treatment amounts to discrimination: it would only be discriminatory if it \"has no objective and reasonable justification\". The protocol would not prevent a government from taking positive measures to reduce inequality. </p> <p>Perhaps an underlying fear of the government is that an equality provision will draw the judges into examining social issues, perhaps with cash implications. Yet the judiciary already deal with highly sensitive and complex issues of social policy and frequently exercises restraint and the structure of the Human Rights Act ensures that the judges could not strike down any acts of parliament.

Chief Executive, Oxford Radcliffe Hospital NHS Trust - 1993 to 1997 I was the first Chief Executive of the major teaching hospital in Oxford, one of the leading academic medical centres in the country, which is linked to Oxford University and serves the specialist needs of 2m people. It has 5,000 staff and a budget, at today's values, of more than \u00a3220m. In this post I : \u0095 successfully managed major organisational and cultural change, merging teaching hospitals and leading the resulting organisation into becoming a semi-autonomous NHS Trust able to operate effectively within the NHS internal market \u0095 developed the range and quality of services in the hospital and took a personal lead in promoting radical change in some services eg, the development of a ground breaking trauma service and the creation of a new breast service \u0095 dealt with very difficult operational, personnel and financial issues in order to ensure that targets were hit and firm foundations were laid for future development General Manager, later Chief Executive of Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Trust - 1988 to 1993 I ran this busy district general hospital which serves Slough, Maidenhead, Windsor and Ascot for 5 years leading it through a merger and the process of becoming an NHS Trust. During this period the Trust developed new services and established a viable position in the new NHS internal market. General Manager, East Berkshire Mental Handicap Unit - 1986 to 1988 I joined the NHS in 1986 at a time when general management was being introduced and ran this unit in Bracknell for 2 years. Director, Cambridgeshire Community Council - 1981 to 1986 I worked in Cambridgeshire for a charity involved in the development of the voluntary sector, the promotion of rural communities and rural life and the delivery of services in association with public authorities. Production Manager, Trebor plc - 1978 to 1981 In 1978 I became a Production Manager in a new factory in Colchester which was designed to break up traditional production lines with the introduction of semi-autonomous working groups. I was responsible for running the first production unit and setting in place the new systems. The factory was successful in achieving production targets and an evaluation by Sheffield University demonstrated improvements in job satisfaction, recruitment and retention of staff. Community Development Officer, Halewood Community Council - 1973 to 1978 I worked for 5 years for this local charity engaged in community development in Liverpool. I evaluated the success of the project whilst registered within the Department of Social Administration at Lancaster University. \u0095 This CV is reproduced with the original spelling and punctuation, courtesy of the Department of Health.",

Mr Pluthero said talks were going well but wouldn't give details of who it was or how long they would take to reach a conclusion. \"I can't say anything more than the statement we put out this morning as we're in an offer period,\" said Mr Pluthero. A deal with Wanadoo, which was launched in 1996 and runs the Voila portal, would lead to a closer working relationship between Freeserve and Britain's largest cable TV group, NTL, which is partly owned by France Telecom. The two were linked together in the summer but no deal materialised. Shares in Freeserve have fallen back to around 140p after climbing to more to than 155p in early trading this morning.",

They saw secretly recorded video footage of a 71-year-old man talking about having oral sex with a young member of his family. He admitted to BBC cameras that he started having sex with one stepdaughter when she was 10. One adult stepdaughter - who videoed him secretly for Newsnight, having spent years trying to persuade the authorities to listen to her claims - told how he had sold his stepchildren to other men for sex. Another stepdaughter said she thought he would abuse again.</p> <p>The first response of those professionals who saw the programme was that it was shocking. \"It was shocking to hear [the abusers] talking about children as promiscuous. It showed how difficult it was for children to come forward, when the abuser was their father or someone they see as their father,\" said NCH Action for Children senior public policy officer Annie Mullins. Even for hardened professionals, it was hard to watch, she says.</p> <p>But Mullins' view, and that of other professionals in the field, is that it was a responsible and important attempt to raise the issue of long-term child abuse within the family. \"It was immensely valuable, in that it revealed, in a very powerful way, that these people are affable - people trust them. He seemed like a loving grandad [to his toddler stepgrandson] but you wondered if it was a form of grooming,\" she says. \"It showed the clear dichotomy of [one abused relative] who wanted to bring him to justice and [another] who loved him and wanted to protect him. It showed the way victims react in different ways and take the blame, feel shame.\"</p> <p>The programme has led to the arrest of two elderly men by Merseyside police. (The police, along with social services, came in for implicit criticism in the programme for their seeming inaction over many years.) And it probably has the latest claim to water-cooler television status. Only, unlike other talk-provoking programmes, such as Big Brother or Ally McBeal, this one was real life. But, points out Childline chief executive Valerie Howarth: \"The problem with child abuse is people don't want to sustain a debate. The general public has 48 hours of shock horror and then want to forget.\" </p> <p>How long the discussions will last depends, in part, on the public's willingness to face what is a terrible and almost unbelievable truth - that most sexually abused children (89%) are not victims of the unknown paedophile, lurking in a park wearing a dirty mac. They are buggered and raped and assaulted by friends and relatives.</p> <p>It was a point made explicit in the programme and welcomed by Tink Palmer, Barnardo's development officer. \"A lot of people still believe that 'stranger danger' is the problem,\" she says. \"The one message is that it happens on people's doorsteps and within their homes and within their families more than anywhere else.\"</p> <p>Mullins is hopeful that this could be the start of a public debate on familial abuse. \"I listened to people on the train the next day and they were shocked that someone could wield that power in a family.\"</p> <p>Tackling the power of an abuser is key. Moira Gibb, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, sums it up as: \"How do you make children able to tell their stories if the most important person in their life is abusing them? Children are often frightened to tell because they think that their family will be broken up.\" But she says that professionals are learning \"the way in which abusers operate and developing practice in the light of that.\"</p> <p>Good inter-agency working is vital to create a safety net for children. \"There need to be strong local networks, which can create relationships of trust between schools, police and social services, that can consistently reach out to very vulnerable children,\" she says. \"And these kind of cases require consistent attention.\"</p> <p>But, for children to be safe, local communities need to be alert to danger signals - and prepared to act on them. \"We've got to have a public education campaign,\" says Palmer. Non-abusing carers, friends and neighbours need to understand how paedophiles \"groom\" children and gain their trust. They need to be made aware of how \"gradual, abusive attitudes\" develop.</p> <p>The Home Office has recently announced \u00a350,000 in funding for a public awareness campaign, Stop It Now UK and Ireland, run by the Faithfull Foundation and the National Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers. From the evidence shown on British television screens, it would seem there's a long way to go before children can speak out about abuse and be heard by our society.</p>",

In total, the agencies received almost 42,000 reports of racial harassment between April 1999 and March this year, compared with 23,000 racial incidents recorded by all British police forces in the previous year. A spokeswoman for the commission for racial equality said: \"The increase in reported incidents can be attributed to the fact that we now have the statistics - now the problem is fully recognised individuals may feel more confident in reporting harassment.\" The survey, which also examined the support available for racial harassment victims, found that almost 80% of the boroughs had forums - typically in surgeries, schools, churches and advice centres - to tackle the problem. But less than a third of the areas had a 24-hour helpline and few offered counselling. Most councils provided extra security for worried tenants. The survey found that less than half of the councils and housing associations had rehoused families after racial incidents, arguing that this move let perpetrators drive tenants from \"white\" estates. The survey also looked at what action had been taken against perpetrators. Possession proceedings had been taken by more than half the boroughs surveyed, but anti-social behaviour orders were used to deal with racially motivated harassment in only three areas.",

      "body": "<p>Under-reporting of racial harassment is widespread despite the number of recorded incidents soaring since the inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, according to a survey released today. </p> <p>Almost all the organisations questioned in the study, which examines levels of harassment reported to police, councils, housing associations and community groups, said the number of black and ethnic minority people reporting harassment had risen since the 1999 Macpherson report on the Metropolitan Police's handling of the Lawrence case. </p> <p>Imran Khan, solicitor for the Lawrence family, said the Macpherson report had emboldened more to come forward and \"engendered a huge expectation\" that the police would respond. But he added: \"The police have taken much of the credit for increased reporting, claiming that they have won trust, but that is not reflected by the number of clients who come to me disgruntled with the police response and the number of complaints, on grounds of race, against police officers.\" </p> <p>However, the survey found that most agencies considered under-reporting and under-recording of harassment still a big problem, with asylum seekers identified by several respondents as the group least likely to report harassment. </p> <p>The research, by Lemos and Crane for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, focused on the 67 local authority areas with the highest concentration of ethnic minorities. More than 1,000 incidents were reported in 10 London boroughs, Birmingham, Leicester, and Glasgow, from 1999 to 2000. Newham, in east London, received more than 2,000 reports, the highest number in the country.

      "bodyText": "Under-reporting of racial harassment is widespread despite the number of recorded incidents soaring since the inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, according to a survey released today. Almost all the organisations questioned in the study, which examines levels of harassment reported to police, councils, housing associations and community groups, said the number of black and ethnic minority people reporting harassment had risen since the 1999 Macpherson report on the Metropolitan Police's handling of the Lawrence case. Imran Khan, solicitor for the Lawrence family, said the Macpherson report had emboldened more to come forward and \"engendered a huge expectation\" that the police would respond. But he added: \"The police have taken much of the credit for increased reporting, claiming that they have won trust, but that is not reflected by the number of clients who come to me disgruntled with the police response and the number of complaints, on grounds of race, against police officers.\" However, the survey found that most agencies considered under-reporting and under-recording of harassment still a big problem, with asylum seekers identified by several respondents as the group least likely to report harassment. The research, by Lemos and Crane for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, focused on the 67 local authority areas with the highest concentration of ethnic minorities. More than 1,000 incidents were reported in 10 London boroughs, Birmingham, Leicester, and Glasgow, from 1999 to 2000. Newham, in east London, received more than 2,000 reports, the highest number in the country. Eight boroughs, mostly in rural areas, recorded fewer than 100 incidents of racial harassment in the past year. In total, the agencies received almost 42,000 reports of racial harassment between April 1999 and March this year, compared with 23,000 racial incidents recorded by all British police forces in the previous year. A spokeswoman for the commission for racial equality said: \"The increase in reported incidents can be attributed to the fact that we now have the statistics - now the problem is fully recognised individuals may feel more confident in reporting harassment.\" The survey, which also examined the support available for racial harassment victims, found that almost 80% of the boroughs had forums - typically in surgeries, schools, churches and advice centres - to tackle the problem. But less than a third of the areas had a 24-hour helpline and few offered counselling. Most councils provided extra security for worried tenants.

It was not so much their prudence that irritated me as their bloody smugness.

With roughly 15 years of college fees to think about, no timeshare winters in Tenerife for us, thank goodness! </p> <p>Not that our late baby was entirely a product of sage forward planning. Nor was it intentionally a homage to our glorious leader (I am 50 and my wife Janet is 43, so by coincidence our family fits the Tony-Cherie mould almost exactly). It was more a case of what the Americans, I believe, call \"slipping one past the goalie\". </p> <p>However, had we both realised what a joy a baby was going to be at this stage in our lives, we would have planned it. When you are younger, you tend to get caught up in the negative aspects of the new arrival: the sleepless nights, the restrictions on your social life, the endless nappies full of what Robin Williams called \"part Velcro, part toxic waste\". But when you have been through the process three times and emerged relatively unscathed, you tend to take a more relaxed view. </p> <p>For you, David, I gather it is the first time, so you will never have had to deal with the mewling and puking, but you have worked in television, and I imagine that is much the same. For us, it is almost certainly the last time (we have signed a new goalie), and that helps concentrate the mind wonderfully on the glorious adventure of child-rearing - although rearing may be a slightly optimistic term for what has been going on between us and our children. </p> <p>I am not sure what the recommended number of servings per day of fruit and vegetables is, but in 16 years I don't think we have hit the mark once, unless \"large fries\" counts as a vegetable.

Do little tiny shoes still cost twice as much as real ones? </p> <p>I don't suppose the shoe issue will be a big one for you, David, but it is what lies behind my modest offer of advice. Sure, I feel guilty about treating the new baby as a freelance opportunity, but I explained the financial imperative to Ruth, and she dribbled some milk out of the corner of her mouth, which I took as assent. </p> <p>See David, talk to them.

Sure, I feel guilty about treating the new baby as a freelance opportunity, but I explained the financial imperative to Ruth, and she dribbled some milk out of the corner of her mouth, which I took as assent. See David, talk to them. It works. Read to them, too. And relax.",

The BBC apologised after a Candid Camera-style prank used a child actor as a \"homeless\" African child who was left on the doorstep of a Hertfordshire child minder. Gillian Dumbarton, 49, answered the door to a man claiming he was collecting money for African children. When she donated a pound, a wooden box was unloaded and the child ran towards her. Outraged by the stunt's poor taste and the inappropriate use of the child, Mrs Dumbarton called the police to have the TV crew removed. </p> <p>Child actors are back in the news following the phenomenal success of Billy Elliot, the forthcoming Harry Potter film and Macaulay Culkin's London stage debut. Culkin's transition from child to adult actor comes as a surprise after a trail of film flops in the late 1990s, a custody battle between his parents and his own public bitterness towards his father and manager, Kit. Culkin became the highest-paid child actor ever for the Home Alone films, but Kit was once dubbed \"the stage father from hell\". Himself a former child actor, Kit was held responsible for his son's plummeting career in 1996 after demanding huge fees for his son and a laundry list of conditions on film projects. </p> <p>Culkin might be considered fortunate to have survived. The horror stories of young actors whose childhoods end in parental estrangement, drug addiction or suicide are enough to terrify any sensible parent into giving stage and screen a wide berth. </p> <p>On the other hand, working in film or theatre can offer a child undreamed-of opportunities that it would seem churlish to turn down. Nicky Egerton's 11-year-old daughter, Tamsin Egerton Dick, is one of two child actors playing the lead role of Mary in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of The Secret Garden. Egerton, who acts as Tamsin's chaperone, says that in the past year her daughter has gone from playing parts in a local youth theatre in Petersfield to completing her first film. The Mists of Avalon, which appears on American television in June, was shot in Prague, where Tamsin played opposite Anjelica Huston and Julianna Margulies. There were plenty of thrills during filming: limos to and from the luxury hotel, meeting famous film stars, and a fantastic costume. </p> <p>\"She particularly liked Anjelica Huston,\" says Egerton. \"They'd sit and have a little tete-\u00e0-tete. She enjoyed every minute.\" </p> <p>Egerton is adamant that Tamsin is acting only because she wants to; her parents see their role as helping her to achieve her goals. She says her daughter showed an interest in the stage from the age of three, when she volunteered to sing at the local panto: \"She sang her little song and it didn't make her nervous, she enjoyed it.\" By the age of eight, she was performing with a local youth theatre when her name was put forward for a part in a children's television series. When she lost that role to a girl with more experience and an agent, Tamsin signed on with Sylvia Young. </p> <p>Theatre work, says Egerton, is much more intensive than film. For The Secret Garden, there are daily rehearsals and three hours of schoolwork with an RSC tutor. If the run goes well, there is the possibility of a transfer to the West End - and other film work may come up, as feedback from Tamsin's American director has been positive. </p> <p>But the experience is not always so rosy. Kate Evans, a casting director who auditions children for film, commercial and modelling jobs at Kate and Allie Casting, attests to the industry's more ruthless aspect. \"Children are rejected all the time for parts,\" she remarks, \"and I can't imagine what that does to them.\" </p> <p>For parents, however, there is the very adult fear that if they turn down a job for their child, the next one will never come along. \"What you worry about is that she'll have this intense period and then it all goes quiet,\" says Egerton. \"Will she feel disappointed? What you don't want is for your child, aged 11, to feel washed out and empty.\" </p> <p>According to Evans, it is worse when a child is wheedled into performing because they are living out the parents' unfulfilled ambitions. \"I've seen bribery, all sorts of things go on to get a child to perform,\" she says. </p> <p>The scenario where a child is cajoled into cooperating by a frantic parent with the promise of a Happy Meal afterwards is wearyingly familiar. \"The better parents are the ones who are more relaxed, and that shows in the child's personality,\" Evans observes. </p> <p>But the demands of managing a child actor's career can take its toll on family life. While Nicky Egerton was away with Tamsin for eight months, her 17-year-old daughter went through her A levels and fell in love for the first time. \"She needed guidance and her mother was on the end of a telephone,\" says Egerton. \"Inevitably, the rest of the family suffers.\" </p> <p>Having a child doing the round of auditions is a major commitment: Evans says some will have four castings at various London locations in a single afternoon.

If she had other children, she says, it would be impossible, even though casting directors try to arrange schedules around school hours and holidays.

      "body": "<p>It sounds easy. If you end up with triplets through IVF, you can simply \"reduce\" the number of embryos to two. That was what a Sheffield fertility centre would have told its patient Patricia Thompson. She and husband Peter opted to implant only two embryos but, contrary to their wishes, the clinic put back three. As a result, she became pregnant with triplets. Having decided against any \"embryo reduction\", the couple made headlines last week when they successfully sued the clinic for - they hope - the \u00a3100,000 cost of bringing up the third child. My partner and I received the same advice about embryo reduction when pursuing similar treatment. But after we discovered that we were expecting triplets, life became such a harrowing succession of conflicting emotions, lack of information and a shrinking time frame, that making a rational decision became near impossible. </p> <p>When we went for IVF, we had not contemplated the idea of triplets. One baby would do nicely, or maybe twins, we'd thought - probably much like the Thompsons. The fertility specialist advised us to have three eggs put back, to increase the chances of one taking (good for us, good for the clinic's success rating). It was unlikely all three would implant, we were told: only 1.6% of its pregnancies led to triplets. And if they did all take, we could reduce the number of embryos to increase the chances of taking home a baby. Simple. </p> <p>So three eggs were put back. But if there is a percentage, someone has to be it: the scan at week eight showed it was us. Diane was incubating a trio of healthy egg sacs. Our joy imploded as the magnitude of our dilemma dawned on us. We had to decide whether to kill off one embryo to give the other two a better chance. Or not. </p> <p>The argument for reducing is strong. Twins on the whole stand as much chance of having a birth defect or genetic abnormality as an average singleton baby. But triplets fare worse. They are always born prematurely (before 36 weeks' gestation), and only half reach the \"safe\" point of 29 weeks, when they are on a parity with singletons. Those born before significantly risk a disability ranging from dyslexia through cerebral palsy to a vegetative state. Or they may die. </p> <p>Carrying three foetuses also increases the risk of miscarriage. But the reduction procedure itself - inserting a needle into the embryo's heart to stop it beating - may also induce miscarriage of the other foetuses. </p> <p>We knew that any embryo showing a genetic abnormality would be selected for termination. The problem was that the usual blood and sampling tests would prove ineffective with so many babies. We had to wait in limbo until the ultrasound scan could pick up enough detail to show any defect. In week 12, all were healthy. One boy, one girl, one wouldn't open its legs. We mentioned reduction. The first available appointment with the consultant was in two weeks. </p> <p>A fortnight later our consultant - a specialist in multiple births - said he would have no qualms about reducing our embryo count. Medically, it made sense to cut the chances of premature birth. He added that, if we kept all three, it was likely that they would be shipped to other hospitals for care during their first few weeks of life. NHS neonatal cots were funded, he said, on the natural rate of triplets, but IVF has nearly trebled that rate. The upshot is that the NHS has to fly vulnerable newborns to wherever incubators are available. Aberdeen was mentioned. We live in London. So he'd happily take away the easiest embryo to get at. To lessen the chance of miscarriage, he needed the decision by Friday. This was Tuesday. </p> <p>We went home and wept. We talked over the arguments. All the embryos were fine. Could we live with ourselves if we killed off one for the sake of the others? How could we face the resultant twins knowing there could have been another? And how would we feel if the reduction procedure caused a miscarriage and we lost them all - after all the years of trying? </p> <p>Then again, if we kept all three, they might miscarry naturally. Or come too early, with all the related risks. We knew triplets would be hard work, but could we cope if one was disabled? What was the chance of catastrophic brain damage rather than a learning disability? The obstetricians and multiple-birth groups did not know the answer: all the disabilities, from dyslexia to severe brain damage, were lumped together in one statistic. </p> <p>On the Wednesday, I made a desperate call to the one hospital department I thought could help, but which no one had mentioned. I telephoned the neonatal unit and begged information. No one could come to the phone. By a stroke of luck, a wonderful nurse saw my message, pulled our file from the twins clinic, then set up a meeting first thing on Thursday with a senior nurse and the professor who headed the unit. They talked us through the risks and rates of disabilities and their treatability, then showed us around the unit full of red and ratty-looking premature babies. We searched our hearts. We went upstairs and told the obstetrician to keep his needle in the drawer. </p> <p>Then life got really tough. Diane went into a catastrophically premature labour. Our hospital's neonatal unit was full so she was sent to the nearest with three incubators - fortunately, still in London. There they stopped the labour and, after a two-month stay on the ward, my partner gave birth by emergency caesarean to three beautiful, healthy babies, then eight weeks premature. After five weeks in neonatal they came home at the beginning of March this year. </p> <p> And then, as the Thompsons have attested, the real work began. Being home alone with three babies is an exhausting version of plate-spinning - you just finish with the third and the first needs attention again - with possets on. </p> <p>When they first came home, they were feeding every three hours. As it took up to 40 minutes to change, feed and wind each one, that left one hour in every cycle to wash 18-plus bottles a day, make up formula milk, bathe, cuddle and entertain them, then feed yourself and do household chores. We ended up sleeping in shifts (five hours each) and became adept at bottle-feeding while still technically asleep. </p> <p>There was still the problem of not having enough arms. With twins, you can bottle-feed and cuddle both simultaneously. But with three, you must either balance bottles on blankets for two in the cot while holding and feeding the third, or let one scream. </p> <p>As they grew, the trick was to feed a pair at a time propped up in my crossed legs. But they have become too large for that since I took over as the full-time parent (after six months my partner went back to work for a rest), so now they take main meals in their high chairs as I move down the line spooning in the food. </p> <p>Now if they all kick off at once, I employ a sort of triage system - listening to their cries to determine who's hungry, wet, lying on a sharp toy, or just crying in sympathy, then first going to the one that can be helped quickest (hunger takes longest). Mistakes can lead to eardrum-bursting screaming for the best part of an hour. </p> <p>In my first weeks as primary carer, entertainment involved swapping them between door bouncer, swinging seat and my arms. Three months on, it entails me lying on the floor while they crawl on my head. When I do manage to stand up, I've always got one in my arms (hence the wrist supports, weightlifter's belt and the feeling that I get an inch shorter each day). So I end up passing toys with my toes, and helping the one stuck on something hard with my foot. </p> <p>If the others want attention while I'm holding one, I'll often end up losing my trousers - they will crawl up my legs to get a cuddle, dragging down my milk-and-puke-stained comfy trews as they go. </p> <p>We become a spectator sport for the general public when we go out, especially if they're in the quad buggy. The plus side is the adulation they receive; the down side is the dumb questions. </p> <p>\"Are they quads?\" No, that's their nappy bag. </p> <p>\"Are they triplets?\" Yes. \"Are they all yours?\" </p> <p>\"What have you got?\" A girl and two boys. \"Are they identical?\" </p> <p>Someone once asked what our quad buggy was for. It's a taxi service for babies, said my partner. \"What a good idea!\" Most passers-by tend to blurt out an involuntary \"Oh my God!\" when they catch sight of the buggyful, while the standard I-wish-I-had-a-pound-for-every-time-I've-heard-that comment is: \"Bet you've got your hands full.\" You don't say. </p> <p>Despite all the stress, as Thompson said, having triplets is a delight - when they make each other laugh or chase a bottle around the floor together. And having three beaming smiles greet you in the morning is priceless.</p>",

The obstetricians and multiple-birth groups did not know the answer: all the disabilities, from dyslexia to severe brain damage, were lumped together in one statistic. On the Wednesday, I made a desperate call to the one hospital department I thought could help, but which no one had mentioned. I telephoned the neonatal unit and begged information. No one could come to the phone. By a stroke of luck, a wonderful nurse saw my message, pulled our file from the twins clinic, then set up a meeting first thing on Thursday with a senior nurse and the professor who headed the unit. They talked us through the risks and rates of disabilities and their treatability, then showed us around the unit full of red and ratty-looking premature babies. We searched our hearts. We went upstairs and told the obstetrician to keep his needle in the drawer. Then life got really tough. Diane went into a catastrophically premature labour. Our hospital's neonatal unit was full so she was sent to the nearest with three incubators - fortunately, still in London. There they stopped the labour and, after a two-month stay on the ward, my partner gave birth by emergency caesarean to three beautiful, healthy babies, then eight weeks premature. After five weeks in neonatal they came home at the beginning of March this year. And then, as the Thompsons have attested, the real work began. Being home alone with three babies is an exhausting version of plate-spinning - you just finish with the third and the first needs attention again - with possets on. When they first came home, they were feeding every three hours. As it took up to 40 minutes to change, feed and wind each one, that left one hour in every cycle to wash 18-plus bottles a day, make up formula milk, bathe, cuddle and entertain them, then feed yourself and do household chores. We ended up sleeping in shifts (five hours each) and became adept at bottle-feeding while still technically asleep. There was still the problem of not having enough arms. With twins, you can bottle-feed and cuddle both simultaneously. But with three, you must either balance bottles on blankets for two in the cot while holding and feeding the third, or let one scream. As they grew, the trick was to feed a pair at a time propped up in my crossed legs. But they have become too large for that since I took over as the full-time parent (after six months my partner went back to work for a rest), so now they take main meals in their high chairs as I move down the line spooning in the food. Now if they all kick off at once, I employ a sort of triage system - listening to their cries to determine who's hungry, wet, lying on a sharp toy, or just crying in sympathy, then first going to the one that can be helped quickest (hunger takes longest). Mistakes can lead to eardrum-bursting screaming for the best part of an hour. In my first weeks as primary carer, entertainment involved swapping them between door bouncer, swinging seat and my arms. Three months on, it entails me lying on the floor while they crawl on my head. When I do manage to stand up, I've always got one in my arms (hence the wrist supports, weightlifter's belt and the feeling that I get an inch shorter each day). So I end up passing toys with my toes, and helping the one stuck on something hard with my foot. If the others want attention while I'm holding one, I'll often end up losing my trousers - they will crawl up my legs to get a cuddle, dragging down my milk-and-puke-stained comfy trews as they go. We become a spectator sport for the general public when we go out, especially if they're in the quad buggy. The plus side is the adulation they receive; the down side is the dumb questions. \"Are they quads?\" No, that's their nappy bag. \"Are they triplets?\" Yes. \"Are they all yours?\" \"What have you got?\" A girl and two boys. \"Are they identical?\" Someone once asked what our quad buggy was for. It's a taxi service for babies, said my partner. \"What a good idea!\" Most passers-by tend to blurt out an involuntary \"Oh my God!\" when they catch sight of the buggyful, while the standard I-wish-I-had-a-pound-for-every-time-I've-heard-that comment is: \"Bet you've got your hands full.\" You don't say. Despite all the stress, as Thompson said, having triplets is a delight - when they make each other laugh or chase a bottle around the floor together. And having three beaming smiles greet you in the morning is priceless.",

Occasionally, when he was especially careless, I would be thrown into a concussion. If my mother cried or tried to stop our stepfather from hurting us, he would turn on her. We regularly saw our mother being throttled, punched in the face, hurled against the wall or the floor and threatened with boiling water and knives. </p> <p>After each explosion, my stepfather would thrust his hand over my face until I gagged. He whispered foul, graphic threats to let me know just what he would do if ever I, the eldest child, opened my mouth to tell. He made me terrified of confiding in my own mother about his private assaults on me.

Today we have to deal with those problems that we inherited from that time - the boom and bust economics, the social division, the chronic under-investment in our public services. \"A sensible, modern attitude to Europe is what we need.\"</p> <p>Baroness Thatcher, interviewed last night on the eve of the 10th anniversary of her departure from Downing Street, described the new European defence force as \"monumental folly\".</p> <p>Lady Thatcher told the Sun: \"The government's plans to create a new European army make no military sense at all. None to Britain, whose forces are already over stretched. None to Europe, which has even less chance of becoming a military power than of creating a sound currency.</p> <p>\"And none to Nato, which this proposal threatens to divide and destroy.It is a piece of monumental folly that puts our security at risk in order to satisfy political vanity.\"</p> <p>Lady Thatcher's intervention in the political row over the new force came after the Tory leader, William Hague, said the party would seek to turn it into a general election issue, and committed a future Conservative government to pulling British troops out of the new structure.</p> <p>Mr Hague insisted: \"It is not too late for Mr Blair to change course and say we are going to bring this all back within Nato to meet all these concerns ... This will be a general election issue.\"</p> <p>Lord Tebbit, formerly one of Lady Thatcher's closest allies, said today that mutual respect between her and Mr Blair had evaporated \"a long time ago\".</p> <p>\"She did not take that long to discover that what he was saying about his Eurosceptic and Thatcherite credentials was purely for electoral purposes,\" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One.</p> <p>\"I think he wanted to ride on her coat tails for as long as he could so perhaps it is only recently that he has felt bold enough to decide to desert that position.\"</p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/thatcher/\">The Thatcher era</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Tories/\">The Tories in opposition</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Thatcher/Story_Three_Col/0,2763,206027,00.html\">20 April 1999: No giant is greater than Thatcher - Hague</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Thatcher/Story/0,2763,401093,00.html\">22 November 2000: Ups and downs of Iron Lady's favourites</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Thatcher/Story/0,2763,206013,00.html\">3 May 1999: She changed Britain and created Blair</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/eu/graphic/0,7367,400792,00.html\">21 November 2000: Steve Bell on the Euro army</a></p> <p><b>Talk</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7b662/61\">Where were you when Thatcher resigned?\"</a></p> <p><b>Useful sites</b><br><a href=\"http://www.the-sun.co.uk/news/13183181\" target=\"_new\">22 November: Maggie handbags Blair - the Sun</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.mod.uk/index.php3?page=882\" target=\"_new\"> Background: rapid reaction forces - Ministry of Defence</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair today launched an all-out counter-attack against Baroness Thatcher after she hit out at his plans for Britain to sign up to a European rapid reaction force. The prime minister used a Downing Street press conference to denounce what he said was Lady Thatcher's legacy of \"boom and bust\" economics, social division and chronic under-investment in public services. Her policies on Europe had been wrong for Britain and that it was now time for the country to move forward into a new era, he said. \"I take nothing away from those things that were done in the 1980s that we have kept, but it really is time in my view that we move British politics beyond the time of Margaret Thatcher,\" Mr Blair went on. \"We are in a new era. Today we have to deal with those problems that we inherited from that time - the boom and bust economics, the social division, the chronic under-investment in our public services. \"A sensible, modern attitude to Europe is what we need.\" Baroness Thatcher, interviewed last night on the eve of the 10th anniversary of her departure from Downing Street, described the new European defence force as \"monumental folly\". Lady Thatcher told the Sun: \"The government's plans to create a new European army make no military sense at all. None to Britain, whose forces are already over stretched. None to Europe, which has even less chance of becoming a military power than of creating a sound currency. \"And none to Nato, which this proposal threatens to divide and destroy.It is a piece of monumental folly that puts our security at risk in order to satisfy political vanity.\" Lady Thatcher's intervention in the political row over the new force came after the Tory leader, William Hague, said the party would seek to turn it into a general election issue, and committed a future Conservative government to pulling British troops out of the new structure. Mr Hague insisted: \"It is not too late for Mr Blair to change course and say we are going to bring this all back within Nato to meet all these concerns ... This will be a general election issue.\" Lord Tebbit, formerly one of Lady Thatcher's closest allies, said today that mutual respect between her and Mr Blair had evaporated \"a long time ago\". \"She did not take that long to discover that what he was saying about his Eurosceptic and Thatcherite credentials was purely for electoral purposes,\" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. \"I think he wanted to ride on her coat tails for as long as he could so perhaps it is only recently that he has felt bold enough to decide to desert that position.\" Related special reports The Thatcher era The Tories in opposition Related stories 20 April 1999: No giant is greater than Thatcher - Hague 22 November 2000: Ups and downs of Iron Lady's favourites 3 May 1999: She changed Britain and created Blair Cartoon 21 November 2000: Steve Bell on the Euro army Talk Where were you when Thatcher resigned?\" Useful sites 22 November: Maggie handbags Blair - the Sun Background: rapid reaction forces - Ministry of Defence",

      "bodyText": "OK! magazine owner Richard Desmond has bought The Express newspaper group for \u00a3125m cash, it was confirmed today. And the new owner of the Express has revealed plans to make the paper a hip and trendy publication for 18 to 34 year old females. Speaking for the first time since the deal was clinched, Mr Desmond said: \"The Express represents a vital part of Britain's press heritage of which Northern &amp; Shell are proud to have the stewardship of in the 21st Century.\" They said they were committed to \"innovation and investment\". Mr Desmond added that the editors of the three papers in the group would report to Paul Ashford, who is editorial director of Northern &amp; Shell, Mr Desmond's publishing empire. He also put paid to fears that the titles would be exiled to the company's Docklands headquarters, assuring journalists today that they papers would remain at Ludgate House. A panel of experts will be introduced to maintain the paper's editorial integrity and the paper will be \"issue led\" not \"party led\". Mr Desmond declared that the papers would offer \"powerful and passionate advocacy on matters of national concern\". However the papers showbusiness coverage, long seen as inferior to that of arch rival the Daily Mail's, will be stepped up immediately. Mr Desmond declined to give details but said the paper would engage in \"colourful celebrity coverage where appropriate.\" Tie-ups with OK! magazine are expected on a regular basis. The papers would engage in \"colourful celebrity coverage where appropriate\", he said. Lord Hollick who has owned the Express titles since 1996 said: \"The management and journalists of the Express and Star can take enormous credit for the success in strengthening both titles over the last few years. We wish the papers, and their new owners, all th ebest for the next phase of their development.\" The cash deal gives Mr Desmond control of the three national newspapers, the Express, Sunday Express, the Daily Star and the highly lucrative Westferry printing plant.",

Which is one reason why the national lottery charities board (NLCB) will disappear in four months' time. </p> <p>There is no need for the voluntary sector to tremble, though; the board's \u00a3280m a year grants, familiar staff and processes will carry on as usual, but from April they will be branded as the \"community fund\". </p> <p>A hefty bill will no doubt follow for 18 months of focus groups and image advice by Brandsmiths consultancy, plus new stationery and sorting out of temporary client befuddlement. But champagne - or the modest third sector equivalent - is being cracked open at the quango's stately central London HQ, just off Trafalgar Square, at a change many staff have wanted since day one in 1995. </p> <p>Paul Hensby, the board's chief press officer, says: \"The name is confusing and doesn't help us get the money to small groups in particular.\" Colleagues elaborate that the first two words in the name have caused endless muddle with lottery operator Camelot or with controversial grants - the Royal Opera House, the Churchill papers - made by other distributors. The last two words, meanwhile, \"smack of the lady bountiful or the grim-faced charity committees you get in Dickens\", according to NLCB veterans sounded out as part of the name review. </p> <p>Enthusiasm for something more contemporary had to be reined in, though, when at a relatively late stage in the process the thoroughly New Labour notion of the \"people fund\" was the frontrunner. Dummy logos had been prepared, but it was pointed out internally that people do not qualify for NLCB grants and, more seriously, that the name was alarmingly close to Sir Richard Branson's brand for the weekly gamble, should he win the franchise. </p> <p>The new name, says Hensby, \"will appeal to groups wanting lottery funds for community purposes, as well as larger charities\". In that respect, it stands to chime with the way the NLCB has become the sole funder of some community sectors: women's refuges in Sheffield, for instance, are almost entirely dependent on lottery funding. </p> <p>Culture secretary Chris Smith has already approved the change in principle. As one of the many who find the singulars and plurals in \"national lottery charities board\" all but impossible to master, he is expected to welcome \"community fund\".</p>",

Which is one reason why the national lottery charities board (NLCB) will disappear in four months' time. There is no need for the voluntary sector to tremble, though; the board's \u00a3280m a year grants, familiar staff and processes will carry on as usual, but from April they will be branded as the \"community fund\". A hefty bill will no doubt follow for 18 months of focus groups and image advice by Brandsmiths consultancy, plus new stationery and sorting out of temporary client befuddlement. But champagne - or the modest third sector equivalent - is being cracked open at the quango's stately central London HQ, just off Trafalgar Square, at a change many staff have wanted since day one in 1995. Paul Hensby, the board's chief press officer, says: \"The name is confusing and doesn't help us get the money to small groups in particular.\" Colleagues elaborate that the first two words in the name have caused endless muddle with lottery operator Camelot or with controversial grants - the Royal Opera House, the Churchill papers - made by other distributors. The last two words, meanwhile, \"smack of the lady bountiful or the grim-faced charity committees you get in Dickens\", according to NLCB veterans sounded out as part of the name review. Enthusiasm for something more contemporary had to be reined in, though, when at a relatively late stage in the process the thoroughly New Labour notion of the \"people fund\" was the frontrunner. Dummy logos had been prepared, but it was pointed out internally that people do not qualify for NLCB grants and, more seriously, that the name was alarmingly close to Sir Richard Branson's brand for the weekly gamble, should he win the franchise. The new name, says Hensby, \"will appeal to groups wanting lottery funds for community purposes, as well as larger charities\". In that respect, it stands to chime with the way the NLCB has become the sole funder of some community sectors: women's refuges in Sheffield, for instance, are almost entirely dependent on lottery funding. Culture secretary Chris Smith has already approved the change in principle. As one of the many who find the singulars and plurals in \"national lottery charities board\" all but impossible to master, he is expected to welcome \"community fund\".",

      "bodyText": "The government will this year facilitate nearly \u00a32bn in private sector investment in housing and regeneration, and the total is expected to rise next year. The figures were unveiled today in an investment strategy from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, setting out how it will spend its capital investment budget over the next three years. The strategy focuses the DETR's investment on modernising social housing, regenerating communities and improving energy efficiency in 1m buildings. It also reveals the extent to which private money is becoming a key factor in public spending. The \u00a32bn, which is to be invested in government-backed projects, is partly raised through public private partnerships and private finance initiative (PFI) deals set up by regional development agencies and the government regeneration body English Partnerships. Between them, they account for \u00a3739m in private sector investment, while the Housing Corporation brings in \u00a3657m and sales of council housing estates to housing associations and local housing companies another \u00a3600m. The government expects these agencies to bring in an additional \u00a3300m in private finance in 2001-02 on top of the projected \u00a32bn. Adding in projects involving local authorities, the PFI alone will generate an average \u00a31bn a year in private investment in public sector projects over the next three years, double the amount for the last financial year. The DETR's own capital spending, announced in this summer's comprehensive spending review, will rise from \u00a35.3bn to \u00a37.1bn over the review's three-year cycle.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Wednesday 1 November </strong></p> <p><strong>Alec Stewart</strong> denies taking money from an Indian bookmaker for information related to cricket matches. Stewart was one of nine foreigners plus five Indians named in the Indian CBI report published today. The report alleges that Stewart received \u00a35,000 from bookmaker <strong>Mukesh Kumar Gupta</strong> (or \"John\") in exchange for pitch, weather and team information. The report said the two were introduced by Indian allrounder <strong>Manoj Prabhakar</strong> in 1993.</p> <p>In a statement, the ECB said: \"Alec Stewart has fully cooperated with the ECB over this matter, and has categorically denied to <strong>Lord MacLaurin</strong>, chairman of the ECB, and <strong>Tim Lamb</strong>, chief executive, that he has ever taken money from Mr Gupta or anyone else, for providing information related to a cricket match. In fact, he denies ever knowingly having met Mr Gupta.\" Meanwhile Stewart will not be suspended from the England team. The ECB also proposed that <strong>Sir Paul Condon</strong>, head of the ICC's anti-corruption unit, investigate the report.</p> <p>The most shattering inclusion in the report is the allegation that <strong>Brian Lara</strong> was paid $40,000 for playing badly in two one-day internationals. Sri Lankans <strong>Arjuna Ranatunga</strong> and <strong>Aravinda de Silva</strong> were also accused of match-fixing. Ranatunga says he's never had any dealings with bookies and rejected the allegation that he had under-performed in a Test which India won six years ago. Sri Lanka's Cricket Board said it would \"most likely\" call for a criminal investigation into the allegations .</p> <p>The report, however, adds that Prabhakar's attempt to introduce Gupta to another West Indies cricketer, <strong>Gus Logie</strong>, failed.</p> <p>New Zealand's <strong>Martin Crowe</strong> was allegedly offered money in exchange for information, but he says he was tricked after Gupta posed as a journalist.</p> <p>The report also claims that <strong>Mohammad Azharuddin</strong> fixed matches and performances for Gupta, with the help of <strong>Ajay Jadeja</strong> and <strong>Nayan Mongia</strong>. <strong>Kapil Dev</strong> is exonerated by the report. Instead, it concluded that his accuser, Prabhakar, was close to several bookmakers. Former international allrounder, <strong>Ajay Sharma</strong>, is the other Indian implicated.</p> <p>Ex-Australia batsman <strong>Dean Jones</strong>, who was named in the report, also denied any involvement in match-fixing. Speaking on radio, Jones said it was common knowledge that he had been approached but said he had nothing to hide.</p> <p><strong>Hansie Cronje, Salim Malik</strong> and <strong>Mark Waugh</strong> are the other non-Indians named. Waugh was fined by the ACB in 1995 along with <strong>Shane Warne</strong> after the pair admitted accepting money from a bookie for pitch reports. The CBI report alleges that $US20,000 was paid to Waugh on a tour of Sri Lanka in 1994. <strong>Malcolm Gray</strong>, President of ICC, says that the game is facing its biggest problems since Australian tycoon <strong>Kerry Packer</strong> launched his World Series Cricket revolution in the 1970s.</p> <p><strong>Thursday 2 November</strong><br><strong> Stewart </strong> says he has not knowingly met bookmaker <strong> Mukesh Gupta </strong> and that he has never traded cricket-related information for money. He says he's been in a state of shock since the allegations were made, and that the day they broke was one of the hardest of his life.</p> <p>Reports say <strong> Mohammad Azharuddin </strong> confessed to the CBI that he had fixed two one-day internationals - one against South Africa in 1996 and another against Sri Lanka the following year. He also admitted he had thrown a one-day international against Pakistan in Jaipur in 1999. But the Indian investigators are convinced he threw many more.</p> <p>It is revealed Gupta - at the centre of the CBI report - knew nothing about cricket until he walked past a betting group in 1984. He then educated himself about the game through books and the media - including the BBC.</p> <p>The allegations against Stewart are to be looked at by <strong> Sir Paul Condon's </strong> ICC anti-corruption unit. Condon reveals his team are assisting Indian police examining the CBI report and South African officials investigating the scandal in conjunction with the King Commission. The Australian Cricket Board have also asked the unit, along with their own special investigator, <strong> Greg Melick</strong>, to look at the allegations against <strong> Mark Waugh</strong>.</p> <p><strong> Martin Crowe </strong> denies that, contrary to testimony in the CBI report, he was visited at his home by Gupta in 1991.</p> <p>The United Cricket Board of South Africa's life ban on <strong> Cronje </strong> comes into effect today. The disgraced captain is to be excluded from all activities under the control of the Board. However, the Board's president <strong> Percy Sonn </strong> gives Cronje a glimmer of hope by suggesting that if Cronje repents and makes an effort to rehabilitate himself in the game through, for instance, the coaching of youngsters, the position may be reconsidered. He hints that the UCB would require Cronje to serve at least some of the ban, though, probably between two and five years.</p> <p>Sri Lankan Cricket Board president <strong> Thilanga Sumithapala </strong> writes to the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, <strong> Dr Muttiah</strong>, to demand a copy of the CBI report. Sumithapala says he is \"perturbed\" at the allegations against <strong> de Silva </strong> and <strong> Ranatunga</strong>. Ranatunga also releases a statement denying he has been approached by a bookmaker.</p> <p><strong> Willie Rodriguez</strong>, the president of <strong> Brian Lara's </strong> home club, Queen's Park in Trinidad, says the allegations against the former West Indies captain are \"not the worth the paper they're written on\". Lara categorically denies the allegations and says the matter is in the hands of his lawyers.</p> <p><strong> Pat Rousseau</strong>, president of the West Indies Cricket Board, says he is \"appalled\" that <strong>Gus Logie </strong> is mentioned by the CBI, even though the report does not implicate him but merely says he refused to co-operate with match-fixers when they contacted him by phone. Rousseau also says the allegations against Lara \"lack credence\" and that the WICB do not intend to take any action over the report and will leave the matter in the hands of the ICC anti-corruption unit. Logie says he's \"extremely hurt\" by his inclusion.</p> <p><strong> Friday 3 November </strong> <br><strong> Stewart </strong> faces the media. He says: \"I know in my mind I'm clear, but it's my word against Gupta's word, and now it's in Sir Paul Condon's safe hands.\" Stewart says he would not recognise Gupta if he walked into the room.</p> <p>The Daily Telegraph reports that <strong> Azharuddin </strong> and <strong> Ajay Sharma </strong> are facing criminal charges. The former was captain of India and the latter is a groundsman at the Feroseshah Kotla ground so both could be considered government servants and be liable to prosecution.</p> <p>The BCCI bans <strong> Azharuddin, Sharma, Ajay Jadeja, Nayan Mongia </strong> and <strong>Manoj Prabhakar </strong> from playing all cricket under its control after they have been tainted in the report.</p> <p><strong> Lord MacLaurin </strong> denies double standards over the allegations against Stewart, saying the reason the England vice-captain stayed on the tour was because he \"co-operated fully\" with the ECB. MacLaurin was reported to have said early in England's tour to Pakistan that players under suspicion should be banned although he says his words were taken out of context. He expresses regret at the reporting of those comments in the light of relations between the two countries.</p> <p>Stewart is given the backing of chairman of selectors <strong> David Graveney </strong> who says: \"He's a shining example of what is good in English cricket.\" He says Stewart's denial is \"good enough\" for him.</p> <p><strong> Saturday 4 November </strong> <br><strong> Jadeja </strong> defends himself. He says: \"At no time in my career have I been involved with match-fixing as defined in the CBI report. He says the allegations are based on \"false and concocted evidence\".</p> <p><strong> Mihir Bose </strong> in the Daily Telegraph says the captain of a touring international team offered to pay a county \u00a315,000 to lose because the sponsors of the matches against the counties were offering \u00a350,000 to the tourists if they beat all the counties. Bose says the story is \"well-known in county cricket\".</p> <p><strong> Nasser Hussain </strong> reveals his fears for Stewart. He says Stewart has been \"hit hard\" by the allegation and hopes his name will be cleared by the time the Tests start.</p> <p><strong> Imran Khan </strong> supports the ECB's position on Stewart. He says: \"The ECB is right to keep Stewart in the team but the stance against the Pakistani players was ridiculous. The Indian report has created a stir but there is no concrete evidence against players.\" But former Pakistan captain <strong> Intikhab Alam </strong> and ex-fast bowler <strong> Sarfraz Nawaz </strong> say Stewart should be sent home.</p> <p>West Indies captain <strong> Jimmy Adams </strong> says he does not think the corruption in the game will ever be removed completely. He says: \"You will always have gambling. And that is the root problem. How do you remove that?\" Meanwhile ICC investigators meet with the CBI.</p> <p>Australia captain <strong> Steve Waugh </strong> reveals his upset for twin brother Mark. <strong> Allan Border </strong> also comes out in support of him.</p> <p><strong>Sunday 5 November </strong> <br>The Sunday Telegraph's <strong> Scyld Berry </strong> reports that the ECB has completed their secret inquiry into two matches between Essex and Lancashire in August 1991 and a police investigation is now likely. Former Essex seamer and Zimbabwe coach <strong> Don Topley </strong> alleged in newspaper articles in 1994-95 that Essex were set \"a generous declaration\" and subsequently won the Championship match between the two teams, giving them the title by 13 points. Topley alleges that the Essex team allowed Lancashire to win in the Sunday game, which helped them achieve the runners-up spot in the League.</p> <p><strong> Wasim Akram </strong> and <strong> Salim Malik </strong> were playing for Lancashire and Essex respectively and both have been implicated in the CBI report, but neither was involved here according to Topley.</p> <p>Berry says doubts remain about <strong> Stewart</strong>, \"partly because of what he said and did not say, partly because of the way he said it.\" He adds: \"Not once in almost half-an-hour of questions and answers did he use the word 'truth'. An absence of righteous indignation, of passion, was notable, too.\"</p> <p><strong> Sir Garfield Sobers </strong> tells Week Magazine that the scandal is \"the most terrible thing to happen in the game\". He says: \"I can't believe <strong> Azharuddin </strong> could do such a thing. I never expected former South Africa captain <strong> Hansie Cronje</strong>, too, to be involved in match-fixing.\"</p> <p><strong> Mongia </strong> expresses his dismay at the allegations against him. He says Azharuddin's version of events which incriminate him and Ajay Jadeja is totally false.</p> <p><strong>Monday 6 November </strong> <br><strong> Azharuddin </strong> is facing a tax bill of millions, it is reported. The Revenue Office in New Delhi says it intends to file major income-tax demands to at least five players, including Azharuddin, in the light of the CBI report.</p> <p>The Sri Lankan Board announces it has appointed the President's Counsel <strong> Desmond Fernando </strong> to look at the CBI report. He has been given 30 days to report back.</p> <p><strong> Lara </strong> says he is trying to convince his English legal advisers to allow him to speak about the latest allegations against him, otherwise he cannot comment.</p> <p>The CBI denies groundsman <strong> Ram Adhar Chaudhury </strong> was beaten up so that he would confess to taking a bribe of 50,000 rupees to doctor a pitch for a Test between India and Australia in 1996.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday 8 November </strong> <br><strong> Ram Adhar Chaudhury </strong> is suspended from his duties at the Feroseshah Kotla ground in New Delhi.</p> <p>India's Telegraph newspaper, it is reported by Vivek Chaudhary in the Guardian, has published records of heavy mobile-phone traffic allegedly between <strong> Gupta </strong> and <strong> Ajay Jadeja </strong> during New Zealand's tour to India last year. The paper says that on November 13, the day before India lost to New Zealand in Guwahati to level the one-day series 2-2, Gupta made 48 calls to Jadeja's mobile. Then, the day before India clinched the series by winning in New Delhi on November 17, Gupta made 55 calls to Jadeja. He did not play but on match day was in the dressing-room with his team-mates and received 31 calls, Chaudhary writes. Jadeja has told Indian investigators that Gupta is a \"fan\" and a \"well-wisher\".</p> <p> <strong>Friday 10 November</strong><br>A team of investigators from the ICC's Anti-Corruption Unit return to the UK following visits to India and South Africa. After consulting with the CBI, they have agreed to undertake the \"extremely detailed and complex investigations\" needed to test the allegations in the report as this does not come under the jurisdiction of the CBI.</p> <p>In South Africa they spoke to <strong> Cronje </strong> for advice to assist them in preparing a set of recommendations to help players avoid being drawn into malpractice.</p> <p>Sri Lanka drop <strong> Aravinda de Silva</strong>, who was named in the CBI report, from their 16-man squad to tour South Africa. </p> <p><strong> Saturday 11 November </strong><br><strong> Prabhakar</strong> meets the BCCI's Anti-Corruption Commissioner <strong> K Madhavan </strong> for five hours in Chennai and then tells the Press: \"The battle is over, but the war to cleanse the game is on.\" He said the CBI report was full of \"inaccuracies\", because the CBI hadn't studied the videos he gave them. He also says: \"This is the time to look for a fair decision by the BCCI Commissioner.\"</p> <p><strong> Azharuddin </strong> fails to show, and Madhavan says: \"He will be given another chance, otherwise we'll go by the evidence as reported by the CBI.\" </p> <p>Retired High Court judge <strong> Sir Ian Barker </strong> and Christchurch barrister <strong> Nick Davidson </strong> will head New Zealand Cricket's anti-corruption inquiry investigating the allegations that <strong> Martin Crowe </strong> received money from an Indian bookmaker. They will liaise with the ICC's anti-corruption unit.</p> <p><strong> Marlon Aronstam</strong>, the South African bookmaker at the centre of the Cronje scandal, speaks out in defence of players accused of providing information for money in the CBI report. He says: \"What is wrong, providing a man is playing to the best of his ability? Everybody is moaning about what <strong> Alec Stewart </strong> was (allegedly) doing in 1993, but it was not even classified by the ICC at that stage as doing anything wrong.\" Aronstam says he wouldn't ask a cricketer for anything beyond weather or pitch information. He said: \"I wouldn't want to know from a cricketer who is going to win because I think they're all bad judges anyway. If you ask cricketers for advice on what to back you've got to be stupid.\"</p> <p><strong> Sunday 12 November </strong> <br>South Africa's King Commission hearings will resume in January, according to the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>A lawyer, <strong> Shalendra Diwedi</strong>, has brought a case of treason against the five Indians and the former physio named in the CBI report. He is bringing a private prosecution in the Central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh because \"they have sullied the name of his country\".</p> <p>Madhavan questions <strong> Jadeja, Mongia </strong> and former Indian team physio <strong> Ali Irani </strong> \u00dc <strong> Sharma </strong> is indisposed.</p> <p><strong> Monday 13 November </strong> <br>New Zealand Cricket will carefully consider whether it will take part in meaningless international one-day tournaments again, according to chief executive <strong> Christopher Doig </strong> in Christchurch. He said: \"There is too much meaningless one-day cricket and there is no doubt that has played some part in the match-fixing and dishonesty that has occurred in cricket.\"</p> <p>The CBI launches a probe into the awarding of TV rights for matches. In Calcutta, the residence of former ICC president <strong> Jagmohan Dalmiya </strong> is raided as the CBI search for information related to the sale of TV rights for, among other tournaments, the 1996 and 1999 World Cups, and the 1998 ICC Knockout.</p> <p><strong> Tuesday 14 November </strong><br>CBI director <strong> RK Raghaven </strong> says the agency is turning its attention to cricket's murky links with the criminal underworld. A few Indian players and administrators are alleged to have links with the mafia. <strong>Azharuddin </strong> told the CBI that he had been rung up on a couple of occasions and asked to fix matches by them but he had refused.</p> <p><strong> Wednesday 15 November </strong><br><strong> Dalmiya </strong> accuses the CBI of \"harassment\".</p> <p><strong> Thursday 16 November </strong><br><strong> Mihir Bose </strong> of the Daily Telegraph says the King Commission has been told by the South African government to submit its report on corruption by the end of the month without any further hearings. He says since the interim report was published three months ago, lawyers have gathered further evidence from bank transactions and discussions with New Delhi police.</p> <p><strong> Friday November 17 </strong><br><strong> Bose </strong> now says that <strong> Cronje </strong> will be questioned further by the King Commission when it holds its final-round hearings from January 25. The Commission will look into allegations stretching back to the Mandela Cup in 1994 (when Cronje was appointed captain). There were claims at the first hearings that Cronje was offered a bribe during that tournament but rejected it after consulting with a senior team-mate.</p> <p><strong> Madhavan </strong> talks to <strong> Azharuddin </strong> for six hours, and then asks the media to \"try not to grill him\" after persuading the former India captain to face them.</p> <p><strong> Alec Stewart </strong> is \"absolutely clear\" of any involvement in match-fixing, according to <strong> Lord MacLaurin </strong> on BBC Radio.</p> <p><strong> Saturday 18 November </strong><br>The ECB dismisses remarks by the MCC's <strong> Lord Alexander of Weeden </strong> that international cricketers should be paid more so they will be less likely to be tempted to take part in match-fixing. The ECB says there is no justification for the cricketers to succumb.</p> <p>ECB Chief Executive <strong> Tim Lamb </strong> criticises the Indian authorities for publicly naming foreign players in the CBI report. He said: \"It is unfortunate. I am not a lawyer, but had this been done in the UK, a defamation case would have been filed.\" He also says: \"There is no basis for suspending <strong> Alec Stewart </strong> on allegations that are unsubstantiated, not sustainable in law.\"</p> <p><strong> Ajay Sharma </strong> is grilled by <strong> Madhavan </strong> for four hours. Madhavan says he has not ruled out the possibility of summoning more cricketers.</p> <p><strong> Sunday 19 November </strong><br>According to the Sunday Telegraph, ICC president <strong> Malcolm Gray </strong> has come closest yet to offering an official admission that the sport's administrators had created the corrupt environment in which match-fixing could flourish. Gray is reported to have said: \"Administrators were slow, naive, wrong and any other adjective you'd like to use for not recognising and dealing with it earlier. With all the TV deals there has been enormous money flooding into the sport and administrators didn't have the experience to deal with such amounts.\" Gray also suggested that the proliferation of one-day tournaments without a context had contributed to the scandal \u00dc in stark contrast to the views of <strong> Dalmiya </strong> and ICC chief executive <strong> David Richards</strong>.</p> <p><strong> Scyld Berry </strong> says Tim Lamb's comments about the allegations against Stewart (\"We have no way of finding out whether he's telling the truth\") are in contrast to the \"absolutely closed\" views of MacLaurin, and are the ECB's attempts to put some clear water between themselves and the ex-England captain in case of further revelations.</p> <p> <strong> Tuesday 21 November </strong><br>A court in Pakistan has summoned <strong> Wasim Akram </strong> and four others playing against England to answer a petition seeking their suspension on match-fixing charges. The Sindh High Court has ordered <strong> Akram, Waqar Younis, Inzamam, Saeed Anwar </strong> and <strong>Mushtaq Ahmed </strong> to appear before a two-judge bench on December 12. Banned duo <strong> Salim Malik </strong> and <strong>Ata-ur-Rehman </strong>, who spent his summer playing league cricket in Lancashire, have also been asked to appear.</p> <p>The petition was made by lawyer <strong> Abdul Qadir Mandokhail </strong> who demanded the suspension of the players from the national team after they were penalised in the Qayyum report in May. Mandokhail claimed that since the players were found guilty they should be barred. Mandokhail's petition was rejected by <strong> Justice Sabihuddin Ahmed </strong> in September on the grounds that the players live outside Sindh. However, Mandokhail's review petition was accepted by the provincial high court earlier this month.</p> <p><em>Watch this space</em></p> <p> <em>Watch this space</em></p>",

The report, however, adds that Prabhakar's attempt to introduce Gupta to another West Indies cricketer, Gus Logie, failed. New Zealand's Martin Crowe was allegedly offered money in exchange for information, but he says he was tricked after Gupta posed as a journalist. The report also claims that Mohammad Azharuddin fixed matches and performances for Gupta, with the help of Ajay Jadeja and Nayan Mongia. Kapil Dev is exonerated by the report.

The CBI report alleges that $US20,000 was paid to Waugh on a tour of Sri Lanka in 1994. Malcolm Gray, President of ICC, says that the game is facing its biggest problems since Australian tycoon Kerry Packer launched his World Series Cricket revolution in the 1970s. Thursday 2 November Stewart says he has not knowingly met bookmaker Mukesh Gupta and that he has never traded cricket-related information for money. He says he's been in a state of shock since the allegations were made, and that the day they broke was one of the hardest of his life. Reports say Mohammad Azharuddin confessed to the CBI that he had fixed two one-day internationals - one against South Africa in 1996 and another against Sri Lanka the following year. He also admitted he had thrown a one-day international against Pakistan in Jaipur in 1999. But the Indian investigators are convinced he threw many more. It is revealed Gupta - at the centre of the CBI report - knew nothing about cricket until he walked past a betting group in 1984. He then educated himself about the game through books and the media - including the BBC. The allegations against Stewart are to be looked at by Sir Paul Condon's ICC anti-corruption unit. Condon reveals his team are assisting Indian police examining the CBI report and South African officials investigating the scandal in conjunction with the King Commission. The Australian Cricket Board have also asked the unit, along with their own special investigator, Greg Melick, to look at the allegations against Mark Waugh. Martin Crowe denies that, contrary to testimony in the CBI report, he was visited at his home by Gupta in 1991. The United Cricket Board of South Africa's life ban on Cronje comes into effect today. The disgraced captain is to be excluded from all activities under the control of the Board. However, the Board's president Percy Sonn gives Cronje a glimmer of hope by suggesting that if Cronje repents and makes an effort to rehabilitate himself in the game through, for instance, the coaching of youngsters, the position may be reconsidered. He hints that the UCB would require Cronje to serve at least some of the ban, though, probably between two and five years. Sri Lankan Cricket Board president Thilanga Sumithapala writes to the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Dr Muttiah, to demand a copy of the CBI report. Sumithapala says he is \"perturbed\" at the allegations against de Silva and Ranatunga. Ranatunga also releases a statement denying he has been approached by a bookmaker. Willie Rodriguez, the president of Brian Lara's home club, Queen's Park in Trinidad, says the allegations against the former West Indies captain are \"not the worth the paper they're written on\". Lara categorically denies the allegations and says the matter is in the hands of his lawyers. Pat Rousseau, president of the West Indies Cricket Board, says he is \"appalled\" that Gus Logie is mentioned by the CBI, even though the report does not implicate him but merely says he refused to co-operate with match-fixers when they contacted him by phone. Rousseau also says the allegations against Lara \"lack credence\" and that the WICB do not intend to take any action over the report and will leave the matter in the hands of the ICC anti-corruption unit. Logie says he's \"extremely hurt\" by his inclusion. Friday 3 November Stewart faces the media. He says: \"I know in my mind I'm clear, but it's my word against Gupta's word, and now it's in Sir Paul Condon's safe hands.\" Stewart says he would not recognise Gupta if he walked into the room. The Daily Telegraph reports that Azharuddin and Ajay Sharma are facing criminal charges. The former was captain of India and the latter is a groundsman at the Feroseshah Kotla ground so both could be considered government servants and be liable to prosecution. The BCCI bans Azharuddin, Sharma, Ajay Jadeja, Nayan Mongia and Manoj Prabhakar from playing all cricket under its control after they have been tainted in the report. Lord MacLaurin denies double standards over the allegations against Stewart, saying the reason the England vice-captain stayed on the tour was because he \"co-operated fully\" with the ECB. MacLaurin was reported to have said early in England's tour to Pakistan that players under suspicion should be banned although he says his words were taken out of context. He expresses regret at the reporting of those comments in the light of relations between the two countries. Stewart is given the backing of chairman of selectors David Graveney who says: \"He's a shining example of what is good in English cricket.\" He says Stewart's denial is \"good enough\" for him. Saturday 4 November Jadeja defends himself. He says: \"At no time in my career have I been involved with match-fixing as defined in the CBI report. He says the allegations are based on \"false and concocted evidence\". Mihir Bose in the Daily Telegraph says the captain of a touring international team offered to pay a county \u00a315,000 to lose because the sponsors of the matches against the counties were offering \u00a350,000 to the tourists if they beat all the counties. Bose says the story is \"well-known in county cricket\". Nasser Hussain reveals his fears for Stewart. He says Stewart has been \"hit hard\" by the allegation and hopes his name will be cleared by the time the Tests start. Imran Khan supports the ECB's position on Stewart. He says: \"The ECB is right to keep Stewart in the team but the stance against the Pakistani players was ridiculous. The Indian report has created a stir but there is no concrete evidence against players.\" But former Pakistan captain Intikhab Alam and ex-fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz say Stewart should be sent home. West Indies captain Jimmy Adams says he does not think the corruption in the game will ever be removed completely. He says: \"You will always have gambling. And that is the root problem. How do you remove that?\" Meanwhile ICC investigators meet with the CBI. Australia captain Steve Waugh reveals his upset for twin brother Mark. Allan Border also comes out in support of him. Sunday 5 November The Sunday Telegraph's Scyld Berry reports that the ECB has completed their secret inquiry into two matches between Essex and Lancashire in August 1991 and a police investigation is now likely. Former Essex seamer and Zimbabwe coach Don Topley alleged in newspaper articles in 1994-95 that Essex were set \"a generous declaration\" and subsequently won the Championship match between the two teams, giving them the title by 13 points. Topley alleges that the Essex team allowed Lancashire to win in the Sunday game, which helped them achieve the runners-up spot in the League. Wasim Akram and Salim Malik were playing for Lancashire and Essex respectively and both have been implicated in the CBI report, but neither was involved here according to Topley. Berry says doubts remain about Stewart, \"partly because of what he said and did not say, partly because of the way he said it.\" He adds: \"Not once in almost half-an-hour of questions and answers did he use the word 'truth'. An absence of righteous indignation, of passion, was notable, too.\" Sir Garfield Sobers tells Week Magazine that the scandal is \"the most terrible thing to happen in the game\". He says: \"I can't believe Azharuddin could do such a thing. I never expected former South Africa captain Hansie Cronje, too, to be involved in match-fixing.\" Mongia expresses his dismay at the allegations against him. He says Azharuddin's version of events which incriminate him and Ajay Jadeja is totally false. Monday 6 November Azharuddin is facing a tax bill of millions, it is reported. The Revenue Office in New Delhi says it intends to file major income-tax demands to at least five players, including Azharuddin, in the light of the CBI report. The Sri Lankan Board announces it has appointed the President's Counsel Desmond Fernando to look at the CBI report. He has been given 30 days to report back. Lara says he is trying to convince his English legal advisers to allow him to speak about the latest allegations against him, otherwise he cannot comment. The CBI denies groundsman Ram Adhar Chaudhury was beaten up so that he would confess to taking a bribe of 50,000 rupees to doctor a pitch for a Test between India and Australia in 1996. Wednesday 8 November Ram Adhar Chaudhury is suspended from his duties at the Feroseshah Kotla ground in New Delhi. India's Telegraph newspaper, it is reported by Vivek Chaudhary in the Guardian, has published records of heavy mobile-phone traffic allegedly between Gupta and Ajay Jadeja during New Zealand's tour to India last year. The paper says that on November 13, the day before India lost to New Zealand in Guwahati to level the one-day series 2-2, Gupta made 48 calls to Jadeja's mobile. Then, the day before India clinched the series by winning in New Delhi on November 17, Gupta made 55 calls to Jadeja. He did not play but on match day was in the dressing-room with his team-mates and received 31 calls, Chaudhary writes. Jadeja has told Indian investigators that Gupta is a \"fan\" and a \"well-wisher\". Friday 10 November A team of investigators from the ICC's Anti-Corruption Unit return to the UK following visits to India and South Africa. After consulting with the CBI, they have agreed to undertake the \"extremely detailed and complex investigations\" needed to test the allegations in the report as this does not come under the jurisdiction of the CBI. In South Africa they spoke to Cronje for advice to assist them in preparing a set of recommendations to help players avoid being drawn into malpractice. Sri Lanka drop Aravinda de Silva, who was named in the CBI report, from their 16-man squad to tour South Africa. Saturday 11 November Prabhakar meets the BCCI's Anti-Corruption Commissioner K Madhavan for five hours in Chennai and then tells the Press: \"The battle is over, but the war to cleanse the game is on.\" He said the CBI report was full of \"inaccuracies\", because the CBI hadn't studied the videos he gave them. He also says: \"This is the time to look for a fair decision by the BCCI Commissioner.\" Azharuddin fails to show, and Madhavan says: \"He will be given another chance, otherwise we'll go by the evidence as reported by the CBI.\" Retired High Court judge Sir Ian Barker and Christchurch barrister Nick Davidson will head New Zealand Cricket's anti-corruption inquiry investigating the allegations that Martin Crowe received money from an Indian bookmaker. They will liaise with the ICC's anti-corruption unit. Marlon Aronstam, the South African bookmaker at the centre of the Cronje scandal, speaks out in defence of players accused of providing information for money in the CBI report. He says: \"What is wrong, providing a man is playing to the best of his ability? Everybody is moaning about what Alec Stewart was (allegedly) doing in 1993, but it was not even classified by the ICC at that stage as doing anything wrong.\" Aronstam says he wouldn't ask a cricketer for anything beyond weather or pitch information. He said: \"I wouldn't want to know from a cricketer who is going to win because I think they're all bad judges anyway. If you ask cricketers for advice on what to back you've got to be stupid.\" Sunday 12 November South Africa's King Commission hearings will resume in January, according to the Daily Telegraph. A lawyer, Shalendra Diwedi, has brought a case of treason against the five Indians and the former physio named in the CBI report. He is bringing a private prosecution in the Central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh because \"they have sullied the name of his country\". Madhavan questions Jadeja, Mongia and former Indian team physio Ali Irani \u00dc Sharma is indisposed. Monday 13 November New Zealand Cricket will carefully consider whether it will take part in meaningless international one-day tournaments again, according to chief executive Christopher Doig in Christchurch. He said: \"There is too much meaningless one-day cricket and there is no doubt that has played some part in the match-fixing and dishonesty that has occurred in cricket.\" The CBI launches a probe into the awarding of TV rights for matches. In Calcutta, the residence of former ICC president Jagmohan Dalmiya is raided as the CBI search for information related to the sale of TV rights for, among other tournaments, the 1996 and 1999 World Cups, and the 1998 ICC Knockout. Tuesday 14 November CBI director RK Raghaven says the agency is turning its attention to cricket's murky links with the criminal underworld. A few Indian players and administrators are alleged to have links with the mafia. Azharuddin told the CBI that he had been rung up on a couple of occasions and asked to fix matches by them but he had refused. Wednesday 15 November Dalmiya accuses the CBI of \"harassment\". Thursday 16 November Mihir Bose of the Daily Telegraph says the King Commission has been told by the South African government to submit its report on corruption by the end of the month without any further hearings. He says since the interim report was published three months ago, lawyers have gathered further evidence from bank transactions and discussions with New Delhi police. Friday November 17 Bose now says that Cronje will be questioned further by the King Commission when it holds its final-round hearings from January 25. The Commission will look into allegations stretching back to the Mandela Cup in 1994 (when Cronje was appointed captain). There were claims at the first hearings that Cronje was offered a bribe during that tournament but rejected it after consulting with a senior team-mate. Madhavan talks to Azharuddin for six hours, and then asks the media to \"try not to grill him\" after persuading the former India captain to face them. Alec Stewart is \"absolutely clear\" of any involvement in match-fixing, according to Lord MacLaurin on BBC Radio. Saturday 18 November The ECB dismisses remarks by the MCC's Lord Alexander of Weeden that international cricketers should be paid more so they will be less likely to be tempted to take part in match-fixing. The ECB says there is no justification for the cricketers to succumb. ECB Chief Executive Tim Lamb criticises the Indian authorities for publicly naming foreign players in the CBI report. He said: \"It is unfortunate. I am not a lawyer, but had this been done in the UK, a defamation case would have been filed.\" He also says: \"There is no basis for suspending Alec Stewart on allegations that are unsubstantiated, not sustainable in law.\" Ajay Sharma is grilled by Madhavan for four hours. Madhavan says he has not ruled out the possibility of summoning more cricketers. Sunday 19 November According to the Sunday Telegraph, ICC president Malcolm Gray has come closest yet to offering an official admission that the sport's administrators had created the corrupt environment in which match-fixing could flourish. Gray is reported to have said: \"Administrators were slow, naive, wrong and any other adjective you'd like to use for not recognising and dealing with it earlier. With all the TV deals there has been enormous money flooding into the sport and administrators didn't have the experience to deal with such amounts.\" Gray also suggested that the proliferation of one-day tournaments without a context had contributed to the scandal \u00dc in stark contrast to the views of Dalmiya and ICC chief executive David Richards. Scyld Berry says Tim Lamb's comments about the allegations against Stewart (\"We have no way of finding out whether he's telling the truth\") are in contrast to the \"absolutely closed\" views of MacLaurin, and are the ECB's attempts to put some clear water between themselves and the ex-England captain in case of further revelations. Tuesday 21 November A court in Pakistan has summoned Wasim Akram and four others playing against England to answer a petition seeking their suspension on match-fixing charges. The Sindh High Court has ordered Akram, Waqar Younis, Inzamam, Saeed Anwar and Mushtaq Ahmed to appear before a two-judge bench on December 12. Banned duo Salim Malik and Ata-ur-Rehman , who spent his summer playing league cricket in Lancashire, have also been asked to appear. The petition was made by lawyer Abdul Qadir Mandokhail who demanded the suspension of the players from the national team after they were penalised in the Qayyum report in May. Mandokhail claimed that since the players were found guilty they should be barred. Mandokhail's petition was rejected by Justice Sabihuddin Ahmed in September on the grounds that the players live outside Sindh. However, Mandokhail's review petition was accepted by the provincial high court earlier this month. Watch this space Watch this space",

And speculation is mounting that Express editor Rosie Boycott will be replaced sooner rather than later. Rumours were rife that Mr Desmond will try to poach News of the World editor Rebekah Wade or Sue Douglas from the Scotsman as a replacement for Ms Boycott. One journalist said: \"It's complete chaos here. The journalists can harldy get in the building with the number of people who are camped outside. \"Nobody has told us anything. Rosie Boycott is still in her office and taking calls and seems perfectly okay.\" The reaction of staff to the sale has been mixed. Journalists on the down-market Star believe Mr Desmond, whose magazines include top-shelf titles Penthouse UK, Forum and Asian Babes, could be a life-saver. Staff on the Express are more anxious. One journalist said: \"The porn element of Desmond's business is worrying. Will he take it downmarket? It will be completely different to Rosie's regime of love and peace. \"She will never get on with him. It is obvious to everyone here that she couldn't work for someone who produces soft porn.\" The fears of Express staff were fuelled by a spoof Evening Standard sandwich board erected outside its offices reading, \"Porn King buys Express\". The London evening paper is owned by the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, who were excluded from bidding for the Express by owner Lord Hollick. \"We can't believe it's a porn guy not the Hindujas,\" said one incredulous journalist.",

      "bodyText": "Al Gore's hopes of winning the White House rose dramatically early today when the Florida supreme court ruled decisively in his favour in his dispute with George W Bush over election recounts. The seven-member court, in a late evening 42-page ruling in the state capital Tallahassee, voted unanimously that hand recounts in three heavily populated south Florida counties had to be included in official tallies to be certified by the state's Republican secretary of state, Katherine Harris. The counties have until 5pm on Sunday to complete their counts and submit them to Ms Harris - or she could decide to accept them up until 9am on Monday. The court said that \"the right of the people to cast their vote is the paramount concern overriding all others\". After a nail-biting day of waiting for both presidential hopefuls and their legal teams, a court official appeared on the steps of the Florida supreme court building in Tallahassee just after 9pm local time (2am GMT) and said an \"important announcement\" would be made at 9.45pm. Then, right on timetable, the court spokesman Craig Waters stepped into the floodlights and announced the court's pivotal 7-0 verdict. The court's decision is a huge legal blow for Mr Bush, who still leads by 930 votes in the preliminary count of votes in Florida. After last night's decision, however, the doors have been kept open to enable Mr Gore every chance to claw back the advantage and per haps claim Florida's 25 electoral college votes. Those 25 votes are now the absolutely decisive last piece in the arithmetic of the US electoral college system. With 270 votes required for victory, Mr Gore is now on 267, with Mr Bush on 246. The two rivals both watched the crucial announcement on television at their official residences, Mr Gore in Washington and Mr Bush in Austin. Earlier, Mr Gore's allies had signalled that the US vice-president was considering a quick decision to abandon his White House contest with George W Bush as early as today if the Florida Supreme Court had ruled in favour of Mr Bush. Before yesterday's supreme court decision, Al Gore's allies had signalled that the US vice-president was considering a quick decision to abandon his White House contest with George W Bush if the Florida supreme court ruled in favour of Mr Bush on the two-week old disputed election in the state. As all sides in the battle for victory in Florida tensely awaited the court's crucial ruling, a senior ally travelled to the state on Mr Gore's behalf to say that a judgment in favour of Mr Bush could mark the end of the road for the vice-president's efforts to take the 25 Florida electoral college votes that hold the key to the White House. Senator Bob Kerrey, of Nebraska, a Democrat, said he had spoken to Mr Gore after Monday's court process in Tallahassee. He said Mr Gore had told him the process had been fair and that he was \"optimistic that the court's going to make a judgment that both sides are going to be able to trust\". Senator Kerrey said that if the verdict went against Mr Gore, he would join fellow Democrats such as Senator John Breaux of Louisiana and former Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia in pressing the vice-president to end further legal challenges to the November 7 election.

While the judges weighed up whether to instruct officials to await the results of hand recounts in three south Florida counties, the count continued. Mr Gore had picked up 242 net votes compared with Mr Bush in the three recounts by late afternoon yesterday. However, hundreds of disputed ballot papers remained uncounted in all three counties. In Broward, with 606 of 609 precincts recounted, Mr Gore had gained a net 125 votes. In Palm Beach county, with 104 of 531 precincts counted, Mr Gore had a net gain of just three. In the third and largest county, Miami-Dade, Mr Gore's net gain was 114 with 99 of the 614 precincts counted.

      "bodyText": "The government has spelled out how it will double capital investment in public services over the next three years in order to bring hospital buildings, GP surgeries, and social housing up to scratch. All 23 government departments today published three year investment strategies outlining their plans to disburse the increases in capital spending announced by chancellor Gordon Brown in July. Prime minister Tony Blair launched the investment plans, saying the government had \"a vital responsibility to maintain and improve the nation's infrastructure\". Spending plans include \u00a31.4bn a year to repair the health service's crumbling infrastructure and replace \"unsafe\", outdated, and inefficient medical equipment and facilities. Nearly \u00a32bn is to be generated from the private sector this year in order to invest in upgrading social housing, regenerating communities and improving energy efficiency in 1m buildings. Blair said the government would double the proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) committed to public investment in the next three years in order to tackle the \"dire\" situation it inherited in 1997. But he also accepted some blame for public sector underinvestment. \"I accept that because we were taking the action necessary for laying stable economic foundations, in our first two years we were unable to get in as much investment as we know our public services need,\" he said. Investment plans include: \u0095 A \u00a31.4bn increase in NHS capital spending. This will include: 100 major new hospital projects by 2010; 250 new scanners; and modernisation of more than 3,000 GP premises; \u0095 Half a million houses to be brought up to a \"decent\" standard by 2004 - cutting by a third the number of families living in poor social housing. All social housing will be \"decent\" by 2010. A Treasury white paper published simultaneously today outlines a new framework by which each department's spending will be monitored, inlcuding the introduction of commercial accounting techniques. Each department will be required to update and publish their investment strategies, while all large capital projects will be put through a \"rigorous process of scrutiny\" by the new Office of Government Commerce.",

      "bodyText": "Four Palestinians, one reportedly a woman, were killed by Israeli troops near a Jewish settlement today. The deaths came as the Egyptian ambassador to Israel headed home in protest over a rocket attack on the Gaza Strip earlier this week. Israel and the Palestinians gave conflicting accounts of the shooting near the Jewish settlement of Morag at the southern end of Gaza. Palestinian security officials said Israeli troops fired without provocation from tank-mounted machine guns at two cars with Palestinian civilians passing by Morag. The army said a Palestinian car drove toward the Morag junction at high speed, and that soldiers fired at the vehicle. An army spokesman added that it was not clear whether shots were first fired at the troops from the Palestinian car. Khaled Abu Ola, a Palestinian liaison officer based in Jerusalem, said Israel informed Palestinian police that four Palestinians were killed in the shooting. The shooting was the latest incident in a new spiral of violence set off on Monday by a bomb attack on an Israeli school bus. In retaliation for that attack, Israeli helicopters blasted Palestinian security offices in Gaza, killing two Palestinians in what the United States has said was a show of excessive force. In response to the rocketing, Egypt recalled its ambassador to Israel, Mohammed Bassiouny, and the Jordanian prime minister, Ali Abu-Ragheb, said his country's new ambassador to Israel would not present his credentials \"until Israel ends its attacks.\" Mr Bassiouny, who has been in Israel for two decades, left the Egyptian embassy in Tel Aviv this morning, saying farewell to the staff, and then headed to the Israeli-Egyptian border by car, embassy officials said. Also today, Israeli tanks and armoured personnel carriers were brought into the Gaza Strip, cutting it in two and preventing Palestinian traffic between its northern and southern parts. The military build-up came in response to the fatal shooting yesterday of an 18-year-old Israeli from a Gaza settlement by a Palestinian sniper. The killing of the Israeli came just hours after Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian security officer nearby. They said he was approaching their position suspiciously. Israeli army bulldozers cleared Palestinian orchards and buildings away from a Gaza intersection near the isolated Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom, where the Israeli was shot, following a pattern of securing Israeli-held areas of the violence-shattered territory by flattening large swaths of land.

Maybe a teacher in the town's primary school?\" He wonders too whether he would have contracted the cancer. \"Is life like a chess competition, where with one wrong move we change the result completely?\" Mr Lu has been interviewed by a TV station and several newspapers. \"The problem\", he writes, \"is that the reporters' questions are usually so 'big'.\" \"They will ask the meaning of life and death. They make me feel I should be given a doctorate if I can answer just one question right.\" Mr Lu has asked his publisher to burn some books on serious subjects at his grave instead of offerings of paper money: \"Then I will have enough time to digest them.\"",

      "bodyText": "Labour ministers can no longer duck the need to reform private schools in order to create a level playing field with the state sector, a think tank has warned. A pamphlet published today by the left-of-centre Fabian Society claims that independent schools remain a barrier to Labour's aim of achieving educational equality in Britain, yet under Tony Blair's government they \"have been left largely unmolested\". The author of the report, Harry Brighouse of London University's institute of education, called for a new relationship between the sectors to ensure that the benefits of private education - more money, better resources and good academic results - are more widely distributed for the benefit of all pupils. Professor Brighouse recognised in the pamphlet, A Level Playing Field: The Reform of Private Schools, that abolishing private schools was not feasible. He said Labour should instead consider three main reforms for a second term in government - stripping private schools of their right to select pupils; providing incentives for state school children to be admitted to Oxbridge; and setting a timetable by which spending in the state sector would match spending in the private sector. Around 6.5% of pupils in Britain are educated privately yet more than half the undergraduates at Oxford come from fee-paying schools. Prof Brighouse pointed out that Labour's 1997 election manifesto \"was silent about private schools\", apart from a pledge to phase out the Tories' assisted places scheme. This provided government funding for bright children from families who could not afford private school fees.

Rio has not signed for Leeds yet. They have a very big Uefa Champions League match to play tonight, so he will travel up tomorrow to talk to them. Then it is up to him.\"</p> <p>Leeds will make Ferdinand the highest-priced player in the English game, his fee eclipsing the \u00a315m record held jointly by Alan Shearer and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Ferdinand will also shatter the world record for a defender, the \u00a313m paid by Roma for the Argentine Walter Samuel in June.</p> <p>This morning Ridsdale said he did not wish to comment further until meeting with Ferdinand tomorrow, but Leeds' assistant manager Eddie Gray said he welcomed the move. \"The boy is a top-class player and if we could add to the squad at the present time, it would be very helpful,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. </p> <p>\"He played very well on Saturday, there is no doubt the boy has tremendous ability,\" he continued. \"It is a lot of money, but all great things start at the back and we have got one or two defenders at the club who are top class. If we can add to that, then all's well and good.\"</p> <p>It is believed Bayern Munich's late intervention, with the German champions ready to offer \u00a316m, prompted Leeds to improve their offer to one that simply could not be refused. West Ham have always been reluctant to sell their most prized asset to another Premiership club and believed they could prise even more from the likes of Barcelona and Roma.</p> <p>West Ham manager Harry Redknapp has admitted to having mixed feelings over the proposed deal - but uncertainty over the future of the transfer market, plus the sheer size of the fee, appears to have finally broken the club's resistance. </p> <p>\"With the transfer system what it is at the moment, it could all fall to pieces in a month's time and he could be walking away for next to nothing,\" Redknapp told the club's official website. </p> <p>\"I don't want to lose Rio, he's a fantastic player and will go on to be one of the best in Europe. I've never changed my opinion about that, but \u00a318m breaks all sorts of records really and it's a difficult one to turn down. </p> <p>\"Resources are resources; it's a small ground, and you can't keep everybody. If the transfer system falls apart in a couple of months we're going to look very foolish, so I can understand where the chairman is coming from. </p> <p>\"Anyone who thinks I don't want to keep him is a fool,\" he continued. \"But we're not Arsenal, Manchester United, or Liverpool - we're West Ham. But don't think I'm going to go home and sleep easy knowing a player like that is going to leave. </p> <p>\"At the end of the day everyone has got their price. The chairman, who asks me about everything, is as good as gold - and \u00a318m is a lot of money for someone who might walk away for \u00a35m. How can that be sensible? </p> <p>\"We dug our heels in at the offer of \u00a315m and that extra \u00a33m is a lot of money to a club like West Ham.\" </p> <p>Redknapp has pledged to use the money generated from Ferdinand's proposed transfer to strengthen the squad, but insisted that he would resist the temptation to make one or two big signings. </p> <p>\"I have to keep wheeling and dealing,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can go out and find another bargain like Freddie (Kanoute). I was told one paper said someone wants to pay \u00a38m for him - I only paid \u00a33.5m. </p> <p>\"Without blowing my own trumpet I keep picking up bargains like that and I've got to try and find another couple now with Rio's money - if he goes,\" he added. \"To be honest, I probably want to wait and see what happens with the transfer system.\"</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

This morning Ridsdale said he did not wish to comment further until meeting with Ferdinand tomorrow, but Leeds' assistant manager Eddie Gray said he welcomed the move. \"The boy is a top-class player and if we could add to the squad at the present time, it would be very helpful,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"He played very well on Saturday, there is no doubt the boy has tremendous ability,\" he continued. \"It is a lot of money, but all great things start at the back and we have got one or two defenders at the club who are top class. If we can add to that, then all's well and good.\" It is believed Bayern Munich's late intervention, with the German champions ready to offer \u00a316m, prompted Leeds to improve their offer to one that simply could not be refused. West Ham have always been reluctant to sell their most prized asset to another Premiership club and believed they could prise even more from the likes of Barcelona and Roma. West Ham manager Harry Redknapp has admitted to having mixed feelings over the proposed deal - but uncertainty over the future of the transfer market, plus the sheer size of the fee, appears to have finally broken the club's resistance. \"With the transfer system what it is at the moment, it could all fall to pieces in a month's time and he could be walking away for next to nothing,\" Redknapp told the club's official website. \"I don't want to lose Rio, he's a fantastic player and will go on to be one of the best in Europe. I've never changed my opinion about that, but \u00a318m breaks all sorts of records really and it's a difficult one to turn down. \"Resources are resources; it's a small ground, and you can't keep everybody. If the transfer system falls apart in a couple of months we're going to look very foolish, so I can understand where the chairman is coming from. \"Anyone who thinks I don't want to keep him is a fool,\" he continued. \"But we're not Arsenal, Manchester United, or Liverpool - we're West Ham. But don't think I'm going to go home and sleep easy knowing a player like that is going to leave. \"At the end of the day everyone has got their price. The chairman, who asks me about everything, is as good as gold - and \u00a318m is a lot of money for someone who might walk away for \u00a35m. How can that be sensible? \"We dug our heels in at the offer of \u00a315m and that extra \u00a33m is a lot of money to a club like West Ham.\" Redknapp has pledged to use the money generated from Ferdinand's proposed transfer to strengthen the squad, but insisted that he would resist the temptation to make one or two big signings. \"I have to keep wheeling and dealing,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can go out and find another bargain like Freddie (Kanoute). I was told one paper said someone wants to pay \u00a38m for him - I only paid \u00a33.5m. \"Without blowing my own trumpet I keep picking up bargains like that and I've got to try and find another couple now with Rio's money - if he goes,\" he added. \"To be honest, I probably want to wait and see what happens with the transfer system.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Like the first cuckoo of spring, the magic word \"Oscar\" attached to film publicity heralds the arrival of the annual Academy awards spin season, even though the voting is still four months away. Just as an American presidential election campaign starts years before the actual vote - and in some cases goes on after it - so the film industry believes that it is never too early to start positioning your film and its stars as worthy of consideration for an Oscar. This year, with the field still wide open, the studios have just opened their wallets and started bankrolling their favourites and over the next few months millions of dollars will be invested in seeking the elusive nominations. If a critic for any small radio station or obscure magazine wants to see his or her name in print, now is the time to write \"Oscar-worthy\" in a review, guaranteeing the author's blessed words an appearance on newspaper ads for the film. Publicity Men of Honour, which stars Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr, and Pay It Forward, which stars Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment, are just two of the films already being presented for the attentions of the academy members. \"Suddenly Joan Allen, Gary Oldman, Jeff Bridges and Rod Lurie's screenplay are Oscar contenders,\" says a review for The Contender, the story of a vice-presidential candidate and a sexual scandal, presumably in the hope that America has not had too much of vice-presidents in elections to last it until awards day on March 25. \"Ellen Burstyn's performance is of Oscar calibre,\" says a review attached to Requiem for a Dream. \"It definitely gets more intense every year,\" says Patrick Goldstein, who writes the Big Picture column in the LA Times. \"There is as much spinning going on in the Oscars as in what has been happening in Florida after the presidential election.\" The publicists have already started to try to \"plant things in our ears\", says Goldstein, and the LA Times and the New York Times are the places where they place their highest hopes. The promoters of Gladiator will doubtless be pleased to see that a still from their film appears next to an article on the Oscars in the New York Times, despite the fact that the film appeared early in the year and was seen as sound and enjoyable rather than prize-winning stuff. Another procedure being adopted is the re-release of films that failed to attract a large audience when they first appeared but are felt by studios to be worthy of consideration. The latest to get this treatment is Wonder Boys, starring Michael Douglas and directed by Curtis Hanson: both of whom are previous Oscar winners. Next month come the first of the critics' awards, with special attention again paid to LA and New York, and the Golden Globe nominations made by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Not to be outdone, the British Bafta awards have been moved forward to January so that they become part of the process rather than a postscript. Publicists now have the delicate task of promoting their hopefuls without alienating directors, producers and actors who are not to be so favoured. Budgets purely to promote an Oscar bid, which may include persuading the actors to go on the publicity circuit again, run from a minimum of around $500,000 (\u00a3350,000) to more than $3m, the cost of a small film. So what films are really in with a chance in what is effectively the primary season for nominations? Julia Roberts will almost certainly get a best actress nomination for her role in Erin Brockovich, as may Ren\u00e9e Zellweger for Nurse Betty. Quills, directed by Philip Kaufman and starring Geoffrey Rush, Kate Winslet and Michael Caine, is highly tipped for various honours provided the subject matter of the Marquis de Sade does not make the 6,000 or so academy member voters too squeamish. Contenders The Perfect Storm must be a favourite, for special effects at least, and the Denzel Washington film Remember the Titans has its supporters. Entertainment Weekly has already flagged its list of ones to watch. They include Almost Famous, which has done well critically, if not at the box office. MGM have hopes for Michael Winterbottom's mining drama, The Claim. Miramax will be marshalling support for All the Pretty Horses and Bounce. New Line is pushing David Mamet's Hollywood satire, State and Main, with William H Macy and Sarah Jessica Parker. The Coen Brothers' chain gang comedy O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Kenneth Lonergan's film You Can Count On Me are both being touted as producing nomination-worthy performances. Among the others to have received a mention are Tom Hanks's yet-to-be-released Cast Away and Steven Soderbergh's film Traffic, which was based on the British television mini-series of the same name. Finding Forrester has Sean Connery also being tipped as a contender for his role as a reclusive author in Gus Van Sant's coming-of-age story about a black teenager in the south Bronx. And Britain's other hopes? Universal are trusting that Stephen Daldry, director of Billy Elliot, is this year's Sam Mendes, - the British theatre director who wins the hearts of the Academy members. The film has been heavily marketed here and would hope at least to be in the running. High Fidelity, based on Nick Hornby's book but set in the US rather than in London, has also been mentioned.

A parallel study by the standing medical advisory committee concluded: \"We are looking into the abyss.\" </p> <p>The problem is easily put: misuse of antibiotics in intensive farming and over-prescribing by doctors is leading the world back to pre-penicillin days. Huge advances achieved by antibiotics in the last 60 years against a host of diseases and infections are now threatened by revitalised multi-drug resistant organisms. </p> <p>Certainly more headway has been made than was achieved by the Swann committee, which called in 1969 for an over-arching expert committee to monitor the use of human and animal medicines. The committee never materialised. A sub-committee of the veterinary products committee was established, but when it asked in 1981 for funds to monitor the problem, not only was it refused by Tory ministers but the committee was abolished. </p> <p>Acutely aware of this history, the Lords committee is due to review progress. There is movement: an inter-departmental steering group; new guidance to doctors and patients on the danger of misusing antibiotics; new bans on six antibiotic animal growth promoters.

The UK was the only European member to oppose a 1996 ban, but all six bans in 1999 were supported by Labour. </p> <p>But much more needs doing. One-off campaigns achieve little, at best a momentary dip, when the Lords report spoke of up to 50% over-prescribing. Only a sustained campaign will turn this round. The promised expert committee is still not in place, 30 months after the last proposal and 31 years after Swann. The call for more antibiotics research has not been taken up by Wellcome or Medical Research Council grants. And the monitoring of animal antibiotics falls far short: 1999 figures not due until next year, no distinction between species. </p> <p>It has been left to the Soil Association to show that, despite growth promoter bans, vets continue to prescribe antibiotics in ever greater tonnage. Following Swann, tetracycline was banned as a growth promoter in 1969, when 19.5 tons was being used. A Soil Association report in 1998 calculated 350 tons were being prescribed for animal sickness 30 years later. Far from receding, the gaping abyss now looks even more threatening.</p>",

One-off campaigns achieve little, at best a momentary dip, when the Lords report spoke of up to 50% over-prescribing. Only a sustained campaign will turn this round. The promised expert committee is still not in place, 30 months after the last proposal and 31 years after Swann. The call for more antibiotics research has not been taken up by Wellcome or Medical Research Council grants. And the monitoring of animal antibiotics falls far short: 1999 figures not due until next year, no distinction between species. It has been left to the Soil Association to show that, despite growth promoter bans, vets continue to prescribe antibiotics in ever greater tonnage. Following Swann, tetracycline was banned as a growth promoter in 1969, when 19.5 tons was being used. A Soil Association report in 1998 calculated 350 tons were being prescribed for animal sickness 30 years later. Far from receding, the gaping abyss now looks even more threatening.",

      "body": "<p>An obscure Swiss textile firm, which turned round its ailing business by going green and inventing a biodegradable and compostable upholstery fabric, has won the Design Museum's \u00a340,000 prize for sustainability. </p> <p>Rohner Textil AG was a traditional mill, struggling to compete against low-cost producers in developing countries, when its managing director, Albin K\u00e4lin, decided to make environmental and social responsibility his selling point. The revolutionary fabric, Climatex Lifecycle, is made of a mix of wool from \"free range, humanely sheared\" New Zealand sheep and ramie, a moisture conducting fibre used by the Egyptians 4,000 years ago and now organically grown in the Philippines. </p> <p>The company has literally \"greened\" its old mill, in Balgach, by planting a grass roof to alleviate the steamy temperatures inside. Alternative health practitioners have been brought in to advise on ergonomics and stress management. In addition, the company runs an educational programme and has set up a profit sharing arrangement with its 30-strong workforce. </p> <p>It was this holistic approach that gave Rohner the edge in a high profile shortlist for the Design Sense award, which included the likes of architects Foster &amp; Partner's energy efficient design for the Reichstag, the German parliament, and BMW's recyclable C1 motorcycle. </p> <p>Entries were evaluated in terms of their environmental, commercial, social and aesthetic impact on current and future generations. The judges of the award for sustainable design, sponsored by metal producer Corus, said Rohner was a commercially successful example of how the notoriously dirty global textile industry could clean up its act. The Rufford Foundation, which puts up the prize money, believes Rohner could even become a model of best practice for textile companies in developing countries. </p> <p>Yet it was not long ago that the Swiss mill was just another instance of decline in a European textile industry. K\u00e4lin felt he had to do something dramatic.

      "bodyText": "An obscure Swiss textile firm, which turned round its ailing business by going green and inventing a biodegradable and compostable upholstery fabric, has won the Design Museum's \u00a340,000 prize for sustainability. Rohner Textil AG was a traditional mill, struggling to compete against low-cost producers in developing countries, when its managing director, Albin K\u00e4lin, decided to make environmental and social responsibility his selling point. The revolutionary fabric, Climatex Lifecycle, is made of a mix of wool from \"free range, humanely sheared\" New Zealand sheep and ramie, a moisture conducting fibre used by the Egyptians 4,000 years ago and now organically grown in the Philippines. The company has literally \"greened\" its old mill, in Balgach, by planting a grass roof to alleviate the steamy temperatures inside. Alternative health practitioners have been brought in to advise on ergonomics and stress management. In addition, the company runs an educational programme and has set up a profit sharing arrangement with its 30-strong workforce. It was this holistic approach that gave Rohner the edge in a high profile shortlist for the Design Sense award, which included the likes of architects Foster &amp; Partner's energy efficient design for the Reichstag, the German parliament, and BMW's recyclable C1 motorcycle. Entries were evaluated in terms of their environmental, commercial, social and aesthetic impact on current and future generations. The judges of the award for sustainable design, sponsored by metal producer Corus, said Rohner was a commercially successful example of how the notoriously dirty global textile industry could clean up its act. The Rufford Foundation, which puts up the prize money, believes Rohner could even become a model of best practice for textile companies in developing countries. Yet it was not long ago that the Swiss mill was just another instance of decline in a European textile industry. K\u00e4lin felt he had to do something dramatic. Instead of slashing his workforce, he introduced ecological accounting systems and invested 1% of annual turnover in environmental issues. Some adjustments were fairly straightforward, like collecting rainwater to use for the toilets. However, it took technicians eight years to develop the Climatex Lifecycle fabric, because of the difficulties of making a stretch fabric without synthetic materials. Only 16 dyes - 1% of all those available - were found to be completely biodegradable. Even so, this is enough for the fabric to be available in pretty much every colour, apart from black. According to Paul Thompson, director of the Design Museum, other companies could \"leapfrog over the worst excesses of 19th and 20th century production\" by following the Swiss example. \"This wasn't a new venture on a greenfield site,\" he says. \"They started with a historical building in a town centre and took a risk to add value to the product. It was a bold and adventurous move and the kind of thing we want the Design Sense award to encourage.\" \u0095 Further details: www.climatex.com",

Symbolically on Saturday, in the biggest demonstration Friends of the Earth has ever organised, 6,000 volunteers from 40 countries built a 500 metre-long sand bag barrier round the conference hall. The Dutch environment minister, Jan Pronk, who is also president of the conference, came out and placed the last of the 50,000 bags. That night the demonstrators celebrated their feat in a \"flood survival tent\". By Sunday, the good mood had evaporated and, while delegates, press and officials were inside the vast atrium of the Netherlands ministry of environment at Pronk's official welcome party, it was back to normal outside with riot police dispersing a crowd of demonstrators. And on Monday, to make sure it really was business as usual, the sand bag barrier had been removed to make way for the traffic. </p> <p><strong> That sinking feeling</strong><br> </p> <p> Inside the hangar in the conference hall, the major row is about \"sinks\". These are claims that if you plant trees or crops that take carbon out of the atmosphere it can be claimed as a credit to be counted against your emissions from burning fossil fuels. The US gets the flak for this loophole, but the Australians are the most shameless exponents, claiming anything that grows more than 15cm high can be counted as a sink. The largest cafe in use in the climate conference sports not flowers on the table but buckets of grass, they are labelled \"Australian sinks\". </p> <p><strong> Get the message?</strong><br> </p> <p> The <a href=\"http://www.climatevoice.org\">www.climatevoice.org</a> website started an ambitious plan on August 22 to send messages to world leaders demanding they use the Hague summit to tackle climate change. They had an ambitious target of 10m in three months. On Monday, 93 heads of state, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, had received a total of 11m messages. </p> <p><strong> Low budget</strong><br> </p> <p> The dominate players at the Hague are the US and EU. The people who will get wiped out first in Africa and low-lying islands hardly have a voice. It's all to do with economics. The US have 150 delegates at the luxury Bel Air Hotel. Mozambique have three delegates - they are sharing a dormitory in the Hague youth hostel with a group of Japanese students on vacation.</p>",

The Dutch environment minister, Jan Pronk, who is also president of the conference, came out and placed the last of the 50,000 bags. That night the demonstrators celebrated their feat in a \"flood survival tent\". By Sunday, the good mood had evaporated and, while delegates, press and officials were inside the vast atrium of the Netherlands ministry of environment at Pronk's official welcome party, it was back to normal outside with riot police dispersing a crowd of demonstrators. And on Monday, to make sure it really was business as usual, the sand bag barrier had been removed to make way for the traffic. That sinking feeling Inside the hangar in the conference hall, the major row is about \"sinks\". These are claims that if you plant trees or crops that take carbon out of the atmosphere it can be claimed as a credit to be counted against your emissions from burning fossil fuels. The US gets the flak for this loophole, but the Australians are the most shameless exponents, claiming anything that grows more than 15cm high can be counted as a sink. The largest cafe in use in the climate conference sports not flowers on the table but buckets of grass, they are labelled \"Australian sinks\". Get the message? The www.climatevoice.org website started an ambitious plan on August 22 to send messages to world leaders demanding they use the Hague summit to tackle climate change. They had an ambitious target of 10m in three months. On Monday, 93 heads of state, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, had received a total of 11m messages. Low budget The dominate players at the Hague are the US and EU. The people who will get wiped out first in Africa and low-lying islands hardly have a voice. It's all to do with economics. The US have 150 delegates at the luxury Bel Air Hotel. Mozambique have three delegates - they are sharing a dormitory in the Hague youth hostel with a group of Japanese students on vacation.",

      "body": "<p>It is 41 years since Alec Jenner was sitting in a Sheffield hospital canteen, reading in the Daily Mirror how a circus trainer was using a drug to sedate his tigers. \"Hey, this could work on the people of Sheffield,\" he joked to his colleagues. </p> <p>But the ambitious young psychiatrist saw in the story more than material for a wisecrack; he'd spotted an opportunity to further his career. He wrote to Swiss pharmaceutical company Hoffmann La Roche, suggesting the drug could relieve anxiety in humans and offering to carry out trials on patients. The company agreed and, after Jenner and his colleagues' research yielded positive results, Roche developed Valium. </p> <p>The drug was launched on to the global market in 1963. Over the next 40 years, Valium and similar tranquillisers called benzodiazepines became legendary for their immediate relief of anxiety and depression for millions across the world. </p> <p>Jenner, now 72 and retired, should therefore perhaps be glowing with pride in his farmhouse near Sheffield, after playing his part in the creation of the drug, known affectionately as \"mother's little helper\". But, over the past 20 years, he has witnessed Roche and other benzodiazepine manufacturers feeling the wrath of thousands of users, complaining of addiction and brain damage they claim has been caused by long-term use of the drugs. </p> <p>In 1986, 17,000 people brought a group action against benzodiazepine makers Wyeth, Roche and Upjohn. Although the action collapsed in 1994, when the legal aid board stopped paying legal fees that had already reached \u00a335m, the sense of injustice felt by the victims is as strong as ever. At a \"beat the benzos\" conference earlier this month, calls were renewed for compensation for benzodiazepine victims and a full inquiry into how the drugs were prescribed, despite their having been listed as drugs of \"dependence\" by the World Health Organisation and the British Medical Journal as early as the 60s. </p> <p>In fact, it took until 1988 - two years after the group action launch - for the committee of safety of medicines to recognise benzodiazepine dependence and to introduce guidelines specifying that the drugs should not be prescribed for more than four weeks. </p> <p>Jenner admits that when he carried out his early trials, he did not even consider the possibility of dependency problems - for which he is left feeling \"extremely na\u00efve\". He says: \"When I was researching the drug, we just thought of the advances this new drug could make. In the late 50s, the main treatment for anxiety was the barbiturate drugs, which were a lot more dangerous. When I was an ambitious doctor, I did not even think of Valium's addictive potential - although I now wish I had.\" </p> <p>Jenner admits that research on long-term effects of medication is not a cosy fit with the profit-making plans of pharmaceutical companies. \"Long-term trials are very expensive and difficult to arrange,\" he says. \"You cannot take this out of the equation in assessing what happened with benzodiazepines. </p> <p>\"And I would have been surprised if Roche had asked me to do long-term trials of Valium. The company would have been anxious to get it on the market. This is where you can be critical of the drug companies - but it is the system in which they work.\" </p> <p>After his early pioneering trials, Jenner did little further work for Roche. But, in 1990, he received a letter from the company's solicitors asking him to give his scientific opinion on the files of dozens of the group action Valium users complaining of addiction and memory loss, epileptic fits, vision problems, mood swings and extensive cognitive deficits. His assessment was that, generically, the users' problems were as likely to be due to \"addictive personalities\" and \"neurotic\" or \"pre-morbid\" diagnoses as Valium addiction and damage. </p> <p>Roche used Jenner's analysis in its defence. A company spokesman says its benzodiazepines have, since launch, been fully researched and kept under constant review. \"They have come to play an essential role in modern clinical practice, not only in the treatment of sleep and anxiety disorders but in a wide variety of psychiatric and medical uses.\" The litigation had been \"misguided and bound to fail\". </p> <p>Jenner says now: \"A lot of files I examined were those of people who have what I call 'problems of living' and who are searching for explanations of why they have such problems. I have sympathy for the people involved, some of whom may have a case. But the issue for me was to demonstrate scientifically whether their complaints were because of the effects of Valium. This was not the case. And, in legal cases, the benefit of the doubt is always with the accused. </p> <p>\"Having said this, much of the research is contradictory and we are not certain of very much in psychiatry. Allegations of damage could turn out to be true - in the same way as we did not originally think of the possibilities of addiction but now recognise this to be so.\" </p> <p>Jenner agreed to talk to the Guardian because he believes in open discussion about psychiatry and its drugs. His philosophy was demonstrated by him becoming founding editor in 1986 of Asylum - A Magazine for Democratic Psychiatry, which questions traditional psychiatric practice and continues the debate about benzodiazepines - particularly raising concerns about the high levels of the drugs given to patients in secure psychiatric units. </p> <p>And despite Jenner's view that the drug companies have no case to answer, he still recognises some validity in calls for a public inquiry. \"Such an inquiry might find something I have missed,\" he says. \"It might satisfy people who think that something has been hidden in the whole story about benzodiazepines.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Asylum is published quarterly by Handsell Publishing (01452-380319)</p>",

      "body": "<p>It has been called the first job creation scheme. Now, it is about to spawn a second one. With \u00a3750,000 public funding, work will next month begin on reopening a labyrinth of tunnels under Liverpool, created by a local philanthropist to provide work for men returning from the Napoleonic wars. Once derided, but long forgotten, the tunnels are poised to become a unique visitor attraction for the city. </p> <p>The extraordinary maze of tunnels runs through the sandstone of Edge Hill, once a village just outside what is now Liverpool's city centre. Nobody knows how extensive they are - though they include a dining hall and, reputedly, complete houses - and nobody quite understands why tobacco millionaire Joseph Williamson spent his entire fortune on digging the network. </p> <p>Local historians know only that Williamson had one tunnel built so that he and his wife could stay dry while walking to church; that he entertained radical friends to a subterranean banquet; and that he spent the last days of his life in an underground suite of rooms. </p> <p>But former seaman and labourer Gabriel Muies, driving force behind the Joseph Williamson Society and the one-man impetus for the project which will open them up, has his own answer. \"This was the world's first job creation scheme,\" he says. \"The pyramids were built by slaves, but Williamson paid the men who were coming back from the Napoleonic wars to create these tunnels, and he gave them back their dignity.\" </p> <p>Today, the best route into the labyrinth is through the derelict lord mayor's stables, a Georgian complex of stabling and housing which is to become a visitor centre for the tunnels. In one corner of the complex, a graceful brick arch leads into a massive cavern. Old butter churns and wooden wheels lie around - paraphernalia of a long-forgotten world which will eventually become an on-site museum. </p> <p>In the gloom at the back of the cavern, further arches lead to tunnels into the hill. Visitors can scramble through a hole to see a huge chamber above, tunnels running off to the left and towards the underground banqueting hall, and masons' chisel marks everywhere on the hand-hewn walls. Yet this narrow space is the apex of a massive tunnel, largely filled with some 12 metres (about 40 feet) of domestic ash and landfill from decades when the city used the tunnels as a dump. </p> <p>Muies points out that Williamson, over the 20 years or so he paid men to build the elaborate tunnels, was also keeping alive their masonry, joinery and bricklaying skills. One half-finished tunnel marks the point where men employed by the great railway engineer Robert Stephenson tunnelled into a gang of Williamson's diggers. Stephenson promptly employed them. </p> <p>Muies's own involvement with the tunnels goes back over half a century, when he used to fill a bag with scavenged coals so that he and his grandmother could have a fire at the weekend at their Toxteth home. \"I'd go into the railway tunnels, and when the trains rattled through pieces of coal would fall off,\" he recalls. \"But when the railwaymen spotted us, they would shout: 'Get out, or the Mad Mole of Edge Hill will get you!' The shouting echoed down the tunnels, and I used to pick up my bag and run like hell.\" </p> <p>Like most people in Liverpool, Muies believed that the story of the Mad Mole's tunnels was a myth. He only re-encountered the tale many years later, as a parent governor concerned about possible structural defects at his son's school. The school turned out to be next door to the remains of Williamson's mansion. </p> <p>Muies recounted the tales and was ribbed. When the parent governors adjourned to the pub, one roared, \"Get a drink for the Mad Mole, him and his tunnels!\" But one of the older regulars overheard, and commented that he had played in the tunnels as a child. Muies bought him a drink and got into conversation, the man remembering the one entrance that had not been filled in. Next time Muies visited the pub, the man had with him a a friend who remembered that there was another entrance through the lord mayor's stables. </p> <p>For 15 years, Muies has been battling against red tape to gain entrance to the tunnels and preserve them. City council officers were quick to deny their existence: like other local landowners, they have had difficulty with the idea that the land may be unstable. Indeed, one Victorian newspaper called the tunnels \"a gigantic nuisance\" - and that has been the line taken by those in authority for over a century. </p> <p>As Muies has pieced together the story through books, maps and diagrams gathering dust in the city's archives, a fascinating picture has emerged. When men returning from the Napoleonic wars begged Williamson for work, he paid them to clean up his fields, then to build a wall around his estate. When those projects were finished, and the men were desperate for more pay, he told them to dig a tunnel into the hill on which his mansion was built. </p> <p>\"Joseph Williamson arrived in Liverpool penniless as an 11-year old, and he died penniless - all he had was his mansion,\" says Muies. \"This man was no madman: he was Liverpool's greatest benefactor.\" </p> <p>Once he had rediscovered the tunnels, Muies pleaded with the council to develop them. Instead, the authority sold the lord mayor's stables and surrounding land, with permission to demolish the buildings. Muies went straight to the developer,Seymour Properties, and explained the story. \"I told them that this is a little gem,\" he says. \"They agreed it is a unique piece of Liverpool's history.\" </p> <p>A deal was struck: Seymour gave 90% of the site to the Joseph Williamson Society, together with a \u00a3200,000 donation, covering the costs by developing the remaining part, which was built on in the 30s. Muies then used the initial donation to secure a total \u00a3750,000 funding from the Granby Toxteth partnership, the Parks partnership and the European \"objective 1\" programme for Merseyside, designed to create jobs in deprived areas. </p> <p>He also plans to apply for further objective 1 funding over the next five years. His argument is simple: \"I'm unemployed, I fit your criteria, and I'm creating jobs not only for myself but for other local people too.\" </p> <p>Work is scheduled to start on the site within the next few weeks, with the first phase due to open to the public by next Easter. The scheme will eventually include the tunnels (with disabled access), a restaurant and marquee; children's entertainment, including a maypole and live theatre; and a range of heritage businesses, from horse-drawn taxicabs to traditional crafts. The signs are that local interest is strong: a heritage weekend in 1998, supported by the Guardian, drew 2,500 people. </p> <p>Muies is fast turning into the stuff of local legend himself. When he drinks in The Empress, his local in Toxteth and the old watering hole of Ringo Starr's parents, they call him \"the king of Liverpool's underworld\". When a rumour went round town that he was removing chains from the tunnels, and that there was some connection with Liverpool's slaving history, he snorted: \"Chains? There were no chains.

      "body": "<p>Care in the community for mentally ill people may seem like a modern idea, but in fact it goes back to the Victorian era and a hospital chaplain called Henry Hawkins. As early as the 1870s, he was proposing the creation of \"half-way houses between the asylum and the world\" and calling for support for discharged patients to enable them to resume, in his phrase, \"life's ordinary associations\". </p> <p>Hawkins went on to found an organisation with an army of volunteers who arranged places in family homes for those convalescing after a spell in an asylum. It then offered them continuing practical assistance, including help finding a job. </p> <p>Today, that organisation is holding a conference to mark its 121st anniversary. Maca, the Mental After Care Association, has grown into a thriving voluntary organisation with 800 paid members of staff who last year helped more than 30,000 people. Its clients range from former psychiatric in-patients with severe mental problems, and people with personality disorders, to those who need less intervention but rely on smaller projects like drop-in centres to prevent them relapsing. </p> <p>Even though mental health care now is unrecognisable from the old asylum days, Maca holds on to its vision of helping people in the community achieve the basics like a roof over their head and gainful employment. Its chief executive, Gil Hitchon, insists that the challenge remains as great as when Hawkins first defined his mission at Colney Hatch asylum (later renamed Friern Barnet hospital) in north London). \"The original goals remain relevant as we often still don't offer people those basic requirements for leading a fulfilling life,\" says Hitchon. </p> <p>Hitchon believes Hawkins was on the right track with his emphasis on helping mentally ill people as individuals, not an amorphous group. The churchman noted early on that many convalescent patients left asylums only to return to \"squalor and wretchedness\", hampering their recovery. He was also anxious about the poor employment prospects they faced. In 1871, he wrote in the Journal of Mental Science (later the British Journal of Psychiatry) that, without work, patients would soon be back in the workhouse or, worse, finish \"by an uncontrollable act of violence their miserable lives\". </p> <p>Eight years later, he wrote a second article on \"after-care\", expanding on his original ideas and proposing the formation of an association to help female ex-patients. The suggestion found ready support among philanthropists and psychiatrists who felt that the asylum system, set in train by the 1845 Lunacy Act, had laid the foundations for a segregated society. </p> <p>In 1879, Hawkins called a meeting of like-minded people and the upshot was the formation of The After-Care Association for Poor and Friendless Female Convalescents on Leaving Asylums for the Insane. Care in the community had its first powerful and organised advocate. </p> <p>Although the high profile figures in that early organisation were men, it was women volunteers - generally the well-heeled wives of psychiatrists, philanthropists and reformers - who were the linchpin from the outset. Hawkins was made the association's first secretary but, once he had ensured his ideas had taken hold, seemed happy to take a back seat. He saw it expand its remit to take in men, but in later years suffered ill health and died in 1904. So he never lived to see the huge growth of his organisation's work during the first world war, when it was called on to care for shell-shocked soldiers. </p> <p>The second world war saw another burst of activity, as Maca helped relocate long-term mental hospital patients to residential care homes to make way for injured soldiers. The experiment was an immediate success and the organisation's annual report in 1943 noted: \"We think that this method of caring for suitable chronic patients is worth further exploration and development.\" </p> <p>And develop it they did, until, by the 80s, Maca was established as one of the most experienced providers of residential care for people with mental health needs. The 1990 NHS and Community Care Act prompted further diversification and the association has doubled its staff in the past four years. </p> <p>\"People underestimate the amount we do,\" says Hitchon. \"We offer everything from advocacy services and assertive outreach with difficult to engage people, to support in people's homes, employment training and work schemes. We have moved into forensic services for people in contact with the criminal justice system - and then there's the helplines, the respite for carers, the supported housing.\" </p> <p>Maca is content to be a service provider, not a campaigning organisation. But its \"let's just get on with the job\" approach means that some may have overlooked its pioneering work in the past, as well as its vital role today. As Hitchon sums it up: \"As far as we're concerned, community care is the only model. And it has been from day one.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Care in the community for mentally ill people may seem like a modern idea, but in fact it goes back to the Victorian era and a hospital chaplain called Henry Hawkins. As early as the 1870s, he was proposing the creation of \"half-way houses between the asylum and the world\" and calling for support for discharged patients to enable them to resume, in his phrase, \"life's ordinary associations\". Hawkins went on to found an organisation with an army of volunteers who arranged places in family homes for those convalescing after a spell in an asylum. It then offered them continuing practical assistance, including help finding a job. Today, that organisation is holding a conference to mark its 121st anniversary. Maca, the Mental After Care Association, has grown into a thriving voluntary organisation with 800 paid members of staff who last year helped more than 30,000 people. Its clients range from former psychiatric in-patients with severe mental problems, and people with personality disorders, to those who need less intervention but rely on smaller projects like drop-in centres to prevent them relapsing. Even though mental health care now is unrecognisable from the old asylum days, Maca holds on to its vision of helping people in the community achieve the basics like a roof over their head and gainful employment. Its chief executive, Gil Hitchon, insists that the challenge remains as great as when Hawkins first defined his mission at Colney Hatch asylum (later renamed Friern Barnet hospital) in north London). \"The original goals remain relevant as we often still don't offer people those basic requirements for leading a fulfilling life,\" says Hitchon. Hitchon believes Hawkins was on the right track with his emphasis on helping mentally ill people as individuals, not an amorphous group. The churchman noted early on that many convalescent patients left asylums only to return to \"squalor and wretchedness\", hampering their recovery. He was also anxious about the poor employment prospects they faced. In 1871, he wrote in the Journal of Mental Science (later the British Journal of Psychiatry) that, without work, patients would soon be back in the workhouse or, worse, finish \"by an uncontrollable act of violence their miserable lives\". Eight years later, he wrote a second article on \"after-care\", expanding on his original ideas and proposing the formation of an association to help female ex-patients. The suggestion found ready support among philanthropists and psychiatrists who felt that the asylum system, set in train by the 1845 Lunacy Act, had laid the foundations for a segregated society. In 1879, Hawkins called a meeting of like-minded people and the upshot was the formation of The After-Care Association for Poor and Friendless Female Convalescents on Leaving Asylums for the Insane. Care in the community had its first powerful and organised advocate. Although the high profile figures in that early organisation were men, it was women volunteers - generally the well-heeled wives of psychiatrists, philanthropists and reformers - who were the linchpin from the outset. Hawkins was made the association's first secretary but, once he had ensured his ideas had taken hold, seemed happy to take a back seat. He saw it expand its remit to take in men, but in later years suffered ill health and died in 1904. So he never lived to see the huge growth of his organisation's work during the first world war, when it was called on to care for shell-shocked soldiers. The second world war saw another burst of activity, as Maca helped relocate long-term mental hospital patients to residential care homes to make way for injured soldiers. The experiment was an immediate success and the organisation's annual report in 1943 noted: \"We think that this method of caring for suitable chronic patients is worth further exploration and development.\" And develop it they did, until, by the 80s, Maca was established as one of the most experienced providers of residential care for people with mental health needs. The 1990 NHS and Community Care Act prompted further diversification and the association has doubled its staff in the past four years. \"People underestimate the amount we do,\" says Hitchon. \"We offer everything from advocacy services and assertive outreach with difficult to engage people, to support in people's homes, employment training and work schemes. We have moved into forensic services for people in contact with the criminal justice system - and then there's the helplines, the respite for carers, the supported housing.\" Maca is content to be a service provider, not a campaigning organisation. But its \"let's just get on with the job\" approach means that some may have overlooked its pioneering work in the past, as well as its vital role today. As Hitchon sums it up: \"As far as we're concerned, community care is the only model. And it has been from day one.\"",

      "bodyText": "British Telecom has resurrected plans to enter the entertainment business, claiming dial-up game shows and comedy will \"set it apart\" from its rivals. A high-level former Hollywood executive has been hired to oversee the project with plans to launch the service by the middle of next year. BT chiefs have told MediaGuardian.co.uk that they will broadcast their own game show and comedy programmes on the BTopenworld broadband service. John Raczka, head of content at BTopenworld, said: \"Broadband will be a very big business for BT. These original productions will add some unique flavouring that our competitors will not have.\" Discussions are already taking place with US film studios and UK production companies about co-funding the 15-minute shows. The radical initiative will see programmes broadcast down high-speed internet connections onto a customer's computer. But ultimately the company plans to deliver the programmes to TV sets. Chevy Chase fans will be pleased that BT intends to launch a Saturday Night Live-style sketch show, and the game show programmes may involve interactive elements. \"We want it to be unique, unlike what we see on TV. But it must not be expensive, so we will pool our resources alongside other production companies and telecoms operators,\" added Mr Raczka. Revenues will be generated by syndicating the productions around the world, and by selling successful game show or comedy formats to TV networks. BT sees its ambitious programme as the key to converting customers from slow-moving narrowband internet services onto multi-purpose broadband lines. BT's production plans give an inkling of what is on the way when the government lets the group broadcast entertainment programmes down its lines from January 2001. The previous Conservative administration had banned BT from moving into programming in order to encourage cable operators to build networks. Mr Raczka said: \"From a platform perspective, we plan to move broadband from PC to TV in the next 18 months. And as for broadcasting BBC and ITV over BT lines, it depends on who is bedfellows with whom. Everyone is giving it serious thought.\"",

One of the most fundamental is about scale. </p> <p>In the 20th century, energy was big business - huge power stations and mega-dams using vast transmissions networks to distribute electricity to the masses. Economies of scale meant larger power stations created lower costs per unit of fuel burnt and hence increased revenue. But big projects created big environmental problems: radiation from Chernobyl in Ukraine, displacement of populations from the Narmada dam in central India, acid rain from coal-fired power stations in Europe. The most serious environmental problem so far is, of course, climate change and the capital invested in fossil fuel power stations is one of the factors that has prevented a much swifter response to the threat of climate change. The fossil fuel industries successfully lobbied against action to cut greenhouse gases. </p> <p>Climate change is now recognised in all parts of the world as a genuine threat, with the possible exception of Austin, Texas. Evidence is mounting and, despite the desperate search for loopholes in the Kyoto protocol now under way in the Hague, the energy sector is beginning to look for low-carbon options. There has been an exodus of energy companies from the American anti-Kyoto lobbying group Global Climate Coalition. Boardrooms are starting to talk about clean fuels. </p> <p>But the real corporate choice is going to be between big and small. There are \"big\" low-carbon options: hydroelectric dams, tidal barrages and nuclear power among them - means of generating electricity without major emissions of carbon into the atmosphere. But these require huge capital investment and in a liberalised, more competitive energy market, they are risky. </p> <p>Global support for mega-dam projects took a blow last week with the first report of the world commission on dams. It recommended much stricter criteria for approving projects, including more local consultation and better assessments of environmental consequences. The first casualty could be the Ilisu dam in Turkey, which is dependent on export credit guarantees, not least from the UK, to go ahead. The Chinese are building the Three Gorges dam, but only a totalitarian regime could possibly impose such a project on its population in the modern age. </p> <p>The most grandiose low-carbon option of all has also become visible in recent weeks. The Royal Academy of Engineers recommended the UK needed to build new nuclear power stations to meet climate obligations. The first application for a new nuclear power station in western Europe since the 1980s was made in Finland last week. Nuclear power received a great deal of public subsidy over decades to establish the industry, but now it is largely in the private sector, major investors have been impossible to find. Scientists are still no nearer solving the problem of waste disposal than when Windscale was first opened and the environmental risks involved would push the boundaries of public acceptability. </p> <p>The expansion of hydro and nuclear power would, regardless of environmental effects, lock us into another straitjacket when the lesson we should learn is that diversity and flexibility are virtues in energy supply. </p> <p>The future is smaller. This trend has already started with the introduction of the gas turbine, which generates less electricity than traditional thermal power stations. Generators powered by gas are still large but are more flexible because they can be sited nearer electricity customers; they can also be used to produce combined heat and power (CHP) for industrial sites, radically cutting fuel costs. </p> <p>The most exciting technological advances in energy, as in communications, electronics and biology, are micro in scale. </p> <p>Solar panels, wind turbines, fuel cells and domestic boilers which generate electricity in the home as well as heat, are all developing rapidly and do not require the sort of capital investment that old-style mega power stations did. Until the liberalisation of the energy sector only lone voices such as Amory Lovins in the United States or Walt Patterson in the UK would contemplate such a transformation. Now the big companies are getting in on the act. </p> <p>BP and Shell are moving into the solar market. Offshore wind turbines are being built in northern Europe and promoted by major engineering companies such as AMEC. BG Group, part of the old British Gas, is developing new micro-CHP boilers which will produce electricity and heat in the home. ABB, a major power engineering company, has pledged to move its business into wind turbines and fuel cells. Nearly all the major motor manufacturers in the world are developing vehicles based on fuel cells which convert hydrogen into electric power, with an exhaust gas of water vapour. Last week, the chairman of BMW urged the UK government to promote the use of hydrogen as a fuel. </p> <p>While they will produce less energy per installation, \"micro-power\" plants could improve overall efficiencies in the system as they do not require high voltage transmission lines to link supply to demand. This will make the technologies particularly valuable in the developing world, where the grids that do exist are extremely unreliable and most people still do not have access to electricity. </p> <p> Chris Hewett is senior research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research. c.hewett@ippr.org.uk</p>",

Solar panels, wind turbines, fuel cells and domestic boilers which generate electricity in the home as well as heat, are all developing rapidly and do not require the sort of capital investment that old-style mega power stations did. Until the liberalisation of the energy sector only lone voices such as Amory Lovins in the United States or Walt Patterson in the UK would contemplate such a transformation. Now the big companies are getting in on the act. BP and Shell are moving into the solar market. Offshore wind turbines are being built in northern Europe and promoted by major engineering companies such as AMEC. BG Group, part of the old British Gas, is developing new micro-CHP boilers which will produce electricity and heat in the home. ABB, a major power engineering company, has pledged to move its business into wind turbines and fuel cells. Nearly all the major motor manufacturers in the world are developing vehicles based on fuel cells which convert hydrogen into electric power, with an exhaust gas of water vapour. Last week, the chairman of BMW urged the UK government to promote the use of hydrogen as a fuel. While they will produce less energy per installation, \"micro-power\" plants could improve overall efficiencies in the system as they do not require high voltage transmission lines to link supply to demand. This will make the technologies particularly valuable in the developing world, where the grids that do exist are extremely unreliable and most people still do not have access to electricity.

The decision to discharge the jury on the second day of the trial will cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds, the lord chancellor's department said last night. David Clarke, Liverpool's most senior judge, abandoned the proceedings after seeing the programme in which a Merseyside woman claimed she had been sexually abused by her stepfather in the 1970s. Judge Clarke, the recorder of Liverpool, told the jury there were too many similarities between the cases for the 54-year-old defendant to receive a fair trial and remanded him on bail to await re-trial next year. The development could open the way for defence lawyers to use similar arguments to get the jury dismissed if media coverage of a case echoes their own. The defendant had denied three charges of indecently assaulting his stepdaughter in the early 1970s beginning when she was seven and four offences of raping her when she was 15. He also denied two offences of indecently assaulting his 12-year-old daughter in the 1980s. The BBC2 programme claimed a 71-year-old pensioner, named only as Stanley, regularly raped his three stepdaughters in Birkenhead, Merseyside, but was not on the Sex Offenders' Register.

Pointing out that the number of business in the north-west of England with internet access had risen from 55% last year to 84% this year, Mr Byers said, however, that proportions trading online varied from 33% in Greater London to just 24% in the south-west. Redstone's chief executive, Graham Cove, said, meanwhile, the firm is planning to steal a march on its bigger rivals in the struggle to provide broadband internet services for the UK's army of small businesses by offering them faster and more cheaply. Mr Cove has laid plans to by pass the protracted dispute between BT and telecoms watchdog Oftel over \"unbundling\" the local loop - allowing competitors access to local exchanges - by July next year. Redstone is to build its own roadside cabinets - one metre square steel boxes - outside BT's local exchanges and use them to house ADSL (asymmetrical digital subscriber line) equipment in an effort to capture 20% of Britain's 3m small and medium-sized firms. Mr Cove said that BT had agreed to allow 600 external links to local exchanges from July but only 190 inside these exchanges and Redstone had applied for 425 sites, with hopes of winning most of these. \"We don't get to know the answer until the end of February but our assumption is that we will get access to the vast majority of them,\" he said.

If this ends in political disaster, it will be Gordon Brown's own.</p> <p>Robert Kiley, the man brought in to rescue London Transport, flew back to New York last night in grim mood. Finally, after an absurd display of government truculence, he has eventually been given the contract papers he needs to peruse over the next week. In New York he is meeting top bankers to draw up an alternative plan for financing the vast new investment needed. The question is, when he returns will the ministers and especially the chancellor, be ready to listen? Kiley is not playing politics here, he is not Ken Livingstone's creature. He is a train man who has rescued both the Boston and the New York subway systems. He knows more than anyone about running subways, more even than the clever chancellor and other ministers. Many London MPs are alarmed, but worry that any public intervention by them will only make the obstinate dig their heels in harder.</p> <p>Kiley has surveyed the tube management and plant with horror. He has toured control rooms still held together with devices he's only seen in transport museums, and wonders where the millions poured down the tube over the years have gone. He has looked at the through-put of trains and asks why there are so few. He promises that within 18 months, even before renewing track and signalling, he can make the existing system work far better. Professor Tony Travers of the LSE says it can be done: on the Northern line only 19 trains an hour run yet they can run at one a minute (40 an hour in 1912). As for the London Underground managers, if they were eager to sign their own death warrants, then they just did it flamboyantly this week by announcing the closure of the tube on New Year's Eve, cancelling the London firework display when every British city and every capital city plans global celebrations.</p> <p>These incompetents now negotiate the \"best and final\" offers for the unbreakable 30-year private contracts. Kiley has met the bidders and fears those conducting these deals are ill-equipped innocents. Take the bid for the Victoria, Bakerloo and Central lines: they only promise to renew the rails and signals for one of those lines by the very end of their first seven years. The companies will put their first energies into smartening up stations which yield quick profits with rent from new shops and property deals.</p> <p>But passengers just want trains. What of contracts that remove the ATP safety system to install cheaper moving block systems that have failed elsewhere? The tube is vastly over-manned, mainly with bureaucrats, 20% of whom will have to go. But the contracts cherrypick all the useful engineers and maintenance workers, leaving the publicly owned part still weighed down with the expense and difficulty of shedding large numbers. Kiley fears the structure of the PPP itself is flawed. How can he run it when he cannot order private depots to send out his trains? In the event of a row with them some morning, taking them to arbitration several weeks later will not keep his trains running.</p> <p>All this is fixable. There is still time - just. The national audit office will assess the calculations comparing the PPP's value for money with a public sector alternative. They say they will seek out any weaselly assumptions that so often compare the very best of private outcomes with the very worst of public results. The health and safety executive also has to approve the PPP: after the Railtrack experience, will they be more sceptical? Maybe one of these will apply the brakes and get everyone off the hook.</p> <p>Astonishingly, neither the chancellor nor anyone from the Treasury has yet met Kiley. He has met no-one above transport minister level. On high the official line remains that PPP has to stay. Between gritted teeth, they point out that Kiley took on the job accepting the PPP. Yes, there could be a bit of modification - but it must be PPP. Backing down is hard after Dobson went to his death for it, Prescott laid his old Labour heart on the rails for it, Macdonald was appointed handcuffed to it and Labour MPs voted for it. No turning back is still the word. Why?</p> <p>Ken Livingstone. Government hatred blinds them to all else. It also delivers them straight into his cunning hands. Kiley arrived at Livingstone's invitation and was taken under the mayor's wing, so instead of calling him into the highest offices for talks, they seethed and accused him of being \"Livingstone's man\". Or, more patronisingly, Livingstone's fall guy whom the old sorcerer will hang out to dry if anything goes wrong. London MPs are torn between their hatred of Livingstone and their wise fear of pushing PPP against the voters' will.</p> <p>The politics of all this is clear. When London voted against PPP, rightly or wrongly Labour lost the argument. After Hatfield and the Railtrack meltdown, it was in ruins as a recent Mori poll shows. Even if PPP is the best technical solution, politically it is a dead duck. Carrying on as if nothing has changed is unthinkable madness. Those who wish the Labour party well - especially Labour ministers and MPs - cannot stand by and let it happen. If it goes ahead with Kiley still proclaiming the system badly flawed, then every accident or glitch will be the government's fault, with Livingstone smiling like a tiger. Kiley is bemused by tribal British politics but knows a lot of faces have to be saved: he can do that if they will let him. Livingstone promises to agree whatever system Kiley thinks will work best. Now if Kiley comes up with a modified scheme he thinks better, the question is whether the government can swallow a little pride. Politically all that matters for Labour is that Kiley, Livingstone, Prescott and Brown all end up agreeing and London has a transport system that is no longer the worst in Europe.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Take the bid for the Victoria, Bakerloo and Central lines: they only promise to renew the rails and signals for one of those lines by the very end of their first seven years. The companies will put their first energies into smartening up stations which yield quick profits with rent from new shops and property deals. But passengers just want trains. What of contracts that remove the ATP safety system to install cheaper moving block systems that have failed elsewhere? The tube is vastly over-manned, mainly with bureaucrats, 20% of whom will have to go. But the contracts cherrypick all the useful engineers and maintenance workers, leaving the publicly owned part still weighed down with the expense and difficulty of shedding large numbers. Kiley fears the structure of the PPP itself is flawed. How can he run it when he cannot order private depots to send out his trains? In the event of a row with them some morning, taking them to arbitration several weeks later will not keep his trains running. All this is fixable. There is still time - just. The national audit office will assess the calculations comparing the PPP's value for money with a public sector alternative. They say they will seek out any weaselly assumptions that so often compare the very best of private outcomes with the very worst of public results. The health and safety executive also has to approve the PPP: after the Railtrack experience, will they be more sceptical? Maybe one of these will apply the brakes and get everyone off the hook. Astonishingly, neither the chancellor nor anyone from the Treasury has yet met Kiley. He has met no-one above transport minister level. On high the official line remains that PPP has to stay. Between gritted teeth, they point out that Kiley took on the job accepting the PPP. Yes, there could be a bit of modification - but it must be PPP. Backing down is hard after Dobson went to his death for it, Prescott laid his old Labour heart on the rails for it, Macdonald was appointed handcuffed to it and Labour MPs voted for it. No turning back is still the word. Why? Ken Livingstone. Government hatred blinds them to all else. It also delivers them straight into his cunning hands. Kiley arrived at Livingstone's invitation and was taken under the mayor's wing, so instead of calling him into the highest offices for talks, they seethed and accused him of being \"Livingstone's man\". Or, more patronisingly, Livingstone's fall guy whom the old sorcerer will hang out to dry if anything goes wrong. London MPs are torn between their hatred of Livingstone and their wise fear of pushing PPP against the voters' will. The politics of all this is clear. When London voted against PPP, rightly or wrongly Labour lost the argument. After Hatfield and the Railtrack meltdown, it was in ruins as a recent Mori poll shows. Even if PPP is the best technical solution, politically it is a dead duck. Carrying on as if nothing has changed is unthinkable madness. Those who wish the Labour party well - especially Labour ministers and MPs - cannot stand by and let it happen. If it goes ahead with Kiley still proclaiming the system badly flawed, then every accident or glitch will be the government's fault, with Livingstone smiling like a tiger. Kiley is bemused by tribal British politics but knows a lot of faces have to be saved: he can do that if they will let him. Livingstone promises to agree whatever system Kiley thinks will work best. Now if Kiley comes up with a modified scheme he thinks better, the question is whether the government can swallow a little pride. Politically all that matters for Labour is that Kiley, Livingstone, Prescott and Brown all end up agreeing and London has a transport system that is no longer the worst in Europe. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

It is easy to see why the newspaper should take this view. Yesterday was the fifth time in 10 months that Mr Putin and Mr Blair were having a tete-a-tete. A fortnight before Mr Putin was elected in March, the Blairs showed up in his home town of St Peters burg for a night at the opera. Once he was elected, Mr Putin made Downing Street his first foreign port of call. Briefing Russian journalists on the visit this week, the Russian ambassador in London said that the personal chemistry between Mr Blair and Mr Putin was such that relations between Britain and Russia were now the best ever. Mr Putin said of Mr Blair yesterday: \"He's very well-informed and pleasant - I've come to the conclusion that our meetings tend to be very informal, frank, and friendly.\" Mr Blair said of Mr Putin: \"He is someone who wants to do the right thing by himself and the world - he is highly intelligent, very capable, knows what he wants for Russia and is prepared to listen.\" While Izvestia was wondering about \"the strange couple\" and why Mr Blair was seeing Mr Putin, the simplest answer seemed to be - they just like each other.",

That Michael Portillo, for so many years the anointed successor to Mrs Thatcher, should choose to leave it now is an event of some significance for the future direction of the Conservative party.</p> <p>Mr Portillo's public explanation is suitably anodyne. He has resigned because private remarks at an NTB dinner were made public. The real reason is because the split in the Conservative party is no longer left against right, but right against right.</p> <p>Broadly speaking, it is a dispute between mods and rockers, between those who wish to move the Conservative party forward and those who want to carry on listening to Elvis, a battle to be fought on the beaches of Blackpool and Bournemouth conferences over the next few years.</p> <p>Much still unites these factions. They are all free-marketeers. They are all Eurosceptics. They are, in one sense, Thatcherites who wish to roll back the frontiers of the state. They have chosen, instead, to found their differences on social policy. Messrs Portillo, Norris and Maude all wish to see a kinder, gentler conservatism. The NTBers see this as a soft and wishy-washy selling-out.</p> <p>Both, in their own ways, are wrong. Thatcherism was never about society - she said as much herself, though her quotation was taken out of context. Thatcherism was first and foremost about economics and strong government. Her political battles were fought over privatisation and the trade unions. Her interest in social policy was at best minimal. Her home secretaries - Willie Whitelaw and Douglas Hurd - were liberals, and she never whipped a vote on capital punishment.</p> <p>As far as morality went, she represented solid middle England values - the need to keep up appearances, not rock the boat and to spurn hand-outs from the state. But she was not prurient about people's private lives and tried as far as possible not to judge.</p> <p>S o the NTBers are wrong to see a kindlier, gentler Portillo as some sort of betrayal of a Thatcherite legacy. Mr Portillo is ploughing a furrow that he deems to be central to the current political zeitgeist, just as Mrs Thatcher did. It happens that under Mrs Thatcher, Britain became a more diverse, free and liberal country and Mr Portillo realises that the Tory party must now reflect this.</p> <p>All the same, Mrs Thatcher has let it be known that she considers Mr Portillo to be \"confused\". And this is where Mr Portillo is wrong. The reason that Mrs Thatcher remains such an enduring force in our political mythology is that she had about her an air of absolute clarity, conviction and resoluteness. She was not afraid to be unpopular provided she was effective. The new right of the Tory party has done enough navel gazing. With an election around the corner, it is time to return to conviction politics on issues of real substance.</p> <p>Like Kennedy, the Thatcher legacy is one of myth and romance. Each side takes from it what it wants. But what remains true is that her dominance continues, if only in a different form.</p> <p>Ed Vaizey is a Conservative.</p> <p>comment@theguardian.com</p>",

Broadly speaking, it is a dispute between mods and rockers, between those who wish to move the Conservative party forward and those who want to carry on listening to Elvis, a battle to be fought on the beaches of Blackpool and Bournemouth conferences over the next few years. Much still unites these factions. They are all free-marketeers. They are all Eurosceptics. They are, in one sense, Thatcherites who wish to roll back the frontiers of the state. They have chosen, instead, to found their differences on social policy. Messrs Portillo, Norris and Maude all wish to see a kinder, gentler conservatism. The NTBers see this as a soft and wishy-washy selling-out. Both, in their own ways, are wrong. Thatcherism was never about society - she said as much herself, though her quotation was taken out of context. Thatcherism was first and foremost about economics and strong government. Her political battles were fought over privatisation and the trade unions. Her interest in social policy was at best minimal. Her home secretaries - Willie Whitelaw and Douglas Hurd - were liberals, and she never whipped a vote on capital punishment. As far as morality went, she represented solid middle England values - the need to keep up appearances, not rock the boat and to spurn hand-outs from the state. But she was not prurient about people's private lives and tried as far as possible not to judge. S o the NTBers are wrong to see a kindlier, gentler Portillo as some sort of betrayal of a Thatcherite legacy. Mr Portillo is ploughing a furrow that he deems to be central to the current political zeitgeist, just as Mrs Thatcher did. It happens that under Mrs Thatcher, Britain became a more diverse, free and liberal country and Mr Portillo realises that the Tory party must now reflect this. All the same, Mrs Thatcher has let it be known that she considers Mr Portillo to be \"confused\". And this is where Mr Portillo is wrong. The reason that Mrs Thatcher remains such an enduring force in our political mythology is that she had about her an air of absolute clarity, conviction and resoluteness. She was not afraid to be unpopular provided she was effective. The new right of the Tory party has done enough navel gazing. With an election around the corner, it is time to return to conviction politics on issues of real substance. Like Kennedy, the Thatcher legacy is one of myth and romance. Each side takes from it what it wants. But what remains true is that her dominance continues, if only in a different form. Ed Vaizey is a Conservative. comment@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>The Thatcherite revolution of privatising state-owned utilities has been an unqualified success, says Philip Fletcher, the new water industry regulator. </p> <p>He told a London conference last week that \u00a350bn would have been invested by 2005 in improving drinking water and protecting the environment; leakage rates had been cut by a third and this year for the first time customers are enjoying the benefits of efficiency gains in the form of an average 12% cut in bills. </p> <p>\"There was nothing to suggest from the industry's pre-privatisation performance that public sector ownership would have delivered these benefits,\" he said. \"Equally, we have no proof that private monopolies - left alone - would have delivered them either.\" </p> <p>Tomorrow, Callum McCarthy, the energy market watchdog, will be similarly ecstatic about deregulation and privatisation. Nearly 6m gas and well over 5m electricity customers (29% of 20m and 20% of 25m respectively) who have switched suppliers have seen their bills cut by \u00a31bn a year since Ofgem, the body he heads, began introducing competition more than three years ago. </p> <p>A further \u00a31bn off bills has come from price controls on electricity distribution companies. </p> <p>Margaret Thatcher's \"bare-knuckled fight\" with industry never emerged; instead, regulators took a tough stand with the privatised companies. </p> <p>\"We spend more time focusing on our relations with the regulator than going out there and beating the world,\" says Brian Duckworth, managing director of Severn Trent. </p> <p>What has happened is a fundamental shift in the focus of the privatised companies' activities from promoting the interests of shareholders and the companies themselves to ensuring competition and guaranteeing consumers fair - that is lower - prices. </p> <p>In the early days of privatisation the Thatcherites' main concern was to create an army of \"Sids\", spreading the benefits of a shareholding democracy rather than promoting consumers, and reducing the utilities' demands on the public purse. The \"public interest\" was already served under this model in their view but regulators were appointed to act as what Peter Vass, director of Bath University's centre for the study of the regulated industries, calls \"surrogates for competition\". They did so in the form of price controls. Profits and shareholder returns flourished. </p> <p>All that has changed. BT, which still retained a 93% market share in 1993, is now under siege even though it retains 80% of all domestic phone calls. The duopoly in power generation - National Power and Powergen - has been eroded through competition and the seven producers, many foreign-owned, have seen their margins squashed by price controls. </p> <p>Water companies, squeezed by the regulators and shunned by the market, have toyed with the idea of returning ownership to customers; recently Glas Cymru proposed to make Welsh Water a debt-financed company answerable to its \"members\" rather than shareholders. </p> <p>When a partner at law firm Denton Hall remarked that regulators had far more power than ministers ever had, few paid attention. His name? Tom Winsor. His new job? Rail regulator.</p>",

He told a London conference last week that \u00a350bn would have been invested by 2005 in improving drinking water and protecting the environment; leakage rates had been cut by a third and this year for the first time customers are enjoying the benefits of efficiency gains in the form of an average 12% cut in bills. \"There was nothing to suggest from the industry's pre-privatisation performance that public sector ownership would have delivered these benefits,\" he said. \"Equally, we have no proof that private monopolies - left alone - would have delivered them either.\" Tomorrow, Callum McCarthy, the energy market watchdog, will be similarly ecstatic about deregulation and privatisation. Nearly 6m gas and well over 5m electricity customers (29% of 20m and 20% of 25m respectively) who have switched suppliers have seen their bills cut by \u00a31bn a year since Ofgem, the body he heads, began introducing competition more than three years ago. A further \u00a31bn off bills has come from price controls on electricity distribution companies. Margaret Thatcher's \"bare-knuckled fight\" with industry never emerged; instead, regulators took a tough stand with the privatised companies. \"We spend more time focusing on our relations with the regulator than going out there and beating the world,\" says Brian Duckworth, managing director of Severn Trent. What has happened is a fundamental shift in the focus of the privatised companies' activities from promoting the interests of shareholders and the companies themselves to ensuring competition and guaranteeing consumers fair - that is lower - prices. In the early days of privatisation the Thatcherites' main concern was to create an army of \"Sids\", spreading the benefits of a shareholding democracy rather than promoting consumers, and reducing the utilities' demands on the public purse. The \"public interest\" was already served under this model in their view but regulators were appointed to act as what Peter Vass, director of Bath University's centre for the study of the regulated industries, calls \"surrogates for competition\". They did so in the form of price controls. Profits and shareholder returns flourished. All that has changed. BT, which still retained a 93% market share in 1993, is now under siege even though it retains 80% of all domestic phone calls. The duopoly in power generation - National Power and Powergen - has been eroded through competition and the seven producers, many foreign-owned, have seen their margins squashed by price controls. Water companies, squeezed by the regulators and shunned by the market, have toyed with the idea of returning ownership to customers; recently Glas Cymru proposed to make Welsh Water a debt-financed company answerable to its \"members\" rather than shareholders. When a partner at law firm Denton Hall remarked that regulators had far more power than ministers ever had, few paid attention. His name? Tom Winsor. His new job? Rail regulator.",

But the main legacy of her time in Downing Street lives on, not just in Britain but across the world. </p> <p>The shorthand version of the Thatcher years, as retold in the Iron Lady's memoirs, and on the after-dinner circuit - where she earns an estimated \u00a31.5m a year - is that Britain was changed from the land of Red Robbo and wildcat strikes to the land of \"Sid\" and the share-owning democracy. In one stroke, the dead hand of the state was removed from the economy, unleashing a new spirit of enterprise and derring do. </p> <p>But memoirs, like memory, can play tricks. By the time the usually steely-eyed Lady Thatcher made her tearful departure in November 1990, one in four of the population owned shares and more than 40 former state-owned businesses had been privatised, a process which affected more than 600,000 workers in former nationalised industries. </p> <p>Privatisation was, however, no overnight revolution; rather it was a slow-burn process that only really began in Mrs Thatcher's second term. In fact Jim Callahan sold a chunk of BP in the 1970s to to keep the International Monetary Fund happy. What is more, the record of some companies that were denationalised looks different today from the late 80s, when tycoons like Lord King at British Airways were members of the prime minister's inner court. </p> <p><strong> Mad dash for shares</strong> </p> <p>The truth is that privatisation hardly featured at all between 1979 and 1983, when Mrs Thatcher was preoccupied by three struggles - the fight against inflation, the fight against the unions and the fight against the Argentines. Even during the second term, from 1983 to 1987 - easily the most radical of the four successive Conservative terms in office - there was no real conception of how a scheme to make money for the Treasury could be used as a weapon to win votes. </p> <p>It was only after the mad dash for shares in British Telecom in 1984 that the penny dropped in Downing Street. Privatisation was not just about ownership and industrial organisation, it was also about politics. As such, the BT sell off was followed by the privatisation of British Gas in 1986 and of Rolls-Royce, British Airways and the British Airports Authority in 1987. </p> <p>Apart from the unions and the Labour party, everybody seemed happy. The government had extra cash to spend on tax cuts, voters had shares which were going up in value and those running the companies had freedom to act and much fat ter pay packets. But how much has really changed? To be sure, many of those working in the old nationalised industries have lost their jobs as the newly cost-conscious companies responded to shareholder demands to boost productivity and profits. But BT is still seen as flabby and staid, BA is struggling to compete in the global airlines business, and Railtrack - a company sold off long after Mrs Thatcher was ousted - is dogged by controversy about whether privatisation is to blame for the state of the nation's railways. The tough regulation to prevent the privatised utilities exploiting their natural monopolies has made some of them hanker after giving up their PLC status. </p> <p>In her memoirs, the former prime minister evocatively described the sale of state assets as essential to \"eroding the corro sive and corrupting effects of socialism\". Yet five years after she left office, a star was created out of a 30-stone pink and black pig named Cedric, who was to come to symbolise corporate excess with its snout buried in the \"trough of privatisation\". Ironically, though, the level of pay being protested about then - a 75% rise for chief executive Cedric Brown, to \u00a3475,000 and potential performance-related bonus of \u00a3594,000 - would now barely cause even a raised eyebrow. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Lady Thatcher and her teams of politicial and financial advisers prefer not to dwell on the boardroom self-enrichment that followed privatisation, arguing instead that there were beneficial effects for the wider economy. </p> <p>Tony Carlisle, a City public relations adviser involved in 90% of the privatisations, acknowledges: \"One of the key accusations of privatisations is that it works for the bosses and the shareholders, but ... pity about the poor consumer.\" </p> <p>But he argues that privatisation actually served the consumer well.

Crossland will remain chairman but has handed over day-to-day operations as chief executive to his former managing director Tim Byrne with immediate effect. The City remained sceptical that Crossland was relinquishing real power in the company and questioned management's ability to produce a speedy turnaround of its loss-making business in Germany. Airtours shares, which have already lost 42% of their value this year, fell a further 14p to 223p. Takeover talk has always been diminished by Crossland owning 10% of the shares and Carnival Corp owning 25%. Profits before tax and exceptional items came in at \u00a3101.3m, down from \u00a3131.5m. But analysts said the latest figures were flattered by one-off gains. Airtours was hard hit by a number of problems, particularly continuing losses at Frosch Touristic in Germany which was bought earlier this year. Frosch suffered heavy competition combined with high overheads, and management there has been replaced. Mr Byrne said: \"Anything that could have been done wrong was being done wrong.\" A new German chief executive has been appointed but his name was not given yesterday \"for contractual reasons\". There were difficulties also at its North American Leisure Group where a \u00a316.1m profit was turned into a \u00a316.1m deficit over the 12 months to September 30. Airtours blamed a very bad millennium period for much of the losses saying the high price of holidays over that period encouraged many to stay at home. A range of changes had been put in place to cut costs with 150 of the 600 jobs being axed and a new boss being put in place. Mr Byrne admitted that costs had been too high across the group but he said this was being put right by a massive restructuring, which involved closing down a range of operations in Belgium, France and Holland. In Britain 600 jobs are to be lost at Woking in Surrey and others could go in Huddersfield in Yorkshire as Airtours relocates all its backroom operations to Rochdale in Lancashire. Mr Crossland said: \"I am confident that the strategic plans and actions initiated during the last 12 months, together with the strong forward booking growth, means Airtours is well placed to resume its profitable growth.\" Group bookings for this winter are up by 5% and summer 2001 by 4% year on year.

      "body": "<p>The Inland Revenue is buckling under the weight of tax and benefit reforms devised by chancellor Gordon Brown over the last 3 years as part of the Treasury's drive to influence the economy and redistribute wealth. </p> <p>Monitoring and implementing most of the new rules is a job that has increasingly been given to the Revenue and, while the government's main tax collecting agency claims it is improving the way it works, taxpayers' groups and tax advisers are almost unanimous in voicing concern about the organisation's ability to cope. </p> <p>Hundreds of staff due to switch from processing tax returns to investigating tax avoidance continue to wrestle with computer systems that have struggled to match expectations. Only last month the government sanctioned the Revenue closing 1m unresolved tax records to give staff a chance to tackle 5.2m records - almost 20% of the British workforce - that could not be found anywhere on the computer system. </p> <p>Changes in employee share schemes, property taxes and pension benefits for the elderly announced in the recent pre-budget statement will, say critics, worsen a situation that already has staff reeling at the organisation's headquarters in Somerset House on the Thames. The working families tax credit, soon to be superceded by the integrated child credit, the 10p tax rate that started in April and changes to capital gains tax that few people understand are some of the \"reforms\" already clogging up the Revenue's systems. </p> <p>Revenue chairman Nick Montagu is also wrestling with big picture changes. First the Revenue was told to leave tax processing to computers and slim down and concentrate on monitoring and investigating taxpayers. Then it was told to take work from the Benefits Agency, scale up and become Gordon Brown's main weapon as he attempts to re-engineer the economy. </p> <p>Staff costs have been rising instead of falling, with overall salaries topping \u00a31bn for the first time last year. John Whiting, a senior tax adviser at accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers, said he questions whether the agency has the manpower to deal with all the changes. \"It is coping with difficulty. There are plenty of signs of stress and strain.\" </p> <p>John Battersby, of accountants KPMG, argues that Mr Brown's changes are also having an impact on taxpayers. He points out that the guide produced by the Revenue to help taxpayers fill out their self-assessment tax return has leapt from eight pages last year to 28 pages for the 2000-2001 tax year. </p> <p>\"The Revenue has spread out some of the explanations to make them easier to understand and that accounts for a few extra pages. But well over 1,000 pages of tax legislation have been added to the statute book by this government. It shows how much more complicated it will be for the 9m people who calculate their own tax to get it right.\"Pensioners are struggling to fill in their tax returns, following a raft of changes to the way benefits are calculated, the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group said yesterday. A huge centralisation of tax district offices has also led to a cut in the number of services available to pensioners, including home visits, the group said. </p> <p>One body representing tax advisers, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, has gone so far as to say that tax rules are now so complicated that \"a culture of non-compliance will become more commonplace\". </p> <p>A Revenue spokesman said: \"We don't accept that the Revenue cannot cope with the pace of change. We have put in place a lot of support for businesses and individuals to meet their responsibilities.\" </p> <p>The complexities of the tax system have undoubtedly been felt inside the agency. In the last year the Revenue has been forced to abandon the exact calculation of 6.2m PAYE records for the 1998-1999 tax year. As a result, millions of taxpayers have possibly paid too much tax, while others have paid too little. Most of them will never know if they did or not. The only comfort offered by Revenue officials is that they think the sums involved are small. </p> <p>Much of the problem centres on the dif ficulties two computer systems have talking to each other. Marrying computer records with paper records sent in by employers has also been blamed. </p> <p>In the past two years the government has pushed through a merger with the Contributions Agency, which handles the collection of national insurance. The agency was saddled with a system called Nirs2, designed and run by the consultancy firm Andersen Consulting. MPs on the public accounts committee, the main parliamentary watchdog, said in the summer that the system had never worked properly and believed it would still not be fully functional until April 2001, despite denials from Andersen and the Revenue. </p> <p>The Revenue's PAYE computer run by US firm EDS has also had its problems. Earlier this year it wrongly sent out letters to thousands of taxpayers, telling them they paid too little or too much tax. By the Revenue's own admission it still locks out users for one hour in every 100. </p> <p>The organisation's ability to track down fraud is also under question. As part of a switch in direction ordered by the last government, the Revenue is supposed to leave the processing of tax returns to computers and switch to monitoring, checking and investigating, much like America's much feared Internal Revenue Service. </p> <p>But according to the last available figures for the year ending March 1999, the Revenue successfully pursued only 32 cases of fraud through to conviction. </p> <p>The previous year the Revenue's fraud investigations team - the special compliance office - could claim a tally of guilty verdicts almost double at 62. Embarrassment at the collapse in number of successful prosecutions is matched by the fact that a third of the 32 guilty verdicts in 1999 were for internal fraud and imposed on Inland Revenue employees. A year before convictions for internal fraud were a fifth of the total. </p> <p>The Revenue said an improvement would show through in this year's figures - due out this month - and said the figures for internal fraud were slightly exaggerated by the inclusion of \"external accomplices\". According to taxpayer groups and accountants the situation is likely to worsen across all departments unless the chancellor reigns in his reforming zeal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Inland Revenue is buckling under the weight of tax and benefit reforms devised by chancellor Gordon Brown over the last 3 years as part of the Treasury's drive to influence the economy and redistribute wealth. Monitoring and implementing most of the new rules is a job that has increasingly been given to the Revenue and, while the government's main tax collecting agency claims it is improving the way it works, taxpayers' groups and tax advisers are almost unanimous in voicing concern about the organisation's ability to cope. Hundreds of staff due to switch from processing tax returns to investigating tax avoidance continue to wrestle with computer systems that have struggled to match expectations. Only last month the government sanctioned the Revenue closing 1m unresolved tax records to give staff a chance to tackle 5.2m records - almost 20% of the British workforce - that could not be found anywhere on the computer system. Changes in employee share schemes, property taxes and pension benefits for the elderly announced in the recent pre-budget statement will, say critics, worsen a situation that already has staff reeling at the organisation's headquarters in Somerset House on the Thames. The working families tax credit, soon to be superceded by the integrated child credit, the 10p tax rate that started in April and changes to capital gains tax that few people understand are some of the \"reforms\" already clogging up the Revenue's systems. Revenue chairman Nick Montagu is also wrestling with big picture changes. First the Revenue was told to leave tax processing to computers and slim down and concentrate on monitoring and investigating taxpayers. Then it was told to take work from the Benefits Agency, scale up and become Gordon Brown's main weapon as he attempts to re-engineer the economy. Staff costs have been rising instead of falling, with overall salaries topping \u00a31bn for the first time last year. John Whiting, a senior tax adviser at accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers, said he questions whether the agency has the manpower to deal with all the changes. \"It is coping with difficulty. There are plenty of signs of stress and strain.\" John Battersby, of accountants KPMG, argues that Mr Brown's changes are also having an impact on taxpayers. He points out that the guide produced by the Revenue to help taxpayers fill out their self-assessment tax return has leapt from eight pages last year to 28 pages for the 2000-2001 tax year. \"The Revenue has spread out some of the explanations to make them easier to understand and that accounts for a few extra pages. But well over 1,000 pages of tax legislation have been added to the statute book by this government. It shows how much more complicated it will be for the 9m people who calculate their own tax to get it right.\"Pensioners are struggling to fill in their tax returns, following a raft of changes to the way benefits are calculated, the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group said yesterday. A huge centralisation of tax district offices has also led to a cut in the number of services available to pensioners, including home visits, the group said. One body representing tax advisers, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, has gone so far as to say that tax rules are now so complicated that \"a culture of non-compliance will become more commonplace\". A Revenue spokesman said: \"We don't accept that the Revenue cannot cope with the pace of change. We have put in place a lot of support for businesses and individuals to meet their responsibilities.\" The complexities of the tax system have undoubtedly been felt inside the agency. In the last year the Revenue has been forced to abandon the exact calculation of 6.2m PAYE records for the 1998-1999 tax year. As a result, millions of taxpayers have possibly paid too much tax, while others have paid too little. Most of them will never know if they did or not. The only comfort offered by Revenue officials is that they think the sums involved are small. Much of the problem centres on the dif ficulties two computer systems have talking to each other. Marrying computer records with paper records sent in by employers has also been blamed. In the past two years the government has pushed through a merger with the Contributions Agency, which handles the collection of national insurance. The agency was saddled with a system called Nirs2, designed and run by the consultancy firm Andersen Consulting. MPs on the public accounts committee, the main parliamentary watchdog, said in the summer that the system had never worked properly and believed it would still not be fully functional until April 2001, despite denials from Andersen and the Revenue. The Revenue's PAYE computer run by US firm EDS has also had its problems. Earlier this year it wrongly sent out letters to thousands of taxpayers, telling them they paid too little or too much tax. By the Revenue's own admission it still locks out users for one hour in every 100. The organisation's ability to track down fraud is also under question. As part of a switch in direction ordered by the last government, the Revenue is supposed to leave the processing of tax returns to computers and switch to monitoring, checking and investigating, much like America's much feared Internal Revenue Service. But according to the last available figures for the year ending March 1999, the Revenue successfully pursued only 32 cases of fraud through to conviction. The previous year the Revenue's fraud investigations team - the special compliance office - could claim a tally of guilty verdicts almost double at 62. Embarrassment at the collapse in number of successful prosecutions is matched by the fact that a third of the 32 guilty verdicts in 1999 were for internal fraud and imposed on Inland Revenue employees. A year before convictions for internal fraud were a fifth of the total. The Revenue said an improvement would show through in this year's figures - due out this month - and said the figures for internal fraud were slightly exaggerated by the inclusion of \"external accomplices\". According to taxpayer groups and accountants the situation is likely to worsen across all departments unless the chancellor reigns in his reforming zeal.",

      "body": "<p>My father tells an intriguing story. Early in 1947, when as \"Frankie Lyons\" he was a young comedian entertaining the troops throughout the Middle East, he was travelling north through the Sinai Desert in the back of a props truck when the vehicle came off the road and overturned. </p> <p>He sustained injuries to his legs and face and was sent to hospital in Jerusalem to recuperate. While he was there he wrote to my grandmother back in Norbiton to tell her what had happened and he received in reply a letter full of worry. </p> <p>She had read reports in British newspapers that illegal drugs had been found on a Combined Services Entertainment props truck that had overturned on a road in Palestine. The reports said that a CSE sergeant had been arrested, along with others. My dad was a sergeant, and my poor grandmother must have put two and two together and made five. In fact, the truck with drugs on board had come to grief some way north of where my father had his accident, overturning on a road between Jerusalem and Gaza. </p> <p>But it was little wonder my grandmother was having kittens. The drugs operation was no tinpot smuggling caper reminiscent of an Ealing comedy. It was an attempt to shift a large consignment of narcotics. </p> <p>On March 7, 1947 The Times printed a dispatch from Jerusalem filed the previous day. It said: \"A large quantity of opium and hashish has been discovered by military police among stage equipment in a lorry used by a Combined Services Entertainment company that has been touring Palestine for the last two months. The players left Jerusalem for Gaza in an omnibus followed by the lorry carrying the 'props'. Later the lorry parted company with the bus and took a minor road, where it overturned. When the military police arrived on the scene they found 195 pieces of opium and 941 slabs of hashish, the total value of which is \u00a340,000. A British driver and a British sergeant have been arrested here, and two arrests have been made in Egypt.\" </p> <p>Half a ton of drugs was allegedly seized, worth millions of pounds at today's street prices. There was a high incidence of drug trafficking among British military personnel in the region during this period, but even so, the military police must have seen this as a major coup. </p> <p>Meanwhile, my dad recovered from his injuries and spent several weeks touring with a show in Palestine. It was only when he returned to the CSE headquarters in Cairo that he heard rumours that the arrested sergeant was a fellow comic and ex-Horse Guard called Thomas Cooper - Cooper the Trooper. </p> <p>The young Cooper was not universally popular in Cairo, remarkable as that may seem to us now. He was certainly all too familiar to my father. Only a few months before, the two of them had been detailed to work together as a double act by the local CSE management, who were trying to put together a new variety show. Before that, both men had independently made names for themselves as comics in Cairo and on military bases all the way from Tobruk to Tel Aviv. They worked on the same bill in For Your Approval, an occasional cabaret performed at the Cairo YMCA. But, after a brief honeymoon period, the double act became one of the British Army's least fine hours and was terminated by the management before it ever reached the stage. </p> <p>This isn't so surprising. The marvellously original comic that Cooper was to become had already begun to develop his highly individual style - the bungled magic tricks and the outrageously corny one-liners - and was bound to find it hard working alongside a more traditional, less confident entertainer. </p> <p>But, like many geniuses, Cooper had a gigantic ego to match his talent. Other Cairo artists from the time confirm my father's impression of the 24-year-old Cooper as a driven obsessive, desperate to find fame and unable to switch off his act even when away from the stage. He was jealous and selfish, prone to violent rages and not averse to running off with a show's earnings without paying the rest of the cast. </p> <p>This all came as a shock to me when I started research for my play Frankie and Tommy, a dramatic account of the mismatched double-act that has just received its London premiere. I knew there had been some bad feeling between the pair, but I was unaware that the relationship had been quite so acrimonious. The picture of Cooper that emerged from interviews I did during my research was at great variance to the image of the genial, bumbling clown and devoted family man the British public adored. </p> <p>I have no doubt that age and success mellowed Cooper, and that he could be warm-hearted and charming as well as hilarious. But, for some, he remained a monster to work with throughout his career. He could be mean as well as generous, had a history of alcohol abuse and suffered a great deal of emotional turmoil in his private life. </p> <p>Even now, 16 years after his death on live television, Cooper devotees refuse to accept that there was pain or anger lurking beneath the fez. (The famous story of Cooper getting the idea of the fez when he snatched one from the head of a Egyptian waiter is an example of showbiz mythologising - the fez was the traditional headgear of the conjurer-clown in English music hall.) I find this reluctance to peek behind the curtain of Cooper's humour strange, particularly when we have scrutinised other comics of his generation, such as Tony Hancock, Benny Hill and Sid James. I recall a woman walking out when Frankie and Tommy was performed at the Edinburgh festival, muttering \"Sacrilege!\". </p> <p>She is not the only fan I have come across who regards Cooper as an entertainment saint or deity, whose image should not be desecrated or abused. But, as a playwright, I'm fascinated by what motivates a compulsive comic like Cooper. It doesn't destroy the legend to understand that his humour stemmed from deep-seated social inadequacy. On the contrary, I believe it enriches it. </p> <p>Social inadequacy is one thing. Drug-running is quite another. Was Cooper the sergeant arrested on the Gaza road? There is no evidence that this was anything other than malicious gossip. In any case, the driver concerned does not appear to have been charged. </p> <p>However, according to a number of sources, the show Cooper fronted at the time was called Juke Box. On August 27, 1947 The Times reported that a lieutenant, described as the manager of the Juke Box road show, had been acquitted in Jerusalem of a charge of conspiring to smuggle the drugs that were seized. </p> <p>Of course, this far from implicates Cooper. The fact that he may have been in the same show is purely circumstantial, but it is an interesting point nonetheless. The full truth may lurk in military police records in the Public Records Office, in Colonial Office papers that will stay shut for another 22 years. </p> <p>\u0095 Frankie and Tommy is at the Lyric Studio, Hammersmith, London W6, until December 9.

      "body": "<p>Gidon Kremer has pale but piercing eyes. Or rather, his eyes, gazing out from behind neat, wire-framed specs, do not so much pierce as seem to pin you against the wall. The Latvian violinist is very intense, and does not laugh very much. He is also tired. He got up at three in the morning to catch a plane to London from his home in Paris for a two-hour rehearsal. In an hour or so he will take another plane to Milan. </p> <p>\"I am thinking about my young daughter who is seven, and who plays the piano,\" he says. \"I don't know if I want her to lead such a hard life as I do. I wouldn't wish a day like this on anyone.\" But this hard life has a good side, for us at least. Without Kremer, many music-lovers might never have heard of two great 20th-century composers - Alfred Schnittke and Astor Piazzolla. </p> <p>Born in 1947 in Riga, Kremer grew up in Latvia before moving to Moscow to study under the violinist David Oistrakh. He was the child of violinists, both of whom had their careers blown to the winds by the second world war. His Jewish father survived the Holocaust by hiding in a Riga cellar for two years, and the young Kremer was groomed to fulfil his father's frustrated ambitions. That was not his only burden. \"Growing up in a totalitarian regime, I also had to endure the pressure of the state ideology. It was hard, trying to be a free artist.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, Kremer flourished musically, winning numerous prizes. The most important was the 1970 Tchaikovsky competition, where conductor Herbert von Karajan was moved to call him \"the greatest violinist in the world\". For the next 10 years, until he finally left the Soviet Union, Kremer struggled against the regime, risking his career promoting the music of seriously out-of-favour composers - Schnittke and Arvo Part among them. </p> <p>\"If you wanted to perform music that you loved and believed in but was not written in a socialist-realist style, you got into trouble,\" he says. \"Schnittke's music was not forbidden but there were very few artists willing to risk their careers to present it. It took some efforts.\" Schnittke's fourth and last violin concerto, written in 1984, was dedicated to Kremer. The composer and violinist's initials, translated into musical notation, formed a framework for much of the work. </p> <p>One of Kremer's other great enthusiasms, the work of the Argentine Astor Piazzolla, has led to his recording six CDs of the composer's music over the past four years. Piazzolla, who studied composition in Paris under Nadia Boulanger, and returned to Buenos Aires to breathe new life into the tango, died in 1992 little known outside South America. Now he is intensely fashionable; performances of his heady, complex tangos proliferate. </p> <p>Though Kremer does not shy away from the traditional repertoire - he was in London to rehearse the Sibelius concerto - his sense of adventure is at the heart of his identity as a performer. He is an explorer on the borders of the known musical world. \"For me it would be too boring to play music by only dead composers or to present music as if it were in a waxworks museum,\" he says. \"I don't want music to be a matter of comfort but of expansion of the spirit.\" </p> <p>Kremer's interpretations of Piazzolla have been criticised for being too coolly postmodern and tame, for not reeking strongly enough of the sweat and smoke and sex of the world of tango. Maybe so, but Kremer will never give his audience an easy ride. He can produce sounds as soft and creamy as fresh butter, then jolt you with crash landings and emergency stops. His violin does not merely sing; it strains and rasps and rattles and groans. \"One of my favourite conductors, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, says, 'Don't strive for perfection, because perfection is in conflict with beauty.' I would say that my role is to deliver something of beauty. Not ordinary stuff. Not something that is merely perfect.\" </p> <p>Does he agree that he plays at the very limits of his physical ability? \"Being on the edge, being on the border, being extreme - this is correct,\" he replies. \"I know so many colleagues who deliver great performances on the scale of technique. But very often behind it there is an empty message, or no message at all.\" </p> <p>Just as Kremer's playing occasionally strains, so too do his words. You feel that his mind is roaming free and that language - or at least English - cannot quite contain it. But then Kremer, who has lost his childhood fluency in Latvian but speaks Russian, English, German and French, believes that music is also a language, and one that can express emotion in its rawest form. </p> <p>This is crucial when it comes to selecting repertoire. It attracted him to Schnittke and Part, and more recently to the Georgian composer Giya Kancheli. He talks about music with a \"human heart\". \"This is what drew me to Piazzolla,\" he says. \"He has the same sense of beauty and nostalgia that Schubert had.\" It is typical of the connections that Kremer makes that he should talk of a 19th-century Austrian and a 20th-century Argentine as if they were contemporaries, even friends. \"I am attached to music that speaks to you and does not just manipulate your sophistication. The point is not only to say something unheard of before but to say it in a language of emotion. Music can be a mirror of ourselves. It offers us the opportunity for reflection. </p> <p>\"Occasionally the audience is not aware of the precious things that are presented to them,\" he says sadly. </p> <p>In 1997 Kremer set up the Kremerata Baltica, an ensemble of young musicians drawn from the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. This move is not merely musical or personal. \"To defend their national identities and to do something good for the music of those countries - this is certainly political,\" he says. There is a poetic justice to it - after all those years of being identified as a Soviet or Russian violinist, Kremer is staking out a territory of his own. </p> <p>He works with Kremerata Baltica for about five months of the year. \"They are still fresh, still far away from the routine of many orchestras that are really only to do with money-making.\" One of their recordings, of works by the Latvian Peteris Vasks, contains a note by the composer about his 1991 piece Balsis. He writes of \"the Soviet empire's dying excesses and the peaceful resistance of the Baltic peoples\". </p> <p>This does not mean, however, that Kremer regards Latvia as the place where he belongs. Championing the music and musicians of the Baltic states (he has recently recorded a disc of contemporary Baltic music called From My Home) does not provide \"an ID of myself. It is part of my past, and I pay tribute to it, just as I pay tribute to other parts of my past. A big part of my life is to do with Russian culture.\" </p> <p>So where is home? \"I have lost the sense of home. It is very dispersed, it is very vague. It is here,\" he says, tapping his head. \"It is more the idea of a creative process in which I feel at home. It is an internal landscape. Inside this home I know all my shelves better than I do the ones in Paris. When I return to Paris, I find that my books are not where I thought they were. The shelves of my mind are a little more ordered.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Gidon Kremer gives a recital on Saturday at the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1. Box office: 020-7960 4201. His CD of the complete Schnittke violin concertos, and Kremerata Baltica's latest disc of Baltic music, Silencio, are both out on Teldec.</p>",

This move is not merely musical or personal. \"To defend their national identities and to do something good for the music of those countries - this is certainly political,\" he says. There is a poetic justice to it - after all those years of being identified as a Soviet or Russian violinist, Kremer is staking out a territory of his own. He works with Kremerata Baltica for about five months of the year. \"They are still fresh, still far away from the routine of many orchestras that are really only to do with money-making.\" One of their recordings, of works by the Latvian Peteris Vasks, contains a note by the composer about his 1991 piece Balsis. He writes of \"the Soviet empire's dying excesses and the peaceful resistance of the Baltic peoples\". This does not mean, however, that Kremer regards Latvia as the place where he belongs. Championing the music and musicians of the Baltic states (he has recently recorded a disc of contemporary Baltic music called From My Home) does not provide \"an ID of myself. It is part of my past, and I pay tribute to it, just as I pay tribute to other parts of my past. A big part of my life is to do with Russian culture.\" So where is home? \"I have lost the sense of home. It is very dispersed, it is very vague. It is here,\" he says, tapping his head. \"It is more the idea of a creative process in which I feel at home. It is an internal landscape. Inside this home I know all my shelves better than I do the ones in Paris. When I return to Paris, I find that my books are not where I thought they were. The shelves of my mind are a little more ordered.\" \u0095 Gidon Kremer gives a recital on Saturday at the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1. Box office: 020-7960 4201. His CD of the complete Schnittke violin concertos, and Kremerata Baltica's latest disc of Baltic music, Silencio, are both out on Teldec.",

The Czech Republic, a former member of the Warsaw Pact and now also a member of the transatlantic alliance, offered chemical warfare specialists, commandos and transport helicopters. Slovakia said it could provide 450 men. Similar offers came from Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Malta, though few specifics were announced. Iceland and Norway, in Nato but not the EU, also made offers. \"These contributions were substantial.\" said Alain Richard, defence minister of France, which holds the EU rotating presidency. On Monday the EU launched what many in Brussels - and national capitals - see as the union's most ambitious project since the single currency: building a 60,000-strong force that would operate in crises in which Nato chooses not to get involved. Defence ministers pledged a poll of about 100,000 troops, 400 combat aircraft and 100 ships for use in peacekeeping, evacuation and humanitarian operations. But it was the Turkish offer, including a mechanised infantry brigade, armour, air defence forces, eight ships and two squadrons of F-16 fighters, that stole yesterday's show. Diplomats described Ankara's position as \"very positive,\" despite unresolved questions about how the EU force will work with Nato. Turkey, ever sensitive about its relations with the EU, has been blocking EU access to Nato documents. \"The Turks are being very stubborn,\" said one alliance diplomat. \"They are very worried that the EU might use this stuff in their region without their seal of approval.\" Nato insists it is broadly pleased with the EU's defence initiative, despite warnings from Eurosceptic Britons about the danger of undermining the alliance. France, always ambivalent about relying on US power, has been sounding distinctly conciliatory in recent days, though it is far from clear whether new institutional arrangements can be agreed in time for next month's EU summit in Nice. Speaking in Berlin yesterday, the Nato secretary-general, Lord Robertson, stressed that EU plans, if properly funded and organised, will strengthen Nato's overall capabilities and see Europe shoulder more responsibility for peacekeeping and crisis-management missions. According to the EU timetable, by 2003 the rapid reaction force will be capable of deploying within 60 days and remaining on the ground for up to a year. \"That's quite an ambitious target,\" Lord Robertson said. \"I hope they make it, but it will mean substantial investment will have to be made during that time, and I'll be there to remind them of their commitment.\" Speaking during a visit to Moscow, Tony Blair complained about the press coverage of EU plans. \"I am used to the British media being impossible on the subject of Europe but I hope very much the public will at last be given the facts,\" the prime minister said. \"I will not let this type of anti-European nonsense disturb the true national interests of our country.\"",

      "bodyText": "Turkey's death sentence against the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan was challenged in the European Court of Human Rights yesterday. It is a case which could have profound repercussions for Ankara's ever sensitive relations with the EU. As thousands of supporters and opponents gathered outside the court in Strasbourg amidst heavy security, seven judges were asked to rule on whether the complaint was admissable. At the same time Turkey's foreign minister accused the EU of acting like \"colonial governors\" in dealings with his country. Ocalan's appeal is on the grounds that he was denied a fair trial because Turkey violated the European Convention on Human Rights, under which the court was established. Although the court is entirely distinct from the European Union, observance of the convention is mandatory for all members of the EU, which Turkey has long aspired to join. The court has the power to overturn rulings from national courts that it deems in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. It has frequently ruled against Turkey on human rights issues, and though a member of the Council of Europe and supposed to abide by the court's rulings, it has ignored them. Ocalan, founder of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party or PKK, was kidnapped by special agents in Kenya in 1998 and flown to Turkey for a trial at which he was condemned to hang for hundreds of killings in the PKK's 16-year war against Turkey and its army. The Turkish authorities have not carried out a death sentence since 1984.

Also involved is Gareth Peirce, known for her involvement in cases where miscarriage of justice is alleged. Some 60 to 70 relatives of Turkish soldiers killed in the war against the PKK rebels sat in the galleries at Strasbourg along with similar numbers of Ocalan supporters.

The Sony Dream Robot, or SDR-3X, is a 50cm-tall humanoid that packs a wicked shot and celebrates a goal by going down on its silver knees and throwing its arms up in the air in triumph. With 24 joints, the anthropomorphic machine is also a smooth mover when it comes to Japan's latest dance craze - the para para, which is a cross between Saturday Night Fever disco style and line dancing.

Last week, Honda unveiled the world's most advanced anthropomorphic robot, Asimo, which is capable of extremely smooth movement as well as face identity and voice recognition. Matsushita is developing a line of techno-pets that will provide company and give medical advice to elderly people living alone. NEC is working on a sophisticated egg-shaped messenger robot that will roll around the home passing on email messages. But SDR-3X comes closest to a sporting robot.

      "body": "<p>A day of bombs and gunfire rocked the fortress-like Jewish outposts of the Gaza Strip yesterday, as Palestinian militants stepped up their attacks to drive out the settlers.</p> <p>The morning after Israeli gunboats and attack helicopters pounded Gaza City in retaliation for the bombing of a school bus of Jewish settlers, the deadly cycle of vengeance resumed.</p> <p>The Red Cross warned from its Geneva headquarters that the conflict had reached a crossroads and appealed to Israel and the Palestinians to stop targeting civilians and taking reprisals against them.</p> <p>Angelo Gnaedinger, the senior Red Cross delegate for the Middle East, said: \"We are, both in political and humanitarian terms, at a crossing.\"</p> <p>The use of \"extreme and heavy weaponry\" such as attack helicopters was, he warned, bringing events \"to the brink of outright warfare\".</p> <p>As the people of Gaza City picked their way through rubble and glass to take stock of the damage of the night before, armed militants unleashed their wrath against the isolated groups of Jewish settlers.</p> <p>\"It's the Arab way, you see,\" said one Palestinian commuter, craning to hear the car radio of a nearby taxi. \"If they kill one of us, we have to kill 10 of them.\"</p> <p>By noon, two Palestinian men had been shot dead near the Jewish settlement of Gush Katif: one had been trying to detonate a bomb at an important road junction; the second, a policeman, opened fire at Israeli troops at Kfar Darom, the Jewish settlement where Monday's bus bombing took place.</p> <p>Hours later, as Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, was visiting an army base in the Gaza area an Israeli man, aged 18, was shot in the head by Palestinians who opened up on a settler convoy. Another Israeli was wounded last night in two explosions in the same area.</p> <p>Yesterday's attacks may not dent the resolve of the 6,500 Jewish settlers determined to stay in Gaza despite the bitter resentment of more than 1m Arabs in this in this sandy Palestinian territory. The settlers who control Gaza's scarce water resources and best land enjoy the fruits of a lucrative agriculture industry - but for Israel, their presence is becoming an increasingly costly proposition.</p> <p>Although Gaza was the focus of yesterday's violence, in the West Bank there was no let-up in the bloodshed that has killed nearly 250 people in the last eight weeks. A Palestinian teenager was killed, shot in the chest by Israeli soldiers at Tulkarm. Another Palestinian was killed in Jenin.</p> <p>The potential for further bloodshed loomed even larger after some leading Palestinian figures proclaimed the peace process \"clinically dead\". In Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority announced that in areas where it has jurisdiction its 40,000 policemen were now under orders to protect protesters from Israeli fire.</p> <p>There have been dozens of instances where Palestinian police have fired on Israeli soldiers or ambushed them, but yesterday's directive added a dangerous new element.</p> <p>\"We are in the same trench with our people on one front against the Israelis,\" Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, general secretary of the authority, declared. \"Our policemen will now use their guns in self-defence in areas under our full sovereignty. They have the right to respond.\"</p> <p>For Gazans, who spent a terrifying night in total darkness, waiting for the clatter of the helicopters to fade, daylight brought the realisation that Israel's punishment could have been even more deadly. Only one man was killed, and among the 60 hurt, most suffered relatively minor injuries.</p> <p>At the wretched jumble of cement houses that makes up the densely packed Jabaliya refugee camp, missiles had punched a hole in every one of the barracks of the training school for Yasser Arafat's elite Force 17 guard.</p> <p>In the refugee housing, a missile in the adjacent alley shattered the corrugated roof of Sohail Fahmi el-Hassani's home, and sent shards of asbestos hurtling into the living room. Three of his nine children were cut when the roof caved in. \"What were they aiming at? There are no military positions in this area,\" said the unemployed plasterer, his frightened seven-year-old son clinging to his legs.</p> <p>The damage was relatively limited among his neighbours, but the fury was intense.</p> <p>\"We want to tell Mr Barak and Mr Clinton: \"Why kill my children, and my brother, and all the other children, why?\" said Abla Khatib, a school teacher.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\" target=\"_new\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\" target=\"_new\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.iris.org.il/\" target=\"_new\">Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "A day of bombs and gunfire rocked the fortress-like Jewish outposts of the Gaza Strip yesterday, as Palestinian militants stepped up their attacks to drive out the settlers. The morning after Israeli gunboats and attack helicopters pounded Gaza City in retaliation for the bombing of a school bus of Jewish settlers, the deadly cycle of vengeance resumed. The Red Cross warned from its Geneva headquarters that the conflict had reached a crossroads and appealed to Israel and the Palestinians to stop targeting civilians and taking reprisals against them. Angelo Gnaedinger, the senior Red Cross delegate for the Middle East, said: \"We are, both in political and humanitarian terms, at a crossing.\" The use of \"extreme and heavy weaponry\" such as attack helicopters was, he warned, bringing events \"to the brink of outright warfare\". As the people of Gaza City picked their way through rubble and glass to take stock of the damage of the night before, armed militants unleashed their wrath against the isolated groups of Jewish settlers. \"It's the Arab way, you see,\" said one Palestinian commuter, craning to hear the car radio of a nearby taxi. \"If they kill one of us, we have to kill 10 of them.\" By noon, two Palestinian men had been shot dead near the Jewish settlement of Gush Katif: one had been trying to detonate a bomb at an important road junction; the second, a policeman, opened fire at Israeli troops at Kfar Darom, the Jewish settlement where Monday's bus bombing took place. Hours later, as Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, was visiting an army base in the Gaza area an Israeli man, aged 18, was shot in the head by Palestinians who opened up on a settler convoy. Another Israeli was wounded last night in two explosions in the same area. Yesterday's attacks may not dent the resolve of the 6,500 Jewish settlers determined to stay in Gaza despite the bitter resentment of more than 1m Arabs in this in this sandy Palestinian territory. The settlers who control Gaza's scarce water resources and best land enjoy the fruits of a lucrative agriculture industry - but for Israel, their presence is becoming an increasingly costly proposition. Although Gaza was the focus of yesterday's violence, in the West Bank there was no let-up in the bloodshed that has killed nearly 250 people in the last eight weeks. A Palestinian teenager was killed, shot in the chest by Israeli soldiers at Tulkarm. Another Palestinian was killed in Jenin. The potential for further bloodshed loomed even larger after some leading Palestinian figures proclaimed the peace process \"clinically dead\". In Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority announced that in areas where it has jurisdiction its 40,000 policemen were now under orders to protect protesters from Israeli fire. There have been dozens of instances where Palestinian police have fired on Israeli soldiers or ambushed them, but yesterday's directive added a dangerous new element. \"We are in the same trench with our people on one front against the Israelis,\" Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, general secretary of the authority, declared. \"Our policemen will now use their guns in self-defence in areas under our full sovereignty. They have the right to respond.\" For Gazans, who spent a terrifying night in total darkness, waiting for the clatter of the helicopters to fade, daylight brought the realisation that Israel's punishment could have been even more deadly. Only one man was killed, and among the 60 hurt, most suffered relatively minor injuries. At the wretched jumble of cement houses that makes up the densely packed Jabaliya refugee camp, missiles had punched a hole in every one of the barracks of the training school for Yasser Arafat's elite Force 17 guard. In the refugee housing, a missile in the adjacent alley shattered the corrugated roof of Sohail Fahmi el-Hassani's home, and sent shards of asbestos hurtling into the living room. Three of his nine children were cut when the roof caved in. \"What were they aiming at? There are no military positions in this area,\" said the unemployed plasterer, his frightened seven-year-old son clinging to his legs. The damage was relatively limited among his neighbours, but the fury was intense. \"We want to tell Mr Barak and Mr Clinton: \"Why kill my children, and my brother, and all the other children, why?\" said Abla Khatib, a school teacher.

      "bodyText": "Egypt recalled its ambassador from Tel Aviv yesterday as a protest at Israel's shelling of Gaza. The foreign minister, Amr Moussa, said the move was a result of \"Israel's aggression against the Palestinian people, and its intentional excessive use of force\". Foreign ministry sources said no decision had been taken on how long the ambassador, Mohammed Bassyouni would be kept in Cairo. The same sources maintained that the recall was only a first step, \"as Egypt now is conducting a comprehensive review of the whole situation in light of Israel's violent policy and the escalation in the use of force.\" In 1979 Egypt became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel, bringing accusations from neighbours that Cairo had put self-interest before regional solidarity. The past two months of violence between Israelis and Palestinians has again exposed Egypt to such criticism. \"It is becoming more and more embarrassing for Egypt to maintain full diplomatic relations with Israel,\" Hussein Amin, a former Egyptian ambassador to Algeria, conceded yesterday. President Hosni Mubarak had resisted pressure by hardline Arab states - such as Syria and Iraq - to sever ties with Israel since the new Palestinian uprising started more than seven weeks ago. Shortly before hosting an Arab summit on October 21, Mr Mubarak said he was opposed to breaking relations because communications with Israel should be kept open. When Cairo cut ties in 1982 to protest at Israel's invasion of Lebanon, he said, dialogue with Israeli officials was difficult. The Egyptian ambassador at that time stayed in Cairo for eight months. Yesterday, Israel's foreign minister, Shlomo Bin-Ami, said it was not considering any retaliatory recall of its ambassador in Cairo. Jordan, the only other Arab state to have signed a peace treaty with Israel, is maintaining relations with Tel Aviv, saying its contacts are aimed at benefiting the Palestinian side in eventual peace talks. But Jordan has signalled its displeasure by refraining from sending its newly appointed ambassador to Israel. On Sunday, an Israeli diplomat in Amman was shot and slightly wounded. Leaders at the Arab summit in Cairo last month threatened to intensify measures gradually against Israel if the violence continued. Oman, Morocco, Tunisia and Qatar - among the few Arab countries who responded to US pressure to establish ties with Israel to encourage the Israeli public to support peace - had already decided to close low-level representation offices in Tel Aviv, and Israel's similar offices in their countries. Mauritania is now the only Arab country maintaining normal diplomatic ties. Mustafa Kamel el-Sayed, a political science professor at Cairo University, said in an interview yesterday that Egypt's decision was unlikely to alter Israel's policy towards the Palestinians. \"This decision will mainly satisfy Egyptian and Arab public opinion which has been calling for such a step,\" he said. Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, said on a visit to Gaza: \"I am not, of course, happy about the fact that Egypt has decided to recall the ambassador and I express my hope that it will be for a short time.\" Egypt, he went on, \"has a role in the peace process, a positive role, and I do not think that the recall of the ambassador ... contributes to continuation of this positive role\". But Professor Sayed argued that in reality Israel would not feel too bothered by the actions of the Egyptian leaders \"because of the strong support it is getting from the United States and Europe\". In the longer term, however, Prof Sayed predicted, \"Israel is not just jeopardising its prospects of reaching peace with Palestinians, but with the whole Arab world\". \"After we all saw live on television Israeli missiles raining houses of innocent Palestinian civilians, we can only expect an escalation of violence by angry people all over the Arab world, regardless of the stands of their governments and their appeals for calm.\" Useful links Yasser Arafat's office Ehud Barak's office Israeli government Palestinian National Authority Egyptian presidency",

      "body": "<b> Linda Jenkins</b>, 50, Retired secretary from Didsbury <br> I was in a pub in Didsbury called the Barley Corn when the news came through on the television. Everyone shouted \"Hurrah!\" and I stood up and said, \"How dare you! She's the best thing that ever happened to this country.\" <p>She'd been hounded on the question of Europe for months. People were tired of her handbagging the pro-Europeans, but I said, hit them harder. I felt very sad, like we were losing a national figure whose importance we wouldn't fully appreciate until she had gone. Britain was going to the dogs before she came along. Thatcher and Gorbachev freed a lot of the world and he got a bad deal in the end, too. </p> <p>I'm afraid I never forgave Heseltine for the way he treated her. You realised, that week, how terribly vulnerable she was; that she was, in some sense, an ordinary woman, a mother who had needed to run the family home sternly. </p> <p><b> Ken Loach</b>, 64, Film director <br> I was in a car going back to a flat we've got in Chiswick. I remember it must have been how people felt at the end of the war - street parties and people singing songs to a piano in the street. I knew the malign influence would carry on, but there was a wonderful feeling of caps in the air. </p> <p><b> Posy Simmonds</b>, 55, Illustrator from London <br> I had been out to lunch that afternoon and was slightly merry as it had been a long one. I did feel guilty though, as I should have been in the studio working that afternoon, which I set about doing in the evening. It wasn't until I was sitting at my desk feeling guilty and merry that I heard the news on the radio. My sentiments were of both surprise and rejoicing - which led to me upsetting the paint water on my desk. </p> <p><b> Andrew De Rosa</b>, 39, Manchester city council worker <br> I was driving along the Embankment in London, coming out of Chelsea. I was the general manager of the Dominion theatre at that time, and was on my way to work. There was a newsflash on the radio and I rang a friend who promptly burst into tears. This was someone who had been on the platform with the lady. We didn't get much done in the office that week. Work stopped. Everyone was shocked. I thought she gave one of the best performances of her career, that week. They had a televised censor motion in the House of Commons and we were glued to it in the office. Thatcher was... serene. </p> <p><b> Norman Tebbit </b>, 69, Ex-Conservative party chairman <br> I knew she was going because I'd been with her late the previous night helping her to write her great resignation speech. In the morning I was at the House of Commons being badgered by colleagues to stand in the election to succeed her. I had two thoughts in mind - three actually: I'd decided to leave front-line politics; by standing I might have let Heseltine in; and the third thought was I'd said quite firmly to a number of people, \"Who in their right mind would want to lead the sort of people that had just overthrown Margaret Thatcher?\" I think I said it in more colourful terms - not suitable for a family newspaper. </p> <p><b> Alan Pearson</b>, 33, Labourer from Hull <br> I remember seeing her crying, and gloating over it. I thought she was making a bloody mess of the country, although she was better than William Hague, who's useless. </p> <p>It wasn't much of a surprise, because I'd thought she was going be pushed out four years before. It was long overdue, because she was all for the rich, and didn't give much for the poor. I had a rich boss then, drove a Rolls-Royce, and I remember he was very arrogant about my opinion of her. He said she was doing good for the country, but she was only doing good for the likes of him. </p> <p><b> Patrick Marber</b> 37, Actor and playwright <br> I was in bed, asleep, in my then girlfriend's flat. She came rushing in and exclaimed, \"Thatcher's gone! She's fucking gone!\" I'm fairly sure she proceeded to dance a merry little jig at the end of the bed. Regarding Mrs Thatcher's demise: I felt joy. And then some pity. And then more joy. </p> <p><b> Lemn Sissay</b>, 33, Poet <br> I was working at a community publishing house in Manchester at the time. I was glad she'd gone, but when she came on the news she suddenly looked like an old lady. There was an initial feeling of pleasure that she was going, and of course she had to go, but then it hit my humanitarian self and I felt sorry for her. Everything that had made her what she was had been taken from her. She was like a grandmother looking back at her children who'd grown up and hated her for what she'd done. </p> <p><b> Tracey Emin</b>, 26, Artist <br> I was walking through Elephant and Castle and I looked up at the buses, and people were banging on the windows and going: \"Yeah!\" And I noticed people were jumping up and down in the street. It was the first sign of the resignation, and people looked so happy. I felt absolute jubilation. </p> <p><b> Peter Tatchell</b>, 48, Gay rights campaigner <br> I was at home making a cup of tea when I turned on the radio and heard the news. For a moment I stood frozen, stunned with disbelief. Then I threw the tea down the sink and poured myself a triple scotch in celebration. After all the years of arrogant leadership, attacks on civil liberties and the crushing of the labour movement, it was a glorious moment when she got her comeuppance. </p> <p>On a personal level I did feel sorry for Mrs Thatcher when she left Downing Street in tears. There's no doubt the way she was treated by her own ministers and MPs was an act of staggering betrayal. She brought them the most successful Tory government of the century and they stabbed her in the back. But politically I could not feel even a whisper of sympathy. Her suffering was nothing compared to the misery her government inflicted on millions of people. </p> <p><b> Mo Shaw</b>, 32, Registrar from Manchester <br> I was an actor back then, and touring with a company called Dodgy Clutch. We were doing a production of An Elephant Called Slowly in Hexham. We were in the hotel bar, watching the telly, when the news broke. I thought, \"Oh, brilliant.\" I was the only one taking much of an interest; no one else was bothered. </p> <p><b> Carol Thatcher</b>, 47, Daughter and writer <br> I did actually know that my mother was planning to resign the night before. After 10 years you always wonder how it's going to end - and I don't think anyone foresaw it would end like that - but once you're in it you're in it, and there's not much you can do about it. I remember saying to Mum: \"Welcome to the freelance club.\" I think that it was not until she walked out for the last time that it became real. I was at my home in Fulham when it was announced, and I remember being very practical about it. I had organised for a bunch of people to come for supper and they started to phone and ask if they should come, and I said yes of course you must come. </p> <p><b> Lauren Booth</b>, 32, Journalist <br> I know exactly where I was, and the very second I was told. I was in Australia in a pub, and one of the guys came in and said, \"Oh, have you heard, Margaret Thatcher has been kicked out?\" And my boyfriend, now husband, just looked at me and said, \"No way!\" We just went berserk. We bought the whole place drinks and were up until 2am; they thought we were mad. It was as if we had won the World Cup. Our only sadness was that we weren't there to witness the tears. </p> <p>When she left it felt like the wicked witch of the West had been got rid of, because it had felt like she was absolutely indestructible. I had sat up for three successive elections and almost given up hope. </p> <p><b> Margaret Bairstow</b>, Pensioner from Preston <br> I was sitting at home watching the television and I was shocked by the way she had been treated. My husband was gloating, and still is, but all I could think of was what a great time of change we were entering, and how uncertain the future was. I thought she was treated very unfairly. She didn't deserve to be pushed out like that after the service she'd given to the country. </p> <p><b> Katie Hickman</b>, Author <br> I was travelling around Mexico with a circus, doing the research for what became my book Travels with a Circus. I tried to tune in to the BBC World Service to hear what Mrs T was going to do, but the reception was too bad, so I listened to Mexican radio, in company with members of the circus - and was very amused by their completely amazed reaction to the news that the person who was to take over from Mrs T, John Major, was the son of a circus performer - they couldn't talk about anything else. </p> <p><b> Ian McEwan</b>, 52, Novelist <br> I was being interviewed by a foreign - maybe Danish - television company in a hotel near the Tower of London. Her picture came up on a television monitor and I stopped the interview and turned up the volume. I felt a certain grim satisfaction, but the film crew were unimpressed by the news and a little dismissive. They provided a useful perspective. It wasn't the end of an era. </p> <p><b> Dr AC Grayling</b>, 52, Academic and writer <br> I was at home, glued avidly to the television, and when she announced that she was going I went delirious with joy and literally danced about the room. Subsequent footage of her biting her lip and wiping away tears as she was chauffered from 10 Downing Street did nothing to soften me: I saw in those tears a contemptibly self-regarding and very pale reflection of the anxiety, difficulty, and often real suffering of the millions who lost jobs, opportunities, local libraries, the protection of a caring society, their homes when mortgages went through the roof, or their chance of a home when council houses were sold off - and much besides. In short, I thought only of the cost of her \"no such thing as society\" war on human lives in the name of market economics, and rejoiced mightily that the lecturing, hectoring, callous succuba had been forced to go at last. A very good riddance! </p> <p><b> Charlie Whelan</b>, 46, Journalist <br> I was in my office at the Engineering Union and a friend of mine rang me from the Press Association, and I thought \"Great!\" Then I thought, \"Oh no. It means we're going to have more of the Tories.\" </p> <p><b> Oona King</b>, 33, Labour MP <br> I remember exactly what I was doing, exactly. I was tapping into a VDU screen in Vauxhall, because I was working as a VDU operator, and the tea trolley woman came round at 9.30am and said, \"Margaret Thatcher has resigned.\" Everyone said, \"Really, oh, goodness,\" and went back to tapping, but I said to my boss, \"I have to go to Downing Street.\" She wouldn't let me leave until my lunchbreak, so I took my lunch at 9.30am. I ran from Vauxhall to Downing Street just to see it happening. It was the next morning, I think, when she actually left. I made a poster - the only poster I have ever made, and I still have it at home - and it said: \"I am 23 years old and I have waited exactly half my life for today. Goodbye Maggie.\" I was so happy that that woman was not going to be prime minister any more. </p> <p><b> Barrie Rutter</b>, 53, Theatre producer <br> I had the drinks laid out in preparation. And then the news came through and I couldn't drink them, because I had to go and pick the kids up from school. I was frustrated until the evening. I wanted to see the old cow go, massively. As soon as I woke up the next morning with a hangover, though, my regret was that a lot of what she had put in place would remain and come back to haunt us - which it has with Railtrack, because she led the privatisation initiative. A lot of her minions are still in place. </p> <p>I didn't feel sympathy for her when she came out of Downing Street. Like a lot of other people, I screamed at the television, \"Suffer, baby, suffer.\" I have respect for her, in certain ways - who hasn't? - but she has nothing in her that represents human charm. </p> <p><b> Joyce Quarry</b>, 50, Publisher from east London <br> It was my 40th birthday present, that was! I can't remember exactly where I was. I had some wonderful 40th birthday presents, but that was the best. I just remember feeling extremely happy. I think it meant a return to human values. I felt the Iron Maiden title suited her very well, because I thought she had very little emotion and very little compassion, and I hoped that we would see a return to values. </p> <p><b> Anthony Wilson</b>, 50, Founder of Factory Records <br> My prime memory was of cheering Peter York on the Late Show. It made the Late Show worthwhile. He called her a Maoist. I remember he did a wonderful thing with his hands, he said, \"Whenever she saw an organisation,\" and then he stretched out his arms as if to indicate the building they were in, \"she pulled it down.\" Another thing I wonder is how many lefties - and I'm a lefty - look back now with misty eyes on the enterprise allowance scheme, that great nurturer of the young. </p> <p><b> Jack Jones</b>, 87, Pensioners leader <br> I was very pleased of course. It was clear she was out of favour, and I wasn't all that enamoured of the Tory party. From the point of view of pensioners and Britain in general, she was an absolute disaster. But I didn't think of it as a new start, because all the traditions she had and all the people around her were still in place. Thatcher's end didn't mean the end of Thatcherism - we're still suffering from it now. </p> <p><b> Harriet Harman</b>, 50, Labour MP <br> Firstly I felt delighted that someone who'd done so much damage had come unstuck. Then hard on the heels of that came the realisation that it might save the Tories from damage. I was in the House of Commons when I heard, walking from one end of the committee corridor to the other, and I bumped into a crowd of Tory MPs. They were outside the office where the vote was being counted. They were all jubilating, and I joined them momentarily until I realised that a change in the Conservative leadership might cost us the next election. </p> <p><b> Faith Brown</b>, 53, Comic <br> I was at the BBC and was doing a sketch at the time as Mrs Thatcher. It was funny because I had delivered this line, \"I may have my faults, but being wrong isn't one of them.\" How ironic. My heart sank when I heard the news, because I did a lot of work as Thatcher. Thank God I have other people that I can do. Though I still do her quite a lot in America. She's still very popular there. I was a great admirer of Thatcher, and I think she had a bit of a raw deal, to be honest. She was great when she first started, but then I think she started to believe her own publicity. By the end she was starting to resemble her own parody. </p> <p><b> Steve Bell</b>, 49, Cartoonist <br> I was sitting at my desk at home doing something or other, and somebody from the Grauniad rang up and said, \"Did you know, she's gone, she's resigned,\" and I said, \"Oh wonderful.\" Later on they asked me to do a drawing about it. I remember because it was one of the first big political drawings I did for the Guardian. It was of her being carried on a pole by Heseltine, Hurd and Major, in the guise of crocodiles. I didn't worry about life getting less colourful. I was so glad to hear that she had gone, the old cow. I had been drawing her for 10 years, longer than that, and you can only go on saying the same thing about someone for so long. </p> <p>I was bemused by John Major, I remember that. I didn't know anything about him. But I had drawn him at a party conference a few weeks before and the thing I noticed was the amazing prehensile upper lip. </p> <p><b> Lord Tim Bell</b>, 59, Former Thatcher adviser <br> I was at a dinner party in Hampstead with Mark Thatcher and Nick Lloyd [the editor of the Express] when I heard. It was the night before the official announcement and I left the party and went straight to Downing Street. I couldn't tell anyone why as it was still a secret. I felt devastated. It was the end of an era. None of us had wanted her to resign and it was devastating to realise she had made that decision. I don't know how to explain what was going through my mind. It was a terrible end to a fantastic period of government, and it left you wondering what was going to happen next. The next day in the office, there was a great deal of gloom and sadness and anger at how stupid the Conservative party was to have done this. </p> <p><b> Glenda Jackson</b>, 64, Labour MP <br> To the second, to the minute. I remember it was thrilling. I'm living the joy of it even as I'm speaking to you. I had to be on parliament green, for some charity thing. I came up on the tube and the London Evening Standard was on the street and the front page was SHE'S GONE in huge capitals, and a photo of herself. So I opened the paper and was reading it as I walked along the platform, chortling all the way. Coming towards me were a group of grannnies down from the north on a day trip, I assume. One of them looked at my Standard and said, \"Is it true, is it true?\" and I said, \"Yes, it must be,\" and she said, \"She's gone, she's gone,\" and they all start cheering. At which point the Queen Mother drives past and they turn from cheering at Margaret having gone to cheering and waving at the Queen Mother. Just heaven. Glorious. It was was worth the 11 years just to have that. Well maybe not. </p> <p><b> Jake Fior</b>, 36, Bookshop owner from London <br> I was working in Camden, selling books from home. I can't remember very much, apart from relief that the woman had finally gone. She didn't go without a bit of a fight, did she? There was a kind of a rearguard action from the Tory grandees which actually got rid of her as I remember. I was very pleased. She'd single-handedly kind of destroyed most of the elements that I admired in this country, and I was very glad to see the back of her. I think hers was the most corrupt government actually, because she had such a majority for such a long time, they'd really become very blase. </p> <p><b> Peter Hitchens</b>, 49, Writer <br> I was in my flat in Moscow, where I was a correspondent for the Express. I can't remember if I heard the news on the World Service or in a phonecall from the desk. I was very surprised but I was much more worried about what was happening in the Soviet Union at the time and had been immersed in Russian politics for about 18 months. British politics seemed rather trivial in comparison. It certainly wasn't a Kennedy-esque moment and I don't remember feeling particularly sad. </p> <p><b> Jeremy Brill</b>, 40, London music shop owner <br> I was working in Peckham, because I was a teacher there at the time, and someone came and told me over the fence. What did I do at that moment? I think I whooped with some great excitement! I think there was much whooping. Whooping combined with disbelief really. I just thought \"God, it's about time. Why's it taken so long?\" </p> <p>\u0095 Interviews by Esther Addley, Laura Barton, Emma Brockes, Simon Hattenstone, Angelique Chrisafis and Annalena McAfee</p>",

Like a lot of other people, I screamed at the television, \"Suffer, baby, suffer.\" I have respect for her, in certain ways - who hasn't? - but she has nothing in her that represents human charm. Joyce Quarry, 50, Publisher from east London It was my 40th birthday present, that was! I can't remember exactly where I was. I had some wonderful 40th birthday presents, but that was the best. I just remember feeling extremely happy. I think it meant a return to human values. I felt the Iron Maiden title suited her very well, because I thought she had very little emotion and very little compassion, and I hoped that we would see a return to values. Anthony Wilson, 50, Founder of Factory Records My prime memory was of cheering Peter York on the Late Show. It made the Late Show worthwhile. He called her a Maoist. I remember he did a wonderful thing with his hands, he said, \"Whenever she saw an organisation,\" and then he stretched out his arms as if to indicate the building they were in, \"she pulled it down.\" Another thing I wonder is how many lefties - and I'm a lefty - look back now with misty eyes on the enterprise allowance scheme, that great nurturer of the young. Jack Jones, 87, Pensioners leader I was very pleased of course. It was clear she was out of favour, and I wasn't all that enamoured of the Tory party. From the point of view of pensioners and Britain in general, she was an absolute disaster. But I didn't think of it as a new start, because all the traditions she had and all the people around her were still in place. Thatcher's end didn't mean the end of Thatcherism - we're still suffering from it now. Harriet Harman, 50, Labour MP Firstly I felt delighted that someone who'd done so much damage had come unstuck. Then hard on the heels of that came the realisation that it might save the Tories from damage. I was in the House of Commons when I heard, walking from one end of the committee corridor to the other, and I bumped into a crowd of Tory MPs. They were outside the office where the vote was being counted. They were all jubilating, and I joined them momentarily until I realised that a change in the Conservative leadership might cost us the next election. Faith Brown, 53, Comic I was at the BBC and was doing a sketch at the time as Mrs Thatcher. It was funny because I had delivered this line, \"I may have my faults, but being wrong isn't one of them.\" How ironic. My heart sank when I heard the news, because I did a lot of work as Thatcher. Thank God I have other people that I can do. Though I still do her quite a lot in America. She's still very popular there. I was a great admirer of Thatcher, and I think she had a bit of a raw deal, to be honest. She was great when she first started, but then I think she started to believe her own publicity. By the end she was starting to resemble her own parody. Steve Bell, 49, Cartoonist I was sitting at my desk at home doing something or other, and somebody from the Grauniad rang up and said, \"Did you know, she's gone, she's resigned,\" and I said, \"Oh wonderful.\" Later on they asked me to do a drawing about it. I remember because it was one of the first big political drawings I did for the Guardian. It was of her being carried on a pole by Heseltine, Hurd and Major, in the guise of crocodiles. I didn't worry about life getting less colourful. I was so glad to hear that she had gone, the old cow. I had been drawing her for 10 years, longer than that, and you can only go on saying the same thing about someone for so long. I was bemused by John Major, I remember that. I didn't know anything about him. But I had drawn him at a party conference a few weeks before and the thing I noticed was the amazing prehensile upper lip. Lord Tim Bell, 59, Former Thatcher adviser I was at a dinner party in Hampstead with Mark Thatcher and Nick Lloyd [the editor of the Express] when I heard. It was the night before the official announcement and I left the party and went straight to Downing Street. I couldn't tell anyone why as it was still a secret. I felt devastated. It was the end of an era. None of us had wanted her to resign and it was devastating to realise she had made that decision. I don't know how to explain what was going through my mind. It was a terrible end to a fantastic period of government, and it left you wondering what was going to happen next. The next day in the office, there was a great deal of gloom and sadness and anger at how stupid the Conservative party was to have done this. Glenda Jackson, 64, Labour MP To the second, to the minute. I remember it was thrilling. I'm living the joy of it even as I'm speaking to you. I had to be on parliament green, for some charity thing. I came up on the tube and the London Evening Standard was on the street and the front page was SHE'S GONE in huge capitals, and a photo of herself. So I opened the paper and was reading it as I walked along the platform, chortling all the way. Coming towards me were a group of grannnies down from the north on a day trip, I assume. One of them looked at my Standard and said, \"Is it true, is it true?\" and I said, \"Yes, it must be,\" and she said, \"She's gone, she's gone,\" and they all start cheering. At which point the Queen Mother drives past and they turn from cheering at Margaret having gone to cheering and waving at the Queen Mother. Just heaven. Glorious. It was was worth the 11 years just to have that. Well maybe not. Jake Fior, 36, Bookshop owner from London I was working in Camden, selling books from home. I can't remember very much, apart from relief that the woman had finally gone. She didn't go without a bit of a fight, did she? There was a kind of a rearguard action from the Tory grandees which actually got rid of her as I remember. I was very pleased. She'd single-handedly kind of destroyed most of the elements that I admired in this country, and I was very glad to see the back of her. I think hers was the most corrupt government actually, because she had such a majority for such a long time, they'd really become very blase. Peter Hitchens, 49, Writer I was in my flat in Moscow, where I was a correspondent for the Express. I can't remember if I heard the news on the World Service or in a phonecall from the desk. I was very surprised but I was much more worried about what was happening in the Soviet Union at the time and had been immersed in Russian politics for about 18 months. British politics seemed rather trivial in comparison. It certainly wasn't a Kennedy-esque moment and I don't remember feeling particularly sad. Jeremy Brill, 40, London music shop owner I was working in Peckham, because I was a teacher there at the time, and someone came and told me over the fence. What did I do at that moment? I think I whooped with some great excitement! I think there was much whooping. Whooping combined with disbelief really. I just thought \"God, it's about time. Why's it taken so long?\" \u0095 Interviews by Esther Addley, Laura Barton, Emma Brockes, Simon Hattenstone, Angelique Chrisafis and Annalena McAfee",

Not because of that aggravating theme tune (the aural equivalent of having half-chewed, week-old Battenburg cake dribbled into your ear canal by a senile grandparent), but because of the bothersome antics of Weatherfield's number one bad guy, Jez Quigley - a seriously unpleasant cross between John \"Cold Feet\" Thomson and the head Blue Meanie from Yellow Submarine. </p> <p>The majority of complaints were provoked by a scene in which Quigley attempted to smother Street wideboy Steve McDonald as he lay injured in hospital. Having been confronted with some genuine menace for once, as opposed to the Street's usual pantomime whimsy, a bunch of easily rattled simpletons phoned the ITC in protest. The regulator agreed that, yes, it was all a bit unpleasant wasn't it? Foul Mr Quigley had appeared to \"enjoy\" inflicting pain, and that simply wouldn't do. </p> <p>Well, look, he was hurting Steve McDonald for God's sake - an oily, opportunistic skunk so astoundingly unsympathetic that an arthritic priest would can-can for joy at the news of his violent death. </p> <p>The main thrust of the ITC's condemnation was that Quigley's lurid display of sadistic nastiness might have upset the show's younger viewers - presumably they'll go on to declare that in future, all fictional drug-dealing villains should be played by one of the Chuckle Brothers, in order to lessen any potential trauma. </p> <p>Still, out of many millions of viewers, only four actually complained, while the rest gawped on in pleasure, drowsily spooning mouthfuls of congealing bolognese into their glistening chops while Quigley eventually sputtered his last, courtesy of a broken rib poking through his lung. </p> <p>With any luck the success of this unusually bleak Street story line will encourage Granada to crank up the show's violence quota considerably, turning it into something akin to an Alan Bennett adaptation of Fight Club. Even the sponsorship stings could join in the fray: whose heart could fail to be lightened by a sequence in which one of those cheery Cadbury's chocolate proles unexpectedly plunges a shortbread screwdriver into a co-worker's forehead, then jigs with delight as the caramel brains ooze out to slap messily against the marshmallow cobblestones? Well? </p> <p>If the Street fails to capitalise on its gore-spattered lead, the remaining soaps should seize the initiative and usher back in a golden age of needless violence. Remember Dynasty's machine-gun massacre? Brookside's Jordache stabbing? We deserve to see their like again. </p> <p>EastEnders should try harder. For starters, they can forget about supposed arch-baddie Nick Cotton. The man simply isn't menacing; he's half as terrifying as an Argos catalogue. Whereas Jez Quigley looked as though he'd enjoy riding an onyx stallion through a field full of groaning, recently-impaled victims before galloping home to bathe in the blood of the fallen, Nick Cotton merely looks like he might, at a push, dispute the price of a dented tin of custard with a supermarket checkout girl while you wait behind him, won dering when he last washed his hair. </p> <p>Here's what they should do: with a nod to the recent box-office success of Gladiator, they should dig up that drab little garden in the centre of Albert Square and replace it with an immense coliseum in which Walford residents settle their differences. Phil Mitchell is no Russell Crowe, but what a thrill it would be to watch him mercilessly pursuing Sonia around a sand-filled arena, frantically twirling a mace. They could take bets on the BBC website, and donate the proceeds to Children In Need: I'll have a tenner on Barry Evans (trident, net) versus Beppe (twin daggers, shield). And Roy could make an excellent thumbs-up / thumbs-down Caesar figure, although you'd have to shield your eyes if he turned round suddenly and his toga rode up. </p> <p>Speaking of togas, our soaps could do with more naked flesh too. Sex-crazed Hollyoaks (aka S Club 7 Street) is currently the market leader - it's like watching a group of aroused, anatomically-correct Chapman Brothers dummies jostling in a tube carriage. It recently featured an entirely implausible naturist swimming club, and now both Brookside and EastEnders are to follow, showcasing special \"nudity\" subplots. Albert Square is set to be rocked by plans for a nude calendar shoot of Queen Vic regulars. </p> <p>If you're reading this while eating, you'll be delighted to learn the April page features a blistering close-up of a full-frontal Ian Beale sprawling open-legged on a leather sofa. Not really. Still, thank your lucky stars Ethel's dead, or they might have crowned her Miss July. Then again, they still might.</p>",

Well, look, he was hurting Steve McDonald for God's sake - an oily, opportunistic skunk so astoundingly unsympathetic that an arthritic priest would can-can for joy at the news of his violent death. The main thrust of the ITC's condemnation was that Quigley's lurid display of sadistic nastiness might have upset the show's younger viewers - presumably they'll go on to declare that in future, all fictional drug-dealing villains should be played by one of the Chuckle Brothers, in order to lessen any potential trauma. Still, out of many millions of viewers, only four actually complained, while the rest gawped on in pleasure, drowsily spooning mouthfuls of congealing bolognese into their glistening chops while Quigley eventually sputtered his last, courtesy of a broken rib poking through his lung. With any luck the success of this unusually bleak Street story line will encourage Granada to crank up the show's violence quota considerably, turning it into something akin to an Alan Bennett adaptation of Fight Club. Even the sponsorship stings could join in the fray: whose heart could fail to be lightened by a sequence in which one of those cheery Cadbury's chocolate proles unexpectedly plunges a shortbread screwdriver into a co-worker's forehead, then jigs with delight as the caramel brains ooze out to slap messily against the marshmallow cobblestones? Well? If the Street fails to capitalise on its gore-spattered lead, the remaining soaps should seize the initiative and usher back in a golden age of needless violence. Remember Dynasty's machine-gun massacre? Brookside's Jordache stabbing? We deserve to see their like again. EastEnders should try harder. For starters, they can forget about supposed arch-baddie Nick Cotton. The man simply isn't menacing; he's half as terrifying as an Argos catalogue. Whereas Jez Quigley looked as though he'd enjoy riding an onyx stallion through a field full of groaning, recently-impaled victims before galloping home to bathe in the blood of the fallen, Nick Cotton merely looks like he might, at a push, dispute the price of a dented tin of custard with a supermarket checkout girl while you wait behind him, won dering when he last washed his hair. Here's what they should do: with a nod to the recent box-office success of Gladiator, they should dig up that drab little garden in the centre of Albert Square and replace it with an immense coliseum in which Walford residents settle their differences. Phil Mitchell is no Russell Crowe, but what a thrill it would be to watch him mercilessly pursuing Sonia around a sand-filled arena, frantically twirling a mace. They could take bets on the BBC website, and donate the proceeds to Children In Need: I'll have a tenner on Barry Evans (trident, net) versus Beppe (twin daggers, shield). And Roy could make an excellent thumbs-up / thumbs-down Caesar figure, although you'd have to shield your eyes if he turned round suddenly and his toga rode up. Speaking of togas, our soaps could do with more naked flesh too. Sex-crazed Hollyoaks (aka S Club 7 Street) is currently the market leader - it's like watching a group of aroused, anatomically-correct Chapman Brothers dummies jostling in a tube carriage. It recently featured an entirely implausible naturist swimming club, and now both Brookside and EastEnders are to follow, showcasing special \"nudity\" subplots. Albert Square is set to be rocked by plans for a nude calendar shoot of Queen Vic regulars. If you're reading this while eating, you'll be delighted to learn the April page features a blistering close-up of a full-frontal Ian Beale sprawling open-legged on a leather sofa. Not really. Still, thank your lucky stars Ethel's dead, or they might have crowned her Miss July. Then again, they still might.",

So exciting are this lot, they make The House Of Eliot look like The Playboy Mansion. </p> <p>In a tangentially related incident, <strong> Hidden Love</strong> (Channel 4) was all about women's relationships with their vibrators. You might not think that such a relationship needed an hour to explain - switch it on and slide it in! (or vice versa) - but that's where you'd be wrong. Ladies have complex connections to their little, and often not so little, battery operated friends, and Hidden Love did its best to explore them without getting all Channel 5.

A bit like bridges in Cold War movies where the Americans and the Russians swap spies, the contact centres act as neutral ground for one parent to bring children to see the other without them having to see their ex-partner. </p> <p>Weaving Carole's own emotional story with that of the centre users, Everyman was a mature, engaging piece of television which didn't invite judgment or resort to emotional manipulation. With tales like Carole's, and that of the Hargraves family, it was eloquent and honest, and an invitation to further discussion of the difficulties of children from \"broken homes\". </p> <p>The Hargraves were in a very difficult, but by no means unusual situation. A heavy-drinking father with a history of violence, Keith was only allowed to see two of his daughters, Juliette and Katherine, at the centre.

He didn't think that him headbutting his other daughter, Joanne, giving her two black eyes during a fight with Audrey should make a difference since \"it was a one-off incident\".

Only if they returned for a training session at 11am today would they be considered for selection for the match at Twickenham, for which around 60,000 tickets have been sold. If they do not, he promises to put together a side from whatever resources are available to him.</p> <p>At yesterday's press conference, Woodward said he felt \"betrayed\" by players with whom he has worked for the past three years and who, after capturing last season's Six Nations championship, beat Australia, the world champions, last Saturday. \"The players had my full support,\" he said. \"I don't think they were being greedy. But after seeing the offer, I can't believe they haven't accepted it.\"</p> <p>He was particularly critical of \"three or four strong characters\" among the senior players. \"They've made a huge mistake,\" he said. \"A lot of the younger guys will be driving home now, panicking and wondering what the hell they've just done.\"</p> <p>Most of the squad had already left the Pennyhill Park hotel, Bagshot, when an ad hoc committee consisting of three senior players - the present captain, Martin Johnson, and two of his predecessors, Lawrence Dallaglio and Matt Dawson - emerged into the courtyard.

      "bodyText": "The final act in the protracted and painful transformation of English rugby union from the preserve of Barboured amateurs into a fully professional business controlled by agents and lawyers took place in a Surrey country club yesterday, when the entire England squad went on strike over a contract dispute and were ordered to pack their bags and go home. After their coach, Clive Woodward, heard that the squad had voted unanimously in a secret ballot to reject the latest pay offer from the Rugby Football Union, and would be withdrawing from Saturday's match against Argentina, he told all 22 players to leave the team's headquarters and to spend the night examining their consciences. Only if they returned for a training session at 11am today would they be considered for selection for the match at Twickenham, for which around 60,000 tickets have been sold. If they do not, he promises to put together a side from whatever resources are available to him. At yesterday's press conference, Woodward said he felt \"betrayed\" by players with whom he has worked for the past three years and who, after capturing last season's Six Nations championship, beat Australia, the world champions, last Saturday. \"The players had my full support,\" he said. \"I don't think they were being greedy. But after seeing the offer, I can't believe they haven't accepted it.\" He was particularly critical of \"three or four strong characters\" among the senior players. \"They've made a huge mistake,\" he said. \"A lot of the younger guys will be driving home now, panicking and wondering what the hell they've just done.\" Most of the squad had already left the Pennyhill Park hotel, Bagshot, when an ad hoc committee consisting of three senior players - the present captain, Martin Johnson, and two of his predecessors, Lawrence Dallaglio and Matt Dawson - emerged into the courtyard. Accompanied by Alan Edwards, a PR man better known for advising the Rolling Stones and the Spice Girls, they put their side of the argument to reporters who had gathered expecting to hear nothing more exciting than Woodward's team selection for Saturday's match. Instead the journalists were witnessing the apparent meltdown of the one area in which rugby union, riven in recent years by the stresses imposed by the sudden influx of money from satellite television, had retained its unity. At the heart of the dispute is a disagreement over the complicated formula determining the balance between fixed match fees and win bonuses stipulated by the four-year deal. Although neither side would be precise about figures, the RFU is offering a split under which the players would earn about \u00a365,000 for winning all this season's eight matches, plus a top-up bonus, and about \u00a325,000 for losing them all.

Added to all this, for the international players, is a system of payments for intellectual property rights - in other words, for the use of their images as part of sponsorship and advertising deals. This, the RFU say, is expected to swell the players' pot by up to \u00a32m over the four years of the deal. Johnson read a prepared statement in which the players were highly critical of the way in which the negotiations, described as \"frustrating and inconclusive\", had been conducted by the \"old-fashioned, patronising and arrogant\" RFU, and in particular its chief executive, Francis Baron. Principle \"The issue from the players' side is one of principle,\" Johnson said, \"and their main drive is to bring the sport into the 21st century, and ensure that as performers they get something approaching a fair deal to bring them in line with other sports.

Today it is in crisis, with the England squad refusing to train unless its demands for better pay are met by the Rugby Football Union. If they don't train they will not be selected for Saturday's match against Argentina. The players' clubs may have colluded, and it is possible that the replacement players will refuse to turn out too. If you are going to the match at the weekend, it might be advisable to take some kit.</p> <p>A decade ago, rugby was one of the last redoubts of amateurism (or, more often, \"shamateurism\", with players getting undeclared payments for playing but retaining their amateur status). It was a sociable sport, and the game's current administrators have little sympathy for the cash consciousness of today's players, who have been carried along on the tide of professionalism which has swept over the sport.

      "bodyText": "Last Saturday English rugby was exultant, after a last-gasp victory over the mighty Australians, champions of the world. Today it is in crisis, with the England squad refusing to train unless its demands for better pay are met by the Rugby Football Union. If they don't train they will not be selected for Saturday's match against Argentina. The players' clubs may have colluded, and it is possible that the replacement players will refuse to turn out too. If you are going to the match at the weekend, it might be advisable to take some kit. A decade ago, rugby was one of the last redoubts of amateurism (or, more often, \"shamateurism\", with players getting undeclared payments for playing but retaining their amateur status). It was a sociable sport, and the game's current administrators have little sympathy for the cash consciousness of today's players, who have been carried along on the tide of professionalism which has swept over the sport. Fran Cotton, the stalwart old prop forward who is now chairman of Club England, will have spoken for many yesterday when he castigated the players' greed. \"Playing for your country should be regarded as the pinnacle of a player's career,\" said Cotton. The England players are unhappy with a bonus-based pay deal worth an annual \u00a370,000 per player, and compared with the money earned by, say, golfers, they have a point.

Mr Amess feels that too many youngsters are buying small furry animals and then not caring for them.</p> <p>Listening to Mr Amess speak is like being trapped on a crowded train with an apparently amiable stranger. He starts talking and you think, well, I suppose I agree with most of that. Then you realise that his use of the English language is a little curious, even irritating. \"I'm reliably informed that Christmas is still on December 25, unless that's something else that has been modernised!\" he said with a misguided attempt at jocularity.</p> <p>\"There is a considerable attraction among the general public to purchase animals and particularly small animals. While there might be no attraction among the public in terms of their endearment to small MPs, there undoubtedly is a real attraction to the ownership of kittens, puppies and suchlike.\"</p> <p>You're trying to pick the bones out of that when he gets slightly more personal. \"The Amess household owns a great variety of pets,\" he says, and you realise to your horror that he is going to tell you about them all, possibly accompanied by photos.</p> <p>\"We have a black labrador, which is described as 'wayward', though I suppose it's not the only thing in the Amess household which can be described as wayward!\" Ha, a joke, you think, and you manage to force your face into a courteous but very thin smile.</p> <p>\"Yes,\" he continues in a dreamy voice, \"we have rabbits, hamsters, fish, canaries, finches, and the garden seems to be full of foxes. I can testify that encouraging children to look after all these animals is not always successful, and invariably it's up to mum and dad!\"</p> <p>Now the announcement you've been dreading: \"We apologise for this stoppage, caused by Railtrack speed restrictions and flooding on the line. It looks as if we're in for quite a long delay here ...\"</p> <p>Mr Amess hardly notices. Indeed, the delay encourages him to become more expansive. \"So many of these small furry animals are attractive to children: hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs, rabbits ...\" and you sense that he is not really speaking to you at all, but talking dreamily to him self. \"Yes, teenagers are crazed by these turtles, ur, Teenage Mutant, um, Nurjna Turtles, or whatever it's called. And there's the revival of 101 Dalmatians, everyone's gone out to buy these dalmatians ... and I dare say that with all these dinosaur films on at the moment ...\"</p> <p>Labour MPs who had been wondering when they could politely feign sleep, or death, woke up at that. Surely even Amess didn't imagine that you could buy dinosaurs in a pet shop?</p> <p>\"It'll be iguanas that get purchased, and I suppose with all this publicity about sharks, people will keep baby sharks ...\" I expected a guard to walk up and down the train offering complaints forms. \"No,\" you'd cry, I don't mind being three hours late. Just get rid of this man!\"</p> <p>Nothing would stop him. \"In Barnstaple, north Devon, two chinchillas were dumped on a doorstep after sparking a major row between a boy and girlfriend. The girlfriend had been promised 'something furry for Christmas'.\"</p> <p>At this point, MPs had come through what athletes call \"the wall\". They had reached the other side. The sheer droning tedium had, in some weird way, become hilarious.</p> <p>\"In conclusion ...\" he said, and Labour MPs, by now weak with laughter, shouted at him, \"No, more! More!\"</p> <p>The bill will not become law.</p>",

While there might be no attraction among the public in terms of their endearment to small MPs, there undoubtedly is a real attraction to the ownership of kittens, puppies and suchlike.\" You're trying to pick the bones out of that when he gets slightly more personal. \"The Amess household owns a great variety of pets,\" he says, and you realise to your horror that he is going to tell you about them all, possibly accompanied by photos. \"We have a black labrador, which is described as 'wayward', though I suppose it's not the only thing in the Amess household which can be described as wayward!\" Ha, a joke, you think, and you manage to force your face into a courteous but very thin smile. \"Yes,\" he continues in a dreamy voice, \"we have rabbits, hamsters, fish, canaries, finches, and the garden seems to be full of foxes. I can testify that encouraging children to look after all these animals is not always successful, and invariably it's up to mum and dad!\" Now the announcement you've been dreading: \"We apologise for this stoppage, caused by Railtrack speed restrictions and flooding on the line. It looks as if we're in for quite a long delay here ...\" Mr Amess hardly notices. Indeed, the delay encourages him to become more expansive. \"So many of these small furry animals are attractive to children: hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs, rabbits ...\" and you sense that he is not really speaking to you at all, but talking dreamily to him self. \"Yes, teenagers are crazed by these turtles, ur, Teenage Mutant, um, Nurjna Turtles, or whatever it's called. And there's the revival of 101 Dalmatians, everyone's gone out to buy these dalmatians ... and I dare say that with all these dinosaur films on at the moment ...\" Labour MPs who had been wondering when they could politely feign sleep, or death, woke up at that. Surely even Amess didn't imagine that you could buy dinosaurs in a pet shop? \"It'll be iguanas that get purchased, and I suppose with all this publicity about sharks, people will keep baby sharks ...\" I expected a guard to walk up and down the train offering complaints forms. \"No,\" you'd cry, I don't mind being three hours late. Just get rid of this man!\" Nothing would stop him. \"In Barnstaple, north Devon, two chinchillas were dumped on a doorstep after sparking a major row between a boy and girlfriend. The girlfriend had been promised 'something furry for Christmas'.\" At this point, MPs had come through what athletes call \"the wall\". They had reached the other side. The sheer droning tedium had, in some weird way, become hilarious. \"In conclusion ...\" he said, and Labour MPs, by now weak with laughter, shouted at him, \"No, more! More!\" The bill will not become law.",

For these charges to succeed, according to Robert Black QC, the Edinburgh law professor who proposed the trial at a neutral venue, the prosecution must prove the bomb which blew up Pan Am flight 103 began its journey in Malta. Prosecution lawyers had barely sat down after completing their case before Professor Black was warning they had not succeeded in the fundamentals of their task.</p> <p>\"Unless I have missed something, and I do not think I have, there is a gaping hole at the centre of the crown's case,\" he said. \"It is an absolutely crucial element in all the three charges that the suitcase containing the bomb started in Malta.

Lord Sutherland yesterday granted a request from Richard Keen QC, counsel for Fhimah, for a one week adjournment. On Tuesday Mr Keen will begin his \"no case to answer\" submission. If he is successful, half of the trial will come crashing down.</p> <p><b>Repercussions</b></p> <p>The chances of Mr Keen's success depend on the weight of evidence stacked against his client. The credibility of key prosecution witnesses may have been destroyed in cross examination, but such things are beyond the judge's consideration.</p> <p>Although the route which brought them to Camp Zeist is complex, the charges faced by the Libyans rely on a few simple premises. Megrahi and Fhimah are alleged to have been members of the JSO, the Libyan intelligence service, who worked under cover in the offices of Libyan Arab Airlines at Malta's Luqa airport. On December 21 1988, the prosecution claims, the pair planted a bomb which was contained within a radio cassette recorder in a Samsonite suitcase and loaded it on an Air Malta plane at Frankfurt airport.</p> <p>The crown says that suitcase was transferred on to Pan Am flight 103. A few hours later the jumbo blew up over Lockerbie, killing all 259 passengers and crew on board and 11 people on the ground. It is a neat scenario, but it is far from certain the judges will agree that the crown has proved it is accurate.</p> <p>The trial of Megrahi, the co-accused, is destined to continue until his defence has been fully heard. William Taylor QC, counsel for Megrahi, yesterday asked for an adjournment to allow Syria to respond to a court request for the release of a se cret document which claims to offer an alternative explanation of the bombing.</p> <p>Both Megrahi and Fhimah have lodged a special defence of incrimination, blaming Palestinian terrorist groups, including the Damascus-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. If Fhimah's no case to answer plea is successful, his side of the story will never be heard. But, over the next weeks, it is expected that Mr Taylor will advance the scenario first accepted by those investigating the bombing.</p> <p>In the first years of the investigation there was just one working theory. It was believed that the bomb was a revenge attack mounted by the PFLP-GC for the shooting down of an Iranian airbus in the Gulf by the USS Vincennes in July 1988. This theory was ditched around the time of the Gulf war, when America took on Iraq with the acquiescence of Syria and Iran.</p> <p>For special defence to succeed, Mr Taylor, and perhaps Mr Keen, need not prove this scenario accurate. They need only place reasonable doubt over the veracity of the scenario advanced by the crown. Much of the crown's case relies on technical evidence which has gone unreported and unobserved as the trial grinds on in Holland. Yet there have been a few key witnesses - and they have not lived up to expectation.</p> <p>The first of these was Anthony Gauci. This Maltese shop owner was crucial to linking Megrahi to the bomb. When investigators picked through the wreckage of flight 103 they found clothing stained with residue from a Semtex explosion; it was labelled \"Malta Trading Company\". The clothing was sold at Mr Gauci's shop. But, although Mr Gauci said Megrahi resembled a man whom he remembered buying similar clothing before the bombing, he stopped short of full identification.</p> <p>Next came Edwin Bollier, a Swiss businessman whose Zurich-based company, Mebo, is alleged to have made the timer used in the bomb. For years before the trial, Mr Bollier waged an internet campaign denying the timer was supplied by his firm. Under questioning from the prosecution, however, he conceded that it could only have come from Mebo.</p> <p><b>Protection</b><br></p> <p>When Mr Bollier said he supplied such timers solely to Libya, the prosecution's case appeared to receive a boost. But that may have later been dented by the admission that he also supplied timers to the Stasi, the East German security force, who in turn backed Palestinian terrorist organisations.</p> <p>As far as star witnesses are concerned, that left only Abdul Majid Giaka - a Libyan who worked alongside the accused at Luqa airport. Giaka was a double agent: working for the CIA at the same time as the JSO. He defected to the US on the witness protection programme and, as he emerged after 10 years, he told the court Fhimah had shown him explosives in his drawer; he claimed he had once handed Megrahi a report on how to place a bomb on a plane leaving Luqa airport. Finally, in his most crucial piece of evidence, he said he had watched Megrahi and Fhimah take a Samsonite suitcase, flown in from Libya, unaccompanied through customs.</p> <p>But under cross-examination his cred-ibility was tarnished. \"While in America, have you been able to dip into gems of American literature, such as their short-story writers like James Thurber?\" asked Mr Keen. \"Have you encountered someone called Mitty, first name Walter?\"</p> <p><b>Main players in bomb trial</b></p> <p><b>Abdelbaset Al Megrahi</b> <br>One of the accused. He is alleged to have worked undercover for the JSO, the Libyan intelligence agency, as head of security at Libyan Arab Airlines at Malta's Luqa airport. The prosecution says he used this position to plant the bomb on an Air Malta plane which fed on to flight 103 at Frankfurt. He has lodged a special defence of incrimination.</p> <p><b>Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah</b> <br>The co-accused. Like Megrahi, Fhimah is alleged to have been working undercover for the JSO when he worked as station manager at Libyan Arab Airlines.</p> <p><b>Anthony Gauci</b> <br>A Maltese shop owner whom the prosecution claims sold the clothing found in the case which housed the bomb.</p> <p><b>Edwin Bollier</b> <br>A Swiss businessman whose company, Mebo, made the timer which the prosecution say was used in the Lockerbie bomb.</p> <p><b>Abdul Majid Giaka</b> <br>The Libyan supergrass.

But, over the next weeks, it is expected that Mr Taylor will advance the scenario first accepted by those investigating the bombing. In the first years of the investigation there was just one working theory. It was believed that the bomb was a revenge attack mounted by the PFLP-GC for the shooting down of an Iranian airbus in the Gulf by the USS Vincennes in July 1988. This theory was ditched around the time of the Gulf war, when America took on Iraq with the acquiescence of Syria and Iran. For special defence to succeed, Mr Taylor, and perhaps Mr Keen, need not prove this scenario accurate. They need only place reasonable doubt over the veracity of the scenario advanced by the crown. Much of the crown's case relies on technical evidence which has gone unreported and unobserved as the trial grinds on in Holland. Yet there have been a few key witnesses - and they have not lived up to expectation. The first of these was Anthony Gauci. This Maltese shop owner was crucial to linking Megrahi to the bomb. When investigators picked through the wreckage of flight 103 they found clothing stained with residue from a Semtex explosion; it was labelled \"Malta Trading Company\". The clothing was sold at Mr Gauci's shop. But, although Mr Gauci said Megrahi resembled a man whom he remembered buying similar clothing before the bombing, he stopped short of full identification. Next came Edwin Bollier, a Swiss businessman whose Zurich-based company, Mebo, is alleged to have made the timer used in the bomb. For years before the trial, Mr Bollier waged an internet campaign denying the timer was supplied by his firm. Under questioning from the prosecution, however, he conceded that it could only have come from Mebo. Protection When Mr Bollier said he supplied such timers solely to Libya, the prosecution's case appeared to receive a boost. But that may have later been dented by the admission that he also supplied timers to the Stasi, the East German security force, who in turn backed Palestinian terrorist organisations. As far as star witnesses are concerned, that left only Abdul Majid Giaka - a Libyan who worked alongside the accused at Luqa airport. Giaka was a double agent: working for the CIA at the same time as the JSO. He defected to the US on the witness protection programme and, as he emerged after 10 years, he told the court Fhimah had shown him explosives in his drawer; he claimed he had once handed Megrahi a report on how to place a bomb on a plane leaving Luqa airport. Finally, in his most crucial piece of evidence, he said he had watched Megrahi and Fhimah take a Samsonite suitcase, flown in from Libya, unaccompanied through customs. But under cross-examination his cred-ibility was tarnished. \"While in America, have you been able to dip into gems of American literature, such as their short-story writers like James Thurber?\" asked Mr Keen. \"Have you encountered someone called Mitty, first name Walter?\" Main players in bomb trial Abdelbaset Al Megrahi One of the accused. He is alleged to have worked undercover for the JSO, the Libyan intelligence agency, as head of security at Libyan Arab Airlines at Malta's Luqa airport. The prosecution says he used this position to plant the bomb on an Air Malta plane which fed on to flight 103 at Frankfurt. He has lodged a special defence of incrimination. Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah The co-accused. Like Megrahi, Fhimah is alleged to have been working undercover for the JSO when he worked as station manager at Libyan Arab Airlines. Anthony Gauci A Maltese shop owner whom the prosecution claims sold the clothing found in the case which housed the bomb. Edwin Bollier A Swiss businessman whose company, Mebo, made the timer which the prosecution say was used in the Lockerbie bomb. Abdul Majid Giaka The Libyan supergrass. He was a double agent - working for the JSO and the CIA - when he worked with the accused at Luqa airport. Claims to have been shown explosives in Fhimah's desk. Defence portrayed him as a fantasist who made up his testimony to secure a new life in the US.",

She had questioned an expenses bill of less that \u00a35,000 for 22 months of work for Charlotte, challenging bills for mobile phone calls, postal charges, and even a parcel delivery charge of \u00a39.99. \"It was a quite extraordinary and disproportionate response to things like Jiffy bags and the amount he had spent on entertaining at The Ivy [a restaurant in the West End of London],\" said Mr Mill. \"That response was indicative of the focus of the Church family on financial matters.\" Mr Mill said the family was trying to blame the dispute on the manager by raising \"a whole series of allegations of untrue, petty and offensive nature, included with a view to embarrassing Mr Shalit.\" The case continues.",

It found 70% of children born within marriage will live until their 16th birthday with both natural parents, compared with 36% of children born to cohabiting couples. The figures were based on an analysis of a government sample survey of 10,000 British households and the statisticians concluded that the birth of a child made it 60% less likely that a cohabiting couple would marry. \"The temporary nature of many cohabiting relationships means they should not be considered simply as marriage without the vows. \"They are a new and relatively unstable family structure which is leading to a dramatic increase in childbearing outside marriage and significant growth in the time children spend living in one parent families,\" said the au thors, John Ermisch and Marco Francesconi. The study found 70% of first partnerships were cohabitations outside marriage. Typically they lasted two years before the couple either married or separated. About 60% of first cohabitations became marriages and 35% dissolved within 10 years. This pattern had contributed to postponement of the average age of marriage and motherhood. But more women were having children while cohabiting, rising from 2% in 1980 to 22% in 1997. On average, children born to cohabiting couples spent 4.3 years of their childhood with just one parent, compared with 1.7 years for children born within marriages and 6.6 years for children born outside a live-in partnership of any kind. Robert Whelan, of Family and Youth Concern, said: \"Children need to have stable lives and be born within marriage.\" The findings, based on the British Household Panel Survey, are published today in a book, Seven Years in the Lives of British Families.",

Hackney has been a hung council since 1996, however the voting record of the past four years shows clearly that the council was being run by an \"anti-Labour\" coalition of minority parties, of which the Liberal Democrats were the largest and leading component. This coalition introduced the disastrous Transforming Hackney programme in 1997, that devolved financial management to departments without proper central controls, which led to the current crisis. Although the Labour group made its opposition to such policies clear in the council chamber, a stance subsequently vindicated by various auditors and inspectorates, it was consistently out-voted by the Liberal Democrat-led alliance.

It is governed by the Adoption Act 1976, but much of this legislation in fact dates from 1958 - when adoption was chiefly concerned with the placement of babies born to single mothers.</p> <p>Reforms enacted in 1975, and introduced piecemeal until 1988, acknowledged that some older, \"hard-to-place\" children were being adopted. Importantly, local authorities were given the power to pay adoption allowances in cases where children with special needs placed additional financial strains on their adoptive families. </p> <p>Grounds for dispensing with parental agreement to adoption were expanded in an attempt to address the problem of children \"languishing\" in care. The concept of \"freeing for adoption\" was introduced, and was brought into force in 1984. This enabled the court to end the birth parents' rights over the child and to transfer these to the adoption agency.</p> <p>The purpose of this was twofold. First, it aimed to stop the suffering of parents, who wished to relinquish infants for adoption, during delays before the adoption was finalised; and to avoid causing distress to the child and prospective adopters where parents withdrew from their agreement at the last moment. Second, where parents opposed adoption, a freeing application could be used to ask the court, in advance of a decision to place the child with adopters, whether it was appropriate to overrule the parents' opposition.</p> <p>The legislation included only a very limited provision for revoking freeing orders if the child was not actually adopted. Unfortunately, a number of children - freed for adoption, but never adopted - now have as their legal parent only the local authority.</p> <p>The 1975 reforms also attempted to reverse the increase in step-parent adoptions. But, despite an initial reduction, these have continued to represent more than half the adoption orders made. In the event, the specific requirement for the court to prefer a \"joint custody\" or \"custodianship\" order to adoption in such cases was removed by the Children Act 1989.</p> <p>The Children Act was enacted following a thorough review of childcare law - called for by the House of Commons select committee on children in care in relation to concerns raised by the Cleveland inquiry, which occurred after Cleveland council took more than 100 children into care in 1987 on the grounds of suspected sexual abuse. But the opportunity to review adoption law was not taken at the same time, and an interdepartmental review of adoption law was only established as the Children Act was completing its passage through parliament. Despite a number of relatively minor amendments to the Adoption Act 1976, which are contained in the Children Act, adoption law has not kept up with children's legislation.</p> <p>The Children Act requires a court to treat the welfare of any child under its consideration as the \"paramount consideration\". It sets out a useful checklist of factors to be considered in disputed applications, or those involving the local authority. It requires courts to act on the assumption that delay is likely to be harmful to the child's welfare. It explicitly requires local authorities to ascertain and take into consideration the views of children, their parents - including fathers who may not have \"parental responsibility\" - and other people important to the child. Under the Act, local authorities are required to have regard for the child's needs arising from his or her religious persuasion, racial origin and cultural and linguistic background, and to try and keep siblings together wherever possible.</p> <p>All these, as well as a proper means of ensuring that children's views are always made known to the court, are matters that need to be incorporated in a new adoption bill. In addition, the following points need to be addressed.</p> <p>\u0095 Cohabiting couples should be allowed to apply jointly for an adoption order. This would recognise the reality of the situation where a child is placed with two people living together, but not married to each other, who intend to share the parenting role. It would also increase the number of potential adopters.</p> <p>\u0095 There needs to be change in the grounds for dispensing with parental agreement to adoption. This question was thoroughly addressed by the adoption law review. It is hard to better the recommendation, contained in the review's report to ministers, that a parent's consent to adoption should be dispensed with only if the court is satisfied that the advantages of adoption would be so significantly greater for the child than any alternative option as to justify overriding the wishes of the parents.</p> <p>\u0095 \"Freeing for adoption\" should be replaced by a provision that enables the issue of parental consent to be addressed prior to the child's placement for adoption - without ending the child's relationship with his or her birth parents until new, adoptive, parents are able to take their place. Placement orders, as outlined in the March 1996 draft adoption bill, could provide an appropriate framework, with some amendments. </p> <p>\u0095 Local authorities should be given a much stronger and clearer statutory obligation to provide post-adoption support for all those affected by the adoption, including greatly improved and more consistently applied adoption allowances. </p> <p>\u0095 We need to see an adjustment in the definition of the legal status conferred by adoption. While it should remain the case that adoptive parents acquire full parental status from the date of the adoption, the legal fiction that the child was never the child of his or her birth parents should be removed. </p> <p>\u0095 A new order should be introduced to confer guardianship on those caring permanently for a child, without severing all legal relationship with the birth parents. This would be useful in cases where the child is cared for by relatives and in instances where the child is to have a permanent home with current foster carers, but does not wish to lose his or her legal family relationships. </p> <p>\u0095 A similar form of guardianship may be appropriate for some stepfamilies.

Often the harsh approach of public sector officials masks a lack of alternative ideas. So voluntary agencies that use their practical experience of local service delivery and advocacy to propose effective ways to implement broad policy principles may find themselves more valued. Voluntary organisations which approach their funders with confidence about their own community contribution and a quiver full of useful ideas can find that they are gradually accepted as truly equal \"partners\" in the policy implementation game. \u0095 Margaret Harris is professor of voluntary sector organisation at Aston Business School. The book Voluntary Organisations and Social Policy, which she co-edited with Colin Rochester, has just been published by Palgrave (formerly Macmillan).",

It reads: \"In the event of an appeal, all members of the fielding team must maintain their fielding positions until a decision is given, unless legitimately in the act of fielding or backing up the ball which is not yet dead. For the purposes of this playing condition, a referral to the third umpire will constitute a decision.\" </p> <p> The ECB is concerned that excessive appealing is spreading into county cricket from the more intense international game. The new law is also designed to discourage fielders, such as mid-on and mid-off, joining the wicketkeeper and bowler in their appeal. </p> <p> But instead of welcoming the move, some umpires are concerned at the increasing level of responsibility being given to the third official. Ray Julian, who will retire after completing 30 years on the first-class umpires' list next season, said last night: \"The job of the third umpire is now becoming one of the most difficult in the game. And he's paid less than the two officials who are standing. </p> <p> \"It is important that the human element in the game is maintained and that the men in the middle have a greater responsibility than just counting up to six.\" </p> <p> Umpires are also concerned by reports that Channel 4 plans to give its own verdict on appeals next season. It is expected to unofficially uphold more appeals than the umpires, which is expected to put more pressure on the officials. </p> <p> The ECB also moved to improve over rates next season. It is scrapping the old regulation whereby a team is fined for a slow over rate. That has had little effect on the players because the fine is usually picked up by the club or the sponsor. But from next season the ECB will introduce a points fine for teams failing to achieve the required over rates. </p> <p> In its statement the ECB said: \"The Board's Cricket Advisory Committee acknowledged that the current system of fines was not reducing the slow over rates in County Championship cricket. From the 2001 season a system of penalty points will instead be applied for slow over rates, on a match by match basis. </p> <p> \"The minimum over rate for all teams in every match throughout the season will be 16 overs per hour. If a team fails to attain this over rate, calculated over the duration of the match, it will be deducted championship points on the following basis: one over short of the match target, 0.25 points deduction; two overs short of the match target, 0.5 points deduction; three overs short of the match target, 0.75 points deduction etc.\" </p> <p> No allowances will be made for wickets taken or drinks intervals when the over rate is calculated, but any suspension of play for an injury or other reason beyond the control of the players will be a deductible allowance.</p>",

Twenty-one months ago Mark Taylor bequeathed to him the most powerful and attacking team in the world. Waugh retained the daredevil nuts and bolts but extinguished the mortal character flaws; the shakes that crept in when Australia were posed 120 or fewer to win, the careless habit of throwing away meaningless final Tests. Losing became a dirty word. </p> <p>\"This is only the beginning,\" Waugh announced last April after his side had nailed their 10th straight Test win. \"We can play better than that. We're on the verge of something special.\" Tough-talking antipodean arrogance? Or a declaration of serious intent? </p> <p>All will be revealed over the next two weeks. Tomorrow in Brisbane, Waugh's men will set out to equal the 11 wins in a row chalked up by Clive Lloyd's 1984 West Indians. A week later in Perth, they will be overwhelming favourites to shatter a record thought to be as unbreakable as Jim Laker's 19 wickets at Old Trafford or Courtney Walsh's 37 career ducks. And what a place to rewrite history: the Waca, bullring of bounce, paradise of pace, the happiest of Caribbean happy hunting grounds. The diatribe awaiting Jimmy Adams's dire tribe, should they lose, will haunt the Lillee-Marsh stand for years to come. The title of greatest team of the modern era will have been passed on. </p> <p>Well, maybe. Waugh is not going to like this, but there is a compelling argument that his side lack the swagger and menace of Lloyd's laconic lords of '84. </p> <p>Four times out of 11, Lloyd's side triumphed by an innings; Waugh's men have done so twice. West Indies' narrowest wins were by eight wickets and 172 runs; the 2000 Australians have scraped home by four wickets, six wickets (twice) and 62 runs. </p> <p>Eight of West Indies' 11 wins came on foreign soil; Australia have been less unshakeable abroad. West Indies' batsmen averaged 42.17 per wicket; Australia's 41.59. Their bowlers 21.89 runs a scalp; Australia's 23.96. Pedantic considerations maybe, but decisive. </p> <p>Yet there are uncanny parallels. Amid a shelf full of flashing blades, at the forefront of both teams is a stodgy, no-frills left-hander. Larry Gomes nudged 729 runs at 91 during the Windies' run, and Justin Langer - a new-millennium version of Gomes minus the afro - has been Australia's dominant runscorer. </p> <p>Both sides possess precocious counter-punchers in Richie Richardson and Ricky Ponting, ageing masters in Lloyd and Waugh, and underperforming past masters in Viv Richards and Mark Waugh. They also boast the luxury of outstanding batsman-keepers in Jeff Dujon and Adam Gilchrist, and neither team contains a class all-rounder. </p> <p>But in other areas West Indies reign supreme. For openers, Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes form a more brazenly blockbusting duo than Michael Slater and Greg Blewett, who average only 34 for the first wicket. The Windies' mean machine has a distinct edge in quaking hostility. The explosive Brett Lee currently takes a wicket every 32.8 balls - a phenomenal strike-rate. But Malcolm Marshall, whose purplest patch coincided with the Windies' 1984 run, is at least Lee's equal. </p> <p>On paper, Australia's ace card lies on the spin front. Yet the off-spinner Roger Harper played nine of West Indies' 11 Tests, accruing 24 wickets at a better average than Shane Warne has collected his. And he was a phenomenally acrobatic fielder to boot. </p> <p>\"I don't want to upset Steve Waugh too much,\" the former Australia left-hander Neil Harvey opined this year, \"but I don't think his team is as good as Ian Chappell's 1972 side or Richie Benaud's 1958 side, let alone the 1948 side.\" Fans of Bradman's 1948 invincibles, Warwick Armstrong's 1920-21 Australians, Frank Worrell's 1963 West Indians and, at a pinch, the Illingworth Army, undefeated in 26 Tests through the late 60s and early 70s, could all challenge Waugh's side as the greatest ever. </p> <p>What is unnerving, however, is they have won 10 successive Tests despite having glaring room for improvement. Slater still lacks a reliable opening partner - Matthew Hayden gets yet another chance tomorrow - and the speed dream team of Lee, Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie have yet to grace the field together; the latter withdrew yesterday with a hamstring strain. Just how far can they go? </p> <p>Among the crowd tipping a whitewash of the Windies this summer are Kim Hughes (\"our third team would beat them, the top XI will murder them\") and Ashley Mallett (\"Australia will win 5-0 unless they all play dead\"). It is far from fantasy: the tourists have been blitzed in their opening two first-class matches and will field an attack green enough to make the survivors of the 1960-61 tied Test, who will be at the Gabba tomorrow, turn red. </p> <p>If Hughes, Mallett and co are right, Australia will have won 15 on the trot come January. Add a quick fling in India and they could arrive on England's doorstep next summer chasing an unthinkable 19. </p> <p>Steve Waugh was not kidding. Australia may be on the verge of something special.</p>",

And he was a phenomenally acrobatic fielder to boot. \"I don't want to upset Steve Waugh too much,\" the former Australia left-hander Neil Harvey opined this year, \"but I don't think his team is as good as Ian Chappell's 1972 side or Richie Benaud's 1958 side, let alone the 1948 side.\" Fans of Bradman's 1948 invincibles, Warwick Armstrong's 1920-21 Australians, Frank Worrell's 1963 West Indians and, at a pinch, the Illingworth Army, undefeated in 26 Tests through the late 60s and early 70s, could all challenge Waugh's side as the greatest ever. What is unnerving, however, is they have won 10 successive Tests despite having glaring room for improvement. Slater still lacks a reliable opening partner - Matthew Hayden gets yet another chance tomorrow - and the speed dream team of Lee, Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie have yet to grace the field together; the latter withdrew yesterday with a hamstring strain. Just how far can they go? Among the crowd tipping a whitewash of the Windies this summer are Kim Hughes (\"our third team would beat them, the top XI will murder them\") and Ashley Mallett (\"Australia will win 5-0 unless they all play dead\"). It is far from fantasy: the tourists have been blitzed in their opening two first-class matches and will field an attack green enough to make the survivors of the 1960-61 tied Test, who will be at the Gabba tomorrow, turn red. If Hughes, Mallett and co are right, Australia will have won 15 on the trot come January. Add a quick fling in India and they could arrive on England's doorstep next summer chasing an unthinkable 19. Steve Waugh was not kidding. Australia may be on the verge of something special.",

      "body": "<p>Laurent D'Jaffo last night prevented his fellow Frenchman and idol Jean Tigana from pulling Fulham eight points clear at the top of the First Division when he cancelled out Steve Finnan's fourth-minute goal with a bizarre strike four minutes later. </p> <p>Fulham ran rings round United's defence in the first few minutes, barely allowing them a sniff of the ball, and it was no surprise when Steve Finnan put them ahead with a remarkable solo effort. </p> <p>The defender, who scored on his Republic of Ireland debut last week, picked up the ball 40 yards from goal and embarked on a dazzling run that swept him past four bemused defenders. Finding himself in the penalty area, he calmly drew Simon Tracey before prodding home with his left foot from 12 yards. </p> <p>Normally that might have seen Fulham slip into overdrive. Yet four minutes later a lapse in concentration allowed United to equalise. Michael Brown played the ball into the path of the French striker Laurent D'Jaffo and he reacted well to smack a shot against the angle of post and bar. </p> <p>As he lay on the ground Fulham made a hash of mopping up the danger and, when the ball found its way back towards D'Jaffo, he leapt up and tapped it in. </p> <p>That gave United renewed heart and Marcus Bent should have made more of Paul Devlin's right-wing cross. But, with the goal at his mercy, he headed straight into the arms of the waiting Mikhail Taylor. </p> <p>Fulham, though, refused to be knocked out of their stride and on 24 minutes only the agility of Tracey denied Fabrice Fernandes.

      "bodyText": "Laurent D'Jaffo last night prevented his fellow Frenchman and idol Jean Tigana from pulling Fulham eight points clear at the top of the First Division when he cancelled out Steve Finnan's fourth-minute goal with a bizarre strike four minutes later. Fulham ran rings round United's defence in the first few minutes, barely allowing them a sniff of the ball, and it was no surprise when Steve Finnan put them ahead with a remarkable solo effort. The defender, who scored on his Republic of Ireland debut last week, picked up the ball 40 yards from goal and embarked on a dazzling run that swept him past four bemused defenders. Finding himself in the penalty area, he calmly drew Simon Tracey before prodding home with his left foot from 12 yards. Normally that might have seen Fulham slip into overdrive. Yet four minutes later a lapse in concentration allowed United to equalise. Michael Brown played the ball into the path of the French striker Laurent D'Jaffo and he reacted well to smack a shot against the angle of post and bar. As he lay on the ground Fulham made a hash of mopping up the danger and, when the ball found its way back towards D'Jaffo, he leapt up and tapped it in. That gave United renewed heart and Marcus Bent should have made more of Paul Devlin's right-wing cross. But, with the goal at his mercy, he headed straight into the arms of the waiting Mikhail Taylor. Fulham, though, refused to be knocked out of their stride and on 24 minutes only the agility of Tracey denied Fabrice Fernandes. Lee Clark then tried a 25-yard drive that whistled into the keeper's arms and Finnan blazed over. Jean Tigana brought on Luis Boa Morte for the ineffective Louis Saha on the hour and 10 minutes later United handed a first taste of League action to their Cameroon international Patrick Suffo. The striker had been forced to wait for his debut after a spitting incident in France when he was with Nantes. Having finally completed his eight-month ban, he was given a rousing reception by the home crowd. Sheffield United (4-4-2): Tracey; Uhlenbeek, Murphy, Curle, Quinn; Devlin, Santos, Brown, Woodhouse; D'Jaffo, Bent. Fulham (4-4-2): Taylor; Finnan, Melville, Coleman, Brevitt; Davis, Clark, Fernandes, Goldbaek; Hayles, Saha. Referee: P Rejer (Tipton). \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Apparently, we are all queuing up not to get on the bus, but to carry our favourite coffee mug upstairs and cosy up with the laptop. We are fed up with the distractions, irritations and office-politics of the commuting life. And the overwhelming reason given by the 10,000 employees and employers questioned for the government by University of Warwick researchers was that they could be much, much more efficient if they worked at home. </p> <p>I can see that there would be spin-off benefits for society generally from home-working: fewer commuting journeys, less stress, more flexible hours and so forth. And some handy savings for employers, too: reduced office space costs, lower heating and light bills, lower rates of absenteeism. But for anyone to argue that working from home is more efficient... Well, nice try, folks: you can fool the government and the researchers from Warwick, but you can't fool me. </p> <p>The truth is that working from home is hell. It is not just inefficient; it's impossible. If you're very lucky, you might have a dedicated study in which you can barricade yourself against the depredations of household pets, the screaming tantrums of pre-schoolers, the marauding curiosity of post-schoolers and the general mayhem that is family life. For at least two people I know who work from home, the only way in which they could establish a sufficiently airtight and soundproof cordon sanitaire to keep their domestic menageries out of their working environment was to move into a shed in the garden. </p> <p>I'm sorry, but where I come from, garden sheds are for middle-aged men to keep their potting compost and jazz mags in. They were never intended as hi-tech business units for teleworkers to blaze the trail of the new economy. </p> <p>When I started working from home, I didn't have a study, so I set up a desk in the living room. This meant our young children were then exiled to the ground floor with their nanny. The only satisfactory aspect of this arrangement was that she was prevented from pacifying them with non-stop screenings of Pingu and the Teletubbies. Within weeks, however, my wife went freelance, too - working out of our bedroom on a folding table. As if having young children were not stressful enough, our marriage was put to the test by ferocious turf wars for telephone time, involving much hissing and angry gesticulation. Of course, we ordered a new phone number at once, but since we had recently swapped service providers, it proved impossible to get a line installed. An engineer finally kept a fourth appointment. Come to think of it, at least I hadn't given up any working time keeping the others - an efficiency saving after all! </p> <p>The other awkward truth about home-working is that if, like me, you suffer from the slightest defect of motivation, you are placing yourself in the grip of mental agony. First, there are all those household chores you should really do before you start work - otherwise, you know that the dirty plates, the unhung laundry, the uncleaned loo will be whispering their silent reproaches all day. Then there's that fascinating radio programme you never used to catch when you went out to work: it only lasts half an hour, after all. And daytime TV? Let's not even go there. </p> <p>Competition for phone and desk use meant I found myself migrating around the house with my laptop - even, on one occasion, perching on the loo because it provided temporary sanctuary from the domestic chaos raging outside. Contrary to popular assumptions, laptops are not actually intended for use on your lap; a few minutes of that results in aching shoulders and tingling fingers. It soon became obvious total nervous breakdown would shortly follow. </p> <p>I remember researching and writing one article for a Sunday newspaper about the phenomenon of \"presenteeism\": the practice of spending long hours in the office, even unproductive hours, in order to appear \"committed\". To be sure, Britain does have a severe problem with its workplace culture of long hours - as the government's survey also highlights - but all I could think of at the time was, chance would be a fine thing! </p> <p>Eventually, I found a cheap office-share with some other self-employees. My life - and my productivity - improved a hundred-fold. I could cycle to work, stop at a Starbucks, arrive with a latte at a quiet, empty office and do an uninterrupted day's work. I got so much more done I could even find time to go swimming or stop at the shops on my way home. After the madness of home-working, it was bliss. </p> <p>What I discovered, even though I was then still working a four-day week and looking after my children for the extra day, was that a distinct break - a mental firewall, as much as the physical distance - between work and home was, for me at least, crucial for psychological health. When I was at work, I could really focus on the task I had set myself: I could achieve it, or something near enough, and then leave for the day, my mind at rest. By the same token, once I was at home, I was really present: instead of worrying about my work and scheming to snatch a few extra minutes at the computer or sneak in one more phone call, I could devote myself and my attention fully to my children and the domestic routine. </p> <p>I realised also that, correspondingly, there is something profoundly depressing about working at home. It's as if you haven't got a proper job, as if you are some sad Walter Mitty-type fantastist, pathetically impersonating someone with a professional career, or like the eponymous hero of John Lanchester's last novel, Mr Phillips, who cannot accept his own obsolescence after being made redundant. Most of us gain self-esteem from our identity as a working person, but there is little benefit if that work takes place in social isolation. </p> <p>It may be a \"guy thing\", this need for compartmentalisation: home here, work there. But I suspect not. The interesting small print of this week's survey was that men are far more enthusiastic than women about home-working: 40% of men, as against 29% of women, expressed a desire to work away from the office. Perhaps the women know something the men don't. All I know is that after a hectic family weekend, a week in the office feels like R and R.</p>",

Nationwide and the other traditional lenders are having to fight hard to hold on to their borrowers, many of whom are being lured to more attractive deals by new entrants, some of them internet-based. This month saw the arrival in the UK of Australia's biggest financial services company, Commonwealth Bank of Aus tralia, which is offering a range of flexible mortgages through an internet and telephone venture called NewWorld. In the summer HSBC cut its standard variable mortgage rate by almost one percentage point, and the Halifax's new phone bank, Intelligent Finance, launched with a competitive rate. Nationwide said someone with a \u00a360,000 interest-only mortgage would see monthly bills cut by \u00a310 a month (from \u00a3364.50 to \u00a3354.50). For a borrower with a \u00a3100,000 loan the saving would be \u00a316.66 a month. The Bank of England has kept interest rates on hold since February and there is a growing expectation among commentators that the next interest rate movement is more likely to be down than up, said Nationwide. Rivals said the Nationwide move showed the mortgage price war was taking its toll.",

      "body": "<p> Spending a lot of time alone isn't always healthy. Left to stew in their own idiosyncratic juices, most singer-songwriters end up self-pitying and self-indulgent. Ed Harcourt, however, is different. </p> <p>For a start, the 23-year-old plays electric piano, not acoustic guitar. And, while he retreated to a dilapidated house in a forest to write many of his dark songs, his biography reveals that he was nearly expelled from school for building a five-foot penis out of snow. It's safe to say he's serious but not taking himself too seriously. Last night he was joined by four supremely adept musicians playing everything from double-bass to trumpet. If his debut mini-album, Maplewood, is a homely peek into his world, here his songs were transformed into truly magical creations. </p> <p>On certain levels, it's simple.

      "bodyText": "Spending a lot of time alone isn't always healthy. Left to stew in their own idiosyncratic juices, most singer-songwriters end up self-pitying and self-indulgent. Ed Harcourt, however, is different. For a start, the 23-year-old plays electric piano, not acoustic guitar. And, while he retreated to a dilapidated house in a forest to write many of his dark songs, his biography reveals that he was nearly expelled from school for building a five-foot penis out of snow. It's safe to say he's serious but not taking himself too seriously. Last night he was joined by four supremely adept musicians playing everything from double-bass to trumpet. If his debut mini-album, Maplewood, is a homely peek into his world, here his songs were transformed into truly magical creations. On certain levels, it's simple. Driving electric piano, pure plug-in joy, is juxtaposed with double-bass and that mercurial trumpet, while Harcourt unravels masterful melodies. The gospel-inflected Apple of My Eye could be U2, if they hadn't stopped writing good songs. Hangin' with the Wrong Crowd and Shanghai, meanwhile, are rich slabs of West Coast rock.

For these are cheeky, impudent paintings. Faces swell out of the fabric panels; ghoulish eyes and noses peek from a seemingly innocent pale canvas. The way the fabric falls, you see a hooded figure or peer into suddenly obscene orifices, never quite sure if you have imagined it all. </p> <p>First impressions are of intensity and elegance, especially in the first room, containing only white and cream paintings. Austere to begin with, these works grow on you. Their physicality reveals itself slowly, quietly. Spectral or sexual in the main, they are about the stories pieces of fabric might hold, the secrets they may have witnessed. Their use in concealment or undressing, the fact that to cover up can be more powerfully erotic than revealing all: this is what fascinates Watt. Swathes of cloth hang heavy, a droop or crumple of fabric begs questions, and sometimes there is an almost stifling human presence, especially in Rivi\u00e8re, a big deep intimate fold of fabric. </p> <p>Less successful are the works that incorporate colour, not least because they are more like portraits of cloth rather than the fantastical, playful images in lighter tones. Suspend is the strongest of these, all flimsy loveliness, a gorgeous study in Virgin Mary blue, whereas Tournon, a painting of some vintage green and yellow fabric, feels like the life has been drained out of it. And it is life that Watt's best work captures - the way a discarded robe might tell a story, or crumpled sheets mean anything but sleep has taken place.

      "body": "<p>Behind the fanfare surrounding the government's first major report on work-life balance lies another truth about the contradictions we all face juggling home and the workplace. One of the reasons balancing work and \"life\" is so difficult is that work, for many of us, is so appealing. </p> <p>Work is a gateway to a social network, to friends, to a community. In a world of increased individualism and globalisation, many of us are seeking a sense of belonging somewhere or to someone. In politics, this desire for belonging can translate into nationalism and racism, on one hand, or environmentalism on the other. On a personal level, the search for belonging takes people to internet chat rooms and clubs, to coffee shops - and to work. </p> <p>Work seems to offer a ready-made community. It is a source of friends and lovers. Psychologically speaking, it enables individuals to relate to other individuals, and to society. One in three respondents to an Industrial Society survey met most of their friends through their current or previous jobs. The survey exploded the myth that work is a domain for male-only bonding: 49% of female respondents met most of their friends at work, compared with only 19% of the men.

      "bodyText": "Behind the fanfare surrounding the government's first major report on work-life balance lies another truth about the contradictions we all face juggling home and the workplace. One of the reasons balancing work and \"life\" is so difficult is that work, for many of us, is so appealing. Work is a gateway to a social network, to friends, to a community. In a world of increased individualism and globalisation, many of us are seeking a sense of belonging somewhere or to someone. In politics, this desire for belonging can translate into nationalism and racism, on one hand, or environmentalism on the other. On a personal level, the search for belonging takes people to internet chat rooms and clubs, to coffee shops - and to work. Work seems to offer a ready-made community. It is a source of friends and lovers. Psychologically speaking, it enables individuals to relate to other individuals, and to society. One in three respondents to an Industrial Society survey met most of their friends through their current or previous jobs. The survey exploded the myth that work is a domain for male-only bonding: 49% of female respondents met most of their friends at work, compared with only 19% of the men. Judi James, in her book Sex at Work, estimates that up to half of us meet our future partners through the workplace. No wonder it can seem so appealing.
