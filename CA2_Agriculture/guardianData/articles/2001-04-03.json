The servant Regina, informed that she is Oswald's half-sister, promptly cuts and runs.

Paul Farnsworth's set, with its large angled mirror, is elegantly hermetic but gives little sense of the way climate affects character. Big moments, such as Mrs Alving's realisation that \"there are as many ghosts as grains of sand\", are lent a gratuitous portentousness by the use of an echo-chamber effect.

Francesca Annis's Mrs Alving could do more to suggest a woman intellectually inflamed by new radical ideas. Where she does score is in her recollected revulsion at nursing her diseased husband so that when she tells Manders \"I did everything\" the lines acquire an extraordinary sexual charge. Anthony Andrews's excellent Manders also combines a poker-backed rigidity with hints of a fiercely repressed sensuality.

To Manders he is full of sanctimonious piety. But left alone with his supposed daughter, Regina, he becomes a reptilian pimp; when he talks of \"a father's guiding hand\" he places it unequivocally on her breast. Sarah Tansey's Regina reacts with proper disgust but also conveys the character's inherited hedonism while Martin Hutson's Oswald movingly portrays the character's progressive deterioration. Maybe there is something melodramatic about Oswald's final collapse. But the play still shows Ibsen to be an intellectual visionary.

Shares in London Clubs dropped to a new low, down 3p to 33.5p, on the announcement. There was speculation that the group, which owns four London clubs - Les Ambassadeurs, St James's, the Sportsman and the Golden Nugget - would require a rights issue to help meet its debt repayments. Other options include a takeover by venture capi talists or leisure magnate Trevor Hemmings, who already holds a 10% stake, or the sale of some of its operations to rivals Stanley Leisure. A spokesman said: \"They haven't decided yet what they are going to do.\" The British group has a 40% stake in the struggling $1.3bn (\u00a3915m) Aladdin, on Las Vegas's famous Strip, which reported pretax losses of $8.56m for 2000. This is the latest bad news from holding company Aladdin Gaming Enterprises, which has been forced to cut staff numbers from 4,500 to 3,100 since opening in August last year. The US company said that poor performance, particularly in its hotel and slot machine divisions over recent months, meant that bank loans might have to be revised again. They were reviewed last week to meet financial obligations. Last week, the Los Angeles Times reported that financial pressures have created bad blood between Aladdin's stakeholders, and that competitors appeared poised to take over. \"This is not a matter of if it goes bad, it's a matter of when,\" one US banker told the newspaper. Analysts said the casino's weak performance was largely the result of poor marketing, but added that the venue has also been hit by the wider slowdown in the US economy.

Goals from Mullery and Peters have put Alf Ramsey's team 2-0 up and, as far as Wilson is concerned, success in Mexico will translate into votes for Labour four days later. </p> <p>Sadly, it does not work out that way. The West Germans fight back to win 3-2 in extra time and Ted Heath snatches victory from the jaws of defeat. In the search for scapegoats, Labour says the tummy bug that laid low goalkeeper Gordon Banks and the arrival of the two new jumbo jets that magnified the trade deficit helped to change the mood of the electorate. </p> <p>June 2001. On the eve of the date set for the general election, England are due to play a World Cup qualifying match against Greece. Greece are not West Germany, but then England in 2001 are not the England of 1970. Moreover, the economic outlook, which had looked so promising in the early spring, has suddenly turned gloomy as a result of the twin effects of the global stock market meltdown and the foot and mouth epidemic. The dreaded R word - recession - is back in use for the first time in almost 10 years and, to the dismay of ministers, feelgood turns into feelbad. Against all the odds, William Hague ends up as the new occupant of 10 Downing Street. </p> <p><strong> Not immune</strong><br> </p> <p> Unlikely? Implausible? Impossible? Given the extent of Tony Blair's lead in the opinion polls, it would seem so, but the prospect of the economy taking a sudden turn for the worse is something that haunts Labour's strategists. The latest survey of manufacturing from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply this week showed that Britain is not immune from the economic malaise seeping out of the United States. Output from factories is down, order books are weak, jobs are being cut. </p> <p>Fortunately for the government, manufacturing is only one part of the economy. While the problems faced by the industrial sector are real and worrying, for the time being they can be disguised by low inflation, low unemployment, rising real incomes, a robust housing market and the seemingly insatiable appetite of the British consumer to spend, spend, spend. The government's preferred measure of inflation, the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments, shows that the cost of living is rising by 1.9%, while unemployment is at its lowest level since the mid-1970s. </p> <p>With average earnings rising at 4.4% a year and taxes coming down, real incomes are rising strongly, leading to the fastest increase in consumer spending since the Lawson boom of the late 1980s. Job security plus additional spending power are the two main ingredients of a feelgood factor, and it is this that the government was seeking to exploit to the full with a May poll. </p> <p>So what could spoil the party? The most obvious threat to the government's carefully laid election plans is the continued turbulence in the global economy. Share prices were falling again yesterday, reflecting concern over the health of the US economy, fears that Japan is poised to go back into recession and signs that Germany is slowing down rapidly. The effects of all this have already been felt by exporters, but the danger for the government is that the bear market in global equities will feed through into a wholesale collapse in consumer confidence. </p> <p>Despite signs that individuals are becoming more pessimistic about the outlook for the economy as a whole, they are still relatively upbeat about their own prospects. Ministers fear that this may not be the case in October, let alone in the spring of next year. </p> <p>For the time being, any weakness in the domestic economy can be offset by cuts in interest rates. The Bank of England has the scope to ease monetary policy either tomorrow or at its next meeting in early May, and the weakness of the global economy should mean that imported goods fall in price over the coming months, keeping inflation well below its 2.5% target. This will enable the Bank to keep on cutting and consumers to keep on consuming. </p> <p>However, this will merely amplify a deeper problem in the British economy - the tendency for spending to outstrip the increase in productive capacity. Richard Jeffrey, director of economics at Charter house Securities, said that over the past five years household spending has increased by 4% a year on average, and of the 2.8% average growth in GDP over that period 2.5% has come from household consumption. \"While it is to be expected that in most years consumers will be the mainstay of the economy, their role in the recent period has been too prominent. The result has been growth in domestic demand that has far outstripped the economy's ability to supply.\" </p> <p>Gordon Brown has acknowledged that this is a long-term problem for Britain, and has come up with ideas to boost investment and productivity. However, these will take years to bear fruit and in the meantime the Treasury's figures show that domestic final demand is expected to grow by 4% in 2001 while the economy as a whole is predicted to grow by 2.5%. </p> <p>Higher government spending and stronger investment are part of the reason for the buoyancy of domestic demand, but the real driving force will be consumer spending. </p> <p><strong> Age-old problem</strong><br> </p> <p> For decades, that tendency to spend more than the nation produces has been flagged by the imbalance between demand and supply showing up in the current account. The portents here are not good. Between 1992 and 1997, Britain's trade deficit in goods remained steady at between \u00a311bn and \u00a313bn a year, and the shortfall was almost entirely offset by Britain's surplus in trade in services. The deficit in goods rose to \u00a320.5bn in 1998, \u00a326.2bn in 1999 and \u00a328.7bn in 1999. </p> <p>The ballooning of the trade deficit is not just the result of the US-induced downturn in the global economy; the current account is now feeling the full impact of the over-valuation of sterling, which makes exports dearer and imports cheaper. </p> <p>However, a strong pound, the absence of foreign tourists, falling US demand and slower global growth suggest that at some point in the not-too-distant future the age-old problem of the balance of payments will again rear its head. </p> <p>As Geoffrey Dicks, chief economist with the Royal Bank of Scotland, puts it: \"It cannot be reassuring that we seem to have to expand spending 1.5 times to get 1.0 back on output since a large part of the spending goes straight into imports and the current account deficit. One bad set of trade figures is said to have cost Harold Wilson the 1970 election; Messrs Blair and Brown must be hoping the same does not happen again.\"</p>",

The Bank of England has the scope to ease monetary policy either tomorrow or at its next meeting in early May, and the weakness of the global economy should mean that imported goods fall in price over the coming months, keeping inflation well below its 2.5% target. This will enable the Bank to keep on cutting and consumers to keep on consuming. However, this will merely amplify a deeper problem in the British economy - the tendency for spending to outstrip the increase in productive capacity. Richard Jeffrey, director of economics at Charter house Securities, said that over the past five years household spending has increased by 4% a year on average, and of the 2.8% average growth in GDP over that period 2.5% has come from household consumption. \"While it is to be expected that in most years consumers will be the mainstay of the economy, their role in the recent period has been too prominent. The result has been growth in domestic demand that has far outstripped the economy's ability to supply.\" Gordon Brown has acknowledged that this is a long-term problem for Britain, and has come up with ideas to boost investment and productivity. However, these will take years to bear fruit and in the meantime the Treasury's figures show that domestic final demand is expected to grow by 4% in 2001 while the economy as a whole is predicted to grow by 2.5%. Higher government spending and stronger investment are part of the reason for the buoyancy of domestic demand, but the real driving force will be consumer spending. Age-old problem For decades, that tendency to spend more than the nation produces has been flagged by the imbalance between demand and supply showing up in the current account. The portents here are not good. Between 1992 and 1997, Britain's trade deficit in goods remained steady at between \u00a311bn and \u00a313bn a year, and the shortfall was almost entirely offset by Britain's surplus in trade in services. The deficit in goods rose to \u00a320.5bn in 1998, \u00a326.2bn in 1999 and \u00a328.7bn in 1999. The ballooning of the trade deficit is not just the result of the US-induced downturn in the global economy; the current account is now feeling the full impact of the over-valuation of sterling, which makes exports dearer and imports cheaper. However, a strong pound, the absence of foreign tourists, falling US demand and slower global growth suggest that at some point in the not-too-distant future the age-old problem of the balance of payments will again rear its head. As Geoffrey Dicks, chief economist with the Royal Bank of Scotland, puts it: \"It cannot be reassuring that we seem to have to expand spending 1.5 times to get 1.0 back on output since a large part of the spending goes straight into imports and the current account deficit. One bad set of trade figures is said to have cost Harold Wilson the 1970 election; Messrs Blair and Brown must be hoping the same does not happen again.\"",

A few yards further on they pause opposite the main entrance to the Estadio Riazor to watch the late arrivals joining a crowd of 30,000 for the match between Deportivo and Villarreal. </p> <p>The kick-off is a quarter of an hour away and the mood is festive. There are no mobs of aggressive young men, no beer cans rattling around the gutters, no raucous chanting. A few minutes later the priest himself arrives, the morning's sports paper tucked under his arm, greeting friends and parishioners before entering to take his usual seat. </p> <p>Nobility and warmth, you could say, are what we think of when we think of Spanish football - the nobility of Real Madrid, eight times champions of Europe, and the warmth of Barcelona's 100,000-strong aficion , fired by regional pride. A third defining characteristic might be the vast wealth, or at least the semblance of it, which allows hugely indebted clubs to set new world records for transfer fees practically every season. </p> <p>Such conspicuous consumption is not on display in La Coruna. But the other qualities can be found, albeit in a lower register, in this medium-sized fishing town in Galicia, in the top left-hand corner of Spain, where Deportivo, founded in 1906, are the reigning champions of La Liga and ready to challenge Leeds United for a place in the semi-finals of the European Cup. </p> <p>Deportivo's 4-2 victory over Villarreal at the weekend consolidated their second place in the domestic table and extended an unbeaten home league record stretching back 14 months. It was also an example of almost everything that is best about Spanish football, which has entered the new century as Europe's ruling power. Deportivo played on Saturday as if the only point of the game were to score more goals than the opposition, and to accomplish the task with grace and dash and wit. </p> <p><strong> Test of the best</strong><br> </p> <p> Emerson Leao, Brazil's national coach, must have felt at home as he watched from the VIP box, and not just because of the presence of several of his fellow countrymen on the pitch. Still smarting from last week's historic 1-0 defeat at the hands of Ecuador, Leao was there to check the form of Deportivo's Djalminha and Emerson Costa but came away praising the match for its overall entertainment value. </p> <p>Four Spanish teams are among the 12 taking part in this week's rounds of the major European club championships, and three of them are drawn against English sides. Apart from Leeds and Deportivo, Arsenal meet Valencia tomorrow and Liverpool travel to Barcelona to contest a place in the Uefa Cup final on Thursday. The fourth Spanish club, Real Madrid, continue the defence of their title against Galatasaray tonight and, if they make the semi-final, they will meet the winners of the tie between Manchester United and Bayern Munich. </p> <p>The Spanish clubs currently occupy the four top positions in their domestic league, as do their English counterparts, which means that the next couple of weeks offers a direct confrontation between two leagues who both consider themselves the world's best. The Spanish, in particular, are hoping to repeat their feat of last season, when the supporters of Real Madrid and Valencia borrowed the Stade de France to turn the European Cup final into a glorious party. </p> <p>At Elland Road tomorrow night Leeds's David O'Leary will find a formidable opponent in Javier Irureta, the quiet Basque who has coached Deportivo for the past three years. With the backing of Augusto Cesar Lendoiro, a local businessman who took over the presidency in 1988, when the club were in danger of relegation to the third division and had only 5,000 members, the coach has assembled an impressive squad. </p> <p>Its depth is such that it can ride the absence through injury of players such as Mauro Silva and Cesar Sampaio, the midfield anchors of Brazil's 1994 and 1998 World Cup teams, and Walter Pandiani, the Uruguayan forward whose hat-trick brought Deportivo back from a three-goal deficit at home to Paris St-Germain last month and gave them an astonishing 4-3 victory. On Saturday the substitutes included Roy Makaay, the Dutch international forward, who came on in the final minutes to score the fourth goal with an expert flourish. </p> <p>Before that, however, the supporters had been treated to a display of the flickering genius of the 30-year-old Djalminha, whose instant control brought him the opening goal, and the developing talent of Diego Tristan, a 24-year-old centre- forward who showed his power on the ball and his instinct for an opening with two fine goals. An athlete with the rangy build of a Steven Gerrard or a Sebastian Deisler, the Seville-born Tristan promises to become as significant a figure for Spain as he already is for La Coruna. </p> <p>Their habit of giving the ball away in midfield, often via over-ambitious flicks from the Brazilian duo, and frequent lapses of concentration in the central defence will have interested the two spies O'Leary sent to the Riazor on Saturday. But, as long as the goals keep going in, the club's 27,000 voting members will be happy. </p> <p>\"The fans like the football here because every game is an open competition,\" Makaay said on Saturday night. \"That makes it very different from Italy. </p> <p>\"People in Spain are very proud of what their football has achieved. Spanish clubs have reached five European finals in the past few years. And it's not just the big clubs. Alaves did well in Europe last year and there was the surprise of Valencia reaching the Champions League final. But English football is good, too. We know that Leeds have a good young team and I think we'll be starting 50-50 with them.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the excellent health of Spanish football is also due to the closer involvement of the supporters, who enjoy real rights in return for their ardour. Barcelona's 104,000 members, for example, can vote their presidents into and out of office. After losing Luis Figo to Real Madrid last summer, their team has not had a great season in the league and the Nou Camp was barely half full on Sunday, which means that a mere 55,000 were present when Barca met 12th-placed Las Palmas, captained by Vinny Samways, the former Tottenham midfield man, but a 4-1 win left the crowd in a mood that matched the balmy evening. </p> <p>Leao was present once again, this time to keep an eye on Rivaldo, whose play had been notable only for its incoherence when, in the 72nd minute, he ran through the visitors' defence to meet Frank de Boer's 60-yard diagonal pass. One velvety touch to control the dropping ball, an instant left-foot shot and Barca had their third goal, capped two minutes later by an effort from Dani which ended Las Palmas' resistance. </p> <p>They could have had half a dozen more - but they could have given away a few more, too, and it is hard to imagine Liverpool allowing Marc Overmars the kind of space and time in which he was able to exploit a string of passes from the impressive 20-year-old Xavi. </p> <p>For all the excellence of the five Dutchmen who wore Barca's shirt on Sunday, this season might be the last for the orange-dominated team assembled by their former coach, Louis van Gaal. The emergence of Xavi, Tristan and Las Palmas' outstanding pair of local boys, the 19-year-old midfielder Jorge and the 21-year-old forward Antonio Guayre, prove that Spain is nurturing a new generation of gifted young players, but the probable arrival of the Argentine coach Hector Cuper from Valencia in the summer has prompted Barcelona to prepare an investment at least equal to the \u00a340m received from Real Madrid for Figo in order to attract a pair of Buenos Aires prodigies, Juan Riquelme from Boca Juniors and Javier Saviola from River Plate. </p> <p>The brandishing of vast sums of money, which maintains the aura of power and enables the top clubs to offer their fans the promise of glory, represents one face of Spanish football. But there is another side and it could be seen in La Coruna on Saturday night, an hour after the final whistle, when Irureta was leaving the ground, on his way to celebrate his 53rd birthday with a group of friends. </p> <p>His progress towards his car, which was parked across the street, was delayed for many minutes while he paused willingly to sign autographs and accept kisses from young girls and admire the ball-juggling tricks of small dark-eyed boys with dreams of their own. Here, a stone's throw from Chacho's statue, nobility and warmth could still be found. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Test of the best Emerson Leao, Brazil's national coach, must have felt at home as he watched from the VIP box, and not just because of the presence of several of his fellow countrymen on the pitch. Still smarting from last week's historic 1-0 defeat at the hands of Ecuador, Leao was there to check the form of Deportivo's Djalminha and Emerson Costa but came away praising the match for its overall entertainment value. Four Spanish teams are among the 12 taking part in this week's rounds of the major European club championships, and three of them are drawn against English sides. Apart from Leeds and Deportivo, Arsenal meet Valencia tomorrow and Liverpool travel to Barcelona to contest a place in the Uefa Cup final on Thursday. The fourth Spanish club, Real Madrid, continue the defence of their title against Galatasaray tonight and, if they make the semi-final, they will meet the winners of the tie between Manchester United and Bayern Munich. The Spanish clubs currently occupy the four top positions in their domestic league, as do their English counterparts, which means that the next couple of weeks offers a direct confrontation between two leagues who both consider themselves the world's best. The Spanish, in particular, are hoping to repeat their feat of last season, when the supporters of Real Madrid and Valencia borrowed the Stade de France to turn the European Cup final into a glorious party. At Elland Road tomorrow night Leeds's David O'Leary will find a formidable opponent in Javier Irureta, the quiet Basque who has coached Deportivo for the past three years. With the backing of Augusto Cesar Lendoiro, a local businessman who took over the presidency in 1988, when the club were in danger of relegation to the third division and had only 5,000 members, the coach has assembled an impressive squad. Its depth is such that it can ride the absence through injury of players such as Mauro Silva and Cesar Sampaio, the midfield anchors of Brazil's 1994 and 1998 World Cup teams, and Walter Pandiani, the Uruguayan forward whose hat-trick brought Deportivo back from a three-goal deficit at home to Paris St-Germain last month and gave them an astonishing 4-3 victory. On Saturday the substitutes included Roy Makaay, the Dutch international forward, who came on in the final minutes to score the fourth goal with an expert flourish. Before that, however, the supporters had been treated to a display of the flickering genius of the 30-year-old Djalminha, whose instant control brought him the opening goal, and the developing talent of Diego Tristan, a 24-year-old centre- forward who showed his power on the ball and his instinct for an opening with two fine goals. An athlete with the rangy build of a Steven Gerrard or a Sebastian Deisler, the Seville-born Tristan promises to become as significant a figure for Spain as he already is for La Coruna. Their habit of giving the ball away in midfield, often via over-ambitious flicks from the Brazilian duo, and frequent lapses of concentration in the central defence will have interested the two spies O'Leary sent to the Riazor on Saturday. But, as long as the goals keep going in, the club's 27,000 voting members will be happy. \"The fans like the football here because every game is an open competition,\" Makaay said on Saturday night. \"That makes it very different from Italy. \"People in Spain are very proud of what their football has achieved. Spanish clubs have reached five European finals in the past few years. And it's not just the big clubs. Alaves did well in Europe last year and there was the surprise of Valencia reaching the Champions League final. But English football is good, too. We know that Leeds have a good young team and I think we'll be starting 50-50 with them.\" Perhaps the excellent health of Spanish football is also due to the closer involvement of the supporters, who enjoy real rights in return for their ardour. Barcelona's 104,000 members, for example, can vote their presidents into and out of office. After losing Luis Figo to Real Madrid last summer, their team has not had a great season in the league and the Nou Camp was barely half full on Sunday, which means that a mere 55,000 were present when Barca met 12th-placed Las Palmas, captained by Vinny Samways, the former Tottenham midfield man, but a 4-1 win left the crowd in a mood that matched the balmy evening. Leao was present once again, this time to keep an eye on Rivaldo, whose play had been notable only for its incoherence when, in the 72nd minute, he ran through the visitors' defence to meet Frank de Boer's 60-yard diagonal pass. One velvety touch to control the dropping ball, an instant left-foot shot and Barca had their third goal, capped two minutes later by an effort from Dani which ended Las Palmas' resistance. They could have had half a dozen more - but they could have given away a few more, too, and it is hard to imagine Liverpool allowing Marc Overmars the kind of space and time in which he was able to exploit a string of passes from the impressive 20-year-old Xavi. For all the excellence of the five Dutchmen who wore Barca's shirt on Sunday, this season might be the last for the orange-dominated team assembled by their former coach, Louis van Gaal. The emergence of Xavi, Tristan and Las Palmas' outstanding pair of local boys, the 19-year-old midfielder Jorge and the 21-year-old forward Antonio Guayre, prove that Spain is nurturing a new generation of gifted young players, but the probable arrival of the Argentine coach Hector Cuper from Valencia in the summer has prompted Barcelona to prepare an investment at least equal to the \u00a340m received from Real Madrid for Figo in order to attract a pair of Buenos Aires prodigies, Juan Riquelme from Boca Juniors and Javier Saviola from River Plate. The brandishing of vast sums of money, which maintains the aura of power and enables the top clubs to offer their fans the promise of glory, represents one face of Spanish football. But there is another side and it could be seen in La Coruna on Saturday night, an hour after the final whistle, when Irureta was leaving the ground, on his way to celebrate his 53rd birthday with a group of friends. His progress towards his car, which was parked across the street, was delayed for many minutes while he paused willingly to sign autographs and accept kisses from young girls and admire the ball-juggling tricks of small dark-eyed boys with dreams of their own. Here, a stone's throw from Chacho's statue, nobility and warmth could still be found. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

I cried again when my daughter called me from Accra after the match. I have not watched the tape to see what might have gone wrong.\" </p> <p>If, in Bayern's eyes, wrongs are righted against United over the next fortnight, then expect the African defender's joy to be as spontaneous and as vividly expressed as his grief in Barcelona. But, whatever this devout Christian does, \"God will direct,\" he says. \"His grace is always with me. I want everyone to know He is with me at all times.\" </p> <p>Judging by Bayern's performance in Saturday's 3-2 home defeat by Werder Bremen, when Kuffour was blamed by some for all three goals, the Ghanaian will not be alone in needing assistance from above at Old Trafford tonight. </p> <p>But, as an important member of one of the continent's most powerful teams, he can also boast Bundesliga and German Cup medals - not bad for a one-time shoeshine boy from Kumasi who left school at 13 and Africa at 15. </p> <p>For many neutrals the 24-year-old was the man of the match in the Nou Camp, subduing Dwight Yorke with his powerful, aggressive defending.

Lately it has been Barcelona. </p> <p>Kuffour, contracted to Bayern until 2003, was told he was going nowhere and fined \u00a33,000 last month for talks over a meal in Munich with Bernd Schuster, who was acting for Barcelona. The player initially retorted: \"I'm no slave. I can go out for dinner after training with whoever I like.\" Later, he admitted: \"I was a little bit foolish.\" </p> <p>The Ghanaian attributes much of his success to Giovanni Trapattoni, the Italian former Bayern coach: \"He is the best in the world. He made me the player I am today.\" Trapattoni reciprocates: \"In terms of athleticism and commitment he is first rate. He sticks so close to his striker that you expect him to follow the man to the changing room at half-time.\" </p> <p>German critics were not so kind to Kuffour after Saturday's error-strewn display. But no one knows which Kuffour will be seen at Old Trafford: the disciplined marker, or the headstrong defender who was sent off for Bayern five times last season. For tonight, and for his entire future, \"God will direct.\" </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Kuffour's tears and beating fists as he crouched with his head in the Nou Camp turf - he had to be borne up like a funeral mourner as he awaited his loser's medal - are the abiding images in the moment of cruel defeat in the 1999 final. \"It was as if the whole world had fallen on me,\" he recalls. \"I couldn't control my tears. I cried again when my daughter called me from Accra after the match. I have not watched the tape to see what might have gone wrong.\" If, in Bayern's eyes, wrongs are righted against United over the next fortnight, then expect the African defender's joy to be as spontaneous and as vividly expressed as his grief in Barcelona. But, whatever this devout Christian does, \"God will direct,\" he says. \"His grace is always with me. I want everyone to know He is with me at all times.\" Judging by Bayern's performance in Saturday's 3-2 home defeat by Werder Bremen, when Kuffour was blamed by some for all three goals, the Ghanaian will not be alone in needing assistance from above at Old Trafford tonight. But, as an important member of one of the continent's most powerful teams, he can also boast Bundesliga and German Cup medals - not bad for a one-time shoeshine boy from Kumasi who left school at 13 and Africa at 15. For many neutrals the 24-year-old was the man of the match in the Nou Camp, subduing Dwight Yorke with his powerful, aggressive defending. His list of admirers has increased since. He claimed he had \"a lengthy talk with Manchester United officials\" after the 1999 final. Lately it has been Barcelona. Kuffour, contracted to Bayern until 2003, was told he was going nowhere and fined \u00a33,000 last month for talks over a meal in Munich with Bernd Schuster, who was acting for Barcelona. The player initially retorted: \"I'm no slave. I can go out for dinner after training with whoever I like.\" Later, he admitted: \"I was a little bit foolish.\" The Ghanaian attributes much of his success to Giovanni Trapattoni, the Italian former Bayern coach: \"He is the best in the world. He made me the player I am today.\" Trapattoni reciprocates: \"In terms of athleticism and commitment he is first rate. He sticks so close to his striker that you expect him to follow the man to the changing room at half-time.\" German critics were not so kind to Kuffour after Saturday's error-strewn display. But no one knows which Kuffour will be seen at Old Trafford: the disciplined marker, or the headstrong defender who was sent off for Bayern five times last season. For tonight, and for his entire future, \"God will direct.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>So bland and cautious is the corporate culture of the modern NHS, it is difficult not to see in that small cadre of ex-managers and clinicians who have swapped a job in the health service for the world of NHS policy a certain subversive glamour. </p> <p>Combining academia, lobbying, journalism, consultancy and politics, they write articles for the British Medical Journal, pop up with soundbites on Newsnight or in the Guardian, write pamphlets, lobby ministers and discuss \"the big picture\" at conference seminars. </p> <p>At a time when publicly criticising health policy can be career kamikaze for NHS managers or civil servants, those people in organisations such as the NHS Confederation and the King's Fund have a clear - and luxurious - licence to say the \"unsayable\". </p> <p>A few years ago, Jennifer Dixon, director of health care policy at the King's Fund, published an article which revealed that GP fundholders received disproportionately more funding than their non-fundholder colleagues. </p> <p>The article was highlighted by the media, and became the basis for an inquiry into fundholding by the Commons health select committee. The then health secretary Virginia Bottomley was livid. Says Dr Dixon: \"There are times when you score a direct hit.\" </p> <p>The former public health doctor contrasts this with her spell as an \"insider\" on secondment to the Department of Health as policy adviser to former NHS chief executive Alan Langlands between 1998 and 2000. </p> <p>\"In the department you are less pro-active. Most of your work is non-attributable to you, and although you help develop policy, political advisers tend to formulate the new ideas. At the King's Fund I can be much more my own person.\"</p> <p>Dr Dixon also had a spell in academia. \"The difference between here and the University is that here if you appear in the newspaper, that is seen as part of your job, which is refreshing. In the University it is seen as rather eccentric.\"</p> <p>Although she sometimes misses the contact with patients that frontline NHS clinical work brings, she has no regrets about moving to the King's Fund. \"I did not find medicine intellectually stretching; you can easily get stuck on a kind of tramline and feel you cannot do anything else.\" </p> <p>Nigel Edwards, director of policy at the NHS Confederation, says: \"I enjoyed my time as a health service manager, but as a manager you spend so much time on day-to-day stuff, and less on fundamental policy questions. I was more interested in the 'big picture' stuff.\" </p> <p>The confederation represents NHS trusts and health authorities, lobbies ministers on their behalf, briefs its members and the media on policy issues, and disseminates good practice. </p> <p>It counts among its most recent successes the work it did on the NHS plan in spring 2000. It sat on government working groups and ended up steering several confederation ideas - including human resources policy and ambulatory care hospitals - into the final document. </p> <p>Mr Edwards points out that although on occasion it has been critical of government policy - such as over the private finance initiative - it does not have the total freedom of independently-funded organisations like the King's Fund. </p> <p>Getting to the heart of policy formulation requires a difficult political balancing act - speaking honestly about members' concerns and yet securing and maintaining the trust of ministers. </p> <p>\"Do you go onto the Today programme and say the NHS is failing and in meltdown - and then find that your appointment with the minister is cancelled? That is death for an organisation like ours. If that means sometimes biting your lips then we have to do it.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "So bland and cautious is the corporate culture of the modern NHS, it is difficult not to see in that small cadre of ex-managers and clinicians who have swapped a job in the health service for the world of NHS policy a certain subversive glamour. Combining academia, lobbying, journalism, consultancy and politics, they write articles for the British Medical Journal, pop up with soundbites on Newsnight or in the Guardian, write pamphlets, lobby ministers and discuss \"the big picture\" at conference seminars. At a time when publicly criticising health policy can be career kamikaze for NHS managers or civil servants, those people in organisations such as the NHS Confederation and the King's Fund have a clear - and luxurious - licence to say the \"unsayable\". A few years ago, Jennifer Dixon, director of health care policy at the King's Fund, published an article which revealed that GP fundholders received disproportionately more funding than their non-fundholder colleagues. The article was highlighted by the media, and became the basis for an inquiry into fundholding by the Commons health select committee. The then health secretary Virginia Bottomley was livid. Says Dr Dixon: \"There are times when you score a direct hit.\" The former public health doctor contrasts this with her spell as an \"insider\" on secondment to the Department of Health as policy adviser to former NHS chief executive Alan Langlands between 1998 and 2000. \"In the department you are less pro-active. Most of your work is non-attributable to you, and although you help develop policy, political advisers tend to formulate the new ideas. At the King's Fund I can be much more my own person.\" Dr Dixon also had a spell in academia. \"The difference between here and the University is that here if you appear in the newspaper, that is seen as part of your job, which is refreshing. In the University it is seen as rather eccentric.\" Although she sometimes misses the contact with patients that frontline NHS clinical work brings, she has no regrets about moving to the King's Fund. \"I did not find medicine intellectually stretching; you can easily get stuck on a kind of tramline and feel you cannot do anything else.\" Nigel Edwards, director of policy at the NHS Confederation, says: \"I enjoyed my time as a health service manager, but as a manager you spend so much time on day-to-day stuff, and less on fundamental policy questions. I was more interested in the 'big picture' stuff.\" The confederation represents NHS trusts and health authorities, lobbies ministers on their behalf, briefs its members and the media on policy issues, and disseminates good practice. It counts among its most recent successes the work it did on the NHS plan in spring 2000. It sat on government working groups and ended up steering several confederation ideas - including human resources policy and ambulatory care hospitals - into the final document. Mr Edwards points out that although on occasion it has been critical of government policy - such as over the private finance initiative - it does not have the total freedom of independently-funded organisations like the King's Fund. Getting to the heart of policy formulation requires a difficult political balancing act - speaking honestly about members' concerns and yet securing and maintaining the trust of ministers. \"Do you go onto the Today programme and say the NHS is failing and in meltdown - and then find that your appointment with the minister is cancelled? That is death for an organisation like ours. If that means sometimes biting your lips then we have to do it.\"",

The student, meanwhile, claims that it was Motion who was harassing her. Motion's wife, the writer and critic Jan Dalley, is reported as saying the student had a \"crush\" on her husband which turned \"sour\", and also that \"crushy-type relationships\" are bound to happen to creative writing tutors because \"they talk about emotions\".</p> <p>I teach on Manchester University's MA course in novel writing. A few years ago, before getting my first publishing deal, I was a student on the East Anglia course, and know just how high the stakes are for writing students. Studying on a creative writing course is not like studying 20th-century history or astrophysics. It is deeply personal and highly precarious. Writing is striptease: even when not writing about your own life and experiences, you are constantly revealing yourself on the page; you are showing something about your obsessions and preoccupations; about the creative energy which drives you. Being accepted on to one of these courses is a real buzz - someone \"in the know\" is saying that your writing is attractive; that you are attractive.</p> <p>Most creative writing courses feature \"the workshop\", in which students disclose their work to the tutors and the group. Workshops are terrifying - you feel that you are really laying yourself on the line. Sometimes you emerge feeling as though you have been ripped apart. Other times you might be showered with praise: \"I love your work. Your writing is so passionate, so gorgeous and sensual. I just think you're so clever.\" It's hardly surprising that in such a highly charged environment, students get crushes on their tutors - and vice versa.</p> <p>The creative writing tutor is a charismatic figure. You are a published novelist (or poet), which means you know \"the secret\". Your praise means so much more than that of fellow students because it comes from this position of secret knowledge. The students know that you must believe some of them to be better writers than others, and occasionally students vie to be \"the one\" whose work you truly rate.</p> <p>For so many of them the creative writing course is about dream fulfilment - and you are the one with the power. Many tutors play favourites, giving more attention to a few talented students than to the rest - taking the chosen ones to restaurants and bars, visiting them in their homes . This can be the start of something - perhaps gossip; or perhaps something more. It is very easy to take advantage of people who look up to you; who hang on your every word.</p> <p>It is not always the student who pursues the tutor. Contrary to popular belief, writers do not typically lead glamorous lives. The writer spends most of his or her time in a tiny room, trying to force words out on to a blank page or screen. It is a lonely and frequently boring existence, and sometimes you wonder if anyone is actually out there listening to you. Think how wonderful it is, then, to emerge into a room full of people who think you are something special. Some of these people might be genuinely talented - a fresh talent that hasn't yet slipped into the mire of cynicism and bitterness in which so many seasoned writers languish. And some of them might be young and nubile .</p> <p>Now, I'm sure - and, in fact, hope - that any of my current and former students reading this article will have just laughed their cornflakes across the table. We're by no means all \"at it\". But there are far too many potentially libellous stories circulating around the \"creative writing circuit\" - and featuring a wide array of tutors and students from MA courses, short residential writing courses and writing workshops at literary festivals - for them all to be complete fabrication. Writing teachers are the new Rodins and Gauguins. Sex with students is like sex with the life model or apprentice in their day - just good bohemian fun. There are lots of people \"at it\" out there. You know who you are.</p> <p>It is easier for male tutors who wish to indulge in this particular form of recreation than it is for heterosexual women - mainly because there are always so many more women studying creative writing. The class I am currently teaching has three men and 10 women, which is typical. Most of the stories you hear are about young female students and older male teachers, and this of course fits in rather neatly with all the old cliches. But women tutors are also subject to temptation.</p> <p>Until very recently all this talk of sex with students and of certain colourful characters who \"play the circuit\" seemed remote to me. But a few months ago, I was employed to teach a one-off creative writing workshop. In my class there was a very beautiful, friendly and articulate man who was about 10 years my junior. He was really rather lovely; he looked like a Greek god and he wrote very well.</p> <p>Nothing improper happened, I hasten to say - I didn't so much as go for a cup of tea with him - but for the first time in my teaching experience, I felt certain that if I had wanted something to happen with this man, it would have done. Never mind that under normal circumstances he was too beautiful to be attracted to someone like me : I had the lure of the published novelist that day, and he was giving clear signals that he was available. The incident made me feel strange. It made me understand how easily these things can happen, and I had never actually understood it before.</p> <p>Of course, so many of the rumours are unfounded, and some of them are very sad. Writing classes can and should be fun. I happen to think my students are a nice bunch of people and I enjoy the odd pint with them after class - with all of the students who turn up at the pub, not just a hand-picked few.</p> <p>Writing students seem to expect to get to know their tutors on a personal level, perhaps more so than on other courses, and I'm sure that some of the most useful things I have said to my students have been in the bar. Does this mean I am laying myself open to allegations? I would hate to have to be frosty and distant in order to be beyond suspicion, but is this sufficiently prudent? I know of other novelists who have taken the decision to withdraw entirely from social interaction with students after bad experiences with aspiring writers who became infatuated and evolved into semi-stalkers. These people talk about \"the need to be careful\". What a shame it would be if this turned us all into a bunch of stiffs.</p> <p>\u0095 Cheet by Anna Davis will be published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton on May 21, priced \u00a310.99</p>",

Many tutors play favourites, giving more attention to a few talented students than to the rest - taking the chosen ones to restaurants and bars, visiting them in their homes . This can be the start of something - perhaps gossip; or perhaps something more. It is very easy to take advantage of people who look up to you; who hang on your every word. It is not always the student who pursues the tutor. Contrary to popular belief, writers do not typically lead glamorous lives. The writer spends most of his or her time in a tiny room, trying to force words out on to a blank page or screen. It is a lonely and frequently boring existence, and sometimes you wonder if anyone is actually out there listening to you. Think how wonderful it is, then, to emerge into a room full of people who think you are something special. Some of these people might be genuinely talented - a fresh talent that hasn't yet slipped into the mire of cynicism and bitterness in which so many seasoned writers languish. And some of them might be young and nubile . Now, I'm sure - and, in fact, hope - that any of my current and former students reading this article will have just laughed their cornflakes across the table. We're by no means all \"at it\". But there are far too many potentially libellous stories circulating around the \"creative writing circuit\" - and featuring a wide array of tutors and students from MA courses, short residential writing courses and writing workshops at literary festivals - for them all to be complete fabrication. Writing teachers are the new Rodins and Gauguins. Sex with students is like sex with the life model or apprentice in their day - just good bohemian fun. There are lots of people \"at it\" out there. You know who you are. It is easier for male tutors who wish to indulge in this particular form of recreation than it is for heterosexual women - mainly because there are always so many more women studying creative writing. The class I am currently teaching has three men and 10 women, which is typical. Most of the stories you hear are about young female students and older male teachers, and this of course fits in rather neatly with all the old cliches. But women tutors are also subject to temptation. Until very recently all this talk of sex with students and of certain colourful characters who \"play the circuit\" seemed remote to me. But a few months ago, I was employed to teach a one-off creative writing workshop. In my class there was a very beautiful, friendly and articulate man who was about 10 years my junior. He was really rather lovely; he looked like a Greek god and he wrote very well. Nothing improper happened, I hasten to say - I didn't so much as go for a cup of tea with him - but for the first time in my teaching experience, I felt certain that if I had wanted something to happen with this man, it would have done. Never mind that under normal circumstances he was too beautiful to be attracted to someone like me : I had the lure of the published novelist that day, and he was giving clear signals that he was available. The incident made me feel strange. It made me understand how easily these things can happen, and I had never actually understood it before. Of course, so many of the rumours are unfounded, and some of them are very sad. Writing classes can and should be fun. I happen to think my students are a nice bunch of people and I enjoy the odd pint with them after class - with all of the students who turn up at the pub, not just a hand-picked few. Writing students seem to expect to get to know their tutors on a personal level, perhaps more so than on other courses, and I'm sure that some of the most useful things I have said to my students have been in the bar. Does this mean I am laying myself open to allegations? I would hate to have to be frosty and distant in order to be beyond suspicion, but is this sufficiently prudent? I know of other novelists who have taken the decision to withdraw entirely from social interaction with students after bad experiences with aspiring writers who became infatuated and evolved into semi-stalkers. These people talk about \"the need to be careful\". What a shame it would be if this turned us all into a bunch of stiffs. \u0095 Cheet by Anna Davis will be published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton on May 21, priced \u00a310.99",

The report, Big Loans, Bigger Problems, will also embarrass David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, who has attempted to bury student funding as an election issue by ruling out top-up fees. </p> <p>The report notes the massive increase in student debt in the US dur ing the 1990s. Federal government spending on loans rose from $15bn in 1992-93 to \u00a335bn last year. \"More students are increasingly dependent on loans to pay for their education,\" say the authors Tracey King and Ivan Frishberg. \"More students are taking out loans and students are taking out larger loans.\" </p> <p>The number of loans rose from 5.1m to 9.4m and the average annual loan increased from $3,186 to $4,041 as the purchasing power of student grants declined. </p> <p>The PIRG groups based in different American states campaign in the public interest against lobby groups. This report urges Congress to be wary of proposals from private colleges and some of the more expensive public universities to increase the size of loans that students are allowed to take out. At present a student in col lege for five years can borrow $22,625 (about \u00a316,000) from the federal government. </p> <p>While some universities argue that loan limits have not kept up with college costs and students are being forced to turn to more expensive private loans, King and Frishberg argue that students are already getting into more debt than they realise. </p> <p>Students were frequently shocked on graduation to discover their debt was much larger than they expected or planned, they said: \"If they do not understand loan costs they may borrow more than they can afford and experience difficulty repaying their loans.\" Their survey of 1,012 students from 55 colleges found eight out of 10 students underestimated their total loans by an average of nearly $5,000. Many of them failed to understand the impact that interest payments would have on their total debt. </p> <p>In the UK students can take out loans of up to \u00a33,725 a year (outside London) and are expected to repay them after leaving their course at the rate of 9% of any income over \u00a310,000. The Student Loans Company collects the original sum loaned plus inflation, so that although students benefit from a zero real interest rate, their debt does increase during their course and after graduation. </p> <p>Half of all students do not pay the tuition fees that were introduced by the Labour government in 1997, while some pay only part of the \u00a31,050 fee. But evidence to the Commons select committee on education showed that the poorest students were running up the largest debts to cover living costs. </p> <p>Professor Claire Callender, of South Bank University, who carried out a major study of student debt for the Department for Education and Employment, found evidence that both further and higher education students were underestimating the costs of following their courses. Of university students she surveyed, half disagreed with the statement \"My financial situation is better than expected\". </p> <p>The problem in the UK, she said, was less to do with course fees than the hidden costs of travel, books and equipment: \"Students don't understand what their costs will be.\" </p> <p>The PIRG report argues for more grant aid based on the need to help low income students graduate without incurring huge levels of debt. In the US student debts have increasingly become an issue, and leading universities such as Princeton have scrapped or reduced tuition fees to attract good students.</p>",

At present a student in col lege for five years can borrow $22,625 (about \u00a316,000) from the federal government. While some universities argue that loan limits have not kept up with college costs and students are being forced to turn to more expensive private loans, King and Frishberg argue that students are already getting into more debt than they realise. Students were frequently shocked on graduation to discover their debt was much larger than they expected or planned, they said: \"If they do not understand loan costs they may borrow more than they can afford and experience difficulty repaying their loans.\" Their survey of 1,012 students from 55 colleges found eight out of 10 students underestimated their total loans by an average of nearly $5,000. Many of them failed to understand the impact that interest payments would have on their total debt. In the UK students can take out loans of up to \u00a33,725 a year (outside London) and are expected to repay them after leaving their course at the rate of 9% of any income over \u00a310,000. The Student Loans Company collects the original sum loaned plus inflation, so that although students benefit from a zero real interest rate, their debt does increase during their course and after graduation. Half of all students do not pay the tuition fees that were introduced by the Labour government in 1997, while some pay only part of the \u00a31,050 fee. But evidence to the Commons select committee on education showed that the poorest students were running up the largest debts to cover living costs. Professor Claire Callender, of South Bank University, who carried out a major study of student debt for the Department for Education and Employment, found evidence that both further and higher education students were underestimating the costs of following their courses. Of university students she surveyed, half disagreed with the statement \"My financial situation is better than expected\". The problem in the UK, she said, was less to do with course fees than the hidden costs of travel, books and equipment: \"Students don't understand what their costs will be.\" The PIRG report argues for more grant aid based on the need to help low income students graduate without incurring huge levels of debt. In the US student debts have increasingly become an issue, and leading universities such as Princeton have scrapped or reduced tuition fees to attract good students.",

But how can they be so sure their memory of what they heard and saw is accurate? If they read the findings of a recent joint study carried out by Dr Catherine O Fritz of Bolton Institute with colleagues at Lancaster University and the University of California, Los Angeles, in the British Journal of Psychology they might start to panic. And that really would hinder their swotting. </p> <p>Of course, the researchers didn't call it swotting, but they set out to investigate whether revision simply reinforces the mistakes and misunderstandings students have picked up first time round. </p> <p>In the 1950s, Harry Kay at the Institute of Experimental Psychology, Oxford University, found in a series of experiments that \"one of the major difficulties experienced by adult subjects was that of amending the mistakes which they themselves had introduced into their learning, so much so that in many instances the feature of the whole learning process was this unlearning of wrongly acquired responses.\" </p> <p>In one experiment Kay read out twice two prose passages totalling 300 words to a group of 10 adults aged between 18 and 35 years in a psychology class at the Cambridgeshire Technical College. They then listened to further unconnected material and five minutes later were asked to attempt written recall of the original passages. Kay then read out the two passages again. A second recall attempt was made by the students a week later and the original passages read out once again at the end of the session. This procedure was repeated at weekly intervals in another five sessions and then four months later after a vacation. </p> <p>Kay admitted his procedures were unusual in experimental research but were very similar to much educational practice in which tutors give \"instruction in a subject, then make some examination of what has been learned, correcting it, followed by further testing at some subsequent date\". </p> <p>You would expect that, with early feedback, the students would have corrected their own mistakes. You'd be wrong. Kay measured both the number of words accurately reproduced and the meaningful content of their efforts. At each recall session, the typical student reproduced very accurately what they had recalled before, irrespective of whether the recall had been correct or incorrect. None of them learnt from the repeated presentations of the correct passages. </p> <p>An incorrect word that had appeared on all of a student's recall attempts in the first three weeks had an 80% chance of occurring again in week four. There was little improvement in recall between the first and seventh weekly sessions. </p> <p>Kay found the persistent unconscious assumptions and impressions they made to help them make sense of the information became a barrier to accurate recall. This was illustrated by the second world war pilot still engaged in flights over Germany who four times reproduced the \"varied political opinions of mankind\" as \"varied as the political opinions expressed in Mein Kampf\". </p> <p>Thankfully, for students, reproducing 300 words of prose, verbatim, is not something they have to do very often. But when measuring a student's understanding of content, Kay found the first attempt established the content of the passage. Although the first version was fairly accurate (on average 70% correct), there was little change in understanding from one version to the next. They tended to repeat the preceding version. </p> <p>Depressingly, Dr Fritz's new research finds that Kay was right. But this time the experimenters went further and tested three possible explanations for the failure of further learning, using 57 students enrolled on an introductory psychology course at the University of California: </p> <p>\u0095 The first explanation tested was based on the assumption that in tests after the first one, the students are basing their recall on their memory of previous tests, rather than previous presentations. The students were split up into four groups and three passages on architectural mouldings, air traffic control and the patent process were read to them. Special efforts were made to warn participants \"against basing their recall on their previous recall efforts and specifically directing them to base their recall on their passages\". It was no use; there was no noticeable improvement in recall. </p> <p>\u0095 Second, the researchers tried to find out if making each presentation more distinctive would improve the amount of material remembered. To test this, one group saw four different readers during the experiment, each of which had different styles of presentation. Once again the researchers found little improvement in what had been remembered. </p> <p>\u0095 The third hypothesis was the possibility that \"during the presentations that follow a test, learners fail to notice information omitted from or inconsistent with their previous reports\". To try to eliminate this effect, attention in one group was focused on areas that would benefit from further learning for each participant. </p> <p>An omissions and errors page was provided and each student was asked to make a tally mark in the appropriate column whenever they noticed, while listening to the passage, that they had omitted some information from the previous test or made an error. New pages were provided for each presentation following each test. Despite all the effort, drawing attention to omissions and errors actually led to poorer, not better, recall. </p> <p>Dr Fritz and her colleagues are rather stumped by their findings that the \"failure-of-further-learning effect appears to be robust and not easily overcome\". They also highlight the fact that the existing accounts of human memory would not lead us to predict the failure of further learning. They ask a whole series of questions that need answers: </p> <p>\u0095 Is further learning failure limited to some particular level of initial performance? </p> <p>\u0095 Does it apply to learning of different sorts of materials? </p> <p>\u0095 Is it to some degree a function of a learner's expectations about their performance? </p> <p>But the researchers are certain that overcoming the failure of further learning is crucial for effective education and training.

The Tories and Liberal Democrats between them would pick up some of the extra votes, with 11 per cent of teachers saying they would vote for William Hague - compared with nine per cent last time, and 19 per cent for Charles Kennedy, up from 17 per cent in 1997.The sample consisted of 1,000 members of the NASUWT (which has 186,000 members in total) who were interviewed in mid-March.",

      "body": "<p>Rosie is small, slight and very pretty. She looks even younger than 25 years old; it's hard to believe that she has four sons, aged seven, six, four and 19 months. She left school when she was 11; she was, she says, truanting, or bunking, all the time. Now she's back at college studying for City and Guilds certificates in maths and English, though it's a struggle given how little free time she has. She wants her children to do better at school than she did. </p> <p>Vicky, who is 20, has a daughter of three. She officially left school a week before her 16th birthday, but in fact she missed the whole of her fifth year. She was put in a class for badly-behaved children, though she'd been diagnosed as dyslexic, and the experience was too much for her, so she simply didn't go to school. Vicky believes her daughter is already shaping up to be \"brainier\" than she was; and wants to help her achieve. </p> <p>Kelly is 21, and has three children under the age of four. She hated school and left at the age of 14. She says she was always bullied and her education suffered; it's embarrassing, she says, that she can't spell well enough to fill in forms. She wants her children to be \"really good\" at school. </p> <p>All three of them have been helped by a special course run by Ferries and Port Sunlight Family Groups on the Wirral as part of its parenting classes programme. The Successful Learning pilot scheme aims to break down parents' barriers to learning, because these in turn undermine their own children's potential to do well at school. If parents lack basic skills themselves, they can feel humiliated and confused and unable to help their children. And if they have felt let down by their teachers, they pass that on. It is, says Jean Robb of Successful Learning, a vicious circle. \"If parents have had a disruptive attitude in school, those belligerent attitudes are carried over when they have to deal with their children's teachers,\" she says. </p> <p>It's important to explain to parents, says Jean, that if they don't play their role in a supportive way so that teachers and students can play theirs in turn, then disorder is the result. \"Then everyone feels confused, disappointed, irritated and exhausted,\" she says. Many of the parents that Jean has been working with left school with very negative views of education. \"They'd been getting into trouble, they'd been told they were thick, they felt it wasn't worth going,\" says Elaine Banks of the Ferries and Port Sunlight Family Groups. \"We want to break that cycle, give them the confidence to keep going and help their own children.\" </p> <p>The effectiveness of the Successful Learning course, she says, is striking. Each of the nine smaller groups within the Family Groups has had four two-hour sessions with Jean and her colleague Hilary Letts. \"It has been wonderful to see how they have blossomed,\" says Elaine Banks. \"One mother who had always struggled with spelling was standing up in front of the class spelling a 13-letter word forwards and backwards.\" She is referring to Kelly, who says of her achievement: \"I just couldn't believe it; I went around smiling all day.\" </p> <p>So how is it done? The emphasis of Jean and Hilary's work is on learning how to learn; on breaking tasks down into manageable smaller tasks, then building them back up. One morning last week in a church hall in New Ferry, seven mothers had begun their session by making up a couple of child's jigsaws, one showing a country farm and one showing a city park. Easy enough to do; but, guided by Jean and Hilary, they were then using the completed jigsaws to illustrate all kinds of classroom lessons.

      "bodyText": "Rosie is small, slight and very pretty. She looks even younger than 25 years old; it's hard to believe that she has four sons, aged seven, six, four and 19 months. She left school when she was 11; she was, she says, truanting, or bunking, all the time. Now she's back at college studying for City and Guilds certificates in maths and English, though it's a struggle given how little free time she has. She wants her children to do better at school than she did. Vicky, who is 20, has a daughter of three. She officially left school a week before her 16th birthday, but in fact she missed the whole of her fifth year. She was put in a class for badly-behaved children, though she'd been diagnosed as dyslexic, and the experience was too much for her, so she simply didn't go to school. Vicky believes her daughter is already shaping up to be \"brainier\" than she was; and wants to help her achieve. Kelly is 21, and has three children under the age of four. She hated school and left at the age of 14. She says she was always bullied and her education suffered; it's embarrassing, she says, that she can't spell well enough to fill in forms. She wants her children to be \"really good\" at school. All three of them have been helped by a special course run by Ferries and Port Sunlight Family Groups on the Wirral as part of its parenting classes programme. The Successful Learning pilot scheme aims to break down parents' barriers to learning, because these in turn undermine their own children's potential to do well at school. If parents lack basic skills themselves, they can feel humiliated and confused and unable to help their children. And if they have felt let down by their teachers, they pass that on. It is, says Jean Robb of Successful Learning, a vicious circle. \"If parents have had a disruptive attitude in school, those belligerent attitudes are carried over when they have to deal with their children's teachers,\" she says. It's important to explain to parents, says Jean, that if they don't play their role in a supportive way so that teachers and students can play theirs in turn, then disorder is the result. \"Then everyone feels confused, disappointed, irritated and exhausted,\" she says. Many of the parents that Jean has been working with left school with very negative views of education. \"They'd been getting into trouble, they'd been told they were thick, they felt it wasn't worth going,\" says Elaine Banks of the Ferries and Port Sunlight Family Groups. \"We want to break that cycle, give them the confidence to keep going and help their own children.\" The effectiveness of the Successful Learning course, she says, is striking. Each of the nine smaller groups within the Family Groups has had four two-hour sessions with Jean and her colleague Hilary Letts. \"It has been wonderful to see how they have blossomed,\" says Elaine Banks. \"One mother who had always struggled with spelling was standing up in front of the class spelling a 13-letter word forwards and backwards.\" She is referring to Kelly, who says of her achievement: \"I just couldn't believe it; I went around smiling all day.\" So how is it done? The emphasis of Jean and Hilary's work is on learning how to learn; on breaking tasks down into manageable smaller tasks, then building them back up. One morning last week in a church hall in New Ferry, seven mothers had begun their session by making up a couple of child's jigsaws, one showing a country farm and one showing a city park. Easy enough to do; but, guided by Jean and Hilary, they were then using the completed jigsaws to illustrate all kinds of classroom lessons. Hilary asked them to find similarities and differences between the two pictures. \"This is something children have to do all through school,\" she explained. \"They might have to compare life as a Roman with life as a Greek, for example.\" The women began by making a list of things that were the same in each picture, then by making a list of things that were different. Then Jean asked them to describe the similarities more fully, using prepositions such as \"beside\" or \"under\". \"Lots of children can't write down their ideas because they don't understand about prepositions,\" she said. \"But once they can do that, they're away.\" It was a lively class, with plenty of humour; within a few minutes adjectives and relationships between people had been added to the mix. \"The black and white dog is pulling the boy over the grass, across the path, and into the pond,\" said Karen, one of the mums, triumphantly. \"Do you see how it's not difficult, you don't need a huge vocabulary?\" asked Jean. \"Once you can describe something relative to something else, you've got a full and rich use of language.

I hate her too.'?\" There were nods of recognition all round the room. \"Saying something is wrong isn't personal.

They are enthusiastic about the methods they are using and keen to take them home. \"I'm not very good at maths,\" said Karen, 35.

      "body": "<p>David Thompson literally froze when he heard the words \"foot and mouth outbreak\" on local radio; and his brief paralysis has been grimly justified. Closing in silently on his high school at Haydon Bridge, the disease is playing havoc with everything good, hard-working and Ofsted-praised in Northumberland's farming valley of the South Tyne. </p> <p>\"We lost a third of our students immediately,\" says the long-serving headteacher, whose beetle brows and craggy face make comparisons with a shepherd inevitable. His flock of pupils covers the biggest catchment area of any school in England, miles of forest and moor from Spadeadam (the eerie old launchpad for the Army's Blue Streak rockets) to the leadmines at Alston in Cumbria. </p> <p>Imprisoned at various lonely points on this great map are sixth-formers tackling A-levels, younger GCSE students and the poor guinea pigs of year 12 who have AS-levels and key skills to contend with. </p> <p>Looking horribly like wreckage are their not-quite-finished modules of exam coursework: painstaking studies of a river which can no longer be visited; practical work on lambing at the school's 74-hectare (183-acre) farm, now strictly out of bounds. </p> <p>There is plenty of lunch-break football, joking and even a positive, crisis-born community spirit at the comprehensive, but these are not good times for a keen 16-year-old like Graeme Fowler. For a start, he had to miss the Northumberland schools rugby cup-final (Haydon won, but only because they were the away team in a 12-12 draw); and then there's not much Russian spoken on the Cumbrian farm where he lives with his parents. </p> <p>\"Russian's one of my AS-levels and I need to practice for the oral\", he says, \"but if I have to stay at home (and foot and mouth is now very close to his parents' farm) it's going to be hard to 'phone in to try to catch my teacher.\" </p> <p>Six staff and more than 300 of Haydon Bridge's 750 students didn't come back to classes after half-term when the disease broke - the start of the whole epidemic is only ten miles down the South Tyne at the notorious pig unit in Heddon-on-the-Wall. </p> <p>This year's musical, Grease, was promptly postponed because so few of the putative Californian teenagers could rehearse; and librarian Avril Kirsopp was soon bulk-buying stamps. </p> <p>\"We're spending \u00a320 a day on them now,\" she says, coordinating an emergency scheme of sent-out homework which has seen all Haydon's staff working overtime. On commandeered tables in the library, yellow files are filled for absent year 10s, red ones for year 11s and so on. </p> <p>\"Thank goodness that we still have an efficient rural post service,\" says David Thompson, as completed work arrives back in the school's stamped, addressed envelopes. \"Local postmen probably know all our kids and the importance of the exams they're taking.\" </p> <p>Empty desks were gradually filled after the initial, instinctive \"don't leave the farm\" reaction of many parents, but last week absentees were climbing back over 100 again. The list of cancellations meanwhile grows: the school's enterprising trip to Kili manjaro this summer can no longer raise sponsorship, as normal, by timed scrambles up Skiddaw, Helvellyn and Scafell Pike. And the budget is facing other squeezes. </p> <p>In an area where the next bus often comes 24 hours later and the nearest teenager can be four miles away, Haydon Bridge takes 62 weekly boarders. At weekends their wing, Ridley Hall, is hired out to field trips from all over Britain to earn money; but not now. </p> <p>\"We've either had cancellations or we've had to tell them not to come because of spreading foot and mouth,\" says Mr Thompson. On top of the unexpected stamp and envelope fund, that's a loss of at least \u00a38,000. </p> <p>Everyone is under the foot and mouth strain, too. The head was on the 'phone last night for a long talk with a key parent-governor farmer, and then fielded two more foot and mouth calls before going home at 9.45pm. </p> <p>Students like Thomas Carrick, who is debating whether to stay with friends or relatives (like several dozen Haydon students) rather than risk being trapped on his farm during A-lev els, also can't get the disease out of their heads. </p> <p>\"It's always on your mind,\" says the 18-year-old, who is aiming to read biology at Leeds university. \"I'm anxious about dropping grades, but one trouble is that all the people I might stay with are in farming as well.\" </p> <p>Alice Pattinson, another 18-year-old who hopes to study agriculture at Harper Adams college in Shropshire, is on a different rack. She lives with her parents' dread that a sheep flock reared and carefully bred by the family for 80 years may be slaughtered. </p> <p>Katie Teasdale, similarly deep in A-levels, wakes every morning to remember that her parents' three holiday cottages haven't got a single summer let. </p> <p>Meanwhile James Johnson, 17, who is trying to retrieve all he can of A-level geography projects, has to spend revision time helping with his parents' farm. </p> <p>\"We're lambing now and we've usually got two part-time workers, but because of foot and mouth restrictions they can't come, so obviously you pitch in,\" he says. </p> <p>Like the school budget, students' own small economies are also being devastated. Alice's farm is on the Roman wall, within sight of the closed English Heritage fort at Housesteads and the barred National Trust walk to Steel Rigg, the most photographed stretch of the wall. </p> <p>\"The holiday trade, where we all get jobs to save for university, is just packing up,\" she says. Her own part-time waitressing work has only been saved because Ministry of Agriculture vets and slaughtering staff have booked a local hotel en bloc. </p> <p>Haydon Bridge is stuck in for a long haul, which means major curriculum shifts for staff like Ian Hopper, the school's senior teacher, who is trying to find alternative places for fieldwork as the countryside shuts down. </p> <p>He says: \"We're having to look at Hexham (the only town for miles) to do an urban study for geography GCSE. But the kids haven't done settlement as part of their classroom coursework. That's the sort of juggling going on.\" </p> <p>All eyes are on the three exam boards which deal with the school, and which have already sanctioned unavoidable exams for pupils trapped at home, with timing and invigilation based on trust. Heather Howard, head of English, says: \"We have to hope they realise the full extent of the crisis. They've offered to delay modules, but that means that students will face extra work at exam time this summer.

Friday March 2 268 absentees, or 40% of the student roll. Final preparations are made for posting work home. Staff, as always, respond magnificently. Saturday/Sunday, March 3-4 All the community is within a restricted area. A whole swathe of students, and six staff, could be absent for weeks rather than days. How ironic that information travels fast via the internet; many of our students not at all. Our longstanding pleas for improved IT facilities in this most rural area have often been ignored. Monday March 5 Contact is made with MAFF and the NFU. The County's Emergency Team confirm that students and staff can return to school, subject to specific restrictions and general common sense. Tuesday March 6 Still 40% away from school. Friday March 9 Only 160 students are absent, and all staff have reported back. Attention returns to the school budget which will not balance. It never does. As for the next week, or weeks - who knows? The staff will continue to enable the students to learn and to achieve, no matter what. David Thompson, headteacher",

In his introduction to this substantial anthology, Sweeney gives some insight into the inherent dilemmas and anxieties of the role. How much should he update the classic Faber collection published in the 1950s? Should children's verse necessarily have been written for children? He has resolved this by avoiding a thematic approach, showcasing the contemporary and the classic in the context of imaginative, artistic and intellectual discovery. </p> <p><strong> Heathrow Nights</strong><br>Jan Mark<br> (Signature Hodder, \u00a34.99)<br> <strong> Age:</strong> 12-17 yrs <br> </p> <p>When he's not being benignly heedless, Russell ponders the parallels between Hamlet and himself, both of them outraged stepsons. His insightful questioning of the play is woven through a plot that finds him wandering around Heathrow to escape punishment for a childish prank. This is an excellent parallel text for those reading Hamlet - humane, often witty, and stimulating. Its perspective should endear it to teachers tackling the play for the umpteenth time with a new set of puzzled faces, offering fresh angles from which to view that tragic hero alongside a perceptive depiction of the rougher edges of grief.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The New Faber Book of Children's Verse Edited by Matthew Sweeney, illustrated by Sara Fanelli (Faber, \u00a316.99) Age: 9-15 yrs To be asked to compile an anthology must be among the loveliest of literary invitations, but to do the job properly must be one of the most daunting. In his introduction to this substantial anthology, Sweeney gives some insight into the inherent dilemmas and anxieties of the role. How much should he update the classic Faber collection published in the 1950s? Should children's verse necessarily have been written for children? He has resolved this by avoiding a thematic approach, showcasing the contemporary and the classic in the context of imaginative, artistic and intellectual discovery. Heathrow Nights Jan Mark (Signature Hodder, \u00a34.99) Age: 12-17 yrs When he's not being benignly heedless, Russell ponders the parallels between Hamlet and himself, both of them outraged stepsons. His insightful questioning of the play is woven through a plot that finds him wandering around Heathrow to escape punishment for a childish prank. This is an excellent parallel text for those reading Hamlet - humane, often witty, and stimulating. Its perspective should endear it to teachers tackling the play for the umpteenth time with a new set of puzzled faces, offering fresh angles from which to view that tragic hero alongside a perceptive depiction of the rougher edges of grief.",

But now this is about to start happening, fears are rumbling in the universities due to carry out the training that the qualifications they are being asked to provide are sub-standard. </p> <p>The universities are also worried that they could lose potential students to new, shorter and more inexpensive training courses being developed in colleges. </p> <p>It has long been compulsory for teachers in schools to be qualified in the skills of teaching as well as in their subject specialisms. Up until now, however, this has not been the case for further education lecturers in England. It is estimated that more than 37% of the 48,000 full-time further education teachers in England do not possess a postgraduate certificate in education or certificate in education or the equivalent. </p> <p>Moreover, of the 79,000 part-time teachers, the proportion holding any recognised teaching qualification could be as low as 40%. More than half the further education curriculum, it is estimated, is being taught by part-timers. </p> <p>Over recent years inspection reports from the outgoing Further Education Funding Council have noted that some areas of teaching in colleges needed improving. So in a bid to raise stan dards the government decided that, from September, all lecturers in England, including those who teach basic skills such as numeracy and literacy to adults, should have a teaching qualification. This, it is believed, will help to raise student achievement and improve retention. </p> <p>The further education national training organisation, Fento, which is responsible for devising teaching and learning standards in England and Wales, conducted research to determine what kind of new qualifications might be required. The government then consulted the colleges, universities, awarding bodies and other interested parties on Fento's proposals. In November at the funding council's AGM, Baroness Tessa Blackstone, the higher education minister, announced a proposed new qualifications framework. </p> <p>This requires all new lecturers in England to obtain an appropriate teaching qualification. Colleges will also be given financial help towards getting unqualified staff qualified. Full-time and fractional (employed on a proportion of a full-time contract) teachers will need to get a certificate in education (FE) or equivalent. Part-time teachers will have to get a stage 1 or stage 2 qualification depending on the number of hours they teach. These qualifications are staged by breadth of competencies rather than academic levels. Ministers have decided that the entry qualification for new full-time teachers will be as intellectually rigorous as the first year of university study. In other words it will be an H1 -level qualification, the equivalent of level 4 in the national qualifications framework. H2 and H3 are the equivalents of the second and third years of university study, H5 is the equivalent of a PhD. </p> <p>Some 29 universities offer teacher training qualifications in further education and many have set up networks of franchise partnerships with more than 80 further education colleges. A significant number of these universities are now worried that they could lose parts of their teacher training work and that the depth of such training could be diluted in future. This is because under the new qualification arrangements other qualification providers, for example, City and Guilds and Edexcel, will also be able to create new H1-level training qualifications for full-time lecturers. </p> <p>So worried are some universities, in fact, that John Homewood, chair of the Universities' Council for the Education of Teachers' Post-16 Committee has just written to Baroness Blackstone to express concerns about how the new framework will be implemented. </p> <p>The government is making available up to \u00a380m from the Standards Fund in 2001-2 to match-fund half the cost of staff training in the colleges, \u00a395m in 2002-3 and \u00a3105m in 2003-4. Some universities fear that princi pals will prefer to train lecturers by sending them on new one-year, part-time courses leading to a H1-level qualification rather than on a two-year, part-time course in a university. At least one awarding body is thought to be working on a new qualification which colleges could offer instead. </p> <p>The universities are also concerned that the quality of training could be diluted. At present, most certificates of education are offered at H2, the level of a second-year course at university. Providers - noting that they would not have to provide such high-level training in future - might choose to reduce the intellectual challenge of their courses to H1 level. </p> <p> Before the minimum entry level was decided there had been some lobbying that the level of qualification for would-be full-time teachers should be set at H2-level. This would make it easier for a further education teacher to top up his or her qualifications to the H3-level qualification required of teachers in schools, ie, a BA Hons Education or a first degree with a PGCE. </p> <p>It would also have made it easier for lecturers and teachers to move back and forth between schools and colleges. At present you can qualify to be a schoolteacher and teach in further education, but lecturers qualified in further education cannot teach in schools. </p> <p>Homewood fears that other awarding bodies will develop new qualifications that are at H1-level, but are shorter and involve less studying than courses offered by the universities. These could then be licensed to further education colleges to stage on their own premises. </p> <p>\"If I were a principal I would be very tempted to send my lecturers to the course that took them away from the classroom for the least time,\" he said. </p> <p>\"And it could be staged at the college. Up until now people have either gone to a university to take a course or they have done a university-franchised course with an identical structure in a further education college.\" </p> <p>Developing a compulsory teacher qualification framework, he added, was a \"brilliant thing\" but he was worried about how it might be implemented. </p> <p>Veronica Windmill, Fento's Director of Standards and Qualifications, said: \"We are thrilled that the government is putting raising standards and further education back into the centre of the picture, because we feel that further education has been ignored for too long. </p> <p>\"We work with the universities and the awarding bodies and listen to what they say, because they are the people who create the qualifications.

This summer's bleddy awful. You think so? We 'ant 'ad no decent summer for five year. Actually it's been the warmest June since records began. Worr, rubbish! It's true. Mean temperatures are 0.8C more than the previous record month. They're mean temperatures all right. I don't think you quite understand. That's 'cos you talk like one of they weather people on the telly. Well, now you mention it, I am actually . . . Load of silly tossers! . . . a meteorologist. And what's that when it's at home? I'm one of those weather people. Really. Then mine's a pint. Er, right. But before you get one, tell me what use you are, you metallurgists? The role of the meteorologist is to study, understand and predict the behaviour of the weather. Understand and predict? Yes, we collect and analyse data to produce weather forecasts and research global patterns to predict long-term climate changes. And where do you do that then, Mars? No. The main employer of meteorologists in the UK is the Meteorological Office, the Met Office, which employs approximately 2,300 staff, half of whom are based at its head office in Bracknell. And what do they do with themselves all day? They produce nearly 3,000 forecasts every day for a variety of clients, including the armed forces, local authorities and the National Severe Weather Warning Service. 3,000!? So why do we get so much crappy weather? Don't blame us! Where do you get it all from? Much of the information we use comes from weather stations, satellites, observation platforms and aircraft. The data, which includes temperatures, humidity and wind speed, is transmitted via telecommunications to the Met Office.

We were delighted by the success of the project and would happily do it again if funding were made available.\" </p> <p>The project was Ryan's brainchild. He's an American by birth, but Irish by descent and has collected a huge array of folklore tales over the years. For the last 15 years or so has made a living going round the world telling them. After a one-off event with Rhoades-Brown went down a storm last year, he put together the idea of a longer tour and persuaded Southern Arts Board to stump up the cash for it. </p> <p>\"It was particularly great for the kids to have strong male role models involved,\" he says. \"Many boys grow up wanting to be professional footballers and they'll listen to what they have to say far more readily than they would their teachers. It's not just the boys who get a lot out of it; even though a lot of the stories are football based, the girls never got bored.\" </p> <p>But there's another group for whom story-telling has been a learning process. The Oxford first-team footballers. On one occasion Rhoades-Brown brought in the Welsh Under 21 international Rob Folland, Ross Wetherstone and John Shepherd to show that current players value reading, and that relaxing with a book before a big game can improve performance, but it was the players who went away with the education. </p> <p>\"Footballers have a comparatively short career,\" says Ryan, \"and most move on to jobs in coaching, the leisure industry, running a pub or public speaking. For all these careers, players will need good communication skills and telling stories to a bunch of schoolkids is great practice for the future.\" </p> <p>Rhoades-Brown couldn't agree more. \"When I was a youngster with Chelsea, I had almost no self-confidence and wouldn't say boo to anyone,\" he adds. \"These days I'm quite happy standing up in front of 500 kids at a school assembly.\" </p> <p>Ryan and Rhoades-Brown hope to repeat the experiment next year, and Ryan is also talking to Queens Park Rangers and Leyton Orient about similar projects. </p> <p>There's also a possible knock-on benefit for the rest of us.

On one occasion Rhoades-Brown brought in the Welsh Under 21 international Rob Folland, Ross Wetherstone and John Shepherd to show that current players value reading, and that relaxing with a book before a big game can improve performance, but it was the players who went away with the education. \"Footballers have a comparatively short career,\" says Ryan, \"and most move on to jobs in coaching, the leisure industry, running a pub or public speaking. For all these careers, players will need good communication skills and telling stories to a bunch of schoolkids is great practice for the future.\" Rhoades-Brown couldn't agree more. \"When I was a youngster with Chelsea, I had almost no self-confidence and wouldn't say boo to anyone,\" he adds. \"These days I'm quite happy standing up in front of 500 kids at a school assembly.\" Ryan and Rhoades-Brown hope to repeat the experiment next year, and Ryan is also talking to Queens Park Rangers and Leyton Orient about similar projects. There's also a possible knock-on benefit for the rest of us. The post-match interview of: \"At the end of the day it's a game of two halves and the lads done good,\" may soon be a distant memory.",

The fashion retailer has gained a reputation for flouting advertising regulations with its controversial FCUK campaign. The decision to impose the sanction follows an Advertising Standards Authority ruling that a poster campaign carrying the line \"fcukinkybugger\" was offensive and irresponsible. The decision means all French Connection advertising for the next two years will have to be approved by a committee of advertising experts before it can be carried by media owners under the self-regulatory system. The sanction was introduced by the ASA in 1998 as a deterrent to advertisers that persistently flouted the watchdog's rules. So far it has been applied to just 18 advertisers. These include among others Yves St Laurent, which was censured over a poster campaign for Opium perfume featuring a naked Sophie Dahl, and Gossard, the lingerie firm behind the Hello Boys adverts. The ASA said it had told French Connection in the past that \"fcuk\" should not be used in the company's advertising where it could be misinterpreted as \"fuck\". It added that it was concerned that the company had used such words in an advert that could be seen by children. Trevor Beattie, the brains behind the fcuk campaign, has repeatedly spoken out against the regulators for their attitude to the campaign - most notably when, earlier this year, a planned TV commercial was banned before it had even been shot.

      "bodyText": "China was doing its best to make George Bush sweat yesterday after the US president called on Beijing to arrange \"the prompt and safe return\" of the grounded American EP-3 spy plane and its 24-person crew from Hainan island following Sunday's mid-air clash with a Chinese jet. While Washington demanded that Beijing should free the naval surveillance plane and its crew without examining the aircraft's secret equipment, Chinese officials were in no hurry to oblige. Foreign ministry officials said that three American diplomats who travelled to Hainan from Beijing would only get their first access to the crew today, more than 48 hours after the incident. Meanwhile US officials complained that the Chinese had boarded the plane, which should be \"sovereign and immune\". Both sides struggled to avoid an uncontrolled escalation of rhetoric over the incident. But the cold war-style stand-off has sent a chill through relations between two countries which, until January, had described themselves as strategic partners and which now seem set for an era of confrontation. Three US navy destroyers were ordered to stay in the Hainan island area \"indefinitely\" rather than continue their journey from Hong Kong to Hawaii, officials said. Mr Bush huddled with his top foreign policy advisers at the White House yesterday before emerging to say that he was \"troubled by the lack of a timely Chinese response\" to the US demands. \"Failure of the Chinese government to react promptly to our request is inconsistent with standard diplomatic practice and the expressed desire of our countries for better relations,\" he said. The 24 Americans were officially reported safe, but Beijing's denial of immediate US access to the spy plane and its crew came as Chinese public opinion reacted angrily to Sunday's incident, in which the Chinese fighter jet crashed into the South China Sea.

The US says the Chinese fighter bumped into the American jet. The US crew was said to have been moved to a military guesthouse near Lingshui airfield while the plane was standing empty where it had landed.

Clocking Off, written by Paul Abbott, has been described by one critic as containing \"moral complexity, sophisticated psychology and plain good writing\". But it attracted only 5.8m viewers and 24% of audience share last night, according to unofficial overnight ratings. Clocking Off was moved to from its Sunday-night slot to Monday nights by BBC drama chiefs a few weeks ago after dramas like Rebel Heart and Love in a Cold Climate failed to ignite the ratings. It was moved despite protests from the writer and friendly advice from experts, including ITV drama boss Nick Elliott, that it should have stayed in the weekend slot. The first series won both critical acclaim and huge audiences of up to 11m viewers. But on its return, the drama had the bad fortune to have been positioned opposite Who Wants to be a Millionaire, which took 9.4m viewers, 39% of audience share on ITV. The BBC also suffered from the huge number of people who changed channels when EastEnders was over. When Lee Evans's sitcom So What Now? came on at 8.30pm, the BBC saw its audiences slump from 13.9m to 6.5m. This sank even further to just 5.8m when Clocking Off came on.

Some, like Tom Kite, Davis Love and Vijay Singh, have managed to discard it, although in Kite's case only after a lifetime of trying. </p> <p>He had spent much of that time spouting the clich\u00e9s that golfers in his position invariably pour forth: \"If I never win a major it won't affect my life one bit\" . . . \"I am more than happy with my career as it is and a major will make no difference\" . . . \"My family is far more important to me than any trophy . . .\" and so on. </p> <p>Then, when he finally did win the US Open, at Pebble Beach in 1992, he came into the interview area, heaved a huge sigh of relief and, with eyes full of tears, confessed that it meant the world to him. He never won another. </p> <p>For much of the time there has really been only one \"best never\", readily recognisable by his achievements, which led everyone to think that his winning of a major was only a matter of time. But such has been the surge in the game in recent years that there are now four men without a major in the world's top 10, 13 in the top 20 and 38 in the top 50. </p> <p>The ultimate \"best never\" tag could probably be attached to five or more players, any one of whom would be worthy of it, all of whom would be delighted to be rid of it. </p> <p>The current No2 is Phil Mickelson who, remarkably, has achieved that exalted status without winning a major. The American left-hander is an extraordinary golfer, technically with a flaw or two in his swing but with the kind of flair around the greens that can only be gifted, not learned. </p> <p>At the BellSouth event in Atlanta last week he hit a shot that amazed even knowledgeable commentators like Johnny Miller - twice a major winner himself - when, needing to chip a ball some 10 yards, he took a full swing with a wedge and slid the blade under the ball so deftly that it rose almost vertically. </p> <p>It flew about 30 feet into the air and feathered down right by the pin. Miller, who had been speculating that the best Mickelson could do would be to get within 20 feet, confessed he did not know how he had produced that shot. </p> <p>Mickelson smiled his \"gosh, crikey, look at that\" smile and went on to finish third. He is too talented not to win a major but is he hard enough to win one? </p> <p>For years - seven to be precise - Colin Montgomerie dominated the European game and anyone who saw him doing just that was certain that he would become a major champion. But so far the best the Scot has done is to get into two play-offs, one for the US Open and another for the US PGA, and lost both. </p> <p>There is no doubt that he is good enough to win at the highest level - he is a much, much better ball striker than many who have multiple majors to their names - but there is more to it than that. The Scot, as PG Wodehouse would have it, \"hears the roars of butterflies in adjoining meadows\" and, intelligent man though he is, has singularly failed to address and deal with this deficiency. </p> <p>David Duval is a man who has returned a 59 in the full glare of a US Tour event and he did it in the final round of a tournament to win it. There was a time, two years ago, when he seemed to be the only man with a chance of challenging Tiger Woods, and he got to No2 in the world. </p> <p>Now, through injury and loss of form, he is down to eighth and has withdrawn from three of his past five events. This week, though, he is full of confidence, saying he feels \"fresh\" because of enforced absences and, for a withdrawn and essentially non-communicative man, is talking a good game. </p> <p>Thomas Bjorn has quietly but very efficiently crept into the circle of those with whom the thought of winning a major can be associated. The Dane is not always good but, when he is, he is very, very good. He plays with a deadpan face, giving him an extremely serious look, and in Dubai this year played all four rounds with Woods. </p> <p>The American started out with rounds of 64, 64 but Bjorn remained unfazed and in the final round birdied the 17th to stand on the 18th tee level. He hit the perfect drive, Woods found position Z and Bjorn won by two shots. He has placed second and third in majors and a first may not be far away. </p> <p>Jesper Parnevik is a really good player who has twice had chances to win majors. At the 1994 Open, the first at Turnberry, after not looking at the leaderboard, he played the last thinking he needed a birdie when a par would have done. In straining for the birdie he bogeyed and lost to Nick Price. </p> <p>Then, in 1997, he was beaten by a fantastic putting display at Troon by Justin Leonard - the American missing eight of nine greens on the final nine but single putting almost mechanically. The Swede could, maybe should, have won both of those championships. If he ever does manage one, it is only to be hoped that he takes his cap off for the presentation. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Tiger Woods is the 11-8 favourite with William Hill </strong> .

She first became a household name as spoof geriatric chat-show host Mrs Merton, who managed to prick the pomposity of celebrities ranging from Michael Winner to Paul Daniel's wife Debbie McGee. The identity of the real woman behind the housecoat remained a mystery for a while, but once the show took off, Aherne was everywhere. The BBC was so keen to hang onto Mrs Merton that it agreed to allow Aherne to develop a BBC2 comedy in return for a third and fourth series. This show became the Royle Family, a critical and ratings success that in turn got promoted to BBC1. Aherne was also part of the team that created BBC2's Fast Show. But Ms Aherne never really took to being a celebrity - she eschewed the trappings of showbusiness and hated living in London. However, there was a time when she was rarely out of the headlines - mainly because of her generous behaviour at awards ceremonies and her tempestuous relationship with then husband Peter Hook. And at one stage she admitted herself to a rehabilitation unit, but within a year was back on form wowing audiences and BBC bosses with the Royle Family. At the time it was just the remedy BBC bosses were looking for - a critically acclaimed series that became a mass hit. However, the last series has not received as much attention and Aherne feels she needs time off to recharge her batteries.

The Bush administration promises a future, new approach to global warming, but the violently anti-American reaction of the present moment is inescapable.\"</p> <p>On the narrow issue of the US-China confrontation, most papers back the President's firm stand. The <a href=\"http://nytimes.com\" target=\"_new\">New York Times</a>, for example, believes that Bush did the right thing: \"President Bush was right yesterday to register a strong protest of Beijing's failure to give American diplomats immediate access to the 24 crew members and to insist on the return of the plane and its crew as soon as possible. Encouragingly, the state department said it had received word that a meeting between the diplomats and the crew could come today.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com\" target=\"_new\">Chicago Sun-Times</a> also applauds Bush's tough talking in the standoff with China: \"On the issue of our downed plane, Bush, in his short term in office, has viewed China with eyes wide open. He has been careful when describing China to avoid using adjectives typically reserved for friends.</p> <p>\"In recent weeks, rhetoric has sharpened. Bush called out Beijing on China's assistance to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. The Chinese issued stern warnings about high-tech weapons sales to Taiwan. When 24 American crew members are being held, there is certainly an urgency to settle the matter. Still, Bush should stay with his practice of dealing with the Chinese firmly.\"</p> <p>In a thoughtful analysis in the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com\" target=\"_new\">Washington Post</a>, staff writer John Pomfret takes a more balanced view - and implicitly criticises Bush's hard line - as he tries to read the mindset of Chinese officials: \"China's ability to compromise on such incidents is limited in part by growing Chinese nationalism, which the Communist party has promoted as a replacement for communism as market-oriented reforms have made Marxist ideology seem more and more unreal.</p> <p>\"In addition, the cultural and ideological gaps between Beijing and Washington remain wide despite the exploding trade relationship, creating space for misunderstandings. For instance, many Chinese - civilians and officials - questioned the motivation of the US Pacific Command in releasing information about the collision hours after it occurred. One Chinese official said many of his colleagues would have preferred that the incident remain secret until it was resolved. 'Were you trying to make us lose face?' he asked, and he was not alone.\"</p> <p>On the more general issue of Bush's style of government, Joan Vennochi has an acid piece on the op-ed page of the <a href=\"http://boston.com/globe/glohome.htm\" target=\"_new\">Boston Globe</a>.</p> <p>She is scathing about the president's \"compassionate conservatism\", a campaign slogan which, she writes, he consistently refused to define: \"Today, the phrase that marketed a presidential candidate mocks more than it soothes. That is because, three months into this new administration, President Bush is promulgating policies that are definitely conservative and notably lacking in compassion. Most everything else he does is just for show. National polls show approval of Bush's job performance at nearly 60%. But public disapproval is edging up from the 20s to the 30s. It is not difficult to understand why the bloom is off the bush, at least a little.\"</p> <p><a href=\"MAIL TO:DBROWN445@AOL.COM\">dbrown445@aol.com</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,467917,00.html\">China blames US for aircraft incident</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,467787,00.html\">03.04.2001: China refuses to bow to Bush over spy plane</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,467803,00.html\">03.04.2001, Isabel Hilton: In the jaws of the dragon</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,467790,00.html\">03.04.2001, leader: Coming down to earth</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/story/0,7369,466898,00.html\">02.04.2001: Crash widens China rift</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/story/0,7369,465807,00.html\"> 28.3.2001: Bush's foreign policy forays</a></p> <p><b>Special report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/\">Special report: George Bush's America</a></p> <p><b>Graphic</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk/sys-images/Global/generated/graphical_text_blocks/2001/04/03/21038-986300589.gif\">How did a US plane collide with a Chinese jet?</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee80fe0\">Should Bush make China America's number one enemy?</a></p> <p><b>Audio report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0402gittings.ra\">02.04.2001: US-Chinese relations take a chilly turn (2mins 39)</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.chicago.tribune.com\" target=\"_new\">Chicago Tribune</a><br><a href=\"http://nytimes.com\" target=\"_new\">New York Times</a><br><a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com\" target=\"_new\">Chicago Sun-Times</a><br><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com\" target=\"_new\">Washington Post</a><br><a href=\"http://boston.com/globe/glohome.htm\" target=\"_new\">Boston Globe</a></p>",

The New York Times, for example, believes that Bush did the right thing: \"President Bush was right yesterday to register a strong protest of Beijing's failure to give American diplomats immediate access to the 24 crew members and to insist on the return of the plane and its crew as soon as possible. Encouragingly, the state department said it had received word that a meeting between the diplomats and the crew could come today.\" The Chicago Sun-Times also applauds Bush's tough talking in the standoff with China: \"On the issue of our downed plane, Bush, in his short term in office, has viewed China with eyes wide open. He has been careful when describing China to avoid using adjectives typically reserved for friends. \"In recent weeks, rhetoric has sharpened. Bush called out Beijing on China's assistance to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. The Chinese issued stern warnings about high-tech weapons sales to Taiwan. When 24 American crew members are being held, there is certainly an urgency to settle the matter. Still, Bush should stay with his practice of dealing with the Chinese firmly.\" In a thoughtful analysis in the Washington Post, staff writer John Pomfret takes a more balanced view - and implicitly criticises Bush's hard line - as he tries to read the mindset of Chinese officials: \"China's ability to compromise on such incidents is limited in part by growing Chinese nationalism, which the Communist party has promoted as a replacement for communism as market-oriented reforms have made Marxist ideology seem more and more unreal. \"In addition, the cultural and ideological gaps between Beijing and Washington remain wide despite the exploding trade relationship, creating space for misunderstandings. For instance, many Chinese - civilians and officials - questioned the motivation of the US Pacific Command in releasing information about the collision hours after it occurred. One Chinese official said many of his colleagues would have preferred that the incident remain secret until it was resolved. 'Were you trying to make us lose face?' he asked, and he was not alone.\" On the more general issue of Bush's style of government, Joan Vennochi has an acid piece on the op-ed page of the Boston Globe. She is scathing about the president's \"compassionate conservatism\", a campaign slogan which, she writes, he consistently refused to define: \"Today, the phrase that marketed a presidential candidate mocks more than it soothes. That is because, three months into this new administration, President Bush is promulgating policies that are definitely conservative and notably lacking in compassion. Most everything else he does is just for show. National polls show approval of Bush's job performance at nearly 60%. But public disapproval is edging up from the 20s to the 30s. It is not difficult to understand why the bloom is off the bush, at least a little.\" dbrown445@aol.com Related articles China blames US for aircraft incident 03.04.2001: China refuses to bow to Bush over spy plane 03.04.2001, Isabel Hilton: In the jaws of the dragon 03.04.2001, leader: Coming down to earth 02.04.2001: Crash widens China rift 28.3.2001: Bush's foreign policy forays Special report Special report: George Bush's America Graphic How did a US plane collide with a Chinese jet?

Mr Sherriff, 35, who is also marketing chief of the Sunday Times, has resigned and been put on three months' gardening leave. He said he did not have another job lined up, but wanted to move out of newspaper marketing in to another media arena. \"There have been a lot of changes at News International in the past year or so and, as I've been here for seven years, I am almost seen as the old guard,\" said Mr Sherriff. \"I've been at the front end of the newspaper wars and it's not going to change. Everyone is fighting for market share and managing decline.\" \"I want to move in to a new sector and I want more control over the product. After a yea-and-a-half as marketing director for the Times and Sunday Times I have learnt a lot about brand-building and can take my skills with me.\" Mr Sherriff has held talks with potential employees, but rules out following his predecessor Toby Constantine into the dot.com arena. Mr Sherriff decided to resign after spending 10 days crewing a Times-sponsored yacht in a round-the-world race. \"It was a very levelling experience and I just realised time is precious. I got back, walked in to Camilla's office and resigned,\" he said. Related story Apr 3: Times marketing chief quits",

The Ofsted report was based on inspections of 26 LEAs and interviews with more than 300 children in care, as well as visits to 120 primary and secondary schools, children's homes and secure units in England. It follows a damning report published by inspectors in Scotland last month, which found that looked-after children north of the border were being failed by the education system. Up to 75% of children in care leave school with no qualifications and last year the government admitted that the system failed too many of them. In March 1999, there were nearly 60,000 children up to the age of 18 in care, of whom three-quarters were 16 or under.

Mr Meacher, head of the government's rural task force, said: \"Unquestionably, there will be one this time, to ascertain the cause and how it happened, and the way we can prevent it happening again.</p> <p>\"We will want to know how the disease got such a hold and the levels of animal transport across the country.\"</p> <p>He said the future of farming, with more emphasis on organic production, small abattoirs and local production methods, would come under the spotlight. Mr Meacher, speaking at the launch of the Countryside Agency's third annual report, said that although farming in the UK accounted for only 1% of gross domestic product (GDP), farmers were responsible for caring for 70-80% of the landscape.</p> <p>He added that a longer-term view was needed \"about what we mean about sustainability in agriculture\".</p> <p>\"I think we have to accelerate this shift away from what is subsidised agriculture to agri-environment, on a much larger scale and roll out many of the measures that are in the rural white paper.</p> <p>\"We need a fundamental re-think of what we expect farming to produce.</p> <p>\"It will certainly be more localised, it will be less internationalised, less dependent on chemicals and fertilisers, it will be more low impact agriculture, more organic.</p> <p>\"We are at the outset of what has to be a widescale public debate.\"</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free

      "bodyText": "The government is to set up a wide-ranging public inquiry into the foot-and-mouth disease crisis, the environment minister, Michael Meacher, said today. It will investigate the reasons for the outbreak and look at a major shake-up in farming with more organic locally-produced meat and crops, he said. Public inquiries were set up after the 1967 foot-and-mouth outbreak and in 1952. Mr Meacher, head of the government's rural task force, said: \"Unquestionably, there will be one this time, to ascertain the cause and how it happened, and the way we can prevent it happening again. \"We will want to know how the disease got such a hold and the levels of animal transport across the country.\" He said the future of farming, with more emphasis on organic production, small abattoirs and local production methods, would come under the spotlight. Mr Meacher, speaking at the launch of the Countryside Agency's third annual report, said that although farming in the UK accounted for only 1% of gross domestic product (GDP), farmers were responsible for caring for 70-80% of the landscape. He added that a longer-term view was needed \"about what we mean about sustainability in agriculture\". \"I think we have to accelerate this shift away from what is subsidised agriculture to agri-environment, on a much larger scale and roll out many of the measures that are in the rural white paper. \"We need a fundamental re-think of what we expect farming to produce. \"It will certainly be more localised, it will be less internationalised, less dependent on chemicals and fertilisers, it will be more low impact agriculture, more organic. \"We are at the outset of what has to be a widescale public debate.\" Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up More on the election and foot and mouth Politics: foot and mouth What's going on?

It now stands at nearly 350,000 - over 10 times higher,\" Mr Hague said.</p> <p>\"At the current rate of slaughter, it would take 15 days to slaughter those animals that have already been authorised to be culled.\"</p> <p>Mr Hague's call came as it emerged that the carcasses of almost 900 cattle and sheep will have to be dug out of the ground after Maff realised that they had been buried in an \"unsuitable\" plot.</p> <p>The environment agency expressed fears the carcasses could pollute an underground spring that runs between two villages and supplies local farms.</p> <p>The rotting carcasses of the 650 sheep and 242 cattle -

      "bodyText": "A leading army officer today criticised suggestions that the military should be given a free rein to take charge of the foot and mouth crisis. The idea, put forward by the Tory leader, William Hague, was rejected by Brigadier Birtwhistle, one of the officers leading the army's response to foot and mouth, who said he would not like to take the lead. Mr Hague said that the Ministry of Agriculture (Maff) was now badly over-stretched and should relinquish control. Speaking on a visit to Usk, Monmouthshire, the prime minister, Tony Blair, said there was no constraint on the army's role but added that they may be reluctant to take on some of the tasks. He stressed that a joint effort between the military and Maff was needed to bring the disease under control. The Conservatives have repeatedly used the low level of army involvement in dealing with the crisis as a means to attack the government. \"When we called for the army to be brought in, the slaughter backlog was just over 30,000 animals. It now stands at nearly 350,000 - over 10 times higher,\" Mr Hague said. \"At the current rate of slaughter, it would take 15 days to slaughter those animals that have already been authorised to be culled.\" Mr Hague's call came as it emerged that the carcasses of almost 900 cattle and sheep will have to be dug out of the ground after Maff realised that they had been buried in an \"unsuitable\" plot. The environment agency expressed fears the carcasses could pollute an underground spring that runs between two villages and supplies local farms. The rotting carcasses of the 650 sheep and 242 cattle - buried more than two weeks ago after foot and mouth reached Low Houselope Farm, near Tow Law, County Durham - will be dug up and buried elsewhere. The exhumation is expected to begin on Friday An environment agency spokeswoman said: \"We advised this site was not suitable but for whatever reason that advice was not followed.\" A mass burial site for tens of thousands of animals that have already been slaughtered is due to open today. The graveyard at Throckmorton airfield, near Pershore in Worcestershire, will be of a similar size to the one currently in use at Great Orton, Cumbria. There are 943 confirmed cases of foot and mouth in the UK, the latest Maff figures show. However, there are some signs the outbreak could be tailing off. A fresh analysis by scientists at Imperial College, London, is expected to offer a revised - and lower - forecast of the number of cases anticipated by June, which was estimated at more than 4,000 earlier this month.

      "bodyText": "The news that Labour and the Conservatives have been trying frantically to cancel their poster campaigns to avoid losing hundreds of thousands of pounds must have put a smile on the face of Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. His party's cash-strapped status means it has little money to spend on pre-election advertising and no poster bookings to worry about. Labour and the Tories booked heavyweight poster campaigns for this month in anticipation of a May 3 election, and both face charges of up to 90% of the cost of the bookings if they cancel at the last minute. This means the electorate faces the bizarre prospect of a major publicity blitz two months ahead of the planned election, followed by a resounding silence in the run-up to polling day. This is partly because a \u00a314m cap on campaign spending will restrict the two parties from booking further campaigns and partly because a boom in the poster industry means there is little spare capacity left in May. The dilemma has led some in both parties to think the unthinkable - do they really need to bother advertising at all? The evidence against the power of political advertising is pretty overwhelming. In 1997, the Conservative party spent almost twice as much as Labour on its pre-election campaigns, only to suffer its worst defeat for decades. And a recent survey conducted by the Chartered Institute of Marketing concluded political advertising had virtually no effect on the way people vote. The report found the vast majority of voters were completely uninfluenced by political adverts. And negative political campaigns such as the Tories' infamous 1997 \"demon eyes\" posters can voters into the arms of the opposition. Labour's huge lead in the opinion polls has already led some Conservatives to question the wisdom of spending millions of pounds of the already cash-strapped party's funds on advertising when the result of the election is pretty much a foregone conclusion. For Labour, the problem is more complicated. The party's biggest problem this time around is voter apathy, something that will not be helped by a drawn-out campaign and a bored electorate. The more the media talks about Labour having it in the bag, the more likely the voters are to stay at home. And while political advertising is unlikely to change anyone's vote, it could be used to scare Labour supporters into turning out on polling day.

Mr Putin punctuated the rest of his speech with calls for efficiency, transparency and clarity in state policy and reforms in medical care, education and pensions that could increase citizens' confidence in the government. He said his government had achieved its goal of strengthening the federal centre's control over all levels of government. However, he lamented that other goals remained out of reach. The standard of living in Russia remains \"extremely low\", he cautioned, and investment is strangled by state interference. \"Russian entrepreneurs continue to invest in the country's economy with caution\", while bureaucrats \"continue to put pressure on business, squeezing business initiative and activity\", he told members of Russia's political elite gathered in the Kremlin's Marble Hall. Mr Putin made a plea for structural reforms in the economy, warning that without them the nation could sink into stagnation. He said that instead of developing its manufacturing base, the country was becoming even more dependent on exports of raw materials, and too much wealth was being accrued through the redistribution of state resources rather than production. \"This is a road to economic and social stagnation,\" Mr Putin said. \"This can be avoided if the efforts to achieve structural transformations don't end simply with the writing of concepts and programs.\" His hour-long speech was filled with proposals on further strengthening the government, but it was lacking in specifics on how economic reform could be realised. In the foreign affairs sphere, Putin called for Russia to cultivate its ties with Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose grouping of former Soviet republics. He reiterated that Russia's economic interests should help dictate foreign policy, and that the Nato alliance had no right to usurp the right of the UN security council to sanction force or the threat of force to resolve conflicts. Mr Putin has been 15 months in office - first as acting president, after Boris Yeltsin's unexpected resignation in December 1999, then after winning the election last March. During his time in power, he has concentrated on regaining the Kremlin's firm political grip on all levels of government and trimming back the extensive powers of regional leaders. Last week, he further strengthened his hand with changes to the cabinet that landed his loyalists in the key positions of defence and interior minister. They are charged with pushing through reforms in the armed forces and police. Mr Putin has advocated market-oriented reforms, overhauled the labyrinthine tax system and put liberal economists in top advisory posts, but real economic reform has lagged.

At the end of January the committee heard from experts that British universities would be forced to charge top- up fees to enable them to pay realistic salaries. This was to avert a \"swinging 60s timebomb\", predicted to explode when the generation of academics trained in the 1960s retire in a few years. </p> <p>But the committee has also heard that students are dropping out of higher education because they cannot pay tuition fees.

From next September Princeton says it will replace student loans with scholarships, to enable all its eligible undergraduate students to obtain their education without incurring thousands of dollars of debt. There will also be more financial aid for graduate students. </p> <p>This generosity will cost Princeton around $11m next year. The money will come from the interest on Princeton's endowment income, which now stands at about $8bn. In the British debate about fees, the use of endowment income has not figured very largely, though the Conservatives are de bating whether to back the idea of a one-off endowment \"starter\" to replace the teaching block grant. In the US, by contrast, the tax regime encourages the raising of endowments and the philanthropic activities of those who fund them. Philanthropy magazine has reported Harvard University's endowment to be around $19.2bn, more than the annual budgets of 140 nation states.

The polytechnics were not permitted to retain financial surpluses, while the unspoken conditions attached to state aid to the pre-1992 universities suppressed any desire on their part to increase endowment activity.

      "body": "<p>Helen Aspell, the treasurer of the National Union of Students, was punched on her way home to the hotel in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Her attacker was a badge-wearing delegate from the NUS's own conference in Blackpool, an elected representative of university students. </p> <p>Worse still, the attacker's motive is clear. It wasn't alcohol. Proud not to be in the closet, Aspell made no secret of her sexuality and campaigned to be NUS president with the firm backing of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual liberation movements. </p> <p>In an incredible scene on the conference floor, she denounced her attacker to 1,000 delegates, knowing that he was almost certainly among them: \"What you had was a woman at 1.40 this morning who was walking home, and someone came up and stopped me. This person called me a 'queer fucking bitch' and hit me. </p> <p>\"Delegate, you did not have the brains to take your delegate badge off, you ran away. You didn't have the guts to face what you'd done. You probably think it's OK to hit any LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual or transsexual] member, but you are not welcome in this national union. I'm not going to run away.\" </p> <p>The attack was not an isolated incident. Since her speech, there have been rumours of several students suffering similar incidents after a week in which disabilities, gender, religion and sexuality were all verbally attacked in student election campaigns and meetings. Some delegates were reduced to tears. Aspell says the union cannot pass this off as an attack by a fringe malcontent: something has gone wrong in this year's conference, and a run of events led to her being targeted: \"This homophobia has been stoked up throughout this conference. Those of you at presidential hustings who were shouting abuse that night, you may not have been responsible for my attack, but the homophobia you whipped up was responsible for the attack on me.\" </p> <p>That homophobia and sexism should strike in Britain's most progressive union was a shock to the NUS. The union represents ethnic minority communities in larger numbers than most British institutions, women make up more than half the executive platform and LGBT members are keynote speakers in every debate. </p> <p>Off the conference floor, Aspell thinks that at the heart of the attack on her is something even more dangerous than right-wing views in NUS. </p> <p>\"There are a certain number of delegates who think it's funny to subject women to a storm of sexist abuse at this conference,\" she says. \"But this comes out of a society where politicians from all parties have been using racist language, particularly in the asylum debate, making it sound like intolerance is acceptable.\" </p> <p>Despite having been through a week of political rancour and infighting, the threat of homophobia united the conference in a standing ovation. </p> <p>\"The NUS cannot just be about voting in policies,\" said the re-elected president, Owain James. \"We have to take equality throughout the movement and into wider society. We have to realise what happens when we let people say these things in conference - it only takes one person. I want to send out a clear message to students that this is not tolerable.\" </p> <p>In the last ten minutes of the conference, Beth Aze, NUS LGB (Lesbian and Gay Branch) officer, took the stage with every out and proud delegate to say, \"All the last two days we've been called dikes and the harassment has continued. This is the most dangerous, sexist environment I have ever known. Kind words and applause are not enough. Helen is not a victim, she is a survivor.\" </p> <p>This sort of sentiment could be bubbling away most years. According to the previous president Andrew Pakes: \"There's a myth that students are overwhelmingly progressive. I don't think they necessarily are, but this does sound like the worst I have seen in a long long time.\" </p> <p>Although the far-right threat united students, the week before that there was an intense political in-fight. And some delegates complained that speakers were too quick to begin using Aspell's experience for political capital, saying \"we will not tolerate homophobia\" simply to get a cheer. </p> <p>In student politics, the stakes are both low and high: you can count significant press stories about the NUS on one hand, but parliamentary benches are stuffed with former executives. And student groups certainly take it seriously. </p> <p>This is the last year that the NUS conference will be held in a hall that looks like a derelict airport lounge on the west side of Blackpool - rumour has it that it will become a casino. Underneath piped medleys ranging from trad jazz to movie classics, groups of Socialist Workers spent the last week bellowing: \"The students, united, will never be divided.\" When they tried to take that on to the conference floor, the chair said, \"I'm sure you won't be, dears. But can you keep it down?\" </p> <p>The screaming and the shouting, the stamping and the clapping are only the peak of the electioneering that takes place at the conference. \"The organised end of student politics is Labour and those that call themselves independent, but who are connected to Labour,\" said Toby Rumford, president of Sussex University's student union. \"They know how to get people to vote, how to use conference procedure, which unfortunately I don't think the further left groups do.\" </p> <p>Ben Monks, re-elected national secretary on Tuesday and a leading light in Labour Students, agreed: \"I wish there was some kind of gulag of Labour students. It would make life a lot easier. But our success really just reflects that we are a real organisation that represents our members.\" </p> <p>And it is not entirely one-sided: a far-left student politician and dedicated race and further-education campaigner, Sandrea Morgan was elected vice-president for further-education and union development by a narrow margin on Tuesday. Her victory was a fillip for the left, who lost every other full-time election post. </p> <p>A student from Southgate College in north London, Sandrea's main opponent was a Warwick University student, Nicholle Lennon, who was on the NUS national executive. Most delegates put Lennon's failure down to her running for a post looking after further education when she is a higher-education student. </p> <p>The NUS's failure to represent further education colleges was central to this year's conference. Late on Wednesday night, further education students stormed the conference hall, screaming: \"We've been fucked over.\" </p> <p>Alleging that students had not been allowed to ask questions and that too little time had been given for debate in the evening's separate FE session, the protesters demanded more time be given to their concerns. </p> <p>Katherine Foster, from Worthing Sixth Form College, said, \"What just happened in there is why people don't send delegates. We had two minutes. We couldn't get through our motion, it was just destroyed.\" And in the last minutes of the conference delegates rejected a proposal to allow only FE delegates to vote for the FE post. </p> <p>The machinations and old-style politics depress, or even disgust, most delegates. Organisers on balconies indicating to their flock how to vote and when to clap, filibustering and group deals are not why most students go into politics. </p> <p>\"We come here to represent people more than for NUS politics,\" said first-time delegate Matt Hood, a Cambridge University student. \"But here you don't get educated debate. It's not a conference: it's a political game where people push and shove. They try to gather up enough pawns from around the country to win. </p> <p>\"People putting forward motions waived their right to speak to members of the national executive almost as the norm, to help them get elected. We have to think whether we should be talking about elections at the same time as setting policy,\" he added. </p> <p>But newly-elected vice-president education Brooks Duke says the conference procedure has value -if only of an anthropological kind. \"People can't experience what happens at NUS anywhere else. Other unions have abandoned confrontational politics in their conferences. It is fun.\" </p> <p>Outside of the hall, a mournful pack of campaigners on issues from health to Cuba felt their causes were falling to student apathy this year. Husam Zomlot, president of the General Union of Palestinian Students, said: \"Last year it was more active: students were much more interested in more things, more involved with other issues. Now they just come and elect people.\" </p> <p>Jim Gledhill, from the Cuba Solidarity Campaign did not think it was as bad as all that, saying he'd signed up new members and had a lot of interest. But the conference concentrated on issues directly affecting most students much more than last year. </p> <p>Yet within the confusion, and disenchantment, the NUS set its policy for next year, a policy it hopes it can take to the centre of the national election. The union is campaigning for an inquiry into education funding and for a means-tested grant. It has given greater representation to black students and begun to tackle, or at least talk about, the under-representation of further education.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Rosie is small, slight and very pretty. She looks even younger than 25 years old; it's hard to believe that she has four sons, aged seven, six, four and 19 months. She left school when she was 11; she was, she says, truanting, or bunking, all the time. Now she's back at college studying for City and Guilds certificates in maths and English, though it's a struggle given how little free time she has. She wants her children to do better at school than she did. </p> <p>Vicky, who is 20, has a daughter of three. She officially left school a week before her 16th birthday, but in fact she missed the whole of her fifth year. She was put in a class for badly-behaved children, though she'd been diagnosed as dyslexic, and the experience was too much for her, so she simply didn't go to school. Vicky believes her daughter is already shaping up to be \"brainier\" than she was; and wants to help her achieve. </p> <p>Kelly is 21, and has three children under the age of four. She hated school and left at the age of 14. She says she was always bullied and her education suffered; it's embarrassing, she says, that she can't spell well enough to fill in forms. She wants her children to be \"really good\" at school. </p> <p>All three of them have been helped by a special course run by Ferries and Port Sunlight Family Groups on the Wirral as part of its parenting classes programme. The Successful Learning pilot scheme aims to break down parents' barriers to learning, because these in turn undermine their own children's potential to do well at school. If parents lack basic skills themselves, they can feel humiliated and confused and unable to help their children. And if they have felt let down by their teachers, they pass that on. It is, says Jean Robb of Successful Learning, a vicious circle. \"If parents have had a disruptive attitude in school, those belligerent attitudes are carried over when they have to deal with their children's teachers,\" she says. </p> <p>It's important to explain to parents, says Jean, that if they don't play their role in a supportive way so that teachers and students can play theirs in turn, then disorder is the result. \"Then everyone feels confused, disappointed, irritated and exhausted,\" she says. Many of the parents that Jean has been working with left school with very negative views of education. \"They'd been getting into trouble, they'd been told they were thick, they felt it wasn't worth going,\" says Elaine Banks of the Ferries and Port Sunlight Family Groups. \"We want to break that cycle, give them the confidence to keep going and help their own children.\" </p> <p>The effectiveness of the Successful Learning course, she says, is striking. Each of the nine smaller groups within the Family Groups has had four two-hour sessions with Jean and her colleague Hilary Letts. \"It has been wonderful to see how they have blossomed,\" says Elaine Banks. \"One mother who had always struggled with spelling was standing up in front of the class spelling a 13-letter word forwards and backwards.\" She is referring to Kelly, who says of her achievement: \"I just couldn't believe it; I went around smiling all day.\" </p> <p>So how is it done? The emphasis of Jean and Hilary's work is on learning how to learn; on breaking tasks down into manageable smaller tasks, then building them back up. One morning last week in a church hall in New Ferry, seven mothers had begun their session by making up a couple of child's jigsaws, one showing a country farm and one showing a city park. Easy enough to do; but, guided by Jean and Hilary, they were then using the completed jigsaws to illustrate all kinds of classroom lessons. Hilary asked them to find similarities and differences between the two pictures. \"This is something children have to do all through school,\" she explained. \"They might have to compare life as a Roman with life as a Greek, for example.\" </p> <p>The women began by making a list of things that were the same in each picture, then by making a list of things that were different. Then Jean asked them to describe the similarities more fully, using prepositions such as \"beside\" or \"under\". \"Lots of children can't write down their ideas because they don't understand about prepositions,\" she said. \"But once they can do that, they're away.\" </p> <p>It was a lively class, with plenty of humour; within a few minutes adjectives and relationships between people had been added to the mix. \"The black and white dog is pulling the boy over the grass, across the path, and into the pond,\" said Karen, one of the mums, triumphantly. \"Do you see how it's not difficult, you don't need a huge vocabulary?\" asked Jean. \"Once you can describe something relative to something else, you've got a full and rich use of language. So if you're looking at a picture book or a jigsaw with your child, get them to describe it, write it down.\" </p> <p>Next came maths. Beginning by simply counting different objects in the jigsaw pictures led on quite naturally to drawing graphs and algebra. </p> <p>\"Making a mistake doesn't matter,\" encouraged Jean. \"You know when you were at school and the teacher said 'That's wrong' and you then think 'She hates me. I hate her too.'?\" There were nods of recognition all round the room. </p> <p>\"Saying something is wrong isn't personal. The teacher can help you get it right.\" </p> <p> The class by now was adding 2A to B as if they'd been doing it all their lives. They are enthusiastic about the methods they are using and keen to take them home. \"I'm not very good at maths,\" said Karen, 35. She has two daughters, Siobhan, aged eight and Latoya who is just two, and who had spent the morning in the free creche that is attached to all the Ferries and Port Sunlight Families Group training courses. \"School was more about fun for me and I left at 15. Now I can help my older daughter with her homework; when I was at school my parents couldn't help me. I want better for my daughters than it was for me.\" </p> <p>It's funny, says Becky, who's 22, how much she hated school at the time; now, she says, she'd go back like a shot. She's studying for her City and Guilds numeracy and English exams.

      "bodyText": "Rosie is small, slight and very pretty. She looks even younger than 25 years old; it's hard to believe that she has four sons, aged seven, six, four and 19 months. She left school when she was 11; she was, she says, truanting, or bunking, all the time. Now she's back at college studying for City and Guilds certificates in maths and English, though it's a struggle given how little free time she has. She wants her children to do better at school than she did. Vicky, who is 20, has a daughter of three. She officially left school a week before her 16th birthday, but in fact she missed the whole of her fifth year. She was put in a class for badly-behaved children, though she'd been diagnosed as dyslexic, and the experience was too much for her, so she simply didn't go to school. Vicky believes her daughter is already shaping up to be \"brainier\" than she was; and wants to help her achieve. Kelly is 21, and has three children under the age of four. She hated school and left at the age of 14. She says she was always bullied and her education suffered; it's embarrassing, she says, that she can't spell well enough to fill in forms. She wants her children to be \"really good\" at school. All three of them have been helped by a special course run by Ferries and Port Sunlight Family Groups on the Wirral as part of its parenting classes programme. The Successful Learning pilot scheme aims to break down parents' barriers to learning, because these in turn undermine their own children's potential to do well at school. If parents lack basic skills themselves, they can feel humiliated and confused and unable to help their children. And if they have felt let down by their teachers, they pass that on. It is, says Jean Robb of Successful Learning, a vicious circle. \"If parents have had a disruptive attitude in school, those belligerent attitudes are carried over when they have to deal with their children's teachers,\" she says. It's important to explain to parents, says Jean, that if they don't play their role in a supportive way so that teachers and students can play theirs in turn, then disorder is the result. \"Then everyone feels confused, disappointed, irritated and exhausted,\" she says. Many of the parents that Jean has been working with left school with very negative views of education. \"They'd been getting into trouble, they'd been told they were thick, they felt it wasn't worth going,\" says Elaine Banks of the Ferries and Port Sunlight Family Groups. \"We want to break that cycle, give them the confidence to keep going and help their own children.\" The effectiveness of the Successful Learning course, she says, is striking. Each of the nine smaller groups within the Family Groups has had four two-hour sessions with Jean and her colleague Hilary Letts. \"It has been wonderful to see how they have blossomed,\" says Elaine Banks. \"One mother who had always struggled with spelling was standing up in front of the class spelling a 13-letter word forwards and backwards.\" She is referring to Kelly, who says of her achievement: \"I just couldn't believe it; I went around smiling all day.\" So how is it done? The emphasis of Jean and Hilary's work is on learning how to learn; on breaking tasks down into manageable smaller tasks, then building them back up. One morning last week in a church hall in New Ferry, seven mothers had begun their session by making up a couple of child's jigsaws, one showing a country farm and one showing a city park. Easy enough to do; but, guided by Jean and Hilary, they were then using the completed jigsaws to illustrate all kinds of classroom lessons. Hilary asked them to find similarities and differences between the two pictures. \"This is something children have to do all through school,\" she explained. \"They might have to compare life as a Roman with life as a Greek, for example.\" The women began by making a list of things that were the same in each picture, then by making a list of things that were different. Then Jean asked them to describe the similarities more fully, using prepositions such as \"beside\" or \"under\". \"Lots of children can't write down their ideas because they don't understand about prepositions,\" she said. \"But once they can do that, they're away.\" It was a lively class, with plenty of humour; within a few minutes adjectives and relationships between people had been added to the mix. \"The black and white dog is pulling the boy over the grass, across the path, and into the pond,\" said Karen, one of the mums, triumphantly. \"Do you see how it's not difficult, you don't need a huge vocabulary?\" asked Jean. \"Once you can describe something relative to something else, you've got a full and rich use of language. So if you're looking at a picture book or a jigsaw with your child, get them to describe it, write it down.\" Next came maths. Beginning by simply counting different objects in the jigsaw pictures led on quite naturally to drawing graphs and algebra. \"Making a mistake doesn't matter,\" encouraged Jean. \"You know when you were at school and the teacher said 'That's wrong' and you then think 'She hates me. I hate her too.'?\" There were nods of recognition all round the room. \"Saying something is wrong isn't personal. The teacher can help you get it right.\" The class by now was adding 2A to B as if they'd been doing it all their lives. They are enthusiastic about the methods they are using and keen to take them home. \"I'm not very good at maths,\" said Karen, 35. She has two daughters, Siobhan, aged eight and Latoya who is just two, and who had spent the morning in the free creche that is attached to all the Ferries and Port Sunlight Families Group training courses. \"School was more about fun for me and I left at 15. Now I can help my older daughter with her homework; when I was at school my parents couldn't help me. I want better for my daughters than it was for me.\" It's funny, says Becky, who's 22, how much she hated school at the time; now, she says, she'd go back like a shot. She's studying for her City and Guilds numeracy and English exams. In the meantime, she's using the techniques she's learned with Jean and Hilary with her son, who's nearly five. \"He just wasn't interested in anything, you'd do a jigsaw or something and it would last five minutes, but now I've learned ways to do things with him, little games to make him interested in learning numbers and colours.\" Because Jean and Hilary's approach depends entirely on what's required by the parents, their classes cover a wide range of different needs; there is no set curriculum and they are able to be very flexible.

      "bodyText": "Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has taken steps to ensure his television career doesn't go stale overnight. He has set up his own production company with Pearson Television that will guarantee a financial income above and beyond his fees for appearing on TV shows. Oliver will use the new company, Fresh Productions, to develop non-cookery shows. Executives say this could lead to Oliver hosting gameshows or entertainment shows. \"I think everyone recognises that Jamie is not just a good chef - he has oodles of charisma and charm and that's what makes him appealing to viewers,\" said a spokeswoman for Pearson. Last year Oliver held talks with Channel 4 about a possible new show to replace Chris Evans's TFI Friday. But he is also exploring the possibility of developing shows that involve other presenters. And it could be the recipe for long-term success - sources at Pearson say Oliver is acutely aware that TV stars' careers can often be extended by a sensible rationing of appearances. At the moment he not only appears in hit BBC2 cookery show Naked Chef, but he also stars in a high-profile advertising campaign for Sainsbury's as part of a \u00a32m deal he clinched last year. Anthea Turner, for instanc,e has seen her career flop after she saturated the screens with her presence. Similarly Carol Vorderman has attracted criticism after she agreed to do what many saw as too many shows for ITV. Oliver, whose catchphrase is \"pukka\", made his name as the infectiously enthusiastic Essex star of the BBC2 series. He is currently filming his last series of Naked Chef and his contract with the BBC ends this year. Oliver will own 75% of the new company, guaranteeing a major stake in any commercial spin-offs from his career. Pearson said the company would be developing \"original, cutting-edge, high quality programming\" across the world. \"I am absolutely over the moon and very excited, this is a great opportunity for me to be really creative and explore TV cookery. I can't wait to get started,\" said Oliver. \"I'm delighted Jamie has chosen Pearson Television to be his partner and we are looking forward to working with him on a wide variety of programming,\" said Alan Boyd, chief executive of UK productions at Pearson.",

      "body": "<p>September 1999: I'm on a trading floor, talking down a phone, selling derivatives to an obstinate American client. I'm earning six figures a year, and I'm utterly miserable. Fast-forward a year. A different office. I'm still talking down a phone, but now I'm working for a homelessness charity. I'm earning nothing and I've never been happier. How the hell did that happen? </p> <p>After eight years in the Square Mile, my life in the fast lane had run out of gas. I no longer cared about the markets or my clients, and wasn't even bothered about my bonus. I snoozed in front of my screens, waking to find dribble on my desk. I was moody and moany, vacantly sullen, a fun guy to be with. </p> <p>Having hated my job for a year, my performance was pretty poor. I told myself that it was just temporary, but in my heart I knew my career was comatose. Yet how could I leave? What else could I possibly do? The markets provided few skills transferable to the real world, and nothing else paid nearly as well. It took a friend to open my eyes. On discovering the ruddy-faced health of my bank balances, she pointed out that I could afford to leave the next day: the only thing stopping me was myself. </p> <p>Only then did I begin to consider life outside the City. Over the next six months I applied for a few jobs, but my lack of conviction was transparent, and rewarded accordingly. I didn't know what I wanted to do; I only knew what I didn't. More months passed with me stuck in my silken rut until another friend got drunk to the point of truthfulness and, exasperated, snapped that I should \"go and work for a charity or something\". </p> <p>Immediately everything became obvious. I decided to take some time off and volunteer for a charity. If I guaranteed them six months, I reasoned, I would surely find an interesting, challenging job that would account for my time away from paid employment. Meanwhile I could rethink my options and look for a new career. Everyone would be a winner. All I had to do was find the charity. </p> <p>This proved to be the tricky part. There are a lot of voluntary organisations out there. With ignorant simplicity I discarded entire sectors and ultimately decided on 12, ranging from overseas aid to homelessness. I updated my CV, wrote some letters and sat back for the flood of replies. </p> <p>It was a long wait. After a month of silence I was getting discouraged. This was compounded by the few replies that tiptoed back. One said they were very keen and would be in touch. I never heard from them again. Another said they had no need for me, a third had envelopes to be stuffed. </p> <p>Finally I began to get some interest and arranged surreptitious meetings: with bonus time approaching, I didn't want anyone to know my plans. But the suggested jobs - databases, media monitoring - were useful rather than interesting. Not unreasonably, several people wanted me to twist some City arms into stumping up serious money. Yet the last thing I wanted was to turn up with a begging bowl and a big smile, trying to tap my former friends. </p> <p>After three months my plan was wobbling badly. The organisations I was talking to seemed to be in a state of chaos, or unable to think beyond the narrowest boundaries. Almost every one had failed to reply, lost my details, didn't want me or needed me only as unskilled office-fodder. Only a lucky break saved the situation. A friend of a friend suggested her old employer, a campaigning charity working with homeless people. It had been on my original list of 12. I had written to them twice but received no reply. She suggested I try again, and gave me a name. </p> <p>This short cut made progress delightfully swift. Within days I had met my new contact. She seemed enthusiastic and quickly came back with a proposal. As a history graduate with eight years of trading interest rates, I understood little of her spiel on green papers, but understood that she wanted me to research smart schemes that prevented or alleviated homelessness. Anything valuable would be used in their response to this green paper thingie, and so might actually achieve something, she said. After years mentally treading water, I liked the idea of learning something new, even housing policy. I was eager to start - as soon as my bonus was banked. </p> <p>In February 2000, four months after I began my search, I left the City. My colleagues confided over drunken celebrations that they had thought I'd never really do it, and how they'd considered doing the same but \"didn't have the nerve\". Yet as a single person, with only a small mortgage and bonuses stashed away, I was in a unique position. And only I knew how desperate I was to leave. </p> <p>Unusually muted and nervous, I found my first weeks endlessly surprising. Accustomed to the buzz of a trading floor, this new environment was disturbingly quiet. I could hear the tapping of keyboards and conversations on the phone. Even these were different: people spoke in whole sentences, without the \"yeah, yeah, right, right, offer this, bid that, done\" tempo I knew so well. As for the people, I was expecting a collection of meek do-gooders, but I was surprised to find genuine friendliness, with my previous career attracting only curiosity mixed with sympathy. </p> <p>The biggest surprise, however, was me. Arriving for a six-month stint, steeped in City cynicism, I never expected to enjoy it so much. The office was basic and the computers prehistoric, but I loved it. With the tedious zeal typical of converts, I had found a home and had a new subject to bore friends with. It helped that I enjoyed the project, that the office hummed with purpose and every day brought something new. And I liked the people, even when I forgot I was no longer on a trading floor and they had to tell me to stop shouting. </p> <p>It took five months to complete my project.

      "bodyText": "September 1999: I'm on a trading floor, talking down a phone, selling derivatives to an obstinate American client. I'm earning six figures a year, and I'm utterly miserable. Fast-forward a year. A different office. I'm still talking down a phone, but now I'm working for a homelessness charity. I'm earning nothing and I've never been happier. How the hell did that happen? After eight years in the Square Mile, my life in the fast lane had run out of gas. I no longer cared about the markets or my clients, and wasn't even bothered about my bonus. I snoozed in front of my screens, waking to find dribble on my desk. I was moody and moany, vacantly sullen, a fun guy to be with. Having hated my job for a year, my performance was pretty poor. I told myself that it was just temporary, but in my heart I knew my career was comatose. Yet how could I leave? What else could I possibly do? The markets provided few skills transferable to the real world, and nothing else paid nearly as well. It took a friend to open my eyes. On discovering the ruddy-faced health of my bank balances, she pointed out that I could afford to leave the next day: the only thing stopping me was myself. Only then did I begin to consider life outside the City. Over the next six months I applied for a few jobs, but my lack of conviction was transparent, and rewarded accordingly. I didn't know what I wanted to do; I only knew what I didn't. More months passed with me stuck in my silken rut until another friend got drunk to the point of truthfulness and, exasperated, snapped that I should \"go and work for a charity or something\". Immediately everything became obvious. I decided to take some time off and volunteer for a charity. If I guaranteed them six months, I reasoned, I would surely find an interesting, challenging job that would account for my time away from paid employment. Meanwhile I could rethink my options and look for a new career. Everyone would be a winner. All I had to do was find the charity. This proved to be the tricky part. There are a lot of voluntary organisations out there. With ignorant simplicity I discarded entire sectors and ultimately decided on 12, ranging from overseas aid to homelessness. I updated my CV, wrote some letters and sat back for the flood of replies. It was a long wait. After a month of silence I was getting discouraged. This was compounded by the few replies that tiptoed back. One said they were very keen and would be in touch. I never heard from them again. Another said they had no need for me, a third had envelopes to be stuffed. Finally I began to get some interest and arranged surreptitious meetings: with bonus time approaching, I didn't want anyone to know my plans. But the suggested jobs - databases, media monitoring - were useful rather than interesting. Not unreasonably, several people wanted me to twist some City arms into stumping up serious money. Yet the last thing I wanted was to turn up with a begging bowl and a big smile, trying to tap my former friends. After three months my plan was wobbling badly. The organisations I was talking to seemed to be in a state of chaos, or unable to think beyond the narrowest boundaries. Almost every one had failed to reply, lost my details, didn't want me or needed me only as unskilled office-fodder. Only a lucky break saved the situation. A friend of a friend suggested her old employer, a campaigning charity working with homeless people. It had been on my original list of 12. I had written to them twice but received no reply. She suggested I try again, and gave me a name. This short cut made progress delightfully swift. Within days I had met my new contact. She seemed enthusiastic and quickly came back with a proposal. As a history graduate with eight years of trading interest rates, I understood little of her spiel on green papers, but understood that she wanted me to research smart schemes that prevented or alleviated homelessness. Anything valuable would be used in their response to this green paper thingie, and so might actually achieve something, she said. After years mentally treading water, I liked the idea of learning something new, even housing policy. I was eager to start - as soon as my bonus was banked. In February 2000, four months after I began my search, I left the City. My colleagues confided over drunken celebrations that they had thought I'd never really do it, and how they'd considered doing the same but \"didn't have the nerve\". Yet as a single person, with only a small mortgage and bonuses stashed away, I was in a unique position. And only I knew how desperate I was to leave. Unusually muted and nervous, I found my first weeks endlessly surprising. Accustomed to the buzz of a trading floor, this new environment was disturbingly quiet. I could hear the tapping of keyboards and conversations on the phone. Even these were different: people spoke in whole sentences, without the \"yeah, yeah, right, right, offer this, bid that, done\" tempo I knew so well. As for the people, I was expecting a collection of meek do-gooders, but I was surprised to find genuine friendliness, with my previous career attracting only curiosity mixed with sympathy. The biggest surprise, however, was me. Arriving for a six-month stint, steeped in City cynicism, I never expected to enjoy it so much. The office was basic and the computers prehistoric, but I loved it. With the tedious zeal typical of converts, I had found a home and had a new subject to bore friends with. It helped that I enjoyed the project, that the office hummed with purpose and every day brought something new. And I liked the people, even when I forgot I was no longer on a trading floor and they had to tell me to stop shouting. It took five months to complete my project. That done, I had no desire to leave and volunteered for another couple of months, writing bits and pieces, even stuffing envelopes. Just as I was planning to go and earn some money, I was asked to stay and temp in the press office. By September I was earning much less and working much harder than ever before, but according to everyone who knew me well, I was \"a new man\". This was an eye-opener, coming from an environment where your worth was your bonus. It was novel to be working 14-hour days without complaint for what I once regarded as a pittance. It was amusing to see the faces of former colleagues, who assumed I was massaging my conscience, when I told them - truthfully - that I had never worked harder. I don't think the City is an easy life. There are too many egos, too much bullshit, for it ever to be a breeze. Equally, it's not that tough; it just wasn't right for me.

All the rest is heavy with dissembling: by him, by his political opponents, by us in the media, by everyone in the tight little community of political activism. This is pretty insulting to everyone outside it.</p> <p>Here are six truths that strike this observer: six things that will happen over the next two months which deserve to be more roundly understood.</p> <p>1) There will be a general election on June 7. Not a shred of doubt about it. The general election is what the decision was about, and it is not admirable that Mr Blair should fail to say so. The only political importance of the county elections is that they should not be held before the general election, because the Conservatives may do quite well in them and capture some fugitive momentum. The two must therefore be held on the same day, and the day is now specified. Besides that, the national arguments against waiting until the autumn are axiomatic.</p> <p>Mr Blair made those arguments yesterday. Delaying elections indefinitely, he said, would be bad for certainty in government, bad for the image of Britain abroad, bad in every way. But a false decorum prevented him from drawing the only available conclusion, and telling the nation in an adult way that he will seek a new mandate in 10 weeks' time.</p> <p>If this has a rationale, it lies in tired old political game- playing, to \"wrong-foot\" the opposition. Although William Hague often seems like a man with a big mouth and two right feet, even he is unlikely to fall over them here by running in the wrong direction.</p> <p>2) Foot and mouth will have ceased to be a major concern for the public before the end of this month. It will still be prevalent in certain counties, but the diagnosis/ slaughter ratio will be close to one-to-one, as military efficiency comes to the aid of political reputation.</p> <p>It is conceivable that there will be a horrible outbreak in some new place, which is the second unmentioned reason for not publicly committing to June 7. In fact this could never be big enough, given the controls now in place, to make an election either impossible or inadvisable.</p> <p>Besides, the perception of all this will begin to change. The epidemic will acquire a truer perspective. The fact that it affects only 1% of livestock farmers will displace the perception that it is ruining the whole of British agriculture. The needs of the country will gain ascendancy over the demands of country-folk, whose sensitivities will have been attended to by the cancellation of May 3. Even if not absolutely under control, foot and mouth will have a critical path towards its end mapped out with enough good faith to satisfy voters getting sick and tired of waiting to do what they have to do.</p> <p>3) In this situation, Mr Blair will look better not worse as time goes on. The army will be helping him, but, despite its childish coyness over the general election, his statement showed him getting his own substantive language right. He balanced the interests adroitly. Though people say he dithered, these are mostly the same people who would have said he was unscrupulous if he had plumped for the earlier date. Outside the political world, people probably saw a leader having to make quite a hard choice. The majority approve of the one he's made.</p> <p>The ripest nonsense is talked about the effect of his delay on ministerial work, as if a whole month of priceless governing time will be lost. There are bills to pass - criminal justice and police, commonhold and leasehold, the homes bill - and a fistful of semi-prepared \"initiatives\" from which to select: on drugs, on Railtrack, on science, on anything that might appeal to this or that constituency. The prime minister can orchestrate them. Voids, in this field, are a myth.</p> <p>While it's true that some ministers have positioned themselves as being opposed to the June decision, leaving Tony to take any flak on his own, it's not clear what result might prompt the shooting. A month spent curbing foot and mouth, having done the decent thing by democracy, will produce a stronger president.</p> <p>4) This episode is, and will continue to be, dominated by spinning. Even more than most in modern times, it's one where perception is political reality. Mr Blair wants to be responsible, but even more to look respectable. He wants to get foot and mouth under control, but above all to make people think he has done. He also wants to change the agenda, as in 2) above.</p> <p>But the government at least can act. For the Tories there is nothing else but spin. There's not a thing they can do, except claim they would have done sooner what has been done now, and keep stretching by a few days the moment when they first presciently proposed it.</p> <p>They're the greatest pretenders, because pretence is all they have. They pretend they want the election now, then they want it postponed <i>sine die</i>. They pretend they can't wait, but know they can't win. Knowing nothing except spin, they furiously fantasise that Mr Blair, concerned only with appearances, may be spinning better than they are.</p> <p>5) Labour will handsomely win the June 7 election. This is the context in which to read reports that Mr Blair has just made the most agonising decision of his time as leader, involving choices fraught with danger, imperilling his party for the sake of his country. We should also remember, when sapient premonitions are solemnly read into the fall of Labour's lead from 19% to 16%, that for the Tories to have any chance of winning, they would now need to be about 10% ahead.</p> <p>This may be a dull campaign, and it will be a long one. Perhaps its principal interest will be watching the effect of party war-chests much diminished by the double bind of being spent too soon and, for the first time, being limited by statute. But the horse race will be neither agonising nor fraught.</p> <p>6) When the campaign begins in earnest, we may be certain of one further thing. It will have nothing to say about the event that caused it to be delayed. The issue at the heart of present discontents will be brazenly ignored. There will be no questions, probably not even from the Liberal Democrats, about the quality of British food, the rapacity of British supermarkets or the condition of British agriculture.</p> <p>These are very pressing problems. It is common ground that they have their place in the explanations both for the spread of foot and mouth and for the negligence that produced the more dangerous crisis of BSE. But it is also common ground that no political party except the Greens is prepared to challenge present orthodoxies. The lobbies are too strong, and political imagination is too limited, to grapple with them. This will be the real and only, and nakedly perverse, scandal of the 2001 election.</p> <p><a href=\"MAILTO:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

Even if not absolutely under control, foot and mouth will have a critical path towards its end mapped out with enough good faith to satisfy voters getting sick and tired of waiting to do what they have to do. 3) In this situation, Mr Blair will look better not worse as time goes on. The army will be helping him, but, despite its childish coyness over the general election, his statement showed him getting his own substantive language right. He balanced the interests adroitly. Though people say he dithered, these are mostly the same people who would have said he was unscrupulous if he had plumped for the earlier date. Outside the political world, people probably saw a leader having to make quite a hard choice. The majority approve of the one he's made. The ripest nonsense is talked about the effect of his delay on ministerial work, as if a whole month of priceless governing time will be lost. There are bills to pass - criminal justice and police, commonhold and leasehold, the homes bill - and a fistful of semi-prepared \"initiatives\" from which to select: on drugs, on Railtrack, on science, on anything that might appeal to this or that constituency. The prime minister can orchestrate them. Voids, in this field, are a myth. While it's true that some ministers have positioned themselves as being opposed to the June decision, leaving Tony to take any flak on his own, it's not clear what result might prompt the shooting. A month spent curbing foot and mouth, having done the decent thing by democracy, will produce a stronger president. 4) This episode is, and will continue to be, dominated by spinning. Even more than most in modern times, it's one where perception is political reality. Mr Blair wants to be responsible, but even more to look respectable. He wants to get foot and mouth under control, but above all to make people think he has done. He also wants to change the agenda, as in 2) above. But the government at least can act. For the Tories there is nothing else but spin. There's not a thing they can do, except claim they would have done sooner what has been done now, and keep stretching by a few days the moment when they first presciently proposed it. They're the greatest pretenders, because pretence is all they have. They pretend they want the election now, then they want it postponed sine die. They pretend they can't wait, but know they can't win. Knowing nothing except spin, they furiously fantasise that Mr Blair, concerned only with appearances, may be spinning better than they are. 5) Labour will handsomely win the June 7 election. This is the context in which to read reports that Mr Blair has just made the most agonising decision of his time as leader, involving choices fraught with danger, imperilling his party for the sake of his country. We should also remember, when sapient premonitions are solemnly read into the fall of Labour's lead from 19% to 16%, that for the Tories to have any chance of winning, they would now need to be about 10% ahead. This may be a dull campaign, and it will be a long one. Perhaps its principal interest will be watching the effect of party war-chests much diminished by the double bind of being spent too soon and, for the first time, being limited by statute. But the horse race will be neither agonising nor fraught. 6) When the campaign begins in earnest, we may be certain of one further thing. It will have nothing to say about the event that caused it to be delayed. The issue at the heart of present discontents will be brazenly ignored. There will be no questions, probably not even from the Liberal Democrats, about the quality of British food, the rapacity of British supermarkets or the condition of British agriculture. These are very pressing problems. It is common ground that they have their place in the explanations both for the spread of foot and mouth and for the negligence that produced the more dangerous crisis of BSE. But it is also common ground that no political party except the Greens is prepared to challenge present orthodoxies. The lobbies are too strong, and political imagination is too limited, to grapple with them. This will be the real and only, and nakedly perverse, scandal of the 2001 election. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

      "bodyText": "The National Magazine Company has rejected plans mooted by the commercial director of Harpers &amp; Queen to drop the word \"Queen\" from the title. The controversial plan to modernise the magazine was put forward by publisher Tess MacLeod Smith when she joined the title from Vogue publisher Conde Nast. However, her plan has been rejected by NatMags chiefs Terry Mansfield and Duncan Edwards. \"There was a feeling it's quite nice to keep the Queen part because it's a very distinguishing part of the brand,\" said Ms MacLeod Smith. But she said she couldn't rule out an overhaul in the future. Ms Macleod Smith confirmed she had suggested dropping \"Queen\" in a bid to position the magazine alongside its US counterpart Harpers Bazaar, which is a high-fashion rival to Vogue. The overhaul would have been consistent with NatMags' strategy for the magazine, which is to move it away from its county-set reputation and towards a younger, more urban readership. Under editor Lucy Yeomans, who joined the magazine in January, Harpers &amp; Queen has already moved to shed its Barbour-wearing image. Ms Yeomans' first issue featured interviews with members of the new \"rockocracy\", such as Jamiroquai frontman Jay Kay and Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood. And Ms Yeomans has aimed to lower the average reader age from 40-plus to around 35. \"It isn't going to happen in the short term but, if you look at the first few issues, its heart is already much closer to Harpers Bazaar,\" said Ms McLeod Smith. Harpers &amp; Queen was formed in 1970 from the merger of the two society magazines Harpers and Queen. Publishing executives and advertisers have felt for some time that dropping \"Queen\", with its associations of royalty, would help modernise the magazine.",

      "body": "<p>The saga of the twins adopted by a British couple via the internet took another twist yesterday when it emerged that the babies' natural parents had asked for them to be declared abducted under the Hague convention. </p> <p>Lawyers for the parents, the Americans Tranda and Aaron Wecker, have asked the official solicitor's child protection office to deal with their request. </p> <p>The news came as Alan and Judith Kilshaw, the UK couple at the centre of the transatlantic legal wrangle, returned to the high court in London to continue their fight to win custody of the nine-month-old girls. </p> <p>It also emerged yesterday that Max Clifford, the PR consultant, has offered to help the parents, who have come under fire for speaking in public about the case after promising that they would not do so. </p> <p>The latest hearing, which could last all week, is taking place in private but a spokesman for the Lord Chancellor's Department said that the natural parents, who are estranged and taking action separately, wanted the babies declared abducted. </p> <p>The US and Britain have signed up to the Hague convention on intercountry adoption, which was designed to set guidelines for international adoptions and restrict child trafficking and fraud. If an application under the convention is successful, the children will have to be returned in the first instance to their home country. </p> <p>Strict security measures were arranged yesterday to ensure no leaks from the latest hearing. Security guards searched the couple, as well as lawyers and officials entering court, to prevent recording equipment being smuggled in. An usher taped paper to the window in the door of the court to obstruct the view. </p> <p>The judge hearing the case, Mr Justice Kirkwood, has been angered by the publicity about the case and has issued stern warnings against those involved revealing what has happened in court. </p> <p>However, the Kilshaws, who claim they paid an American baby broker \u00a38,200 to adopt the sisters, whom they named Belinda and Kimberley, have continued to speak out. Before a hearing last month Mr Kilshaw, 45, a solicitor, spoke on Radio 5 Live about the couple's determination to carry on fighting. They also commented as they arrived at court. </p> <p>The Kilshaws, who are from Buckley, north Wales, arrived for the hearing via the back door of the high court. Mr Kilshaw told a television crew: \"This is all very stressful.\" </p> <p>The babies are in the care of Flintshire social services, and the authority wants them to be made wards of court. </p> <p>Mr Clifford offered to give the couple free advice and guidance. He said: \"If they follow it, it should make the best of a bad situation.\" </p> <p>Allan Levy QC is representng the Kilshaws. Also represented at court are the babies' natural parents, the UK's official solicitor and the states of Arkansas, where the adoption took place, and Missouri, where the girls were born. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Lord Chancellor's Department said that if the judge does make them wards, he would then have to decide whether to deal with the case in this country or send them to the US. </p> <p>A judge in Little Rock, Arkansas, has already annulled the adoption and recommended they be returned to the US. </p> <p>The saga began in January when it emerged that the Kilshaws paid for the children after contacting an internet adoption agency. Two days later an emergency protection order was served on the couple. The twins, swaddled in blankets, were taken into the care of social services and have since been looked after by foster parents. </p> <p>The couple have appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show with Richard and Vickie Allen, from California, who also said they had adopted the two girls but then dropped their claim. The government here has promised to change the law so that a similar case could not happen again. </p> <p>The hearing is expected to last at least until tomorrow.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The saga of the twins adopted by a British couple via the internet took another twist yesterday when it emerged that the babies' natural parents had asked for them to be declared abducted under the Hague convention. Lawyers for the parents, the Americans Tranda and Aaron Wecker, have asked the official solicitor's child protection office to deal with their request. The news came as Alan and Judith Kilshaw, the UK couple at the centre of the transatlantic legal wrangle, returned to the high court in London to continue their fight to win custody of the nine-month-old girls. It also emerged yesterday that Max Clifford, the PR consultant, has offered to help the parents, who have come under fire for speaking in public about the case after promising that they would not do so. The latest hearing, which could last all week, is taking place in private but a spokesman for the Lord Chancellor's Department said that the natural parents, who are estranged and taking action separately, wanted the babies declared abducted. The US and Britain have signed up to the Hague convention on intercountry adoption, which was designed to set guidelines for international adoptions and restrict child trafficking and fraud. If an application under the convention is successful, the children will have to be returned in the first instance to their home country. Strict security measures were arranged yesterday to ensure no leaks from the latest hearing. Security guards searched the couple, as well as lawyers and officials entering court, to prevent recording equipment being smuggled in. An usher taped paper to the window in the door of the court to obstruct the view. The judge hearing the case, Mr Justice Kirkwood, has been angered by the publicity about the case and has issued stern warnings against those involved revealing what has happened in court. However, the Kilshaws, who claim they paid an American baby broker \u00a38,200 to adopt the sisters, whom they named Belinda and Kimberley, have continued to speak out. Before a hearing last month Mr Kilshaw, 45, a solicitor, spoke on Radio 5 Live about the couple's determination to carry on fighting. They also commented as they arrived at court. The Kilshaws, who are from Buckley, north Wales, arrived for the hearing via the back door of the high court. Mr Kilshaw told a television crew: \"This is all very stressful.\" The babies are in the care of Flintshire social services, and the authority wants them to be made wards of court. Mr Clifford offered to give the couple free advice and guidance. He said: \"If they follow it, it should make the best of a bad situation.\" Allan Levy QC is representng the Kilshaws. Also represented at court are the babies' natural parents, the UK's official solicitor and the states of Arkansas, where the adoption took place, and Missouri, where the girls were born. A spokesman for the Lord Chancellor's Department said that if the judge does make them wards, he would then have to decide whether to deal with the case in this country or send them to the US. A judge in Little Rock, Arkansas, has already annulled the adoption and recommended they be returned to the US. The saga began in January when it emerged that the Kilshaws paid for the children after contacting an internet adoption agency. Two days later an emergency protection order was served on the couple. The twins, swaddled in blankets, were taken into the care of social services and have since been looked after by foster parents. The couple have appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show with Richard and Vickie Allen, from California, who also said they had adopted the two girls but then dropped their claim. The government here has promised to change the law so that a similar case could not happen again. The hearing is expected to last at least until tomorrow.",

      "body": "<p>Who would have predicted, when the long-awaited Human Rights Act came into force six months ago, that it would rescue a \u00a3750,000 house condemned as \"the most flagrant breach of planning permission\" from the bulldozers? </p> <p>Councils around the country were stunned last month when Ken and Jacky Duffy won their appeal against New Forest district council's order to demolish their newly built house, erected at twice the size allowed by the council in one of England's prime beauty spots. </p> <p>The inspector who dealt with the appeal, Howard Russon, agreed that the huge structure \"seriously harmed the character and appearance of this vulnerable rural area\". He had no doubt that allowing it to stay \"undermined the objectives of local planning policies aimed at protecting the very special landscape of this part of the New Forest\". </p> <p>But the couple and their three young children would be homeless and possibly bankrupt if the house had to be bulldozed. Russon concluded that this would violate the family's rights under article 8 of the European convention on human rights, the right to private and family life, and allowed their appeal. </p> <p>When the Human Rights Act came into force on October 2, making the European convention part of English law, it was foreseeable that prisoners, asylum seekers and people charged with criminal offences would leap on the bandwagon. Scaremongering predictions of chaos in the courts have not been borne out, but judges have seen a steady flow of human rights cases. Of 87 decided between October and mid-February, 15 succeeded, according to figures from the human rights research unit at King's College law school, University of London. As predicted, the biggest category are claims over the right to a fair trial, guaranteed by article 6 of the convention. </p> <p>What was not foreseen was that this same article - which also includes the right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal in civil matters - would threaten to throw the whole planning system into disarray. </p> <p>In December the high court delivered the first \"declaration of incompatibility\" under the Human Rights Act, exercising a new power for judges to declare that a law passed by the UK Parliament contravenes the European convention. Powers which allow the environment secretary, rather than planning inspectors, to take the final decision himself violated the right to an impartial tribunal, said the judges, because the same person \"cannot be both policy maker and decision taker\". The government has now appealed against the ruling to the House of Lords, where rumour has it that the law lords may overturn it. </p> <p>Ministers predicted in the run-up to the act that declarations of incompatibility would be rare. But the judges have proved them wrong. The second, made last month by the court of appeal in a case brought by a paranoid schizophrenic killer in Broadmoor, will lead to the release of dozens of patients, say mental health lawyers. The court held that procedures laid down by the Mental Health Act, under which patients detained against their will may apply for release, breach their right to liberty, guaranteed by article 5, because they reverse the burden of proof and put the onus on the patient. </p> <p>In two other cases the courts are actively considering making a declaration of incompatibility - the House of Lords in a challenge to \"rape shield\" laws banning questioning of rape complainants about their past sex life, and the court of appeal in a claim over a section of the Consumer Credit Act which the judges thought a breach of the human rights of lenders. </p> <p>Meanwhile, celebrities are queueing up to use the act to carve out the right of privacy they previously lacked under English law, and the judges seem only too keen to help them. In the case brought by Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones over sneak photos of their wedding published in Hello! magazine, Lord Justice Sedley declared: \"We have reached a point at which it can be said with confidence that the law recognises and will appropriately protect a right of personal privacy.\" </p> <p>The media feared that a burgeoning privacy law could threaten freedom of expression - guaranteed by article 10 of the convention - and lobbied successfully for a clause to be added to the Human Rights Act imposing extra hurdles where an injunction is sought to stop publication in advance. This was hailed as a victory for the press, making freedom of expression the trump card that would outweigh other rights. But judges' pronouncements in the Hello! case and others suggest that they may not see it quite that way. </p> <p>Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, the killers of the toddler James Bulger, invoked the act and won an unprecedented lifetime court order banning the media from publishing any details of their new identities and whereabouts once they leave custody later this year. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, president of the high court's family division, thought their privacy claim might not have been enough to justify such a drastic curb on free speech. The clinching argument for her was that revenge attacks threatened their right to life (article 2) and to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment (article 3). </p> <p>Mary Cuneen, associate director of the civil rights group Liberty, which runs an advice helpline for lawyers on the act, says fair trial issues have been the largest area for queries. But article 8 - respect for private and family life - comes next, covering a wide range of issues including the rights of transsexuals, gay relationships, access to children, CCTV surveillance and employers' rights to employees' personal data. </p> <p>Deaths in custody and the failure of prisons to prevent suicides look like fruitful areas for the future. In June, Liberty is taking a case against the Home Office to the high court over the death of a prisoner, Paul Wright, from an asthma attack, claiming that his right to life was violated and that he was subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment. </p> <p>Last week Lord Bingham, the senior law lord, predicted that the Lord Chancellor and the law lords would face a court challenge over their dual role as both judges and members of the legislature. The issue of whether someone who is both judge and legislator can be considered independent and impartial \"is a question which I believe will become litigious at some point,\" he told the joint lords and commons human rights committee. </p> <p>Summing up the Human Rights Act after its first six months, Lord Bingham thought it was \"unquestionably a major advance\" for the UK's justice system. The fact that litigants had to go to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg until last October to assert human rights claims had caused \"an insidious corruption of popular confidence in our justice system\".

      "bodyText": "Who would have predicted, when the long-awaited Human Rights Act came into force six months ago, that it would rescue a \u00a3750,000 house condemned as \"the most flagrant breach of planning permission\" from the bulldozers? Councils around the country were stunned last month when Ken and Jacky Duffy won their appeal against New Forest district council's order to demolish their newly built house, erected at twice the size allowed by the council in one of England's prime beauty spots. The inspector who dealt with the appeal, Howard Russon, agreed that the huge structure \"seriously harmed the character and appearance of this vulnerable rural area\". He had no doubt that allowing it to stay \"undermined the objectives of local planning policies aimed at protecting the very special landscape of this part of the New Forest\". But the couple and their three young children would be homeless and possibly bankrupt if the house had to be bulldozed. Russon concluded that this would violate the family's rights under article 8 of the European convention on human rights, the right to private and family life, and allowed their appeal. When the Human Rights Act came into force on October 2, making the European convention part of English law, it was foreseeable that prisoners, asylum seekers and people charged with criminal offences would leap on the bandwagon. Scaremongering predictions of chaos in the courts have not been borne out, but judges have seen a steady flow of human rights cases. Of 87 decided between October and mid-February, 15 succeeded, according to figures from the human rights research unit at King's College law school, University of London. As predicted, the biggest category are claims over the right to a fair trial, guaranteed by article 6 of the convention. What was not foreseen was that this same article - which also includes the right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal in civil matters - would threaten to throw the whole planning system into disarray. In December the high court delivered the first \"declaration of incompatibility\" under the Human Rights Act, exercising a new power for judges to declare that a law passed by the UK Parliament contravenes the European convention. Powers which allow the environment secretary, rather than planning inspectors, to take the final decision himself violated the right to an impartial tribunal, said the judges, because the same person \"cannot be both policy maker and decision taker\". The government has now appealed against the ruling to the House of Lords, where rumour has it that the law lords may overturn it. Ministers predicted in the run-up to the act that declarations of incompatibility would be rare. But the judges have proved them wrong. The second, made last month by the court of appeal in a case brought by a paranoid schizophrenic killer in Broadmoor, will lead to the release of dozens of patients, say mental health lawyers. The court held that procedures laid down by the Mental Health Act, under which patients detained against their will may apply for release, breach their right to liberty, guaranteed by article 5, because they reverse the burden of proof and put the onus on the patient. In two other cases the courts are actively considering making a declaration of incompatibility - the House of Lords in a challenge to \"rape shield\" laws banning questioning of rape complainants about their past sex life, and the court of appeal in a claim over a section of the Consumer Credit Act which the judges thought a breach of the human rights of lenders. Meanwhile, celebrities are queueing up to use the act to carve out the right of privacy they previously lacked under English law, and the judges seem only too keen to help them. In the case brought by Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones over sneak photos of their wedding published in Hello! magazine, Lord Justice Sedley declared: \"We have reached a point at which it can be said with confidence that the law recognises and will appropriately protect a right of personal privacy.\" The media feared that a burgeoning privacy law could threaten freedom of expression - guaranteed by article 10 of the convention - and lobbied successfully for a clause to be added to the Human Rights Act imposing extra hurdles where an injunction is sought to stop publication in advance. This was hailed as a victory for the press, making freedom of expression the trump card that would outweigh other rights. But judges' pronouncements in the Hello! case and others suggest that they may not see it quite that way. Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, the killers of the toddler James Bulger, invoked the act and won an unprecedented lifetime court order banning the media from publishing any details of their new identities and whereabouts once they leave custody later this year. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, president of the high court's family division, thought their privacy claim might not have been enough to justify such a drastic curb on free speech. The clinching argument for her was that revenge attacks threatened their right to life (article 2) and to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment (article 3). Mary Cuneen, associate director of the civil rights group Liberty, which runs an advice helpline for lawyers on the act, says fair trial issues have been the largest area for queries. But article 8 - respect for private and family life - comes next, covering a wide range of issues including the rights of transsexuals, gay relationships, access to children, CCTV surveillance and employers' rights to employees' personal data. Deaths in custody and the failure of prisons to prevent suicides look like fruitful areas for the future. In June, Liberty is taking a case against the Home Office to the high court over the death of a prisoner, Paul Wright, from an asthma attack, claiming that his right to life was violated and that he was subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment. Last week Lord Bingham, the senior law lord, predicted that the Lord Chancellor and the law lords would face a court challenge over their dual role as both judges and members of the legislature. The issue of whether someone who is both judge and legislator can be considered independent and impartial \"is a question which I believe will become litigious at some point,\" he told the joint lords and commons human rights committee. Summing up the Human Rights Act after its first six months, Lord Bingham thought it was \"unquestionably a major advance\" for the UK's justice system. The fact that litigants had to go to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg until last October to assert human rights claims had caused \"an insidious corruption of popular confidence in our justice system\". He added: \"It seems to me highly destructive of popular confidence in our own system of justice for people to think they had to go elsewhere to have their rights protected. If rights are to be protected they should be protected here.\" Getting in on the act Subject: Drink-driving, speed cameras and self-incrimination Claim: Margaret Brown, found drunk by police at an all-night superstore, confessed she was the driver of the car in the carpark. She argued that section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, which makes it an offence not to name the driver, breached the right to protection against self-incrimination Outcome: Scotland's high court threw out the prosecution, ruling that section 172 (which also applied to cars caught on speed cameras) breached the right to a fair trial.

About 30 teenagers were running around virtual streets, shooting at virtual enemies. Just a few years earlier, in the real street outside, their fathers - and possibly even elder brothers - fought real gun battles during the Lebanese civil war.</p> <p>Computer games may be realistic, but at least they do not purport to be anything other than a game. If some of the players can't tell the difference, that's not necessarily the makers' fault.</p> <p>It's a different matter, however, when fiction purports to be journalism. There's a website called debka.com that describes itself as \"an internet weekly on intelligence, politics and terrorism\" and \"the decision-maker's indispensable tool\".</p> <p>For a subscription of $120, you can have it emailed every week - which at least suggests its content is worth paying for. Debka, which is based in Jerusalem, hints at having exclusive access to Israeli intelligence sources and makes a habit of mis-spelling Arabic names.</p> <p>A banner at the top of each page says: \"We start where the media stop\" - a claim that few could disagree with, since Debka blends fact, fantasy and propaganda in ways that make it difficult to separate one from the other.</p> <p>One of Debka's recurring obsessions is its belief that the PLO, Hizbullah, Syria, Iraq and Iran have all joined a secret alliance against Israel. Many of its stories are tailored to support this theory.</p> <p>Anyone who has witnessed the repeated failure of Arab countries to agree on a united course of action about any issue of importance ought to have serious doubts about the likelihood of such an alliance.</p> <p>Nevertheless, some elements in the Israeli government and military seem intent on promoting the idea that it exists - and Debka supports them in their efforts.</p> <p>The motive of these elements is not entirely clear. Some suggest they are seeking to provide justification for an attack on Lebanon and Syria. Perhaps more likely, they may be trying to persuade the US to grant Israel a free rein in the region and provide it with more weapons.</p> <p>But there certainly is a political motive behind the stories of a PLO-Hizbullah-Syrian-Iraqi-Iranian alliance, and they should be treated with suspicion unless supported by more evidence than Debka is able to provide.</p> <p>A recent \"special expos\u00e9\" of the new Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, gives a flavour of Debka's journalistic methods and content:</p> <p>As a child, Debka says, Bashar \"was always rather strange - virtually uneducable, quick-tempered and given to petty cruelties against animals and weaker playmates. No one bothered to correct his ways, never imagining he would ever come to high office.\"</p> <p>The death of Bashar's elder brother (whom many people had expected to become the next president) suddenly changed all that, Debka says. His ailing father, Hafez al-Assad, desperately sought to prepare Bashar for the presidency.</p> <p>According to Debka, he \"turned to the adept image-makers of British and French intelligence, asking them to fabricate for the youthful Beshar [sic] a Western-educated, modern Arab intellectual facade.\"</p> <p>As a result, Debka says, Britain cooked up a fictitious story that Bashar had studied ophthalmic surgery in London - though why the British were so obliging in this matter is not explained.</p> <p>The Americans and Israelis knew about the Syrian-British scheme, Debka adds, but agreed to keep quiet when both Bashar and Hafez al-Assad promised to be nice to Washington and to \"sign peace with Israel on acceptable terms\".</p> <p>Debka complains: \"After several months in power, Beshar shows no sign of keeping either of those promises.\"</p> <p>The only evidence cited by Debka to support this fanciful tale is that \"the young Syrian president studiously avoids contacts with foreigners and medical people\", so as not to reveal \"his lack of medical knowledge and halting English.\"</p> <p>It adds: \"When he cannot avoid these contacts, he listens and nods but says little.\" The rest of the story is attributed to unnamed \"intelligence sources\".</p> <p>Intelligence sources are always a useful standby in the absence of any firm evidence: the nature of their work not only suggests they have special knowledge, but also provides an obvious reason why they cannot be identified.</p> <p>People who are not identified cannot be held reponsible for what they are reported to have said.</p> <p>One of the problems with Debka is that its stories usually have just enough of a factual basis to sound plausible - indeed, some of them may even be true. They are also sufficiently well told and interesting to trickle out into popular gossip and occasionally into the mainstream media.</p> <p>Unprovable (and probably spurious) claims about threats to Israel from Iranian Republican Guards in Lebanon and Hizbullah guerrillas in the occupied territories which originated in Debka have recently re-surfaced in two respected publications: Jane's Foreign Report and the Saudi-owned daily, Ash-Sharq al-Awsat.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:brian.whitaker@theguardian.com\"> brian.whitaker@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/0,2759,377264,00.html\">Israel &amp; the Middle East</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/0,2759,180403,00.html\">Iraq</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/yemen/0,2759,193338,00.html\">Yemen</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/The_Kurds/0,2759,192981,00.html\">The Kurds</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28brian+whitaker%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=brian+whitaker&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Brian Whitaker</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.al-bab.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">Al-bab.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.arabicnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Arabic News</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.middleeastwire.com\" target=\"_new\">Middle East News Online</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.middleeastdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Middle East Daily</a></p>",

It's a different matter, however, when fiction purports to be journalism. There's a website called debka.com that describes itself as \"an internet weekly on intelligence, politics and terrorism\" and \"the decision-maker's indispensable tool\". For a subscription of $120, you can have it emailed every week - which at least suggests its content is worth paying for. Debka, which is based in Jerusalem, hints at having exclusive access to Israeli intelligence sources and makes a habit of mis-spelling Arabic names. A banner at the top of each page says: \"We start where the media stop\" - a claim that few could disagree with, since Debka blends fact, fantasy and propaganda in ways that make it difficult to separate one from the other. One of Debka's recurring obsessions is its belief that the PLO, Hizbullah, Syria, Iraq and Iran have all joined a secret alliance against Israel. Many of its stories are tailored to support this theory. Anyone who has witnessed the repeated failure of Arab countries to agree on a united course of action about any issue of importance ought to have serious doubts about the likelihood of such an alliance. Nevertheless, some elements in the Israeli government and military seem intent on promoting the idea that it exists - and Debka supports them in their efforts. The motive of these elements is not entirely clear. Some suggest they are seeking to provide justification for an attack on Lebanon and Syria. Perhaps more likely, they may be trying to persuade the US to grant Israel a free rein in the region and provide it with more weapons. But there certainly is a political motive behind the stories of a PLO-Hizbullah-Syrian-Iraqi-Iranian alliance, and they should be treated with suspicion unless supported by more evidence than Debka is able to provide. A recent \"special expos\u00e9\" of the new Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, gives a flavour of Debka's journalistic methods and content: As a child, Debka says, Bashar \"was always rather strange - virtually uneducable, quick-tempered and given to petty cruelties against animals and weaker playmates. No one bothered to correct his ways, never imagining he would ever come to high office.\" The death of Bashar's elder brother (whom many people had expected to become the next president) suddenly changed all that, Debka says. His ailing father, Hafez al-Assad, desperately sought to prepare Bashar for the presidency. According to Debka, he \"turned to the adept image-makers of British and French intelligence, asking them to fabricate for the youthful Beshar [sic] a Western-educated, modern Arab intellectual facade.\" As a result, Debka says, Britain cooked up a fictitious story that Bashar had studied ophthalmic surgery in London - though why the British were so obliging in this matter is not explained. The Americans and Israelis knew about the Syrian-British scheme, Debka adds, but agreed to keep quiet when both Bashar and Hafez al-Assad promised to be nice to Washington and to \"sign peace with Israel on acceptable terms\". Debka complains: \"After several months in power, Beshar shows no sign of keeping either of those promises.\" The only evidence cited by Debka to support this fanciful tale is that \"the young Syrian president studiously avoids contacts with foreigners and medical people\", so as not to reveal \"his lack of medical knowledge and halting English.\" It adds: \"When he cannot avoid these contacts, he listens and nods but says little.\" The rest of the story is attributed to unnamed \"intelligence sources\". Intelligence sources are always a useful standby in the absence of any firm evidence: the nature of their work not only suggests they have special knowledge, but also provides an obvious reason why they cannot be identified. People who are not identified cannot be held reponsible for what they are reported to have said. One of the problems with Debka is that its stories usually have just enough of a factual basis to sound plausible - indeed, some of them may even be true. They are also sufficiently well told and interesting to trickle out into popular gossip and occasionally into the mainstream media. Unprovable (and probably spurious) claims about threats to Israel from Iranian Republican Guards in Lebanon and Hizbullah guerrillas in the occupied territories which originated in Debka have recently re-surfaced in two respected publications: Jane's Foreign Report and the Saudi-owned daily, Ash-Sharq al-Awsat.

      "body": "<p>In 1998, Cherie Booth represented Lisa Grant and Jill Percy in a discrimination case against South West Trains. The pair, who were long-term partners, were not granted the same travel perks as heterosexual employees of the company. Booth argued that discriminating on the grounds of sexuality was as unlawful as gender discrimination. The Human Rights Act was not in force. The case was lost.</p> <p>Last week, in her role as a human rights lawyer, with her own special set of chambers to deal with human rights issues, Booth's approach was different. She was arguing that sexual orientation is not a human rights issue, and that homosexuals who are abused because of their sexuality, have no remedy under the law.</p> <p>If lesbians were foxes, it might be different. This is just a woman hounded out of her job. And not even a woman, according to Booth, who maintained in court that the Sex Discrimination Act protects women but not lesbians.</p> <p>Can we get this straight? Only a woman can be a lesbian but lesbians are not women? If kids pour cat food into your coat and shout \"Pussy\", that has nothing to do with being a woman. Yells of \"lezzie\" and \"dyke\" are because you are queer, not because you are female. It seems that the law is seeking to confirm the prejudices of homophobes everywhere - that lesbians are not \"real\" women.</p> <p>A \"real\" women is one sexually available to men - though I am not sure where this leaves nuns. The definition of a \"real\" man, is not a man sexually available to women, but one who knows where his loyalties lie - that is, with other men. Queer or not, he bonds with and maintains the power structures that privilege men above women. This is why many gay men can live without difficulty in the world. The ones who do get into trouble are the ones who expose the system in some way, either by effeminacy or cross-dressing or outspokenness, or deliberately identifying with women. Such men are a threat in the way that all lesbians are a threat: they upset the pecking order.</p> <p>Shirley Pearce had taught science at Mayfield school in Portsmouth for 15 years. She had a good record and was a dedicated career teacher - just the kind the government is desperate to keep. In 1990, very privately, she started visiting gay clubs. In a small town word soon gets out and the trouble at school began.</p> <p>She put up with this for five years, with little help from her colleagues or her boss. We all know what kids can be like - they gang up, and they pick on outsiders. Part of the role of education is to lead children out of this kind of tribal behaviour. Victimising difference is a bad model for adulthood. You need not be a supporter of gay rights to understand that tolerance is essential for multi-cultural city life - the life that most people will be leading in the 21st century. Love thy neighbour becomes more urgent when we cannot avoid her.</p> <p>Shirley Pearce was told by her head teacher to \"grit her teeth\". She was advised to take leave of absence on health grounds and, finally, she resigned. An industrial tribunal and an employment appeal tribunal both dismissed her case. Now Stonewall, the equal rights group, is supporting her in the courts.</p> <p>Laura Cox, QC, defending, and Booth, for the school, have tied themselves up in knots over the case because there is no law. Cox is using Booth's old line that sex includes sexuality, with the added kick that none of this could have happened to a gay man because abuse is gender specific. Booth argues that the school had no duty to protect Pearce. Mayfield may not have acted well, but it acted legally.</p> <p>Whatever happened to natural justice? No one should be discriminated against because they are different. If we don't have a law against it, let's draft one now and stop wasting time and money and ruining lives, while lawyers swank about practising their rhetoric.</p> <p>In Britain we prefer case law to legislation. \"Meaning is use\" as Wittgenstein put it. The question is whether legal interpretations are keeping up with what is happening in society. One of the things happening is that gay people no longer want to live in the closet or have cat food thrown at them when they come out.</p> <p>The law is going to have to recognise gay rights, including partnership, taxation and employment issues. Many thought Labour would encourage this change, but what is the meaning or the use of a Human Rights Act, when one of its architects, also the wife of the prime minister, argues that it does not apply to lesbians?</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1998, Cherie Booth represented Lisa Grant and Jill Percy in a discrimination case against South West Trains. The pair, who were long-term partners, were not granted the same travel perks as heterosexual employees of the company. Booth argued that discriminating on the grounds of sexuality was as unlawful as gender discrimination. The Human Rights Act was not in force. The case was lost. Last week, in her role as a human rights lawyer, with her own special set of chambers to deal with human rights issues, Booth's approach was different. She was arguing that sexual orientation is not a human rights issue, and that homosexuals who are abused because of their sexuality, have no remedy under the law. If lesbians were foxes, it might be different. This is just a woman hounded out of her job. And not even a woman, according to Booth, who maintained in court that the Sex Discrimination Act protects women but not lesbians. Can we get this straight? Only a woman can be a lesbian but lesbians are not women? If kids pour cat food into your coat and shout \"Pussy\", that has nothing to do with being a woman. Yells of \"lezzie\" and \"dyke\" are because you are queer, not because you are female. It seems that the law is seeking to confirm the prejudices of homophobes everywhere - that lesbians are not \"real\" women. A \"real\" women is one sexually available to men - though I am not sure where this leaves nuns. The definition of a \"real\" man, is not a man sexually available to women, but one who knows where his loyalties lie - that is, with other men. Queer or not, he bonds with and maintains the power structures that privilege men above women. This is why many gay men can live without difficulty in the world. The ones who do get into trouble are the ones who expose the system in some way, either by effeminacy or cross-dressing or outspokenness, or deliberately identifying with women. Such men are a threat in the way that all lesbians are a threat: they upset the pecking order. Shirley Pearce had taught science at Mayfield school in Portsmouth for 15 years. She had a good record and was a dedicated career teacher - just the kind the government is desperate to keep. In 1990, very privately, she started visiting gay clubs. In a small town word soon gets out and the trouble at school began. She put up with this for five years, with little help from her colleagues or her boss. We all know what kids can be like - they gang up, and they pick on outsiders. Part of the role of education is to lead children out of this kind of tribal behaviour. Victimising difference is a bad model for adulthood. You need not be a supporter of gay rights to understand that tolerance is essential for multi-cultural city life - the life that most people will be leading in the 21st century. Love thy neighbour becomes more urgent when we cannot avoid her. Shirley Pearce was told by her head teacher to \"grit her teeth\". She was advised to take leave of absence on health grounds and, finally, she resigned. An industrial tribunal and an employment appeal tribunal both dismissed her case. Now Stonewall, the equal rights group, is supporting her in the courts. Laura Cox, QC, defending, and Booth, for the school, have tied themselves up in knots over the case because there is no law. Cox is using Booth's old line that sex includes sexuality, with the added kick that none of this could have happened to a gay man because abuse is gender specific. Booth argues that the school had no duty to protect Pearce. Mayfield may not have acted well, but it acted legally. Whatever happened to natural justice? No one should be discriminated against because they are different. If we don't have a law against it, let's draft one now and stop wasting time and money and ruining lives, while lawyers swank about practising their rhetoric. In Britain we prefer case law to legislation. \"Meaning is use\" as Wittgenstein put it. The question is whether legal interpretations are keeping up with what is happening in society. One of the things happening is that gay people no longer want to live in the closet or have cat food thrown at them when they come out. The law is going to have to recognise gay rights, including partnership, taxation and employment issues. Many thought Labour would encourage this change, but what is the meaning or the use of a Human Rights Act, when one of its architects, also the wife of the prime minister, argues that it does not apply to lesbians?",

Each night, the exhibitors were told to leave the exhibition hall at 5pm and were not allowed back in until the following morning. He knew, he said, that in the 12 hours in which he was denied access, his hosts were busy taking his gear to pieces. If they concluded they could copy it, they would never buy it. He left without making a sale.</p> <p>It is a little more complicated to copy a spy-plane, but George Bush has a similar problem right now. Every hour that his plane remains on the ground at that Chinese airbase on Hainan Island gives the Chinese time to crawl all over this treasure, cataloguing its classified mysteries. The situation is more than embarrassing.</p> <p>Who exactly is to blame for the incident will continue to be the subject of argument. The US claims the plane was in international airspace and that the Chinese fighters - who have been playing such dangerous games of tag in recent months that the US had already lodged a protest - came too close. The US plane is a slow-moving and heavily laden turbo-prop and not something that any pilot would throw around the skies. With the reservation that Washington has refused to give the plane's coordinates at the time of Sunday's incident, I incline to believe the US version.</p> <p>The Chinese claims on the South China Sea are grossly exaggerated and accepted by nobody. When the Chinese say that the US plane was over Chinese territory, therefore, it should be taken with a pinch of salt. Besides, the Chinese military are deeply upset by the defection in December of Colonel Xu Junping, director of the Chinese defence ministry's liaison office for the United States, an incident that has led to the cancellation of other visits and military exchanges.</p> <p>The US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, has, in turn, frozen 40 exchanges planned for this year as part of a harder line towards China. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that Chinese irritation overcame prudence. But arguing over who caused the incident does not change the fact that it offers the Chinese a heaven-sent opportunity for blackmail at a moment of already tense relations.</p> <p>As with the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, such episodes arouse genuinely felt nationalist resentment in China which, with official sanction, easily spills over into public demonstrations and gives the government the excuse to hang tough. Right now, the view in Beijing is that there's a lot to hang tough about. Since Bush took office, the tone of US foreign policy has shifted from one of cooperation to a bluntly stated view that China is a potential military competitor, exacerbating the tensions endemic in the China policy minefield. What we have now is a stand-off between two powerful states, both of which have deep internal divisions about the conduct of foreign policy and both of which have adopted muscular nationalism as the dominant tone in their diplomacy.</p> <p>Add to that confrontation a set of real and intractable disagreements and the situation becomes delicate indeed. Since Bush came to power, he has antagonised the Chinese through his cavalier approach to the warming relations with North Korea, through his enthusiasm for missile defence, his commitment to arms sales to Taiwan and his decision to pursue a resolution in Geneva censuring China for human rights violations. He has alarmed America's other Asian partners and enraged the European Union by the first two items of that list - as well, of course, as his rejection of the Kyoto accords and his cavalier dismissal of the arms control record.</p> <p>All of this has left the new administration with spiky relationships around the globe, something that Bush may soon learn does not help when difficult situations, such as that created by this latest spy-plane mishap in China, are to be resolved.</p> <p>Not all of Bush's China list is bad: the only disgrace in the US desire to bring about a human rights vote in Geneva is that the EU, including of course our own ethically dimensioned government, is once again failing to support it, despite the continuing deterioration in China's human rights behaviour. Taiwan, too, needs support in the face of Beijing's continuing insistence that Taiwan will be brought back into the fold by fair means or foul.</p> <p>The issue, though, is the more sensitive if it is read in conjunction with missile defence. The Chinese regard the US missile defence proposals as aimed at neutralising China's long range nuclear arsenal, a system that, as yet, poses little direct threat to the US. A more urgent cause of friction, though, is in the related area of theatre defence, which leads directly to the question of Taiwan.</p> <p>Taiwan is currently facing a build-up of Chinese missiles, put in place to add weight to Beijing's invitation to Taiwan to surrender to the People's Republic - or, at least, to refrain from a declaration of independence. There are currently 300 short range missiles facing Taiwan from China, and the number increases by around 50 a year. High on Taiwan's wish list of arms from the US are four Arleigh Burke-class destroyers equipped with the Aegis radar system and PAC-3 missile systems - improved versions of the Patriot. They would protect Taiwan's navy in the first instance but would also offer a potential platform for theatre missile defence linked to a strategic defence system.</p> <p>As Donald Rumsfeld observed recently when asked about the Chinese position, \"If some country decided it wanted to be aggressive to its neighbours and acquire additional territory by force, then having a missile defence system is not a bad idea.\" But such a system would go further, always assuming that it can be made to work: it would neutralise the medium range missiles that China has deployed and which currently threaten India and Japan. It's a prospect that is hardly likely to soften the hearts of the Chinese military as they reflect on what price they should try to exact from the US for the safe return of the spy-plane and its 24-man crew. What, then, will the Chinese demand? The resolution in Geneva is an embarrassment to China but can hardly be withdrawn now. In any event, it is likely to fail unless the US throws serious diplomatic weight behind it. The Aegis sale to Taiwan, on the other hand, due to be decided this month, can be delayed, if not denied. There, however, Bush is in the unenviable position of being caught between the conflicting views that - in the apparent absence of a president with any of his own - are fighting it out over US foreign policy.</p> <p>The Republican party is divided between the hardliners who see China as a potential enemy and the business lobby pursuing its usual agenda of trade no matter what. (The same dilemma, on a smaller scale, presents itself over Cuba.) Among Bush's advisers, there is a perceptible difference between the more conciliatory State Department and the hardline military. So far, Bush's foreign policy has come across as comic cuts nationalism. In China, he faces an adversary whose nationalism is at least as deeply rooted as his own and which regards the US with profound mistrust.

      "body": "<p>The diplomatic standoff following the emergency landing of a US spy plane on China's Hainan island is loaded with the imagery of the cold war. It was caused by a seemingly random event, a midair collision with a Chinese fighter jet, yet the accident and all the accompanying tension has uncannily presaged a real chill in relations that many expect to set in this year.</p> <p>The sharp exchanges over the US EP-3 will seem like idle banter if President Bush acts on the advice of a naval commission and equips Taiwan's defences with the $1.2bn (\u00a3800m) state-of-the-art destroyers Taipei wants. Each is equipped with the US navy's most advanced anti-missile radar system, the Aegis, designed to spot up to 200 incoming missiles, and to direct intercepting missiles towards them.</p> <p>The Bush administration says the sale will not go ahead if China scales back its missile buildup across the 100-mile straits from Taiwan, but the change in stance is unmistakable. President Clinton turned back the self-governing island's request for the destroyers last year, deciding it would be destabilising. His successor looks set to call Beijing's bluff.</p> <p>Admiral Dennis Blair, the commander of US troops in the Pacific, told Congress last week that China has 300 short range and medium range missiles pointed at Taiwan, and had been increasing the force by 50 missiles a year. His testimony has helped convince some prominent Democrats to support the sale of the destroyers.</p> <p>The decision will be a further litmus test of the Bush administration's foreign policy after a string of decisions that have jarred some of Washington closest allies - like the announcement last week to abandon the Kyoto global warming treaty, the end of negotiations with North Korea and the green light given earlier this year to the development of an anti-ballistic National Missile Defence system.</p> <p>All three decisions reflect long-advertised convictions among the inner core of foreign policy advisors around Mr Bush - in particular vice president Cheney and the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld - and a defeat to the \"outsider\" secretary of state, Colin Powell, who was brought onto the campaign as an icon of moderate Republicanism, and who now looks increasingly irrelevant and ornamental.

      "bodyText": "The diplomatic standoff following the emergency landing of a US spy plane on China's Hainan island is loaded with the imagery of the cold war. It was caused by a seemingly random event, a midair collision with a Chinese fighter jet, yet the accident and all the accompanying tension has uncannily presaged a real chill in relations that many expect to set in this year. The sharp exchanges over the US EP-3 will seem like idle banter if President Bush acts on the advice of a naval commission and equips Taiwan's defences with the $1.2bn (\u00a3800m) state-of-the-art destroyers Taipei wants. Each is equipped with the US navy's most advanced anti-missile radar system, the Aegis, designed to spot up to 200 incoming missiles, and to direct intercepting missiles towards them. The Bush administration says the sale will not go ahead if China scales back its missile buildup across the 100-mile straits from Taiwan, but the change in stance is unmistakable. President Clinton turned back the self-governing island's request for the destroyers last year, deciding it would be destabilising. His successor looks set to call Beijing's bluff. Admiral Dennis Blair, the commander of US troops in the Pacific, told Congress last week that China has 300 short range and medium range missiles pointed at Taiwan, and had been increasing the force by 50 missiles a year. His testimony has helped convince some prominent Democrats to support the sale of the destroyers. The decision will be a further litmus test of the Bush administration's foreign policy after a string of decisions that have jarred some of Washington closest allies - like the announcement last week to abandon the Kyoto global warming treaty, the end of negotiations with North Korea and the green light given earlier this year to the development of an anti-ballistic National Missile Defence system. All three decisions reflect long-advertised convictions among the inner core of foreign policy advisors around Mr Bush - in particular vice president Cheney and the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld - and a defeat to the \"outsider\" secretary of state, Colin Powell, who was brought onto the campaign as an icon of moderate Republicanism, and who now looks increasingly irrelevant and ornamental. Just days before talks with Pyongyang were dumped, Mr Powell had been saying that he wanted to pick up negotiations where President Clinton had left off. He had not been informed. The policy choices over Kyoto, North Korea, and NMD showed who is in charge in the Bush foreign policy team. The decision over the Aegis will demonstrate how far the hawks are willing to go in the gathering showdown with China and the return to cold war-style superpower strategy. The options are exquisitely calibrated. The administration could choose to give Taiwan Kidd-class destroyers, which are a generation old and originally made to equip the Shah of Iran's navy (they are sometimes called \"Ayatollah-class destroyers\"). They are equipped with a radar system which is not quite as good as the Aegis, and not nearly so expensive. Supplying the Kidds to Taiwan would also leave the option of ultimately providing the Burke-class ships, which would take up to eight more years to build and deliver. The Bush administration would still look tough, but without the Aegis, Taiwan would not be in a position to block the Chinese missile arsenal. That confrontation, the most serious in Sino-American relations for many years, could be left for another day.

Pam Kinnunen London Wonderful piece! Even on the economic case the slaughter is lunacy: \u00a39bn threatened to save \u00a3310m? I have repeatedly sought answers in parlia ment. We are blindly following the crazy self-interested mythology of the NFU and Maff. Paul Flynn MP We are told that the EU policy of not vaccinating livestock is to protect its exports to parts of the world, like Japan and North America, which will only buy meat from countries that do not vaccinate. However, only 5% of EU sales are to these countries. The other benefit is that it allows Europe to ban imports of cheap meat from countries like Russia, most of Africa and South America. We all know of the massive financial costs of the huge slaughter that is going on. Is it possible this is all to uphold a policy whose real purpose is to prevent free trade with the poorer countries? Henry Stewart London henry@happy.co.uk Where the cull involves the extermination of rare and valuable breeds, such as Herdwicks and Swaledales and the consequent destruction of the present vegetation of the fells, surely it is both unscientific, immoral and contrary to our economic interest? Why are elephants, whales, pandas and tigers more deserving of protection than our own rare breeds? MN Rendel London You repeat the mistaken assertion that sheep farming is essential to Cumbrian tourism because it helps preserve the \"picturesque grassland\" (Leader, March 30). But there are plenty of us tourists who'd rather have scrubland, however shabby, because of its greater biodiversity. At present the land is overgrazed and sterile because of sheep farming.

      "body": "<p>My morning route to work in London takes me over a railway bridge. A traveller on the top deck of a bus at this point can see a junction and a single line curving off into a tunnel. Once there were two lines; once the curve was smooth. Sometime in the early 90s, however, I noticed that one of the lines had been taken up and that the curve was really a series of angled straight rails. Bill Armstrong, a former railway engineer, described this to me as \"a threepenny-bit curve\", after the old British 12-sided coin. The rails had probably been used elsewhere, or turned around at the same site, and wanted to assume their previous form, \"to go back,\" as he said, \"to where they lived before\". Also, around the same time, I began to notice weeds here and on other lines; weeds that grew on the ballast sometimes to the size of small shrubs. Even the busy track outside Waterloo terminus had them, with their suggestion of abandoned railways in the Argentinian pampas. I imagined that railways were obeying a new ecological stricture to ban herbicide. The cause was more straightforward.</p> <p>Between 1992 and 1997, the number of workers on Britain's railways fell from 159,000 to 92,000, at a time when the number of trains increased. Within these totals, the numbers of workers permanently employed to maintain and renew the infrastructure fell from 31,000 to between 15,000 and 19,000. In March 1998 the Guardian's transport editor, Keith Harper, interviewed a group of former British Rail workers. They spoke scathingly of the methods of their new employers, the private contractors who worked for Railtrack. One told him: \"At least 50% of the track is on its last legs. If it's not broken rails, it's broken components. If the public knew the full picture, it would be horrified. There are accidents waiting to happen and loads of speed restrictions. Some cowboy the other day forgot to put up a 20mph speed restriction on a 70mph route. How there wasn't an accident I'll never know.\"</p> <p>In November last year, attending a session of the government inquiry into the Ladbroke Grove rail crash before Lord Cullen, I heard the same situation on the track described in a more academic way. Professor Christopher Baldry, head of the department of management and organisation at Stirling University, was giving evidence about safety practices among rail workers, based on recent research. Baldry described the long and unregulated hours that could be worked under the negligent eye of a subcontractor, the lack of communication between train crews, signallers and rail maintenance workers all employed by different companies and often new to their jobs - and the rivalry between different contractors or subcontractors.</p> <p>\"We were given on several occasions evidence that if, for example, track workers from Scotland had been sent down to York to work on a bit of track that was unfamiliar to them, they find themselves working with other employees of a different contractor. Their instinct is to ask local people about the nature of the track. The local people may have been told by their employer, 'Don't talk to these persons because they are employed by the opposition.' \"</p> <p>Familiarity with the track had gone, old patterns of trust had been broken; the price of the competitive spirit. There could be so many different companies employed on the same stretch of line, Baldry said, that it would take \"a very brave person\" to halt the work because of a potential hazard. The system that Baldry mentioned was designed by commercial lawyers, in the legal belief that punishment works, and it involves confusing flows of money and paperwork through many \"interfaces\" - here the term is managerial rather than scientific - between groups which have different and sometimes conflicting financial interests.</p> <p>When a contracting firm repairs a track, it \"takes possession\" of it. Trains are stopped for the duration of these \"track possessions\", and this may in itself cost Railtrack money if it cannot meet its obligations to the train operating companies, and their trains are cancelled or delayed. If a track possession overruns its scheduled time, however, the penalties are fiercer. Track work usually takes place at the weekend - but say something unexpected occurs, or the contractor has underestimated the time the repairs will take, and the track possession runs into Monday morning? There is a schedule with tariffs. Rates differ. A delay to a train in the London morning rush hour, for example, can cost Railtrack \u00a3200 a minute at Waterloo. One delayed train can cause other delayed trains for hundreds of miles down the track, with Railtrack compensating their operators for each. A bill of \u00a3250,000 is quite easy to run up. Railtrack, therefore, can penalise the contractor, gathering in money with one hand as it pays out with the other.</p> <p>Whatever emotion this system appeals to - fear, greed, blame, retribution - it is unlikely to inspire either trust or careful work manship. (Imagine the following sequence of events. A man working for a contractor on the line notices that a rail has some cracks. He consults his supervisor. His supervisor consults Railtrack. How long will the rail last? A track possession will delay trains and cost money. Can a repair be done quickly? Might it be postponed? Need it be done at all? Doesn't it suit the contractor to have the rail replaced at Railtrack's cost, via another contractor? A new rail will cost the maintenance contractor less to maintain. That, a suspicious Railtrack official might think, might lead the contractor to overestimate the damage. Which person, at what rank, will decide what must be done?)</p> <p>In July 1999, the government appointed a new rail regulator, Tom Winsor, a commercial lawyer. Winsor was determined to be tough. A month later a health and safety report (the railway safety statistics bulletin 1998-99) showed an alarming increase in the number of broken rails, up by 21% on the previous year-937 breakages against a Railtrack forecast of 600. On the same day, August 12, he wrote to Gerald Corbett at Railtrack demanding an \"action plan\". A fierce correspondence followed throughout the rest of the year and into 2000. Winsor accused Railtrack of lacking \"effective asset management\". When, on September 1 1999, Railtrack explained that the increase in broken rails was caused partly by \"rail nearing the end of its life in high-tonnage routes,\" Winsor replied that the spate of rail breaks \"does not seem to suggest that the rail was nearing life expiry, but that it was already at, or even beyond life expiry\" [his italics]. His letters demanded details of likely causes and proposed remedies. Winsor and the health and safety executive then looked abroad for expert and independent advice and commissioned an investigation from the transportation technology centre in Colorado into Railtrack's method of managing broken rails. The centre produced an extensive and highly critical report which attributed the breakages to a falling rate of rail renewals in the 1990s and a later increase in traffic, and recommended that Railtrack and its contractors should inspect and replace rails more often.</p> <p>It was published eight days after the Hatfield crash. When the American researchers completed their work, nobody had died because of a broken rail since 1967. But at the curve, 16 miles up the line from the bureaucratic anger in London, the rail had continued to crack as the letters went back and forth between Winsor and Corbett. Hour after hour, day after day, expresses rode over it at 115mph.</p> <p>Many people knew about this cracking rail. In November 1999, four years after it had been laid, workers for Balfour Beatty, the maintenance contractor, noticed early evidence of gauge corner cracking. Their superiors knew the rail would have to be replaced eventually - the question was when. Tiny cracks may grow quickly or slowly or might not grow at all. Balfour Beatty suggested to Railtrack that \"rail-grinding\" might be a temporary remedy, wearing down the surface of the rail by machine so that the cracks were ground out before they could grow. Rail-grinding, however, had been suspended soon after the railways were privatised. There was only one operational machine in the country. Nothing came of the idea at the time. Then, at a site meeting between Balfour Beatty and Railtrack in February 2000, a decision was made to replace the rail and Balfour Beatty was invited to bid for the job. Soon after, however, Railtrack decided that the work would go instead to Jarvis, the company which had the contract for track renewal as opposed to track maintenance. A 27-hour \"track possession\" was scheduled for March 19. But when that date came, the replacement rail had not arrived. According to John Ware, who investigated the crash for BBC's Panorama, there had been \"a cock-up in delivery\" which might have stemmed in part from the confusing management of the freight wagon carrying the new rails; it was owned by Railtrack but operated by men from Jarvis. Eventually, towards the end of April, the new rails were successfully delivered and laid by the trackside.</p> <p>A new problem arose: in March, Railtrack and Jarvis had a track-possession slot but no new rails, now they had rails but no new track-possession slot. Could one be arranged in May? The new and busier summer timetable of trains began in that month; closing a stretch of line would cause more inconvenience and delay than in March, and incur penalty payments on Railtrack. Jarvis (again according to Ware) said it would need five eight-hour possessions. Railtrack countered with the offer of two possessions, each lasting four hours and 20 minutes. Jarvis said that to do the work in that time was impossible. The re-railing was postponed until November, when Railtrack was again prepared to offer eight-hour possessions during the less crowded winter timetable. In September, a grinding-machine finally came and wore down the rail's surface, which might have been the wrong treatment at the wrong time. (Grinding is meant to stop cracks growing; if the cracks have already grown beneath the surface, some engineers believe grinding can make a cracked rail weaker.)</p> <p>In the meantime the rail continued to be inspected by Balfour Beatty, once a week by human eye (a man walking along the track), once every three months ultrasonically by a machine which is pushed by hand along the rail to scan its interior. This, for a high rail on a high-speed curve, was normal practice. The rail was scanned ultrasonically in April and again in July and by Railtrack's admission at least one of these scans was classified as unreadable. An unreadable ultrasonic scan suggests that either the cracking is so extensive that the machine can't register it, or that there is a fault in the machine. In either case, the rules suggest that a 20mph speed limit should automatically be imposed. Even without ultrasonic scanning, all the available evidence suggests that the Hatfield rail had been, or should have been, recognised as a most dangerous rail which demanded the imposition of a speed limit. When the rail was reassembled, it bore obvious signs of pre-crash metal distress. Apart from the cracking, its top surface had flaked up to a depth of three millimetres. A speed limit would have prevented four deaths.</p> <p>How much did Balfour Beatty and Jarvis tell Railtrack? What were Railtrack's instructions to Balfour Beatty? Who are the guilty men? As I write police investigations continue. Witnesses have been reluctant to be interviewed. There are filing cabinets of documents to be read. The evidence may support a criminal prosecution. The public mood, so far as one can tell, would like big fish in the net and a charge of corporate manslaughter. That is unlikely; as someone close to the Hatfield investigation said to me, you would need to find a piece of paper with such improbable words written on it as \"Do not repair this track, we can't afford it. Yrs sincerely, The Fat Controller.\" More likely is a charge of manslaughter - culpable homicide - against individuals lower down the ladder, or their prosecution for a breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act.</p> <p>The Hatfield crash arose from a quagmire of divided responsibility and incompetence, inspired by an ideology that placed adversarial money bargaining over human and technical cooperation, in which \"the contract\" was divine. Lawyers had bent their minds to the will of a government that wanted to raise as much cash as possible from the sale of public assets; and devised a scheme driven by the crudest and most unworkable notions of the free market and its competitive benefits.</p> <p>By the time of the Hatfield crash, the Labour government had had more than three years to abolish or modify the system that was so hastily and desperately devised by its Conservative predecessor. But its actions were mainly cosmetic. Government politicians said that Hatfield had created a new atmosphere within the industry, which now - at last - saw the need to \"pull together\", but it is difficult to find evidence to support this optimism. The world's most fragmented railway system has adversarial relationships at the heart of the philosophy which invented it, and an hour's frank conversation with most people who work in Britain's railways will eventually throw up \"mess\" as their most accurate description. Animosities exist at every level: between two government departments, the Treasury and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions; between two government agencies, the rail regulator and the strategic rail authority; between a third government agency, the health and safety executive, and many parts of the railway industry (the HSE was warning Railtrack about its \"weak\" management of contractors as early as March 1996); between Railtrack and the train operators; and between Railtrack and its contractors.</p> <p>A senior figure in the railways once told me a sad little story about the strategic rail authority, then still the shadow strategic rail authority.

      "bodyText": "My morning route to work in London takes me over a railway bridge. A traveller on the top deck of a bus at this point can see a junction and a single line curving off into a tunnel. Once there were two lines; once the curve was smooth. Sometime in the early 90s, however, I noticed that one of the lines had been taken up and that the curve was really a series of angled straight rails. Bill Armstrong, a former railway engineer, described this to me as \"a threepenny-bit curve\", after the old British 12-sided coin. The rails had probably been used elsewhere, or turned around at the same site, and wanted to assume their previous form, \"to go back,\" as he said, \"to where they lived before\". Also, around the same time, I began to notice weeds here and on other lines; weeds that grew on the ballast sometimes to the size of small shrubs. Even the busy track outside Waterloo terminus had them, with their suggestion of abandoned railways in the Argentinian pampas. I imagined that railways were obeying a new ecological stricture to ban herbicide. The cause was more straightforward. Between 1992 and 1997, the number of workers on Britain's railways fell from 159,000 to 92,000, at a time when the number of trains increased. Within these totals, the numbers of workers permanently employed to maintain and renew the infrastructure fell from 31,000 to between 15,000 and 19,000. In March 1998 the Guardian's transport editor, Keith Harper, interviewed a group of former British Rail workers. They spoke scathingly of the methods of their new employers, the private contractors who worked for Railtrack. One told him: \"At least 50% of the track is on its last legs. If it's not broken rails, it's broken components. If the public knew the full picture, it would be horrified. There are accidents waiting to happen and loads of speed restrictions. Some cowboy the other day forgot to put up a 20mph speed restriction on a 70mph route. How there wasn't an accident I'll never know.\" In November last year, attending a session of the government inquiry into the Ladbroke Grove rail crash before Lord Cullen, I heard the same situation on the track described in a more academic way. Professor Christopher Baldry, head of the department of management and organisation at Stirling University, was giving evidence about safety practices among rail workers, based on recent research. Baldry described the long and unregulated hours that could be worked under the negligent eye of a subcontractor, the lack of communication between train crews, signallers and rail maintenance workers all employed by different companies and often new to their jobs - and the rivalry between different contractors or subcontractors. \"We were given on several occasions evidence that if, for example, track workers from Scotland had been sent down to York to work on a bit of track that was unfamiliar to them, they find themselves working with other employees of a different contractor. Their instinct is to ask local people about the nature of the track. The local people may have been told by their employer, 'Don't talk to these persons because they are employed by the opposition.' \" Familiarity with the track had gone, old patterns of trust had been broken; the price of the competitive spirit. There could be so many different companies employed on the same stretch of line, Baldry said, that it would take \"a very brave person\" to halt the work because of a potential hazard. The system that Baldry mentioned was designed by commercial lawyers, in the legal belief that punishment works, and it involves confusing flows of money and paperwork through many \"interfaces\" - here the term is managerial rather than scientific - between groups which have different and sometimes conflicting financial interests. When a contracting firm repairs a track, it \"takes possession\" of it. Trains are stopped for the duration of these \"track possessions\", and this may in itself cost Railtrack money if it cannot meet its obligations to the train operating companies, and their trains are cancelled or delayed. If a track possession overruns its scheduled time, however, the penalties are fiercer. Track work usually takes place at the weekend - but say something unexpected occurs, or the contractor has underestimated the time the repairs will take, and the track possession runs into Monday morning? There is a schedule with tariffs. Rates differ. A delay to a train in the London morning rush hour, for example, can cost Railtrack \u00a3200 a minute at Waterloo. One delayed train can cause other delayed trains for hundreds of miles down the track, with Railtrack compensating their operators for each. A bill of \u00a3250,000 is quite easy to run up. Railtrack, therefore, can penalise the contractor, gathering in money with one hand as it pays out with the other. Whatever emotion this system appeals to - fear, greed, blame, retribution - it is unlikely to inspire either trust or careful work manship. (Imagine the following sequence of events. A man working for a contractor on the line notices that a rail has some cracks. He consults his supervisor. His supervisor consults Railtrack. How long will the rail last? A track possession will delay trains and cost money. Can a repair be done quickly? Might it be postponed? Need it be done at all? Doesn't it suit the contractor to have the rail replaced at Railtrack's cost, via another contractor? A new rail will cost the maintenance contractor less to maintain. That, a suspicious Railtrack official might think, might lead the contractor to overestimate the damage. Which person, at what rank, will decide what must be done?) In July 1999, the government appointed a new rail regulator, Tom Winsor, a commercial lawyer. Winsor was determined to be tough. A month later a health and safety report (the railway safety statistics bulletin 1998-99) showed an alarming increase in the number of broken rails, up by 21% on the previous year-937 breakages against a Railtrack forecast of 600. On the same day, August 12, he wrote to Gerald Corbett at Railtrack demanding an \"action plan\". A fierce correspondence followed throughout the rest of the year and into 2000. Winsor accused Railtrack of lacking \"effective asset management\". When, on September 1 1999, Railtrack explained that the increase in broken rails was caused partly by \"rail nearing the end of its life in high-tonnage routes,\" Winsor replied that the spate of rail breaks \"does not seem to suggest that the rail was nearing life expiry, but that it was already at, or even beyond life expiry\" [his italics]. His letters demanded details of likely causes and proposed remedies. Winsor and the health and safety executive then looked abroad for expert and independent advice and commissioned an investigation from the transportation technology centre in Colorado into Railtrack's method of managing broken rails. The centre produced an extensive and highly critical report which attributed the breakages to a falling rate of rail renewals in the 1990s and a later increase in traffic, and recommended that Railtrack and its contractors should inspect and replace rails more often. It was published eight days after the Hatfield crash. When the American researchers completed their work, nobody had died because of a broken rail since 1967. But at the curve, 16 miles up the line from the bureaucratic anger in London, the rail had continued to crack as the letters went back and forth between Winsor and Corbett. Hour after hour, day after day, expresses rode over it at 115mph. Many people knew about this cracking rail. In November 1999, four years after it had been laid, workers for Balfour Beatty, the maintenance contractor, noticed early evidence of gauge corner cracking. Their superiors knew the rail would have to be replaced eventually - the question was when. Tiny cracks may grow quickly or slowly or might not grow at all. Balfour Beatty suggested to Railtrack that \"rail-grinding\" might be a temporary remedy, wearing down the surface of the rail by machine so that the cracks were ground out before they could grow. Rail-grinding, however, had been suspended soon after the railways were privatised. There was only one operational machine in the country. Nothing came of the idea at the time. Then, at a site meeting between Balfour Beatty and Railtrack in February 2000, a decision was made to replace the rail and Balfour Beatty was invited to bid for the job. Soon after, however, Railtrack decided that the work would go instead to Jarvis, the company which had the contract for track renewal as opposed to track maintenance. A 27-hour \"track possession\" was scheduled for March 19. But when that date came, the replacement rail had not arrived. According to John Ware, who investigated the crash for BBC's Panorama, there had been \"a cock-up in delivery\" which might have stemmed in part from the confusing management of the freight wagon carrying the new rails; it was owned by Railtrack but operated by men from Jarvis. Eventually, towards the end of April, the new rails were successfully delivered and laid by the trackside. A new problem arose: in March, Railtrack and Jarvis had a track-possession slot but no new rails, now they had rails but no new track-possession slot. Could one be arranged in May? The new and busier summer timetable of trains began in that month; closing a stretch of line would cause more inconvenience and delay than in March, and incur penalty payments on Railtrack. Jarvis (again according to Ware) said it would need five eight-hour possessions. Railtrack countered with the offer of two possessions, each lasting four hours and 20 minutes. Jarvis said that to do the work in that time was impossible. The re-railing was postponed until November, when Railtrack was again prepared to offer eight-hour possessions during the less crowded winter timetable. In September, a grinding-machine finally came and wore down the rail's surface, which might have been the wrong treatment at the wrong time. (Grinding is meant to stop cracks growing; if the cracks have already grown beneath the surface, some engineers believe grinding can make a cracked rail weaker.) In the meantime the rail continued to be inspected by Balfour Beatty, once a week by human eye (a man walking along the track), once every three months ultrasonically by a machine which is pushed by hand along the rail to scan its interior. This, for a high rail on a high-speed curve, was normal practice. The rail was scanned ultrasonically in April and again in July and by Railtrack's admission at least one of these scans was classified as unreadable. An unreadable ultrasonic scan suggests that either the cracking is so extensive that the machine can't register it, or that there is a fault in the machine. In either case, the rules suggest that a 20mph speed limit should automatically be imposed. Even without ultrasonic scanning, all the available evidence suggests that the Hatfield rail had been, or should have been, recognised as a most dangerous rail which demanded the imposition of a speed limit. When the rail was reassembled, it bore obvious signs of pre-crash metal distress. Apart from the cracking, its top surface had flaked up to a depth of three millimetres. A speed limit would have prevented four deaths. How much did Balfour Beatty and Jarvis tell Railtrack? What were Railtrack's instructions to Balfour Beatty? Who are the guilty men? As I write police investigations continue. Witnesses have been reluctant to be interviewed. There are filing cabinets of documents to be read. The evidence may support a criminal prosecution.

That is unlikely; as someone close to the Hatfield investigation said to me, you would need to find a piece of paper with such improbable words written on it as \"Do not repair this track, we can't afford it. Yrs sincerely, The Fat Controller.\" More likely is a charge of manslaughter - culpable homicide - against individuals lower down the ladder, or their prosecution for a breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act. The Hatfield crash arose from a quagmire of divided responsibility and incompetence, inspired by an ideology that placed adversarial money bargaining over human and technical cooperation, in which \"the contract\" was divine. Lawyers had bent their minds to the will of a government that wanted to raise as much cash as possible from the sale of public assets; and devised a scheme driven by the crudest and most unworkable notions of the free market and its competitive benefits.

Broadcast in a primetime viewing position every Sunday night, the highbrow current affairs show has begun rushing through its reports on troubled events in Yugoslavia or Israel, and its analysis of political developments in Russia. This is to allow it to devote a large chunk of its two-hour slot to the internal problems unsettling the channel that airs it. Imagine an edition of Newsnight devoted to the future of the BBC, with Jeremy Paxman analysing his own career prospects in the event that the channel wound up its operation. Or think of Panorama dispatching its reporters to gather material for a report on the likelihood of the series being taken off the screen. Yet this is increasingly the tone of Itogi, presented by the highly-respected journalist Yevgeny Kiselyov, who is also the general director of NTV, the channel that broadcasts the programme. This week the navel-gazing extended to Kukly - Russia's version of Spitting Image. Political satire was abandoned in favour of more self-analysis, introducing a plastic puppet version of the Sunday news show, complete with a latex image of presenter Mr Kiselyov. With laboured symbolism, the script had the NTV studios on the verge of being destroyed by terrorist explosives, saved only by Russian president Vladimir Putin's rubber double, who stepped in at the last minute to defuse the ticking time bomb. This fascination with events at the headquarters of its own television station would be extremely tedious were it not for the issues apparently at stake. The future of NTV - Russia's only independent television network - in its current form has been in question now for almost a year and, later today, a decision at a boardroom meeting will determine whether key founding members of the staff will stay or be sacked. Senior executives from Media-Most - the media group that owns NTV - claim that the future of free speech in Russia depends on the decision. The complex twists of the Media-Most saga have become so tangled that the Russian public might have been forgiven for losing interest in its fate. But the tribulations of the network continue to attract attention and between 10,000 and 20,000 people turned out for a meeting in central Moscow on Saturday to protest at government-orchestrated attacks on the station. Rallied by a week of publicity in newspapers owned by Media-Most and on NTV's broadcasts, the protesters listened to a pop concert and heard liberal opposition politicians warning of the need to fight for press freedom. At the heart of the dispute is the Media-Most case - articulated by NTV's founder Vladimir Gusinsky - that the continuing government-initiated attempt to wrest back large loans from the company represents a deliberate attack on Russia's independent media. The Kremlin, Mr Gusinsky argues, was infuriated by NTV's coverage of the conflict in Chechnya and its criticism of Mr Putin's government, and is determined to stifle the station's dissenting voice. The Kremlin insists that this is a purely financial matter - Media-Most owes money, which must be repaid. Mr Gusinsky has also been charged with large-scale fraud in connection with the Media-Most empire. A meeting of shareholders has been called today by Alfred Kokh - the head of the media arm of the government-controlled natural gas giant Gazprom, which is owed debts of up to \u00a3210,641m by Media-Most. If the meeting goes ahead, Media-Most officials fear the session will initiate a vote for a new board of directors, which will result in the removal of their own staff members and their replacement with Kremlin-friendly substitutes. If these fears are realised, then today will prove a decisive landmark in the prolonged battle for control of the television network. Mr Gusinsky - who is under house-arrest in his villa in southern Spain, fighting an extradition request by Russian prosecutors - looks set to be ousted from the board of governors and has been doing his utmost to avert the board meeting. In the latest tortuous development, the High Court in London was due last week to rule on which side had the right to a contested block of 19% of crucial shares in Media-Most. The court decided that it was unable to make a ruling on the case. This meant that the shares remain frozen - and, ultimately, that Media-Most's 49% holding over NTV is reduced by 19%, giving Gazprom the decisive vote in questions of control (with 46% of the shares), thereby allowing them to replace influential figures like Mr Kiselyov as well as Mr Gusinsky. Also last week, Media-Most attempted, through a Russian court, to block Gazprom Media's decision to hold the extraordinary board meeting today; this legal action failed. Today, Mr Gusinsky and his team will be hoping that the Russian president echoes his puppet twin and steps in to avert the threat of NTV's destruction, but the chances of life imitating satire look slim.

      "bodyText": "A blueprint for Loaded, set out by new editor Keith Kendrick, has been sidelined in response to protests from journalists, who claim he wants to make the magazine more like FHM. The magazine's managing editor John Aldred is believed to have resigned in protest. A leaked copy of Mr Kendrick's \"vision\" for the magazine recommends a series of changes that insiders say go completely against the original spirit of the magazine. It is believed Mr Kendrick has already conceded some of his ideas may not be appropriate and has backtracked. But staff are still concerned by some of the suggestions. Mr Kendrick's original \"vision\" recommended journalists \"write (covers) in advance and features to fit\", and suggested the magazine's letters page should be dumped in favour of persuading \"friends and friends of friends\" to write in. He is also believed to have considered dropping the long-time Loaded columnists Stan Bowles and Howard Marks, the former marijuana dealer and author. In a planned section called Badge of Honour, Kendrick suggested a possible role model for Loaded man was a bloke who was robbed by a prostitute he was trying to \"pull\". A second role model was a man who \"to test his new camcorder, videoed himself masturbating\". He continued: \"Said video was then used to tape a christening and then the whole family were treated to a glimpse of some monkey-spanking action.\" For another new section idea, University of Life, the editor recommends features on \"what to do if a love rival chops your dick off\" and \"how to dump your girlfriend and make her feel grateful\". Mr Kendrick said the memo, leaked to MediaGuardian.co.uk, was an early brainstorm and did not represent a coherent strategy for the magazine. \"I am still going through the very long and meticulous process of deciding the way forward for Loaded,\" he explained. \"I've had two-hour-long meetings with each of my new team and their input has been incredible,\" he said. Mr Kendrick said the staff were \"fiercely passionate about their magazine and we are now meeting collectively to map out the way forward. \"Nothing will be decided about how to progress until I have been through this exhaustive consultation process.\" Insiders say they feel the changes will make Loaded less distinctive from other lads' mags. \"The signs are they want to squeeze FHM-style content through the 'Loaded filter',\" said one. \"The idea of doing 'ten ways to pull the wool over some poor girl's eyes and then dump her the next day' is against the spirit of what Loaded used to be about,\" the insider added. Loaded, which launched in 1993 under editor James Brown, was at the vanguard of lads' magazines. It was without an editor for almost a year after the departure in early 2000 of Tim Southwell, who left to join the now-defunct internet company Switch2. Mr Kendrick, who formerly edited Chat, was appointed in February and took the helm two weeks ago. Mr Brown, who is in the process of launching his own men's magazine, has recently spoken out against the men's sector, declaring it \"stale\" and \"pathetic\". Anger at the changes to Loaded came to a head at the IPC awards, when several members of staff walked out. Insiders say some journalists felt IPC's inability to nominate Loaded for any awards - despite the period of uncertainty it has undergone - represented a vote of no confidence from management. Mr Aldred was not available for comment. Related stories Feb 14: Perry quits Loaded Jan 24: IPC in talks with Perry over Loaded role",

The US is demanding that China return the crew and their EP-3E Aries II surveillance plane.</p> <p>The US ambassador to Beijing, Joseph Prueher, said earlier today that he believed Chinese officials had examined the spy plane, which is crammed with sophisticated surveillance equipment and is said to be the navy's most sophisticated eavesdropping aircraft.</p> <p>\"We are sure that the crew is not on the airplane and we have every reason to think that the Chinese have been all over the airplane,\" he told US breakfast television.</p> <p>Mr Prueher said that the US wants a diplomatic solution to the standoff but would offer no apology.</p> <p>He criticised \"these assertions ... from the [Chinese] foreign ministry and the message I have been getting for the last two nights as we have been talking to the Chinese, that the United States is to blame.</p> <p>\"The facts are, our aircraft was operating in international airspace and was on a routine surveillance mission when the collision occurred.\" As the standoff continued earlier today, the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, demanded an end to spy flights off China's coast and said the US was to blame for the collision between the surveillance plane and a Chinese jet fighter, a government spokesman said.</p> <p>\"The responsibility fully lies with the American side. We have full evidence for that,\" foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao quoted Mr Zemin as saying this morning.</p> <p>Beijing also claimed there had been little concern expressed from Washington about the fate of the Chinese pilot, who is still missing after he ejected over the sea.</p> <p>A senior US defence official said the spy plane's crew had said as it prepared for its emergency landing that it had begun destroying sensitive intelligence-collection equipment and information, in accordance with standard procedures.</p> <p>Mr Bangzao refused to say whether military officials had already boarded the plane and said that China had the right to investigate.</p> <p>Speaking at a news conference, Mr Bangzao questioned US assertions that the plane is protected American territory and cannot be boarded without US permission.</p> <p>\"The US airplane, without the authorisation of the Chinese side, illegally entered the Chinese airspace and landed on the Chinese airport,\" Mr Bangzao said. \"There is no question of immunity at all. Therefore, China has all rights to handle this case.\"</p> <p>Appearing to mock the American claim that the plane is protected, Mr Bangzao smiled and told reporters: \"If this plane is sovereign American territory, how did it land in China?</p> <p>\"Based on Chinese law and international practice, we have the right to conduct an investigation,\" he said.</p> <p>The US military argues its plane was on a routine surveillance mission in international air space.</p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/flash/0,7365,468031,00.html\">How did the crash happen?</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,467787,00.html\">03.04.2001: China refuses to bow to Bush over spy plane</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,467803,00.html\">03.04.2001, Isabel Hilton: In the jaws of the dragon</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,467790,00.html\">03.04.2001, leader: Coming down to earth</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/story/0,7369,466898,00.html\">02.04.2001: Crash widens China rift</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/story/0,7369,465807,00.html\"> 28.3.2001: Bush's foreign policy forays</a></p> <p><b>World dispatches</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,467951,00.html\">03.04.2001: John Gittings in Shanghai</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,467793,00.html\">03.04.2001: Julian Borger in Washington</a></p> <p><b>Special report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/\">Special report: George Bush's America</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee80fe0\">Should Bush make China America's number one enemy?</a></p> <p><b>Audio report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0402gittings.ra\">02.04.2001: US-Chinese relations take a chilly turn (2mins 39)</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/factfile/aircraft/air-ep3e.html\" target=\"_new\">US navy information on the plane</a><br><a href=\"www.pacom.mil/speeches/sst2001/010401blairplane.htm\" target=\"_new\">US pacific command information on the incident</a></p>",

The US ambassador to Beijing, Joseph Prueher, said earlier today that he believed Chinese officials had examined the spy plane, which is crammed with sophisticated surveillance equipment and is said to be the navy's most sophisticated eavesdropping aircraft. \"We are sure that the crew is not on the airplane and we have every reason to think that the Chinese have been all over the airplane,\" he told US breakfast television. Mr Prueher said that the US wants a diplomatic solution to the standoff but would offer no apology. He criticised \"these assertions ... from the [Chinese] foreign ministry and the message I have been getting for the last two nights as we have been talking to the Chinese, that the United States is to blame. \"The facts are, our aircraft was operating in international airspace and was on a routine surveillance mission when the collision occurred.\" As the standoff continued earlier today, the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, demanded an end to spy flights off China's coast and said the US was to blame for the collision between the surveillance plane and a Chinese jet fighter, a government spokesman said. \"The responsibility fully lies with the American side. We have full evidence for that,\" foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao quoted Mr Zemin as saying this morning. Beijing also claimed there had been little concern expressed from Washington about the fate of the Chinese pilot, who is still missing after he ejected over the sea. A senior US defence official said the spy plane's crew had said as it prepared for its emergency landing that it had begun destroying sensitive intelligence-collection equipment and information, in accordance with standard procedures. Mr Bangzao refused to say whether military officials had already boarded the plane and said that China had the right to investigate. Speaking at a news conference, Mr Bangzao questioned US assertions that the plane is protected American territory and cannot be boarded without US permission. \"The US airplane, without the authorisation of the Chinese side, illegally entered the Chinese airspace and landed on the Chinese airport,\" Mr Bangzao said. \"There is no question of immunity at all. Therefore, China has all rights to handle this case.\" Appearing to mock the American claim that the plane is protected, Mr Bangzao smiled and told reporters: \"If this plane is sovereign American territory, how did it land in China? \"Based on Chinese law and international practice, we have the right to conduct an investigation,\" he said. The US military argues its plane was on a routine surveillance mission in international air space. Interactive guide How did the crash happen?

      "bodyText": "First voyeuristic viewers were tempted with Castaway, then Big Brother and more recently Popstars. Now audiences are to be tempted with a real-life Blair Witch Project in which contestants are dumped in a secret \"haunted\" location and told to survive for 48 hours without the assistance of TV producers. The six will have to complete a series of night-time missions to determine if the site really is haunted. The group will record their experiences with hand-held cameras, giving the show the shaky-frame look of 1999 horror movie hit the Blair Witch Project. There is no film or other production crew present, only remotely controlled surveillance cameras. The show, called Fear, is currently running on MTV in America but executives from Mentorn TV are bringing the format to the UK. It is understood they are in talks with several broadcasters including Channel 4 and Channel 5. Mentorn, the Television Corportion subsidiary that makes BBC2 show Robot Wars, is also producing a new paintballing show, Crossfire, for Channel 4. The US version of Fear, which has already gone out on MTV in the UK, was shot in locations including a deserted prison, a haunted house and a derelict military academy. In the meantime Channel 4 has asked Mentorn to make a 13-part series of Crossfire. \"It's a paintballing war game show,\" said Mentorn International managing director Mark Rowland. \"Crossfire is Videogames meets Austin Powers. Every week the contestants have to save the world, with a mix of ingeniuty and paint ball guns.\" The outfit has also just sold the Robot Wars format to Screentime, the Australian production company behind the Popstars format. Mentorn and Screentime will co-produce the Australian version of the cult show, which has also recently been sold to Viacom in the US.

Allegations made against British nationals will be tried in British courts.</p> <p>The definitions of war crimes in the statute are already reflected in international law and binding on our armed forces. They are part of the well-established law of armed conflict. They are rules which any self-respecting country applies and enforces as part of the discipline and professionalism of its armed forces. And they form part of the basic training of every British army officer.</p> <p>Today we have the chance to send a clear message to the world's tyrants that they cannot escape justice, and a signal to the world that Britain is a country which stands up for the oppressed, for human rights and for the rule of law.

Our negotiators played an important role in ensuring the crimes would cover internal armed conflict, would include rape and forced recruitment of child soldiers as war crimes, and would provide reparations for victims. The Rome statute represents the overwhelming determination of the international community to see justice done. In Rome, 120 countries voted for the statute and only seven against. And before the deadline for signature of December 31 2000 even more countries - 139 - had signed. Twenty-nine have ratified to date, including a significant number of Nato allies. The United States has signed the statute, and shares our determination to carry forward the global fight against war crimes. I hope that with time the US will join its closest ally in ratifying the statute as well and will come to see that its concerns are misplaced. Concerns about a risk to UK servicemen are based on a misunderstanding. There are safeguards to make sure the court will not proceed with allegations when they are made in bad faith. The ICC will step in only when states are unwilling or unable to investigate. We intend to be both willing and able to demonstrate that there is a remedy in British justice for accusations made against our servicemen. Allegations made against British nationals will be tried in British courts. The definitions of war crimes in the statute are already reflected in international law and binding on our armed forces. They are part of the well-established law of armed conflict. They are rules which any self-respecting country applies and enforces as part of the discipline and professionalism of its armed forces. And they form part of the basic training of every British army officer. Today we have the chance to send a clear message to the world's tyrants that they cannot escape justice, and a signal to the world that Britain is a country which stands up for the oppressed, for human rights and for the rule of law. I hope that all sides of the House of Commons will feel able to back the bill. We all have a responsibility to make sure the world does not provide any opening for another Milosevic. \u0095 Robin Cook is the foreign secretary comment@theguardian.com",

Most of the differences are based on the pace of change, for example the speed at which remaining council housing is transferred or the extent of remedies available against anti-social tenants. But important differences remain on pushing home ownership for council tenants and blurring the distinction between the private and social landlord sectors. \u0095 This is an edited extract of a report for the Housing Quality Network.",

But a sufficient number of the selections for the key seats, those that might change hands, have been made for us to establish what the propor tion of women is likely to be in the new house.</p> <p>The next general election will be fought largely between the Conservatives on the one hand, and Labour and the Liberal Democrats on the other. This configuration of the political battleground might surprise: both Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats are, after all, in opposition to the Blair government. The present polarisation between the Conservatives and the other two main parties reflects the legacy of the 1997 general election. To win office, the Conservatives will have to capture at least 165 seats; Labour and the Liberal Democrats hold most of these. In 1997, Labour won only a couple of seats from the Liberals. At present the party holds only a handful of Liberal Democrat targets. For some of these, moreover, the Liberal Democrats are in third place.</p> <p>Given their strong showing in 1997, neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats are likely to capture many seats. For both, the election will be an exercise in damage limitation. The number of seats won by the Conservative party will, therefore, determine the gender composition of the new parliament. In the chart, each point on the x axis gives a likely snapshot of the proportion of women members for the main parties and for the House of Commons overall in the event of the Conservatives recapturing that number of seats. The projection assumes a uniform swing.</p> <p>The pattern of selections to replace retiring MPs means that in the event of the Conservatives failing to win a single seat the next parliament would have around five fewer women members than in 1997, a proportion of 17.5%. Thereafter, our projection indicates, the percentage of women in the House of Commons falls as the size of any swing to the Conservatives increases. By the time Labour lost its majority, the proportion of women at Westminster would be down to around 15.5%. Should William Hague win an overall majority, that proportion would be less than 15%. At no point does the next parliament match the level set in 1997 of 18.2%.</p> <p>The chart also gives projections for the main parties. In 1997, women made up 24.2% of the parliamentary Labour party. Given the failure to select women, the proportion of women MPs and candidates in Labour-held seats is now around 23.4%. Many of the women selected by Labour before the 1997 general election were chosen either for target seats or for those already held by the party; the unexpected size of victory did not contribute greatly to the number of women in the PLP. Accordingly, Labour can lose a number of seats without the proportion of women in the PLP changing greatly. Indeed, the distribution between men and women is such that, if the Tories win between 55 and 85 seats, the gender balance of the PLP would improve slightly on that attained in 1997. Thereafter, however, it would decline: by the time the Conservatives won a majority, it could be under 20%.</p> <p>The declining number of women Labour MPs will be partially offset by a rise in Conservative ones. In 1997, women made up less than 8% of the Conservative presence in parliament. At the next election, given the pattern of selections, a small number of gains by the party would improve that figure. The improvement would, however, be slight: by the time William Hague won his majority, women would make up around 11.5% of Conservative MPs.</p> <p>The increasing number of Conservative women in parliament will not offset the loss of Labour and Liberal Democratic women. The Liberal Democrats' performance is especially disappointing. They start from a poor position, with only three women MPs out of 47. As the swing to the Conservatives increases, so Liberal Democrat women MPs become more vulnerable. A swing of just over 5% would see two MPs, Jackie Ballard in Taunton and Jenny Tonge in Richmond Park, lose their seats. The remaining female Liberal Democrat MP, Sandra Gidley, took Romsey from the Conservatives at a byelection in 2000 and is also vulnerable. The Liberal Democrats may well come out of the election without a female MP.</p> <p>Overall, the failure to build on the advances made in May 1997 is manifest. Of the 170 or so contests which will largely determine the next government, more than 100, around 60%, are between men. In these constituencies both the sitting candidate and the most plausible challenger are male. By contrast, in just six of these seats is it possible that a woman will capture a seat from a woman MP (or a female inheritor). For those who claimed that 1997 marked a breakthrough in the political representation of women, our projection provides a bleak picture.</p> <p>Judith Squires and Mark Wickham-Jones are at the University of Bristol.

      "body": "<p>The government's opinion poll lead over the Conservatives has surged six points to give Tony Blair a commanding lead of 15 points despite growing discontent over its handling of the foot and mouth crisis, according to a Guardian/ICM poll published today.</p> <p>The ranks of those who disapprove of the way ministers have dealt with the epidemic have grown sharply in the last fortnight by 10 points to 56%. Only 29% are now willing to say they approve of the way it has been handled.</p> <p>The prime minister's decision to delay local elections until June 7 - which he confirmed yesterday, making it more than likely that the general election will be held on the same day - receives strong backing in the survey. The opinion poll reveals that one in three Labour voters would have liked him to delay even longer.</p> <p>But Mr Blair yesterday went out of his way to repeatedly stress that he will not \"indefinitely suspend the democratic process\" beyond June 7. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street, he said: \"This is a decision that has to be taken in the interests of the whole country, the parts that don't support the government as well as the parts that do. It is time to unify, not divide, to work together to help the communities most affected.</p> <p>\"Whilst this is going on, I believe it would not be appropriate to hold these elections on May 3.</p> <p>\"But equally we cannot, should not, and will not indefinitely suspend the democratic process. A short postponement for the reasons I have given is one thing. An indefinite delay is quite another.\"</p> <p>The six-point surge in Labour's share of the vote compared with the last Guardian/ICM poll a fortnight ago gives Mr Blair a 49% share of the vote. It also confirms that the Conservatives have so far failed to reap any political benefit from the foot and mouth crisis. The Tory party is down one point to 34%, suggesting that it is the lack of any credible alternative which underpins Labour's large lead.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats appears to have been the party hardest hit by the crisis, with a three point drop in its share of the vote to 13% which could see its ranks at Westminster cut from 47 to only 20, particularly in their rural strongholds in the south west, mid-Wales and the Scottish borders.</p> <p>The ICM poll \"variometer\", which takes account of regional swing, indicates that on these voting shares Labour would be returned with an overall majority of around 150, just 30 seats short of its current Commons majority.</p> <p>The poll suggests that Mr Blair would have paid a significant price - cutting his lead by a full four points, worth perhaps 25 seats - if he had pushed ahead with a May 3 general election.</p> <p>The poll, which was carried out on Friday and Saturday, shows that while Mr Blair may have overruled his cabinet and his party in opting for a June general election date, it is very popular among Labour voters. Only 28% of Labour voters say they wanted to see a May election, with 34% picking June and some 30% saying they wanted the election to be held later in the year. Among all voters only 17% backed a May election and 27% the June option. Some 45% wanted it delayed until later in the year.</p> <p>The lack of a credible alternative is underlined by the politicians' personal ratings. While 85% of Labour voters said they thought Mr Blair would make the best prime minister, only 60% of Tory voters believe William Hague would be best at the job. Among Liberal Democrats only 30% picked Charles Kennedy.</p> <p>Mr Blair's decision to delay the elections was broadly welcomed, with most ministers and backbenchers backing what they admitted was a difficult judgment call.</p> <p>\"This is about sentiment, psychology and sensitivity, so better a sweet victory in June than a sour one in May,\" conceded one Millbank veteran.</p> <p>The prime minister refused to discuss a general election date, but said contests scheduled for 11 unitary authorities and all county councils in England for May 3 would now be postponed until June 7.</p> <p>All council by-elections scheduled for May 3 or later, and the Northern Ireland district council elections scheduled for May 16, will also be postponed to June 7, Jack Straw, the home secretary, told MPs.</p> <p>Mr Blair has concluded that the harmful signals which the five-week delay may have on the tourist trade is more than offset by the need to concentrate efforts on getting the crisis under control. There is still no decision on whether or not to vaccinate animals.</p> <p>Mr Hague welcomed the delay but demanded that it be indefinite because the crisis is unlikely to be resolved by June. \"We have already seen over the last six weeks or so that the government don't know, none of us know, how the foot and mouth crisis will develop,\" he said.</p> <p>Farmers were divided, as were union leaders, some of whom fear Mr Blair is in dan ger of being bounced into the perils of an October poll.</p> <p>ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,000 adults aged over 18 by telephone between March 29-30 2001. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a

The ranks of those who disapprove of the way ministers have dealt with the epidemic have grown sharply in the last fortnight by 10 points to 56%. Only 29% are now willing to say they approve of the way it has been handled. The prime minister's decision to delay local elections until June 7 - which he confirmed yesterday, making it more than likely that the general election will be held on the same day - receives strong backing in the survey. The opinion poll reveals that one in three Labour voters would have liked him to delay even longer. But Mr Blair yesterday went out of his way to repeatedly stress that he will not \"indefinitely suspend the democratic process\" beyond June 7. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street, he said: \"This is a decision that has to be taken in the interests of the whole country, the parts that don't support the government as well as the parts that do. It is time to unify, not divide, to work together to help the communities most affected. \"Whilst this is going on, I believe it would not be appropriate to hold these elections on May 3. \"But equally we cannot, should not, and will not indefinitely suspend the democratic process. A short postponement for the reasons I have given is one thing. An indefinite delay is quite another.\" The six-point surge in Labour's share of the vote compared with the last Guardian/ICM poll a fortnight ago gives Mr Blair a 49% share of the vote. It also confirms that the Conservatives have so far failed to reap any political benefit from the foot and mouth crisis. The Tory party is down one point to 34%, suggesting that it is the lack of any credible alternative which underpins Labour's large lead. The Liberal Democrats appears to have been the party hardest hit by the crisis, with a three point drop in its share of the vote to 13% which could see its ranks at Westminster cut from 47 to only 20, particularly in their rural strongholds in the south west, mid-Wales and the Scottish borders. The ICM poll \"variometer\", which takes account of regional swing, indicates that on these voting shares Labour would be returned with an overall majority of around 150, just 30 seats short of its current Commons majority. The poll suggests that Mr Blair would have paid a significant price - cutting his lead by a full four points, worth perhaps 25 seats - if he had pushed ahead with a May 3 general election. The poll, which was carried out on Friday and Saturday, shows that while Mr Blair may have overruled his cabinet and his party in opting for a June general election date, it is very popular among Labour voters. Only 28% of Labour voters say they wanted to see a May election, with 34% picking June and some 30% saying they wanted the election to be held later in the year. Among all voters only 17% backed a May election and 27% the June option. Some 45% wanted it delayed until later in the year. The lack of a credible alternative is underlined by the politicians' personal ratings. While 85% of Labour voters said they thought Mr Blair would make the best prime minister, only 60% of Tory voters believe William Hague would be best at the job. Among Liberal Democrats only 30% picked Charles Kennedy. Mr Blair's decision to delay the elections was broadly welcomed, with most ministers and backbenchers backing what they admitted was a difficult judgment call. \"This is about sentiment, psychology and sensitivity, so better a sweet victory in June than a sour one in May,\" conceded one Millbank veteran. The prime minister refused to discuss a general election date, but said contests scheduled for 11 unitary authorities and all county councils in England for May 3 would now be postponed until June 7. All council by-elections scheduled for May 3 or later, and the Northern Ireland district council elections scheduled for May 16, will also be postponed to June 7, Jack Straw, the home secretary, told MPs. Mr Blair has concluded that the harmful signals which the five-week delay may have on the tourist trade is more than offset by the need to concentrate efforts on getting the crisis under control. There is still no decision on whether or not to vaccinate animals. Mr Hague welcomed the delay but demanded that it be indefinite because the crisis is unlikely to be resolved by June. \"We have already seen over the last six weeks or so that the government don't know, none of us know, how the foot and mouth crisis will develop,\" he said. Farmers were divided, as were union leaders, some of whom fear Mr Blair is in dan ger of being bounced into the perils of an October poll. ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,000 adults aged over 18 by telephone between March 29-30 2001. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.

We are looking for the hidden Tom Joneses, the pop stars who may have been overlooked because of the obsession with boy bands.\" </p> <p>Many of those who applied had tried to pursue careers in music in their youth, but the publicist denied the band would comprise a bunch of failures. \"Unfortunately, just being talented isn't enough in an industry that's imitative rather than innovative,\" he said. </p> <p>Successful band members could be as old as 70, but he is adamant there will be no pipe and slippers image. </p> <p>\"We're going to appeal to the same sort of market as Tom Jones - from those in their twenties upwards - and those we choose will have the same sort of sex appeal as him or as Mick Jagger. They're going to have that indefinable quality that makes them stand out.\" </p> <p>Some in the music industry were less than enthusiastic. </p> <p>\"I think it's a terrible idea,\" said Smash Hits acting editor John Hindmarch. \"The reason boy bands do so well is because the age group they appeal to are the ones that buy the records. This sounds like a novelty thing, a PR stunt.\" </p> <p>Paul Trynka, editor of Mojo, said: \"The idea of manufacturing a band of 50-year-olds is bizarre. The whole point of boy bands is that they're 19 and 20-year-olds straight out of stage school who haven't had their chance to make a mark but here you'll have five failed 50-year-olds. </p> <p>\"Obviously if someone can get a huge amount of free publicity, as Hear'Say did with Popstars, it might have an effect. But younger fans are quite happy with bands that are fresh and by the time most people are in their fifties their musical tastes are more sophisticated than pop so I can't see them going for them. </p> <p>\"It's great that this is going against the normal trend of ageism, but I can't help thinking genuine mature talent and the idea of a manufactured band aren't very good bedfellows.\"</p>",

The criteria are simple: they must possess \"real musical ability\" and, in a riposte to the cult of youth, they must be at least 50. With the successful five due to be filmed for a Popstars style documentary, and rival record companies apparently primed to battle for the more mature ensemble, Mr Nkwocha is convinced Man-Band will fill an untapped niche in the ruthlessly competitive mainstream pop market. \"At the moment you can only buy what you're offered by the record companies and all that is a constant stream of Boyzones and Westlifes, bands which are quickly forgotten,\" he said. \"What we're doing is investing in people with genuine ability, genuine talent and experience. We are looking for the hidden Tom Joneses, the pop stars who may have been overlooked because of the obsession with boy bands.\" Many of those who applied had tried to pursue careers in music in their youth, but the publicist denied the band would comprise a bunch of failures. \"Unfortunately, just being talented isn't enough in an industry that's imitative rather than innovative,\" he said. Successful band members could be as old as 70, but he is adamant there will be no pipe and slippers image. \"We're going to appeal to the same sort of market as Tom Jones - from those in their twenties upwards - and those we choose will have the same sort of sex appeal as him or as Mick Jagger. They're going to have that indefinable quality that makes them stand out.\" Some in the music industry were less than enthusiastic. \"I think it's a terrible idea,\" said Smash Hits acting editor John Hindmarch. \"The reason boy bands do so well is because the age group they appeal to are the ones that buy the records. This sounds like a novelty thing, a PR stunt.\" Paul Trynka, editor of Mojo, said: \"The idea of manufacturing a band of 50-year-olds is bizarre. The whole point of boy bands is that they're 19 and 20-year-olds straight out of stage school who haven't had their chance to make a mark but here you'll have five failed 50-year-olds. \"Obviously if someone can get a huge amount of free publicity, as Hear'Say did with Popstars, it might have an effect. But younger fans are quite happy with bands that are fresh and by the time most people are in their fifties their musical tastes are more sophisticated than pop so I can't see them going for them. \"It's great that this is going against the normal trend of ageism, but I can't help thinking genuine mature talent and the idea of a manufactured band aren't very good bedfellows.\"",

      "body": "<p>Perhaps the most startling finding in this Guardian/ICM opinion poll is how little the Conservatives have benefited politically from the foot and mouth crisis.</p> <p>The one point drop in the Conservative share of the vote to 34% compared with a similar Guardian/ICM poll a fortnight ago suggests that whatever the voters think about Labour's handling of the foot and mouth crisis, William Hague's Conservative party is not seen as a viable alternative. This is reflected in the fact that only 60% of Tory voters name Mr Hague for their choice of prime minister.</p> <p>At first sight the 15 point lead for Labour may seem to be out of line with recent ICM polls. But Labour enjoyed a similar lead in February before the crisis really began to bite. Tony Blair's lead dropped to 9 points in the third week of March when a majority of voters were also saying he should delay the election.</p> <p>About half of the people polled in this ICM survey were telephoned on Saturday and Sunday when the radio and television were already pumping out the message that Mr Blair was believed to have decided to delay until June.</p> <p>It may be that while they didn't necessarily approve of the way the epidemic had been handled, the government was seen to respond to the most important demand, ie that the election be delayed.</p> <p>For the Liberal Democrats, who had not fallen below the 15% mark since October 1997, the poll marks particularly dismal reading. On ICM's \"variometer\" which takes account of regional swing the Liberal Democrats' band of 47 MPs would be reduced to only 20 on this showing.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps the most startling finding in this Guardian/ICM opinion poll is how little the Conservatives have benefited politically from the foot and mouth crisis. The one point drop in the Conservative share of the vote to 34% compared with a similar Guardian/ICM poll a fortnight ago suggests that whatever the voters think about Labour's handling of the foot and mouth crisis, William Hague's Conservative party is not seen as a viable alternative. This is reflected in the fact that only 60% of Tory voters name Mr Hague for their choice of prime minister. At first sight the 15 point lead for Labour may seem to be out of line with recent ICM polls. But Labour enjoyed a similar lead in February before the crisis really began to bite. Tony Blair's lead dropped to 9 points in the third week of March when a majority of voters were also saying he should delay the election. About half of the people polled in this ICM survey were telephoned on Saturday and Sunday when the radio and television were already pumping out the message that Mr Blair was believed to have decided to delay until June. It may be that while they didn't necessarily approve of the way the epidemic had been handled, the government was seen to respond to the most important demand, ie that the election be delayed. For the Liberal Democrats, who had not fallen below the 15% mark since October 1997, the poll marks particularly dismal reading. On ICM's \"variometer\" which takes account of regional swing the Liberal Democrats' band of 47 MPs would be reduced to only 20 on this showing. Many Lib Dem seats are concentrated in areas most affected by the foot and mouth epidemic such as the south west, mid-Wales and the Scottish borders. The fact that only 30% of Liberal Democrat voters see Charles Kennedy as making the best prime minister and 24% of them think Tony Blair does a better job may reflect the low profile of the party during the last fortnight. What if Tony Blair had pressed ahead and announced yesterday that the election was going to be on May 3?

      "bodyText": "Perhaps the most startling finding in this Guardian/ICM opinion poll is how little the Conservatives have benefited politically from the foot and mouth crisis. The one point drop in the Conservative share of the vote to 34% compared with a similar Guardian/ICM poll a fortnight ago suggests that whatever the voters think about Labour's handling of the foot and mouth crisis, William Hague's Conservative party is not seen as a viable alternative. This is reflected in the fact that only 60% of Tory voters name Mr Hague for their choice of prime minister. At first sight the 15 point lead for Labour may seem to be out of line with recent ICM polls. But Labour enjoyed a similar lead in February before the crisis really began to bite. Tony Blair's lead dropped to 9 points in the third week of March when a majority of voters were also saying he should delay the election. About half of the people polled in this ICM survey were telephoned on Saturday and Sunday when the radio and television were already pumping out the message that Mr Blair was believed to have decided to delay until June. It may be that while they didn't necessarily approve of the way the epidemic had been handled, the government was seen to respond to the most important demand, ie that the election be delayed. For the Liberal Democrats, who had not fallen below the 15% mark since October 1997, the poll marks particularly dismal reading. On ICM's \"variometer\" which takes account of regional swing the Liberal Democrats' band of 47 MPs would be reduced to only 20 on this showing. Many Lib Dem seats are concentrated in areas most affected by the foot and mouth epidemic such as the south west, mid-Wales and the Scottish borders. The fact that only 30% of Liberal Democrat voters see Charles Kennedy as making the best prime minister and 24% of them think Tony Blair does a better job may reflect the low profile of the party during the last fortnight. What if Tony Blair had pressed ahead and announced yesterday that the election was going to be on May 3? The poll shows that some 9% of Labour voters would probably have decided not to vote for the party. The indications from the poll is that the price that Mr Blair would have paid for appearing so callous to the farmers would have been somewhere in the region of four points off his lead, putting Labour on 46% and the Conservatives on 35% - a difference of about 20 to 25 seats. \u0095 ICM interviewed a random sample of adults aged over 18 by telephone between March 29-30, 2001. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.

      "bodyText": "Many donors who have secretly bankrolled Labour and the Conservatives to the tune of \u00a328m for the coming campaign will be named on May 2 in advance of the deferred election. The electoral commission - the body set up to monitor party donations and campaign spending - has decided to go ahead with plans to publish at the beginning of May all donations received between mid-February and April 30. If the election had been held on May 3 the public would have been told a day before polling who had bankrolled whom. Now for the first time most of the major donors will be revealed before the election campaign begins. Under the rules any national donation totalling \u00a35,000 or more in cash or kind will be published plus any donation above \u00a31,000 given to a local constituency party. The donor's name and amount will be released. A number of prominent millionaire donors such as Lord Sainsbury, publishers Christopher Ondaatje and Lord Hamlyn, who backed Labour to the tune of \u00a32m each and Stuart Wheeler, owner of the IG Index, the spread betting firm, who has given \u00a35m to the Conservatives, declared earlier this year. They form only a small part of the donations made to the parties. Ironically a decision to hold a general election on June 7 will mean that donors wanting to avoid scrutiny until the end of August could give money between May 1 and May 13 and not have to declare the cash immediately. The disclosure of weekly donations during the campaign will not begin until May 22, since this campaign provision cannot be implemented until Mr Blair announces the disolution of parliament, widely expected now on May 14.

It is understood it paid \u00a3100,000 to buy the name from an executive who had registered the name in 1994. The deal, sealed at the weekend, means ITV can press ahead with its global dot.com strategy. The network\\s inability to use the domain name had became something of an embarrassment for ITV executives, who could talk about ITV.com but didn't have any rights over the name. Granada Media bought the domain name from Nick Rosen, director of the Online Research Agency. He had planned to develop the site into an interactive TV website before he was approached by Granada Media last year. Justin Judd, online controller for Granada Broadband, refused to confirm how much ITV had paid, but said it had been a \"reasonable price\". Asked why there was now nothing on ITV.com, he said: \"We're considering the next step now and are thrashing out the global strategic direction with ITV partners.\" Mr Judd hinted that ITV.com would have different content and a different strategy from the existing ITV website, ITV.co.uk, which launched its first Who Wants to be a Millionaire? online game today. Granada Media and Carlton Communications, the two largest ITV companies, have, until now, pursued their own disparate internet strategies. Tthey decided last year that in order to compete on the global stage and take on the likes of bbc.co.uk, they would have to bury the hatchet and work together in ITV's common interest. Now they own ITV.com, Carlton and Granada will be able to develop a single, focused ITV website to give them more clout. Granada and Carlton's internet strategies have so far received muted reactions. Carlton developed a number of strong web brands - Jamba, Popcorn and SimplyFood - but has since moved SimplyFood into Taste.co.uk, its joint venture with Sainbury's, and focused more on Carlton.com. Granada went cold on G-wizz almost immediately following its launch, and finally shut it down last week.",

      "body": "<p>This year, as every year, the New York Times listed its critics' choices of the films and directors that should have been in the running for an Oscar. Two of the three nominations were for Edward Yang and his film A One and a Two (Yi Yi). Few people who have seen the film would question those nominations. The New York Times found it \"sublime\", the LA Weekly described it as \"a quiet masterpiece of emotion\" and when it was shown recently in cinemas in LA people burst into applause at the end. </p> <p>A One and a Two is the story of a Taiwanese family experiencing the punctuation marks of life from birth to marriage to death. It deals with romance and rejection, jealousy and disappointment, optimism and alienation. Central to the film is a dying grandmother, whom the family have been encouraged to talk to even though it is not clear if she can understand what they are saying, and a small boy who likes to take photographs of the backs of people's heads so they can see the half of life they normally miss. </p> <p>This is Yang's seventh film but the first to have a proper international film release and the one that may finally bring his work to wider audience. Born in China in 1947, Yang moved with his family to Taiwan as a child and was fortunate that his father was a film buff. \"My dad grew up in Shanghai and loved to go to the movies,\" says Yang, a self-effacing man, sitting in a Beverly Hills coffee bar. \"It was quite expensive and unusual, so every time I went I would tell my schoolfriends what I had seen and then I started to draw the films so that more people could see them. After that, I started to make up sequels and my own stories.\" </p> <p>At the time Yang was growing up, Taiwan was anxious to forge good diplomatic relations and would distribute the kind of European films that might not oth erwise have been seen there. \"I remember I went with my sister to [Federico Fellini's] 8, and only she and I and two bar-girls were there. The two bar-girls would keep complaining and saying, 'I can't understand the story.' We were lucky - Robert Bresson's films were commercially released in Taiwan, too. None of my French friends believe me when I tell them.\" </p> <p>As a young man, Yang moved to the US to study electrical engineering at the University of Florida. His fascination with cinema took him to the University of Southern California to study film. But he dropped out and worked in computer design for the next seven years. \"I had given up and said, 'I am not built for becoming a film-maker,' until one night when I was driving downtown in Seattle and saw this sign outside a cinema saying 'German New Wave: Aguirre, the Wrath of God' [the 1972 Werner Herzog film]. I went in and that turned me around.\" </p> <p>He decided there and then that he had to, as they would say in Hollywood, pursue his dream. \"I was telling this story later to a friend in San Francisco during the film festival there and my friend said 'Turn around' and there was Werner Herzog. We became good friends.\" </p> <p>A friend from film school had already started to direct in Taiwan and knew that Yang had a lot of stories from the days when they drew comic books together. Yang returned to his home territory and gave up computers for ever. \"Mum was really up set,\" he smiles, \"but it was something I really wanted to do.\" </p> <p>After working in television for a while, he made his own films. That Day, on the Beach (1983), Taipei Story (1985) and The Terroriser (1986) all won him critical admiration but his breakthrough came in 1991 with A Brighter Summer Day. Set in the 1960s, with a cold war backdrop, the four-hour film told the story of a teenager who falls in love with the girlfriend of a gang leader. Two satires, A Confucian Confusion (1994) and Mahjong (1996), followed. In the meantime his compatriot Hou Hsiao-Hsien had also been carving his own niche, making Cute Girl in 1980 and winning the critics' award at the 1986 Berlin festival for The Time to Live and the Time to Die (1985). </p> <p>Did they see themselves as part of a movement, a Taiwanese New Wave? \"In the beginning, it was a collective effort. Our generation was taking over and there was a new, more energetic kind of film-making. But after we made a name for ourselves we had different directions to go in, and in the last 10 years it has been pretty much individual efforts.\" </p> <p>A One and a Two has been in gestation for more than a decade, its origins lying in a friend's dying relative. He was in a coma but the doctors felt he might benefit if people addressed him as if he could understand everything. \"It was quite overwhelming to me to talk to the person pretending he's normal. In that kind of situation you have to be very honest not just to him but to yourself. That was in the 1980s but I knew I was too young to make the film then.\" Yang was then in his late 30s. \"I let it sit in my head so that all the details came in and settled, and when I finally proposed the story [to the film's Japanese backers] two years ago, I felt I was ready.\" </p> <p>One of the film's most memorable parts involves the obser vations of the small boy, played unselfconsciously by Jonathan Chang. \"I didn't think that much about that part over the years. Most of the details developed during the writing because basically that character is the foundation of all the other characters, someone we all once were. Most of the people I talk to share similar feelings, whether they are men or women. I think we were all once that way, with all kinds of questions, and we didn't know which one was more philosophical than the other because we didn't have answers to any of them.\" </p> <p>Yang gives credit to his largely unknown cast for the success of the film. \"The writing doesn't stop at the script; that's a blueprint. There is still room with actors to accommodate their strengths and avoid their weaknesses. It's like a building - it has to be built under one concept or it doesn't work. Taiwan does not have a big pool of actors, and Jonathan was only seven at the time and I was looking for a 10-year-old. But he caught my casting director's eye and he said, 'Take a look at this kid.' I said 'Gee!' I was worried whether he would understand the things I would ask him to do but he was so smart.\" </p> <p>While Yang's work has always found a responsive audience in Taipei, Europe was the first territory overseas to welcome it. \"The London Film Festival in 1983 was the first moment that Taiwan's new cinema got a chance to be exposed to the world. I did one segment of a film done by four young film-makers that was invited to the festival and I hand-carried the tapes to London . . . After that, I think people realised what was happening and Derek Malcolm [the Guardian's film critic at the time] came to Taipei.\" </p> <p>Japan followed suit. But it took years before the west was prepared to give proper releases to Asian films that were not exclusively concerned with martial arts. The success of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Wong Kar-Wai's In the Mood for Love may push the doors wider open. </p> <p>Yang is interested in exploring the world that the new technologies have created. \"We have more and more things in common than in the past, especially in the cities. In the last 10 years, I [have become] more familiar with the streets of Tokyo and Hong Kong and some parts of Paris and LA than the rural areas of my own country.\" He has finished a script about \"a young kid who travels the world with just a cellphone and a credit card. Those two things are all you need now. It's a new world and there are a lot of stories we can tell each other.\" </p> <p>The success of A One and a Two has already led to new offers. \"I feel like an athlete - all these clubs seeing if you would like to join the team. There are new possibilities but I think it depends on whether my style fits into their game - and if it does, it's wonderful.\" There had been approaches before, but at the time he felt that in Hollywood it was \"bankers making the decisions\". He believes that it is easier now for an independent film-maker to have control, and mentions David Lynch and Quentin Tarantino as two directors whose work he admires. </p> <p>Yang hopes now to make a film in Seattle and, with the kind of budget previously unavailable to him, a second world war story set in Taiwan. His homeland's ambiguous geo-politics is a constant preoccupation for Taiwanese film-makers. \"That's part of the reality so when you do a film that is genuine or authentic it has to have that element. I am an optimistic person. I think something positive will come out of this situation . . . there are a lot of things in common between [China and Taiwan] if we set aside the old ideologies.\" </p> <p>Like the small boy with the camera in A One and a Two, Yang seems now to be in the perfect position to use film to show people the parts of their lives that they normally miss. </p> <p> \u0095 A One and a Two is released on Friday.</p>",

But after we made a name for ourselves we had different directions to go in, and in the last 10 years it has been pretty much individual efforts.\" A One and a Two has been in gestation for more than a decade, its origins lying in a friend's dying relative. He was in a coma but the doctors felt he might benefit if people addressed him as if he could understand everything. \"It was quite overwhelming to me to talk to the person pretending he's normal. In that kind of situation you have to be very honest not just to him but to yourself. That was in the 1980s but I knew I was too young to make the film then.\" Yang was then in his late 30s. \"I let it sit in my head so that all the details came in and settled, and when I finally proposed the story [to the film's Japanese backers] two years ago, I felt I was ready.\" One of the film's most memorable parts involves the obser vations of the small boy, played unselfconsciously by Jonathan Chang. \"I didn't think that much about that part over the years. Most of the details developed during the writing because basically that character is the foundation of all the other characters, someone we all once were. Most of the people I talk to share similar feelings, whether they are men or women. I think we were all once that way, with all kinds of questions, and we didn't know which one was more philosophical than the other because we didn't have answers to any of them.\" Yang gives credit to his largely unknown cast for the success of the film. \"The writing doesn't stop at the script; that's a blueprint. There is still room with actors to accommodate their strengths and avoid their weaknesses. It's like a building - it has to be built under one concept or it doesn't work. Taiwan does not have a big pool of actors, and Jonathan was only seven at the time and I was looking for a 10-year-old. But he caught my casting director's eye and he said, 'Take a look at this kid.' I said 'Gee!' I was worried whether he would understand the things I would ask him to do but he was so smart.\" While Yang's work has always found a responsive audience in Taipei, Europe was the first territory overseas to welcome it. \"The London Film Festival in 1983 was the first moment that Taiwan's new cinema got a chance to be exposed to the world. I did one segment of a film done by four young film-makers that was invited to the festival and I hand-carried the tapes to London . . . After that, I think people realised what was happening and Derek Malcolm [the Guardian's film critic at the time] came to Taipei.\" Japan followed suit. But it took years before the west was prepared to give proper releases to Asian films that were not exclusively concerned with martial arts. The success of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Wong Kar-Wai's In the Mood for Love may push the doors wider open. Yang is interested in exploring the world that the new technologies have created. \"We have more and more things in common than in the past, especially in the cities. In the last 10 years, I [have become] more familiar with the streets of Tokyo and Hong Kong and some parts of Paris and LA than the rural areas of my own country.\" He has finished a script about \"a young kid who travels the world with just a cellphone and a credit card. Those two things are all you need now. It's a new world and there are a lot of stories we can tell each other.\" The success of A One and a Two has already led to new offers. \"I feel like an athlete - all these clubs seeing if you would like to join the team. There are new possibilities but I think it depends on whether my style fits into their game - and if it does, it's wonderful.\" There had been approaches before, but at the time he felt that in Hollywood it was \"bankers making the decisions\". He believes that it is easier now for an independent film-maker to have control, and mentions David Lynch and Quentin Tarantino as two directors whose work he admires. Yang hopes now to make a film in Seattle and, with the kind of budget previously unavailable to him, a second world war story set in Taiwan. His homeland's ambiguous geo-politics is a constant preoccupation for Taiwanese film-makers. \"That's part of the reality so when you do a film that is genuine or authentic it has to have that element. I am an optimistic person. I think something positive will come out of this situation . . . there are a lot of things in common between [China and Taiwan] if we set aside the old ideologies.\" Like the small boy with the camera in A One and a Two, Yang seems now to be in the perfect position to use film to show people the parts of their lives that they normally miss. \u0095 A One and a Two is released on Friday.",

Lawyers for the parents, the Americans Tranda and Aaron Wecker, have asked the official solicitor's child protection office to deal with their request. The news came as Alan and Judith Kilshaw, the UK couple at the centre of the transatlantic legal wrangle, returned to the high court in London to continue their fight to win custody of the nine-month-old girls. It also emerged yesterday that Max Clifford, the PR consultant, has offered to help the parents, who have come under fire for speaking in public about the case after promising that they would not do so. The latest hearing, which could last all week, is taking place in private but a spokesman for the Lord Chancellor's Department said that the natural parents, who are estranged and taking action separately, wanted the babies declared abducted. The US and Britain have signed up to the Hague convention on intercountry adoption, which was designed to set guidelines for international adoptions and restrict child trafficking and fraud.

      "body": "<p>A European Union delegation was given a cool reception when it arrived in Washington yesterday in the hope of persuading the Bush administration to rethink its rejection of the Kyoto treaty on global warming. </p> <p>The chairman of the Senate environment committee, Robert Smith, cancelled a meeting with the delegation led by Kjell Larsson, the Swedish environment minister, and Margot Wallstrom. A spokeswoman for Mr Smith, a rightwing opponent of the 1997 Kyoto accord, said he would be too busy participating in Senate votes. </p> <p>The EU negotiators are trying to secure a firm undertaking that the US will play a substantive role in global environment talks in Bonn in mid-July, when the implementation of the Kyoto deal is due to be discussed. </p> <p>US diplomats have said a delegation from Washington would attend to put forward \"alternative\" means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but it was far from clear yesterday what those alternatives were. </p> <p>An EU diplomat said: \"It is a blank slate. We are as much in the dark as anyone here. We will just have to wait to hear what they have to say.\" </p> <p>Today, Mr Larsson and Ms Wallstrom are due to meet Christine Todd Whitman, the administrator of the US environmental protection agency (EPA), whose earlier support for Kyoto was overruled by President Bush, and who was forced into a humiliating policy reversal. </p> <p>Asked what a US delegation might put forward in Bonn, an EPA official yesterday would only say: \"It's too early to tell.\" </p> <p>The only other administration officials meeting the delegation are relatively junior -Richard Armitage, a deputy secretary of state, and Gary Edson, the deputy assistant to the president for international economic policy. </p> <p>A US official said yesterday that the Bush administration had been angered by Ms Wallstrom's remarks last week, hinting that the EU might take retaliatory action for the US withdrawal from the accord. </p> <p>The US national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, told European ambassadors a fortnight ago that the Bush administration considered the accord dead. </p> <p>The position was made public last week by Ms Whitman, who said the accord put too little of the burden for controlling greenhouse gas emissions on developing countries, and too much on the US, which was supposed to have reduced its emissions by 7% from 1990 levels by 2012. Although backed by the Clinton administration, the agreement was never ratified by the Senate. </p> <p>EU environment ministers meeting in Sweden at the weekend said they would continue to work towards the implementation of the Kyoto agreement with or without US participation. </p> <p>Jan Pronk of the Netherlands said he was preparing a new set of implementation proposals and hoped to assemble the main 40 participating countries for a conference in New York on April 21. He suggested that the US position might eventually soften. </p> <p>\"Give them some time. Without the USA, the EU would have to negotiate with Canada, Japan and Australia... There is still a lot that has to be discussed with them,\" he said. </p> <p>The White House insists it still takes the issue of greenhouse gas emissions seriously. When Mr Bush came to office in January he set up a \"carbon rump group\" to reassess the US position, but its report was pre-empted by an announcement last month indicating that the administration was withdrawing a campaign pledge to impose statutory limits on carbon dioxide emissions. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the vice-president, Dick Cheney, is at the head of an energy task force, which is due to report in May on recent power shortages in California. His report is expected to deal with the issue of emissions but European observers in Washington don't hold out much hope. Mr Cheney is thought to be the leading hardliner on the environment in the White House, leading the move to dump Kyoto.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A European Union delegation was given a cool reception when it arrived in Washington yesterday in the hope of persuading the Bush administration to rethink its rejection of the Kyoto treaty on global warming. The chairman of the Senate environment committee, Robert Smith, cancelled a meeting with the delegation led by Kjell Larsson, the Swedish environment minister, and Margot Wallstrom. A spokeswoman for Mr Smith, a rightwing opponent of the 1997 Kyoto accord, said he would be too busy participating in Senate votes. The EU negotiators are trying to secure a firm undertaking that the US will play a substantive role in global environment talks in Bonn in mid-July, when the implementation of the Kyoto deal is due to be discussed. US diplomats have said a delegation from Washington would attend to put forward \"alternative\" means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but it was far from clear yesterday what those alternatives were. An EU diplomat said: \"It is a blank slate. We are as much in the dark as anyone here. We will just have to wait to hear what they have to say.\" Today, Mr Larsson and Ms Wallstrom are due to meet Christine Todd Whitman, the administrator of the US environmental protection agency (EPA), whose earlier support for Kyoto was overruled by President Bush, and who was forced into a humiliating policy reversal. Asked what a US delegation might put forward in Bonn, an EPA official yesterday would only say: \"It's too early to tell.\" The only other administration officials meeting the delegation are relatively junior -Richard Armitage, a deputy secretary of state, and Gary Edson, the deputy assistant to the president for international economic policy. A US official said yesterday that the Bush administration had been angered by Ms Wallstrom's remarks last week, hinting that the EU might take retaliatory action for the US withdrawal from the accord. The US national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, told European ambassadors a fortnight ago that the Bush administration considered the accord dead. The position was made public last week by Ms Whitman, who said the accord put too little of the burden for controlling greenhouse gas emissions on developing countries, and too much on the US, which was supposed to have reduced its emissions by 7% from 1990 levels by 2012. Although backed by the Clinton administration, the agreement was never ratified by the Senate. EU environment ministers meeting in Sweden at the weekend said they would continue to work towards the implementation of the Kyoto agreement with or without US participation. Jan Pronk of the Netherlands said he was preparing a new set of implementation proposals and hoped to assemble the main 40 participating countries for a conference in New York on April 21. He suggested that the US position might eventually soften. \"Give them some time. Without the USA, the EU would have to negotiate with Canada, Japan and Australia... There is still a lot that has to be discussed with them,\" he said. The White House insists it still takes the issue of greenhouse gas emissions seriously. When Mr Bush came to office in January he set up a \"carbon rump group\" to reassess the US position, but its report was pre-empted by an announcement last month indicating that the administration was withdrawing a campaign pledge to impose statutory limits on carbon dioxide emissions. Meanwhile, the vice-president, Dick Cheney, is at the head of an energy task force, which is due to report in May on recent power shortages in California. His report is expected to deal with the issue of emissions but European observers in Washington don't hold out much hope. Mr Cheney is thought to be the leading hardliner on the environment in the White House, leading the move to dump Kyoto.",

Of 87 decided between October and mid-February, 15 succeeded, according to figures from the human rights research unit at King's College law school, University of London.

Powers which allow the environment secretary, rather than planning inspectors, to take the final decision himself violated the right to an impartial tribunal, said the judges, because the same person \"cannot be both policy maker and decision taker\". The government has now appealed against the ruling to the House of Lords, where rumour has it that the law lords may overturn it.</p> <p>Ministers predicted in the run-up to the act that declarations of incompatibility would be rare.

There will also be a \u00a3500m expansion in resources with staff increased by 4,500 beyond the existing 16,000 total. The probation service hopes to recruit an extra 3,000 staff, including former teachers and psychologists, within the next 12 months alone.</p> <p>Eithne Wallis, director of the national probation service, said yesterday she was determined to see probation shed its \"soft option\" tag, with targets to reduce reconviction rates by 5% for the 200,000 offenders under its supervision.</p> <p>Additionally, there will be \"multi-agency public protection panels\" involving the police, probation and clinical psychologists, who will assess risk and decide how paedophiles and other dangerous offenders are released into the community. The panels will also include representatives from the local health and education services.</p> <p>Ms Wallis said it would not mean parents having the right to know if a sex offender moves to their area, but people would be informed about any measures taken - though not necessarily offenders' addresses.</p> <p>The probation service also plans to expand places on sex offender treatment programmes outside jail. So far, only about 500 known sex offenders in the community take part in the courses. The aim is to involve all 4,000 known sex offenders outside jail within two years.</p> <p>All those serious offenders serving a prison sentence of more than 12 months will fall under the scheme to consult the victims over their release.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Victims of crime are to be consulted on the conditions of release for the 200 to 300 violent and sexual criminals who leave jail each month. The statutory duty, to ask victims or their families if they want a say in the release of paedophiles and other sex offenders, came into force yesterday, alongside the launch of the national probation service. Paul Boateng, the Home Office minister, said there would be a \"law enforcement\" emphasis in the national probation service, which replaces the old structure based on 54 localities. There will also be a \u00a3500m expansion in resources with staff increased by 4,500 beyond the existing 16,000 total. The probation service hopes to recruit an extra 3,000 staff, including former teachers and psychologists, within the next 12 months alone. Eithne Wallis, director of the national probation service, said yesterday she was determined to see probation shed its \"soft option\" tag, with targets to reduce reconviction rates by 5% for the 200,000 offenders under its supervision. Additionally, there will be \"multi-agency public protection panels\" involving the police, probation and clinical psychologists, who will assess risk and decide how paedophiles and other dangerous offenders are released into the community. The panels will also include representatives from the local health and education services. Ms Wallis said it would not mean parents having the right to know if a sex offender moves to their area, but people would be informed about any measures taken - though not necessarily offenders' addresses. The probation service also plans to expand places on sex offender treatment programmes outside jail. So far, only about 500 known sex offenders in the community take part in the courses. The aim is to involve all 4,000 known sex offenders outside jail within two years. All those serious offenders serving a prison sentence of more than 12 months will fall under the scheme to consult the victims over their release.",

Innogy offshoot to be floated Innogy said it would float about 25% of electricity storage subsidiary Regenesys in the next two years and that brokers had valued the business at \u00a3500m-\u00a31bn. Chief operating officer Brian Count said the timing of the float would depend on market conditions but was unlikely to take place beyond the end of 2002. Welsh Water's \u00a32bn bond sale Welsh Water is to begin marketing a \u00a32bn multi-tranche bond, joint lead managers Schroder Salomon Smith Barney and Royal Bank of Scotland said. The bond sale will finance the company's acquisition by Glas Cymru, a not-for-profit company.",

      "body": "<p>Imperial Tobacco is planning to take its Regal and Superkings brands to smokers in sub-Saharan Africa through a \u00a3179m deal to buy 75% of Tobaccor, a leading distributor of cigarettes in the region. </p> <p>Based in Paris, Tobaccor specialises in selling cigarettes in French-speaking developing countries. Its big markets include Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and Senegal, and it has an operation in Vietnam. </p> <p>The acquisition is part of Imperial's strategy of international expansion to offset its exposure to high taxes and strict health regulations in Britain. </p> <p>Imperial's chief executive, Gareth Davis, said: \"The incidence of smoking in Africa is significantly less than in a place like western Europe but it is gradually growing. With rapid population growth, we'd expect it to stay in growth.\" </p> <p>Cigarettes were already well established in sub-Saharan Africa: \"To the people who say we're going to go and entice people to smoke, I'd say that's not true. They already do smoke and we're going to get a share of it.\" </p> <p>Tobaccor makes popular African brands such as Excellence, Hamilton and Good Look, which sell for 30p to 40p a packet. Mr Davis said Imperial would use the business's distribution network as a platform for its own cheaper brands. </p> <p>French-speaking countries in Africa are relatively economically stable because their currencies are pegged to the French franc. </p> <p>In Vietnam, Tobaccor produces Bastor, a fast-growing brand sold through a local firm, Dong Nai. </p> <p>Analyst Jonathan Fell of Merrill Lynch said the deal should enhance Imperial's earnings by 3% next year: \"They've done quite a few of these add-on acquisitions and pretty much every one of them has turned out to be attractive.\" </p> <p>Imperial's profits were flat last year in Britain, where tobacco companies have been battered by steep rises in duty and advertising bans. Its earnings rose 23% to \u00a3188m overseas, partly due to sales of cigarettes later brought back to Britain by tourists and smugglers. </p> <p>Tobaccor made profits of \u00a333m from sales of \u00a3154m last year. The remaining 25% of Tobaccor will be retained by a French conglomerate, Bollore.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Imperial Tobacco is planning to take its Regal and Superkings brands to smokers in sub-Saharan Africa through a \u00a3179m deal to buy 75% of Tobaccor, a leading distributor of cigarettes in the region. Based in Paris, Tobaccor specialises in selling cigarettes in French-speaking developing countries. Its big markets include Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and Senegal, and it has an operation in Vietnam. The acquisition is part of Imperial's strategy of international expansion to offset its exposure to high taxes and strict health regulations in Britain. Imperial's chief executive, Gareth Davis, said: \"The incidence of smoking in Africa is significantly less than in a place like western Europe but it is gradually growing. With rapid population growth, we'd expect it to stay in growth.\" Cigarettes were already well established in sub-Saharan Africa: \"To the people who say we're going to go and entice people to smoke, I'd say that's not true. They already do smoke and we're going to get a share of it.\" Tobaccor makes popular African brands such as Excellence, Hamilton and Good Look, which sell for 30p to 40p a packet. Mr Davis said Imperial would use the business's distribution network as a platform for its own cheaper brands. French-speaking countries in Africa are relatively economically stable because their currencies are pegged to the French franc. In Vietnam, Tobaccor produces Bastor, a fast-growing brand sold through a local firm, Dong Nai. Analyst Jonathan Fell of Merrill Lynch said the deal should enhance Imperial's earnings by 3% next year: \"They've done quite a few of these add-on acquisitions and pretty much every one of them has turned out to be attractive.\" Imperial's profits were flat last year in Britain, where tobacco companies have been battered by steep rises in duty and advertising bans. Its earnings rose 23% to \u00a3188m overseas, partly due to sales of cigarettes later brought back to Britain by tourists and smugglers. Tobaccor made profits of \u00a333m from sales of \u00a3154m last year. The remaining 25% of Tobaccor will be retained by a French conglomerate, Bollore.",

      "bodyText": "Moss Bros yesterday said it was concentrating on opening and modernising shops as it lurched into losses at the year-end. The company, which has 150 outlets, has been forced to revamp its image and products partly because of the introduction of dress-down customs in the workplace. Moss Bros said it would continue to move away from formal wear but suits remained an important part of the business. Shares dropped 5p to 27.5p after the group reported a loss of \u00a317.5m, including exceptional charges, such as \u00a312m for closing stores. Moss Bros posted a profit of \u00a37.8m the previous year. Losses before exceptional items were \u00a32.7m. Turnover in the first eight weeks of this year was up just 1% and like-for-like fashion sales for the year were up 2.5%. The group said Neil Benson would be replaced as chairman by Keith Hamill, a former finance director of WH Smith.",

Cunnah, the force behind D:Ream, and his songwriting partner Jamie Petrie created Things Can Only Get Better, the tune that Labour used to spread its message in the 1997 election. Cunnah even joined the future prime minister at rallies; as Blair finished his speech, Cunnah would get up on stage and rouse the audience to a mass singsong. He has never been allowed to forget it. </p> <p>\"It was all so surreal,\" recalls Cunnah in his buttered Northern Irish accent. \"I was on the Prescott Express, going round the country, performing with Tony Blair and listening to loads of fortysomethings sing my song. One day Prescott told me that he was bloody fed up with the song because he'd sung it so many times. And I said: 'John, don't even go there.' I was the really fed up one.\" </p> <p>Yet even now, the 34-year-old never knocks his number one hit. After all, it launched his career. Originally written in 1989, when Cunnah was new to London, Things was first released as a D:Ream single in January 1993 and reached a respectable 23 in the charts. But it was on the 1994 re-release that D:Ream really hit the big time. Then it was four weeks at number one. </p> <p>\"I can thank Take That for some of our success,\" he explains. \"In 1993 they asked us to be their support band on tour. It was a bit of shock because we were this hip, young dance act and they were . . . well, they were Take That.\" It was then that Cunnah took a business decision and moved D:Ream into a new direction. \"Clubbers only buy singles and 12in singles. Working with Take That meant access to a much bigger market. One where girls waved banners saying they loved you.\" </p> <p>D:Ream's first album, On Vol 1, in 1994, was well received critically and commercially. A year later, the swiftly cobbled-together World came out. It produced several top 20 singles. By this time, however, Cunnah had a \"huge drugs problem\" and was arguing with D:Ream's third member, Al Mackenzie. \"I became pretty obnoxious,\" he admits. With writs flying about over royalties (eventually settled out of court), Cunnah decided to dismantle the group. \"I was out of it. I wasn't in touch with my family or the woman I loved.\" </p> <p>Cunnah came off drugs, took time out and got himself back together. And then, in 1996, Prescott phoned. D:Ream reformed and bounced back. On a different high after the election, Cunnah went about producing a third, more mature album that was less dance-oriented. He invested \u00a360,000 of his own money, convinced his high profile would ensure interest. He was wrong. The album was too adventurous for record company bosses. </p> <p>\"They wanted me to do the same old thing. But I wanted to move on,\" says Cunnah. The album was never released and Cunnah turned to producing and songwriting. Most recently, he has written for the boy band A1. And, with Petrie, he has co-written and produced an album for Carlton TV's Saturday morning show, Star Street. </p> <p>\"I've still got ambitions and I humbly hope to repeat my earlier success,\" Cunnah says. \"But this time I want to do it with a falafel in one hand and a cup of tea in the other. And I wouldn't use my face on any promotional stuff if I went solo again. Having anonymity is more important. </p> <p>\"I've got good memories and bad. I'll never forget Peter Mandelson fluffing the words. Or the big bear hug that Alastair Campbell gave me as Portillo lost his seat. But even now I can't stand listening to the song. I'm sure Tony Blair feels the same. We just heard it too many times.\"</p>",

On a different high after the election, Cunnah went about producing a third, more mature album that was less dance-oriented. He invested \u00a360,000 of his own money, convinced his high profile would ensure interest. He was wrong. The album was too adventurous for record company bosses. \"They wanted me to do the same old thing. But I wanted to move on,\" says Cunnah. The album was never released and Cunnah turned to producing and songwriting. Most recently, he has written for the boy band A1. And, with Petrie, he has co-written and produced an album for Carlton TV's Saturday morning show, Star Street. \"I've still got ambitions and I humbly hope to repeat my earlier success,\" Cunnah says. \"But this time I want to do it with a falafel in one hand and a cup of tea in the other. And I wouldn't use my face on any promotional stuff if I went solo again. Having anonymity is more important. \"I've got good memories and bad. I'll never forget Peter Mandelson fluffing the words. Or the big bear hug that Alastair Campbell gave me as Portillo lost his seat. But even now I can't stand listening to the song. I'm sure Tony Blair feels the same. We just heard it too many times.\"",

      "bodyText": "Peruvians go to the polls at the weekend for the first time since the disgraced president Alberto Fujimori fled to Japan five months ago. But despite the desire for a fresh start, the sleazy shadow of the old regime still hangs over the country. Campaigning has been eclipsed by the revelation, in hundreds of secret videos, of a web of corruption extending to senior judges, army commanders, parliamentarians, ministers, business leaders, media owners, and even talk-show hosts. Even though none of the three leading presidential candidates, Alejandro Toledo, Lourdes Flores and Alan Garcia, has appeared in any of the videos, their entourages have been tainted. \"There's a situation of generalised distrust,\" said Giovanna Penaflor, head of the polling company Imasen. \"Voters just don't know who to believe in any more.\" The videos were shot by Mr Fujimori's spy-master Vladimiro Montesinos, mostly in the reception room at his intelligence service headquarters. The first one to appear last year caused both Mr Fujimori and Mr Montesinos to flee and provoked this Sunday's presidential and parliamentary elections. Mr Montesinos' whereabouts are unknown: the latest reports were that he had secretly undergone plastic surgery in Venezuela. Despite his absence his spectre dominates the campaign trail. Peruvians have been shocked to discover the extent of his power. He had almost all the Peruvian media in his pocket. One video shows him piling up hundreds of thousands of pounds in front of the owner of a popular television station. The station was being paid about \u00a3400,000 a month to give him the right to direct its news coverage. The owner of the newspaper Expreso is under house arrest for allegedly taking \u00a32 million from Mr Montesinos, a second television station's bosses face corruption charges, and another television magnate, Genaro Delgado Parker, was detained after a video showed him offering to shut down a hard-hitting political show in exchange for a helping hand with a court case. Mr Montesinos' influence stretched into every arm of public life. He was filmed giving orders to senior judges and offering the new head of the electoral board an extra \u00a37,000 a month in return for his compliance. Investigators say that he may have built up a fortune of about \u00a3700 million from illegal commissions on arms deals, protecting drugs traffickers, corruption, blackmail and crooked business deals. So far \u00a3140 million has been found in foreign bank accounts. Alejandro Toledo, the presidential favourite, expelled one of his MPs from the party after she acknowledged meeting Mr Montesinos twice, although she claimed that she did nothing wrong. His senior congressional candidate, Carlos Ferrero, was also in a videos, although he was shown challenging Mr Montesinos about telephone tapping and other issues. Mr Toledo has had to face up to his own video scandal. It is alleged that there is footage showing him consorting with prostitutes. Mr Toledo says he may have been filmed in October 1998 when he was kidnapped by Mr Montesinos' cronies and doped. Against this background of deceit, Peruvians are finding it harder than ever to pick a new leader. Pollsters say that the level of \"don't knows\" is higher than normal: about a fifth. Ms Penaflor says: \"It's not so easy to make a new start. There are too many things that you have to change at the same time - the crisis is economic, political, social and moral.\" She adds: \"It will probably take us five more years to make the transition to a true democracy.\"",

It's too early to tell whether early exposure to the pleasures of the American workplace - the climate-controlled interiors, the machines that dispense bad coffee, the necessity of wearing uncomfortable hosiery - has had the desired effect; but the day itself, which was devised by the feminist Ms Foundation, has become part of mainstream American culture.</p> <p>It has, as such, become an opportunity for shopping, an activity which is the American common denominator. The campaign for equality between the sexes can now begin in prepubescence with the purchase, via the Ms Foundation's website, of a close-fitting, baby style T-shirt bearing the Take Our Daughters to Work logo, a TODTW refrigerator magnet, or a mirror and lip balm set, the sales blurb for which reads: \"Looking for a role model?

A cultural preoccupation with the perils of adolescent girlhood, best represented by Mary Pipher's 1994 bestseller, Reviving Ophelia, which described the familiar transformation of bright, peppy grade-schoolers into sullen, insecure teenagers, has been joined over the past couple of years by a chorus of experts pointing to the frailties of the male. Books with titles such as Raising Cain and Real Boys have argued that boys, too, are hemmed in by rigid gender stereotypes of toughness: that boys are inducted into a culture of cruelty, in which their capacities for compassion and sensitivity are squashed. Boys are the new girls, in need of remedial encouragement and support. The increasing occurrence of school shootings in America - a kind of Take Our Parents' Guns to School movement for alienated teenage males - has encouraged further examination of the pathologies of a standard boyhood.</p> <p>This means that some workplaces have abandoned Take Our Daughters to Work Day in favour of Take Our Children to Work Day. Unsurprisingly, companies have found it hard to justify including boys by simply arguing that it's not fair to leave the boys out, since the whole point of TODTW was to counterbalance the inherent unfairness of the cultural hand that is dealt to girls. Rather, the prevailing argument for inclusion seems to be that such strides have been made for women in the workplace that it's time to let boys in on the annual event.</p> <p>Anyone who believes that sunny diagnosis should take a look at a coruscating new book by Ann Crittenden, The Price of Motherhood: Why the Most Important Job in the World is Still the Least Valued, which details the myriad ways in which women who become mothers are penalised financially, compared with their childless sisters or the men who father those children.</p> <p>The data in Crittenden's book reveal the dispiriting irony of Take Our Daughters to Work Day: that on every other day of the year, the American workplace is thoroughly inhospitable to children and their needs. There's no national entitlement for American mothers to a single day of paid maternity leave. Childcare provisions are thoroughly inadequate; you need a licence to own a dog in most states, but not to run a daycare centre. High-flying lawyers and factory workers alike are discouraged or prevented from adopting a part-time schedule by companies that ignore the demands of motherhood.</p> <p>These, of course, are the kind of issues that feminist organisations like the Ms Foundation have been campaigning over for years; and the truth is that their efforts have improved the lot of the current generation of working women over that of their mothers.</p> <p>Still, the little girls who go to Take Our Daughters to Work day would be well served by changes in the law that would make it easier for mothers to be available to their children and to hold down a job at the same time.

Clearly the greasepaint, the comic hats and the jokes (\"My wife's so thin that when she drinks tomato juice she looks like a thermometer\") brought out a side to my grandfather's character that would otherwise have lain dormant, providing a kind of emotional release that reconciled him to the Norwich back-to-backs and the meter-reading.</p> <p>Or perhaps, on the other hand, there was more humour to my grandfather's life than anyone ever realised.

Come the 1935 general election, and the preordained return of the National Government, my father - then aged 14 - asked him who he intended to vote for. \"I shall be voting for Mr Geoffrey Shakespeare, the Liberal candidate,\" he replied. \"But dad, he's a National Liberal.

      "bodyText": "As the Real IRA ups its terrorist campaign in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain, loyalist paramilitaries are signing up hundreds of teenagers as recruits, even though they are supposed to be on ceasefire, sources said. A small renegade group, the Orange Volunteers, which opposes the peace process, is recruiting on a modest scale for a doomsday \"defend Ulster\" scenario. It is on \"strategic cessation\" but has threatened that dissident republican attacks in London could soon spark retaliation, possibly in the Irish Republic. But the two main Protestant organisations, the Ulster Defence Association/Ulster Freedom Fighters, and the Ulster Volunteer Force, both on ceasefire since October 1994, are also taking on new members at an alarming rate. They argue that they are doing this is to keep young people out of the clutches of dissidents and drug barons. However, security sources are concerned that the network of paramilitary influence is widening rather than shrinking following the Good Friday agreement, and that it could pose big problems, should the political process break down. Recent police finds in Belfast of a pipe bomb factory, thought to belong to the UVF, and of weapons linked to the dissident Loyalist Volunteer Force, are worrying the security forces. \"We are aware of recruitment but a more dramatic increase might be expected before Drumcree [the anniver sary of the disputed Portadown Orange Order march in July],\" said a security source. The leader of the UDA's south Belfast brigade said: \"In the past, it was the done thing in many loyalist areas to join the paramilitaries, and a lot of kids still want to get involved. Now, they are growing up in a void and we've got to keep control and give them a sense of identity. \"The Ulster Young Militants [the UDA youth wing] used not to take them until they were 17 or 18, but now it's 14 or 15 because they are at an age where they are bowing to peer pressure. We've taken on hundreds in south Belfast alone and around the country. \"We're not teaching them to shoot or bomb, but we're trying to educate them about history, computers, and job skills. Most of us were sceptical about the agreement from the start, and all six UDA brigades are against it now, but we do want peace.\" Security sources blamed individuals within the UDA for the recent pipe bomb campaign, which has targeted more than 50 Catholic homes since the start of the year, but seems to have petered out since the UDA command issued an edict for them to stop. The UDA south Belfast brigadier condemned the attacks, and said he thought renegade groups and youths who did not belong to any organisation were responsible. Security sources have accused the UDA/UFF in Belfast's lower Shankill area, under the command of the jailed Johnny Adair, of serious involvement in drug dealing. Teenage loyalists in other parts of Northern Ireland, such as Ballymena, Co Antrim, have been involved in sectarian intimidation. The south Belfast brigadier said that neither the UDA nor the rival UVF could deny some members were drug dealers or had got into sectarian fights but claimed responsible leaders were trying to educate young people about drug dangers. A senior UVF man said his organisation, which he stressed was totally behind the Good Friday deal, was recruiting young members, from 17 upwards, but mainly to keep them from the UDA, which they believed was heavily involved in drugs. He admitted there was still a level of weapons training \"to maintain their interest\". Regarding recent police finds of pipe bombs and dossiers on republicans, he said: \"If people think the UVF doesn't have war material, they are gravely mistaken.\" While the UDA/UFF and UVF have thousands of members, the dissident Orange Volunteers are believed to have only around 100 active members, but a source close to the leadership insisted that there was a steady stream of people of all ages interested in joining. The Orange Volunteers want an independent Northern Ireland with a majority unionist government. The source claimed many were also members of the Orange Order and a significant number were former soldiers or policemen. \"Many are also born again Christians. There have been wild stories about guns and bombs being blessed before an operation, but that is not true.\" The Orange Volunteers have hinted they could launch gun and bomb attacks on republican areas of Northern Ireland, and also in Dublin, in future if they believed it would further their cause.",

He wanted to \"awaken all Americans to the fact that the Smithsonian belonged to them, not to a bunch of curmudgeons on Capitol Hill\".</p> <p>This became evident during 1968 as poor people's campaigners camped out near the Lincoln Memorial after the Washington riots and the assassination of Martin Luther King. Ridley reminded worried staff that \"these people are American citizens, and they must be made to feel welcome in our museums\". When thousands of anti-Vietnam war demonstrators converged, he told Smithsonian guards to treat them with dignity and respect.</p> <p>Ripley's empire in the US capital also included the National Portrait Gallery, the National Zoo, the National Museum of American Art, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Another centre, the Renwick Gallery, resulted from his suggestion to President Lyndon Johnson that a building opposite the White House would be an ideal place to show off US art to visiting dignitaries.</p> <p>Ripley was also a prime mover in the launch of the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, especially for Washington's black community. The Hirshhorn Museum, housing a uranium millionaire's unprecedented modern art collection, and the $75m South Quadrangle complex for the museums of Asian and African Art were further achievements.</p> <p>His younger life had been an adventure of a very different sort. The son of a Manhattan stockbroker, his great grandfather was Sidney Dillon, the Union Pacific railroad's first chairman, who acquired the 2,000-acre Connecticut estate where the 10-year old Ripley diverted a stream to create a wildfowl pond. At 13, he went on a walking tour of Tibet.</p> <p>His professional life was to be largely shaped by his passion for natural history - birds, in particular - and travel. Educated at a Massachussetts boarding school, his realisation that museums should be accessible and varied was fired by a holiday in Paris - with visits to the Louvre, rides on a carousel and watching Punch and Judy shows in the Tuileries gardens. After becoming secretary at the Smithsonian, he had a carousel installed on Washington's National Mall. He marked his graduation in history from Yale University in 1936 by joining an 18-month expedition to the South Seas aboard a 59ft schooner.</p> <p>After gaining his doctorate at Harvard in 1943, Ripley joined the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA, and was sent to south-east Asia. His duties included coordinating Anglo-American intelligence efforts and training agents bound for Japanese-held territory. When opportunities arose, he added to his specimen collections.</p> <p>Joining the Yale faculty in 1946, he gained international recognition as a zoologist, and became a professor of zoology, a professor of biology and director of the uni versity's Peabody Museum, from 1959-64, after which he went to the Smithsonian.</p> <p>On his retirement 20 years later, the Smithsonian had 4,500 employees, a $250m annual budget and more than 30m visitors a year. He described the job as \"one of the most complex and pleasurable in the world\". The institution had \"electricity, and surprise and sometimes shock. Excitement pervades the place.\"</p> <p>Ripley embarked on many expeditions. He spent almost a year with the Karoon cannibals of New Guinea, ret-urning with 1,300 rare birds for museums. He explored parts of Nepal never before seen by westerners, and found a bird species - the spiny babbler - that had not been recorded for a century. These experiences were reflected in two of his 10 books, Trail Of The Money Bird (1942) and Search For The Spiny Babbler (1953). His most distinguished work was the 10-volume Handbook Of The Birds Of India And Pakistan (1968-74), co-written with Salim Ali, a comprehensive guide to the sub-continent's 1,200-plus species.</p> <p>When he retired, the Smithsonian gave Ripley the title of secretary emeritus and an office to continue his research. An ultimate tribute was paid in 1985 when he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honour.</p> <p>His wife, Mary, whom he had married in 1949, died in 1996. He is survived by his three daughters and 11 grand- children.</p> <p>Sidney Dillon Ripley, ornithologist and museum director, born September 20 1913; died March 12 2001</p>",

When he retired, the Smithsonian gave Ripley the title of secretary emeritus and an office to continue his research. An ultimate tribute was paid in 1985 when he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honour. His wife, Mary, whom he had married in 1949, died in 1996. He is survived by his three daughters and 11 grand- children. Sidney Dillon Ripley, ornithologist and museum director, born September 20 1913; died March 12 2001",

His work went through many periods and stages of development and, in the last 15 years, when he mainly painted in water-colours, he invented a unique way of focusing the radiance of colour which watercolour artists, notably Turner and Whistler, had discovered through the diffusion of light in the watery medium.</p> <p>Napper always wanted to be a painter. His mother was an opera singer and his father an actor and watercolourist. Their son grew into a large, gentle-mannered man, an expert on everything, with a twinkle of self-parody in his eye.</p> <p>He was educated at Frensham Heights, Surrey, and privately. He trained at the Dundee School of Art and the Royal Academy School, under Sir Gerald Kelly, one of the leading portraitists of the era, in the demanding and traditional manner of classical painting. At the end of every day, he had to clean the brushes Kelly had used, frequently hundred or more of them. That way, Kelly said, Napper would learn more about technique than by watching him paint. The young artist never forgot this lesson and, in an arts and crafts sense, his technical ability, knowledge and workmanship were superb.</p> <p>During the second world war, Napper was sent as a war artist to Ceylon and east Africa. The violent sensuality, colour and form of the tropics had a profound effect on his work and composition. His 1935 marriage to Hedvig Armour had ended in divorce; back in London in 1945, he met and married his great love, the beautiful Pauline Davidson, who became his lifelong muse, model, companion and inspiration.</p> <p>He taught life art at St Martin's School of Art from 1949-57, and became a fashionable portrait painter. His portrait of the Queen in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, is impressive, although, as he often said, it was \"not a portrait of the Queen but of a queen\". As if in unconscious protest at the formality of the composition, the head is slightly out of proportion with the magnificent scale of the rest of the work.</p> <p>Napper did not want to emulate Kelly by becoming a society portrait painter, so, in 1957, he and his wife moved to Paris, and a studio in La Ruche (the Beehive) in outer Montparnasse. From 1900-25, the area harboured some of the greatest Russian emigr\u00e9 artists, among them Leger, Zadkine, Brancusi, Chagall, Kisling and Soutine. Modigliani often stayed there, as did Lenin and Trotsky. When the Nappers arrived, they had virtually no money, and it was intensely cold - they often slept fully-dressed in their overcoats.</p> <p>La Ruche was next door to the Vaugirard slaughterhouses, then the largest in Paris, and the Nappers benefited from the culinary generosity of the abattoir workers (as had Soutine 35 years earlier). John produced dark brooding oils, powerful expressionist works which he occasionally showed to acquaintances in later years. But the trauma of making them in the midst of poverty, depression and alcoholism finally forced him to leave La Ruche.</p> <p>His next port of call was Brittany, where he became friendly with Georges Braque, and began a fascination with folk music and musicians which would last for the rest of his life. After spending time in the remote Auvergne, he associated with the separatist, environmentalist, Breton folk music move-ment, and met musicians like Youenn Gwernnig, the spiritual brother to Jack Kerouac, also of Breton origin.</p> <p>Napper's worldwide folk music contacts dated from this period, and from the time he spent as visiting professor of art at the University of Southern Illinois (1968-69).

Taking over as as editor himself in 1944, he spent 53 years on the paper, which was then backing the Indian National Congress struggle for independence.

The recommendations of the independent inquiry are expected to shock hospitals, where doctors already face pressure to \"tell all\" and abandon hierarchical attitudes towards colleagues and patients.

The inquiry into children's heart services at the Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals in London, found a \"serious breakdown in communication and trust\" between some parents and doctors.

Some families had alleged that they were encouraged to believe surgery could make it more difficult to look after their children later in life and that they were not told fully about the risks of treatment. The recommendation to tape consultations and send parents copies of letters from consultants to GPs, was among 102 directed at the trust. The inquiry chairman Ruth Evans, former head of the National Consumer Council , said her team hoped other hospitals would \"implement recommendations, where they are needed, across the board.\" Health officials yesterday admitted it would be difficult to introduce such procedures nationwide for only a few categories of patients and operations.

      "bodyText": "The new Tate Modern almost singlehandedly pushed visitor numbers to national museums up by a fifth, with all but 700,000 of the extra 4.7m people who visited galleries last year walking through the cavernous entrance to the former power station on London's Bankside. Tate Modern's amazing performance, which makes it the most successful new museum in the world, masks big rises for smaller institutions like the newly refurbished National Portrait Gallery, which saw its visitors go up by a nearly a fifth, and smaller though significant rises for the Victoria and Albert museum and the British museum, whose revamped great court did not open in time to be fully reflected in the figures. The Tate's triumph - its four galleries in London, Liverpool and St Ives taken together attracted 6.7m people - was further enhanced last night when Tate Modern's Swiss architects, Herzog and De Meuron, won the Pritzker prize, the most prestigious architecture award in the world , for their conversion of the 1950s building. \"This is doubly fantastic news,\" a Tate spokeswoman said last night. \"We anticipated 2m visitors in our first year for Tate Modern, and the way things are looking now we will have hit the 5m mark by its first birthday in May.\" The culture secretary, Chris Smith, said the overall number would be even better next year since the announcement that admission charges are to be scrapped in all of the 17 galleries which his department helps to fund. Significantly, visitors numbers at the main dissident charging museums, the Science and Natural History museums in London, were among the few to remain static. Mr Smith said: \"These figures are great news and are further evidence of just how popular our national museums and galleries are with the public. They are giving millions of people the opportunity to be stimulated, educated and inspired. \"The huge success of Tate Modern shows there is a very real interest in contemporary art, an area which is often criticised for being impenetrable and deliberately controversial,\" Mr Smith added.",

The total number of animals to be slaughtered was expected to pass 1m today.</p> <p>Evidence that the government is losing the battle came in the numbers of animals condemned but still waiting to be slaughtered. The toll had risen to 345,000 yesterday morning - an increase of 20,000 a day since Thursday.</p> <p>Cumbria was again the worst blackspot on Sunday with 23 new cases and another 11 notified by lunchtime yesterday, making a total for the county of more than 380, out of a national total of 933, defeating all the combined attempts of the army and the Ministry of Agriculture to keep pace. There now seems no immediate prospect of implementing the policy of slaughtering all animals on farms within 24 hours of the disease being discovered, as the prime minister promised last week when he personally took control of the crisis.</p> <p>Just as disturbing for the government were the new cases in the north-east. There were four in Northumberland on Sunday, two in Durham and two in Tyne and Wear. The latter were the first in the county since March 22, ending hopes that the disease was being confined.</p> <p>At the other end of the country there were another seven cases in Devon and one in Cornwall, the first for four weeks. Cheshire, Staffordshire, Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, Monmouthshire, Powys and Dumfries and Galloway all had new outbreaks.</p> <p>The Ministry of Agriculture kept hidden over the weekend a record number of 64 new cases on Friday. There were another 20 cases on Saturday and 54 yesterday.</p> <p>Elsewhere, there were no new cases in France or Ireland, but Holland seemed to be struggling to contain the disease with the number of outbreaks reaching 12. Estimates of the cost in Holland have risen to \u00a350m as the Dutch slaughter all animals within two miles of outbreaks. They have also reportedly begun ring vaccination.</p> <p>In Cumbria the government is still undecided on vaccination. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, was in the county yesterday apparently trying to convince dairy farmers that vaccination should be implemented. But they were worried their milk might be unsaleable.</p> <p>Mr Brown said: \"I have not come here to make any announcement. The issue is still under review. The arguments are not all one way. There are a range of strategies under consideration.\"</p> <p>The European Commission has advised Britain also to consider vaccinating zoo animals if there is a risk of rare animals catching the disease.</p> <p>The government yesterday gave the army the go ahead to bury 25,000 cattle at the disused Great Orton airfield. More than 40 trucks laden with about 2,500 carcasses had been held up at the airfield because of Department of Health fears that burying cattle could spread mad cow disease. But Mr Brown said that as long as the animals were born after August 1996 there was no danger of spreading BSE.</p> <p>\"We are now clearing the backlog,\" said Lt Col Andrew Taverner, the army's spokesman. \"But we will still be burning and rendering cattle as well as burying animals under five years old.</p> <p>\"We are anxious not to over fill the Great Orton site and so use up all our sheep space. But we now feel we have the matter in hand.\"</p> <p>By yesterday 3,657 farmers had asked for 1,354,000 animals to be slaughtered because of restrictions on animal movements. Nearly 1m of these were sheep and 312,000 were pigs.</p> <p>The government is prepared to compensate for 90% of the value of the animals under the so-called welfare slaughter scheme.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the intervention board in Newcastle said 31,811 animals had been slaughtered and 19 abattoirs were dedicated to the scheme. As soon as they were all operating they would have a capacity to kill 280,000 animals a week. The carcasses would be taken to six landfill sites and one rendering plant for disposal. Applications to the welfare scheme were still being received.</p> <p>The chaos in Cumbria mounted yesterday when a pyre for burning cattle at a farm was scrapped after complaints that it was too close to houses in Carlisle. It was built last week to burn 120 cattle at Cummersdale Grange Farm, plus another 250 from a farm near Rose Castle.</p> <p>The decision came after the intervention of Eric Martle, Labour MP for Carlisle. The animals will now be taken to a rendering plant instead and the pyre dismantled. <br><br></p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our

There are a range of strategies under consideration.\" The European Commission has advised Britain also to consider vaccinating zoo animals if there is a risk of rare animals catching the disease. The government yesterday gave the army the go ahead to bury 25,000 cattle at the disused Great Orton airfield. More than 40 trucks laden with about 2,500 carcasses had been held up at the airfield because of Department of Health fears that burying cattle could spread mad cow disease. But Mr Brown said that as long as the animals were born after August 1996 there was no danger of spreading BSE. \"We are now clearing the backlog,\" said Lt Col Andrew Taverner, the army's spokesman. \"But we will still be burning and rendering cattle as well as burying animals under five years old. \"We are anxious not to over fill the Great Orton site and so use up all our sheep space. But we now feel we have the matter in hand.\" By yesterday 3,657 farmers had asked for 1,354,000 animals to be slaughtered because of restrictions on animal movements. Nearly 1m of these were sheep and 312,000 were pigs. The government is prepared to compensate for 90% of the value of the animals under the so-called welfare slaughter scheme. A spokeswoman for the intervention board in Newcastle said 31,811 animals had been slaughtered and 19 abattoirs were dedicated to the scheme. As soon as they were all operating they would have a capacity to kill 280,000 animals a week. The carcasses would be taken to six landfill sites and one rendering plant for disposal. Applications to the welfare scheme were still being received. The chaos in Cumbria mounted yesterday when a pyre for burning cattle at a farm was scrapped after complaints that it was too close to houses in Carlisle. It was built last week to burn 120 cattle at Cummersdale Grange Farm, plus another 250 from a farm near Rose Castle. The decision came after the intervention of Eric Martle, Labour MP for Carlisle. The animals will now be taken to a rendering plant instead and the pyre dismantled.

It kicks in immediately but can take between five and 12 days to build up fully. One dose for a cow can immunise five sheep. </p> <p> <b> Would mass vaccination of an area completely rid animals of foot and mouth?</b> </p> <p> No. Because vaccinated animals carry the disease, it would be seen as endemic in those herds or flocks.

There's another possibility. They could ennoble the chief justice of New Zealand, Dame San Elias, which would make her eligible to sit. There is a precedent: Lord Cooke of Thorndon, a former head of New Zealand's appeal court, has frequently sat as a law lord.

This led ultimately to our lunchtime destination some way up the valley bank.

      "bodyText": "Bright sunshine and a cloudless blue sky heralded us to an uncompromised Chinese breakfast of cold vegetables, warm hard boiled eggs and stale white bread - as we prepared, amid anxious exchanges about the rigours of walking the wall the previous day, for our foray into the Black Dragon Paw Park. A steep climb up steps hewn into large rocks, followed by a downward trail equally demanding, although on different muscles, brought us to the path of the river that winds silently, frequently strewn with patches of ice and snow, over a rocky river bed. Almost without intent, the trail then turned away from the dramatic ravine of the river punctuated by the occasional frozen waterfall to become a meandering narrow soil track, sometimes confusing as to its direction. This led ultimately to our lunchtime destination some way up the valley bank. Calls of \"knee how\" - Chinese for \"good day\" - reverberated round the valley between the bestraggled line of trekkers. The group's concerns for individual members has been evident from the start, and six days on bonds are forged more solidly, promoted by the shared experiences of this different culture and the impact of walking the wall. As we strike on up the hillside after lunch (yet more boiled eggs, a staple food so it seems) I remember the descriptions of the children in Chinese orphanages given by fellow trekkers from Care for Children.

If the contribution from Care for Children is only 100 English pounds a year for a foster placement, there must be the possibility of increasing the number of children given the opportunity of family life rather than remaining in emotionally-impoverished residential care.
