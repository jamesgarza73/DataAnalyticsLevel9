Sammy McIlroy's men have now collected only four points from five matches, and the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Denmark are contesting the top two places. The manager was scathing in his criticism of his back division, accusing them of \"schoolboy errors\" and claiming that all four goals should have been prevented. \"When you give away a penalty like we did in the opening minutes there is always an uphill struggle,\" he said. Northern Ireland repeatedly put themselves under pressure with misplaced passes and sloppy clearances during an error-ridden first half and found it difficult coping with the pace and interchanges of the Bulgarian forwards. Yet again they conceded an early goal when the midfielder Jim Magilton made a bad back-pass and the Preston centre-back Colin Murdock brought down Bulgaria's centre-forward Krassimir Balakov, who scored from the spot. After a 15th-minute reply from Mark Williams, who rose above three defenders to head in a corner from Michael Hughes, another defensive blunder two minutes later let in Martin Petrov, who dribbled past Danny Griffin, stumbled, but still managed to get the ball past the keeper Roy Carroll from an acute angle. Northern Ireland looked a much more confident and committed unit after the interval, until Carroll let a 40-yard free-kick from Krasmir Tchomakov spin through his hands into the net after 72 minutes. Four minutes later Petrov struck again with a half-volley at the far post, but the match then took another bizarre turn as the Irish contrived a barnstorming finish.

Market forces and the trading market are going to impact us.\" </p> <p>Several rival jewellers, including the American market leader Zale, have recently warned of deteriorating demand as consumers take note of increasingly gloomy economic forecasts. </p> <p>Bad news from the jewellery industry has sent Signet's shares down by a quarter this month. They edged up 2p to 65.5p yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Burman said some gems remained popular with Americans - particularly sapphires and tanzanite, a blue stone noted for its bright shine that was originally found in Tanzania. </p> <p>\"Blue seems to be popular. It tends to co-ordinate with fashionable clothing colours.\" </p> <p>In Britain, Signet's H Samuel and Ernest Jones chains gained from an increasing focus on diamonds. Their profits jumped 27% to \u00a350m. </p> <p>Mr Burman said a move upmarket had pleased customers: \"H Samuel customers have responded very well to our diamond offering - more and more UK consumers are wearing diamonds.\" </p> <p>He said diamonds were popular not only in rings but in pendants, earrings and bracelets: \"We're not just talking about weddings and engagements - this is the fashion market, we're competing with handbags and scarves.\" </p> <p>Signet, the world's largest speciality jewellery retailer, emerged from the remnants of the Ratner group. The company has 1,604 shops, including 999 in the US. </p> <p>The company is enjoying a surge in the popularity of St Valentine's Day. Mr Burman said: \"It's getting more and more popular both in the US and the UK. Five years ago, we'd only have seen a fraction of the demand we see now.\"</p>",

Signet announced a 27% jump in annual pretax profits to \u00a3162m but noted a \"sharp deterioration\" towards the end of the year in the American market, which accounts for 71% of its sales. The company's chief executive, Terry Burman, said Signet's American chains, Kay Jewelers and Jared, were proving resilient thanks to romantic advertising slogans such as \"Every kiss begins with Kay\". However, he added: \"We can't fight gravity. Market forces and the trading market are going to impact us.\" Several rival jewellers, including the American market leader Zale, have recently warned of deteriorating demand as consumers take note of increasingly gloomy economic forecasts. Bad news from the jewellery industry has sent Signet's shares down by a quarter this month. They edged up 2p to 65.5p yesterday. Mr Burman said some gems remained popular with Americans - particularly sapphires and tanzanite, a blue stone noted for its bright shine that was originally found in Tanzania. \"Blue seems to be popular. It tends to co-ordinate with fashionable clothing colours.\" In Britain, Signet's H Samuel and Ernest Jones chains gained from an increasing focus on diamonds. Their profits jumped 27% to \u00a350m. Mr Burman said a move upmarket had pleased customers: \"H Samuel customers have responded very well to our diamond offering - more and more UK consumers are wearing diamonds.\" He said diamonds were popular not only in rings but in pendants, earrings and bracelets: \"We're not just talking about weddings and engagements - this is the fashion market, we're competing with handbags and scarves.\" Signet, the world's largest speciality jewellery retailer, emerged from the remnants of the Ratner group. The company has 1,604 shops, including 999 in the US. The company is enjoying a surge in the popularity of St Valentine's Day. Mr Burman said: \"It's getting more and more popular both in the US and the UK. Five years ago, we'd only have seen a fraction of the demand we see now.\"",

The dancers' minutely calibrated movements make them seem, as always, like priests in some painfully elevated trance. Time passes slowly, the seconds marked in this show by the drip, drip of water into huge glass dishes. </p> <p>In Hibiki, Sankai Juku are as perfect as they always are within the formula they have set themselves. So is there any sense in considering whether this new show is any better or worse than the others? Or even if it's any different? </p> <p>The curtain rises on a stage circled with 12 pools of water and with five dancers lying in foetal position in circles of golden light. One man, Ushio Amagatsu, stands erect, dancing like a statue in a zen garden come to life. Then the others rise to perform introvert, repetitive passages of dance. Their hands are clawed, their knees sag, their faces are sternly immobile. The music ranges from harshly amplified strings to lyric piano and churning industrial noise. </p> <p>There are two dramatic changes of gear in the show. One occurs when four dancers appear in corsets and skirts, swarming round one of the pools of water, which has been bloodied with red paint. The men's shaven heads, pallid rice-powdered skins, and narcissistic gestures make them appear like 19th-century courtesans returned from some transsexual limbo. The other climax is a breathtaking light change in which the stage is pooled with gold and aquamarine, and patterned with an extravagant chiaroscuro effect. The dancers, gilded against the deep black of the backdrop, look like gods from another planet. </p> <p>Little else in the show, however, worked any of the predictable Sankai Juku magic on me. I found its repetitions dull rather than focused and I resisted its efforts to nudge me into any contemplation of body, time or spirit. This surliness on my part may have been the fault of the choreography, which possibly had a more limited stock of images than usual, or of the stage design, which, though beautiful, may have been more static. Or it could simply have been that I was so sick of the unrelenting drip of rain outside, that I had no patience for the unchanging theatrical weather inside. Sankai Juku dramatically displace our normal readings of body language and create bizarre, wonderful images, but they expect their audience to fill in an awful lot of the spaces between.

Shares in Agere Systems, the Lucent spin-off, opened up fractionally but only after the company had slashed its offering price to $6 from an earlier range of between $16 and $19. The flotation raised $3.6bn, about half the sum Lucent had originally hoped for. The parent company has already earmarked the funding to repay a massive debt load. The company's prospects were hard hit by the decision of Nortel, Agere's second biggest customer, to issue its second profits warning in a month late on Tuesday. Shares in the Canadian company fell as much as 17% after it further cut revenue and profits estimates. Several analysts downgraded Nortel after it said that its 2001 projections were unreliable and that it would fire an additional 5,000 people by mid-year. The announcement brings the total number of jobs cut at the company to 15,000 jobs this year. Shares in Lucent also fell 13%, close to a four-year low, as a result of the warning and continuing fears over its ability to finance its heavy debt burden. Palm shares almost halved to $8.63 after the company said it expected a loss in the fourth quarter and announced plans to sack 250 workers, or about 15% of its staff.",

The loss of \u00a37.9m and revenues of \u00a32.7m were in line with analyst's revised expectations following a series of profits warnings last year, however. Like many games companies, Rage is experiencing tough times. Shares closed down 1.5p at 5.5p.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Scotland's expectation of surging three points clear in the Group Six table should translate into blitzkrieg tactics from their manager Craig Brown against San Marino tonight, with Matt Elliott moving from defence to join the strikers. </p> <p>Brown is also aware that a rampaging victory at Hampden Park would go some way towards restoring morale after dropping two points against Belgium on Saturday through a stoppage-time equaliser. Goals are imperative tonight following Belgium's 10-1 win over the Sammarinese last month. </p> <p>\"We are really disappointed because we could have been smoking cigars and drinking champagne, but instead we have still got a very, very good chance,\" said Brown. </p> <p>Assuming San Marino will pack their defence and operate with a single striker, Brown will trim his own back division in favour of more attackers. </p> <p>Brown, who has yet to pick his side, added: \"I hope to get some goals but they only lost 1-0 to Latvia in November. So, for Belgium to get 10 was exceptional. If we can get the ball in, then Elliott is the major threat.

      "bodyText": "Scotland's expectation of surging three points clear in the Group Six table should translate into blitzkrieg tactics from their manager Craig Brown against San Marino tonight, with Matt Elliott moving from defence to join the strikers. Brown is also aware that a rampaging victory at Hampden Park would go some way towards restoring morale after dropping two points against Belgium on Saturday through a stoppage-time equaliser. Goals are imperative tonight following Belgium's 10-1 win over the Sammarinese last month. \"We are really disappointed because we could have been smoking cigars and drinking champagne, but instead we have still got a very, very good chance,\" said Brown. Assuming San Marino will pack their defence and operate with a single striker, Brown will trim his own back division in favour of more attackers. Brown, who has yet to pick his side, added: \"I hope to get some goals but they only lost 1-0 to Latvia in November. So, for Belgium to get 10 was exceptional. If we can get the ball in, then Elliott is the major threat. We don't need three centre halves against one striker, put it that way.\" Elliott, a central defender with a penchant for going forward for his club Leicester City, added: \"The ideal way to get over Saturday's result is to bang in a hatful of goals which would go some way to lessening the bad taste of Saturday's result.

      "body": "<p>EU vets have accepted a request by Britain to have the option to use foot and mouth vaccinations in Cumbria and Devon. Officials said that the programme could involve around 180,000 dairy cows in the two regions. The ministry of agriculture announced that legislation to enable these vaccinations is already being drafted.</p> <p>Fears that animals could be buried alive were raised earlier today as the army intensified the mass cull against foot and mouth disease and military butchers joined the front line of the sheep slaughter in Cumbria.</p> <p>Seven butchers from the army catering corps will join a further 13 civilian slaughter workers at the Great Orton airfield site near Carlisle, which is due to receive 2,000 live sheep by this afternoon.</p> <p>However, the RSPCA said it had \"grave concerns\" about many aspects of the escalating slaughter. The RSPCA's chief veterinary officer, Chris Laurence, said: \"Animals must be killed and not simply stunned without any further action to ensure immediate death.</p> <p>\"If the animal's nervous system is not destroyed in a process known as 'pithing' then it is possible the animal could gain some awareness and feel pain.\"</p> <p>This, he said, leads to the potential \"horror scenario\" of animals being put into the burial pits while still having a degree of awareness.</p> <p>The charity wants inspectors to be allowed to oversee the killing, to ensure it is done humanely. Mr Laurence added: \"Ideally, we would want these animals to be killed on the farm where they would be spared the stress of a journey to the burial sites and exposure to an unfamiliar environment.\"</p> <p>Major Guy Richardson stressed that the army butchers were all qualified slaughter workers who would be using conventional culling methods.</p> <p>The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, declared this afternoon that the army was fighting the disease on two fronts.</p> <p>Soldiers on the ground, along with Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food officials, are desperately trying to clear a backlog of outbreaks whilst at the same time constructing a firebreak to prevent further spread of the disease in Cumbria.</p> <p>Mr Hoon said: \"The backlog is obviously a priority as is maintaining the front-line against the disease. The logistical problem is tackling the backlog as well as maintaining a line beyond which we do not want the disease to spread.\"</p> <p>The minister refused to entertain the suggestion that the army's high profile involvement was a tacit recognition that the disease had spiraled out of control.</p> <p>The minister has traveled to Carlisle with the army's commander-in-chief of British land forces, General Sir Michael Jackson, and the pair will be given a guided tour of the operation.</p> <p>General Jackson said: \"It is a rather different sort of conflict. It is not one involving human beings who cannot get on with each other, it is a very tragic disease in our own country.\"</p> <p>The prime minister, Tony Blair, today urged the British public to take the lead by going to the countryside to show the world it was still open for business and help the country's beleaguered tourist industry.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: Increase in cases</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a><br></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463602,00.html\">26.03.2001: Countrytown blues</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html  \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464340,00.html\">28.03.2001: New plan for firewall vaccination</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464312,00.html\">28.03.2001: Illegal meat trail leads to infected countries</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464283,00.html\">28.03.2001: 'They said nothing could be done'</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464337,00.html\">28.03.2001: Ministers failed to heed warnings, experts say</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463679,00.html\">27.03.2001, Matthew Engel: Fiddling facts while we burn</a></p> <p><b>Farmer's diary</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464259,00.html\">28.03.2001: On the farm</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive: foot and mouth in 1967</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\"> 16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463596,00.html\">11.11.1967: Emigrant flights to Australia stopped by foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463559,00.html\">01.11.1967: It is cheaper to kill than to prevent cattle disease</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html  \">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Cartoons</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html\">Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html\">Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681  \">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>NetNotes</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

The RSPCA's chief veterinary officer, Chris Laurence, said: \"Animals must be killed and not simply stunned without any further action to ensure immediate death. \"If the animal's nervous system is not destroyed in a process known as 'pithing' then it is possible the animal could gain some awareness and feel pain.\" This, he said, leads to the potential \"horror scenario\" of animals being put into the burial pits while still having a degree of awareness. The charity wants inspectors to be allowed to oversee the killing, to ensure it is done humanely. Mr Laurence added: \"Ideally, we would want these animals to be killed on the farm where they would be spared the stress of a journey to the burial sites and exposure to an unfamiliar environment.\" Major Guy Richardson stressed that the army butchers were all qualified slaughter workers who would be using conventional culling methods. The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, declared this afternoon that the army was fighting the disease on two fronts. Soldiers on the ground, along with Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food officials, are desperately trying to clear a backlog of outbreaks whilst at the same time constructing a firebreak to prevent further spread of the disease in Cumbria. Mr Hoon said: \"The backlog is obviously a priority as is maintaining the front-line against the disease. The logistical problem is tackling the backlog as well as maintaining a line beyond which we do not want the disease to spread.\" The minister refused to entertain the suggestion that the army's high profile involvement was a tacit recognition that the disease had spiraled out of control. The minister has traveled to Carlisle with the army's commander-in-chief of British land forces, General Sir Michael Jackson, and the pair will be given a guided tour of the operation. General Jackson said: \"It is a rather different sort of conflict. It is not one involving human beings who cannot get on with each other, it is a very tragic disease in our own country.\" The prime minister, Tony Blair, today urged the British public to take the lead by going to the countryside to show the world it was still open for business and help the country's beleaguered tourist industry.

      "bodyText": "The future of Ground Force is banging in the balance after Alan Titchmarsh - middle England's gardening mentor - announced he was quitting the hit BBC show. The star - who also fronts BBC2's Gardener's World - said although he enjoyed the programme he had done enough of them. Titchmarsh will leave after completing the shows to which he has already committed himself. The garden makeover show was launched in 1997 on BBC2 but transferred to BBC1 after it proved to be a huge ratings hit. At its peak two years ago, it was the second best rating BBC show after EastEnders as Titchmarsh and his co-host Charlie Dimmock blossomed in the public's affection. It won over 12m viewers but audiences have since slumped to around 7.5m. And it can no longer claim the place in TV's top 10, slipping to number 16 in the BBC1's top 30 according to the latest official ratings from BARB. Another eight shows are lined up for 2001 and a further eight will be filmed next year. After that Titchmarsh said he will call it a day. \"When we got to 50 programmes I thought that was the time to stop, but they were desperate to carry on. I agreed to do another 16, then I'll go. That's it,\" he said. \"They'll probably bring in somebody else.

I hope it's still giving people a lot of pleasure. It's still in the top 10 - I can't grumble at that.\" His decision could mark the end of gardening's place in the primetime BBC1 schedule. Ground Force's success was due partly to its gameshow feel but TV bosses have been aware for some time that viewers will ultimately tire of it along with other makeover shows such as Changing Rooms. Titchmarsh, also a best-selling novelist, will be fronting the coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show when it returns to BBC2 in May after the event was screened for several years on Channel 4. He said the return to the Beeb would give coverage of the show \"dignity and depth\". A BBC spokeswoman said Mr Titchmarsh would remain one of the key stars of the corporation's gardening output even after he leaves Ground Force in two years time. \"He has just renewed a contract for two years, so viewers can enjoy him on Ground Force for a long time to come.

      "body": "<p>A minor revolution is underway inside the cloistered halls of one of the very grandest of France's \"grandes \u00e9coles\", and it could have some far-reaching consequences in this most elitist of nations.</p> <p>For generations, the Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques - almost universally known as Sciences-Po - in rue Guillaume on the Left Bank has drawn its fortunate students from the smartest lyc\u00e9es of the capital.</p> <p>As a result, more than 80% of them are the sons (and occasionally the daughters) of industrialists, academics, senior management staff or professionals. Rather less than 5% have a parent who is a regular employee or a shopkeeper, still less a manual worker.</p> <p>But the august institution's governing council has just voted, and by a large majority, to sign admission agreements with seven high schools in some of the most run-down and disadvantaged suburbs of Paris.</p> <p>Promising pupils from such dives as Aulnay-sous-Bois and Seine-Saint-Denis will, from this summer, be admitted on the basis of an interview and their school record, rather than on Science-Po's legendary and terrifying entrance exam that until now has been attempted only by students educated in the capital's classiest arrondissements.</p> <p>\"We're doing something concrete to change the way this institution recruits France's academic elite almost exclusively from its social elite, in a self-perpetuating cycle that is both deeply unfair and in the long term, damaging for the nation,\" said Science-Po's courageous director, Richard Descoings.</p> <p>To an even greater extent than Oxford and Cambridge in Britain, Sciences-Po has, along with a handful of other top finishing schools like the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, the Ecole Polytechnique and the mighty Ecole nationale d'administration or ENA, furnished France's governing class for generations.</p> <p>Graduates of the so-called grandes \u00e9coles can expect plum jobs in the civil service, public-sector companies and privatised industry. More than 80% of the country's top technocrats are have been to one or more of these schools, as have half the bosses of France's top 200 companies, three-quarters of prime minister Lionel Jospin's cabinet, six of the past eight prime ministers and two of the past three French presidents.</p> <p>It is a system that has, over the years, supplied France with a reliable pool of top-level talent, able to push through ambitious schemes like the TGV and govern forcefully.

      "bodyText": "A minor revolution is underway inside the cloistered halls of one of the very grandest of France's \"grandes \u00e9coles\", and it could have some far-reaching consequences in this most elitist of nations. For generations, the Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques - almost universally known as Sciences-Po - in rue Guillaume on the Left Bank has drawn its fortunate students from the smartest lyc\u00e9es of the capital. As a result, more than 80% of them are the sons (and occasionally the daughters) of industrialists, academics, senior management staff or professionals. Rather less than 5% have a parent who is a regular employee or a shopkeeper, still less a manual worker. But the august institution's governing council has just voted, and by a large majority, to sign admission agreements with seven high schools in some of the most run-down and disadvantaged suburbs of Paris. Promising pupils from such dives as Aulnay-sous-Bois and Seine-Saint-Denis will, from this summer, be admitted on the basis of an interview and their school record, rather than on Science-Po's legendary and terrifying entrance exam that until now has been attempted only by students educated in the capital's classiest arrondissements. \"We're doing something concrete to change the way this institution recruits France's academic elite almost exclusively from its social elite, in a self-perpetuating cycle that is both deeply unfair and in the long term, damaging for the nation,\" said Science-Po's courageous director, Richard Descoings. To an even greater extent than Oxford and Cambridge in Britain, Sciences-Po has, along with a handful of other top finishing schools like the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, the Ecole Polytechnique and the mighty Ecole nationale d'administration or ENA, furnished France's governing class for generations. Graduates of the so-called grandes \u00e9coles can expect plum jobs in the civil service, public-sector companies and privatised industry. More than 80% of the country's top technocrats are have been to one or more of these schools, as have half the bosses of France's top 200 companies, three-quarters of prime minister Lionel Jospin's cabinet, six of the past eight prime ministers and two of the past three French presidents. It is a system that has, over the years, supplied France with a reliable pool of top-level talent, able to push through ambitious schemes like the TGV and govern forcefully. But it is also a system that has widened social divides, creating a hermetically-sealed caste of mutually self-interested high-flyers who make a sad mockery of the \"equality\" the country boasts of in its national motto. It has been criticised for years; in 1998, Jacques Attali denounced \"a machine for reproducing elites\" and pointed out that it was \"essentially impossible today for a child who has attended a primary school in a disavantaged suburb to ever gain admission to a grande \u00e9cole\". But until this week, no one had tampered with it. So perhaps not surprisingly, Sciences-Po's initiative has not been universally welcomed. The directors of the other fast-breeders for bureaucrats have denounced it as an empty gesture, claiming their schools' privileged intakes simply reflect the structure of French society, and that it's not down to them to change that. Some Sciences-Po students have even threatened to take the governors to court, arguing that by creating a two-stream admission procedure the school is effectively discriminating against its more traditional candidates. But the initiative has been enthusiastically welcomed by the Socialist education minister, Jack Lang, who says he is committed to achieving a higher education system \"based on both equality of access and intellectual rigour\" and that he sincerely hopes Science-Po's move will be emulated by France's other elitist institutions. \"We no longer have the right, in France, to maintain this ossified system,\" the minister said. \"Cultural diversity will enrich every student, and finally lead us to question an abnormal and outmoded system in which the country's decision-makers all emerge from the same mould.\" Whether or not it is copied, Science-Po's daring adventure in democracy should be applauded, and loudly. In a country that is changing faster than its self-satisfied governing class sometimes seems to realise, it is yet another sign that the country is no longer trying to seek refuge from the present in the certainties of the past.

      "body": "<p>A lesbian teacher forced out of her job by a \"campaign of harassment\" by pupils sought a ruling from the court of appeal yesterday that she was entitled to compensation as a victim of sex discrimination. </p> <p>Shirley Pearce took her case to the appeal court after rulings from an industrial tribunal and the employment appeal tribunal that she had suffered homophobic abuse not because she was a woman but because she was gay, and her case was therefore not covered by the Sex Discrimination Act. </p> <p>Her appeal is a test of whether the Human Rights Act, which came into force six months ago, makes it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation. </p> <p>The school is represented by Cherie Booth QC, who is expected to argue today that the harassment Ms Pearce was subjected to was based on her sexual orientation, not her sex, and that she was not discriminated against because a gay man would have been treated no differently. </p> <p>Laura Cox QC, for the teacher, told Lords Justices Henry and Judge and Lady Justice Hale that claims for injury to feelings in sex discrimination cases resulted in awards \"at the highest level\". But her client had been denied compensation because the tribunals had been decided she had not been treated differently from a gay man. Ms Cox argued that the definition of \"sex\" in the act should include \"sexuality\" or \"sexual orientation\". </p> <p>Ms Pearce, 53, was a science teacher at Mayfield secondary in Portsmouth. She was subjected to substantial sexual harassment for five years, an employment tribunal found in 1997. Ms Cox said: \"That caused her such distress and hurt that she became unwell and had to take early health retirement.\" </p> <p>She said the tribunal had found the school's response to pupils' conduct \"unrealistic, cavalier and dismissive\" and the head's attitude \"appalling\". </p> <p>She added: \"The appellant's complaint was of direct sex discrimination but the employment tribunal dismissed the complaint. She could not succeed because she had not demonstrated that a gay man would not have been subjected to abuse of the same kind.\" </p> <p>Ms Cox said the tribunal and then the appeal tribunal had \"failed to approach the issue correctly, by concentrating on the applicant's sexuality or orientation and lost sight of the fact that the appellant was a woman\". The QC said that if the discrimination act did not protect a lesbian it would be incompatible with the rights act, which guarantees freedom of expression and respect for private life for all. </p> <p>\"This was homophobic abuse, in the school and outside her home, by individuals and groups shouting out. We know it affected the appellant's physical and psychological identity, and she could not carry on working. The school was well aware of the extent of the harassment.\" </p> <p>The appeal tribunal, when it dismissed Ms Pearce's appeal last March, said that it felt very considerable sympathy for her, but thought it to be \"counterproductive to bend an existing law into something which it is not\". </p> <p>It suggested the position might be different once the rights act came in force.</p>",

Shirley Pearce took her case to the appeal court after rulings from an industrial tribunal and the employment appeal tribunal that she had suffered homophobic abuse not because she was a woman but because she was gay, and her case was therefore not covered by the Sex Discrimination Act. Her appeal is a test of whether the Human Rights Act, which came into force six months ago, makes it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation. The school is represented by Cherie Booth QC, who is expected to argue today that the harassment Ms Pearce was subjected to was based on her sexual orientation, not her sex, and that she was not discriminated against because a gay man would have been treated no differently. Laura Cox QC, for the teacher, told Lords Justices Henry and Judge and Lady Justice Hale that claims for injury to feelings in sex discrimination cases resulted in awards \"at the highest level\". But her client had been denied compensation because the tribunals had been decided she had not been treated differently from a gay man. Ms Cox argued that the definition of \"sex\" in the act should include \"sexuality\" or \"sexual orientation\". Ms Pearce, 53, was a science teacher at Mayfield secondary in Portsmouth. She was subjected to substantial sexual harassment for five years, an employment tribunal found in 1997. Ms Cox said: \"That caused her such distress and hurt that she became unwell and had to take early health retirement.\" She said the tribunal had found the school's response to pupils' conduct \"unrealistic, cavalier and dismissive\" and the head's attitude \"appalling\". She added: \"The appellant's complaint was of direct sex discrimination but the employment tribunal dismissed the complaint. She could not succeed because she had not demonstrated that a gay man would not have been subjected to abuse of the same kind.\" Ms Cox said the tribunal and then the appeal tribunal had \"failed to approach the issue correctly, by concentrating on the applicant's sexuality or orientation and lost sight of the fact that the appellant was a woman\". The QC said that if the discrimination act did not protect a lesbian it would be incompatible with the rights act, which guarantees freedom of expression and respect for private life for all. \"This was homophobic abuse, in the school and outside her home, by individuals and groups shouting out. We know it affected the appellant's physical and psychological identity, and she could not carry on working. The school was well aware of the extent of the harassment.\" The appeal tribunal, when it dismissed Ms Pearce's appeal last March, said that it felt very considerable sympathy for her, but thought it to be \"counterproductive to bend an existing law into something which it is not\". It suggested the position might be different once the rights act came in force.",

      "bodyText": "Top NHS and local government managers should be paid \"substantial\" bonuses to bring their salaries closer to private sector levels, a new report endorsed by the prime minister recommends. The report from the Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) - a Cabinet Office-based think-tank - suggests the move could help local government recruit and retain the best senior staff, as well as making it easier for employees to move between sectors. The PIU suggests this could be done with large bonuses for successful managers, or by raising wages selectively when it is necessary to recruit staff. Welcoming the report, the prime minister, Tony Blair, said: \"I value the tremendous job being done by leaders in our hospitals and schools, local authorities and elsewhere. But I want to see more being done to develop and support effective leadership across the public sector as a whole.\" The PIU says the public sector has problems recruiting and retaining the best leaders, but rejects \"magic solutions\" to the problem, such as the wholesale import of senior private sector staff. Instead, its recommendations, which are likely to shape government policy, focus on a \"new deal\" for public service leaders. The programme of change would ensure that high-level jobs give employees transferable management skills, promote good working conditions and place a new emphasis on involving leaders in the policy-making process. The unit wants a high-profile group of public managers put together to champion careers in the sector, and says the government should consider an award scheme to recognise outstanding leadership. The unit says ministers need to consider more carefully whether their policies are likely to constrain the ability of top managers to effectively lead the public sector. In a paper published alongside its leadership report, the PIU goes further, rejecting the government's increasingly centralist approach to delivering services: \"Delivery of public services always depends on the actions of people and institutions that cannot be directly controlled by central government departments and agencies.\" \"Although short-term results can be achieved through direction, in the long-run it is more efficient and effective to motivate and empower than to issue detailed commands.\" The local government Improvement and Development Agency today welcomed the leadership research. Director John O'Brien said: \"We would support the thrust about leadership being critical It's positive that we're talking about issues like cross-sectoral leadership.\" The report explored issues across the whole range of public services, but focuses particularly on health, local government and education.",

      "bodyText": "There's a new manufactured pop act in town but this time, every single thing about the artist is manufactured. Tmmy, pronounced Timmy, has all the right ingredients to become a pop sensation - good looks, angelic voice, big boobs and a gritty determination to succeed. At least that's what her CV says. But there's only one catch - she won't be able to do live performances or interviews as she is what is now commonly referred to as a cyberbabe. Created by the same company behind Ananova, 21-year-old Tmmy releases her first single at the end of May but if you can't wait until then, a sneak preview of her first song, You Make My Day, is available on her official website, Tmmy.co.uk She studied media at college, and aims to have a number-one hit and play the Glastonbury Festival. Digital Animations Group, the company behind Tmmy, have even given her characteristics and set goals. She dreams of a number one single and of touring the world but would love to appear on Vets in Practice or Pet Rescue, or failing that become a VJ on MTV. At college Tmmy studied media and travelled during her summer holidays where she perfected both French and German, which of course she speaks fluently. Pundits expect her to give Popstars's manufactured band Hear'Say a run for their money. Useful link Tmmy.co.uk",

When asked this afternoon about the issue by the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, Mr Blair said it was both morally right and in Britain's self-interest to support racial equality. He added: \"Most people have blood from other races and countries in us.\" Today Guardian Unlimited additionally revealed that the Mr Townend was the only MP to refuse to sign a Commission for Racial Equality pledge card to not use race as an issue during the election campaign. Although the prime minister did not refer to Mr Townend by name, his comments added to the groundswell of criticism of the veteran hard-right MP. Council, church and community leaders today queued up to condemn retiring MP's speech. Ross Willmott, Leicester city council leader, said: \"His comments undermine good race relations in Leicester. \"Its an affront to this city, particularly in the run up to a general election.

      "body": "<p>More than 30 people, including a 13-year-old boy and a man working for a national youth organisation, were arrested yesterday in dawn raids on the homes of suspected paedophiles who collect and distribute obscene computer images of children. </p> <p>Twenty-five forces in England, Scotland and Wales took part in the operation, codenamed Appal and coordinated by Greater Manchester police. The move followed a four-month investigation by the force into paedophile activity on the internet during which officers observed, but did not take part in, sessions on dedicated chat channels. </p> <p>More than 40 homes, from the north of Scotland to Dorset, were raided and computer equipment seized as Manchester officers warned those trading in the images - many of which showed children being abused - that they would be tracked down and charged. </p> <p>\"People have referred to this as the dark side of the internet,\" said Med Hughes, Manchester's assistant chief constable. \"We are going to shine a beam of light into that, start opening up that world and prosecuting those responsible.\" </p> <p>The Manchester force, which has a long-established obscene publications unit, with a staff of six, has linked up with SurfControl, a private company specialising in responsible internet use. </p> <p>After a chance viewing of a TV programme about the unit, SurfControl made available to officers new software that dramatically increased the speed with which alleged offenders could be tracked down. Previously 60 staff hours spent on internet checks would produce 16 suspects; now 16 hours can produce 60 suspects. </p> <p>\"We are out there watching them,\" said Mr Hughes. \"We have the tools to identify them and will root out paedophiles and those who like collections of indecent images of children. We'll come looking for them, and deal with them. </p> <p>\"Partnerships [with commercial companies] are a major issue in dealing with the menace of child pornography on the internet.\" He added that the computer industry had a responsibility for \"unlawful activity\". </p> <p>The 13-year-old was arrested in Manchester and an 18-year-old man was held in Swansea. \"A 13-year-old involved in this is potentially a victim as well as an offender,\" Mr Hughes said. </p> <p>Manchester officers made two arrests in the Rochdale and Moston areas. </p> <p>A man from Stretford, south of the city centre, was arrested before Operation Appal began because it was believed he posed a significant threat to children to whom he had access. </p> <p>Terry Jones, an inspector of the force's obscene publications unit, said those who traded in computer images would find it increasingly difficult to hide from the police. \"Our work identifies those people abusing one of the most vulnerable groups in our society,\" he said. \"We will continue to track down those individuals who believe the internet gives them the anonymity to continue their trade in obscene pictures.\" </p> <p>He added that areas of the net were \"fairly clearly marked\" to show that discussions would centre on paedophile activity. \"People are now sharing this awful material and that gives us the opportunity to highlight those who may be a danger to society,\" he said. </p> <p>In 1999, the force's unit made the first successful identification of an offender and a victim from abuse images seen on the net. A man was later jailed for 12 years for offences which included the rape of a child aged four. The unit also coordinated two operations in which 44 suspects involved in the distribution of indecent images of children were identified across the country. </p> <p>In 1998, officers raided the Stockport home of Gary Salt and found 42,000 child sex images on a computer. The arrest of Salt, who was later jailed for 12 years, helped to unmask the members of the Wonderland Club, a worldwide internet paedophile ring. Seven British members of the ring were jailed last month.</p>",

More than 40 homes, from the north of Scotland to Dorset, were raided and computer equipment seized as Manchester officers warned those trading in the images - many of which showed children being abused - that they would be tracked down and charged. \"People have referred to this as the dark side of the internet,\" said Med Hughes, Manchester's assistant chief constable. \"We are going to shine a beam of light into that, start opening up that world and prosecuting those responsible.\" The Manchester force, which has a long-established obscene publications unit, with a staff of six, has linked up with SurfControl, a private company specialising in responsible internet use. After a chance viewing of a TV programme about the unit, SurfControl made available to officers new software that dramatically increased the speed with which alleged offenders could be tracked down. Previously 60 staff hours spent on internet checks would produce 16 suspects; now 16 hours can produce 60 suspects. \"We are out there watching them,\" said Mr Hughes. \"We have the tools to identify them and will root out paedophiles and those who like collections of indecent images of children. We'll come looking for them, and deal with them. \"Partnerships [with commercial companies] are a major issue in dealing with the menace of child pornography on the internet.\" He added that the computer industry had a responsibility for \"unlawful activity\". The 13-year-old was arrested in Manchester and an 18-year-old man was held in Swansea. \"A 13-year-old involved in this is potentially a victim as well as an offender,\" Mr Hughes said. Manchester officers made two arrests in the Rochdale and Moston areas. A man from Stretford, south of the city centre, was arrested before Operation Appal began because it was believed he posed a significant threat to children to whom he had access. Terry Jones, an inspector of the force's obscene publications unit, said those who traded in computer images would find it increasingly difficult to hide from the police. \"Our work identifies those people abusing one of the most vulnerable groups in our society,\" he said. \"We will continue to track down those individuals who believe the internet gives them the anonymity to continue their trade in obscene pictures.\" He added that areas of the net were \"fairly clearly marked\" to show that discussions would centre on paedophile activity. \"People are now sharing this awful material and that gives us the opportunity to highlight those who may be a danger to society,\" he said. In 1999, the force's unit made the first successful identification of an offender and a victim from abuse images seen on the net. A man was later jailed for 12 years for offences which included the rape of a child aged four. The unit also coordinated two operations in which 44 suspects involved in the distribution of indecent images of children were identified across the country. In 1998, officers raided the Stockport home of Gary Salt and found 42,000 child sex images on a computer. The arrest of Salt, who was later jailed for 12 years, helped to unmask the members of the Wonderland Club, a worldwide internet paedophile ring. Seven British members of the ring were jailed last month.",

What is less widely understood is the link between diminishing global biodiversity and the disappearance of languages. </p>While new trees can be planted and habitats restored, it is much more difficult to restore languages once they have been murdered. And languages are being murdered today faster than ever before in human history. Even the most optimistic prognoses claim that only half of today's 6,000-7,000 spoken languages will exist by 2100. The media and educational systems are the most important direct agents in language murder today. Most of the world's languages are spoken by relatively few people; the median number of speakers of a language is probably 5,000-6,000. There are fewer than 300 languages with more than 1m native users; half of all languages have fewer than 10,000 users, and a quarter of the world's spoken languages and most of the sign languages have fewer than 1,000 users. More than 80% of the world's languages exist in one country only. A simple comparison, based on numbers and extinction rates, shows that linguistic diversity (LD) is disappearing relatively much faster than biodiversity (BD). Optimistic estimates claim that 2% of biological species but 50% of languages may be dead or moribund - no longer learned by children - in 100 years' time. According to pessimistic but realistic estimates, 20% of biological species but 90% of languages may be dead or moribund in 100 years. People might say: so what? It might be better for world peace if we all speak a few big languages and understand each other. But language diversity is decisive for the future of the planet. LD and BD are correlated: where one type is high, the other one is too, and vice versa, even if there are exceptions. David Harmon of Terralingua, an international non-profit organisation devoted to preserving the world's linguistic diversity, has compared the 25 countries that have the most endemic languages with the 25 that have the most higher vertebrates. Sixteen countries (64%) are on both lists. According to Harmon, \"it is very unlikely that this would only be accidental\". He gets the same results with flowering plants and languages, butterflies and languages - a high correlation between countries with biological and linguistic megadiversity. New research shows mounting evidence that the relationship may also be causal: the two types of diversities seem to enforce and support each other. According to a recent United Nations environmental programme report, threatened languages store the knowledge about how to maintain and use sustainably some of the most vulnerable and most biologically diverse environments in the world. It has taken centuries for people to learn about their environments and to name the complex ecological relationships that are decisive for maintenance of biodiversity. When indigenous peoples lose their languages, much of this knowledge also disappears: the dominant languages do not have the ethno-biological and ethno-medical vocabulary, and the stories will not be translated. If the long-lasting co-evolution that people have had with their environments is suddenly disrupted, without nature (and people) having enough time to adjust and adapt, we can expect a catastrophe. If during the next 100 years we murder up to 90% of the linguistic (and thereby mostly also the cultural) diversity that is our treasury of this historically developed ecological knowledge, we are also seriously undermining our chances of life on Earth. Like the loss of BD, the loss of LD is dangerous reductionism. As we see in increasingly dramatic ways, such as the spread of species that are more resistant to antibiotics and herbicides, monocultures are vulnerable. The potential for the new lateral thinking that might save us from ourselves in time lies in having as many and as diverse languages and cultures as possible. We do not know which ones have the right medicine. For this, multilingualism is necessary. Indigenous and minority people need to have a chance to maintain their own languages and learn dominant languages. But instead of fostering and supporting multilingualism through the education system, schools participate in linguistic genocide, as it has been defined in the United Nations Genocide Convention (Articles IIb and IIe and its Final Draft Article III1). Pirjo Janulf shows in a recent study that of those Finnish immigrant minority members in Sweden who had had Swedish-medium education, not one spoke any Finnish to his or her own children. Even if these adults might not have forgotten their Finnish completely, their children were forcibly transferred to the majority group, at least linguistically. This is what happens to millions of speakers of threatened languages all over the world. There are no schools or classes teaching through the medium of the threatened indigenous or minority languages. The transfer to the majority language group is not voluntary: alternatives do not exist, and parents do not have enough reliable information about the long-term consequences of the various choices. There is also a wealth of research and statistics about the mental harm that forced assimilation causes in education and other areas. To stop linguistic genocide, linguistic human rights in education need to be respected. The most important linguistic human right for maintenance of LD is the right to mother-tongue medium education. But the existing and draft human rights instruments are completely insufficient in protecting linguistic human rights in education. When speakers of small languages learn other, necessary, languages in addition to their native languages, they become multilingual, and the maintenance of LD, necessary for the planet, is supported. When dominant languages such as English are learned subtractively, at the cost of the mother tongues, they become killer languages. The task for users of English is to stop it being a killer language and change it to an additive asset.

Despite her shellshock, she kept the date and made it through to the last session. A child stood up and asked about Wilson's The Suitcase Kid, which tells the story of a child who moves between parents, a week with mum, a week with dad. </p> <p>\"Has your marriage split up?\" the little girl asked Wilson. This wasn't the first time children had asked this sort of question. Wilson is often asked, bemusingly enough for this tiny woman in her mid-50s, whether Marigold - of the tattoos, chequered love life, mental health problems and drinking habit - from her book The Illustrated Mum is based on herself. </p> <p>Wilson took a deep breath, determined to do the professional thing: give a straight question a straight answer. \"Funnily, yes,\" she said. \"But not when I actually wrote the book.\" </p> <p>\"Never mind, Jacqueline,\" the little girl told the bestselling author. \"You've got more time to write your books now!\" </p> <p>\"I thought, 'You wonderful, lovely child,' \" Wilson tells me, sitting in the juice bar of a big London bookshop, her favourite meeting place in town. \"I'm not sentimental about children, but, for the most part, they are so kind - as long as you're reasonably straightforward with them.\" </p> <p>Wilson was writing about divorce long before her own. Her daughter was in her late 20s when Wilson's marriage ended; by coincidence, Wilson's own parents split up when she was in her 20s. </p> <p>She does not see a parallel, though. \"We were reasonably cosy as a family,\" she says of her 30-year marriage. \"My parents were not cosy as a family at all. They were never happy, and had frequently gone their own ways.\" </p> <p>Wilson is on tour publicising her latest book, The Cat Mummy. She has cropped grey hair, lacy black clothes and lots of elaborate jewellery; when she was a child, her mother always put her in velour coats, little hats and absolutely no jewellery. She has been writing novels since her teens, including more than 50 children's books. </p> <p>Lately, her career has taken on the kind of proportions that would give Hear'Say a run for their money. Fans are queueing for up to five hours at book signings, and 10-year-old girls burst into tears. \"I'm just so excited,\" one child wailed. Wilson's Double Act is being filmed for TV, and Tiger Aspect, the company that made Billy Elliot, is working on The Suitcase Kid. </p> <p>Wilson's brand of fiction tackles death, divorce and manic depression, as managed by children, all written in a chatty, down-to-earth style. If you're a woman in your 30s, and this straight-dealing with personal issues sounds familiar - like a magazine you once read - it is no coincidence. </p> <p>Wilson left school at 16; not because she was bullied, as so many of her characters are, but because she was \"too bolshie\" and didn't like being told what to do. She answered an advert in the London Evening Standard looking for teenage writers. </p> <p>The employer was DC Thomson, which was planning a magazine for adolescent girls. Casting around for a good name, the company's two managing directors noticed the new kid in her trendy clothes from London and Jackie magazine was given its name. \"I wasn't trendy,\" she laughs. \"I was shy, from the suburbs, but they were doughty Scots in their 60s.\" </p> <p>Wilson married at 19, and her daughter was born when she was 21. She wrote every minute she could, managing 2,000 words daily just during nursery hours. In the 70s she wrote a series of detective stories, which she is fiercely resisting her publisher's desire to reissue: \"They were probably slightly more sexually explicit than I'd care to write nowadays. Occasionally, librarians pull them out and I have to whisk them away and say, 'No, no, no, these aren't suitable for the children.' \" </p> <p>Wilson strikes one as a fizzy mix of the reassuringly prim and proper and the anarchic - a spiky-haired Mrs Pepperpot. It's a style that works brilliantly with children, while leaving grown-ups a little unsure of their ground. A headteacher I know deplores Wilson's subject matter; but, in the flesh, Wilson could not be more protective of young children's sensibilities. </p> <p>At school, her English teacher was always telling her she was far too colloquial and used too much slang. I told Wilson of the 10-year-old girls I know who imitate their favourite writer and get the comment in red ink: \"Too chatty!\" Wilson says she, too, has been sent some work marked: \"Too Jacqueline Wilson-y!\" Still bolshie, she laughs heartily. </p> <p><strong>The Guardian/BOL short story competition</strong></p> <p>The Guardian Parents page has joined the online entertainment and media retailer BOL to promote a competition, devised by Jacqueline Wilson, for children to write their own short story. </p> <p>To enter, first go to <a href=\"http://www.bol.com\">BOL</a> to read a new story by Wilson and discover her tips for aspiring writers.

      "body": "<p>\"It's so cold on the streets and so frightening,\" says Marie, a 20-year-old student who ran away from a Birmingham care home just before she was 16. She felt that she had no choice but to run away because the stepfather who had sexually abused her as a child, which led to her going into care in the first place, kept following her. He would appear and sit next to her as she sat on the bus to school, and hang around the care home. </p> <p>\"When I was 12 he was jailed for the abuse for a while, but it was all over the papers and everyone knew what he had done to me,\" she says. \"In the end, I couldn't stand it and felt the only thing I could do was run away.\" </p> <p>She finished her GCSEs, took a job washing up in a restaurant for three weeks to save enough money for a train ticket to London, and then ran. </p> <p>\"The worst thing was that no one would listen to me,\" she recalls. \"I was scared and nervous when I got on the train, but I felt I couldn't go back to the situation I had left behind. Kids will only run away if the situation they are in is so bad that living on the streets seems like a better option. Something has got to be really wrong to make a young person do a thing like that.\" </p> <p>Marie was so terrified when she arrived at Euston station that she simply walked the streets for three days - too frightened of what might happen if she lay down and closed her eyes. \"I felt so alone in the world,\" she says. \"Nobody in my care home bothered to report me missing. The streets are full of homeless young people crying out for love.\" </p> <p>Marie was one of an estimated 129,000 young people who run away each year. The commonest reasons for children taking flight include desperation at not being listened to, rows with parents over the amount of freedom they are allowed, bullying at school, and drug problems or abuse at home. </p> <p>A new paper from the Social Exclusion Unit, Consultation on Young Runaways, highlights the problem and puts a variety of solutions to the problem out to consultation. By the age of 16, one in nine children will have run away for at least one night, with a quarter of those ending up sleeping rough. Some have to survive through begging, stealing or prostitution, and many are sexually abused on the streets. </p> <p>While children like Marie, who have been in care, make up a large proportion of runaways (approximately four in 10), the report finds that 21% are fleeing stepfamilies, and 13% one-parent families, compared to 7% who live with both birth parents. But, contrary to stereotype, poverty was found not to be a significant factor leading to young people running away: those from leafy suburbs are just as likely to flee as those from deprived inner-city areas. The majority of runaways are aged between 13 and 16 and are more likely to be girls than boys (although boys tend to run away earlier and more often). It is not only a problem of troubled adolescence: an estimated 18,000 children under 11 also run away each year, of whom about a third are under eight. Shockingly, a further 18,000 children a year are thrown out by their parents. The report also notes that the longer runaways are away, the more vulnerable they become. </p> <p>There is no national network of services in place, so emergency organisations like Childline find it very hard to refer children who phone in a crisis to appropriate local services. The report proposes a series of measures both to prevent young people from running away in the first place, and to provide decent support services when they do. </p> <p>Plans include an interview for each young person who has run away to identify the reasons for fleeing, and to try to tackle them rather than just dumping the children back in the situation from which they have fled; a network of refuges so that young people are not forced to live rough; and the establishment of a named person in each area to co-ordinate services for runaways. </p> <p>Chris, now 20, ran away from numerous care placements about 20 times. He believes that refuges are essential, but also that fundamental changes in the care system are necessary. \"I was frightened on the streets,\" he recalls, \"but I also felt free. I shoplifted to survive. I received no support in care. Nobody listened and I was bullied. For me, living on the streets was better than that.\" </p> <p>Much of the data in the government's new report comes from research carried out by the Children's Society, which has been working with young runaways for the past 20 years. The charity's Penny Dean welcomed the report, but is urging the government to implement some of the proposals - such as providing children with interviews - right away rather than await the outcome of the three-month consultation process. A Social Exclusion Unit spokesman has responded that this would not be possible. </p> <p>\"I really hope the government won't delay over this,\" says Dean. \"Young runaways are a very hard to reach group who need a lot of support. A lot of these young people view statutory agencies with mistrust, and we need a mechanism to draw together expertise from the voluntary sector to deliver the services young people want.\" </p> <p>She condemns the lack of funding for refuges - Centrepoint in London is the only one in Britain - and argues that, although the concept of children's refuges was established in the 1989 Children Act, the money to run them has not been forthcoming from the government. Without such refuges, there is no safety net to protect children from the dangers of the streets. Besides the government recommendations, the Children's Society is calling for more early intervention to prevent running away; support and mediation for parents and children where families have divorced, separated or reformed, and more ethnically sensitive services. </p> <p>Dorit Braun, of Parentline Plus, expresses concern about the number of children who run away from stepfamilies. Jealousy of a parent's new partner can fuel conflict between children and adults in stepfamilies, she says. \"Many children do adjust well, but a small minority don't. The young people and the adults in a stepfamily need to be given time to understand each other. The dynamics of a stepfamily are much more complex than those in an intact family, and stepparents can be viewed by children as interfering and making a difficult situation worse.\" </p> <p>The government has highlighted a small project in Gloucester called Astra (Alternative Solutions to Running Away), which employs just three part-time workers, as a model of good practice. The project works with young people who have run away to prevent recurrences. Staff listen to young people's concerns and then try to work with them, their parents and other agencies (such as schools and social services) to find solutions with which both the young people and their parents or carers are happy. Police estimate that the project has reduced the number of repeat runaways by 61%. </p> <p>One former runaway, Sally, 14, says the project has helped her resolve a difficult situation with her mother: \"My mum didn't like my friends, the way I dressed or the fact that I wore make-up, and she didn't like me going out. One day, I just didn't go home from school. I was scared because I didn't know where I could go. In the end, I stayed at a friend's house. Astra talked to my mum and talked to me. Now she gives me a bit more freedom, I understand her better and she understands me better.\" </p> <p>Now that Marie is settled in London, studying for a university degree and living in a flat that a Children's Society-supported tenancy project helped to secure for her, the days of trudging around the capital's West End with nowhere to go seem very far off. </p> <p>\"I love my home,\" she says. \"I've got my own front room, my own bedroom, a cat, friends and a normal life. I don't ever want to go through what I went through again. And if young people like me had more rights, they wouldn't have to either.\"</p>",

A new paper from the Social Exclusion Unit, Consultation on Young Runaways, highlights the problem and puts a variety of solutions to the problem out to consultation. By the age of 16, one in nine children will have run away for at least one night, with a quarter of those ending up sleeping rough. Some have to survive through begging, stealing or prostitution, and many are sexually abused on the streets. While children like Marie, who have been in care, make up a large proportion of runaways (approximately four in 10), the report finds that 21% are fleeing stepfamilies, and 13% one-parent families, compared to 7% who live with both birth parents. But, contrary to stereotype, poverty was found not to be a significant factor leading to young people running away: those from leafy suburbs are just as likely to flee as those from deprived inner-city areas. The majority of runaways are aged between 13 and 16 and are more likely to be girls than boys (although boys tend to run away earlier and more often). It is not only a problem of troubled adolescence: an estimated 18,000 children under 11 also run away each year, of whom about a third are under eight. Shockingly, a further 18,000 children a year are thrown out by their parents. The report also notes that the longer runaways are away, the more vulnerable they become. There is no national network of services in place, so emergency organisations like Childline find it very hard to refer children who phone in a crisis to appropriate local services. The report proposes a series of measures both to prevent young people from running away in the first place, and to provide decent support services when they do. Plans include an interview for each young person who has run away to identify the reasons for fleeing, and to try to tackle them rather than just dumping the children back in the situation from which they have fled; a network of refuges so that young people are not forced to live rough; and the establishment of a named person in each area to co-ordinate services for runaways. Chris, now 20, ran away from numerous care placements about 20 times. He believes that refuges are essential, but also that fundamental changes in the care system are necessary. \"I was frightened on the streets,\" he recalls, \"but I also felt free. I shoplifted to survive. I received no support in care. Nobody listened and I was bullied. For me, living on the streets was better than that.\" Much of the data in the government's new report comes from research carried out by the Children's Society, which has been working with young runaways for the past 20 years. The charity's Penny Dean welcomed the report, but is urging the government to implement some of the proposals - such as providing children with interviews - right away rather than await the outcome of the three-month consultation process. A Social Exclusion Unit spokesman has responded that this would not be possible. \"I really hope the government won't delay over this,\" says Dean. \"Young runaways are a very hard to reach group who need a lot of support. A lot of these young people view statutory agencies with mistrust, and we need a mechanism to draw together expertise from the voluntary sector to deliver the services young people want.\" She condemns the lack of funding for refuges - Centrepoint in London is the only one in Britain - and argues that, although the concept of children's refuges was established in the 1989 Children Act, the money to run them has not been forthcoming from the government. Without such refuges, there is no safety net to protect children from the dangers of the streets. Besides the government recommendations, the Children's Society is calling for more early intervention to prevent running away; support and mediation for parents and children where families have divorced, separated or reformed, and more ethnically sensitive services. Dorit Braun, of Parentline Plus, expresses concern about the number of children who run away from stepfamilies. Jealousy of a parent's new partner can fuel conflict between children and adults in stepfamilies, she says. \"Many children do adjust well, but a small minority don't. The young people and the adults in a stepfamily need to be given time to understand each other. The dynamics of a stepfamily are much more complex than those in an intact family, and stepparents can be viewed by children as interfering and making a difficult situation worse.\" The government has highlighted a small project in Gloucester called Astra (Alternative Solutions to Running Away), which employs just three part-time workers, as a model of good practice. The project works with young people who have run away to prevent recurrences. Staff listen to young people's concerns and then try to work with them, their parents and other agencies (such as schools and social services) to find solutions with which both the young people and their parents or carers are happy. Police estimate that the project has reduced the number of repeat runaways by 61%. One former runaway, Sally, 14, says the project has helped her resolve a difficult situation with her mother: \"My mum didn't like my friends, the way I dressed or the fact that I wore make-up, and she didn't like me going out. One day, I just didn't go home from school. I was scared because I didn't know where I could go. In the end, I stayed at a friend's house. Astra talked to my mum and talked to me. Now she gives me a bit more freedom, I understand her better and she understands me better.\" Now that Marie is settled in London, studying for a university degree and living in a flat that a Children's Society-supported tenancy project helped to secure for her, the days of trudging around the capital's West End with nowhere to go seem very far off. \"I love my home,\" she says. \"I've got my own front room, my own bedroom, a cat, friends and a normal life. I don't ever want to go through what I went through again. And if young people like me had more rights, they wouldn't have to either.\"",

While most parents fondly foresee their children becoming rocket scientists, professional footballers or virtuoso violinists, my burning ambition was to turn them into beach bums. I was intent on passing on the baton of my own frustrated surfing fantasies. </p> <p>Born in east London, I grew up dreaming of giant waves flattening the capital, drowning teachers and relatives alike, while I alone surfed away to freedom atop a passing tree. It was a bitter day for me when they installed the Thames flood barrier. So it was that I married an Australian (who had gone to the irresistibly named City Beach High School) and went on a surfing honeymoon, scouring every west coast in Europe that was accessible to a Golf GTi for unattainable perfection. We kept the marriage a dark secret from fellow wave aficionados, since it was written in the surfing bible that thou shalt not marry. But there are limits to the principle of deniability: having children is one of them. </p> <p>I remember when our first son was born: it was a big winter in Hawaii. It always is. And I was stuck in England. I began to see the surfing bible's point. Fatherhood and surfing, the dude and the dad, seemed tragically incompatible. We named him Spencer after the number-one surfer in England. Jack was born two winters later. Determined to stick to my own bachelor-born agenda, I kept sneaking off to the North Shore of Oahu and hanging out with the parentally challenged big-wave crew over there, but with a nagging sense of guilt. Not to mention the growing self-critical suspicion that I was never going to make it as a full-on, hardcore surfer. Maybe I had started too late or - perish the thought - I was just not cool enough. </p> <p>Then I had my revelation: kids were not a problem, they were a solution. They could live the dream for me, while I bathed in their reflected glory. I saw myself doing for surfing what Richard Williams - the father of Venus and Serena - had done for tennis: manufacturing a couple of supercool wave-riding prodigies. I bought them their first baggy boardshorts, packed extra sunblock and took them off to Hawaii with me. </p> <p>They were seven and five. It was not too late for their initiation. They swam in deep and devious currents and started to take note of the rhythm of the ocean, to feel the pulse of the planet. They became dedicated wave-watchers at Sunset and Pipeline beaches. Big Wednesday, January 28 1998, when the biggest swell for 30 years hit the North Shore, miraculously coincided with their last day in the islands. The most epic sports contest in the world - the Quiksilver Eddie Aikau big-wave event, which only takes place when the surf hits a 20ft minimum - was called on, then called off again. It was just too damn big, even for Waimea Bay, the ultimate wave coliseum. But the little dudes were able to watch with me, transfixed on the beach at Log Cabins, as an elite corps of tow-in specialists hitched a ride aboard massive thundering smokers bigger than behemoths and beyond awesome. </p> <p>They were hooked. After this surfeit of man-eating 40-footers, maybe it was not surprising that Spencer was so willing to enrol for surf lifesaving classes (\"nipper division\") in Australia. In fact, he had to be reassured that the summer surf in Perth rarely broke the 2ft barrier and the chances of a rogue monster rearing up on the horizon were minimal. Spencer was soon regularly catching waves, kneeling on his \"foamy\" (an elementary surfboard). </p> <p>It wasn't until last summer that my future would-be surf god officially mastered the art. He graduated with flying colours from the O'Neill Surf Academy in Croyde Bay, Devon. Unlike Hawaii, the north shore of Devon was not being pounded by an epic all-time swell. It was a doddle to a boy with Spencer's credentials. My first sustained attempt to conquer the ocean wave in Bali, many years before, ended with me being skewered on rocks. Spencer, in contrast, threw himself into the foam with complete confidence, overseen and assisted by Team O'Neill. On his very first wave he was up and riding. His second was a clean, unbroken wall. His third he rode all the way into the beach, with flawless balance and style. The training had paid off. I looked on with a mix of pride and jealousy. I had always wanted Spencer to be a better surfer than I am - but not necessarily that much better quite so soon. </p> <p>When an old American surfing friend of mine saw a kid riding his first wave, he observed with a sigh: \"He'll never make President now.\" True, but at least Spencer would have a decent shot at the ASP (Association of Surfing Professionals) world championship or even - who knew? - the Eddie Aikau. I could already see him pulling into yawning 25ft tubes. </p> <p>This pleasant fantasy was cut short by a crisis. \"Y'know Australia in the winter?\" he said as we caught a 1ft wave in together (and I, to my eternal shame, fell off). \"Well, this is colder.\" I had always thought of the verb \"chatter\", as applied to teeth, as an exaggerated metaphor. My boy's teeth were not just chattering. They were having a seminar; they were delivering a sermon denouncing the perils of cold water. I couldn't blame the guy: I have always been a strictly warm-water, softcore kind of surfer myself. I had to take him off to play hide and seek in the dunes and unfreeze. </p> <p>Around the time my son started going blue, I began to realise that I would never be the Richard Williams of surfing. Maybe I should have been yelling, \"Get back on that board or you're never going to make champion 10 years from now!\" (or whatever motivational line the fanatical-father textbook suggests). But something held me back. It may have been the premature deaths of a couple of old surfing buddies and that Great White that went about chewing up a local on our old beach in Australia. </p> <p>There is a pushy, aggressive side to surfing, but there is also a laidback, fatalistic side - let it all happen, what the hell, so be it, don't struggle. As the insipid English sun did its best to beat down on me, I began to understand the vanity of trying to get your kids to be what you are not and live out your dreams vicariously. I wonder now whether I had kids precisely because I would never make the grade as a surfer and I was relying on my offspring to be great surfers for me. They were supposed to rectify my mistakes. Their success would ease my failure. But maybe they didn't really want to be surfers after all. Let them be rock stars, then, or ace movie directors. </p> <p>Now I am convinced that there is only one thing worse than trying to turn your children into what you want to be and getting them to lead your fantasy life on your behalf. And that is making them into what, in reality, you already are (be it dentist or dustman) and having them follow in your footsteps. Maybe both attitudes are just variations on a narcissistic cloning mentality. From now on I want my children to be anything they want to be, except like me - or my alter ego, my more tanned and muscular extrapolated persona. </p> <p>Besides, children have their own fantasies going, notably about what their parents should be. One night Spencer asked me where I was going. I said: \"To a heavyweight world championship boxing match in London.\" He said: \"Good luck, dude.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When it comes to parental dilemmas, life at the Dallas-style ranch occupied by Andy, Fergie and princesses Beatrice and Eugenie is the same as for any other family. Loaded the Yorks may be, but they still have to grapple with the issues that matter. Pocket money, for example. </p> <p>Asked in an interview published this week whether her girls were given pocket money, Fergie replied: \"Yes, and they have to keep a little account of it. I do about \u00a31 a week at the moment. It needs to go up a bit, but it's not just handouts when they need it. They really have a great sense of responsibility, especially Beatrice. She's much more responsible than I am.\" </p> <p>There we have it: the whole conundrum in one brief paragraph. There's the idea that we give children pocket money to teach them how to manage their own little budgets. There's Fergie's guilt that she might be erring on the side of stinginess. There's the notion that they should account for every penny - something with which Fergie has had her own problems in the past. </p> <p>Sadly, however, the Duchess of York has fallen into the trap of believing she is in control of the pocket-money process. She isn't. We are fighting a losing battle, as the hard evidence proves. While adults struggle to get a decent pay rise, the latest survey by the Halifax showed pocket money rising by an inflation-busting 6.8% to an average of \u00a31.88 per week. Pocket money has risen faster than inflation for the past decade. </p> <p>There is good reason for this. While it is possible to take a stand against consumerism, your child will not admire you as a dedicated opponent of multinational capitalism but revile you as a hardhearted beast who is making them the laughing stock of Year Four. </p> <p>Nor does it cut much ice to tell your offspring that it is their patriotic duty to help Gordon Brown prevent the economy from lurching into another boom-bust cycle. Any reasonably savvy child of Beatrice or Eugenie's age (12 and 11 respectively) will know that Brown is the biggest skinflint going and has more in his piggy bank than every child in the country put together. </p> <p>That said, a Blairite emphasis on \"rights and responsibilities\" sometimes pays off. The child gets a set amount - say \u00a31 a week - as a right, but can earn more if they show responsibility by making beds, washing the car, or simply being good. However, it won't work unless you get the incentive structure right. Given the choice of lolling on the sofa watching The Weakest Link or skivvying for considerably less than the minimum wage, kids will invariably plump for indolence. </p> <p>But when it comes down to it, there are certain facts of life you have to accept. The first is that your iron financial resolve will crumble the moment your child gets you inside a bookshop. Parents are suckers for the \"this book would be useful for my project on the Romans\" routine and will never make the little darlings pay for it themselves. Don't worry about this. Think of books as an investment: capital spending for the future. It is entirely different from spending on wasteful consumer goods such as greasy burgers and teeth-rotting fizzy drinks. </p> <p>Furthermore, the normal rules of prudent spending sometimes have to abandoned. For the nation, this is during a war; for a family, it is during a long car journey. In any motorway service station, you will find parents paying over the odds for batteries for personal CD players, crisps and sweets. Experience shows that the way to prevent sibling skirmishes in the back from turning into full-scale bloodbaths is to be fully armed with a small arsenal of over-priced goodies. </p> <p>So how do things work in our house? One daughter saves, the other spends. Eight-year-old Eowyn has grasped the basics of simple interest, insisting that late payment of pocket money should mean extra bunce, while Ursula, 10, has found that skilful use of Keynesian deficit spending - borrowing money - can help in her singlehanded crusade to keep the UK music industry afloat. </p> <p>They are due a rise, but what should it be? An increase of 1.9% in line with underlying inflation seems a bit mean, so let's take the 4.4% increase in earnings, rounded up to 5%. From April 1, it's no longer a pound but a guinea. Each, of course.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When it comes to parental dilemmas, life at the Dallas-style ranch occupied by Andy, Fergie and princesses Beatrice and Eugenie is the same as for any other family. Loaded the Yorks may be, but they still have to grapple with the issues that matter. Pocket money, for example. Asked in an interview published this week whether her girls were given pocket money, Fergie replied: \"Yes, and they have to keep a little account of it. I do about \u00a31 a week at the moment. It needs to go up a bit, but it's not just handouts when they need it. They really have a great sense of responsibility, especially Beatrice. She's much more responsible than I am.\" There we have it: the whole conundrum in one brief paragraph. There's the idea that we give children pocket money to teach them how to manage their own little budgets. There's Fergie's guilt that she might be erring on the side of stinginess. There's the notion that they should account for every penny - something with which Fergie has had her own problems in the past. Sadly, however, the Duchess of York has fallen into the trap of believing she is in control of the pocket-money process. She isn't. We are fighting a losing battle, as the hard evidence proves. While adults struggle to get a decent pay rise, the latest survey by the Halifax showed pocket money rising by an inflation-busting 6.8% to an average of \u00a31.88 per week. Pocket money has risen faster than inflation for the past decade. There is good reason for this. While it is possible to take a stand against consumerism, your child will not admire you as a dedicated opponent of multinational capitalism but revile you as a hardhearted beast who is making them the laughing stock of Year Four. Nor does it cut much ice to tell your offspring that it is their patriotic duty to help Gordon Brown prevent the economy from lurching into another boom-bust cycle. Any reasonably savvy child of Beatrice or Eugenie's age (12 and 11 respectively) will know that Brown is the biggest skinflint going and has more in his piggy bank than every child in the country put together. That said, a Blairite emphasis on \"rights and responsibilities\" sometimes pays off. The child gets a set amount - say \u00a31 a week - as a right, but can earn more if they show responsibility by making beds, washing the car, or simply being good. However, it won't work unless you get the incentive structure right. Given the choice of lolling on the sofa watching The Weakest Link or skivvying for considerably less than the minimum wage, kids will invariably plump for indolence. But when it comes down to it, there are certain facts of life you have to accept. The first is that your iron financial resolve will crumble the moment your child gets you inside a bookshop. Parents are suckers for the \"this book would be useful for my project on the Romans\" routine and will never make the little darlings pay for it themselves. Don't worry about this. Think of books as an investment: capital spending for the future. It is entirely different from spending on wasteful consumer goods such as greasy burgers and teeth-rotting fizzy drinks. Furthermore, the normal rules of prudent spending sometimes have to abandoned. For the nation, this is during a war; for a family, it is during a long car journey. In any motorway service station, you will find parents paying over the odds for batteries for personal CD players, crisps and sweets. Experience shows that the way to prevent sibling skirmishes in the back from turning into full-scale bloodbaths is to be fully armed with a small arsenal of over-priced goodies. So how do things work in our house? One daughter saves, the other spends. Eight-year-old Eowyn has grasped the basics of simple interest, insisting that late payment of pocket money should mean extra bunce, while Ursula, 10, has found that skilful use of Keynesian deficit spending - borrowing money - can help in her singlehanded crusade to keep the UK music industry afloat. They are due a rise, but what should it be? An increase of 1.9% in line with underlying inflation seems a bit mean, so let's take the 4.4% increase in earnings, rounded up to 5%. From April 1, it's no longer a pound but a guinea. Each, of course.",

      "body": "<p>Pianist Mitsuko Uchida has strong opinions about tea. \"I drink only Darjeeling, and I am very particular about where it comes from,\" she says. This is no ordinary stuff: it is harvested from the first flush of tea leaves in a particular field in the Himalayas, you can only buy it in Paris and you have to drink it black. \"And if you don't like it, you accept it anyway,\" she beams. As it is with tea, so it is with music: she has fantastically high standards. </p> <p>Though born in Japan, 52-year-old Uchida grew up and trained in Vienna; and, after an initial reaction against the city's stuffiness and traditionalism, she has made its music, especially Mozart and Schubert, the core of her repertoire. But the Mozart concertos she will be performing next week on London's South Bank - K413, 414 and 415 - won't look, at first, like concertos. She is playing them not with an orchestra, but a string quartet. </p> <p>The chamber version of the concertos is Mozart's own, and every bit as rewarding as the original scoring for small orchestra. But are they still concertos? \"I was thinking the other day what the definition of a piano concerto is,\" says Uchida. \"The difference between Mozart's piano sonatas and piano concertos is that the sonatas are personal pieces: even the biggest and strongest you can still play just for yourself. His piano concertos are, as a genre, the most special, beautiful and strongest of his works, just half a notch behind his operas. But it's also true that these pieces were written to show off what he could do. And that gives it an extra kick.\" </p> <p>For some musicians, Mozart is the most difficult of all composers to perform successfully - the ultimate test of both technical and spiritual accomplishment. Uchida doesn't necessarily see it that way. \"Of course, Mozart is very, very, very difficult. But for me, personally, Beethoven might be more difficult - his difficulties lie somewhere else. Mozart's difficulties arise possibly because it is the least overblown of music. That makes it more difficult to perform because everything is so transparent and visible. It is seemingly simple, but only seemingly. It is horrendously complicated; it is as complicated as human emotions are. </p> <p>\"Mozart knew and saw and could transform all the various combinations of colours of emotion into sound and make them beautiful. That was his strength. Shakespeare used certain very simple words that any idiot can use and suddenly they were transported. Mozart does the same.\" </p> <p>Uchida talks the way she plays. Much of the time her voice is very quiet: you have to sit forward and concentrate hard. Then, suddenly, she will let forth a sky-high flare of emphasis. In both conversation and performance the fierce, dynamic intelligence, lack of compromise, lucid argument and intimate, private yet entirely audible sensitivity to the inner life of music are the same. On the platform, she says, she does not think about projecting to the back row of the gallery. Instead, she wants to draw the audience down to her, to make the hall \"shrink\". </p> <p>This is why she prefers to perform on one of her own concert pianos, housed (with several more) in a studio close to her home. \"To be able to take your own piano to a concert hall is a luxury,\" she enthuses. \"Because on my own pianos I can play so quietly that nobody thought it possible. The set-up is such that I can play quieter and quieter and it still has more to give. That never happens on any other instrument. The younger piano is 11 years old, the older one is a 1962 I have owned since 1982. They are friends of mine. I shall take one of them for the Mozart concertos.\" </p> <p>The intimate atmosphere works. On the way to a concert, an audience member would normally say they're going to hear Kissin, or Pletnev, or whoever. But before an Uchida recital it's simply, \"I'm going to hear Mitsuko.\" This is a pianist whose audience spontaneously calls her by her first name. Next week there's a chance to see why. </p> <p>\u0095 Mitsuko Uchida and the Brentano String Quartet play Mozart at the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (020-7960 4242) on April 3.</p>",

On the platform, she says, she does not think about projecting to the back row of the gallery. Instead, she wants to draw the audience down to her, to make the hall \"shrink\". This is why she prefers to perform on one of her own concert pianos, housed (with several more) in a studio close to her home. \"To be able to take your own piano to a concert hall is a luxury,\" she enthuses. \"Because on my own pianos I can play so quietly that nobody thought it possible. The set-up is such that I can play quieter and quieter and it still has more to give. That never happens on any other instrument. The younger piano is 11 years old, the older one is a 1962 I have owned since 1982. They are friends of mine. I shall take one of them for the Mozart concertos.\" The intimate atmosphere works. On the way to a concert, an audience member would normally say they're going to hear Kissin, or Pletnev, or whoever. But before an Uchida recital it's simply, \"I'm going to hear Mitsuko.\" This is a pianist whose audience spontaneously calls her by her first name. Next week there's a chance to see why. \u0095 Mitsuko Uchida and the Brentano String Quartet play Mozart at the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (020-7960 4242) on April 3.",

      "body": "<p>Now Glenn Hoddle is on his way to White Hart Lane, are the Tottenham really gonna do it again? </p> <p>Well, maybe. But don't expect a return to the glory days of push and run football, nine-goal thrillers and Chas'n' Dave classics any time soon. Hoddle the manager is a lot different than Hoddle the player.</p> <p>Southampton's success this season - they currently lie eighth, heading for their highest-ever finish in the Premiership - is due to their strength at the back. Their recent record of seven successive clean sheets in the league would make even George Graham blush. Meanwhile, Marian Pahars, their most exciting player, is confined to the wing in Hoddle's preferred 4-5-1 formation.</p> <p>The Saints aren't always pretty but they are effective. When Hoddle took over at the Dell just over a year ago, the club were sinking in the relegation mire. Now they are spying a place in Europe. If Hoddle can do the same at Spurs, the hate and the hurt of the Graham era will soon evaporate. </p> <p>And Hoddle's appointment should have one immediate benefit: the retention of Sol Campbell. Everyone knew that Campbell and Graham didn't get on, and because of that Campbell was ready to leave. With Hoddle on board, and Enic dangling a \u00a365,000-a-week salary in front of Campbell's face, expect the Spurs captain to finally commit his future to the club.</p> <p>Yet at every turn, Tottenham's born-again saviour faces problems. There's the thorny issue of money - or rather the lack of it. New chairman Daniel Levy might be a Spurs supporter, but he's no Jack Walker. And Enic's record at Rangers, AEK Athens, Vicenza, Basle and Slavia Prague is hardly reassuring: the company are hungry profit-seekers, not long-term investors. </p> <p>Without a hefty cash injection it's hard to see how Hoddle will address the gaping holes in the Spurs squad - particularly the poverty in the Spurs midfield. At the moment Steffen Freund holds, Tim Sherwood harries, while Oyvind Leonardssen and Darren Anderton are always injured. The young players have potential, but more - much more - is needed to turn Spurs into a top five club again. </p> <p>There's also doubts over Hoddle's man-management skills. During the World Cup 1998 he often appeared aloof and arrogant: he ridiculed David Beckham in training and alienated several players.

      "bodyText": "Now Glenn Hoddle is on his way to White Hart Lane, are the Tottenham really gonna do it again? Well, maybe. But don't expect a return to the glory days of push and run football, nine-goal thrillers and Chas'n' Dave classics any time soon. Hoddle the manager is a lot different than Hoddle the player. Southampton's success this season - they currently lie eighth, heading for their highest-ever finish in the Premiership - is due to their strength at the back. Their recent record of seven successive clean sheets in the league would make even George Graham blush. Meanwhile, Marian Pahars, their most exciting player, is confined to the wing in Hoddle's preferred 4-5-1 formation. The Saints aren't always pretty but they are effective. When Hoddle took over at the Dell just over a year ago, the club were sinking in the relegation mire. Now they are spying a place in Europe. If Hoddle can do the same at Spurs, the hate and the hurt of the Graham era will soon evaporate. And Hoddle's appointment should have one immediate benefit: the retention of Sol Campbell. Everyone knew that Campbell and Graham didn't get on, and because of that Campbell was ready to leave. With Hoddle on board, and Enic dangling a \u00a365,000-a-week salary in front of Campbell's face, expect the Spurs captain to finally commit his future to the club. Yet at every turn, Tottenham's born-again saviour faces problems. There's the thorny issue of money - or rather the lack of it. New chairman Daniel Levy might be a Spurs supporter, but he's no Jack Walker. And Enic's record at Rangers, AEK Athens, Vicenza, Basle and Slavia Prague is hardly reassuring: the company are hungry profit-seekers, not long-term investors. Without a hefty cash injection it's hard to see how Hoddle will address the gaping holes in the Spurs squad - particularly the poverty in the Spurs midfield. At the moment Steffen Freund holds, Tim Sherwood harries, while Oyvind Leonardssen and Darren Anderton are always injured. The young players have potential, but more - much more - is needed to turn Spurs into a top five club again. There's also doubts over Hoddle's man-management skills. During the World Cup 1998 he often appeared aloof and arrogant: he ridiculed David Beckham in training and alienated several players. Although it was Hoddle's ill-advised comments on reincarnation which forced him to resign as England coach, it was the backdrop of uninspiring displays against Sweden and Bulgaria - due in part by losing the players' trust with his World Cup diary - that made the resulting political storm impossible to weather. Hoddle will argue that his mistakes have made him a better manager. And he's probably right. It's also true that he has nearly all of the credentials needed to manage Spurs. The club's supporters will hope that Hoddle will finally be able to turn his undoubted talent into trophies - but the rest of us will need more convincing that Tottenham's brave new world is just around the corner. sean.ingle@theguardian.com",

The channel will continue its emphasis on gardening shows with the return of the Chelsea Flower Show with presenters including Alan Titchmarsh and Charlie Dimmock. The season also includes award-winning hit US show Malcolm in the Middle, in which American family life is seen comically through the eyes of a boy. Boyle's films, Strumpet and Vacuuming Completely Nude In Paradise, have been scripted by Jim Cartwright, who wrote the acclaimed movie and play Little Voice. Strumpet stars Christopher Eccleston in a tale about three unlikely companions trying to make it in the music business. Vacuuming features Timothy Spall as a salesman in line for a top award whose efforts are hampered by his mild-mannered trainee. Other dramas include Perfect Strangers, the new project from writer/director Stephen Poliakoff, whose Shooting the Past series won a string of awards. The Chelsea Flower Show comes back to BBC2 in May after finding a home on Channel 4 and will also be featured heavily on radio and BBC online. One of its hosts, Diarmud Gavin - presenter of Home Front in the Garden - will also front another new series, Planet Patio. Masterchef, formerly presented by Loyd Grossman on BBC1, transfers to BBC2 with Gary Rhodes as its new presenter. Factual series include Ancient Apocalypse in which science and sophisticated computer graphics show how past civilisations were wiped out. Endgame in Ireland gives a definitive history of the peace process. \"BBC2 is currently on a four-year high, proving that our ambition - to produce big ideas and tell big stories, but with a different twist - is working,\" said Jane Root, BBC2 controller. \"This spring and summer we're giving audiences more of what they want and what we're best at - good quality programmes that don't talk down to viewers, but are rewarding, pleasurable and fun.\"",

An industry body has just been awarded government funding to look into the problem of overwork in adland. The department for education and employment is providing funding for an Institute of Practitioners in Advertising research programme on work/life balance. The long hours and high pressure of a job in advertising were highlighted in last year's IPA Women in Advertising study. A lack of family-friendly employment policies in agencies was blamed for the high turnover of female staff. \"The whole issue of work/life balance is something the government is very keen to look at,\" said an IPA spokeswoman. \"We are keen to encourage a more enlightened approach and are looking at drawing up guidelines for the industry to use.\" The government funds will be used to pay for a study carried out by Flametree, the work/life consultancy, into best practice. The data will be made public this summer. The results will be supplied a new working party set up by the IPA to look at how the industry can retain its top talent. The working party will be chaired by Christine Walker, founder of Walker Media and one of the few women to have made it to the top in advertising.

BSkyB is putting an emphasis on its homegrown productions to shake off the perception it only screens US imports. New dramas include Do or Die - featuring Patsy Palmer and the Full Monty star Hugo Speer in the Australian criminal underworld - and the Bombmaker, a production about terrorism, starring Dervla Kirwan and Samantha Bond. Interactivity is also a key element in Sky's new season. \"People want to use their TV in new ways,\" said the Sky spokesman. \"Look at the success of interactive football and interactive cricket.\" Hotter Sex - a series examining the sex lives of the British - will to carry out an interactive survey of viewers' relationships.

Amy Schoening was appointed last month to the newly created position of Gap Inc chief marketing officer. Ms Schoening was previously executive vice-president of marketing for the Banana Republic stores. Her appointment left Gap Inc's brands - Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic - without individual heads of marketing. But Old Navy has subsequently hired Tom Clendenin, previously an executive at cable sports network ESPN, to head marketing for its brand. Earlier this month, Gap named Nancy Green vice-president of women's merchandising for the Gap brand. Related story Feb 7: Gap hires first three-brand marketing chief",

      "bodyText": "\"Double jeopardy\" TV regulation, which has led to disgruntled viewers getting different rulings on a show from different watchdogs, is to end. The Broadcasting Standards Commission, Independent Television Commission and Radio Authority said today they have torn down the fences between themselves and started to confer on complaints. Their efforts are the first sign of regulatory \"detente\" ahead of the creation of a super-watchdog, Ofcom. In the past the ITC and the BSC have issued conflicting rulings on a variety of shows including a Channel 4 cookery programme which featured placenta burgers. Viewers still have the option of complaining to separate bodies but they will effectively make joint adjudications. Talking to each other about complaints is just one of a number of co-operative measures included in a memorandum of understanding signed by all five broadcasting and communications watchdogs in preparation for the creation of Ofcom. \"The five bodies have pledged to establish mechanisms to ensure that complaints are handled so as to avoid double jeopardy wherever possible,\" the memorandum said. A BSC spokesman confirmed the regulator had already started talking to the ITC and RA about responding to complaints. \"One organisation may handle a complaint, or we may agree to work along the same lines,\" he added. \"Mrs Brown can write to us, the ITC or the RA if she wants and we can all deal with the complaint. The idea is just to talk to each other more.\" Last year's communications white paper set out plans for the three broadcasting regulators, Oftel and the Radiocommunications Agency to be merged into a single body. But the new regulator will not be set up until a Communications Act is passed after the general election. In the meantime, the five regulators have agreed to collaborate to \"avoid unjustified duplication of expenditure\". Related story Dec 12: What the new super-regulator will do",

      "bodyText": "The war of words between the record industry and Napster intensified today when the Recording Industry Association of America hit out at the song-swapping service. It branded Napster's attempts to block copyrighted songs an \"utter failure\" and upped the pressure on courts to shut down the internet service by filing a new court order for Napster to change the filter software it is using to charge users to download tracks. The RIAA is furious because it says users are still able to download tracks for nothing. \"Napster seems to have adopted the most porous filter available. It's not working, it never will work and Napster should be ordered to implement an effective filter or to change its filtering method,\" said Hilary Rosen, president of the RIAA. The association also maintains that many of the songs Napster claims to have filtered are still available on the site. A bewildered Napster hit back by saying it was doing the best it could and had so far managed to block 275,000 songs. It defended itself by saying that the record companies had not co-operated sufficiently to allow it to comply with the original court order from three weeks ago. Napster has also had problems identifying song titles that users had deliberately misspelt to avoid filters. Napster's chief executive Hank Barry stressed that \"Napster is aggressively complying with the injunction with significant measurable results\". However, pressure is growing on Napster, which is due back in court on April 10. In its court filing, RIAA said it had searched for the 212 copyrighted works it originally asked Napster to block in its lawsuit and found every song still available on the site. Napster, however, is determined not to allow legal red tape to get the better of it. It is encouraging hard-core fans to rally round and descend on Washington next Tuesday when senators meet to discuss the legal battle. But with usage down by a quarter since it brought in controls, Napster seems to be gradually losing its once unequivocal support. Related story: Mar 14: Napster in last-ditch rescue bid",

      "body": "<p>For a time in the 1980s, urban local government was a fashionable place to work. Labour councils had become the frontline of resistance to a Conservative dominated parliament, and many young leftwingers wanted a piece of the action. It was then that a 22-year-old business studies graduate, Francesca Okosi, decided she needed a break from the world of marketing and took a temporary personnel job with the east London borough of Newham. </p> <p>Thirteen years on, Okosi is still in local government human resources, but has risen to the heights of her profession. She currently heads the personnel department of Brent, north London; has a reputation for speaking out on equalities issues; and has been described by Personnel Today magazine as \"one of the most able exponents of human resources in the public sector\". </p> <p>Okosi's talents have also been recognised by her peers, who recently made her vice-president of the local government Society of Chief Personnel Officers (Socpo), whose annual conference opens today in Brighton. Next year, she will become the first black woman to hold the society's top job. </p> <p>This is all a long way from her original goal of becoming a big success in marketing. \"I entered local government at a time when I had very strong views about public services and communities,\" she says. \"It's become like a drug since then, really.\" </p> <p>The politics are still there - Okosi jokingly describes herself as a \"loony lefty\" - but these days her views are expressed largely through her interest in the way that human resources can help regenerate poverty-stricken communities. In Brent, she says, local communities are suffering from unemployment, while the council and local NHS organisations are facing skills shortages. The council is trying to bridge the gap by training the jobless for public service, killing two birds with one stone. \"Even if we can't provide people with employment,\" she asks, \"shouldn't we be giving them work experience and other opportunities and working with our partners to do that?\" </p> <p>With local government currently undergoing the widest ranging reforms it has faced, Okosi also sees a key role for personnel chiefs in helping their councils deal with change. Labour's \"best value\" regime requires improvements in local government services and cares little whether a council, voluntary organisation or private sector company actually does the work. </p> <p>Human resources professionals have to provide the staff and training to support this process, but they also have to undergo it themselves. That means difficult changes in the way they work. Money is already tight because the government wants funds concentrated on frontline services, and personnel departments are an easy target for cuts. The outsourcing of local government services also means there are fewer council employees to be managed - and so less need for human resources. Okosi admits that this could mean cuts in the number of personnel officers, but she insists that those who are left will still have an important job to do. \"The role of human resources may change,\" she says. \"It needs to focus on how it helps individual organisations in the private, public or voluntary sectors to fulfil their responsibilities to the local community.\" </p> <p>Helping Socpo's membership deal with this shake-up is one of Okosi's main aims for her term as vice-president. The task may sound daunting, but Okosi gives the impression that her eye for a challenge is what keeps her faithful to the public sector. Her CV includes a spell helping tackle a major social services strike in Newham, east London, from where she moved to nearby - and by then already troubled - Hackney, taking a post as a senior social services personnel officer in 1990. \"I like challenges, I think that's what made me go to Hackney,\" she says. \"I like to go to places people tell me not to.\" </p> <p>Between 1997 and 1999, she also spent an unhappy period as head of human resources at Merton, south London. She believes now that the authority had really wanted a straightforward administrator, a role she was clearly not suited to. As she says: \"I want to be in an organisation that's buzzing.\" </p> <p>That may be why she has chosen to become Socpo's vice-president at a time when the society is in a state of flux. Socpo recently decided to expand its membership from its traditional base of chief personnel officers to encompass all local government human resources specialists, including those who have transferred to the private sector and now provide services to councils. </p> <p>Under current president Terry Gorman, Socpo has been making steady progress on improving its visibility and clout within local government. At the society's conference, sponsored by the Guardian, he will today officially pass the baton to new president Keith Handley, of Bradford council, who will work in tandem with Okosi. </p> <p>Combine all this with her job in Brent, and you might think Okosi has more than enough on her plate to satisfy her addiction to challenge and change. Yet she already has one eye on the future. \"I'm slowing down as I get older,\" she concedes. \"In Brent, I do want to see what I'm doing coming out the other end. But I'm coming to a point where I have to ask myself: what next?\"</p>",

As she says: \"I want to be in an organisation that's buzzing.\" That may be why she has chosen to become Socpo's vice-president at a time when the society is in a state of flux. Socpo recently decided to expand its membership from its traditional base of chief personnel officers to encompass all local government human resources specialists, including those who have transferred to the private sector and now provide services to councils. Under current president Terry Gorman, Socpo has been making steady progress on improving its visibility and clout within local government. At the society's conference, sponsored by the Guardian, he will today officially pass the baton to new president Keith Handley, of Bradford council, who will work in tandem with Okosi. Combine all this with her job in Brent, and you might think Okosi has more than enough on her plate to satisfy her addiction to challenge and change. Yet she already has one eye on the future. \"I'm slowing down as I get older,\" she concedes. \"In Brent, I do want to see what I'm doing coming out the other end. But I'm coming to a point where I have to ask myself: what next?\"",

Addressing a conference of the Christian Socialist Movement, with other faiths in attendance, he will praise the good churches can do in community renewal and the value of church schools. Competing with William Hague, he will claim Labour values are closest to Christian values. True, according to Mori. The Church of England is no longer the Tory party at prayer: only 26% of its members vote Tory, 48% Labour. Among Roman Catholics only 17% are Tory, with 48% Labour. In this country the far right evangelicals are still a minority.</p> <p>But mixing God and politics is a perilous business. If the PM's text is not well-worded he may risk the WI slow hand-clap.

But outside the hall, the great agnostic/atheist British majority has a queasy distaste for politicians airing religious sentiments: it only fuels their cynicism.</p> <p>At a breakfast this week, the Bishop of Liverpool and the Reverend Steve Chalke explained their pitch to the prime minister for tomorrow's conference. Churches do community best, with the best volunteers and the best schools, the \"faith dollar\" goes further and they want more social funding. Chalke wants the prime minister to stop \"hard left Labour councils\" refusing to fund faith groups on the grounds that church groups only employ their own church members and Christian school teachers. Faith groups only work, he says, because they are all believers. He is not polite about \"state\" employees, as if they were clock-watching time-servers.</p> <p>Churches attract politicians. Their edifices suggest an important place in communities, for lack of anything else tangible to grasp, despite often empty pews and aged congregations. But founding a national social policy around a church attendance currently at 7.5% (generous estimate) looks implausible. It is another colossal difference with the US which ought to make British politicians more wary of using US social thinkers. Robert Putnam is left of centre and knows Britain (unlike Hague's guru, Marvin Olasky, a bible-belt, anti-welfare anti-abortionist). But even so, Putnam's prescriptions sound essentially alien. His vision of community, for all his denials, looks like a return to the 1950s, women back to Kinder, K\u00fcche, Kirche. His social determinism is out of step with modern times: it looks cynical to want poor people to join churches not because religion is true but because it is good for them.</p> <p>The reason Labour's social policies may work where the old slum clearances failed over the years is because they focus on the people. Funding renewal through partnerships that join up all the local state agencies with voluntary groups is a way of reaching out through every tentacle to all that moves and breathes. Some churches do run brilliant social programmes for drug addicts, the homeless, the young and the old. But religious groups must take their place along with the other voluntary groups - funded and judged according to their results.</p> <p>There is a lot of hocus-pocus talked about community, as if it were magic to be sprinkled about like holy water. Nostalgic for old community values, Putnam recalls the glory days of Elks, Salvation Army, choral societies, scouts and churches. But times change. Creating a new sense of community requires building on people's lives as they are now, the things people want enough to need to band together communally. Community activity always depended on women, but they have now gone out to work instead.</p> <p>But seek out where strangers do still meet and it is still largely parents - mainly mothers - outside school gates, playgroup or playground, at the checkout or the baby clinic. Ask communities now what they need most locally and the first answer is childcare - a guaranteed creche and nursery place for every child. Harriet Harman's recent childcare commission toured the country and that was the universal answer.</p> <p>So if Labour wants to foster a new community spirit, start with beautiful children's palaces, attractive welcoming places, offering every service from ante-natal to after-school clubs. At a stroke it would bring together all parts of the community under one roof, in centres run by and for local parents, the only way to unite all classes, each contributing according to income. These would be the missing social heart-beat in each area, nurturing a multitude of voluntary and self-help groups, clubs, classes and community action, run by faith or non-faith volunteers side by side with professionals.</p> <p>Now that would be community, but it doesn't come cheap. One estimate suggests \u00a310bn for 10,000 centres. Money well spent, it would transform individual lives, binding together isolated families and socially divided communities everywhere. Kick-starting community requires less government angst and more government action.

Now that would be community, but it doesn't come cheap. One estimate suggests \u00a310bn for 10,000 centres. Money well spent, it would transform individual lives, binding together isolated families and socially divided communities everywhere. Kick-starting community requires less government angst and more government action. What a manifesto pledge that would be. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p><strong>Q:</strong> You have just returned from a five-week \"advanced management programme\" at Wharton business school in the US. What useful tips did you pick up? <br><strong>A:</strong> The big thing I learned is that you go there and you think the BBC and Britain are unique. Then you spend five weeks with people who run companies and bits of companies all round the world and you see they all face the same problems. How to make the money go round, how to hold on to talent, how to have a good short-term tactical plan and, at the same time, a long-term strategy. I was amazed by that and I think Michael [Jackson] felt the same when he went. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What impact has the move of the BBC1 news from 9pm to 10pm had on BBC2?<br> <strong>A:</strong> I was involved in the discussions in that really scary and exciting week when the decision was made. I must admit I didn't think it would necessarily be positive for BBC2 - I though we might lose out in an all-out war between BBC1 and ITV. But we're 0.8% up so far this year, compared with the same period last year. I think it's brought a new clarity to both BBC1 and BBC2. It means you can do really big things at 9pm on both channels. Look at Monday night - you had comedy on BBC2 and NCS: Manhunt on BBC1. Both big but complementary programmes.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What's going on with BBC2's zones? Comedy has moved from Friday to Monday and history from Saturday to Friday. <br><strong>A:</strong> With comedy on Friday night I was feeling like one of those world war one generals, sending new sitcoms over the top and saying to the producer \"Don't worry, it's only up against Frasier.\" To keep doing the more experimental stuff I had to find another place for it. And it's proved to be really the right thing to do. <br> History is a good thing to play against Friends and Frasier on Friday and on Monday we've found a night when there's no other comedy. We've launched stuff like Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps, which got over 3m on Monday night.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>When Greg Dyke unveiled his TV channel strategy last year, some observers thought BBC2 might lose its youth-orientated programming, such as comedy, to the new digital channel BBC3 and more highbrow factual stuff to its sibling BBC4. How do you respond to this? <br><strong>A:</strong> BBC3 and BBC4 are digital start-up channels and they won't be playing the same game as we are at the moment. Maybe they will in two or three years but that's a long time in TV.<br> For the next couple of years, BBC2 will continue to do what it is doing at the moment, which is to be a pleasurable, enjoyable, mainstream channel. <br> We do things like history and science in an accessible and sophisticated way. We do \"modern classics\", which is doing modern versions of classic genres, such as drama, arts, history, comedy - I talk to producers a lot about that idea and how to refine it.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why did you want to bring the Chelsea Flower Show back to BBC2 from Channel 4? <br><strong>A:</strong> I made a big personal bid to get that one back. I felt we were the channel that did gardening and it felt weird that the prime event of the gardening year was not there. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What will viewers notice that's different about the Chelsea Flower Show coverage from previous years? <br> <strong>A:</strong> Diarmuid Gavin, one of our key new faces, will be there along with Alan Titchmarsh and the rest. I kind of missed seeing Alan there.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Loyd Grossman described the changes to the Masterchef format - such as reducing the competitive element and introducing more practical cookery tips - as \"moronic\" when the show moved from BBC1 to BBC2 and he quit. How do you respond to that? <br> <strong>A:</strong> Loyd did a fabulous job over the years but it was time to move on. I wanted something people cooking at home could get into more, to modernise the food. I felt if it was going to come over to BBC2 I wanted it to be a part of the BBC2 family of cooking shows. Having Gary Rhodes in there as the new presenter is part of that.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What other shows will move from BBC1 to BBC2 as part of the repositioning of the channels? <br> <strong>A:</strong> There is nothing else planned at the moment. We've done most of the big moves between the channels - Have I got News for You?, Omnibus, Masterchef. And with Masterchef, we were looking for a new-format cookery show anyway.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Last year you spoke about giving countryside issues a new hearing with the series presented by Clarissa Dickson-Wright. Now the countryside is in crisis, what new approaches are you planning to offer viewers? <br> <strong>A:</strong> Clarissa's doing another series. The countryside is already a big issue with us at BBC2; it's been a big issue since I've been here. That's why I did Clarissa and the Countryman - I wanted to tackly countryside issues seriously. <br> <br> <strong>Q; </strong>What are the challenges ahead for BBC2? <br> <strong>A:</strong> The modern classics thing is working brilliantly with things like A History of Britain and I Love the 1980s. We are lining up a whole range of things that will take that forward - some very big history and science programmes. <br> We have become a well-educated country, with sophisticated tastes in terms of things like DIY and shopping. BBC2 is very much in tune with that social change.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Have you personal favourites in this spring/summer schedule or projects you fought particularly hard to bring to the screen? <br> <strong>A:</strong> Perfect Strangers [the new Stephen Poliakoff drama] was one of the first shows I commissioned after taking over as controller. It's one of those things that really sums up what's best about BBC2. It's got a fantastically strong storyline, it's very passionate and it's about the past and the present.<br> <br> With Danny Boyle, it's amazing to get someone who has worked on the Beach, which cost $140m or something, to come and work for BBC2 for a fraction of that [on Strumpet and Vacuuming Completely Nude in Paradise, with Jim Cartwright].<br> Danny said after making this incredibly expensive Hollywood movie he wanted to make something much more intimate. We're getting them on air quickly, shot on video.<br> <br> Art that Shook the World is very much in line with my thinking about BBC2. It takes big subjects, in this case four pieces of art that really changed things, that mean a lot to a lot of people and does something different with them.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the \u00a383m BBC2 programming spend for this season compare with the same period last year? <br> <strong>A:</strong> It feels like more than last year. When I took over the channel I looked hard at where we spend the money. I've tried to concentrate more on big, expensive shows - like Ancient Apocalypse and Perfect Strangers - that really put the money up there on screen.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Have you started to see the benefit of the extra programming money Greg Dyke has promised? <br> <strong>A:</strong> We're already spending it right now - it's rather enjoyable. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What are you spending it on? <br> <strong>A:</strong> Right across the board on more entertainment, drama and factual. In some cases, we're doing bigger things that we couldn't otherwise have done.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>What's going on with Jamie Oliver? There have been reports of him being wooed by other broadcasters. <br> <strong>A:</strong> I think we'll have a big long-term relationship with Jamie - I think he's sticking with us. We've just signed a deal for the next series and we're talking about what he does next. <br> To be honest, I was more worried about him just wanting to become a full-time chef rather than going to another broadcaster.</p>",

This is the new thing.</p> <p>I found Carol Duncan in a Portakabin she uses as an office. She was surrounded by Sainsbury's invoices and office stationery. Like her husband Peter, she considers herself a modern rural producer. \"I was delighted when we managed to get rid of the very last cow off this farm,\" she said. \"That's the thing about cows, you know, they just poo all the time.\"</p> <p>Peter's father and grandfather had run the farm in the traditional West Country way; they had livestock and worked the fields through thick and thin. \"But from an early age I wasn't interested in that kind of farming,\" Peter said. \"I wanted to be inside reading books. And I was interested in the different things you can do with milk. In the 1960s we farmers needed to diversify. The traditional way had been to stand around waiting for the government price review. I wanted to change things. My father would say: 'Who's going to milk the cows?'</p> <p>\"We started with three churns. Carol was an art teacher and that kept us going through the difficult years.

We had to increase the price of the yoghurt by 5% and we lost some of our German contracts. I went out and fought to get them back. It was horrible: 200-year-old cheesemakers were shut down and hardly a Devon clotted cream-maker was left standing. We thought we were going out of business.\"</p> <p>\"We started exporting our stuff,\" Peter said, \"to Belgium especially. We supply an upmarket supermarket chain called Delhaize.\"</p> <p>\"Until this morning,\" Carol interjected. \"We've just been banned from exporting.\"</p> <p>\"We're hoping it will only be a matter of weeks,\" Peter said, \"but this sort of thing can ruin people. We're praying it doesn't spread.\"</p> <p>The Duncans have more than 30 people working at Stapleton - chopping, grating, mixing, packaging, labelling, loading. The old farm buildings where the yoghurt and ice-cream are produced look typical enough among the high hedges of north Devon, yet inside each shed are silver machines and refrigerated rooms that are miles away from the world of cows.</p> <p>Peter tells the story of the Sainsbury's development manager coming down to see them in 1998 as if relating a great oral ballad about a local battle or love affair. \"The woman came down. I thought she seemed so fierce. They had already taken samples of our yoghurt away. They said they liked them. But when the woman came that day she just said: 'I suppose you'd like to see these' and it was the artwork for the pots. They'd already decided we were going into business. I nearly fell off my chair.\"</p> <p>Carol laughed. \"Yeah, and they said, how many of these could we produce a week?\" They started aiming for 10,000 pots a week in a hundred stores. \"It was incredibly hard work,\" Peter said. \"We were putting yoghurt into pots by hand and pressing the lids on. Then they wanted more. We had to get better machinery. So it was off to the bank for \u00a380,000. Come February 1999, we were doing 50,000-60,000 pots a week.\"</p> <p>\"We think Sainsbury's are geniuses,\" Carol added. \"We give them yoghurt and they sell it.\"</p> <p>Stapleton Farm processes all its own fruit by hand; the milk comes from three local farms. Recently, they started giving the milk farmers half a penny more per litre, because of the hard time the farmers are having. \"It's been a music hall joke for years,\" Peter said, \"about farmers complaining. But now the worst has come true.\"</p> <p>\"The ladies who work for us are all here to earn money to feed their kids,\" Carol said. \"The farms they live on are struggling. It's a struggle for us, too, but it's our little dream.\"</p> <p>The Duncans' dream has been one of survival and self-sufficiency, and being free of that last cow. But as environmentalists, they may have trouble living with the price of their own success: expansion. Supermarkets want to be able to rely on volume and if Stapleton Farm's yoghurt continues to grow in popularity, it will have to get bigger; the charm of its smallness cannot last. The week I met the Duncans, they were reeling from having bought a \u00a368,000 machine that wasn't yet working. Doing well entails spending more, so demand can be met. They are heavily in debt but also rejoicing in their success.</p> <p>\"Starting to do business with Sainsbury's feels like being mown down by a bus,\" Peter said.</p> <p>\"Yes,\" Carol said, \"but I was so relieved when we got rid of that last cow and that old farm.

      "body": "<p>Ministers failed to act on warnings from government advisers in 1997 that pigswill - or catering waste and by-products - should be banned because they believed foot and mouth could never again appear in Britain, government sources said last night.</p> <p>The spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee warned that discarded meat should not be fed to animals within a species to avoid the outbreak of another potentially disastrous epidemic following the banning of meat and bone meal in 1996.</p> <p>Although pigs cannot, in theory, catch BSE, the committee was concerned that other diseases, or variants of them, could be triggered off by a piece of suspect meat hidden in pigswill, which is fed to fewer than 2% of the 11m pigs slaughtered in Britain annually.</p> <p>In 1997, few specialists thought foot and mouth could return to Britain after 30 years. But there was concern that infected meat could transmit either swine fever or other diseases.</p> <p>Harriet Kimbell, a law professor and member of Seac, said yesterday that the committee had successfully called for a ban on abattoir waste being fed to pigs in 1997. Sub sequently, they discussed the wider use of pigswill, often unspecified meat collected as waste from restaurants, school canteens, and food companies and boiled as a cocktail to produce a thick, lightish liquid.</p> <p>\"Although the issue was debated, the recommendation was not quite so clear-cut to stop it although some members thought they had recommended that pigswill would stop,\" she recalled. \"Since 1997, Seac has said in general terms that material should not be recycled within a species because - say - contaminated pork would pass to pigs.\"</p> <p>Swill was once part of everyday life. Every school canteen had a \"pig bin\", where leftovers would be dumped before being recycled into swill. Pigs ate it because their robust digestive systems can take meat and all kinds of plants. Farmers liked it because it was cheap.</p> <p>In 1980 the use of waste food from airlines was banned, and the number of licensed operators fell to 1,300 by 1987, when a new order also required for swill internally generated on the farm to be cooked. By 1990 this had fallen to just over 300.</p> <p>For the past two years all businesses that process, transport or feed swill have been required to be licensed and their premises inspected regularly by vets.</p> <p>The tougher regulations have deterred most farmers and they instead use manufactured farm feed consisting of cereals fortified with soya protein. Pigswill is now fed to only around 120,000 pigs annually, and used on a small proportion of the 3,000-odd pig farms, concentrated mainly in East Anglia and East and North Yorkshire. The small fattening unit of Bobby and Ronald Waugh, at Heddon-on-the-Wall - the likely source of the outbreak - is therefore an exception in an industry which prides itself on far higher standards than rivals abroad.</p> <p>Maff regulations stipulate that swill must be catering waste - from kitchens, restaurants and food factories - and \"non mammalian animal by-products\", such as poultry and fish waste.</p> <p>It can only be fed to pigs after it has been \"fully processed\" - to at least 100C for one hour - at premises approved and licensed by the ministry.</p> <p>Movement from the \"holding premises\" to another pig unit, which is not licensed, also should be approved, according to regulations updated two years' ago.</p> <p>The processing of catering waste imported on planes, ships or trains, is also illegal.</p> <p>Some farmers' leaders now believe the government's ban on swill is being used as a diversion to avoid facing other tough questions about imported pig meat.</p> <p>Richard Longthorp, an East Yorkshire pig farmer and a board member of the Pig Producers' Association, said last night: \"Ministers are engaged in a cynical attempt to find a scapegoat for their own incompetence, jumping up and down about pigswill.

      "bodyText": "Ministers failed to act on warnings from government advisers in 1997 that pigswill - or catering waste and by-products - should be banned because they believed foot and mouth could never again appear in Britain, government sources said last night. The spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee warned that discarded meat should not be fed to animals within a species to avoid the outbreak of another potentially disastrous epidemic following the banning of meat and bone meal in 1996. Although pigs cannot, in theory, catch BSE, the committee was concerned that other diseases, or variants of them, could be triggered off by a piece of suspect meat hidden in pigswill, which is fed to fewer than 2% of the 11m pigs slaughtered in Britain annually. In 1997, few specialists thought foot and mouth could return to Britain after 30 years. But there was concern that infected meat could transmit either swine fever or other diseases. Harriet Kimbell, a law professor and member of Seac, said yesterday that the committee had successfully called for a ban on abattoir waste being fed to pigs in 1997. Sub sequently, they discussed the wider use of pigswill, often unspecified meat collected as waste from restaurants, school canteens, and food companies and boiled as a cocktail to produce a thick, lightish liquid. \"Although the issue was debated, the recommendation was not quite so clear-cut to stop it although some members thought they had recommended that pigswill would stop,\" she recalled. \"Since 1997, Seac has said in general terms that material should not be recycled within a species because - say - contaminated pork would pass to pigs.\" Swill was once part of everyday life. Every school canteen had a \"pig bin\", where leftovers would be dumped before being recycled into swill. Pigs ate it because their robust digestive systems can take meat and all kinds of plants. Farmers liked it because it was cheap. In 1980 the use of waste food from airlines was banned, and the number of licensed operators fell to 1,300 by 1987, when a new order also required for swill internally generated on the farm to be cooked. By 1990 this had fallen to just over 300. For the past two years all businesses that process, transport or feed swill have been required to be licensed and their premises inspected regularly by vets. The tougher regulations have deterred most farmers and they instead use manufactured farm feed consisting of cereals fortified with soya protein. Pigswill is now fed to only around 120,000 pigs annually, and used on a small proportion of the 3,000-odd pig farms, concentrated mainly in East Anglia and East and North Yorkshire. The small fattening unit of Bobby and Ronald Waugh, at Heddon-on-the-Wall - the likely source of the outbreak - is therefore an exception in an industry which prides itself on far higher standards than rivals abroad. Maff regulations stipulate that swill must be catering waste - from kitchens, restaurants and food factories - and \"non mammalian animal by-products\", such as poultry and fish waste. It can only be fed to pigs after it has been \"fully processed\" - to at least 100C for one hour - at premises approved and licensed by the ministry. Movement from the \"holding premises\" to another pig unit, which is not licensed, also should be approved, according to regulations updated two years' ago. The processing of catering waste imported on planes, ships or trains, is also illegal. Some farmers' leaders now believe the government's ban on swill is being used as a diversion to avoid facing other tough questions about imported pig meat. Richard Longthorp, an East Yorkshire pig farmer and a board member of the Pig Producers' Association, said last night: \"Ministers are engaged in a cynical attempt to find a scapegoat for their own incompetence, jumping up and down about pigswill. But what are they doing about imports, legal or otherwise? That is the key issue. How the hell did this get into Britain in the first place?\" What's going on?

The deal will make SES the first commercial satellite operator to build a genuine global footprint, allowing it to beam TV, radio and internet services around the world. \"The relationship with GE is an ideal complement to our existing network of strong regional partners,\" said Romain Bausch, chairman of SES. \"The combination of global coverage and our unique regional presence gives us a distinct competitive edge to the advantage of our customers.\" The group will change its name to SES Global as part of the deal and will also list on the New York stock exchange. It is believed one of the obstacles to SES acquiring a major US player was the government of Luxembourg, which owns 30% of the company and did not want to dilute its holding. The Luxembourg-based group decided to go for General Electric's GE Americom after running the rule over several targets, including General Motors' PanAmSat. SES, which is Europe's leading direct-to-home satellite TV broadcaster, will use the GE acquisition as a springboard for its broadband internet strategy. GE Americom also supplies telecoms and internet services for big-name clients such as AOL Time Warner and Disney, and will boost broadband revenues at SES, which stand at just \u00a326m. Some industry observers fear consumers will baulk at the higher price of satellite broadband services. However, the possibility of bundling television, radio and internet onto one distribution platform will appeal to media companies. \"The new SES Global organisation will be well positioned to build the future of broadband satellite communications through a global satellite fleet,\" said Mr Bausch. General Electric will receive \u00a31.9bn in cash and a 22% share in SES Global as part of the deal. Today's deal will need clearance from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, and European competition watchdogs are still poring over GE's recent acquisition of US competitor Honeywell. SES offers radio, television and high-speed internet services in North Africa, Asia and Latin America and to 87m homes in Europe. Following the GE Americom deal, it now owns 28 satellites and part-owns 13 more. This month, the company sealed a \u00a3100m, ten-year deal with ITV to broadcast the network's programmes on a digital satellite platform.

When a passenger books a ticket with us they are advised the terms and conditions applicable to the ticket purchased.\" The air transport users' council points out that airlines are under no obligation to cancel non-transferable tickets because of the crisis. \"We are very pleased that two airlines have chosen to do so,\" says a spokesman. \"It's unfortunate that Ryanair declines to follow suit.\" BA's identity crisis While on the subject of airlines, Bill Kirton's multiplying identity on BA's records was described here earlier this month. BA had confused his Executive Club account with that of another Bill Kirton, declined to respond to his protests, then later renamed him William Davis. BA ignored our pleas for an explanation, but it seems heads rolled after we ran the piece. Kirton has now had his account restored and received an apology. But what's this? David Miller of London, who is also a BA Executive Club member, informs us that for the past four years his account has been confused with a G Miller of the same neighbourhood. \"In 1997 he cleared my account of airmiles for a trip to Nice and although I received a refund the problem is recurring,\" he says. \"I've basically given up trying to get any action out of BA.\" \u0095 This time we only have to wait two weeks for a reply from BA. \"We've set Mr Miller up with a new account and credited him with the lost airmiles,\" says a spokeswoman. \"We're now investigating to see how these cases could have arisen.\" \u0095 Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, phone us on 020-7713 4731, send a fax on 020-7239 9933 or email us at consumer@theguardian.com.",

It has nothing to do with writing,\" Moggach, 52, complained. Even some of those writers lucky enough to be both young and gorgeous are joining the backlash against the tyranny of literary totty. The New Puritans, led by the novelist Nick Blincoe, say they are sick of being marketed as cool and fashionable when they want to be seen as authentic voices of their generation.</p> <p>The gathering yesterday heard how publishers were now judging writers on how many features they might generate in newspaper lifestyle sections, rather than promoting the older \"gargoyles\" who count themselves lucky if they make it onto the review pages.</p> <p>Even Zadie Smith, 25, the award-winning author of White Teeth, was made over - temporarily ditching her specs and Afro look - according to Neil Taylor, publishing director of Orion.</p> <p>\"Looking at how Zadie changed over those months, you can see how writers can allow themselves to be sold as beautiful. I didn't see too many White Teeth reviews without a photograph,\" he said. \"Looks do make a difference, we all know that.

If Louis wasn't short, fat and bald he would have been in the papers all the time.\"</p> <p>Clare Alexander, the editor-turned-agent of Booker winner Pat Barker among others, confessed that when Alex Garland, whose debut The Beach was an instant bestseller, and Donna Tartt, the equally good-looking author of The Secret History, walked into her office she was \"delighted - [they were] both young and beautiful. I would be lying if I said it didn't make my job a lot easier. The best marketing of all though is the work itself, and it has to be good. You can't get away with looks alone, it all comes down to the writing in the end.\"</p> <p>She warned, however, of the consequences of publishers falling into the trap of buying on \"beauty contests\". She said: \"Writing is a craft. It often takes six or seven books for a writer really to come into their own. Pat Barker did not really begin to sell until well into her Regeneration trilogy. I can't see too many publishers today losing money like they did with Pat's early books. Look at the bestsellerlists, and you will find most of the writers there are in their late 40s or 50s.\"</p> <p>Ms Alexander said the obsession with youth was a British phenomenon, and blamed our \"tabloid-driven press\" where the books pages \"are not what they used to be. Because there are fewer reviews than there used to be there has been a drive to get authors into the features pages and the glossy magazines. Obviously if they are young and gorgeous they have got a head start.\"</p> <p>Hype has its limits, though, argued Mr Taylor, who cited the disastrous reviews garnered by Amy Jenkins' heavily marketed debut Honey Moon, whose publication was preceded by acres of adoring press coverage. He accused the creator of the TV hit This Life of \"single-handedly killing off chick-lit [twentysomething female-oriented fiction].</p> <p>\"At least we can thank her for that. What really annoys me is the resources which go into promoting books of no real worth or merit by these so-called celebrity authors. The lesson of the Amy Jenkins debacle is the public is smarter than we give them credit for.\"</p> <p>Mr Taylor, who edited The Long Firm by the equally photogenic Jake Arnott, said proper, talented writers who just happened to be good-looking were now being tarred with the bimbo brush. \"The BBC made a documentary about Jake and the book and it was clear they assumed we were selling it on his looks and not his writing, which is wonderful. He was portrayed as young and beautiful when he is actually nearly 40.\"</p> <p>Blincoe said the New Puritans came about as a reaction to the industry's obsession with youth and trendiness. \"Inevitably, it is easier to get the press and the style magazines interested in a young first-time writer with all the trendy trappings, but that is not why people read books. They want stories from an authentic experience and they are not getting that right now. I've been a publisher myself, and it is amazing how when someone was describing a writer to me, they'd say he or she was 'a great stylist and really gorgeous too' as if that was important.</p> <p>\"That isn't to say that we New Puritans aren't young and beautiful and trendy ourselves, because we are of course.\"</p> <p>Martin Latham, of Waterstone's booksellers, said readers were not particularly interested in the \"fanciability factor\" in a writer. \"I know it sounds strange, but they are actually interested in the book, in stories.

Does it reside in the Rotarians, mothers unions, Women's Institutes, five-a-side leagues, mosques or churches? How elusive these social pressure points are, some eccentric, others empty vessels, unrepresentative of anything but themselves. In this pluralist, diverse society there are few easy entry points into the beating heart of any locality. What is urban freedom for many, a blessed escape from old lace-curtain community, is also desolate isolation for others. </p> <p>Yesterday the American guru of community led a breakfast seminar in 10 Downing Street. Harvard Professor Dr Robert Putnam, author of Bowling Alone gave his causes of the collapse of community: television, two-career families, urban sprawl with commuting and the failure of the second world war generation to pass on war-time civic values to their baby-boomer children. Community is in decline - unions, churches, clubs, bowls, political parties, voting, even visiting bars. Where there is community, there is less crime, better school performance, more happiness. Belonging to one community group delivers the same volume of happiness as doubling your income. </p> <p>Belonging to one group is so good for you that it reduces by a half the chance of dying in the next year, two groups reduces death risk by three quarters. (Putnam's numerical sociology sometimes verges on numerology.) </p> <p>One answer, he says, is faith-based communities which \"enhance civic life\" and he welcomes President Bush's intention to use them. \"Faith-based organisations have a proven ability to reweave the fabric of distressed communities and they deserve support from government.\" And tomorrow the prime minister will promise it to them here. Addressing a conference of the Christian Socialist Movement, with other faiths in attendance, he will praise the good churches can do in community renewal and the value of church schools. Competing with William Hague, he will claim Labour values are closest to Christian values. True, according to Mori. The Church of England is no longer the Tory party at prayer: only 26% of its members vote Tory, 48% Labour. Among Roman Catholics only 17% are Tory, with 48% Labour. In this country the far right evangelicals are still a minority. </p> <p>But mixing God and politics is a perilous business. If the PM's text is not well-worded he may risk the WI slow hand-clap. These are socialists who may question his Christian values from the left: members are pressing for a narrowing of the now widening gap between rich and poor. But outside the hall, the great agnostic/atheist British majority has a queasy distaste for politicians airing religious sentiments: it only fuels their cynicism. </p> <p>At a breakfast this week, the Bishop of Liverpool and the Reverend Steve Chalke explained their pitch to the prime minister for tomorrow's conference. Churches do community best, with the best volunteers and the best schools, the \"faith dollar\" goes further and they want more social funding. Chalke wants the prime minister to stop \"hard left Labour councils\" refusing to fund faith groups on the grounds that church groups only employ their own church members and Christian school teachers. Faith groups only work, he says, because they are all believers. He is not polite about \"state\" employees, as if they were clock-watching time-servers. </p> <p> Churches attract politicians. Their edifices suggest an important place in communities, for lack of anything else tangible to grasp, despite often empty pews and aged congregations. But founding a national social policy around a church attendance currently at 7.5% (generous estimate) looks implausible. It is another colossal difference with the US which ought to make British politicians more wary of using US social thinkers. Robert Putnam is left of centre and knows Britain (unlike Hague's guru, Marvin Olasky, a bible-belt, anti-welfare anti-abortionist). But even so, Putnam's prescriptions sound essentially alien. His vision of community, for all his denials, looks like a return to the 1950s, women back to Kinder, K\u00fcche, Kirche. His social determinism is out of step with modern times: it looks cynical to want poor people to join churches not because religion is true but because it is good for them. </p> <p>The reason Labour's social policies may work where the old slum clearances failed over the years is because they focus on the people. Funding renewal through partnerships that join up all the local state agencies with voluntary groups is a way of reaching out through every tentacle to all that moves and breathes. Some churches do run brilliant social programmes for drug addicts, the homeless, the young and the old. But religious groups must take their place along with the other voluntary groups - funded and judged according to their results. </p> <p>There is a lot of hocus-pocus talked about community, as if it were magic to be sprinkled about like holy water. Nostalgic for old community values, Putnam recalls the glory days of Elks, Salvation Army, choral societies, scouts and churches. But times change. Creating a new sense of community requires building on people's lives as they are now, the things people want enough to need to band together communally. Community activity always depended on women, but they have now gone out to work instead. </p> <p>But seek out where strangers do still meet and it is still largely parents - mainly mothers - outside school gates, playgroup or playground, at the checkout or the baby clinic. Ask communities now what they need most locally and the first answer is childcare - a guaranteed creche and nursery place for every child. Harriet Harman's recent childcare commission toured the country and that was the universal answer. </p> <p>So if Labour wants to foster a new community spirit, start with beautiful children's palaces, attractive welcoming places, offering every service from ante-natal to after-school clubs. At a stroke it would bring together all parts of the community under one roof, in centres run by and for local parents, the only way to unite all classes, each contributing according to income. These would be the missing social heart-beat in each area, nurturing a multitude of voluntary and self-help groups, clubs, classes and community action, run by faith or non-faith volunteers side by side with professionals. </p> <p>Now that would be community, but it doesn't come cheap. One estimate suggests \u00a310bn for 10,000 centres. Money well spent, it would transform individual lives, binding together isolated families and socially divided communities everywhere. Kick-starting community requires less government angst and more government action. What a manifesto pledge that would be.</p>",

She was dressed as a Pepsi employee, the on-screen audience transfixed by her gyrations in a Pepsi bottling plant. In the cola wars, half the battle is getting your own staff and suppliers on board. The idea is for everyone at work the next day to be buzzing about the Pepsi ads their neighbours, friends and family have pointed out to them. It's a little like the chairman's wife syndrome in corporate advertising. (Yes, it does still exist). Forget about the strategic and creative thinking, the only focus group that can sometimes matter is the wife or immediate family of the client company's senior executives. Maybe that's why we suddenly saw the new American advertising icon and former presidential candidate Bob Dole put in a surprise appearance at the end of the last commercial of the night. I am sure the Britney commercials hit a particular mark - they tried hard enough and at least they replaced the always ambiguous \"Joy of Cola\" with the \"Joy of Pepsi\". But on the night they were blown away by a delightfully original New Jersey skit on Budweiser's \"Whassup?\" campaign - \"How you doin'?\" - from DDB Chicago and the team behind the Sopranos. Next year, however, advertisers and broadcasters alike will be hoping for more of a blockbuster year than this, when the pre-night favourite was Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, a foreign, subtitled movie. That it did not win was irrelevant to the ratings, which were down 16% on last year to 23.7m households. Even Gladiator lacks the viewer appeal of say, Titanic, when the whole country had seen it at the movies already. Oscars night needs blockbusters and a little controversy. Britney's belly may be a joy for Pepsi, but it's not enough for the rest of us. \u0095 Stefano Hatfield is managing director and editorial director of Ad Age Global.",

      "bodyText": "Ericsson's UK marketing director Alex Rodrigues is to leave for Singapore as the mobile phone giant takes the axe to 1,200 jobs in the UK. Mr Rodrigues, marketing director for Ericsson UK mobile phones, is to take up a position running the company's accessories business across the Asia-Pacific region. He will be replaced by Steve Walker, Ericsson's UK marketing director of future technology and business development. Mr Walker's new title will be director of marketing and new business for consumer products. But there is widespread speculation that Ericsson's marketing teams will come under close scrutiny and will possibly be restructured as the company tries to slash \u00a31.36bn from its annual costs. Yesterday it announced the closure of plants in Carlton, Nottingham and Scunthorpe. The value of other non-manufacturing roles such as marketing will be reassessed as Ericsson faces up to slower than expected mobile phone sales. Last month Ericsson global vice-president of marketing Jan Ahrenbring left the company and was replaced by Philip Vanhoutte.

      "body": "<p>Should the National Theatre have put on My Fair Lady in a co-production with commercial producer Cameron Mackintosh? And should its artistic director, Trevor Nunn, personally profit from the show's transfer to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in July? Criticisms of Nunn and the National were voiced in press reports over the weekend, and yesterday Nunn broke his silence on the issue to condemn what he called \"the age-old journalistic device of slur through innuendo\". </p> <p>Nunn focused on a report in the Observer in which two regional theatre heads - Jenny Stephens at the Swan Theatre in Worcester and Venu Dhupa at Nottingham Playhouse - attacked the National for putting on such blatantly commercial work. \"There is nothing wrong with being accessible,\" said Stephens, \"but you should be innovative too if you are being subsidised by the public.\" </p> <p>Dhupa singled out the way in which Nunn will benefit financially from the transfer to the West End. \"I could not live with that on my conscience,\" she said. </p> <p>Nunn is furious at the suggestion that personal profit was a motive for directing My Fair Lady. \"It has been the custom and practice in the theatre for several decades that those individuals creatively responsible for a work that transfers from the subsidised sector to the commercial sector should be free to negotiate their arrangements with the commercial producer,\" he says. \"I have been determined from the outset that whatever happens in such royalty negotiations, the result must be to the advantage of the National Theatre. Therefore, my contract with the National provides that if one of my productions transfers, my representative would negotiate unfettered ... Any monies to be received by me are to be divided between the National Theatre and myself in such a way that, of all the production royalty recipients, the National is the highest. Through this arrangement, the National Theatre is rewarded potentially at a higher level than might otherwise have been achieved.\" </p> <p>Yet since the National will receive \u00a314.2m from the Arts Council next year, it should also be obliged to account to the public. Despite Nunn's remarks yesterday, there remains a reluctance to discuss precise figures. Cast members can expect to earn more during the West End run than they will get on the South Bank, while Nunn and the National are likely to receive a royalty and a share of profits. If the show runs for several years, as has happened with transfers such as An Inspector Calls and Copenhagen, those profits could be very substantial. </p> <p>My Fair Lady, which opened a fortnight ago to largely favourable reviews, cost around \u00a31.25m to stage. Mackintosh, who owns the rights to the show, put up half. He will pay the entire cost of the West End transfer, which is estimated at \u00a32.5m. It will have a 17-week run at the National before transferring to the Theatre Royal. The first three months of the West End run are already virtually sold out, with takings nudging \u00a35m. </p> <p>The utilitarian argument for the co-production is that everyone benefits. The National has a sell-out four-month run and a nice little earner thereafter; Nunn has extra income to supplement what a spokeswoman for the National implied to the London Evening Standard this week was the laughable salary of \"less than \u00a3120,000 a year\"; and Mackintosh has a bankable show that gets the kick-start of a high-profile debut at Britain's premier theatrical venue. </p> <p>Mackintosh and Nunn demonstrated the potency of their theatrical magic in 1985 with Les Mis\u00e9rables, which was staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company, with Nunn as artistic director, before transferring to the West End. It has been earning the RSC almost \u00a31m a year in royalty fees ever since. Nunn has done pretty well out of it too: the Observer estimated his royalty earnings last year at \u00a31.4m, though a large slice of that is accounted for by Cats, which is soon to celebrate its 20th year in the West End and was produced entirely within the commercial sector. </p> <p>\"Cameron Mackintosh doesn't benefit from My Fair Lady's run at the National, and he bears all the costs of the transfer,\" says the National's head of press, Lucinda Morrison. \"We are not a repertory theatre, and we can't keep productions in the repertoire forever. It is in our interest to transfer successful productions. We get the best deal we can and take no further risk.\" </p> <p>\"The National will be on a very healthy royalty,\" says Nick Allott, managing director of Cameron Mackintosh Ltd. \"It's an excellent example of the public-private partnership, which the government is so keen on.\" </p> <p>Nunn, who has had to withstand constant criticism of his alleged commercialism at the National, gave an impassioned defence of his record yesterday. \"Subsidy has not been used to produce commercial theatre,\" he said. \"On the contrary, the investment in the show made by the National Theatre will provide an opportunity for the National subsequently to benefit, thus helping its subsidy position.\" He refers to the \"13 major awards\" won in the past year and recites the roster of forthcoming productions, though no mention is made of the production of another musical, South Pacific, which he is scheduled to direct for the National this autumn. That show will give further ammunition to his critics, especially if there is more backing from Macintosh and another West End transfer. </p> <p>Nunn's unpopularity in some theatrical quarters has certainly contributed to the back-biting over My Fair Lady. \"This wouldn't have been raised if there wasn't so much dissatisfaction with the way Nunn has been running the National,\" says one theatre critic. \"There is a feeling among some writers that the National is not for them. Nunn is good at big, showy shows, but has no particular flair for contemporary theatre.\" </p> <p>\"I think it's fine for him to produce My Fair Lady,\" says Tom Morris, artistic director of Battersea Arts Centre, \"but what is worrying is the way he seems to lack conviction in his support for the young artists he wants to bring on. I'm delighted that the National does high-quality popular shows, and he's certainly very good at these, but I wish he'd spend a bit more of his energy supporting the next generation of artists.\" </p> <p>The arguments over Nunn's artistic stewardship are pressing, given that his contract expires next year. It is not yet clear whether he will offer himself for another five years in the most exposed job in British theatre, though he has backtracked on earlier statements that he would definitely step down. Nunn appears to have a unique ability to polarise theatrical opinion, and the arguments over My Fair Lady may yet prove to be merely a rehearsal for the bigger showdown ahead. And, no, it won't be lovely.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The government last night cleared the way for a full-scale vaccination programme to combat the foot and mouth epidemic by seeking EU permission to create \"firewalls\" against the spread of the disease. Nick Brown, the minister of agriculture, said the final decision had yet to be made.</p> <p>In a second move that will change market towns for ever, the government also announced restrictions on the movement of animals - mainly sheep whose undocumented sale and resale helped to spread the disease.</p> <p>In future they will not be shipped round the country from market to market but will have to stay on one farm for 20 days to prevent the rapid spread of disease. Pigswill will also be banned.</p> <p>In a long Commons statement, Mr Brown ran through the massive programme now under way to curtail the epidemic. With the crisis unabated, Tony Blair and his ministers are still hesitating between a May 3 and June 7 general election and for the first time yesterday Downing Street admitted that options for postponing the May 3 local elections are being considered.</p> <p>In a further sign that the government is having to rethink its strategy, Mr Brown gave his strongest hint that the census will not go ahead on April 29, four days before the planned local elections.</p> <p>He told MPs: \"The census is not under way yet, but we are keeping the issue under review. Nothing should be done that will risk the spread of the disease and that includes inappropriate movements on farms.\" The census was last delayed in 1941.</p> <p>Facing a subdued and despairing Commons, the minister stressed that \"vaccination is not an easy option\" and could delay full return to disease-free status and the export market. He said his representative on the EU's standing veterinary committee was seeking a \"contingent decision\" permitting vaccination \"so that it can be deployed immediately if we conclude that it is the right approach\".</p> <p>Without endorsing any of the theories behind the out break - which Mr Brown called \"unprecedented internationally\" in its speed and scale - the minister conceded that one explanation could be \"illegal commercial imports of meat where the contents have not been declared\".</p> <p>Controls, currently made on only 20% of meat imports, will be tightened. That was as close as he got to acknowledging reports that waste from a Chinese restaurant were used in pigswill at the farm in Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland, where the original outbreak is believed to have gone unreported for up to three weeks.</p> <p>With MPs muttering in dismay, the minister pinpointed sheep \"criss-crossing the country in hundreds of separate movements\". Tracking sheep movements had proved difficult, if not impossible.</p> <p>As Tory MPs repeated claims that the disease had emerged before the first reported case on February 19, Mr Brown derided \"urban myths\" about the outbreak, including reports that ministry officials knew about the disease earlier but concealed it.</p> <p>Mr Brown was attacked by his Tory shadow, Tim Yeo, for failing to act promptly enough to halt the spread of the disease - 693 confirmed cases by last night, including 44 yesterday, with only 423,000 of the 719,000 animals authorised for slaughter killed so far.</p> <p>That drew Tory taunts that at the current slaughter rate of 31,000 a day, it will take more than a week to clear the backlog alone.</p> <p>Mr Brown said the slaughter delay was mainly in Cumbria. \"I believe that our policy of containment of the disease is the right one and that the massive logistical exercise required to implement it is being reinforced. The measures we have announced today will ensure we learn the lessons and minimise the risks of such a tragedy in the future.\"</p> <p>Mr Brown revealed that the government had set aside a further \u00a3200m for sheep farmers who were applying for their animals to be slaughtered as part of the welfare scheme. Hundreds of sheep are lambing on the fells but cannot be moved because of restrictions. Farmers will get 90% of pre-foot and mouth prices.</p> <p>Officials later said that vaccinated animals, killed to slow the spread and create \"firewalls\", need not be slaughtered, but that could delay restoration of the country's disease-free status from three months to 12. Officials say the overall cost of vaccination would be \u00a35 a shot.</p> <p>In the high court yesterday, Peter Kindersley, the publishing entrepreneur who is also a farmer, asked for a judicial review of the government's slaughter policy for healthy animals, claiming it was illegal.</p> <p>In Northern Ireland, where there has been only a single case of foot and mouth, farmers were given the go-ahead to export dairy and meat products from most of the country to the EU next month, provided there are no further outbreaks.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/subsection/0,7370,463511,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a><br></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459872,00.html\">20.03.2001: Looking forward to easter, nervously</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html  \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

      "bodyText": "The government last night cleared the way for a full-scale vaccination programme to combat the foot and mouth epidemic by seeking EU permission to create \"firewalls\" against the spread of the disease. Nick Brown, the minister of agriculture, said the final decision had yet to be made. In a second move that will change market towns for ever, the government also announced restrictions on the movement of animals - mainly sheep whose undocumented sale and resale helped to spread the disease. In future they will not be shipped round the country from market to market but will have to stay on one farm for 20 days to prevent the rapid spread of disease. Pigswill will also be banned. In a long Commons statement, Mr Brown ran through the massive programme now under way to curtail the epidemic. With the crisis unabated, Tony Blair and his ministers are still hesitating between a May 3 and June 7 general election and for the first time yesterday Downing Street admitted that options for postponing the May 3 local elections are being considered. In a further sign that the government is having to rethink its strategy, Mr Brown gave his strongest hint that the census will not go ahead on April 29, four days before the planned local elections. He told MPs: \"The census is not under way yet, but we are keeping the issue under review. Nothing should be done that will risk the spread of the disease and that includes inappropriate movements on farms.\" The census was last delayed in 1941. Facing a subdued and despairing Commons, the minister stressed that \"vaccination is not an easy option\" and could delay full return to disease-free status and the export market. He said his representative on the EU's standing veterinary committee was seeking a \"contingent decision\" permitting vaccination \"so that it can be deployed immediately if we conclude that it is the right approach\". Without endorsing any of the theories behind the out break - which Mr Brown called \"unprecedented internationally\" in its speed and scale - the minister conceded that one explanation could be \"illegal commercial imports of meat where the contents have not been declared\". Controls, currently made on only 20% of meat imports, will be tightened. That was as close as he got to acknowledging reports that waste from a Chinese restaurant were used in pigswill at the farm in Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland, where the original outbreak is believed to have gone unreported for up to three weeks. With MPs muttering in dismay, the minister pinpointed sheep \"criss-crossing the country in hundreds of separate movements\". Tracking sheep movements had proved difficult, if not impossible. As Tory MPs repeated claims that the disease had emerged before the first reported case on February 19, Mr Brown derided \"urban myths\" about the outbreak, including reports that ministry officials knew about the disease earlier but concealed it. Mr Brown was attacked by his Tory shadow, Tim Yeo, for failing to act promptly enough to halt the spread of the disease - 693 confirmed cases by last night, including 44 yesterday, with only 423,000 of the 719,000 animals authorised for slaughter killed so far. That drew Tory taunts that at the current slaughter rate of 31,000 a day, it will take more than a week to clear the backlog alone. Mr Brown said the slaughter delay was mainly in Cumbria. \"I believe that our policy of containment of the disease is the right one and that the massive logistical exercise required to implement it is being reinforced. The measures we have announced today will ensure we learn the lessons and minimise the risks of such a tragedy in the future.\" Mr Brown revealed that the government had set aside a further \u00a3200m for sheep farmers who were applying for their animals to be slaughtered as part of the welfare scheme. Hundreds of sheep are lambing on the fells but cannot be moved because of restrictions. Farmers will get 90% of pre-foot and mouth prices. Officials later said that vaccinated animals, killed to slow the spread and create \"firewalls\", need not be slaughtered, but that could delay restoration of the country's disease-free status from three months to 12. Officials say the overall cost of vaccination would be \u00a35 a shot. In the high court yesterday, Peter Kindersley, the publishing entrepreneur who is also a farmer, asked for a judicial review of the government's slaughter policy for healthy animals, claiming it was illegal. In Northern Ireland, where there has been only a single case of foot and mouth, farmers were given the go-ahead to export dairy and meat products from most of the country to the EU next month, provided there are no further outbreaks.

This was out of a total budget of \u00a3341m, so it represented roughly a third of spending. Set against that, it paid out \u00a324m in council tax benefit.

He claims it is unfair to compare collection costs of a property-based tax with others. \"Property taxes are always more difficult to collect,\" he says. \"Council taxes are collected from individuals, who move around. Property taxes are more expensive because employers and businesses do a lot of the work done by the inland revenue and customs &amp; excise.\" </p> <p>And Briscoe insists that the council tax regime - collecting the tax and paying out a benefit designed especially for it - is not a mere job creation scheme for council staff. \"We're trying to encourage councils to work together on back-office systems to reduce the costs of collection,\" he says. \"Every local authority in the country would rather spend some of that cost on providing better services.\" </p> <p>Briscoe dismisses any notion that local taxation should be abolished. He defends council tax as a necessary link between local voters and the services their elected councillors deliver. A local tax is a vital part of democracy, he insists. In fact, he believes that the local tax should represent a higher proportion of council income, claiming that the sometimes huge sums which councils get from central government undermine the link between voters and local leaders. \"It disconnects the people when they vote from what happens on the ground,\" he says. </p> <p>In the good old days, Briscoe recalls, councils collected their rates and the business rates. Some councils - Hertfordshire for one, he reckons - collected so much in local taxation that they did not receive a penny from central government. Now councils collect the business rate replacement, but hand over all the cash to Whitehall to have it redistributed as grant. And that grant formula, based on a set of statistics that the government of the day has been known to change to favour councils of its own political complexion, in effect sets the local councils' budgets. </p> <p>Briscoe maintains that if councils did collect a bigger proportion of their income, costs would not rise accordingly. Ideally, however, he would favour a different form of taxation. \"I would prefer there to be a local income tax, collected locally,\" he says. \"Then the link between local government and the taxpayer would be stronger. </p> <p>\"More of the tax should be raised locally so that more of the tax is related to the amount spent locally.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Turnout is likely to be low at the next general election, particularly in safe Labour seats, but does Labour need to worry?</p> <p>Turnout tends to be low if people think that there is going to be an easy victory. The highest turnouts have all come at very closely fought elections, notably 1950 and 1951, when turnout exceeded 80%. Similarly the close races in February 1974 and April 1992 stimulated high turnouts of 79% and 78%.</p> <p>If Labour support evaporates in the next few weeks, as it did during the petrol protests last autumn, the prospect of a close race may galvanise voters. But at present I would expect a low turnout, below the 71.6% recorded in 1997, which was itself the lowest in the post-war period.</p> <p>The problem will be compounded in safe Labour seats. At least in 1997 there was the excitement of at last getting rid of the Tories. But that motive no longer holds. Received wisdom suggests low polls are worse news for Labour than for the Tories. It is at best a half truth. Labour supporters are slightly less likely to turn out and vote than Tory or Liberal Democrat supporters - one reason why the Labour lead at the next election is likely to be distinctly lower than their lead now in the opinion polls, just as it was in 1997.</p> <p>But lower turnout among Labour supporters is a longstanding feature that held true in previous general elections and there is little evidence that the gap widens when overall turnout falls (at least in the case of general elections). When overall turnout falls, as it did between 1992 and 1997, it tends to fall equally among all groups of party supporters. So turnout tends not to affect the swing. Only once - in 1970 - has there been a clear case where the Labour turnout slipped markedly more than turnout for other parties. It is is a rather important exception since it lost Labour an election they had been confident of winning.</p> <p>A low turnout caused by feelings that the result was a foregone conclusion would not in itself constitute a worry for Labour, since it will affect Tory supporters in much the same way.

      "bodyText": "Turnout is likely to be low at the next general election, particularly in safe Labour seats, but does Labour need to worry? Turnout tends to be low if people think that there is going to be an easy victory. The highest turnouts have all come at very closely fought elections, notably 1950 and 1951, when turnout exceeded 80%. Similarly the close races in February 1974 and April 1992 stimulated high turnouts of 79% and 78%. If Labour support evaporates in the next few weeks, as it did during the petrol protests last autumn, the prospect of a close race may galvanise voters. But at present I would expect a low turnout, below the 71.6% recorded in 1997, which was itself the lowest in the post-war period. The problem will be compounded in safe Labour seats. At least in 1997 there was the excitement of at last getting rid of the Tories. But that motive no longer holds. Received wisdom suggests low polls are worse news for Labour than for the Tories. It is at best a half truth. Labour supporters are slightly less likely to turn out and vote than Tory or Liberal Democrat supporters - one reason why the Labour lead at the next election is likely to be distinctly lower than their lead now in the opinion polls, just as it was in 1997. But lower turnout among Labour supporters is a longstanding feature that held true in previous general elections and there is little evidence that the gap widens when overall turnout falls (at least in the case of general elections). When overall turnout falls, as it did between 1992 and 1997, it tends to fall equally among all groups of party supporters. So turnout tends not to affect the swing. Only once - in 1970 - has there been a clear case where the Labour turnout slipped markedly more than turnout for other parties. It is is a rather important exception since it lost Labour an election they had been confident of winning. A low turnout caused by feelings that the result was a foregone conclusion would not in itself constitute a worry for Labour, since it will affect Tory supporters in much the same way. But could 2001 see a rerun of 1970, with disillusioned traditional Labour supporters failing to turn out? On the face of it this is pretty unlikely. In 1970 Harold Wilson's government was plagued by charges that he had betrayed socialist principles and by failures to look after working-class interests when in office. It was this kind of accusation that led Tony Blair to get his betrayal in first as soon as he won the party leadership, abolishing clause four and moving the Labour party to the centre of the political spectrum. Traditional Labour supporters may not be enthused by New Labour's performance in office, but the performance cannot have been much of a surprise to them. Our research on the 1997 election shows that they were already clearly aware how much Labour had moved to the centre; back in 1997 there was not the same growth in enthusiasm for New Labour among traditional working-class supporters as there was among middle-class converts. So in a sense any harm that would have fallen New Labour on this score will al ready have happened in 1997. This is a completely different scenario from 1970, which followed the 1966 election where there had been substantial working-class enthusiasm for Labour. We must avoid double-counting.

Why do we need one?</p> <p>One point often made by the go-go-go brigade in recent weeks is that Ted Heath went to the country in February 1974, during a miners' strike. This is a false analogy: Heath called that election not in spite of the emergency but because of it.

We would be saying to foreigners: Do not come here and spend your money.\" John Prescott, John Reid and Clive Soley agree, as do most leader-writers. \"There can be no delay at the polls,\" the Independent on Sunday insists. \"It would send out a misleadingly alarming signal to the rest of the world.\"</p> <p>The language is baffling (how can the PM \"postpone\" or \"delay\" an election that hasn't been called?), and the hyperbole downright ridiculous. Foreigners may well be frightened by our foot and mouth epidemic, but do the eccentricities of our electoral system influence their holiday plans? I'm reminded of FE Smith's allegation that the Welsh disestablishment bill had \"shocked the conscience of every Christian community in Europe\" - a comment which provoked GK Chesterton's famous retort: \"Chuck it, Smith!\" From Connecticut to Cape Town, if Messrs Prescott, Reid and Soley are to be believed, anxious souls are ready to cancel their London holidays if Blair decides to serve the full five years for which he was elected in 1997.</p> <p>The idea is manifestly incredible. Why, then, must we have an early election? One genuine reason was blurted out by Jack Straw recently, when a BBC interviewer pointed out that Labour had not halved the time between arrest and sentencing of young offenders - even though this was one of the five \"key pledges\" printed on pocket-sized cards in 1997 so that voters \"can see we keep our promises\". Ah yes, the home secretary replied, but if you read the small print you'll find that we promised to achieve that only \"over a five-year term\".</p> <p>But this alone is scarcely a sufficient explanation for the Blairites' urgent desire to go to the polls after only four years. A more obvious motive, which no minister dares admit, is fear of an economic downturn. Japan and the US are already on the brink of recession; in an era of globalised goods and capital it's difficult to see how Britain can escape infection for long. Gordon Brown's favourite mantra - \"there can be no return to boom and bust\" - might soon be greeted with the howls of derision it so richly deserves.</p> <p>New Labour promised from the outset that it would not use budgetary policy to regulate demand. This left the Treasury with only one economic lever - control of interest rates. But Brown promptly abdicated responsibility for that too. His policy - or, rather, non-policy - consists of little more than watching the financial markets and hoping for the best. Thanks to this neo-liberal nonsense, we are almost wholly undefended against the virus now afflicting America and Japan.</p> <p>Hence the note of panic one detects in ministers and their media friends as they plead with Blair not to \"delay\". To paraphrase Karl Marx: it's the economy, stupid. The modernisers of New Labour are exploiting an ancient British tradition which one might call the second-hand car dealer's dodge: complete the sale on a wheezing old jalopy before it breaks down.</p> <p>Quite why a democracy should permit one side in an electoral contest to rig the ballot in this fashion has always mystified me. One of the original demands of the 19th century Chartists was for a new parliament to be elected every year on the first Monday in June. \"We may nowadays laugh,\" Julius West wrote in his History of the Chartist Movement, \"at the state of mind which could contemplate with equanimity, indeed with pleasure, the prospect of an annual general election.\" Maybe so, but the essential principle was sound enough and has lately been revived by Tony Wright MP. Under his fixed-term parliaments bill, introduced in the Commons on March 1, there would be an election every four years - no more, no less - except if the ruling party suffers a vote of no-confidence in the house.</p> <p>Ministers will have some difficulty in arguing against the proposal, especially since they imposed just such a system on the Scottish parliament. If it's good enough for the Scots, why not for the rest of us? The bill's second reading is due on Friday April 6 - which may be yet another reason for Blair to dispatch MPs to the hustings before then. As Wright points out, the Labour party used to be committed to a fixed-term parliament. \"I'm not sure why we are no longer in favour,\" he said recently, \"apart from our being in power.\"</p> <p>Er, quite.</p> <p><b>Byers bullies sellers but fights shy of Bowers</b><br></p> <p>A headline in the Sunday Telegraph reveals that \"Taxpayer will fund Byers libel fight\". Maddeningly, it doesn't say which particular taxpayer has been chosen for this honour. Geoffrey Robinson, perhaps?</p> <p>In my rare sightings of him, Stephen Byers has always seemed an amiable if uninteresting chap: \"Mandelson-Lite\", as someone called him. Now that he is sending minatory letters to blameless booksellers, this verdict may have to be reviewed. It is only bullies such as Jimmy Goldsmith who threaten mere distributors. How can newsagents or bookshop managers possibly vet everything that they sell? If the trade secretary thinks he has been defamed he should sue Tom Bower, author of The Paymaster.</p> <p>Bower claims that Geoffrey Robinson was paid \u00a3200,000 by one of Robert Maxwell's companies, Hollis. No great shame in that: if everyone who took the Maxwell shilling was obliged to retire in disgrace, there would be many empty desks in Fleet Street, the City and Westminster. Robinson's offence was to deny the Maxwell payment. Like Peter on the night of Jesus's betrayal, he swore: \"I know not the man.\" Yea, and he denied him thrice - to the House of Commons, to the prime minister and in his memoirs.</p> <p>And the cock crew. And a DTI investigator found documentary evidence of the \u00a3200,000 cheque. And Byers, who had previously promised to be \"as open as possible on these matters\", slipped a written answer into Hansard on December 21 1999 (when everyone was preoccupied with Christmas parties) saying that the Hollis inquiry was now over and no further action would be taken.</p> <p>Byers is furious at Bower's suggestion that he \"buried\" the report, insisting that he delegated the decision to civil servants. If so, he could become the first cabinet minister in history to demand libel damages for an allegation that he was responsible for the actions of his own department. Is it any wonder that, so far, he has been all mouth and no writ?</p>",

Foreigners may well be frightened by our foot and mouth epidemic, but do the eccentricities of our electoral system influence their holiday plans? I'm reminded of FE Smith's allegation that the Welsh disestablishment bill had \"shocked the conscience of every Christian community in Europe\" - a comment which provoked GK Chesterton's famous retort: \"Chuck it, Smith!\" From Connecticut to Cape Town, if Messrs Prescott, Reid and Soley are to be believed, anxious souls are ready to cancel their London holidays if Blair decides to serve the full five years for which he was elected in 1997. The idea is manifestly incredible. Why, then, must we have an early election? One genuine reason was blurted out by Jack Straw recently, when a BBC interviewer pointed out that Labour had not halved the time between arrest and sentencing of young offenders - even though this was one of the five \"key pledges\" printed on pocket-sized cards in 1997 so that voters \"can see we keep our promises\". Ah yes, the home secretary replied, but if you read the small print you'll find that we promised to achieve that only \"over a five-year term\". But this alone is scarcely a sufficient explanation for the Blairites' urgent desire to go to the polls after only four years. A more obvious motive, which no minister dares admit, is fear of an economic downturn. Japan and the US are already on the brink of recession; in an era of globalised goods and capital it's difficult to see how Britain can escape infection for long. Gordon Brown's favourite mantra - \"there can be no return to boom and bust\" - might soon be greeted with the howls of derision it so richly deserves. New Labour promised from the outset that it would not use budgetary policy to regulate demand. This left the Treasury with only one economic lever - control of interest rates. But Brown promptly abdicated responsibility for that too. His policy - or, rather, non-policy - consists of little more than watching the financial markets and hoping for the best. Thanks to this neo-liberal nonsense, we are almost wholly undefended against the virus now afflicting America and Japan. Hence the note of panic one detects in ministers and their media friends as they plead with Blair not to \"delay\". To paraphrase Karl Marx: it's the economy, stupid. The modernisers of New Labour are exploiting an ancient British tradition which one might call the second-hand car dealer's dodge: complete the sale on a wheezing old jalopy before it breaks down. Quite why a democracy should permit one side in an electoral contest to rig the ballot in this fashion has always mystified me. One of the original demands of the 19th century Chartists was for a new parliament to be elected every year on the first Monday in June. \"We may nowadays laugh,\" Julius West wrote in his History of the Chartist Movement, \"at the state of mind which could contemplate with equanimity, indeed with pleasure, the prospect of an annual general election.\" Maybe so, but the essential principle was sound enough and has lately been revived by Tony Wright MP. Under his fixed-term parliaments bill, introduced in the Commons on March 1, there would be an election every four years - no more, no less - except if the ruling party suffers a vote of no-confidence in the house. Ministers will have some difficulty in arguing against the proposal, especially since they imposed just such a system on the Scottish parliament. If it's good enough for the Scots, why not for the rest of us? The bill's second reading is due on Friday April 6 - which may be yet another reason for Blair to dispatch MPs to the hustings before then. As Wright points out, the Labour party used to be committed to a fixed-term parliament. \"I'm not sure why we are no longer in favour,\" he said recently, \"apart from our being in power.\" Er, quite. Byers bullies sellers but fights shy of Bowers A headline in the Sunday Telegraph reveals that \"Taxpayer will fund Byers libel fight\". Maddeningly, it doesn't say which particular taxpayer has been chosen for this honour. Geoffrey Robinson, perhaps? In my rare sightings of him, Stephen Byers has always seemed an amiable if uninteresting chap: \"Mandelson-Lite\", as someone called him. Now that he is sending minatory letters to blameless booksellers, this verdict may have to be reviewed. It is only bullies such as Jimmy Goldsmith who threaten mere distributors. How can newsagents or bookshop managers possibly vet everything that they sell? If the trade secretary thinks he has been defamed he should sue Tom Bower, author of The Paymaster. Bower claims that Geoffrey Robinson was paid \u00a3200,000 by one of Robert Maxwell's companies, Hollis. No great shame in that: if everyone who took the Maxwell shilling was obliged to retire in disgrace, there would be many empty desks in Fleet Street, the City and Westminster. Robinson's offence was to deny the Maxwell payment. Like Peter on the night of Jesus's betrayal, he swore: \"I know not the man.\" Yea, and he denied him thrice - to the House of Commons, to the prime minister and in his memoirs. And the cock crew. And a DTI investigator found documentary evidence of the \u00a3200,000 cheque. And Byers, who had previously promised to be \"as open as possible on these matters\", slipped a written answer into Hansard on December 21 1999 (when everyone was preoccupied with Christmas parties) saying that the Hollis inquiry was now over and no further action would be taken. Byers is furious at Bower's suggestion that he \"buried\" the report, insisting that he delegated the decision to civil servants. If so, he could become the first cabinet minister in history to demand libel damages for an allegation that he was responsible for the actions of his own department. Is it any wonder that, so far, he has been all mouth and no writ?",

      "bodyText": "Keith Vaz, the minister for Europe embroiled in controversy with the parliamentary standards watchdog and links with the Hinduja brothers, is today sharply criticised by MPs on quite a different issue - failing to grasp \"policy issues\" relating to the Balkans. He is singled out in a report by the Labour-dominated Commons foreign affairs committee which adds that it was \"deeply regrettable\" Mr Vaz had not even visited the region. Mr Vaz's \"evidence session with us did not reveal a detailed grasp of the policy issues which the area faces\", the committee says. It adds pointedly: \"As the minister told us, and we know ourselves, the situation in the Balkans is 'very complex and and very difficult'. Visiting the region puts this situation into context\". It also rebukes Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, for not visiting Yugoslavia. The committee's report was seized on by the Tories who said it showed that Mr Vaz was unfit for office. \"This report is an indictment of Mr Vaz's work rate and intellectual calibre. It is also an indictment of Tony Blair's judgment,\" said the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude. In the Com mons yesterday, Mr Maude provoked an angry foreign secretary over the Balkans by saying that while there should be \"resolute support\" for Macedonia, there should be no question of Kosovo being denied the right of eventual \"self determination\". Mr Cook snapped back: \"The last message the government of Macedonia wants to hear at the present time is a call for the independence of Kosovo which has just been made by you.\" Western leaders do not say it openly now but there are are few who doubt that Kosovo will one day achieve independence from Serbia.

He is known to be sympathetic to initiatives that give officers more freedom to tackle serious crime.</p> <p>If the scheme is a success other areas might follow suit.</p> <p>Commander Paddick said yesterday the proposal did not mean cannabis was being legalised. The idea was to free his officers from spending hours mopping up minor drugs offences when they needed time to tackle the \"cancer\" of crack cocaine-related crime.</p> <p>\"I've never met anyone who had to commit crime to fund a cannabis habit, but crack cocaine users commit robbery, burglary and car crime.\"</p> <p>He said he was not soft on cannabis use. \"That completely misrepresents what we want to do. We believe this policy will continue to deter people buying cannabis on the streets, as they will still lose even small amounts of cannabis in their possession. The person has to accept the warning, [or] be arrested.\"</p> <p>It takes two officers up to five hours to process a cannabis possession arrest. \"With the new policy, we can deal with a similar matter in 10 minutes,\" said Cdr Paddick.</p> <p>His proposal has been forwarded to the community police consultative group in Lambeth. Jennifer Douglas, its chairwoman, said: \"It is a brave idea, and it is a good idea. There is a need for a new drugs strategy.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Metropolitan police may become the first force in the country to officially relax its attitude towards cannabis possession, after a decision to pursue a radical policy in a London hotspot for drugs. Working within discretionary powers given by the Home Office, the borough commander for Lambeth, Brian Paddick, has drawn up proposals to issue warnings to people caught with cannabis, rather than automatically making arrests and, in some cases, bringing charges. Although the policy will affect only one borough, which includes Brixton, the Met commissioner, Sir John Stevens, is watching with interest to gauge public reaction. He is known to be sympathetic to initiatives that give officers more freedom to tackle serious crime. If the scheme is a success other areas might follow suit. Commander Paddick said yesterday the proposal did not mean cannabis was being legalised. The idea was to free his officers from spending hours mopping up minor drugs offences when they needed time to tackle the \"cancer\" of crack cocaine-related crime. \"I've never met anyone who had to commit crime to fund a cannabis habit, but crack cocaine users commit robbery, burglary and car crime.\" He said he was not soft on cannabis use. \"That completely misrepresents what we want to do. We believe this policy will continue to deter people buying cannabis on the streets, as they will still lose even small amounts of cannabis in their possession. The person has to accept the warning, [or] be arrested.\" It takes two officers up to five hours to process a cannabis possession arrest. \"With the new policy, we can deal with a similar matter in 10 minutes,\" said Cdr Paddick. His proposal has been forwarded to the community police consultative group in Lambeth. Jennifer Douglas, its chairwoman, said: \"It is a brave idea, and it is a good idea. There is a need for a new drugs strategy.\"",

The report by the Commons health select committee examined whether the health secretary, Alan Milburn, has achieved his self-imposed pledge to take public health \"out of the ghetto\". It says that while ministers had a well-intentioned commitment to push public health issues \"up the agenda\", in practice acute care issues such as beds and staff shortages still dominated policy. It adds that there is \"confusion\" surrounding the leadership of the public health function from ministerial level down through regional and local levels. The report says: \"We found that the present policy agenda is heavily dominated by the NHS plan with its overwhelming concentration on acute care, hospitals and beds, and numbers of doctors and nurses. \"We accept these are issues of vital importance to the NHS but we think the case for re-balancing health policy is strong.\" The government should make health improvement \"a central priority\" and give more power to the public health minister to reduce health inequalities, the report concludes. It says: \"Our final verdict must be that many of the [government's] itiatives have been taken with the best of intentions, but their multiplicity and lack of rigour threatens to undermine them. \"We have found blurred lines of responsibility leading to disputes over who should have responsibility for public health function.\" The role of regional and local public health professionals should be clarified, while stronger partnership working between health, local government and the voluntary sector should be encouraged, it says.

The company was founded in 1998 and has more than 250,000 sq ft of warehouse space in three locations serving Britain and mainland Europe.",

IPC said Ms Jones was leaving the company \"to spend more time writing for magazines and the national press\". She is to be replaced by Marie O'Riordan, group publishing director for Emap's youth titles and a former editor of Elle, prompting speculation that IPC was in negotiations to secure her before Ms Jones was ordered to leave. A spokeswoman for IPC said Ms Jones had left the company to pursue other interests. But industry sources say the company is keen to reverse the 11% decline in circulation recorded by the magazine at the last ABCs. And the magazine notably failed to win any awards at last night's IPC awards dinner. In a statement, Ms O'Riordan said: \"I am delighted to be following Liz Jones as the editor of such a high-profile, award-winning international brand.\" Ms Jones said she had been \"privileged to work with such a talented and creative group of people\".

The Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints stating the print advert, for Sainsbury's fruit and vegetables, was ambiguous and could mislead shoppers. The advert showed two apples, one beneath the heading \"Pesticide\", the other beneath the heading \"Countryside\". A ladybird was shown crawling on the apple beneath the \"Countryside\" heading. The copy stated: \"All Sainsbury's British fruit and vegetables are grown with a commitment to using more natural farming methods, like this ladybird, to control pests.\" The ASA said the advertisement misleadingly implied Sainsbury's used no pesticides on its fruit. In fact, Sainsbury's merely has a policy of \"encouraging environmentally responsible farming\". The authority asked the supermarket to consult its advisory team before running similar campaigns in the future. But the ASA threw out complaints about a recruitment campaign for the Metropolitan Police being racist. The advert showed a young couple standing outside a house with the statement: \"This couple just had their new year spoiled by burglars\" superimposed over them. The line: \"This is someone who doesn't want to know\" was placed over a black man who was shown walking past the house. And the words: \"This is someone who does\" were placed over a white woman onlooker. The advert stated: \"You could step in here as a special constable and make a real difference.\" The complainants claimed the advert implied white people were more interested in law enforcement than black people. But the Metropolitan Police argued another advert in the campaign showed an Asian woman as the person who wanted to know and a white man as the person who did not. A third showed a black man who wanted to help a pensioner and a white man who did not. The ASA concluded the advert was unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence.",

      "body": "<p>The battle on the West Bank between Israelis and Palestinians is now as familiar as the battle in Britain between those seeking a just analysis of this latest war - and Israel's diehard enemies. The difference is that over there Israel has military superiority yet here Zion's critics have media superiority which they use disproportionately. </p> <p>This pattern is being demonstrated in the Spectator: Lord Gilmour and a posse of well-known journalists attack a lone advocate of balanced coverage of Israel - a typical situation nowadays. Except that this lone defender is the proprietor of the Telegraph-Spectator group, Conrad Black. Since the anti-Zionist lobby is pervasively powerful and since journalists, who have attacked him, continue to write for the Telegraph (making their protestations of \"censorship\" rather rich), this proxy-Palestinian commando is not particularly courageous. The scene more resembles a gladiatorial show in which a bear is attacked by dogs in the Coliseum. </p> <p>But their most powerful weapon is the sniggering of the chattering classes when Black claims the press, including the Guardian, is anti-semitic. \"How clumsy! How absurd!\" They say. \"Not that old chestnut again!\" </p> <p>In fact, the chattering classes are being naive. Most critics of Israel are far from anti-semitic. I myself am proud to support Israel - but, like any democracy, she benefits from criticism and I heartily disapprove of her settlements policies. Most of the media blindly follow the fashion that \"Israel is bad\" out of slavish unoriginality and decent if misguided intentions so those involved in the Spectator affair are doubtless also worthy if confused humanitarians. However I know that others of the most energetic media-campaigners against Israel are, in private, virulent anti-semites. </p> <p> Whether or not the American press is pro-Israeli or merely fair, the British press is neither. If the Telegraph alone is regarded as Israel-friendly, the Guardian leans towards the Israel-phobic - hence I write this with optimistic trepidation. </p> <p>The fashionable menu of shameful lies repeatedly offered in respectable newspapers is long: that Israel is disgusting to employ Arab \"slave labour\" when all capitalist countries (including Britain and especially the Gulf States) employ unskilled workers of different nationalities; that this war is anything other than planned by the Palestinian leadership, as is privately admitted by neighbouring Arab leaders - but not in the British press. There is surely an inverted racism in judging Israel by European standards while never judging the brutal Arab tyrannies, including Arafat's corrupt dictatorship, as responsible for anything. </p> <p>Most wicked is the implication that Israel is replicating German behaviour: this approaches Holocaust denial in its iniquity by deliberately seeking to minimise what happened and exaggerate what is happening. There is no parallel - moral or otherwise - between the tragic deaths of 300 Palestinians killed while attacking Israel with rocks, guns and busbombs, and the industrial slaughter of 6m men, women and children. These are lies promoted by well intentioned media editors whose decency is used (and mocked) by a small group of rabid anti-Zionists who are in fact real anti-semites. </p> <p>There is little British anti-semitism. Descended from immigrants from Morocco, Italy and Russia, I awake every day to thank God that I was born Jewish in Britain. But there are anti-semitic polemicists, who privately hold views which they have aired in my presence: Jews are a dirty, impure, urban infestation. Arabs are a clean, rustic, pure race who possess qualities that Jews do not, a view ideologically descending from the TE Lawrence/ Foreign Office school but with racial elements. </p> <p>Personally, the frequent use of the words \"impure Jewblood\" wounded me - just as I am now shocked to see editors regularly publishing the same characters' frenzied attacks on Israel. I do not like to see public or press mocked by soi-disant saints \"laundering\" disgusting views through respectable newspapers. </p> <p>My aim is not to launch witchhunts, just to warn decent people who unknowingly have some unsavoury bed-fellows. It is time to resuscitate British traditions of scepticism, vigilance of hypocrisy - and fairness. Even for Israel. Most of the water in this well is at least drinkable - but, believe me, there is poison there too. </p> <p>\u0095 The author's Life of Potemkin is published by Weidenfeld and Nicolson</p>",

Since the anti-Zionist lobby is pervasively powerful and since journalists, who have attacked him, continue to write for the Telegraph (making their protestations of \"censorship\" rather rich), this proxy-Palestinian commando is not particularly courageous. The scene more resembles a gladiatorial show in which a bear is attacked by dogs in the Coliseum. But their most powerful weapon is the sniggering of the chattering classes when Black claims the press, including the Guardian, is anti-semitic. \"How clumsy! How absurd!\" They say. \"Not that old chestnut again!\" In fact, the chattering classes are being naive. Most critics of Israel are far from anti-semitic. I myself am proud to support Israel - but, like any democracy, she benefits from criticism and I heartily disapprove of her settlements policies. Most of the media blindly follow the fashion that \"Israel is bad\" out of slavish unoriginality and decent if misguided intentions so those involved in the Spectator affair are doubtless also worthy if confused humanitarians. However I know that others of the most energetic media-campaigners against Israel are, in private, virulent anti-semites. Whether or not the American press is pro-Israeli or merely fair, the British press is neither. If the Telegraph alone is regarded as Israel-friendly, the Guardian leans towards the Israel-phobic - hence I write this with optimistic trepidation. The fashionable menu of shameful lies repeatedly offered in respectable newspapers is long: that Israel is disgusting to employ Arab \"slave labour\" when all capitalist countries (including Britain and especially the Gulf States) employ unskilled workers of different nationalities; that this war is anything other than planned by the Palestinian leadership, as is privately admitted by neighbouring Arab leaders - but not in the British press. There is surely an inverted racism in judging Israel by European standards while never judging the brutal Arab tyrannies, including Arafat's corrupt dictatorship, as responsible for anything. Most wicked is the implication that Israel is replicating German behaviour: this approaches Holocaust denial in its iniquity by deliberately seeking to minimise what happened and exaggerate what is happening. There is no parallel - moral or otherwise - between the tragic deaths of 300 Palestinians killed while attacking Israel with rocks, guns and busbombs, and the industrial slaughter of 6m men, women and children. These are lies promoted by well intentioned media editors whose decency is used (and mocked) by a small group of rabid anti-Zionists who are in fact real anti-semites. There is little British anti-semitism. Descended from immigrants from Morocco, Italy and Russia, I awake every day to thank God that I was born Jewish in Britain. But there are anti-semitic polemicists, who privately hold views which they have aired in my presence: Jews are a dirty, impure, urban infestation. Arabs are a clean, rustic, pure race who possess qualities that Jews do not, a view ideologically descending from the TE Lawrence/ Foreign Office school but with racial elements. Personally, the frequent use of the words \"impure Jewblood\" wounded me - just as I am now shocked to see editors regularly publishing the same characters' frenzied attacks on Israel. I do not like to see public or press mocked by soi-disant saints \"laundering\" disgusting views through respectable newspapers. My aim is not to launch witchhunts, just to warn decent people who unknowingly have some unsavoury bed-fellows. It is time to resuscitate British traditions of scepticism, vigilance of hypocrisy - and fairness. Even for Israel. Most of the water in this well is at least drinkable - but, believe me, there is poison there too. \u0095 The author's Life of Potemkin is published by Weidenfeld and Nicolson",

      "body": "<p>The signs of spring are now unmistakable, but we don't feel much like celebrating and our grass fields remain as bare as boards. Our first lamb arrived on Saturday, followed by another new calf, a red Limousin cross heifer, on Sunday night. The pied wagtails are back but, according to my diary, 13 days later than last year. They are such cheerful little birds, I cannot help smiling when I see them hopping about on the walls and in the sheds.</p> <p>The newest calf arrived at 10pm on Sunday and Peter thought all would be well, but as any farmer can tell you, animals are not always predictable. On Monday morning the calf had not suckled at all. Before breakfast we milked out the mother and fed the calf via a specially designed tube. This is not an easy task. This particular cow kicks like crazy when we milk her, but eventually Peter milked out 1.5 litres - enough to fill the small calf.</p> <p>Two days later, the calf has still not learned to feed herself, so we have to perform this task three times a day. However, the cow has settled slightly and lets us milk her. The prognosis for the calf is not good, but she is warm and fed regularly. There is not much more we can do.</p> <p>Eight sheep lambed on Monday. Our extra staff will arrive today, which will make a big difference. Ian's room is ready for him but we still have to clear the kitchen table of junk mail and a sewing machine in preparation for the constant meals and coffee breaks.</p> <p>I've just been for a quick haircut as I was beginning to resemble Dougal from the Magic Roundabout. It was a wet trim: no time (or money) for a tidy blow-dry. I also got my back straightened at the chiropractor's. Christophe says the strain is written all over our faces, and they can feel it in our spines, too.</p> <p>Peter has just talked to the vet, at the road end. We've been given some medicine for the sickly calf. I hope it helps. Three vets from the practice have now been seconded to Maff in Cumbria and the remaining few are carrying out emergencies only. They will not enter a farm unless absolutely necessary.</p> <p>There have been three new cases in Northumberland. The fear is mounting once again. Just as we get used to coping with the situation, the pressure increases. Maff insists its goal is to slaughter confirmed cases within 24 hours but in the past week in this region, the farmers have had to wait two to three days for a vet to come and a further two to three days for slaughter.</p> <p>We all feel this is unacceptable, and fear what happened in Cumbria will happen here. Our local MP, Peter Atkinson, the NFU and the vets are all pushing Maff as hard as they can. We have to keep up the pressure. There is too much at stake.</p> <p>Michael Jeans, a local farmer from Tranwell, near Morpeth, is also a county councillor and acting group leader for the Conservatives. But if the local elections are held, he won't be able to campaign because he is confined to home with a confirmed case of foot and mouth. He is to lose his 35 cattle and 250 sheep. He told me his animals had been infective for days and he wants action straight away.</p> <p>Tigger, our terrier, is obviously fed up with the constant news reports and has taken refuge in the coat cupboard next to the Aga. We have lost her several times over the past few days and I think she feels secure in there, away from the tensions affecting us all. We're going to move all the junk out later and put some old jerseys in there for her. The farm where she was born stands alongside a confirmed case, where John and Carol Brown are to lose their animals.</p> <p>Marmite, Tigger's litter sister, had her first puppies 11 days ago, but much to the children's chagrin we cannot visit them. Carol is very angry that she has not heard anything from Maff officially, but through the efforts of Peter Atkinson, they now know their animals will be taken. John hopes it will be soon - their flock is due to lamb in two weeks.</p> <p>For us, hopefully by Friday we will have too many lambs to count the number of sheep lambed. The routine of the season will take over. There is little more that we can do. We cannot control the weather - or the birds.

      "bodyText": "The signs of spring are now unmistakable, but we don't feel much like celebrating and our grass fields remain as bare as boards. Our first lamb arrived on Saturday, followed by another new calf, a red Limousin cross heifer, on Sunday night. The pied wagtails are back but, according to my diary, 13 days later than last year. They are such cheerful little birds, I cannot help smiling when I see them hopping about on the walls and in the sheds. The newest calf arrived at 10pm on Sunday and Peter thought all would be well, but as any farmer can tell you, animals are not always predictable. On Monday morning the calf had not suckled at all. Before breakfast we milked out the mother and fed the calf via a specially designed tube. This is not an easy task. This particular cow kicks like crazy when we milk her, but eventually Peter milked out 1.5 litres - enough to fill the small calf. Two days later, the calf has still not learned to feed herself, so we have to perform this task three times a day. However, the cow has settled slightly and lets us milk her. The prognosis for the calf is not good, but she is warm and fed regularly. There is not much more we can do. Eight sheep lambed on Monday. Our extra staff will arrive today, which will make a big difference. Ian's room is ready for him but we still have to clear the kitchen table of junk mail and a sewing machine in preparation for the constant meals and coffee breaks. I've just been for a quick haircut as I was beginning to resemble Dougal from the Magic Roundabout. It was a wet trim: no time (or money) for a tidy blow-dry. I also got my back straightened at the chiropractor's. Christophe says the strain is written all over our faces, and they can feel it in our spines, too. Peter has just talked to the vet, at the road end. We've been given some medicine for the sickly calf. I hope it helps. Three vets from the practice have now been seconded to Maff in Cumbria and the remaining few are carrying out emergencies only. They will not enter a farm unless absolutely necessary. There have been three new cases in Northumberland. The fear is mounting once again. Just as we get used to coping with the situation, the pressure increases. Maff insists its goal is to slaughter confirmed cases within 24 hours but in the past week in this region, the farmers have had to wait two to three days for a vet to come and a further two to three days for slaughter. We all feel this is unacceptable, and fear what happened in Cumbria will happen here. Our local MP, Peter Atkinson, the NFU and the vets are all pushing Maff as hard as they can. We have to keep up the pressure. There is too much at stake. Michael Jeans, a local farmer from Tranwell, near Morpeth, is also a county councillor and acting group leader for the Conservatives. But if the local elections are held, he won't be able to campaign because he is confined to home with a confirmed case of foot and mouth. He is to lose his 35 cattle and 250 sheep. He told me his animals had been infective for days and he wants action straight away. Tigger, our terrier, is obviously fed up with the constant news reports and has taken refuge in the coat cupboard next to the Aga. We have lost her several times over the past few days and I think she feels secure in there, away from the tensions affecting us all. We're going to move all the junk out later and put some old jerseys in there for her. The farm where she was born stands alongside a confirmed case, where John and Carol Brown are to lose their animals. Marmite, Tigger's litter sister, had her first puppies 11 days ago, but much to the children's chagrin we cannot visit them. Carol is very angry that she has not heard anything from Maff officially, but through the efforts of Peter Atkinson, they now know their animals will be taken. John hopes it will be soon - their flock is due to lamb in two weeks. For us, hopefully by Friday we will have too many lambs to count the number of sheep lambed. The routine of the season will take over. There is little more that we can do. We cannot control the weather - or the birds. Julie, our neighbour, rang me to say that thousands of blackheaded gulls have arrived at the reservoir that adjoins both our farms. We wonder why they have come and, more importantly, where they have come from. \u0095 The writer and her husband run a livestock farm near Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland.

Suspicious livestock began to be slaughtered in their hundreds. Such was the smoke from the incineration site in Northumberland that the A69 had to be closed for a time.

The last epidemic of FMD, in October 1967, led to the slaughter of 442,000 animals - a loss of hundreds of millions of pounds in today's terms, only a fraction of which made it back to the farmer in compensation. Last month's ban affected more than half of Britain's farmers and no one doubts that many will be ruined. </p> <p>The county of Devon seemed dark green and paranoid when I travelled there the day after the ban was introduced. Yet I'd planned my visit as an opportunity to gaze at a vision of farming success. Stapleton Farm, my destination, produces quality brands of yoghurt and ice-cream. It was the one named by the Sainsbury's executives, the day I walked with them around the flagship store on the Cromwell Road, as an example of the new kind of partnership that can exist between supermarkets and farmers. Their optimism seemed hard to recapture now. </p> <p>Passing through Bideford, Charles Kingsley's \"little white town\", you get a sudden rush of the way things used to be. Local records tell of how, in the 18th century, a bell would ring in Bideford market at 1pm, calling the local people to buy wheat. Traders were not allowed to buy until after 2pm, to prevent dealers overcharging the poor. The New Market, which opened in September 1960, sold 2,317 animals on its first day - dairy cows, calves, sheep and pigs. </p> <p>According to a correspondent in Devon Life, Bideford livestock market has weathered several outbreaks of foot and mouth disease. Peter Kivell, a local farmer, remembers the call in the small hours in October 1967, announcing the first case in the area: \"I spent the rest of the night wondering how we'd manage.\" </p> <p>The low green valleys of the West Country have been subject to far less of the subsidy-mad prairie-isation you see in other counties, yet still there has been a vast downsizing of the rural economy. In 1995, 78,402 animals were sold in Bideford market; in 1998, 48,826. Many farmers now run their farms at subsistence level. </p> <p>Stapleton Farm is not far from Bideford, nearer Great Torrington, and there isn't a cow to be seen. No livestock, no fields, no manure, no tractors, just a small manufacturing unit that couldn't be doing better. This is the enterprise Sainsbury's put me on to when I asked about the partnerships with farming that mattered to them. This is the new thing. </p> <p>I found Carol Duncan in a Portakabin she uses as an office. She was surrounded by Sainsbury's invoices and office stationery. Like her husband Peter, she considers herself a modern rural producer. \"I was delighted when we managed to get rid of the very last cow off this farm,\" she said. \"That's the thing about cows, you know, they just poo all the time.\" </p> <p>Peter's father and grandfather had run the farm in the traditional West Country way; they had livestock and worked the fields through thick and thin. \"But from an early age I wasn't interested in that kind of farming,\" Peter said. \"I wanted to be inside reading books. And I was interested in the different things you can do with milk. In the 1960s we farmers needed to diversify. The traditional way had been to stand around waiting for the government price review. I wanted to change things. My father would say: 'Who's going to milk the cows?' </p> <p>\"We started with three churns. Carol was an art teacher and that kept us going through the difficult years. We made yoghurt and started selling it to independent schools - if you're paying \u00a316,000 a year for a school, you want to make sure your children aren't eating rubbish.\" </p> <p>\"We had to fight for our markets,\" Carol said. \"In 1994 the price of milk in Devon went up by 29%. We had to increase the price of the yoghurt by 5% and we lost some of our German contracts. I went out and fought to get them back. It was horrible: 200-year-old cheesemakers were shut down and hardly a Devon clotted cream-maker was left standing. We thought we were going out of business.\" </p> <p>\"We started exporting our stuff,\" Peter said, \"to Belgium especially. We supply an upmarket supermarket chain called Delhaize.\" </p> <p>\"Until this morning,\" Carol interjected. \"We've just been banned from exporting.\" </p> <p>\"We're hoping it will only be a matter of weeks,\" Peter said, \"but this sort of thing can ruin people. We're praying it doesn't spread.\" </p> <p>The Duncans have more than 30 people working at Stapleton - chopping, grating, mixing, packaging, labelling, loading. The old farm buildings where the yoghurt and ice-cream are produced look typical enough among the high hedges of north Devon, yet inside each shed are silver machines and refrigerated rooms that are miles away from the world of cows. </p> <p>Peter tells the story of the Sainsbury's development manager coming down to see them in 1998 as if relating a great oral ballad about a local battle or love affair. \"The woman came down. I thought she seemed so fierce. They had already taken samples of our yoghurt away. They said they liked them. But when the woman came that day she just said: 'I suppose you'd like to see these' and it was the artwork for the pots. They'd already decided we were going into business. I nearly fell off my chair.\" </p> <p>Carol laughed. \"Yeah, and they said, how many of these could we produce a week?\" They started aiming for 10,000 pots a week in a hundred stores. \"It was incredibly hard work,\" Peter said. \"We were putting yoghurt into pots by hand and pressing the lids on. Then they wanted more. We had to get better machinery. So it was off to the bank for \u00a380,000. Come February 1999, we were doing 50,000-60,000 pots a week.\" </p> <p>\"We think Sainsbury's are geniuses,\" Carol added. \"We give them yoghurt and they sell it.\" </p> <p>Stapleton Farm processes all its own fruit by hand; the milk comes from three local farms. Recently, they started giving the milk farmers half a penny more per litre, because of the hard time the farmers are having. \"It's been a music hall joke for years,\" Peter said, \"about farmers complaining. But now the worst has come true.\" </p> <p>\"The ladies who work for us are all here to earn money to feed their kids,\" Carol said. \"The farms they live on are struggling. It's a struggle for us, too, but it's our little dream.\" </p> <p>The Duncans' dream has been one of survival and self-sufficiency, and being free of that last cow. But as environmentalists, they may have trouble living with the price of their own success: expansion. Supermarkets want to be able to rely on volume and if Stapleton Farm's yoghurt continues to grow in popularity, it will have to get bigger; the charm of its smallness cannot last. The week I met the Duncans, they were reeling from having bought a \u00a368,000 machine that wasn't yet working. Doing well entails spending more, so demand can be met. They are heavily in debt but also rejoicing in their success. </p> <p>\"Starting to do business with Sainsbury's feels like being mown down by a bus,\" Peter said. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" Carol said, \"but I was so relieved when we got rid of that last cow and that old farm. That's the thing with a lot of the farmers around here: they have the potential to get into tourism, get into the farm cottages side, caravans and all that. Farmers just have the wrong attitude.\" </p> <p>\"No,\" Peter said, \"not all of them. The problem was the Marketing Boards, which gave farmers the wrong idea. They thought someone would just take their produce away and turn it into money. No other country in Europe was like that. That is why we are so far behind.\" </p> <p>Carol heaved a sigh. \"I'm so pissed off about the foot and mouth disease. We had a whole lot of ice-cream going into Spain next week. Not now. I hope it doesn't spread to here.\" </p> <p>I asked the Duncans if they were worried about having all their eggs in one basket. What if people get fed up with Devon yoghurt? What if Sainsbury's find somewhere cheaper, or better able to meet the volume required? Or if it falls for the new kid on the block? Carol met my gaze evenly. \"We'll survive,\" she said. </p> <p>In the factory, Peter stopped in the middle of a chilled room, with the sound of clicking going on further along the line, the sound of mass production. \"This was a cattleshed when I was little,\" he said. \"I remember it clearly.\" </p> <p>We stood beside a pallet of strawberry yoghurts bound for Sainsbury's. It had the special label attached. I asked who paid for the Sainsbury's packaging. \"Oh, we do,\" he said. </p> <p>That afternoon Tim Yeo, the shadow agriculture spokesman, said the government had responded in chaotic fashion to a chain of farming crises. \"I wish he would shut up,\" Nick Brown replied. \"He is trying to make political capital out of a terrible situation.\" And when I was barely out of the West Country, news broke of another farm where livestock was found to have contracted foot and mouth. The farm was in Devon. And the farmer owned 13 other farms. </p> <p>\u00a9 Andrew O'Hagan. This is an edited version of an article that first appeared in the London Review of Books.

Like her husband Peter, she considers herself a modern rural producer. \"I was delighted when we managed to get rid of the very last cow off this farm,\" she said. \"That's the thing about cows, you know, they just poo all the time.\" Peter's father and grandfather had run the farm in the traditional West Country way; they had livestock and worked the fields through thick and thin. \"But from an early age I wasn't interested in that kind of farming,\" Peter said. \"I wanted to be inside reading books. And I was interested in the different things you can do with milk. In the 1960s we farmers needed to diversify. The traditional way had been to stand around waiting for the government price review. I wanted to change things. My father would say: 'Who's going to milk the cows?' \"We started with three churns. Carol was an art teacher and that kept us going through the difficult years. We made yoghurt and started selling it to independent schools - if you're paying \u00a316,000 a year for a school, you want to make sure your children aren't eating rubbish.\" \"We had to fight for our markets,\" Carol said. \"In 1994 the price of milk in Devon went up by 29%. We had to increase the price of the yoghurt by 5% and we lost some of our German contracts. I went out and fought to get them back. It was horrible: 200-year-old cheesemakers were shut down and hardly a Devon clotted cream-maker was left standing. We thought we were going out of business.\" \"We started exporting our stuff,\" Peter said, \"to Belgium especially. We supply an upmarket supermarket chain called Delhaize.\" \"Until this morning,\" Carol interjected. \"We've just been banned from exporting.\" \"We're hoping it will only be a matter of weeks,\" Peter said, \"but this sort of thing can ruin people. We're praying it doesn't spread.\" The Duncans have more than 30 people working at Stapleton - chopping, grating, mixing, packaging, labelling, loading. The old farm buildings where the yoghurt and ice-cream are produced look typical enough among the high hedges of north Devon, yet inside each shed are silver machines and refrigerated rooms that are miles away from the world of cows. Peter tells the story of the Sainsbury's development manager coming down to see them in 1998 as if relating a great oral ballad about a local battle or love affair. \"The woman came down. I thought she seemed so fierce. They had already taken samples of our yoghurt away. They said they liked them. But when the woman came that day she just said: 'I suppose you'd like to see these' and it was the artwork for the pots. They'd already decided we were going into business. I nearly fell off my chair.\" Carol laughed. \"Yeah, and they said, how many of these could we produce a week?\" They started aiming for 10,000 pots a week in a hundred stores. \"It was incredibly hard work,\" Peter said. \"We were putting yoghurt into pots by hand and pressing the lids on. Then they wanted more. We had to get better machinery. So it was off to the bank for \u00a380,000. Come February 1999, we were doing 50,000-60,000 pots a week.\" \"We think Sainsbury's are geniuses,\" Carol added. \"We give them yoghurt and they sell it.\" Stapleton Farm processes all its own fruit by hand; the milk comes from three local farms. Recently, they started giving the milk farmers half a penny more per litre, because of the hard time the farmers are having. \"It's been a music hall joke for years,\" Peter said, \"about farmers complaining. But now the worst has come true.\" \"The ladies who work for us are all here to earn money to feed their kids,\" Carol said. \"The farms they live on are struggling. It's a struggle for us, too, but it's our little dream.\" The Duncans' dream has been one of survival and self-sufficiency, and being free of that last cow. But as environmentalists, they may have trouble living with the price of their own success: expansion. Supermarkets want to be able to rely on volume and if Stapleton Farm's yoghurt continues to grow in popularity, it will have to get bigger; the charm of its smallness cannot last. The week I met the Duncans, they were reeling from having bought a \u00a368,000 machine that wasn't yet working. Doing well entails spending more, so demand can be met. They are heavily in debt but also rejoicing in their success. \"Starting to do business with Sainsbury's feels like being mown down by a bus,\" Peter said. \"Yes,\" Carol said, \"but I was so relieved when we got rid of that last cow and that old farm. That's the thing with a lot of the farmers around here: they have the potential to get into tourism, get into the farm cottages side, caravans and all that. Farmers just have the wrong attitude.\" \"No,\" Peter said, \"not all of them. The problem was the Marketing Boards, which gave farmers the wrong idea. They thought someone would just take their produce away and turn it into money. No other country in Europe was like that. That is why we are so far behind.\" Carol heaved a sigh. \"I'm so pissed off about the foot and mouth disease. We had a whole lot of ice-cream going into Spain next week. Not now. I hope it doesn't spread to here.\" I asked the Duncans if they were worried about having all their eggs in one basket. What if people get fed up with Devon yoghurt? What if Sainsbury's find somewhere cheaper, or better able to meet the volume required? Or if it falls for the new kid on the block? Carol met my gaze evenly. \"We'll survive,\" she said. In the factory, Peter stopped in the middle of a chilled room, with the sound of clicking going on further along the line, the sound of mass production. \"This was a cattleshed when I was little,\" he said. \"I remember it clearly.\" We stood beside a pallet of strawberry yoghurts bound for Sainsbury's. It had the special label attached. I asked who paid for the Sainsbury's packaging. \"Oh, we do,\" he said. That afternoon Tim Yeo, the shadow agriculture spokesman, said the government had responded in chaotic fashion to a chain of farming crises. \"I wish he would shut up,\" Nick Brown replied. \"He is trying to make political capital out of a terrible situation.\" And when I was barely out of the West Country, news broke of another farm where livestock was found to have contracted foot and mouth. The farm was in Devon. And the farmer owned 13 other farms. \u00a9 Andrew O'Hagan. This is an edited version of an article that first appeared in the London Review of Books.

      "body": "<p>Thousands of consignments of illegal meat arrive in Britain, travelling in either containers or hand luggage mainly from Africa and Asia - continents with recent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease.</p> <p>Bush rats, antelope, cow's nostrils, monkey meat, elephant, oriental sausages, even dried caterpillars and smoked grubs - as well as other unknown varieties of dried and smoked meat - are smuggled in for speciality ethnic markets.</p> <p>Larger consignments of pork, lamb, beef and goat from Asia and Africa are also stopped, since they could not pass EU regulations because they come from foot and mouth-infected countries or do not reach hygiene standards. Seizures run at 200 a month, but yesterday public health officials said they needed more powers to search baggage.</p> <p>Ports and airports throughout the UK have specialist officers looking for illegal meat. The practice is so common that baggage handlers at Heathrow regularly alert customs when they notice blood dripping out of suitcases, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.</p> <p>Yesterday in a Commons statement, Nick Brown, the minister of agriculture, said illegal meat was the probable cause of the outbreak of foot and mouth, but he refused to give details because of potential prosecution. The problem for investigators is that one tiny piece of infected meat in pigswill that has not been properly treated is enough to trigger an epidemic.</p> <p>The Association of Port Health Authorities called yesterday for tighter controls on containers ostensibly importing fruit or vegetables but which can be used to smuggle meat. It also wanted the power to inspect hand baggage but the Ministry of Agriculture has so far refused, relying on customs officers to do the checks.</p> <p>At Gatwick airport, where public health officers have the right to inspect containers, 225 consignments were seized last year totalling 67 tonnes. The main sources were Ghana, Gambia, Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast. But according to Graham Forbes, principal environmental health officer for Crawley council, the countries involved at Gatwick reflected mainly where the airport's cargo flights came from; there were also seizures from Argentina where there is foot and mouth.</p> <p>\"A major extra source is passenger baggage, but we cannot inspect on our own - only if customs stop people and let us see in the suitcase. It is a loophole the association has been trying to close for years.\"</p> <p>Mr Forbes said that, to test whether meat was coming in illegally, he and other officers had visited a market in Hackney in east London, and had seen bushmeat on sale. It had come through Gatwick, but the numbers on the consignment showed it had arrived illegally.</p> <p>Doug Bloomfield, assistant director of environmental services for Suffolk coastal district council, responsible for Felixstowe, the biggest container port in Britain, said he seized on average one illegal consignment a week. \"It can be anything from a few sausages from Asia to 300 to 400 cartons hidden in a container load of something else. Sometimes we have to empty the whole consignment to find things, at other times there are large quantities.\"</p> <p>He said the the authorities rarely prosecuted because it was difficult to prove intent. The usual defence was that the meat was unsolicited. Very often consignments were mislabelled or not mentioned at all on the list of contents.</p> <p>The temptation to smuggle comes partly because \"welly meat\", as it is called, is popular with West Africans and can fetch good prices. EU regulations ban many meat products like pomos (cows nostrils) or smokies (blowtorched pieces of goat with the skin on) because of BSE. Both can be bought in markets although pomos are sold \"under the counter\".</p> <p>Larger consignments of pork, lamb and goat, destined for Chinese, Indian and other Asian restaurants come from meat plants and abattoirs without EU licenses.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of consignments of illegal meat arrive in Britain, travelling in either containers or hand luggage mainly from Africa and Asia - continents with recent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease. Bush rats, antelope, cow's nostrils, monkey meat, elephant, oriental sausages, even dried caterpillars and smoked grubs - as well as other unknown varieties of dried and smoked meat - are smuggled in for speciality ethnic markets. Larger consignments of pork, lamb, beef and goat from Asia and Africa are also stopped, since they could not pass EU regulations because they come from foot and mouth-infected countries or do not reach hygiene standards. Seizures run at 200 a month, but yesterday public health officials said they needed more powers to search baggage. Ports and airports throughout the UK have specialist officers looking for illegal meat. The practice is so common that baggage handlers at Heathrow regularly alert customs when they notice blood dripping out of suitcases, according to the Ministry of Agriculture. Yesterday in a Commons statement, Nick Brown, the minister of agriculture, said illegal meat was the probable cause of the outbreak of foot and mouth, but he refused to give details because of potential prosecution. The problem for investigators is that one tiny piece of infected meat in pigswill that has not been properly treated is enough to trigger an epidemic. The Association of Port Health Authorities called yesterday for tighter controls on containers ostensibly importing fruit or vegetables but which can be used to smuggle meat. It also wanted the power to inspect hand baggage but the Ministry of Agriculture has so far refused, relying on customs officers to do the checks. At Gatwick airport, where public health officers have the right to inspect containers, 225 consignments were seized last year totalling 67 tonnes. The main sources were Ghana, Gambia, Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast. But according to Graham Forbes, principal environmental health officer for Crawley council, the countries involved at Gatwick reflected mainly where the airport's cargo flights came from; there were also seizures from Argentina where there is foot and mouth. \"A major extra source is passenger baggage, but we cannot inspect on our own - only if customs stop people and let us see in the suitcase. It is a loophole the association has been trying to close for years.\" Mr Forbes said that, to test whether meat was coming in illegally, he and other officers had visited a market in Hackney in east London, and had seen bushmeat on sale. It had come through Gatwick, but the numbers on the consignment showed it had arrived illegally. Doug Bloomfield, assistant director of environmental services for Suffolk coastal district council, responsible for Felixstowe, the biggest container port in Britain, said he seized on average one illegal consignment a week. \"It can be anything from a few sausages from Asia to 300 to 400 cartons hidden in a container load of something else. Sometimes we have to empty the whole consignment to find things, at other times there are large quantities.\" He said the the authorities rarely prosecuted because it was difficult to prove intent. The usual defence was that the meat was unsolicited. Very often consignments were mislabelled or not mentioned at all on the list of contents. The temptation to smuggle comes partly because \"welly meat\", as it is called, is popular with West Africans and can fetch good prices. EU regulations ban many meat products like pomos (cows nostrils) or smokies (blowtorched pieces of goat with the skin on) because of BSE. Both can be bought in markets although pomos are sold \"under the counter\". Larger consignments of pork, lamb and goat, destined for Chinese, Indian and other Asian restaurants come from meat plants and abattoirs without EU licenses. Plants importing meat have to be inspected and approved by the EU and certified as foot and mouth-free. Each legal consignment has a distinctive number so its origin can be traced. This is costly to the supplier. Even if applications for licences were made, many would fail to meet regulations because foot and mouth in Asia, particularly China, and southern Africa make imports illegal in any event. Pete Rotheram, secretary of the Association of Port Health Authorities, said more resources were needed. \"It is very easy to make illegal shipments, and there is a good chance that they can evade all controls,\" he said. The agriculture ministry said it often alerted customs after tip-offs from legal importers losing trade. Last year all flights from Ghana were searched after a complaint from dried fish importers; several tonnes of illegal fish in hand luggage were seized, but this led to a complaint of racial harassment against the ministry.

Among those arrested were Uros Suvakovic, a former department head of Serbia's state security and lieutenant of Mr Milosevic's wife Mirjana Markovic, and the former deputy chief of the secretpolice, Nikola Curcic, the Belgrade district court confirmed. The arrests bring to about 15 the number of former associates in custody. Most prominent is Rade Markovic, head of the secret police for the last three years of the Milosevic regime. He was arrested a month ago, on suspicion of ordering an assassination attempt on the opposition leader Vuk Draskovic in October 1999. Four of Mr Draskovic's party colleagues died in the attack. Mr Markovic denies the charges. Mr Curcic was arrested on Saturday, the rest on Monday. The Belgrade court said Mr Curcic was put under 30-day detention on suspicion of revealing state secrets. Mr Suvakovic, Danilo Pantovic, a former senior foreign and interior ministry official, and Milos Loncar, another federal government official, are being investigated in connection with the purchase of the villa where Mr Milosevic lives. Four more officials are suspected of embezzling about \u00a3350,000 from Serbia's health insurance funds.",

Who wins when the same city shudders from a second blast just a few hours later?</p> <p>Certainly not the Israelis, on the receiving end of that treatment yesterday. Not the family of Shalhavet Pass, who have lost a baby daughter. They may have chosen to live on the West Bank, in Hebron, a tiny enclave of 400 Jewish settlers surrounded by 120,000 Palestinians, but their daughter made no choice. As one Palestinian activist put it yesterday, she \"was a baby who didn't even know she was a settler\".</p> <p>So the Pass family are not winners. Nor are the citizens of Israel proper - those who have avoided the risks taken by the 400 hardliners of Hebron. They do not live in the heart of occupied territory; they are not driven by ideology. Yet they, too, feel nervous wherever they walk: yesterday's car bomb was left outside a Jerusalem supermarket. Nowhere is safe. In today's Israel a simple bus ride is a gamble with fate. Passengers eye each other cautiously: what if that man, over there, has dynamite strapped to his chest and is about to blow?</p> <p>So the Israelis are not winning. But are the Palestinians? The sniper who killed Shalhavet: did he gain something for his people or his cause? If so, what exactly? Six months to the day since this intifada began, it's time to ask: what good is coming from it? What is it for?</p> <p>Palestinians themselves are beginning to ask that question. For they are the ones paying for the uprising which erupted last September - paying for it in their blood, their children and their livelihoods.</p> <p>Just look at the death toll: more than 420 lives have been lost, but the overwhelming majority of them, 350, have been Palestinian - dozens of them kids. They have seen a 12-year-old boy, Muhammad al-Durrah, shot dead in his father's arms (just like Shalhavet). Each week another Palestinian infant is transformed into a \"martyr\".</p> <p>Palestinian lives are made next to impossible. Every attack on Israel brings another clampdown: either the closure of the West Bank and Gaza, choking off economic life in the territories, or \"internal closures\", cutting off movement between Palestine's cities, towns and villages. The result, says the United Nations, is a Palestinian economy losing $11m a day.</p> <p>But the biggest problem comes from the Israeli response to Palestinian gun attacks. TV audiences around the world probably believe this intifada is like the last one, back in the late 1980s: a battle of an armed Israeli Goliath against hundreds of young, stone-throwing Palestinian Davids. The current uprising certainly began that way - but it's changed.</p> <p>Now it is fought less by a mass movement than by an activist minority - using guns. The crack troops are the tanzim, Palestinian fighters who enjoy a half in, half out relationship with Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. It is the tanzim who fire on Jewish settlements and on Israeli army positions. Theirs is a time-honoured, anti-colonial strategy - a guerrilla war designed to make the occupiers' lives so unbearable they eventually have no choice but to leave.</p> <p>The problem is that, in the process, the tanzim are ruining the lives of their own people. For these fighters tend to use residential Palestinian neighbourhoods as their base, firing from building sites or hollowed-out ruins. The Israelis then hit back at the source of the fire, sending local people cowering into basements and back rooms to avoid getting hurt. The result is a surge in casualties among Palestinian families who are shooting no bullets - but live too close to those who do. The killing of baby Shalhavet is a case in point: Israelis immediately hit back, with machine-gun fire and shells, wounding 16 Palestinians including a three-year-old boy. That Arab toddler did not kill the Jewish baby, but he paid the price all the same.</p> <p>Now a backlash is underway. As Suzanne Goldenberg reports today, a range of Palestinians, from the grassroots to the elite, is beginning to rebel against the gunmen who are drawing the Israelis' fire. \"We don't want to be accused of opposing the intifada,\" Ahmed Orabi, a Palestinian resident of Al Bireh told the New York Times. \"But there is no rationale for what these thugs are doing. Their actions are risking the safety of the whole neighbourhood.\"</p> <p>And before you write Mr Orabi off as some unrepresentative moderate, note that the de facto commander of the uprising, Marwan Barghouti, has also condemned shootings from populated areas - while Hamas says the tanzim are driving Palestinians out of their own neighbourhoods. On a Palestinian radio talk show last month, one speaker warned that unless Arafat brought the young gunmen into line, West Bank residents would not only abandon their villages - they would emigrate altogether.</p> <p>Besides this most practical cost, the intifada is hurting the Palestinians politically. Israeli public opinion, which was beginning to gird itself for enormous concessions to the Palestinians, hardens every day. Every attack on a Jewish civilian, every car bomb, makes an Israeli consensus to give up land, or to divide Jerusalem, more remote.</p> <p>All this is prompting some serious second thoughts among Palestinian circles. Journalist Daoud Kuttab's website asks, \"Where is all this leading to? Shouldn't we have accepted the Clinton ideas? Where does the return to 70s and 80s rhetoric get us? Are we entering into a dark tunnel without an end in sight?\"</p> <p>Some suggest changing the intifada into a non-violent, Gandhi-style rebellion, perhaps blasting Jewish settlements with Palestinian music or prayers for 24 hours a day - that would soon drive them away, says one activist. Others want to look again at that Clinton-brokered offer, rejected by Arafat last year.</p> <p>Admittedly, that Camp David plan had deep flaws. The map of the putative Palestine was a swiss cheese, full of holes; and Israel did not accept that 3.7m Palestinian refugees should have the right to return, a move most Israelis believe would amount to national suicide. But the basis of a deal was there, especially in the beefed-up form on offer in January: the Palestinians could've built on it. It would have paved the way for statehood and a share of Jerusalem, including Palestinian control over the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif.</p> <p>So no wonder many Palestinians are looking back wistfully at that offer now. The naive among them think they can still have it, by restarting talks with Ariel Sharon and picking up where they left off. But Sharon is not the same as his predecessor, Ehud Barak: that deal is not on the table. And, with Bill Clinton gone, the Palestinians no longer have a US president obsessed with middle east peace: when they ring Washington now, they'll be lucky to get their call returned.</p> <p>No, the Palestinian tragedy is to be locked into an uprising that is hurting them more than their enemy - guided by a leadership with a fateful talent for missing history's moment.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com&quot;\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>BMW's six-year experiment with moving into the volume car market via Rover continues to cause problems with history in Munich. For many insiders it is as if the period 1994-2000 never existed, airbrushed out of the official record along with Messrs Pischetsrieder and Reitzle, architects of a failed strategy that nearly drove BMW into the hands of VW, Ford or General Motors. </p> <p>Professor Joachim Milberg, the chairman who braved a political storm in the UK to exit Rover, is hailed as the new Von K\u00fchnheim, the German group's saviour. Yesterday Prof Milberg and his finance director, Helmut Panke, drew a historic line under the Rover experience. No, Milberg said, BMW would not \"delete the Rover lesson\" as it was part of its overall development - back to Von K\u00fchnheim's strategy of eschewing mass production for premium output. With Rover, BMW had tried to do both but the British brand was \"too weak\" to succeed. </p> <p>Putting aside the fact that Milberg was saying the opposite in Geneva, just a month before ditching Rover, and that the dual strategy was flawed from the start, BMW has indeed turned a fresh corner. Its independence guaranteed for now, the German group is producing more cars than ever; it is making excellent profits and even sees little downside in the current US slump. </p> <p>It is promising better sales and earnings this year. It is, Milberg claimed, \"the only multi-brand car manufacturer in the world not operating in the mass market\". </p> <p>Judging by the figures, though, the cost has been substantial. Even with a skillful jiggle of the balance-sheet and the \u20ac3bn sale of Land Rover to Ford, Panke has still managed to produce a net loss over six years of \u20ac4.1bn or \u00a32.7bn. But the accounts, even after the sale of Rover and of Land Rover, remain incomplete. BMW's \u00a3500m dowry to Phoenix is not fully paid, while repayment of that loan, in instalments over 50 years, is yet to begin. </p> <p>Then, BMW is still selling off the Longbridge engine plant and the Swindon body-pressing facility so the net cost may yet prove significantly less than Panke's figure yesterday. And, in a sense, BMW has got off scot-free: its reputation, especially in the UK, remains untarnished. It can embark on Milberg's \"uncompromising premium brand strategy\" - selling hundreds of thousands of cars designed and built to customers' specifications. It's worked well, in the past as well as now, and a US downturn is hardly likely to blow it off course. We are talking about a temporary blip - just like Rover. </p> <p><strong> Busy as a banker </strong><br> </p> <p> This newspaper's banking expert, Jill Treanor, is on holiday this week - holiday that had been held over from last year, since Treanor was too busy covering the Lloyds/Abbey bid to take time off. It had been the same the year before, what with Bank of Scotland trying to take over NatWest, only to be pipped by Royal Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>That is two years lunching middle-aged men, taking late night calls from desperate bankers and fretting about the competition. But that is life. Sometimes it is very busy. </p> <p>Yet in the world inhabited by Sir George Mathewson, deputy chairman of Royal Bank, hard work is a special thing, requiring extraordinary awards.

      "bodyText": "BMW's six-year experiment with moving into the volume car market via Rover continues to cause problems with history in Munich. For many insiders it is as if the period 1994-2000 never existed, airbrushed out of the official record along with Messrs Pischetsrieder and Reitzle, architects of a failed strategy that nearly drove BMW into the hands of VW, Ford or General Motors. Professor Joachim Milberg, the chairman who braved a political storm in the UK to exit Rover, is hailed as the new Von K\u00fchnheim, the German group's saviour. Yesterday Prof Milberg and his finance director, Helmut Panke, drew a historic line under the Rover experience. No, Milberg said, BMW would not \"delete the Rover lesson\" as it was part of its overall development - back to Von K\u00fchnheim's strategy of eschewing mass production for premium output. With Rover, BMW had tried to do both but the British brand was \"too weak\" to succeed. Putting aside the fact that Milberg was saying the opposite in Geneva, just a month before ditching Rover, and that the dual strategy was flawed from the start, BMW has indeed turned a fresh corner. Its independence guaranteed for now, the German group is producing more cars than ever; it is making excellent profits and even sees little downside in the current US slump. It is promising better sales and earnings this year. It is, Milberg claimed, \"the only multi-brand car manufacturer in the world not operating in the mass market\". Judging by the figures, though, the cost has been substantial. Even with a skillful jiggle of the balance-sheet and the \u20ac3bn sale of Land Rover to Ford, Panke has still managed to produce a net loss over six years of \u20ac4.1bn or \u00a32.7bn. But the accounts, even after the sale of Rover and of Land Rover, remain incomplete. BMW's \u00a3500m dowry to Phoenix is not fully paid, while repayment of that loan, in instalments over 50 years, is yet to begin. Then, BMW is still selling off the Longbridge engine plant and the Swindon body-pressing facility so the net cost may yet prove significantly less than Panke's figure yesterday. And, in a sense, BMW has got off scot-free: its reputation, especially in the UK, remains untarnished. It can embark on Milberg's \"uncompromising premium brand strategy\" - selling hundreds of thousands of cars designed and built to customers' specifications. It's worked well, in the past as well as now, and a US downturn is hardly likely to blow it off course. We are talking about a temporary blip - just like Rover. Busy as a banker This newspaper's banking expert, Jill Treanor, is on holiday this week - holiday that had been held over from last year, since Treanor was too busy covering the Lloyds/Abbey bid to take time off. It had been the same the year before, what with Bank of Scotland trying to take over NatWest, only to be pipped by Royal Bank of Scotland. That is two years lunching middle-aged men, taking late night calls from desperate bankers and fretting about the competition. But that is life. Sometimes it is very busy. Yet in the world inhabited by Sir George Mathewson, deputy chairman of Royal Bank, hard work is a special thing, requiring extraordinary awards. It is considered entirely justified that he and his colleagues should trouser bonuses worth \u00a32.5m simply because the bank succeeded in taking over NatWest. The award is not linked to the merits of the takeover, which has yet to prove its worth in terms of sustained shareholder value, and so the National Association of Pension Funds is now recommending that as punishment its institutional shareholder members vote against the re-election of two Royal Bank non-executive directors (Sir Iain Vallance and Sir Angus Grossart). Sir George's response? Well, according to yesterday's Financial Times, the matter \"frankly, was not worthwhile talking to shareholders about.\" And the size of the bonus \"wouldn't have given you bragging power in a Soho wine bar.\" In any case, \"we had a team who gave eight months of their life.\" These are crass and insensitive statements, guaranteed to repulse customers and alienate Royal Bank's lower-paid staff. Sir George seems to have forgotten what his job is. He is not paid to be a corporate financier, landing a bonus every time he rings the big bell; he is charged with running a bank for the benefit of its shareholders. He and his colleagues should apologise and transfer the award into a long-term, performance-led incentive scheme. As for bragging in a Soho wine bar, our diarist, Richard Adams, has been dispatched to check the verity of the statement but had yet to return to the office last night.",

This week, he is on a three-day tour of seven European cities to promote NetJet, the corporate aircraft firm which his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, bought for $725m (\u00a3500m) three years ago. </p> <p>NetJet is one of the leaders in a rapidly growing market for executive jets. In the US, most top business people, sports stars and entertainers feel they need their own transport. Aircraft are still frowned upon in corporate Britain, as the engineering company Tomkins will bear witness, but Mr Buffett reckons they will soon take off on this side of the Atlantic: \"I can't conceive of a Europe without thousands of owners 10 years from now.\" </p> <p><strong> Aunt Katie's share</strong><br> </p> <p> NetJet, which has a fleet of 338 aircraft, has snapped up 40% of all the new corporate jets built over the past four years, largely because it offers \"fractional ownership\" - a kind of timeshare deal on private aircraft. Customers buy an eighth or a 16th of a jet, entitling them to a certain number of flying hours. </p> <p>Fractional ownership appealed to Mr Buffett as soon as he encountered it. \"I literally hadn't heard of it until six or seven years ago. </p> <p>\"Now both my sisters are in it and my kids are in it - although they've got very small shares.\" </p> <p>Even Mr Buffett's 94-year-old Aunt Katie has a slice of ownership of a NetJet corporate jet. Other fans included Pete Sampras, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Martina Hingis, as well as companies such as General Electric, Gillette and Texaco. Timeshare on aircraft is becoming ever more popular as companies dispose of their own fleets because of uncertain economic conditions. </p> <p>So sure is NetJet of the potential of its proposition that it is investing $400m in 50 new mid-range Citation aircraft. With 2,400 \"owners\" on its books worldwide, Netjet had aircraft allocated to 92 countries last year. </p> <p>Mr Buffett reckons selling corporate planes is as promising in business terms as Coca-Cola. \"Production of Coke started in Atlanta in 1884 and now it is in 200 countries, with 1.1bn servings sold per day. NetJet's somewhere on that scale, between 1bn and 1.1bn a day.\" </p> <p><strong> 'Admiral's barge'</strong><br> </p> <p> There are at present about 2,000 corporate jets in operation across Europe, although companies are shy of discussing the subject, fearing that will provoke the assumption that the aircraft are used for frivolous trips. Turkey farmer Bernard Matthews' ownership of two aircraft has raised eyebrows, but the aviation industry insists that management abuse is rare. </p> <p>Graham Forbes, chief executive of the General Aviation Manufacturers and Traders Association, says: \"The concept of the admiral's barge is dead. The idea that a chief executive would have a jet for his own use is pretty much gone.\" </p> <p>He says corporate planes can actually make life tougher for employees, because companies allow them less travelling time: \"I've heard of people being expected to go to South Africa and back in one day. The companies take the view that once you get on a private aircraft, it's just another office - it's working time.\" </p> <p>One of the few British companies that is open about its aircraft ownership is BP, which says it has \"a couple\" of aircraft which it accidentally inherited when it bought the US group Amoco. </p> <p>\"With the acquisition of Amoco, we have a number of sites which are difficult to connect to each other, so we have kept a couple of their planes,\" a spokesman says. </p> <p>One of BP's aircraft was damaged last year when it skidded off a runway in Cape Cod, careered across a four-lane highway and crashed into a wall. It was carrying the group's deputy chief executive, Rodney Chase, who was shaken but unhurt. </p> <p>Brian Humphries, who runs Shell's fleet of corporate jets, says executives have to make a strong case for use of one of the oil company's aircraft. They are largely used for particularly tight schedules or for trips to places which are not accessible by commercial flights: \"Shell has had corporate aircraft since 1927. We use them a lot now for going to places in the former Soviet Union.\" </p> <p>Mr Humphries, who is also head of the European Business Aviation Association, says \"break even\" for a corporate aircraft usually occurs with four passengers on board; that number makes a private plane as cheap as business class commercial fares. </p> <p>For pop stars and sports people the advantages of a small aircraft are privacy and security. There is also personal service: Tiger Woods likes a supply of Big Macs available to him when he flies with NetJet. </p> <p>For companies, the issue is flexibility. Mr Forbes says: \"Just imagine you've got to take a sales team to a particular place. If you're travelling on a scheduled flight, you've got a limited range of destinations - you may well have to change somewhere. </p> <p>\"On a scheduled flight, a great deal of time is taken up going through terminals. If you regard your sales team as a cost, it's better for them to waste less time and get on a smaller plane.\" </p> <p><strong> Stock market indicator</strong><br> </p> <p> The aviation industry points out that in the US planes are considered no more unusual as business assets than computers and shredders. In Britain attitudes are beginning to soften. Even the government is beginning to take a different view. A report by the Department of Transport three years ago concluded that good access for business aircraft was one of the three most important factors in encouraging inward investments to a region, and airports such as Manchester and London City have been encouraged to open up to corporate customers. </p> <p>NetJet's total revenue was $1.8bn last year. The company does not disclose its profits but for Mr Buffett the company has advantages other than financial returns. The billionaire financier jokes that the company acts as a great stock market indicator: \"If any company cancels a plane and I find out about it early, I know it's a good stock to short [sell].\"</p>",

Aircraft are still frowned upon in corporate Britain, as the engineering company Tomkins will bear witness, but Mr Buffett reckons they will soon take off on this side of the Atlantic: \"I can't conceive of a Europe without thousands of owners 10 years from now.\" Aunt Katie's share NetJet, which has a fleet of 338 aircraft, has snapped up 40% of all the new corporate jets built over the past four years, largely because it offers \"fractional ownership\" - a kind of timeshare deal on private aircraft. Customers buy an eighth or a 16th of a jet, entitling them to a certain number of flying hours. Fractional ownership appealed to Mr Buffett as soon as he encountered it. \"I literally hadn't heard of it until six or seven years ago. \"Now both my sisters are in it and my kids are in it - although they've got very small shares.\" Even Mr Buffett's 94-year-old Aunt Katie has a slice of ownership of a NetJet corporate jet. Other fans included Pete Sampras, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Martina Hingis, as well as companies such as General Electric, Gillette and Texaco. Timeshare on aircraft is becoming ever more popular as companies dispose of their own fleets because of uncertain economic conditions. So sure is NetJet of the potential of its proposition that it is investing $400m in 50 new mid-range Citation aircraft. With 2,400 \"owners\" on its books worldwide, Netjet had aircraft allocated to 92 countries last year. Mr Buffett reckons selling corporate planes is as promising in business terms as Coca-Cola. \"Production of Coke started in Atlanta in 1884 and now it is in 200 countries, with 1.1bn servings sold per day. NetJet's somewhere on that scale, between 1bn and 1.1bn a day.\" 'Admiral's barge' There are at present about 2,000 corporate jets in operation across Europe, although companies are shy of discussing the subject, fearing that will provoke the assumption that the aircraft are used for frivolous trips. Turkey farmer Bernard Matthews' ownership of two aircraft has raised eyebrows, but the aviation industry insists that management abuse is rare. Graham Forbes, chief executive of the General Aviation Manufacturers and Traders Association, says: \"The concept of the admiral's barge is dead. The idea that a chief executive would have a jet for his own use is pretty much gone.\" He says corporate planes can actually make life tougher for employees, because companies allow them less travelling time: \"I've heard of people being expected to go to South Africa and back in one day. The companies take the view that once you get on a private aircraft, it's just another office - it's working time.\" One of the few British companies that is open about its aircraft ownership is BP, which says it has \"a couple\" of aircraft which it accidentally inherited when it bought the US group Amoco. \"With the acquisition of Amoco, we have a number of sites which are difficult to connect to each other, so we have kept a couple of their planes,\" a spokesman says. One of BP's aircraft was damaged last year when it skidded off a runway in Cape Cod, careered across a four-lane highway and crashed into a wall. It was carrying the group's deputy chief executive, Rodney Chase, who was shaken but unhurt. Brian Humphries, who runs Shell's fleet of corporate jets, says executives have to make a strong case for use of one of the oil company's aircraft. They are largely used for particularly tight schedules or for trips to places which are not accessible by commercial flights: \"Shell has had corporate aircraft since 1927. We use them a lot now for going to places in the former Soviet Union.\" Mr Humphries, who is also head of the European Business Aviation Association, says \"break even\" for a corporate aircraft usually occurs with four passengers on board; that number makes a private plane as cheap as business class commercial fares. For pop stars and sports people the advantages of a small aircraft are privacy and security. There is also personal service: Tiger Woods likes a supply of Big Macs available to him when he flies with NetJet. For companies, the issue is flexibility. Mr Forbes says: \"Just imagine you've got to take a sales team to a particular place. If you're travelling on a scheduled flight, you've got a limited range of destinations - you may well have to change somewhere. \"On a scheduled flight, a great deal of time is taken up going through terminals. If you regard your sales team as a cost, it's better for them to waste less time and get on a smaller plane.\" Stock market indicator The aviation industry points out that in the US planes are considered no more unusual as business assets than computers and shredders. In Britain attitudes are beginning to soften. Even the government is beginning to take a different view. A report by the Department of Transport three years ago concluded that good access for business aircraft was one of the three most important factors in encouraging inward investments to a region, and airports such as Manchester and London City have been encouraged to open up to corporate customers. NetJet's total revenue was $1.8bn last year. The company does not disclose its profits but for Mr Buffett the company has advantages other than financial returns. The billionaire financier jokes that the company acts as a great stock market indicator: \"If any company cancels a plane and I find out about it early, I know it's a good stock to short [sell].\"",

It was the sound of a broken man, befuddled by moonshine, playing a smashed instrument with work-worn stumps. There are no lyrics, only terrible guttural moans from a man born just too late to have known slavery. </p> <p>This is one of the most remarkable tracks on Back To Black: 100 years of Black Music, a 10-CD, 220-track journey from ragtime to UK garage, masterminded by 1980s hip-hop impresario Morgan Khan. The journey really ends on the penultimate track, Goldie's stark, haunting Inner City Life. Decades apart, on different continents, Johnson and Goldie give voice to the same nervous, ravaged life experience. </p> <p>\"The struggle\" informs much of this amazing boxed set, and the pining, searching tone is consistent, whether applied to harsh life or cruel love. It's the mode of delivery that changes and dazzles. From ragtime through swing, blues and jazz to rock and soul, disco and rap, the turbulent story is marked by incredible music. </p> <p>Of course, \"black music\" means \"African-American music\". And by that Khan and his 35-strong selection panel mean modern music. Nine of the CDs cover the postwar era, when radio and the music industry proper took off. Its underpinnings - slave song and gospel - are mostly assumed. Even so, boxed sets usually collect works of an artist or label and this is a plucky attempt at an objective historical overview. </p> <p>Early on, the clumsily named vaudevillian acts such as Bessie Smith with Buck &amp; His Band predominate. And yet Smith's 1933 Gimme a Pigfoot resonates down the years. With her rasping lament, \"Give me a pigfoot and a beer 'cos baby I don't care!\", you feel it's only the choice of snackfood that separates her from the \"girl power\" generation. </p> <p>But the black music century gathers pace as aspirations rise and music biz infrastructure, such as radio and labels, arrives. By the time covered by the second CD - 1946 to 1953 - the groups are marketed under snazzier monikers: the Clovers, the Orioles, the Coasters. Listen to Clyde McPhatter's Money Honey and then flick forward to the Wu-Tang Clan's C.R.E.A.M. (Cash Rules Everything Around Me). The only difference is McPhatter's bluesy, fatalistic response to hard times. The Wu-Tang Clan exercise an altogether tighter fiscal policy, reinforced with mastery of kung-fu. </p> <p>One part of the black music story is of cowed, duped minstrels evolving into the \"gettin' paid\" entrepreneurs of rap. If only the early black rock'n'rollers had been more hard-headed. By the time we reach a selection of the famous \"race records\" that inspired everyone from Elvis to the Beatles and the Stones, the scale of white debt to black R&amp;B is clear. The implication of including Big Mama Thornton's Hound Dog is obvious: Elvis was cruising to icon status on black talent. </p> <p>And yet, you could imagine a broader, more radical interpretation of what constitutes the black canon. Why not, for example, include Elvis's All Shook Up or Don't Be Cruel, the compositions of black musician Otis Blackwell? Are black, backroom contributions to be written out of history because they were interpreted by a white man? Why include Booker T and the MGs' Green Onions when the group was half white and the Stax label white-owned? Later in this collection the definition of black music will slide dramatically. </p> <p>Before that, though, we're in the era of \"classic soul\", and the period of civil rights, assassinations, the Vietnam draft (black men comprised more than 30% of front-line forces) passes in an embarrassment of love songs. Diana Ross and the Supremes, the Four Tops, the Temptations and Stevie Wonder all contribute to what writer Nelson George has called \"black gold, black oil\". But soul's social voices are missing: Sam Cooke, Gil Scott Heron and Curtis Mayfield. Cooke especially is an essential bridge between gospel and the emergence of soul. What's more, his epochal A Change is Gonna Come would have provided the essential soundtrack to the social tremors of the 1960s. But despite personal appeals from the compilers, his estate wouldn't play ball. </p> <p>By the time we reach the \"disco inferno\" CD, black music is no longer resonating with social concern or even sounding particularly underground. Sister Sledge, Donna Summer, Chic, Barry White and Rose Royce are familiar for a reason. Disco, black music's least militant and most escapist form, is where the white mainstream has always felt most comfortable. And yet these party tunes were a response to the Nixon/Ford-era recession in the black neighbourhoods. </p> <p>In the 1980s and 1990s, the next time things got tough in the ghetto, white folk would catch one line of the black soundtrack before gathering the family and leading them down into the cellar. And yet when we reach \"Black Pop &amp; Hip-Hop Culture\", it's all a bit ragged. Sadly, all music history is written by licensing lawyers and their willingness to release tracks. Here we have to make do with some ropey late LL Cool J (Phenomenon) and Public Enemy's Do You Wanna Go Our Way? The lawyers also explain the absence of Prince. </p> <p>More importantly, the rules of engagement have changed. So far this history has celebrated black music without troubling itself over the weak-ass, white pop it inspired. Then, suddenly, it's reclaimed and something to be celebrated. And who do we have taking their place in the pantheon of greats? Gabrielle! Eternal! You check the CD notes' claims about the \"powerful political and sociological subtext\" of the music, then try to find it in Billy Ocean's Caribbean Queen. Is this really one of the most important 220 recordings in the last century? \"I think there was almost a punch-up over that one,\" says Khan. \"But we felt we should honour what Ocean achieved as a global pop star.\" </p> <p>This raises an important question. Since so many black artists now \"cross over\", should we still be talking about a separate black music? And what about white artists making black music? Eminem might at first appear to be hip-hop's Elvis, the rock'n'roll whitewash replayed. And yet we can hardly claim he has toned down his act for white sensibilities. And with Dr Dre pulling the strings, we can hardly moan that the wrong guys are getting paid. He's black-owned. He's a black act. He's a trophy of black music's final victory, many years after Blind Willie Johnson sat on the porch thrashing his busted strings. </p> <p>\"It's the big debate,\" says Khan. \"I don't know if anyone will be able to do this in 100 years. With integration, with equality, maybe the black urban form is now the mainstream. The last 100 years were unusual, to say the least.

The great ones match brainpower with instinct: part of what they do is as mysterious to them as it is to us watching. </p> <p>Watching Sam West play Richard II for the Royal Shakespeare Company last year, you caught a glimpse of that. West's Richard was a man too bright and aware to be the kind of king he was born to be. His tragedy was to discover that divine right is a prison. Only in death does he finally behave like a king. West made you understand the tragedy of that journey. </p> <p>It was an astonishing performance, given that his previous Shakespearean experience amounted to playing Hal in Henry IV and Octavius in the National's derided Anthony and Cleopatra. His reward is now to get a crack at Hamlet, a man who you could say is too intelligent for his own good. </p> <p>As the son of Timothy West and Prunella Scales, Sam West has acting in his blood, yet he fears he may be too naturally analytical to be an actor. \"I have a talent; I don't think that I have a gift for it,\" he says. \"Those that have a real gift are often unashamedly subjective in their approach. They are not interested in talking about The Cherry Orchard in general because as far as they are concerned the play is about Dunyasha or whoever it is they are playing. I admire that. But I am not like that at all. I take the view that doing your homework can't do any harm. I want to know everything about the world of the play.\" </p> <p>It shows. When West arrives from rehearsals for Steven Pimlott's RSC production of Hamlet, he proceeds to give a dazzling masterclass. It is hard to get a word in as he dissects the play, quoting not just his own part but everyone else's, and throwing in little asides on 17th century Catholic and Protestant theological attitudes to revenge and redemption. Before long he is demolishing the critical Tower of Babel that surrounds the play and analysing some of the 20-odd productions that he has seen. </p> <p>It sounds more like a director talking. West laughs, admits that he can get carried away and points out that he directed his own production of Hamlet for the RSC's fringe festival last summer. \"In the absence of better solutions, I will be nicking some things from that,\" says West. He admits that it took him a while to adjust from directing the play to being in it. \"I find myself thinking more and more like a director, and I know I have to watch that. You do have to make a choice. You can't be an actor and a director, especially not at the same time.\" </p> <p>He is enjoying being part of the RSC, after what he admits were \"too many years in TV limbo\" playing damaged upper-class people in the Merchant Ivory mould. \"In TV and film I am already considered old at 34, while in theatre it is possible to be at the start of a classical career, although I am wary of saying that. I love it that in the theatre you get employed because people think that you have the potential to play a role, whereas in TV and film they only cast you because they know that you can do it. </p> <p>\"A friend, the actor Leigh Lawson, said to me that the only time in his career when he didn't feel he should be somewhere else doing something else was when he was with the RSC. It has been like that for me. I find it moving that I've spent a year in a company of young actors speaking 400-year-old language with no apology and an almost revolutionary zeal. The zeitgeist is so much about not caring, about it being cool to mumble and be back footed. But you can't do that when you are speaking verse, and there is something that makes you feel happy to know that you are going out there and giving people pleasure.\" He pauses. \"Small dollops of pleasure. The number of people who will have seen Richard II during its entire run is smaller than the Saturday afternoon gate at Cardiff City.\" </p> <p>If West has one regret about doing Hamlet now, it is that we are living in a Hamlet age. \"It must have been thrilling to have been David Warner and played Hamlet in a Lear age, a world where you've got something to kick against,\" he sighs. He is referring to the 1965 production that cast Warner as a spokesman for a generation that was challenging the entrenched views of its parents. But what exactly is a Hamlet age? </p> <p>\"A Tony Blair age,\" says West. \"If Tony Blair isn't good casting for Claudius who smiles and smiles, who is? Oh yes, this is very much a Hamlet age. Doubts, cynicism, moral relativism, these are the norms now. It is hard to notice the bitterness in Denmark because there is so much sugar coating the pill. Hamlet is a character that exists in opposition, but it is hard to stand up to something that seems quite liberal. He is a man for our times because he distrusts himself. He is a worrier, not a warrior. Steven Pimlott described the play the other day as being like Gladiator with Woody Allen playing Russell Crowe.

The intifada against Israel's occupation of parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip marks a dismal milestone today: six months since Mr Sharon's early morning stroll around a disputed holy site in east Jerusalem set a torch to smouldering Palestinian resentments against the grindingly slow peace negotiations with Israel. Now, with more than 430 dead - and Shalhevet Pass, aged 10 months, joining the daily catalogue of horrors that have seen Jewish settlers the targets of drive-by shootings, and Arab protesters mown down by automatic fire or shelled in their homes - there is a growing sense that both peoples stand at a crossroads. Israelis heartily want the uprising to end. But does Mr Sharon bow to the clamour of Jewish settlers, led by the enclave in Hebron where Shalhevet was picked off in her pushchair, to invade Palestin ian-ruled territory? (Similar demands are coming from local army commanders.) Or, does he resist popular pressure and chart a more restrained course, turning his back on a 50-year personal history of dealing harshly with Israel's Arab neighbours? For the Palestinians, the choice is equally stark. Do they stop shooting, and if they do what do they gain? On the southern fringes of the Gaza Strip, the most active military front in the uprising, the field commanders of the uprising now openly admit they have lost their way. \"We as Palestinians don't know the aim of the intifada. Is it to enhance negotiations or is it to improve the situation in the West Bank and Gaza?\" said Mohammed al-Athamna, a colonel in military intelligence in Rafah. \"Even the people shooting have no great political understanding. They themselves do not know why they are shooting.\" Amid a growing realisation among leaders of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement that the Palestinians are trapped in senseless violence, last week saw an extraordinary meeting in Rafah, a dusty town of open sewers and mean refugee shanties shoved up against the Israeli-controlled security strip on the border with Egypt. Eight senior members of Mr Arafat's Palestinian Authority, and Fatah - including the deputy chief of security for Gaza, the Rafah governor, and security officials - decided to call a halt to shooting attacks from Rafah on two adjacent army camps, and on a strip of Jewish settlements opposite Khan Yunis refugee camp. The March 21 meeting was seen as a test case - if Fatah could persuade its own men to hold fire in Rafah then it would work to do the same in Hebron and elsewhere. It was a bitter decision. Along the border, Israeli bulldozers have ploughed into fields and homes to create a 70-metre security strip, and there is regular sniper fire from the high tower of the army camp where sentries can look right into people's homes. On most nights for the last six months, there has been shooting and shelling from the army base against the gunmen they believe are hiding in civilian homes. Several families have collected bucketfuls of shrapnel, and hung up wind chimes made of teargas canisters in their back gardens. \"The intifada has done nothing for me,\" said Tamam Abdel Ahl, aged, 63. Three of her sons have been wounded in the yard. \"May Allah take this catastrophe away from me.\" It was this kind of popular pressure from the civilians who have taken the brunt of Israeli reprisals that is pushing Fatah to rein in the gunmen. \"We have come to a dead end, and the next step depends on the Israelis,\" said Rashid Abu Shabak, the deputy chief of security in the Gaza Strip. To get Fatah's militiamen in Rafah and elsewhere to hold fire their leaders will have to persuade them that there will be some reward: that the army will lift its siege of towns, stop razing crops, and rein in the extremist Jewish settlers -and that Mr Sharon will negotiate. Prospects for that were destroyed by the sniper's bullet that killed Shalhevet, and the seemingly inevitable Israeli reprisals to come. Opinion in Israel's media yesterday strongly favoured a forceful move from Mr Sharon. \"A murder like this must have a price,\" Alex Fishman, a security analyst, wrote in Yediot Ahronoth, the largest daily. Elsewhere, Mr Sharon's advisers were quoted as saying that the gloves would come off at the end of the week - after the Arab summit now on in Amman, and the 25th anniversary of the Palestinians' Land Day on March 30. The killing of Shalhevet Pass could well provide the pretext Mr Sharon has been waiting for to revert to past form. Mr Arafat is stuck too, unable to issue public orders against shooting without compromising his political survival - especially if Mr Sharon intensifies Israel's military actions. Increasingly, the Palestinian gunmen are operating outside established control. \"I can't stop any work as long as there are violent acts on the other side,\" said Mahmoud Hussein, the top Fatah man in the Rafah region. \"We are completely aware that the intifada cannot achieve everything, but if I move away from the familiar path, I will be seen as an outsider.\" For all the war-weariness, Israel and the Palestinians are heading inexorably towards a new burst of bloodletting. www.pmo.gov.il/english Ariel Sharon's office www.fateh.net Fatah www.p-p-o.com Yasser Arafat's office",

      "bodyText": "Belgium went into mourning yesterday when its worst train crash for 25 years killed at least eight people, one a child, and seriously injured dozens more. A commuter train from Leuven, about 15 miles from Brussels, collided head-on with an empty train which appears to have ignored a red light. The death toll could rise, since many of the injured were said to be in a critical condition. Some reports put the number killed at twelve. Some passengers were trapped for several hours. Both drivers and one other railway official were killed. The force of the collision was such that some of the carriages were thrown into the air. Rescue workers were still struggling to recover the bodies from the mangled wreckage near the village of Pecrot yesterday afternoon, hours after the accident occurred during the rush hour. The state railway company, SNCB/NMBS, said it tried desperately to warn the driver of the empty train that he had passed a red light and was heading towards the commuter train at about 60mph. He failed to respond. \"We tried as a last resort to cut off the power, but unfortunately it was done too late,\" a spokeswoman said. A local resident, Anna-Marie Choumuerthe, said: \"There was a noise like two giant tin cans crashing together. \"I went out to see what happened and heard and saw people at the windows screaming.\" Another, Ameile Jassont, said: \"I saw a black cloud of smoke rise up.

But while there is near-unanimity that his predecessor, Ehud Barak, was a disappointment, there is also a division in attitudes, a Guardian straw poll of leaders and opinion-formers found. While many have hardened their opinions in the past six months, believing that most of the blame for the collapse of the peace process lies with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, others have redoubled their efforts to rebuild the peace process. Even many on the liberal left are prepared to give Mr Sharon the benefit of the doubt, in spite of his hardline background. Simon Plosker, a spokesman for the Board of Deputies, said it was too early to make a judgment about Mr Sharon but British Jews would support the government of national unity in its effort to end the violence. He said: \"It is safe to say there is immense disappointment with what has happened, and immense anxiety. Many people have concluded that the Palestinians have resorted to violence as a strategic aim.\" There was repeatedly expressed concern that the British press, and in particular the Guardian, had failed to report fairly what was happening, showed a pronounced bias against Israel, and tended to treat the Palestinians as the underdog. Mr Plosker said the great majority of the Jewish community believed the coverage was slanted, had not portrayed the reality on the ground, and sought to blame Israel for the whole situation. Unhappiness with press coverage prompted the formation of the Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre, to try to redress the balance.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of protesters were gathering in the north German town of Dannenberg last night as a heavily guarded train carrying nuclear waste edged its way towards the point where the waste will be transferred to lorries for the remainder of its journey to the nuclear dump in Gorleben. A group in masks dragged large concrete cylinders across roads leading to Dannenberg in an attempt to disrupt the security operation mounted by the biggest police deployment since the second world war: up to 20,000 officers equipped with water cannon, helicopters and night-vision aids. The campaigners formed a long line along a ridge overlooking the Dannenberg terminal. Opposite them were ranged police officers in full riot gear, flanked by a water cannon. Throughout the day demonstrators in various parts of Germany managed to break on to stretches of the railway line on the train's tortuous 375-mile journey from the French border. They succeeded in delaying, but not stopping, its progress. The 60 tonnes of nuclear waste in six sealed containers was diverted to avoid the university city of G\u00f6ttingen, where hundreds of people briefly occupied the tracks. Dozens of people were arrested along the route. The biggest confrontation of the day occurred at the village of Wendisch Evern, where several hundred protesters broke through the police lines to occupy part of the railway. Within seconds they had linked arms. On the field above the police succeeded in wrestling some of them to the ground, blocking others. Among those dragged away by the police was a young child clutching a teddy bear. Protesters chanted \"Is this democracy?\" One police officer lost his patience and shouted \"Just walk!\" Veit B\u00fcrger of Greenpeace said the protesters, adopting new tactics, were divided into small scattered groups, \"all of whom are trying to get at the line\". The police claimed that the protesters numbered only 2,000. The authorities had tried to stop them getting on the tracks, the police spokesman, Wolfgang Klages, said, but the route was too long to have hundreds of officers at every point. \"In some places, we have to react.\" Watched by Franziska Lohmann, 25, and her infant son, who live near by, police special forces in black face masks were trying to disengage a group of Greenpeace activists dangling in harnesses from the underside of a bridge over a tributary of the Elbe. Eventually they resorted to a chainsaw to sever the steel wires, and one of the protesters fell with a loud splash into the shallow water below. For the most part the police were restrained, and appeared reluctant even to draw their batons. But last night they said that two demonstrators had been injured. The protest organisers put the figure at five. France and Germany agreed in January to resume the shipments, and the German environment minister, J\u00fcrgen Trittin, a leading member of the Green party, has defended the decision on the grounds that safety precautions have been tightened since the previous administration suspended the shipments in 1998 because of radioactive leaks from some containers. From the end of the rail line in Dannenberg, flatbed trucks will take the six containers, each with about 10 tonnes of radioactive waste sealed in 28 glass casks, to the hotly opposed Gorleben nuclear waste dump. Unloading of the containers is expected to take up to 12 hours, during which time they will be measured for radioactivity. The shipment contains waste left over when spent nuclear fuel from German power plants was reprocessed at a French plant. The decision to allow the shipment put the Greens, the junior partners in the coalition federal government, in a tough position, facing accusations of betrayal from some of their core supporters.",

      "bodyText": "Israel's prime minister Ariel Sharon vowed last night to take decisive action to avenge the death of a baby girl killed by a sniper's bullet and a twin bombing in Jerusalem yesterday. As the parents of 10-month-old Shalhevet Pass refused to bury their daughter until Mr Sharon invades Palestinian-ruled land near the Jewish enclave of Hebron, rightwing politicians called for a tough response to a suicide attack on a bus in the French Hill settlement, northern Jerusalem, which killed the bomber and injured more than 30 people. \"Considering the events which have taken place, we should have no more restraint,\" said Jerusalem's rightwing mayor, Ehud Olmert. However, Israeli soldiers may find themselves accused of lacking any restraint following the death of an 11-year-old Palestinian boy near Hebron yesterday. A cousin said the boy was watching a firefight between Palestinian gunmen and Israeli soldiers when he was shot from the Israeli position. Doctors in Hebron hospital said Mahmoud Ismail Daraweesh was shot in the heart. The Israeli army said it had no information on the death near Dura, south of Hebron, but confirmed that its soldiers had traded fire with Palestinian gunmen at the nearby Al-Fawwar refugee camp.

A young settler wearing a T-shirt with Hebrew letters reading: \"I only buy from Jews\" joined a charge up the hill to Abu Sneineh before being beaten back by cordons of security forces.

At least eight MSF armed guards were killed when fighting broke out at the gates of the compound as the foreign aid workers' convoy was heading out to visit a polio vaccination programme early yesterday. The UN team is monitoring MSF's work. A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed last night that three Britons were among the UN staff abducted: \"We do not have an embassy there. The UN are the people on the ground and they are dealing with the situation.\" Last night, the interior minister in the Somali provisional government, Dahir Dayah, told Reuters he had sent government forces on what he called a rescue mission. Five of the aid workers - two Spanish and one French MSF worker and two Unicef employees - were safe in a house in northern Mogadishu, MSF and UN spokeswomen said. \"Our understanding is that they are safe and that they can leave when the security situation calms down,\" said Samantha Bolton, a spokeswoman for MSF in Nairobi. The other UN staff, from Britain, Algeria, the US and Somalia, were split into two groups and were in separate locations said to be controlled by the Mogadishu warlord Musa Sude Yalahow.

The attack was reportedly a continuation of fighting the previous day between the guards, a local clan militia, and a rival faction loyal to Mr Yalahow, one of a handful of warlords opposing the new UN-sponsored transitional government set up in October. It has now degenerated into a confrontation between the fledgling government and Mr Yalahow. Abdulkadir Mohamed Mohamud, an aide to Mr Yalahow, said yesterday he was holding the hostages in areas his faction controls to show the world that Somalia's new government has not brought peace. \"All I want to show the international community is that Mogadishu is not a safe place. We'll release them soon,\" he said. \"It is outrageous that a team trying to do humanitarian work was attacked,\" said Kevin Farrell, acting UN humanitarian coordinator for Somalia. \"We need to be able to work in a safe environment. Conflicts like this only derail our efforts to help the Somali people in any meaningful way.\"",

Well, he's a car dealer. He has, says Kray, \"got it all\" - \"a string of birds, a lovely family and a nice gaff in Epping Forest\". In this gaff, he has a Forever Friends clock and a couple of toy trolls with pink hair, so still a bit of a question mark over the sanity thing. </p> <p>With the clear implication that here was an ordinary decent criminal - \"The geezer whose throat I cut was a grass\", he explained - Hard Bastards was amoral and superficial. A Lock, Stock Timewatch, it contained a little too much affection and warmth for a man who spent most of his life terrorising folks and once threw his estranged wife's boyfriend from a balcony.

Her youth has also helped turn her into an international publishing sensation. So far her beauty has not been a hindrance. </p> <p><b> Jenny Colgan, 28</b> </p> <p>Her first novel, Amanda's Wedding, a twentysomething urban comedy, earned her a \u00a31.2m advance from HarperCollins which included a film rights deal with Warner Brothers. </p> <p>Classified by snooty critics as another one of the trivial \"Chick Lit\" brigade, she coined the alternative term Bliggers, meaning Brit Lit It Girls. Bliggers, she claims, are between 25 and 35 and rather than writing aspirational Bridget Jonesy nonsense, are trying to reflect the real-life dilemmas of urban, professional women. Currently living in LA where she is working on her third novel. </p> <p><b> Louise Bagshawe, 29</b> </p> <p>While Jenkins seems to court publicity, Bagshawe runs from it. There was a sharp intake of breath when she landed a \u00a370,000 two-book deal at just 23. But it was money well spent because her debut novel, Career Girls, sold over 200,000 copies as did her next three books. Last year she was valued at \u00a32m. </p> <p><b> Jake Arnott, 40</b> </p> <p>A little old to be truly classified as a handsome young thing, nonetheless Arnott was well-preserved enough to adorn newspapers and magazines everywhere when his first book, The London Firm, was published to great acclaim two years ago. As one reviewer declared: \"It doesn't matter he's no young prodigy. He's 38, so what? Those eyes, that look - part brute, part boy.\" </p> <p><b> Tobias Hill, 30</b> </p> <p>Went to Hampstead comprehensive in London with Zadie Smith, though no one has yet thrown any big-money advances his way despite his Byronic good looks. This may be because he made his name as a poet, who publishers seem to believe deserve to starve. Embarrassingly good reviews for his novels, Underground (1999) and The Love of Stones, seem to have made little difference. </p> <p><b> Amy Jenkins, 34</b> </p> <p>Having taken telly by storm by creating the cult series This Life, and becoming a staple of every glossy magazine in the country, her literary career has yet to reach the same heights.

      "bodyText": "Zadie Smith, 25 The winner of the Guardian First Book award has been shortlisted for just about every literary prize on the planet for her \"breathtaking\" debut novel, White Teeth, a dazzling romp through multicultural north London. Her youth has also helped turn her into an international publishing sensation. So far her beauty has not been a hindrance. Jenny Colgan, 28 Her first novel, Amanda's Wedding, a twentysomething urban comedy, earned her a \u00a31.2m advance from HarperCollins which included a film rights deal with Warner Brothers. Classified by snooty critics as another one of the trivial \"Chick Lit\" brigade, she coined the alternative term Bliggers, meaning Brit Lit It Girls. Bliggers, she claims, are between 25 and 35 and rather than writing aspirational Bridget Jonesy nonsense, are trying to reflect the real-life dilemmas of urban, professional women. Currently living in LA where she is working on her third novel. Louise Bagshawe, 29 While Jenkins seems to court publicity, Bagshawe runs from it. There was a sharp intake of breath when she landed a \u00a370,000 two-book deal at just 23. But it was money well spent because her debut novel, Career Girls, sold over 200,000 copies as did her next three books. Last year she was valued at \u00a32m. Jake Arnott, 40 A little old to be truly classified as a handsome young thing, nonetheless Arnott was well-preserved enough to adorn newspapers and magazines everywhere when his first book, The London Firm, was published to great acclaim two years ago. As one reviewer declared: \"It doesn't matter he's no young prodigy. He's 38, so what? Those eyes, that look - part brute, part boy.\" Tobias Hill, 30 Went to Hampstead comprehensive in London with Zadie Smith, though no one has yet thrown any big-money advances his way despite his Byronic good looks. This may be because he made his name as a poet, who publishers seem to believe deserve to starve. Embarrassingly good reviews for his novels, Underground (1999) and The Love of Stones, seem to have made little difference. Amy Jenkins, 34 Having taken telly by storm by creating the cult series This Life, and becoming a staple of every glossy magazine in the country, her literary career has yet to reach the same heights. Despite receiving a \u00a3600,000 two-book deal on the strength of one chapter of her first novel, Honey Moon, it was a critical disaster. Sales, despite blanket coverage, have been very disappointing. Alex Garland, 31 The richest and most successful of the new generation of British writers. Son of a well-connected cartoonist, his first novel, The Beach - about the dark side of a lotus-eating year backpacking in Thailand - was reprinted 25 times in less than a year. He was described by one critic as a publisher's dream: clever, young and startlingly handsome.",

Renault's new Laguna was given a five-star rating by the European New Car Assessment Programme, reflecting a big leap forward in car safety. However, road safety campaigners were dismayed that the advances in passenger safety design had not been matched by similar protection for pedestrians. The Laguna, launched in the UK a month ago, performed exceptionally well in front and side impact tests, as well as in NCAP's new head protection test, which involves crashing the car at 17mph on to a narrow pole with a sideways blow. The force involved in such a crash can be more than five times the minimum amount required to cause a serious brain injury. The Laguna's body structure and eight airbags, including one fitted into the ceiling to protect front and rear passengers, has reduced the force to less than a fifth of the minimum injury value. Max Mosley, NCAP chairman, said: \"We are delighted with the performance of the new Renault Laguna. \"Some manufacturers said that it would be impossible to achieve the fifth Euro NCAP star, but in less than a year since its introduction Renault has succeeded in setting a benchmark in crashworthiness.\" But in pedestrian safety tests the car was awarded only two stars out of five. The NCAP report concluded: \"Pedestrian protection unfortunately has not improved in the same manner as occupant protection.\" Edmund King, executive director of the RAC Foundation, said: \"Renault and the other manufacturers should now concentrate on improving pedestrian safety, which is the one area which has not seen dramatic improvements in the last few years.\" Zoe Stow, chairman of the road crash victims group Roadpeace, said: \"We welcome any advances in safety but design is only part of the equation. \"It doesn't matter how many safety features a car has if a speeding driver hits a pedestrian.\"",

The court heard Grimson then got angry and told Mr Jenkins if he did not have sex with him he would hurt him, and punched him. The pair had sex. In the morning Mr Jenkins had said he wanted to leave. Grimson said he wanted the same feeling he had experienced killing Mr Wright. He bound Mr Jenkins in the bath and put a towel over his head, he said, to avoid the mess of the previous killing. Grimson picked up the baseball bat and took some practice swings before he landed what Mr Donne described as a \"sickening thud\" on the head of Mr Jenkins. He landed six more blows on his head killing him. But Grimson said he had not got the same thrill out of killing the barman. Press Association",

If Liberal Democrat votes go up in all kinds of seats, electoral reform will suddenly reappear on the political agenda. Tony Greaves House of Lords \u0095 If the problem with calling an election during the foot and mouth crisis is not the election itself, but the election campaign, then there is a clear solution. Let the government call an election and pledge not to campaign. All of the other parties would be bound to follow and we could elect the next parliament on the basis of experience. Money that would have been spent on the campaign could be donated, by both major parties, to schools, thus fulfilling part of their election pledges early. Who knows, we might find we like it too. Alan Craig Shadforth, Durham alan@shadforth.u-net.com \u0095 If our general election was based on a fixed four year term, would the Tories still be so keen to urge the government to postpone May 3?

      "body": "<p>In a south London tower block, four-year-old Ali and five-year-old Aisha share one room with their mother, Fatma. An uncertain future awaits them. Fatma has no money to buy the children toys, or even pencils and paper. They don't go to school, so Fatma has to choose between closeting them in the room with her, or letting them play in the corridors and public areas of the tower block, where groups of young men hang about most of the day. There's an anarchic feeling about the place. Tensions are running high and it is plainly not a healthy environment for two young children. </p> <p>The family has been there for three weeks already and Fatma has no idea how long it will be before they are moved on - nor where they will be moved on to. They could be waiting days, weeks or even months. She can expect to be given 24 hours' notice that they are moving. </p> <p>The local social services department is unaware of the children's existence. In fact, Aisha and Ali are not covered by the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, as it has been adopted by Britain. This is because they and their mother came to Britain from Turkey, seeking asylum. They are in emergency accommodation with other asylum seekers, awaiting \"dispersal\" to another part of the country. </p> <p>Although families are supposed to stay in emergency accommodation for a few days only, in practice many remain there for weeks or months. Often this is because of the nature of the system, where lost paperwork, long drawn-out decision-making and general confusion are the norm. Sometimes it is because asylum seekers fear being \"dispersed\". They have heard stories of grim conditions, racial abuse and attacks, isolation and lack of social, legal and language support in the dispersal areas. </p> <p>The net result is that an unknown number of children languish in a kind of limbo for weeks or months, living in accommodation designed for a seven-day stay, often going without books, toys, and educational facilities. </p> <p>Stephanie White, a volunteer who works with asylum seekers and refugees in London, is concerned that there is no one to champion the cause of such children. \"I know of several children who have been living in 'temporary' accommodation for at least four months,\" she says. \"Many of the long-stayers are particularly vulnerable; children with medical problems or whose parents have medical problems. However, even if the system worked perfectly, there would always be a certain number of children in each hostel at any one time. These are traumatised children who are entitled to a safe place to play while they wait to be dispersed.\" </p> <p>Jill Rutter, education policy adviser at the Refugee Council, says: \"One of our key concerns is that families are spending too long in emergency accommodation, where all they get is three meals a day. There are no play facilities for children in emergency accommodation, and parents are stuck there with their kids for 24 hours a day.\" </p> <p>The charity would like to see the government provide funding to give children living in emergency accommodation a safe place to play with shared toys and facilities. Alasdair Mackenzie, coordinator of Asylum Aid, another charity working with asylum seekers, agrees: \"The lack of education, play facilities and child protection would be a less acute problem if children really were passing through emergency accommodation in a few days, as planned. But plainly, as the system isn't working and that isn't happening, these are all issues the government needs to address.\" </p> <p>On paper, all children here as dependants of asylum seekers are entitled to receive schooling. \"It is government policy that asylum seekers' children of compulsory school age are given the same opportunities to benefit from what schools can offer them,\" a Home Office spokesperson confirms. But as Jill Rutter says: \"The children waiting to be dispersed have theoretical rights to education, but they are not encouraged to approach local schools because the disruption to schools would be enormous.\" </p> <p>Children are therefore normally allocated a school place only once they have left emergency accommodation. There are one or two isolated examples of good practice: the local education authority (LEA) in Croydon, south London, provides English classes and an induction to education for children and their parents in emergency accommodation. But funding for such initiatives is scarce. </p> <p>Last year, \u00a31.5m additional funding was committed to support the education costs of children of asylum seekers dispersed to local authorities in the so-called \"cluster\" areas. But schools in London and the south-east - the areas where many children end up staying for long periods - did not qualify. The funding runs out at the end of this month and there has so far been no announcement about the next financial year. </p> <p>Even when families approach a school or LEA, however, it may be some time before their child can be offered a place: the Refugee Council's best estimate is that 2,000 children who are either seeking asylum or have been granted refugee status are on school waiting lists. The number who are not even on a waiting list is unknown. </p> <p>On paper, asylum seekers and their dependants are also entitled to receive medical treatment under the NHS. But, in practice, it is not always so easy. Asylum seekers in temporary accommodation could be moved on at any time. This, and language problems, makes signing on with a GP difficult and, in a crisis, help can be hard to come by. </p> <p>\"Some of the families have told me that local doctors won't accept them,\" says Sirtaj Rahman, manager and outreach worker with the Finsbury Park Homeless Families Project, which works with refugee families in north London. She was present at a hotel one day when a woman asylum seeker had terrible back pains and was unable to stand. \"She desperately needed a doctor and her family were all crying. They called for an ambulance four times, but the ambulance refused to come. They said they wouldn't come to the hostel any more because too many people had been calling when there wasn't any emergency. I had to find some money and give it to them, and then her husband and family carried her out to a minicab which took her to hospital.\" </p> <p>So who is looking out for children of asylum-seeking or refugee families? Social services departments are only responsible for unaccompanied children and are struggling to cope with them. Neither the national asylum support service (NASS), which is responsible for the dispersal programme and for supporting asylum seekers until their claims are decided, nor the Refugee Council has the resources to address the specific needs of children in emergency accommodation. </p> <p>White thinks it is high time that named individuals were made responsible. \"At the moment,\" she says, \"it's impossible to find out where the buck stops.\"</p>",

It was an ordeal for the small band of church-sponsored volunteers, but it proved the catalyst for a radical rethink on how the estate could be regenerated. </p> <p>Back in 1996, tenants living near a boarded-up pub in Sheffield's Burngreave district were furious that \"do-gooders\" were moving in. A group of Baptists setting up shop in what had been The Furnival pub was not going to help local people convince the brewery to reopen its doors. They wanted a pub again, not a community centre. </p> <p>The initial confrontation between an angry crowd of tenants and the four community workers was the first time Jane Grinonneau met Josie Stocks. Grinonneau was the Baptist minister leading the team that had moved into the pub to set up a \"faith-based neighbourhood resource\". Stocks was at the front of the crowd of men and women who wanted the team out. </p> <p>It was the start of a relationship that was to see the two women, from wholly different backgrounds, working together for the benefit of the community. \"It took time for us to gain the trust of the people on the estate\", says Grinonneau. \"But because we persevered - and they persevered with us - we started to get somewhere. We started to listen to what the community was saying, rather than telling them what we thought they should do. We began to realise that much of what's said about regeneration doesn't have a place on an estate like this. It had nothing to do with the lives of people living here.\" </p> <p>The community workers won the confidence of Stocks and her neighbours. \"They started to ask us what we wanted, rather than take it for granted,\" she says. \"Lots of social and community workers come along thinking they know it all. Jane soon realised we would work with her and her team, but only if they listened to us.\" </p> <p>Now the two women who stood face-to-face five years ago work side-by-side at Verdon Street Enterprises, a community-based initiative centred on The Furnival community cafe and a row of converted shops. The enterprises include a launderette, a healthy housing project, a citizen's advice centre and a nearly-new shop. Local residents, many of them teenagers, are involved in skills training. There is a credit union and a joblink scheme. Funding from varied sources has financed 10 full-time posts, with many more part-time workers and volunteers getting involved in a range of schemes. It is evidently part of the community and the community is evidently part of the project. </p> <p>Not only do the two women work together, they are also near-neighbours. Stocks has lived one minute's walk from The Furnival for the 18 years she has been on the estate; Grinonneau moved into one of the many empty flats when she went to work there. She felt she had to, and she has been proved right. Living alongside the people she was there to help has given her a fresh insight into the problems of regeneration. </p> <p>While many clamour for regeneration \"from the bottom up\", Stocks and Grinonneau believe that merely giving a say to people at the bottom does not empower them. Those at the top have already drawn up the strategies and the structures before those at the foot of the pile are consulted. </p> <p>\"The typical regeneration strategy is for people who already know what is best for communities to dictate to them from a great distance what the desired outcomes are of that regeneration,\" says Grinonneau. \"Questions are asked as to why people in communities don't participate. Well, why should they when they are neither seen nor heard?\" </p> <p>Stocks argues that those in charge of deciding how an area is regenerated should spend time living there. \"Those who have got the advantage need to be among those who haven't,\" she says. \"They have to be willing to learn the language. They have to be willing to be there and listen.\" </p> <p>Burngreave is one of the New Deal for Communities projects. The statistics show why: the suicide rate among women is 60% higher than the national average; 82% of children live in families that have no wages; and 44% of households have a net weekly income of less than \u00a3200. Up to \u00a350m could be on its way to the area. Paradoxically, though, The Furnival cafe faces the loss of its funding. </p> <p>\"We have had all sorts of funding these past five years and we have had a good crack of the whip,\" says Grinonneau. \"But it does seem somehow ironic that New Deal is about listening to communities and, just as the first of the \u00a350m comes to Burngreave, Josie - the woman who for the past five years has taught us what we needed to know - could well be out of a job.\"</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Over the past 12 years, life in the English high security hospitals could be likened to existence in a disputed stronghold in a protracted civil war. The hospitals - Ashworth, Broadmoor and Rampton - have undergone three management reorganisations; been subject to two statutory inquiries; witnessed escapes, suicides, murders and a nurses' strike; and been accused of racial intolerance and ill-treatment of patients. </p> <p>The units have seen many managers and clinical leaders arrive with enthusiasm, later to depart downcast if not disgraced. There have been repeated calls for the hospitals to be closed. They have been savaged by the media and have opened doors, only to close them again. They have been told they are unmanageable and hopelessly institutionalised. They have been ordered to become part of the NHS, but then classified as equivalent to category B prisons. </p> <p>Patient numbers have fallen from 1,715 in 1989 to 1,292 in 1999, but demand for admission remains high, with \"waiting lists\" in operation. The units have been declared incompetent in their handling of personality disordered patients, yet then proposed as the site for a \"new approach\" for just such patients. </p> <p>In the middle of this maelstrom, the hospitals somehow continue to function and even make optimistic noises - now generally in muted tones - about their future. And, even more surprisingly, many dedicated staff still feel it worth working in such a turbid environment. There is surely no theory of management, or of psychiatric or psychological practice, which would seriously suggest that such a random battering was an appropriate way to define a service for patients with the most severe psychiatric illnesses - potentially or actually dangerous - or to motivate staff to provide that service. </p> <p>In part, the story represents the changing priorities of society, nicely reflected in the purpose and content of the two statutory inquiries into Ashworth, on Merseyside. The first, led by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC in 1992, was the last in a long line of formal inquiries into abuse and ill-treatment in large psychiatric hospitals. It produced vignettes of corrupted professional standards and it advocated liberal remedies, rooted in respect for the individual. The second, chaired by Peter Fallon QC in 1999, investigated allegations of criminal behaviour and loss of control by professional staff. It devised a recipe of tighter control and exclusion of undesirable individuals. Fallon reflected the current public mood: increasing distrust of doctors; growing desire for revenge and explicit punishments; greater accountability; and, above all, aversion to risk. </p> <p>Yet the recent history of the \"specials\" also reflects the dedicated efforts of groups and individuals to introduce change within the institutions, and in their relationship with the NHS, the criminal justice system and other agencies. This work is, in many ways, at the frontiers of knowledge and professional competence. There is success and achievement, but it cannot be guaranteed and is not always understood. Among peer groups, such uncertainty can usually be accepted; but to the public and political audience, it is a matter for scepticism. What is risk to the professional is seen by the general public as danger and threat. </p> <p>Within these difficulties, staff also share the fear and anxiety: their vulnerability, personal and professional, is very real - and largely discounted. What they can do is not generally valued and what they are unable to achieve is written in headlines. Unfortunately, it is now impossible for the hospitals to operate out of sight, since they are established as a rich reservoir of material; they share the stigma that they attach indelibly to their patients. \"Crazed killers\" are good copy - whether they are being mollycoddled or let free. So what lies in store for the specials? Another decade of criticism and obloquy? What incentives are to be offered to staff to retain their commitment? </p> <p>Reviewing the painful haemorrhage of effort to improve the hospitals - the closure of which ministers have firmly ruled out - it becomes obvious that change cannot be achieved by taking them in isolation. We have a national forensic service started almost 30 years ago: it is no longer realistic or fair to pretend that the problems in a high-security hospital are phenomena solely of their own making, unrelated to the way in which the balance of the national service is operating. In reality, high security has been acting as a lightning conductor, earthing the shocks and protecting the rest of the forensic establishment. </p> <p>What is required is a vertical reassessment of forensic care, pursuing issues right through the spectrum of facilities - including the all-important contribution of the independent sector. Starting next week, each of the three specials is to be merged with other mental health services to form new trusts. By placing high-security and medium-security units under one command - immediately, in the cases of Broadmoor in Berkshire and Rampton in Nottinghamshire, and at a later date at Ashworth - there is the possibility of reviewing thoughtfully the inter-relationship of these previously and artificially separate facilities. </p> <p>Such a sea change will need to cut through the rivalries, insecurities and contempt which often characterise present arrangements. And it will need to be measured primarily not in the superficial trappings of management speak - divisions, directorates and boards - but in real change in clinical practice. Psychiatrists in particular, and clinical teams in general, will need to behave and work on a patient-focused basis, giving up their territorial preoccupations. One service, one staff and shared standards. </p> <p>Within three years, we should expect to be able to measure progress by criteria which will include: a \"life care plan\" for each patient; quality measures for physical conditions, clinical expertise and use of control techniques; and a guarantee that no patient need wait longer than three months for transfer or discharge once the next step is formally agreed.

      "bodyText": "Over the past 12 years, life in the English high security hospitals could be likened to existence in a disputed stronghold in a protracted civil war. The hospitals - Ashworth, Broadmoor and Rampton - have undergone three management reorganisations; been subject to two statutory inquiries; witnessed escapes, suicides, murders and a nurses' strike; and been accused of racial intolerance and ill-treatment of patients. The units have seen many managers and clinical leaders arrive with enthusiasm, later to depart downcast if not disgraced. There have been repeated calls for the hospitals to be closed. They have been savaged by the media and have opened doors, only to close them again. They have been told they are unmanageable and hopelessly institutionalised. They have been ordered to become part of the NHS, but then classified as equivalent to category B prisons. Patient numbers have fallen from 1,715 in 1989 to 1,292 in 1999, but demand for admission remains high, with \"waiting lists\" in operation. The units have been declared incompetent in their handling of personality disordered patients, yet then proposed as the site for a \"new approach\" for just such patients. In the middle of this maelstrom, the hospitals somehow continue to function and even make optimistic noises - now generally in muted tones - about their future. And, even more surprisingly, many dedicated staff still feel it worth working in such a turbid environment. There is surely no theory of management, or of psychiatric or psychological practice, which would seriously suggest that such a random battering was an appropriate way to define a service for patients with the most severe psychiatric illnesses - potentially or actually dangerous - or to motivate staff to provide that service. In part, the story represents the changing priorities of society, nicely reflected in the purpose and content of the two statutory inquiries into Ashworth, on Merseyside. The first, led by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC in 1992, was the last in a long line of formal inquiries into abuse and ill-treatment in large psychiatric hospitals. It produced vignettes of corrupted professional standards and it advocated liberal remedies, rooted in respect for the individual. The second, chaired by Peter Fallon QC in 1999, investigated allegations of criminal behaviour and loss of control by professional staff. It devised a recipe of tighter control and exclusion of undesirable individuals. Fallon reflected the current public mood: increasing distrust of doctors; growing desire for revenge and explicit punishments; greater accountability; and, above all, aversion to risk. Yet the recent history of the \"specials\" also reflects the dedicated efforts of groups and individuals to introduce change within the institutions, and in their relationship with the NHS, the criminal justice system and other agencies. This work is, in many ways, at the frontiers of knowledge and professional competence. There is success and achievement, but it cannot be guaranteed and is not always understood. Among peer groups, such uncertainty can usually be accepted; but to the public and political audience, it is a matter for scepticism. What is risk to the professional is seen by the general public as danger and threat. Within these difficulties, staff also share the fear and anxiety: their vulnerability, personal and professional, is very real - and largely discounted. What they can do is not generally valued and what they are unable to achieve is written in headlines. Unfortunately, it is now impossible for the hospitals to operate out of sight, since they are established as a rich reservoir of material; they share the stigma that they attach indelibly to their patients. \"Crazed killers\" are good copy - whether they are being mollycoddled or let free. So what lies in store for the specials? Another decade of criticism and obloquy? What incentives are to be offered to staff to retain their commitment? Reviewing the painful haemorrhage of effort to improve the hospitals - the closure of which ministers have firmly ruled out - it becomes obvious that change cannot be achieved by taking them in isolation. We have a national forensic service started almost 30 years ago: it is no longer realistic or fair to pretend that the problems in a high-security hospital are phenomena solely of their own making, unrelated to the way in which the balance of the national service is operating. In reality, high security has been acting as a lightning conductor, earthing the shocks and protecting the rest of the forensic establishment. What is required is a vertical reassessment of forensic care, pursuing issues right through the spectrum of facilities - including the all-important contribution of the independent sector. Starting next week, each of the three specials is to be merged with other mental health services to form new trusts. By placing high-security and medium-security units under one command - immediately, in the cases of Broadmoor in Berkshire and Rampton in Nottinghamshire, and at a later date at Ashworth - there is the possibility of reviewing thoughtfully the inter-relationship of these previously and artificially separate facilities. Such a sea change will need to cut through the rivalries, insecurities and contempt which often characterise present arrangements. And it will need to be measured primarily not in the superficial trappings of management speak - divisions, directorates and boards - but in real change in clinical practice. Psychiatrists in particular, and clinical teams in general, will need to behave and work on a patient-focused basis, giving up their territorial preoccupations. One service, one staff and shared standards. Within three years, we should expect to be able to measure progress by criteria which will include: a \"life care plan\" for each patient; quality measures for physical conditions, clinical expertise and use of control techniques; and a guarantee that no patient need wait longer than three months for transfer or discharge once the next step is formally agreed. None of the three units should have more than 300 resident patients. It may be unrealistic to expect the general public, the media or even the politicians to see secure care as anything other than a social sump, embarrassment or target. But the NHS and all the caring professions have a responsibility to act with different expectations and better information. They have the capacity to lift the siege, and create and sustain a better service. \u0095 Charles Kaye was chief executive of the former special hospitals service authority from 1989-96.

A pity, then, that nobody seemed to be listening. The failure of so much municipal postwar housing has been well chronicled. \"You only have to look around here,\" says Wilkins, whose company is based between the city centre and a god-forsaken former council estate where unwanted \"units\" of accommodation are on sale for \u00a31 each. </p> <p>Across town, in similarly deprived Nechells, a small part of the inner city has recently been transformed into a mini-Bournville, as the Village Trust continues its founder's philosophy of trying to improve the living conditions of the poor.

It was always the Cadbury way to emphasise the benefits of exercise: \"A child brought up in the back streets of our cities is handicapped in mind, body and spirit,\" George Cadbury wrote to Lloyd George in 1916. He went on to point out that children of 12 born and raised in Bournville were, on average, two and a half inches taller and with three-inch bigger chests than those from the slums of Birmingham. </p> <p>\"Although people aren't starving in the streets today, the need is just the same as it was in George's day,\" says the trust's director of estates, Alan Shrimpton. He is, though, conscious that the Nechells development is small-scale, involving just 59 households - an example of what could be done, rather than a wholesale solution to the problems of the inner city. </p> <p>There is more scope to create what he calls \"Bournville Mark Two\" on a much larger site in Telford. On land owned by English Partnerships, the trust is building a brand new Shropshire village. There will be 750 homes (to rent and for owner-occupation) together with offices, a community centre and - believe it or not - a pub. \"We've been persuaded that it's needed for what the planners call social glue,\" says Shrimpton, doubtfully. </p> <p>Dylan Thomas would have approved. George Cadbury most certainly would not. The nine Cadburys who still sit on the trust's 12-strong board have softened only slightly the family's hard line on alcoholic drink which he laid down 100 years ago. Rumour has it that he would evict tenants if he found alcohol on the premises. Not true, Shrimpton assures me. But he goes on to add with a grin: \"It is said that residents used to carry bottles around in violin cases for fear of being spotted.\" </p> <p>The original Bournville today still has its idyllic village green, flanked by twee half-timbered shops, red telephone boxes and a church with a carillon that chimes out popular hymns at regular intervals. But there is no public house and no off-licence around the green or anywhere else in the garden suburb. \"The residents have consistently voted to stay dry,\" Shrimpton says. There is a feeling, he concedes, that licensed premises might add to the problems of vandalism and burglary that have seeped into the social fabric of Bournville. </p> <p>These usually quiet avenues of sturdily-built semis are not divorced from the realities of city life. Half of the trust's 7,000 properties here are owner-occupied and the other half are to let on the basis of social need. The vast majority of incoming tenants are on housing benefit. Grants of up to \u00a3250 are made available by the trust so that tenants can buy carpets, a cooker and that essential of Bournville life - a lawnmower. </p> <p>\"We're still paternalistic and we make no excuse for that - social engineering still sits comfortably with us,\" proclaims Shrimpton, a Cadbury man through and through. Both his parents worked at the factory - his father from the age of 14 until 65 and his mother until she married. \"Girls\", as women were traditionally referred to in Bournville, were expected to give up work and become home-makers as soon as they tripped down the aisle. Until well after the second world war, it was customary to see women surreptitiously removing their wedding rings on their way to work. </p> <p>George Cadbury, who lived until 1922, thought nothing of issuing his tenants with \"suggested rules of health\". They were advised, for instance, to \"breathe through the nostrils with the mouth closed, especially at night\", and to furnish their \"sleeping apartments\" with single beds. \"Double beds are now little used in civilised countries, except the United Kingdom,\" he assured them. Cold baths were recommended. Eating between meals was not. </p> <p>No snacking on chocolate, then. And certainly no \"intoxicating liquors\".

      "body": "<p>Twelve-year-old Eamonn stands in the middle of the roaring crowd and beams with delight. He and his friend, Dean, are clearly having the time of their lives. Eamonn and Dean have come to Belfast's new Odyssey Arena to cheer on their heroes, the Belfast Giants ice hockey team. Asked what they like best about this North American sport, the answer comes straight back: \"The fights!\" </p> <p>Eamonn and Dean are among a group of children, of all religions and none, on a visit organised by the local police as part of a community relations project. Before the arrival of the Giants, a cross-community trip to a sporting event here would have been near impossible. Traditional sport in Northern Ireland has been riven by tribal divisions. But the arrival of big league ice hockey has changed all that. At these games, fights are all part of the spectacle, but the violence stays strictly on the ice and the vast crowds of spectators are united in support of their team. </p> <p>The Belfast Giants were formed last year to play in the UK's ice hockey Superleague. The team - whose members are all Canadian, save for a lone American - got off to a sluggish start but rallied in December, when the arena opened and the Giants began playing at home. Support for the team surged as it won nine consecutive home games at the beginning of the year. Attendance has exceeded all expectations, the averagie 6,500 crowd being a near sell-out and making the Giants the best supported team in the league. </p> <p>\"I'm very proud,\" says John, a 40-something dad draped in a Giants shirt and scarf and flanked by his son, Stewart. \"It's only our first season and I'm over the moon to finally have a sport everybody loves. There isn't the tribalism there is in football. With us only having the one team that's for all of Belfast, everybody supports them, and I think that's important.\" </p> <p>At the merchandising kiosk, queues have built as fans snap up goods ranging from rubber pucks to Giants shirts, hats and jackets. Kiosk supervisor Marion Livingstone says: \"Belfast has been crying out for something like this. Soccer's been hijacked on either side of the divide; if you supported one team you were either a Catholic or a Protestant. But it hasn't come into this. It's a sport for all.\" </p> <p>The near-universal popularity of the Giants is not fortuitous, but the result of a carefully orchestrated marketing campaign. The team's communications director, Peter Collins, has worked hard at selling ice hockey as a game for everyone. A telling slogan - \"In the land of the Giants everyone is equal\" - appears on the cover of the programme sold at each game, as well as on the team's website. </p> <p>The team's name is another masterful piece of marketing.

According to myth, McCool's giant stride created a similar rock formation over the sea in Scotland, where many Northern Ireland Protestants have family links.

      "bodyText": "Twelve-year-old Eamonn stands in the middle of the roaring crowd and beams with delight. He and his friend, Dean, are clearly having the time of their lives. Eamonn and Dean have come to Belfast's new Odyssey Arena to cheer on their heroes, the Belfast Giants ice hockey team. Asked what they like best about this North American sport, the answer comes straight back: \"The fights!\" Eamonn and Dean are among a group of children, of all religions and none, on a visit organised by the local police as part of a community relations project. Before the arrival of the Giants, a cross-community trip to a sporting event here would have been near impossible. Traditional sport in Northern Ireland has been riven by tribal divisions. But the arrival of big league ice hockey has changed all that. At these games, fights are all part of the spectacle, but the violence stays strictly on the ice and the vast crowds of spectators are united in support of their team. The Belfast Giants were formed last year to play in the UK's ice hockey Superleague. The team - whose members are all Canadian, save for a lone American - got off to a sluggish start but rallied in December, when the arena opened and the Giants began playing at home. Support for the team surged as it won nine consecutive home games at the beginning of the year. Attendance has exceeded all expectations, the averagie 6,500 crowd being a near sell-out and making the Giants the best supported team in the league. \"I'm very proud,\" says John, a 40-something dad draped in a Giants shirt and scarf and flanked by his son, Stewart. \"It's only our first season and I'm over the moon to finally have a sport everybody loves. There isn't the tribalism there is in football. With us only having the one team that's for all of Belfast, everybody supports them, and I think that's important.\" At the merchandising kiosk, queues have built as fans snap up goods ranging from rubber pucks to Giants shirts, hats and jackets. Kiosk supervisor Marion Livingstone says: \"Belfast has been crying out for something like this. Soccer's been hijacked on either side of the divide; if you supported one team you were either a Catholic or a Protestant. But it hasn't come into this. It's a sport for all.\" The near-universal popularity of the Giants is not fortuitous, but the result of a carefully orchestrated marketing campaign. The team's communications director, Peter Collins, has worked hard at selling ice hockey as a game for everyone. A telling slogan - \"In the land of the Giants everyone is equal\" - appears on the cover of the programme sold at each game, as well as on the team's website. The team's name is another masterful piece of marketing. It refers to the legendary giant Finn McCool, whose footsteps, so the story goes, created the extraordinary geological formation which is known as the Giant's Causeway - one of Northern Ireland's top tourist attractions. According to myth, McCool's giant stride created a similar rock formation over the sea in Scotland, where many Northern Ireland Protestants have family links.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Global figures on the number of people killed by so-called natural disasters are intriguing. Television coverage, concerns over climate change, accelerated soil erosion and the growth of mega-cities would all suggest that things should be getting worse. But statistics show that natural disasters - drought, floods, hurricanes, volcanic activity - now kill about 100,000 people every year, compared to a regular toll of more than 3m annually in the first 30 years of the 20th century. So is there really a crisis? And, if so, what is it? </p> <p>Nothing, of course, is that simple. Most disasters do not kill instantly. They wreak havoc by destroying livelihoods rather than lives. A graph for the number of people affected - rather than killed - by disasters shows a totally different picture. The figures jump up and down from year to year depending on whether there is a major flood in China or a hurricane in the Americas, but the trend is ever upward. Fifty years ago an average of around 50m people a year were affected, today it is 200m. </p> <p>The massive killers of the early 20th century have been tamed, but at a price. Famine in India or China no longer kills millions. Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal no longer drown hundreds of thousands. Pandemics no longer lay Europe to waste. But while direct loss of life has been averted, millions are now forced to live on marginal lands where chances of escaping the poverty trap disappear every time a flood or storm surge hits. </p> <p>Those who crowd into the mega-cities of the developing world searching for employment, or attempting to escape from persecution and fear, end up in the most disaster-prone parts of the city: on garbage tips, on unstable steep land, in the river valleys regularly hit by flash floods or in malaria-infested marshes. </p> <p>Disasters are first and foremost a major threat to development, and specifically to the development of the poorest and most marginalised people in the world. Disasters seek out the poor and ensure they stay poor. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies annual publication, the World Disasters Report, has highlighted the chronic and rapidly increasing vulnerability of poorer countries to disaster. </p> <p>The relationship between disasters and the environment is evolving and gradually being better understood. It is an insidious one. Take, for example, the flooding along the Mekong river in 2000. These were the worst floods in decades and came on top of high- level flooding in 1999 and 1998. Why? The monsoon season started early and carried on longer than expected. </p> <p>But was this just a statistical anomaly, or evidence of climate change? All the climate models suggest that southeast Asia will see more rainfall and higher river levels as a result of global warming: so what happened in 2000 is likely to become the norm, not the exception. The upper reaches of the Mekong catchment in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam are all subject to extensive logging, much of it illegal and tied up with the funding of paramilitary activity and the opium/ heroin trade. This has led to more rapid runoff and increased flash floods which exacerbate the normal annual flooding. </p> <p>Those on the flood plains who lose their livestock to the waters, watch them recede with a sense of fatalism. They have been driven two notches further down the ladder to inescapable poverty. For them, investment in local disaster mitigation and preparedness is no more than a pipe dream. A more realistic expectation is that they will fell what few standing trees remain, to sell for firewood. Disaster forces people further into poverty and poverty forces the exploitation of the environment. Governments see their development efforts literally being washed away. </p> <p>This vicious cycle can be broken, but only if the governments of disaster-prone countries concede that disasters are a major determinant of development, not just unpredictable dips on the development curve. In Vietnam, for instance, this is beginning to happen: disaster mitigation is now a major political and economic issue. In many places, environmental destruction is a key determinant of the movement of people, whether from the destruction wrought by building new large dams or removing rainforest, or from the reduction in the carrying capacity of the land as pastureland erodes to scrub and wasteland. </p> <p>When people flee and are forced to live in controlled camps, whether as international refugees or internally displaced persons, a whole series of micro-environmental issues come into play.

      "bodyText": "Global figures on the number of people killed by so-called natural disasters are intriguing. Television coverage, concerns over climate change, accelerated soil erosion and the growth of mega-cities would all suggest that things should be getting worse. But statistics show that natural disasters - drought, floods, hurricanes, volcanic activity - now kill about 100,000 people every year, compared to a regular toll of more than 3m annually in the first 30 years of the 20th century. So is there really a crisis? And, if so, what is it? Nothing, of course, is that simple. Most disasters do not kill instantly. They wreak havoc by destroying livelihoods rather than lives. A graph for the number of people affected - rather than killed - by disasters shows a totally different picture. The figures jump up and down from year to year depending on whether there is a major flood in China or a hurricane in the Americas, but the trend is ever upward. Fifty years ago an average of around 50m people a year were affected, today it is 200m. The massive killers of the early 20th century have been tamed, but at a price. Famine in India or China no longer kills millions. Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal no longer drown hundreds of thousands. Pandemics no longer lay Europe to waste. But while direct loss of life has been averted, millions are now forced to live on marginal lands where chances of escaping the poverty trap disappear every time a flood or storm surge hits. Those who crowd into the mega-cities of the developing world searching for employment, or attempting to escape from persecution and fear, end up in the most disaster-prone parts of the city: on garbage tips, on unstable steep land, in the river valleys regularly hit by flash floods or in malaria-infested marshes. Disasters are first and foremost a major threat to development, and specifically to the development of the poorest and most marginalised people in the world. Disasters seek out the poor and ensure they stay poor. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies annual publication, the World Disasters Report, has highlighted the chronic and rapidly increasing vulnerability of poorer countries to disaster. The relationship between disasters and the environment is evolving and gradually being better understood. It is an insidious one. Take, for example, the flooding along the Mekong river in 2000. These were the worst floods in decades and came on top of high- level flooding in 1999 and 1998. Why? The monsoon season started early and carried on longer than expected. But was this just a statistical anomaly, or evidence of climate change? All the climate models suggest that southeast Asia will see more rainfall and higher river levels as a result of global warming: so what happened in 2000 is likely to become the norm, not the exception. The upper reaches of the Mekong catchment in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam are all subject to extensive logging, much of it illegal and tied up with the funding of paramilitary activity and the opium/ heroin trade. This has led to more rapid runoff and increased flash floods which exacerbate the normal annual flooding. Those on the flood plains who lose their livestock to the waters, watch them recede with a sense of fatalism. They have been driven two notches further down the ladder to inescapable poverty. For them, investment in local disaster mitigation and preparedness is no more than a pipe dream. A more realistic expectation is that they will fell what few standing trees remain, to sell for firewood. Disaster forces people further into poverty and poverty forces the exploitation of the environment. Governments see their development efforts literally being washed away. This vicious cycle can be broken, but only if the governments of disaster-prone countries concede that disasters are a major determinant of development, not just unpredictable dips on the development curve. In Vietnam, for instance, this is beginning to happen: disaster mitigation is now a major political and economic issue. In many places, environmental destruction is a key determinant of the movement of people, whether from the destruction wrought by building new large dams or removing rainforest, or from the reduction in the carrying capacity of the land as pastureland erodes to scrub and wasteland. When people flee and are forced to live in controlled camps, whether as international refugees or internally displaced persons, a whole series of micro-environmental issues come into play. In Africa, the destruction of forest cover around refugee camps is a real cause for concern, as is the exploitation of habitat reserves for game. Erecting fences and keeping the refugees hemmed in, however, is no solution. They fell the trees to survive, because they need the wood to sell or for cooking. Refugee camps are mini-cities and yet they are run and financed as though they were temporary roadside shelters. They will continue to pose an environmental threat until host governments and the international community are willing to accept the true cost of displacement generated by the environment, war or famine. Yet disasters sometimes highlight environmental issues which might otherwise go unpublicised. The sheer scale of the destruction and misery often prompts action where years of hidden suffering have failed. After the disaster, there is an opportunity to do things better: to build earthquake-resistant housing; to resettle people away from landslides; to reforest upland catchments; to change agricultural practice. The opportunity is there, but it can easily be missed. The media focus and the relief efforts around disasters are soon over: they come and go in days or weeks. The challenge for aid agencies and community groups is to keep the government focused on the issues long enough to change economic policy. In many ways, this is the real relief effort, not the delivery of shelter and food. Relief from floods next year and the year after will not come from emergency deliveries. It will come from changed agricultural practice, access to credit, more integrated landuse planning and a whole host of issues which require a sustained will to improve the lives of the most vulnerable.

      "body": "<p>\"It's so cold on the streets and so frightening,\" says Marie, a 20-year-old student who ran away from a Birmingham care home just before she was 16. She felt that she had no choice but to run away because the stepfather who had sexually abused her as a child, which led to her going into care in the first place, kept following her. He would appear and sit next to her as she sat on the bus to school, and hang around the care home. </p> <p>\"When I was 12 he was jailed for the abuse for a while, but it was all over the papers and everyone knew what he had done to me,\" she says. \"In the end, I couldn't stand it and felt the only thing I could do was run away.\" </p> <p>She finished her GCSEs, took a job washing up in a restaurant for three weeks to save enough money for a train ticket to London, and then ran. </p> <p>\"The worst thing was that no one would listen to me,\" she recalls. \"I was scared and nervous when I got on the train, but I felt I couldn't go back to the situation I had left behind. Kids will only run away if the situation they are in is so bad that living on the streets seems like a better option. Something has got to be really wrong to make a young person do a thing like that.\" </p> <p>Marie was so terrified when she arrived at Euston station that she simply walked the streets for three days - too frightened of what might happen if she lay down and closed her eyes. \"I felt so alone in the world,\" she says. \"Nobody in my care home bothered to report me missing. The streets are full of homeless young people crying out for love.\" </p> <p>Marie was one of an estimated 129,000 young people who run away each year. The commonest reasons for children taking flight include desperation at not being listened to, rows with parents over the amount of freedom they are allowed, bullying at school, and drug problems or abuse at home. </p> <p>A new paper from the Social Exclusion Unit, Consultation on Young Runaways, highlights the problem and puts a variety of solutions to the problem out to consultation. By the age of 16, one in nine children will have run away for at least one night, with a quarter of those ending up sleeping rough. Some have to survive through begging, stealing or prostitution, and many are sexually abused on the streets. </p> <p>While children like Marie, who have been in care, make up a large proportion of runaways (approximately four in 10), the report finds that 21% are fleeing stepfamilies, and 13% one-parent families, compared to 7% who live with both birth parents. But, contrary to stereotype, poverty was found not to be a significant factor leading to young people running away: those from leafy suburbs are just as likely to flee as those from deprived inner-city areas. The majority of runaways are aged between 13 and 16 and are more likely to be girls than boys (although boys tend to run away earlier and more often). It is not only a problem of troubled adolescence: an estimated 18,000 children under 11 also run away each year, of whom about a third are under eight. Shockingly, a further 18,000 children a year are thrown out by their parents. The report also notes that the longer runaways are away, the more vulnerable they become. </p> <p>There is no national network of services in place, so emergency organisations like Childline find it very hard to refer children who phone in a crisis to appropriate local services. The report proposes a series of measures both to prevent young people from running away in the first place, and to provide decent support services when they do. </p> <p>Plans include an interview for each young person who has run away to identify the reasons for fleeing, and to try to tackle them rather than just dumping the children back in the situation from which they have fled; a network of refuges so that young people are not forced to live rough; and the establishment of a named person in each area to co-ordinate services for runaways. </p> <p>Chris, now 20, ran away from numerous care placements about 20 times. He believes that refuges are essential, but also that fundamental changes in the care system are necessary. \"I was frightened on the streets,\" he recalls, \"but I also felt free. I shoplifted to survive. I received no support in care. Nobody listened and I was bullied. For me, living on the streets was better than that.\" </p> <p>Much of the data in the government's new report comes from research carried out by the Children's Society, which has been working with young runaways for the past 20 years. The charity's Penny Dean welcomed the report, but is urging the government to implement some of the proposals - such as providing children with interviews - right away rather than await the outcome of the three-month consultation process. A Social Exclusion Unit spokesman has responded that this would not be possible. </p> <p>\"I really hope the government won't delay over this,\" says Dean. \"Young runaways are a very hard to reach group who need a lot of support. A lot of these young people view statutory agencies with mistrust, and we need a mechanism to draw together expertise from the voluntary sector to deliver the services young people want.\" </p> <p>She condemns the lack of funding for refuges - Centrepoint in London is the only one in Britain - and argues that, although the concept of children's refuges was established in the 1989 Children Act, the money to run them has not been forthcoming from the government. Without such refuges, there is no safety net to protect children from the dangers of the streets. Besides the government recommendations, the Children's Society is calling for more early intervention to prevent running away; support and mediation for parents and children where families have divorced, separated or reformed, and more ethnically sensitive services. </p> <p>Dorit Braun, of Parentline Plus, expresses concern about the number of children who run away from stepfamilies. Jealousy of a parent's new partner can fuel conflict between children and adults in stepfamilies, she says. \"Many children do adjust well, but a small minority don't. The young people and the adults in a stepfamily need to be given time to understand each other. The dynamics of a stepfamily are much more complex than those in an intact family, and stepparents can be viewed by children as interfering and making a difficult situation worse.\" </p> <p>The government has highlighted a small project in Gloucester called Astra (Alternative Solutions to Running Away), which employs just three part-time workers, as a model of good practice.

      "bodyText": "\"It's so cold on the streets and so frightening,\" says Marie, a 20-year-old student who ran away from a Birmingham care home just before she was 16. She felt that she had no choice but to run away because the stepfather who had sexually abused her as a child, which led to her going into care in the first place, kept following her. He would appear and sit next to her as she sat on the bus to school, and hang around the care home. \"When I was 12 he was jailed for the abuse for a while, but it was all over the papers and everyone knew what he had done to me,\" she says. \"In the end, I couldn't stand it and felt the only thing I could do was run away.\" She finished her GCSEs, took a job washing up in a restaurant for three weeks to save enough money for a train ticket to London, and then ran. \"The worst thing was that no one would listen to me,\" she recalls. \"I was scared and nervous when I got on the train, but I felt I couldn't go back to the situation I had left behind. Kids will only run away if the situation they are in is so bad that living on the streets seems like a better option. Something has got to be really wrong to make a young person do a thing like that.\" Marie was so terrified when she arrived at Euston station that she simply walked the streets for three days - too frightened of what might happen if she lay down and closed her eyes. \"I felt so alone in the world,\" she says. \"Nobody in my care home bothered to report me missing. The streets are full of homeless young people crying out for love.\" Marie was one of an estimated 129,000 young people who run away each year. The commonest reasons for children taking flight include desperation at not being listened to, rows with parents over the amount of freedom they are allowed, bullying at school, and drug problems or abuse at home. A new paper from the Social Exclusion Unit, Consultation on Young Runaways, highlights the problem and puts a variety of solutions to the problem out to consultation. By the age of 16, one in nine children will have run away for at least one night, with a quarter of those ending up sleeping rough. Some have to survive through begging, stealing or prostitution, and many are sexually abused on the streets. While children like Marie, who have been in care, make up a large proportion of runaways (approximately four in 10), the report finds that 21% are fleeing stepfamilies, and 13% one-parent families, compared to 7% who live with both birth parents. But, contrary to stereotype, poverty was found not to be a significant factor leading to young people running away: those from leafy suburbs are just as likely to flee as those from deprived inner-city areas. The majority of runaways are aged between 13 and 16 and are more likely to be girls than boys (although boys tend to run away earlier and more often). It is not only a problem of troubled adolescence: an estimated 18,000 children under 11 also run away each year, of whom about a third are under eight. Shockingly, a further 18,000 children a year are thrown out by their parents. The report also notes that the longer runaways are away, the more vulnerable they become. There is no national network of services in place, so emergency organisations like Childline find it very hard to refer children who phone in a crisis to appropriate local services. The report proposes a series of measures both to prevent young people from running away in the first place, and to provide decent support services when they do. Plans include an interview for each young person who has run away to identify the reasons for fleeing, and to try to tackle them rather than just dumping the children back in the situation from which they have fled; a network of refuges so that young people are not forced to live rough; and the establishment of a named person in each area to co-ordinate services for runaways. Chris, now 20, ran away from numerous care placements about 20 times. He believes that refuges are essential, but also that fundamental changes in the care system are necessary. \"I was frightened on the streets,\" he recalls, \"but I also felt free. I shoplifted to survive. I received no support in care. Nobody listened and I was bullied. For me, living on the streets was better than that.\" Much of the data in the government's new report comes from research carried out by the Children's Society, which has been working with young runaways for the past 20 years. The charity's Penny Dean welcomed the report, but is urging the government to implement some of the proposals - such as providing children with interviews - right away rather than await the outcome of the three-month consultation process. A Social Exclusion Unit spokesman has responded that this would not be possible. \"I really hope the government won't delay over this,\" says Dean. \"Young runaways are a very hard to reach group who need a lot of support. A lot of these young people view statutory agencies with mistrust, and we need a mechanism to draw together expertise from the voluntary sector to deliver the services young people want.\" She condemns the lack of funding for refuges - Centrepoint in London is the only one in Britain - and argues that, although the concept of children's refuges was established in the 1989 Children Act, the money to run them has not been forthcoming from the government. Without such refuges, there is no safety net to protect children from the dangers of the streets. Besides the government recommendations, the Children's Society is calling for more early intervention to prevent running away; support and mediation for parents and children where families have divorced, separated or reformed, and more ethnically sensitive services. Dorit Braun, of Parentline Plus, expresses concern about the number of children who run away from stepfamilies. Jealousy of a parent's new partner can fuel conflict between children and adults in stepfamilies, she says. \"Many children do adjust well, but a small minority don't. The young people and the adults in a stepfamily need to be given time to understand each other. The dynamics of a stepfamily are much more complex than those in an intact family, and stepparents can be viewed by children as interfering and making a difficult situation worse.\" The government has highlighted a small project in Gloucester called Astra (Alternative Solutions to Running Away), which employs just three part-time workers, as a model of good practice. The project works with young people who have run away to prevent recurrences. Staff listen to young people's concerns and then try to work with them, their parents and other agencies (such as schools and social services) to find solutions with which both the young people and their parents or carers are happy. Police estimate that the project has reduced the number of repeat runaways by 61%. One former runaway, Sally, 14, says the project has helped her resolve a difficult situation with her mother: \"My mum didn't like my friends, the way I dressed or the fact that I wore make-up, and she didn't like me going out. One day, I just didn't go home from school. I was scared because I didn't know where I could go. In the end, I stayed at a friend's house. Astra talked to my mum and talked to me. Now she gives me a bit more freedom, I understand her better and she understands me better.\" Now that Marie is settled in London, studying for a university degree and living in a flat that a Children's Society-supported tenancy project helped to secure for her, the days of trudging around the capital's West End with nowhere to go seem very far off. \"I love my home,\" she says. \"I've got my own front room, my own bedroom, a cat, friends and a normal life. I don't ever want to go through what I went through again. And if young people like me had more rights, they wouldn't have to either.\"",

But as the government's \"best value\" initiative, introduced to transform town hall services across the country, next week reaches its first anniversary, those charged with monitoring the new initiative are hardly in a mood to party. </p> <p>A report from the audit commission's best value inspection service earlier this month called for councils to demonstrate a \"step-change in performance\" in year two of the new regime. Councils were accused of lacking ambition in what they could achieve with best value. They were still said to be shying away from competition and \"making a priority of keeping services in-house\". And some council officers were found to be showing signs of a \"compliance mentality\", concerned more with satisfying inspectors than with ramping up service levels. </p> <p>But it is not all bad. Wendy Thomson, the commission's director of inspection, says the first year has produced a \"mixed story\". The need for greater pace and real improvements does not mean the commission is completely dissatisfied with progress. \"What we are incredibly pleased with is that we do have, for the first time, a comprehensive performance management system,\" she insists. \"That has never been there before. And actually there is an incredibly high degree of understanding and knowledge of it.\" </p> <p>Thomson points to earlier initiatives such as best value's predecessor, compulsory competitive tendering. \"It took a long time before people knew what CCT was,\" she says. In comparison, she argues, best value has almost become part of everyday language, at least inside town halls. Add to this the successful publication of 410 best value performance plans on time last March, which she describes as an \"humongous enterprise\", and councils can feel some sense of achievement. </p> <p>These successes are unlikely to cut much ice with the public or with ministers, impatient to see their policies delivering the transformation they promised. But Thomson says visible proof of the impact of best value on public services will take time. </p> <p>Under best value, councils have to review all their services over a five year period. That means that councils will, on average, review just 20% of their services each year. It will take well over two years before major changes can be implemented and any movement in performance can be measured. And this is just one-fifth of a council's output. </p> <p>Thomson says that there needs to be recognition that transformational change takes time. \"You need to have patience,\" she says. \"You just have to stick with it.\" </p> <p>Inspectors usually go in when councils have completed a best value review. With more than 600 inspections planned for the first year and just over 60 reports published by mid-March (although reports are now appearing almost daily), it is undoubtedly early days to be making sweeping judgments about best value. But it is already clear that there is substantial room for improvement. Some 28 services have been assessed as one-star, or \"fair\", and a further 32 have been given a two-star, or \"good\", rating. Just three councils have won three-star \"excellent\" ratings, and one authority, Stockport, has received a no-star \"poor\" rating for its housing allocations service. </p> <p>But it is the inspectors' second judgment, on a council's likelihood to improve, that is being watched most avidly. A two-star service that is unlikely to improve may well be seen as more problematic than a \"fair\" service where improvement is a good bet. And, alarmingly, about half the councils inspected so far were assessed either as not being in a position to improve or as unlikely to improve. </p> <p>Although further no-star ratings are believed to be lurking in the wings, Thomson dismisses as a \"conspiracy theory\" the suggestion that the commission is sitting on the worst reports. However, a number of damning reports are expected over the coming weeks - unless they fall foul of the purdah that will be imposed if a May general election is called. </p> <p>But can the inspection service point to any clear cases where improvements are being made as a result of the efforts of inspectors, and not just because of the best value review process? Thomson points out that inspectors are playing different roles in different places. But she says it is the \"complacent middle\" where they are having most impact. \"There are some districts in this country that have never had any external challenge at all,\" she says. \"It is a shock for them to have people come in and question [their practices].\" </p> <p>According to Thomson, Stockport provides a good example of a fundamental difference made by the inspection service. The inspectors' assessment of the housing allocation service was at odds with the council's own best value review. \"[The] Stockport [report] described in pretty horrific detail a council doing terribly badly,\" she says. It produced a list of weaknesses requiring \"urgent\" attention, including not having a published summary of its allocations policy and failing to implement the commission for racial equality's code of practice for rented housing. Thomson's point is that the self-review failed and, without the inspectors' involvement, many of the problems would not now be being addressed. </p> <p>The council's dire assessment was tempered by the inspectors' conclusion that the service would probably improve, partly because the council moved swiftly following an early preview of the report to put in place a revised action plan to address the exposed weaknesses. </p> <p>Thomson insists that inspectors do not revel in finding poor performance. \"We are not interested in getting publicity for kicking people,\" she says. \"We're interested in getting change. [Stockport] convinced us that they were going to do something and introduce radical change. That is more important than me getting publicity on the Today programme. Naming and shaming is pretty easy to get publicity for, but it doesn't actually change very much.\" </p> <p>Many councils remain unconvinced of the need for such rigorous inspection, seeing it as a further example of central government's lack of trust in town halls. But it is the inspectors' powers to recommend intervention and bring in a third party to run a failing service that authorities find alarming. </p> <p>Thomson, however, seems keen to avoid the inevitable legal wrangles that would follow any such recommendation. \"We are erring on getting people's consent,\" she says. \"We believe that if you've made the case for change, and they've accepted it, you get a lot more action that way than if you write a command-and-control note.\" </p> <p>This reluctance to use its most extreme weapon - recommending intervention - is best demonstrated in the inspection service's response to the problems facing Hackney, the east London borough torn apart by severe financial problems and hamstrung by political in-fighting. A special report last November, triggered by the district auditor's concerns over the borough's best value performance plan, concluded that the council could not improve its governance arrangements alone - although it recommended that accountability for the running of the council should remain with elected councillors and officers.

      "byline": "Clare Tomlinson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>After a friendly kickabout at Villa Park and, despite an agonising finale, three valuable points when things got serious at Anfield, we are beginning to get a sense of our new Swedish bride. Sven-Goran Eriksson will be re-examined every time he picks a team, but right now the clear impression is that we want this foreign marriage to work. </p> <p>Eriksson is so different from previous incumbents. Where Kevin Keegan was volatile and hyper, Eriksson is laid-back and relaxed. Where Glenn Hoddle was minutely interested in every element of the itinerary, Eriksson is content to leave such details to his administration staff. Where Terry Venables took direct charge of training sessions, Eriksson stands to the side, observing. </p> <p>Where previous coaches railed against international week's national pastime, \"Guess the England team\", Eriksson merely smiles and shrugs off direct questions. But so far no one has trumpeted his line-up. </p> <p>He rarely reads the newspapers and when he does his choice is broadsheet rather than tabloid. Paranoid he is not. He doesn't care what went before or how his predecessors coped. </p> <p>He gives nothing away. Asked to describe his style of management, he directs you to ask the players. When told they think he is studious and serene, he smiles - and changes the subject. </p> <p>Within the England camp this smile is a regular feature of life. I witnessed it myself last week as I enjoyed a cup of tea at the squad's Cheshire HQ with my former colleagues from the FA's media department. He walks about the hotel, beaming and relaxed, his disposition approachable and informal. </p> <p>There are no mood swings with Eriksson. The players know where they stand and their respect for him is unmistakable. To a man, they praise his ability to communicate and are clearly enjoying the atmosphere of calm he engenders. </p> <p>And curiously, this tranquillity seems also to pervade the media battalions. There has been a quiet acceptance of reduced access to the coach and a resigned recognition that, when he does give a press conference, little new will be forthcoming. </p> <p>As with many of his predecessors, dealing with the media is not a part of the job Eriksson relishes. After my 10-minute, one-on-one interview for Sky Sports pre-Finland - the first of his media commitments that day - he looked genuinely shocked when I suggested that he still had well over an hour of questioning to face. </p> <p>Yet he loves the interest that the game inspires in this country. He thrives on our passion for football in the same way as the Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. </p> <p>When he first came to England, Ars\u00e8ne constantly exhorted me, as his press officer, to reduce his media commitments, but was fascinated by the nation's insatiable appetite for the sport. Mostly because it matched his own. When managing Monaco, he would come over here at Christmas just to see some matches and escape the French league's winter break. </p> <p>And just as Wenger took stock of the situation at Highbury before gradually imposing his own ideas and personality, Eriksson too has been observing and evaluating before making adjustments. </p> <p>Ultimately Eriksson's tenure as England coach will be judged in the same way as all his predecessors. Results are everything, performances a bonus which make the ride easier. </p> <p>Yet after mere months here and only two games in charge, there is a feeling of some optimism regarding his selection policies. He is determined that players should be deployed in positions familiar to them; a simple strategy perhaps, but one that had previously been mislaid. </p> <p>Intriguingly, it appears that we can look forward to some continuity. Had Steven Gerrard not succumbed to the inevitable, there was even the possibility that we might have seen an unchanged side in Albania tonight. But then injuries have always been the bane of the England coach's life and luck is perhaps as crucial a factor as judgment. </p> <p>By all accounts the Albanians were unlucky not to earn a draw in Germany at the weekend.

      "bodyText": "After a friendly kickabout at Villa Park and, despite an agonising finale, three valuable points when things got serious at Anfield, we are beginning to get a sense of our new Swedish bride. Sven-Goran Eriksson will be re-examined every time he picks a team, but right now the clear impression is that we want this foreign marriage to work. Eriksson is so different from previous incumbents. Where Kevin Keegan was volatile and hyper, Eriksson is laid-back and relaxed. Where Glenn Hoddle was minutely interested in every element of the itinerary, Eriksson is content to leave such details to his administration staff. Where Terry Venables took direct charge of training sessions, Eriksson stands to the side, observing. Where previous coaches railed against international week's national pastime, \"Guess the England team\", Eriksson merely smiles and shrugs off direct questions. But so far no one has trumpeted his line-up. He rarely reads the newspapers and when he does his choice is broadsheet rather than tabloid. Paranoid he is not. He doesn't care what went before or how his predecessors coped. He gives nothing away. Asked to describe his style of management, he directs you to ask the players. When told they think he is studious and serene, he smiles - and changes the subject. Within the England camp this smile is a regular feature of life. I witnessed it myself last week as I enjoyed a cup of tea at the squad's Cheshire HQ with my former colleagues from the FA's media department. He walks about the hotel, beaming and relaxed, his disposition approachable and informal. There are no mood swings with Eriksson. The players know where they stand and their respect for him is unmistakable. To a man, they praise his ability to communicate and are clearly enjoying the atmosphere of calm he engenders. And curiously, this tranquillity seems also to pervade the media battalions. There has been a quiet acceptance of reduced access to the coach and a resigned recognition that, when he does give a press conference, little new will be forthcoming. As with many of his predecessors, dealing with the media is not a part of the job Eriksson relishes. After my 10-minute, one-on-one interview for Sky Sports pre-Finland - the first of his media commitments that day - he looked genuinely shocked when I suggested that he still had well over an hour of questioning to face. Yet he loves the interest that the game inspires in this country. He thrives on our passion for football in the same way as the Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. When he first came to England, Ars\u00e8ne constantly exhorted me, as his press officer, to reduce his media commitments, but was fascinated by the nation's insatiable appetite for the sport. Mostly because it matched his own. When managing Monaco, he would come over here at Christmas just to see some matches and escape the French league's winter break. And just as Wenger took stock of the situation at Highbury before gradually imposing his own ideas and personality, Eriksson too has been observing and evaluating before making adjustments. Ultimately Eriksson's tenure as England coach will be judged in the same way as all his predecessors. Results are everything, performances a bonus which make the ride easier. Yet after mere months here and only two games in charge, there is a feeling of some optimism regarding his selection policies. He is determined that players should be deployed in positions familiar to them; a simple strategy perhaps, but one that had previously been mislaid. Intriguingly, it appears that we can look forward to some continuity. Had Steven Gerrard not succumbed to the inevitable, there was even the possibility that we might have seen an unchanged side in Albania tonight. But then injuries have always been the bane of the England coach's life and luck is perhaps as crucial a factor as judgment. By all accounts the Albanians were unlucky not to earn a draw in Germany at the weekend. Yet England expects nothing less than three more qualifying points. Anything short of that would not just end Eriksson's honeymoon, it might even put the Swede's serenity to the test.

Comes out to Scholes who fires it into Heskey at the far post; Strakosha gets a fingertip to it to deny Heskey. 52 Shocking behaviour by the linesman when England are denied a corner and almost a throw-in before the ref steps in. 53 England corner, Albania clear. 55 Hairy moment for Engalnd when Vata fires in from distance and Seaman has trouble holding the ball after a deflection. 57 Kola breaks and looks for Bushi on the right as Albania pressure again. 58 Still Albania dictating the pace of the game as Ferdinand forces things wide for a corner. Brown clears, Beckham finds Ashley Cole up on the right for the Arsenal player to loop it over the top for Owen to chase - too far. 81 England denied a penalty after Cipi crashes into Butt and flattens him in the box. 63 Albania running around with increasing confidence as Bushi has a crack from distance. 65 England corner, Beckham from the left, Strakosha spills before claiming. 67 Expect headlines filled with the words \"false dawn\" should England fail to improve on their display so far. 69 Beckham gets into area but is stopped in his tracks. The ball comes to Andy Cole on the by-line and he fires it across goal for Strakosha to deny Heskey on the far post. 73 Increasingly desperate for England as Albania push up again. 74 GOAL: Albania 0 - 1 England Butt plays Owen through into the area for the Liverpool player to jab past Strakosha with his right foot. About time. 76 A great ball in by Beckham; all it needed was a touch by Andy Cole at the far post. Did it get it? Did it heck. 78 Albania's second corner of the night, Beckham clears. 79 Heskey tries to feed Andy Cole through on goal by Cifi cuts out the chance. 80 Lala causes a momentary panic in the England area when England make a mess of clearing the ball. 82 Substitution Muka on for Kola. Booking Neville for time-wasting, apparently while waiting for Albania to complete the substitution. 84 Substitution Sheringham on for Owen. 85 GOAL: Albania 0 - 2 England Scholes plays in Andy Cole on the left of the area. Cole drifts along the by-line and lays it back for Scholes to shoot into the roof of the net from close range. 87 Booking Andy Cole Substitution Rraklli on for Fakaj. 90 Five minutes extra to play. And what happens GOAL: Albania 1 - 2 England Indecision by Ferdinand allows Rraklli to get a late consolation to leave England hanging on for the dying moments. And if that wasn't enough, Rraklli finds the net again in the next minute only to be ruled offside. And then, would you believe it... GOAL: Albania 1 - 3 England. Andy Cole finally breaks his duck when he puts away England's third. Full-time. Fraught for England at the end, and by no means an easy or pretty game, but it's the points that count.",
