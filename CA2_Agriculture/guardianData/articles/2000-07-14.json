Unlike larger clubs there are no state-of-the-art facilities, no high-tech gym and no army of staff catering to the boys' every need. </p> <p>But though it does not look special, Millwall's youth academy is among the best in the land. The much-hyped teenage striker Cherno Samba and fellow local boy Goma Lambu are in the England Under-16 squad to play Brazil at the Stadium of Light tomorrow, and another Millwall prospect, Charlie Hearn, played in the England Under-18 side at the age of 16. </p> <p>Whereas Arsenal and Chelsea are condemned for preventing their young talent from developing, at Millwall the boys are encouraged to progress to the first team when they are ready.

      "bodyText": "At first glance Millwall's youth academy in south London looks nothing out of the ordinary. Unlike larger clubs there are no state-of-the-art facilities, no high-tech gym and no army of staff catering to the boys' every need. But though it does not look special, Millwall's youth academy is among the best in the land. The much-hyped teenage striker Cherno Samba and fellow local boy Goma Lambu are in the England Under-16 squad to play Brazil at the Stadium of Light tomorrow, and another Millwall prospect, Charlie Hearn, played in the England Under-18 side at the age of 16. Whereas Arsenal and Chelsea are condemned for preventing their young talent from developing, at Millwall the boys are encouraged to progress to the first team when they are ready. According to the youth director Nicky Milo, \"if they're good enough then they're in the team, it's as simple as that\". Milo believes the secret of Millwall's success lies in prioritising coaching above all else. \"The main problem with the game in England is the lack of qualified coaches. It's not that we lack talent but that we don't teach these boys how to think about the game. You could be great on the ball but you won't make it if you don't understand how to use that talent.

The FA technical director Howard Wilkinson was moved to condemn the Chelsea chairman Ken Bates's recent claims that there weren't enough good English players, saying: \"It does seem a paradox to me that you [Chelsea] should invest heavily in an academy when you've decided the kids you're producing aren't going to be good enough anyway.\" When the teenager Jay Bothroyd joined Coventry from Arsenal this week for \u00a31m he hit out at his former employers. \"Arsenal want to buy success,\" he said. \"The manager's job is always on the line, he needs success now. If a few young players come through that's a bonus but they're not really interested in youth.\" To be fair to Arsenal, Bothroyd's claims were slightly specious given that Arsenal won the FA Youth Cup. Nor has all their young English talent leaked away: the promising left-back Ashley Cole is expected to step up into the first team next season. But behind Bothroyd's bluster lies a more pertinent truth: young players who succeed at academy level often find their path to the first team blocked by an established foreign star.

      "body": "<p>It is one of football's more eccentric rituals. Every weekday, Isa\u00edas Ambr\u00f3sio, an engaging 73-year-old Brazilian, travels to the Maracan\u00e3 stadium in Rio de Janeiro where he relives a football match that happened 50 years ago. </p> <p>He stands overlooking the pitch, sweating in morning sun, retelling the moments when Brazil lost the 1950 World Cup final to Uruguay. \"On the 33rd minute, with only 12 minutes remaining,\" he narrates with the dramatic intensity of a radio commentator, \"Gigghia takes the ball from the middle of the pitch.\" He turns around and points at the grass, where a few men are laying turf. \"And he goes and goes and goes and\" . . . silence. He pauses and takes a breath. Then, in a sombre tone, slowly, reluctantly, inevitably: \"Goal for the Uruguayans.\" </p> <p>Tomorrow is the 50th anniversary of the most famous defeat in the history of Brazilian football, the day that the world's most gifted side unexpectedly lost 2-1 at home to a young team from their tiny southern neighbour. An estimated 200,000 spectators - the largest crowd at any football match - stood witness. Of that number, all but 280 were cheering for the \"invincible\" hosts. It was such a grandiose humiliation that, even now, the wounds have not healed. </p> <p>Never mind that Brazil became world champions eight years later, in Sweden; and again four years after that, in Chile, in 1970 with the legendary team that included Pel\u00e9, Gerson, Jairzinho and Rivellino; and again in the United States in 1994. The final of July 16, 1950, still weighs heavily on the Brazilian soul. </p> <p>A football match has probably never had such a strong and enduring impact on the emotional life of a nation. \"For me, the game is still in the present. The story is not over,\" laments Isa\u00edas Ambr\u00f3sio, whose daily commentaries are part of an expanding universe of idiosyncratic comings to term with defeat. In Brazil, the match has inspired more literature than any other sporting event. Nelson Rodrigues, the country's most celebrated playwright, wrote in 1966 that: \"Everywhere has its irremediable national catastrophe, something like a Hiroshima. Our catastrophe, our Hiroshima, was the defeat by Uruguay in 1950.\" </p> <p>This sounds a ludicrous exaggeration but he was very serious, and many Brazilians would still agree. Three books have been published to coincide with the 50th anniversary analysing the defeat and its consequences for the Brazilian psyche. </p> <p>\"I was motionless, sitting on a concrete step, watching the sun shine obliquely on the pitch, hearing the silence of the crowd, a silence not even broken by the sobs, in brutal gasps, of the collective orphaning,\" grieves the novelist Carlos Heitor Cony, a member of the prestigious Brazilian Academy of Letters. \"Survivors of that cruel afternoon believed they would never again be happy. What happened on July 16 1950 deserves a collective monument, like the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. These are the things that build nations, a people drenched in their own pain.\" </p> <p>A film was even made about the match. In Barbosa - made by the award-winning Jorge Furtado - the protagonist goes back in time to warn goalkeeper Moacyr Barbosa that Gigghia is going to shoot to the bottom left corner of his goal. In the words of the narrator, the goal had to be annulled because the \"defeat stuck like a sign of destiny, proof that in this country nothing ever works out\". </p> <p>Barbosa became the scapegoat, the personification of the national trauma. Even though he was unanimously voted best goalkeeper of the 1950 World Cup by journalists, in the aftermath he became the country's whipping boy in a way that was shameful by any standards. He told a documentary that the saddest moment was 20 years after the match when he was spotted by a woman in a shop. \"Look at him,\" she said to her son, \"He is the man that made all of Brazil cry.\" </p> <p>One sportswriter wrote that Barbosa was victim of the greatest injustice in footballing history. Even his colleagues shunned him. When, in 1993, he went to visit the Brazilian squad's training camp he wasn't allowed in for fear he would bring them bad luck. Shortly before he died, almost penniless, last April, he said: \" Under Brazilian law the maximum sentence is 30 years. But my imprisonment has been for 50.\" </p> <p>The goalkeeper is the subject of the recently-published Barbosa, A Goal Is Fifty Years Old, by Roberto Muylaert, one of Brazil's most distinguished journalists. In it he reveals a sublimely bizarre fact that gives the whole tale another surreal twist. In 1963 Barbosa invited friends to a barbecue at his home. Only when the guests arrived did they realise why. The fire was flaming unusually high and was hissing from burning paint. Barbosa wasn't using ordinary wood: he was burning goalposts. The Maracan\u00e3's \"fateful\" goalposts were being reduced to ashes by the man whose life had been branded by them. Muylaert describes the bonfire as a \"liturgy of purification\". Barbosa deliriously compared himself to a cannibal: \"That well-seasoned steak with onion and vinegar sauce that I ate could symbolise Gigghia's leg pumping with the camphor of the game.\" </p> <p>But why was the 1950 World Cup Final much more than a game of football? First, it was the only time Brazil has ever hosted a soccer world cup. The Maracan\u00e3, built for the tournament, was the world's largest stadium - a world-champion stadium built for a world-champion team. It was the embodiment in concrete of Brazil's footballing sovereignty. </p> <p>Second, it was a study in sporting hubris. Brazil had demolished Sweden 7-1 and Spain 6-1 in the final round. Only a draw was needed against the unfancied Uruguayans. Brazil's victory was considered such a fait accompli that the Rio mayor announced triumphantly on the loudspeaker system shortly before the kickoff: \"You, players, who in less than a few hours will be hailed as champions by your compatriots. You, who I already salute as victors.\" </p> <p>According to Roberto Muylaert, victory was supposed to signal \"the emergence of a renewed and respected nation that would finally show the planet the strength, quality and discipline of a first world country\". Instead, it reinforced a perennial feeling of inferiority. </p> <p>The match set up the contradictory mentality that has underlined Brazilian support in the following half-century. For Brazil, the opposition is irrelevent. Brazil is always playing against itself, against its own demons, against the ghosts of 1950. The anthropologist Roberto DaMatta, in a paper submitted to the Ibero American Studies Centre, describes in serious academic tones that the defeat was \"possibly the biggest tragedy in contemporary Brazilian history\". He writes: \"The defeat brought a united vision of the loss of a historic opportunity. It happened at the beginning of a decade in which Brazil was looking to assert itself as a nation that had a great destiny to fulfil. The result was a tireless search for explications and blame.\" </p> <p>In his book, Anatomy of a Defeat, Paulo Perdig\u00e3o says: \"Of all the historical examples of national crises, the World Cup of 1950 is the most beautiful and most glorified.It is a Waterloo of the tropics and its history our G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung. The defeat transformed a normal fact into an exceptional narrative: it is a fabulous myth that has been preserved and even grown in the public imagination.\" </p> <p>One reason that it has stayed in the collective consciousness is that it was the last event in Brazil to happen before television, which arrived two months later, in September 1950. The 200,000 who saw the game were up 10% of the population of Rio. Almost everyone in Rio has a family member - often a living one - who was there. The whole city feels as if it personally witnessed the catastrophe. </p> <p>Gigghia's goal was caught on film. The few seconds that show the Uruguayan's run, the shot, Barbosa's dive and then the goalkeeper slowly picking himself up have become Brazil's equivalent of the Zapruder footage of John Kennedy's assassination - endlessly analysed, somehow timeless, and showing a moment that defines a nation's history. The goal and the gunshot that killed Kennedy, both have, believes Muylaert, \"The same drama, the same movement, rhythm, the same precision of an inexorable trajectory'.\" </p> <p>One of the immediate consequences of the defeat was the scrapping of the white shirts that had until then been the Brazilian strip. In their place were introduced the yellow tops that have become the world's most recognisable - and romantic - footballing fashion brand. Carlos Heitor Cony believes something else was lost. \"In 1950 we lost that innocence, that excitement that we inherited from the Indians when they saw the [Portuguese] ships approaching [in 1500]. Maybe it was best that way. Painfully, accidentally, we became adults.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the greatest irony is that the game is not remembered with quite such importance by the victorious Uruguayans - who have never won a World Cup since, or even come close. On Monday at the Maracan\u00e3 I asked a Uruguayan tour guide, Juan Jos\u00e9 Olivera, how his compatriots feel about Brazil's obsession with the defeat. \"Young Uruguayans don't really care about the past,\" he said. \"They don't talk about the 1950 World Cup. It happened too long ago.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Alex Bellos's book on Brazilian football will be published by Bloomsbury in 2002.</p>",

The anthropologist Roberto DaMatta, in a paper submitted to the Ibero American Studies Centre, describes in serious academic tones that the defeat was \"possibly the biggest tragedy in contemporary Brazilian history\". He writes: \"The defeat brought a united vision of the loss of a historic opportunity. It happened at the beginning of a decade in which Brazil was looking to assert itself as a nation that had a great destiny to fulfil. The result was a tireless search for explications and blame.\" In his book, Anatomy of a Defeat, Paulo Perdig\u00e3o says: \"Of all the historical examples of national crises, the World Cup of 1950 is the most beautiful and most glorified.It is a Waterloo of the tropics and its history our G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung. The defeat transformed a normal fact into an exceptional narrative: it is a fabulous myth that has been preserved and even grown in the public imagination.\" One reason that it has stayed in the collective consciousness is that it was the last event in Brazil to happen before television, which arrived two months later, in September 1950. The 200,000 who saw the game were up 10% of the population of Rio. Almost everyone in Rio has a family member - often a living one - who was there. The whole city feels as if it personally witnessed the catastrophe. Gigghia's goal was caught on film. The few seconds that show the Uruguayan's run, the shot, Barbosa's dive and then the goalkeeper slowly picking himself up have become Brazil's equivalent of the Zapruder footage of John Kennedy's assassination - endlessly analysed, somehow timeless, and showing a moment that defines a nation's history. The goal and the gunshot that killed Kennedy, both have, believes Muylaert, \"The same drama, the same movement, rhythm, the same precision of an inexorable trajectory'.\" One of the immediate consequences of the defeat was the scrapping of the white shirts that had until then been the Brazilian strip. In their place were introduced the yellow tops that have become the world's most recognisable - and romantic - footballing fashion brand. Carlos Heitor Cony believes something else was lost. \"In 1950 we lost that innocence, that excitement that we inherited from the Indians when they saw the [Portuguese] ships approaching [in 1500]. Maybe it was best that way. Painfully, accidentally, we became adults.\" Perhaps the greatest irony is that the game is not remembered with quite such importance by the victorious Uruguayans - who have never won a World Cup since, or even come close. On Monday at the Maracan\u00e3 I asked a Uruguayan tour guide, Juan Jos\u00e9 Olivera, how his compatriots feel about Brazil's obsession with the defeat. \"Young Uruguayans don't really care about the past,\" he said. \"They don't talk about the 1950 World Cup. It happened too long ago.\" \u0095 Alex Bellos's book on Brazilian football will be published by Bloomsbury in 2002.",

      "bodyText": "Jack Straw yesterday agreed two important concessions in his football hooligans bill in an attempt to win Tory support for the measure and a safe passage through the Lords before the summer recess. He has tabled key amendments following private correspondence with the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, and representations from former law lords and the former attorney general, Sir Nicholas Lyell. Mr Straw is redrafting the bill to make it clear that potential troublemakers will be barred from travelling abroad by magistrates only if it is believed they have committed or contributed to an act in Britain or elsewhere which would constitute a criminal offence in Britain. The bill, as drafted, would give magistrates powers to impose a banning order even if the past disorderly behaviour would not be considered suffi ciently serious as to be regarded criminal in the view of British or foreign courts. The change, to be debated in Commons committee stages on Monday, is likely to remove Sir Nicholas's main grounds for continued opposition to the measure. The move may, however, deepen the divisions in the Tory party where Miss Widdecombe is struggling to prevent it from openly splitting on the issue. The Conservative party abstained at the second reading, but will be under pressure to vote for the measure at the third reading next week, so reducing the scope for opposition in the Lords. In a second concession, Mr Straw has also decided to limit the police powers to detain someone for 24 hours. The bill as originally drafted gave the police powers to detain someone prior to seeking a banning order solely if it appeared to the constable that the behaviour of the individual was such that immediate in quiries should be made about their past behaviour. This largely subjective test will be replaced with a requirement that the behaviour of the individual gives the officer reasonable grounds to believe they may have contributed to violence or disorder in the past. The past act of violence or disorder of which the officer has suspicion would also have to be of a criminal standard. There had been fears that the bill as originally drafted meant the police could detain someone merely because of their dress, demeanour or even a tattoo. Although the amendments may appear technical, they go to the heart of the concerns raised by many senior Conservatives worried at the civil liberties implications of the proposals. Mr Straw's office was in touch with the Conservatives yesterday to inform them of the proposed amendments. Home Office draftsmen drew the bill so widely because they wanted to give police powers to stop a potential hooligan whom they believe is intent on committing a crime. Intent to commit a crime, such as violence or disorderly behaviour, is not necessarily an offence in itself. The bill will still face a rough passage since the police will retain powers, albeit circumscribed, to detain for 24 hours even though no criminal offence has been committed. Concerns remain that magistrates in imposing a banning order can take account of any decision by a public authority, a catch-all provision in the view of the bill's critics. A number of lawyers have also warned that the power to arrest simply to make inquiries about someone's past will represent a breach of the Human Rights Act when it comes into force on October 2. Home Office officials deny this, saying the police already have wide powers to arrest someone on suspicion that they are likely to commit an offence.",

The case is the first of its kind in England, but last February Scotland's appeal court threw out a drink driving prosecution against Margaret Brown, 30, after she confessed to police, who found her over the alcohol limit at an all-night supermarket, that she had driven her car there. The Road Traffic Act makes it an offence to refuse to give police the name and address of the driver, effectively forcing drivers to incriminate themselves. The judgment followed the Scotland Act, which incorporated the European convention into Scottish law as part of the devolution process last year. It caused an outcry in Scotland where hundreds of prosecutions have been held up pending an appeal. The Human Rights Act, which incorporates the convention into English law, will not come into force until October. But lawyers said judges are taking it into account in the run-up to the act so as not to clog up the courts with ap peals and challenges from October. The crown prosecution service is almost certain to appeal against Judge Crawford's ruling. A spokeswoman said: \"We are studying the judge's remarks very carefully and will be seeking counsel's advice to see what to do next.\" The Human Rights Act has retrospective provisions which could allow those already convicted on the strength of their own admissions that they were driving the car to have their convictions reopened. But Ben Emmerson, a human rights QC, said the judges would probably use their dis cretion to limit appeals to cases where \"substantial injustice\" had resulted. The two Birmingham men were sent standard police letters warning them that they might be prosecuted and asking them to give the name and address of the person driving at the time. Owen Davies, a QC specialising in criminal law and public law, said: \"It sounds like an outrageous decision but it is not if you consider the underlying principle. The right not to incriminate oneself is a curb on the oppressive use of might by the state.\" Jonathan Walker, a partner in the Birmingham solicitors, Challinors Lyon Clark, said it would be open to police to remove the threat of prosecution for failing to give the information. \"But without the threat of prosecution, people are not going to bother answering the letter, which puts them in a bit of a hole.\"",

Permission for the BBC to film was approved by Mr Campbell despite opposition from senior staff, who feared the programme could cause a backlash against the government's special advisers.",

      "body": "<p>Fiji found itself edging into the league of pariah states yesterday as George Speight, who ousted a multi-ethnic democratic government in the name of domination for indigenous Fijians, strengthened his grip on power.</p> <p>An insouciant Mr Speight told outsiders to \"butt out\" of Fiji's affairs and leave it to native Fijians to decide their own direction.</p> <p>For the moment, he seemed in control. His preferred candidates were in place as president and vice-president, and a new transitional administration was being formed to include some of his close collaborators.</p> <p>Mr Speight and his followers got the amnesty they were promised in a deal with the military after his henchmen surrendered the weapons they used to occupy parliament, where they had held a group of politicians hostage since mid-May. Among these was Mahendra Chaudhry, forced out as Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister.</p> <p>Mr Speight's group has an assurance from power-brokers in the army and the indigenous Great Council of Chiefs that the 1997 constitution, which increased the political rights of Indo-Fijians, will be revoked. It is already suspended.</p> <p>Among many international condemnations of the Speight faction, that of New Zealand's foreign affairs minister was one of the most stinging: \"These people are self-serving ... they don't like democracy because democracy didn't serve their own ends,\" Phil Goff said.</p> <p>Mr Speight, who handed in 70 weapons including semi-automatic guns and landmines as a condition of the amnesty for him and his men, said such critics should \"butt out\". There would be no return to a government led by Indo-Fijians.</p> <p>\"Any attempt by anyone to return Fiji to the status quo before May 19 [when the rebels brought parliament to a halt] will be met with the same resistance we showed to the army of this country,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It's about time the world started listening to the fact that Fijians have the ultimate right to determine where Fiji goes in the future.\"</p> <p>The United States, Australia and New Zealand have all urged their citizens to leave Fiji due to the unstable situa tion. The civilian coup has weakened not only the government but also the police and the army, which temporarily stepped in while the government was in limbo.</p> <p>With police nervous of intervening, there was more trouble in the vital tourism industry: tribesmen armed with knives and pipes attacked a luxury resort and beat up its European manager in a dispute over land rights.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Great Council of Chiefs installed Jope Seniloli as vice- president, having appointing Josefa Iloilo as president on Thursday.</p> <p>Mr Speight is claiming victory, confident that the new president will support his side's nationalistic and anti-Indian philosophy when it comes to putting together a government to replace the one led by Mr Chaudhry.</p> <p>The rebel leader clearly felt he was pulling the strings when it came to drawing up a cabinet list: \"I have left it to the discretion of the president,\" he said, \"but you know he might want to change a couple of names in there but there are certain key people in the key portfolios that must be in the hands of our people.\"</p> <p>The chairman of the chiefs' council meeting was the former prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, who led the 1987 coup against a government formed by two mainly Indo-Fijian parties.

      "bodyText": "Fiji found itself edging into the league of pariah states yesterday as George Speight, who ousted a multi-ethnic democratic government in the name of domination for indigenous Fijians, strengthened his grip on power. An insouciant Mr Speight told outsiders to \"butt out\" of Fiji's affairs and leave it to native Fijians to decide their own direction. For the moment, he seemed in control. His preferred candidates were in place as president and vice-president, and a new transitional administration was being formed to include some of his close collaborators. Mr Speight and his followers got the amnesty they were promised in a deal with the military after his henchmen surrendered the weapons they used to occupy parliament, where they had held a group of politicians hostage since mid-May. Among these was Mahendra Chaudhry, forced out as Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister. Mr Speight's group has an assurance from power-brokers in the army and the indigenous Great Council of Chiefs that the 1997 constitution, which increased the political rights of Indo-Fijians, will be revoked. It is already suspended. Among many international condemnations of the Speight faction, that of New Zealand's foreign affairs minister was one of the most stinging: \"These people are self-serving ... they don't like democracy because democracy didn't serve their own ends,\" Phil Goff said. Mr Speight, who handed in 70 weapons including semi-automatic guns and landmines as a condition of the amnesty for him and his men, said such critics should \"butt out\". There would be no return to a government led by Indo-Fijians. \"Any attempt by anyone to return Fiji to the status quo before May 19 [when the rebels brought parliament to a halt] will be met with the same resistance we showed to the army of this country,\" he said. \"It's about time the world started listening to the fact that Fijians have the ultimate right to determine where Fiji goes in the future.\" The United States, Australia and New Zealand have all urged their citizens to leave Fiji due to the unstable situa tion. The civilian coup has weakened not only the government but also the police and the army, which temporarily stepped in while the government was in limbo. With police nervous of intervening, there was more trouble in the vital tourism industry: tribesmen armed with knives and pipes attacked a luxury resort and beat up its European manager in a dispute over land rights. Meanwhile, the Great Council of Chiefs installed Jope Seniloli as vice- president, having appointing Josefa Iloilo as president on Thursday. Mr Speight is claiming victory, confident that the new president will support his side's nationalistic and anti-Indian philosophy when it comes to putting together a government to replace the one led by Mr Chaudhry. The rebel leader clearly felt he was pulling the strings when it came to drawing up a cabinet list: \"I have left it to the discretion of the president,\" he said, \"but you know he might want to change a couple of names in there but there are certain key people in the key portfolios that must be in the hands of our people.\" The chairman of the chiefs' council meeting was the former prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, who led the 1987 coup against a government formed by two mainly Indo-Fijian parties. He denied the chiefs had simply done Mr Speight's bidding although both Mr Iloilo and Mr Seniloli had been endorsed by the rebel leader. But he conceded that the crisis had left the Fiji islands very damaged: \"Nobody wins a coup,\" he said. \"The whole nation suffers. He [Speight] is free to enjoy his self-perceived victory.\" Mr Speight claimed to be acting on behalf of indigenous Fijians when he and his gang raided parliament on May 19 and took Mr Chaudhry and 26 others hostage. But while there has been some talk of sanctions in support of the restoration of full rights for Indo-Fijians, the in ternational community - while it might come up with some symbolic punishment - seemed reluctant yesterday to impose new hardships on the country. The past two months of disruption has already hurt the main industry, sugar, and tourist bookings have plummeted. An expected exodus of Indo-Fijian businessmen and professionals will further reduce domestic investment. Australia's foreign minister, Alexander Downer, said any Fijian attempt to disenfranchise the country's ethnic Indian population, who 44% of the total, was doomed but he was wary of cutting trade and aid links. \"We're not prepared to destroy the Fijian economy,\" he said. \"I know some people say we should, but I think that would be grossly irresponsible.\" Fiji's tourist image as a South Pacific paradise is tarnished after attacks on island resorts by indigenous landowners, some wearing balaclavas and wielding knives. In the worst case, managers of the Laucala Island Resort, Ric and Carol West, aged 48 and 44, were beaten and tied up by drunken villagers carrying cane knives and steel pipes who vandalised the facilities. The resort shut down when the coup began two months ago. The villagers freed the Wests and left just in time to benefit from yesterday's amnesty for \"political acts\" by Mr Speight and anyone acting in his name.",

Josefa Iloilo, the man selected by the council as the new president, is a traditional chief from the western part of Fiji's main island, Viti Levu. He is expected to include in his interim administration several of the rebel politicians who held the country to ransom. The country's next constitution is likely to reserve the prime ministership for an indigenous Fijian, and significantly boost Fijian representation in parliament. Already, Indo-Fijian homesteads near Mr Speight's home village in eastern Fiji have been ransacked, and some burned to the ground. The victims had little recourse because the neighbouring police station, at Korovou town, had been seized by rebel militants. Nearby, an Indo-Fijian wedding party travelling through a roadblock set up at Korovou was stopped by villagers who fleeced the group for jewellery and cash. A policeman called the action \"political\", implying that it was covered by the amnesty for Speight followers agreed by Mr Speight and the army. In the squatter settlements around the capital, Suva, Indo-Fijian families have been pushed out of their homes on the Jittu estate, after refusing to make payments demanded by indigenous Fijian neighbours. Sixty Fiji Telecom workers went on strike this week until their Indo-Fijian general manager, Pratap Singh, was removed from his post. Under British colonial rule, some 60,000 workers from the Indian sub-continent were imported between 1879 and 1916, mainly to work on sugar plantations. Bonded labour ended in 1920, and Indo-Fijians commenced their long struggle for greater political rights. By the 1960s, Indians briefly formed a majority of the population, but now they make up 44%, with indigenous Fijians at 51%. After independence in 1970, an alliance between the descendants of white settlers and leading indigenous Fijian politicians held sway. Indo-Fijians had considerable business success, but their parties were kept on the opposition benches. In 1987, two largely Indo-Fijian parties - the Fiji Labour party and National Federation party - won elections and briefly formed a government. Mahendra Chaudhry was its finance minister. Two weeks later, a military coup led by Lieutenant-Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka put ethnic Fijian politicians back in charge until Mr Chaudhry's election in May last year. After the 1987 coup, some 75,000 Indo-Fijians - including doctors, lawyers and businessmen - left for New Zealand, Australia and Canada. The same is likely this time around. Domestic investment has also been low ever since 1987, largely because wealthier Indo-Fijians diversified their assets abroad. Affirmative action programmes for native Fijians have not worked well. Many poorer Indo-Fijians work in the sugar industry. Indian cane farmers often lease farms from the native Fijians, who own 83% of all land in Fiji. Until 1997, cane farmers had reasonably secure 30-year leases, but since then increasing numbers have been evicted as their leases expired. With an indigenous supremacist government in power, many more will be evicted, but now without compensation.

      "bodyText": "Nelson Mandela, the former South African president, yesterday used all his authority to end the destructive dispute in his country over the cause of Aids and urge scientists and politicians to work together in the battle against a disease that is devastating the continent. In a powerful and dignified speech, Mr Mandela offered Africa the leadership it needs in the battle against Aids and a blueprint for the way forward. To the delight of scientists and a rapturous reception from the 12,000 delegates at the closing ceremony of the international Aids conference in Durban, he said the rhetoric must end and action begin. He sent a coded message to his successor Thabo Mbeki that the delays over introducing new preventive measures and drug treatments to stop the spread of HIV must stop. \"The ordinary people of this continent and the world - and particularly the poor who on our continent will again carry a disproportionate burden of this scourge - would, if anyone cared to ask their opinions, wish that the dispute about the primacy of politics or science be put on the backburner and that we proceed to address the needs and concerns of those suffering and dying. And this can only be done in partnership. \"In the face of the grave threat posed by HIV/Aids, we have to rise above our differences and combine our efforts to save our people. History will judge us harshly if we fail to do so now, and right now. \"Let us not equivocate: a tragedy of unprecedented proportions is unfolding in Africa. Aids today in Africa is claiming more lives than the sum total of all wars, famines and floods and the ravages of such deadly diseases as malaria. It is devastating families and communities; overwhelming and depleting health care services and robbing schools of both students and teachers.\" Mr Mandela praised Mr Mbeki as \"a man of great intellect who takes scientific thinking very seriously and he leads a government that I know to be committed to those principles of science and reason\". But he went on: \"He will, with me, be the first to concede that much more remains to be done _ The challenge is to move from rhetoric to action, and action at an unprecedented intensity and scale.\" He spelled out what needed to be done, including, to cheers and applause, the introduction of drugs to prevent women in labour passing HIV infection to their babies - an issue that the Mbeki government has dragged its feet on. Mr Mandela said that his country must look to Uganda, Senegal and Thailand which had successfully started to turn the tide of HIV/Aids. He set out a detailed and unequivocal blueprint for Africa. \"Promoting abstinence, safe sex and the use of condoms and ensuring the early treatment of sexually transmitted diseases are some of the steps needed and about which there can be no dispute. Ensuring that people have access to voluntary and HIV counselling and testing services and introducing measures to reduce mother-to-child transmission have been proven to be essential in the fight against Aids.\" At the same time, he said, \"we need to continue the international effort of searching for appropriate vaccines\" as well as working with families and communities to care for children and young people and protect them from violence and abuse. He made it plain he was prepared to offer the kind of leadership to Africa in its struggle against Aids that scientists had hoped for from Mr Mbeki. \"We need, and there is increasing evidence of, African resolve to fight this war.

Marjorie Evans, 55, who has been suspended since the incident in September last year, was found guilty of hitting the boy when he started struggling after being told he could not go to a swimming lesson with classmates at his school in south Wales. The verdict was immediately condemned by the school's chairman of governors and by Mrs Evans' union, the NUT, which has said it may appeal. Gethin Lewis, secretary of the NUT in Wales, said parents and teachers would hear about the case with disbelief. \"There will be shivers of fear throughout classrooms in England and Wales when news of the case gets out. The authority of teachers and headteachers has been put into question by this decision.\" Mrs Evans, denied hitting the boy, but was yesterday convicted of assault by magistrates in Abergavenny, Gwent, following a five-day trial. Sentencing has been adjourned for two weeks and Mrs Evans has been warned she could face a jail term. Neither the boy, who is now aged 11, nor the school can be identified for legal reasons. Mrs Evans, described in court as a teacher with a glowing reputation, told magistrates that she had restrained the boy after he tried to push, punch and headbutt her. But the court was told that she had used her open palm to slap the \"sullen\" pupil after momentarily losing her self-control. Christopher Rees, for the prosecution, said it had not been necessary for the teacher to defend herself and her actions could not be described as reasonable force. The court heard that on the day of the incident the school was facing a staffing crisis and that the headmistress had to leave her office to fill in because the boy's teacher had a medical appointment. The boy, who has learning difficulties and was on medication, wanted to go swimming but had been banned from going because of earlier bad behaviour. He told magistrates that an argument broke out over work he was keeping in the classroom. He said the headmistress grabbed him and took him outside. \"She picked my trays up and pushed them against my chest. I pushed her and she fell backwards on to the bench.

As parents yesterday defended Mrs Evans' running of the 300-pupil school it emerged that Monmouthshire education authority was investigating fresh allegations that children at the school had on occasions been treated \"inappropriately\" by staff. Phil Cooke, the council's director of education, said the matter would be looked into as a matter of urgency by child protection agencies including police and social services. However, the mother of one child at the school said Mrs Evans was \"firm but fair\" and was well-respected by teachers and staff.

      "bodyText": "Fan power forced the BBC into one of its most bizarre about-turns last night when Andy Kershaw, the cult DJ dumped by Radio 1, was rehired by Radio 3. Kershaw, the Lancastrian whose late-night slot put world music stars like Youssou N'Dour on the map here, was dropped by Radio 1 in May amid a storm of protest about the direction the station was going in. Controller Andy Parfitt was assailed from all quarters for his \"shabby treatment of Radio 1's most innovative voice\" and pilloried for allegedly pandering to the teen market with a diet of boy bands and commercial pop. As condemnation of the decision grew, Kershaw, who had been angry at the graveyard slot he had been forced into after 14 years, refused to host his final few shows. But yesterday Roger Wright, Parfitt's opposite number on Radio 3, stepped in to an nounce a new slot for the DJ on his World Routes programme beginning this summer. Kershaw will travel the world for the programme, presented by Lucy Duran, and bring back regular reports and recordings he has made on the road. Signing up Kershaw is a coup for Wright, who has been trying to broaden Radio 3's appeal. Kershaw joked last night: \"I imagine I'll be coming in once a month with a bunch of un popular records, just as I've always done. \"About six months ago I had lunch with Roger Wright and he asked me if I'd be interested in doing bits and pieces for him. What convinced me was when he said: 'I want Radio 3 to be more than a classical music station'.\" He said he knew he had to go with Wright when he told him that the thing he most liked about his old show was \"that I never know what's coming next\". \"That was exactly what the Radio 1 controller hated about my programme,\" said Kershaw. He has spent the past few months working on a book about his travels, as well as doing his World Service programme. \"One of the things I was worried about was would there be a lot of hostility from the traditional core audience of Radio 3 - an ex-Radio 1 DJ coming in and playing African music?\" he said. \"I was more worried for Roger Wright than for me.\" Wright also announced that the playwright Mark Ravenhill, best known for his West End play Shopping and Fucking, had been commissioned to write a play for Radio 3. The commissioning of the controversial Ravenhill, who is known for his expletive-strewn scripts, highlights Wright's mission to set the genteel Radio 3 apart from its commercial radio competitor, Classic FM. The play, which does not yet have a title, will feature in a season of new works called The Wire. Wright said yesterday that Ravenhill's work would not be bleeped out. \"If you commission writers you want them to be themselves, not tell them how to write. \"But that's not to say that we're pushing boundaries of taste and decency. \"If there are a large number of expletives we will probably put a health warning on it.\" He added: \"It's a mature, intelligent, grown-up audience, who should be able to make their own minds up.\"",

      "body": "<p>If you concentrate hard enough tonight you may glimpse a man called Godric Smith on television. No, I had never heard of him either until recently. He is, in the nicest possible way, an anonymous looking man: balding, early forties in a self-effacing two-piece suit.</p> <p>What do we know about this Godric Smith? We know that, despite reading classics at Oxford, he supports struggling Cambridge United. We know he is married with two children and lives in north London. And that since 1998 he has been the prime minister's deputy press spokesman.</p> <p>Do I crave to know more about Godric Smith? With all respect to Mr Smith, I cannot say that I do. In an ideal world he would remain a relatively anonymous figure and be the giver of dispassionate, factual information on behalf of the prime minister. It would be nice if he would speak on the record and, preferably, on camera. Otherwise, it would be a relief to know nothing about him.</p> <p>Mr Smith has a small, non-speaking role in Michael Cockerell's film about Mr Smith's boss, Alastair Campbell, which is being shown on BBC2 this evening. The two men could not be more different. Not even his worst enemy would call Mr Campbell shy, self-effacing or balding. Unlike Mr Smith, Mr Campbell is not a career civil servant. Whereas Mr Smith is anonymous, Mr Campbell is only supposed to be anonymous. He is the subject of at least one full-length book and a television profile. The only thing the two men have in common is a shared passion for Nationwide League football teams.</p> <p>How, one wonders, could these two men conceivably perform the same role? One is a self-confessed propagandist, the other a career Whitehall information officer. One is a bruiser, a spinner and, if necessary, an assassin. The other is supposedly apolitical. The service which employs Mr Smith requires him to be \"objective and explanatory, not tendentious or polemical ... or liable to misrepresentation as being party political\".</p> <p>The difference between the two men might matter less if we, the press, had not connived with them in pretending they are one and the same person. Both have for a long time sheltered behind the comfortable semi-anonymity of being \"a Downing Street spokesman\", or an \"official source\", or \"a source close to the prime minister\". After Michael Cockerell's programme it is difficult to see how this coyness and circumlocution can possibly continue.</p> <p>Indeed, after tonight's programme, it is difficult to see why anyone would want the present arrangements to persist. The interaction between Mr Campbell (even on his best behaviour) and Her Majesty's Lobby appears close to what psychotherapists term \"an abusive relationship\" - one in which the part ners feel trapped in a downward spiral of passive-aggressive behaviour.</p> <p>A recent bestselling American self-help book on the subject identified helpful ways of identifying the symptoms: \"Does your partner seem irritated or angry at you several times a week? Does he deny being angry when he clearly is? Do you frequently feel perplexed and frustrated by his responses, as though you were each speaking a different language?\"</p> <p>Both partners in this increasingly loveless relationship - Mr Campbell and the Lobby - would answer \"yes\" to all of the above. Yet, as any self-help devotee will tell you, the destructive thing about these abusive relationships is that - though it makes them miserable - neither party can escape.</p> <p>And, true enough, Mr Cockerell's film ended with forlorn Lobby journalists complaining bitterly that Mr Smith's kindly, caring, objective briefings were no fun. They wanted to get back to the daily ritual of mutual abuse.</p> <p>There is a serious point behind all this, which is that the word \"spin\" is to this government what \"sleaze\" was to the last. Whether it is the press or the government who is chiefly to blame is in a sense beside the point. Something has to be done to untie the knot before Westminster politics and press become terminally polluted by mutual cynicism and disrespect.</p> <p>It appears that this thought has already dawned on Number 10. The decision to pull Mr Campbell out of day-to-day close combat with the Lobby was Mr Blair's. This week's televised press conference was a White House- inspired device to speak directly to the public without the filter of the Lobby.</p> <p>But the sterile nature of the present relationship is also appreciated by the more thoughtful members of the press corps. Elinor Goodman, the political editor of Channel 4, gave a speech this week in which she said: \"I think it is arguable that political journalists have been a corrosive force over the past 10 years. My own view is that the symbiotic relationship between politicians and the media has helped create an age of cynicism in which it's extremely difficult to have a rational debate.\"</p> <p>The Guardian was one of three papers to leave the Lobby in 1986 in protest at the way in which systematic unattributable briefings were being misused. That generation of Lobby correspondents was not sympathetic: the Lobby voted 67 to 55 to keep all briefings off the record.</p> <p>It is ironic that such movement as there has been since to put the briefings on the record has largely come from government. Mr Campbell himself has tiptoed some way to greater openness, with edited versions of the daily briefing on the Downing Street website.</p> <p>But even he has stepped back from going the whole way. When the Guardian published the first verbatim transcript of a Lobby briefing in March, he dropped us a quiet note saying that he had not intended that all Lobby briefings should now be fully on the record and attributable. At the same time the cost of the Strategic Communications Unit has risen from \u00a377,633 in 1997/8 to \u00a3839,440 in the current year.</p> <p>It is not clear that much would be gained from again boycotting these semi-open Lobby briefings. But in future all Guardian journalists attending them will, as a matter of policy, identify who the briefer is. It is no longer right that readers should be in doubt whether this is Alastair spin or Godric briefing.</p> <p>More difficult is the whole question of attribution. In politics - as in virtually every other walk of life - people will often speak more honestly if they are allowed to speak anonymously. The use of non-attributed quotes can thus assist the reader towards a truer understanding than if a journalist confined him/herself to quoting the bland banalities that often pass for on-the-record quotes.</p> <p>One example: a recent article in the Guardian was the subject of a drily critical letter from Lord Wigoder. He drew attention to no fewer than 11 anonymous quotes attributed to such sources as \"a Labour business adviser\", \"a senior Labour figure\" and \"one wealthy businessman.\"</p> <p>I know - because I made inquiries - that virtually all these quotes came from people with direct knowledge of the relevant matter. As an editor, I was satisfied that this was an exceptionally well-informed and accurate piece of reporting. The Guardian reader was, I thought, well-served.</p> <p>But journalism which is not believed has failed. If many readers felt they had insufficient clue as to whether the alleged \"sources\" spoke with authority and remained deeply sceptical about the provenance of the quotes, then it is difficult to make a case that the article did serve our readers well.</p> <p>What, to take another recent example, are we to make of the recent front page splash in a mid-market tabloid: \"Power crazed and bonkers\" was the bold headline above a picture of Gordon Brown. The story was a brutal attack on the chancellor sourced to \"a government colleague\".</p> <p>The article was by the paper's political editor - ironically, one of the journalists who led the Independent out of the Lobby 14 years ago. The attribution was so vague as to be meaningless to any reader. The Observer's famous earlier anonymous attack on Brown - \"he has psychological flaws\" - was at least sourced to \"someone who has an exceedingly good claim to know the mind of the prime minister\".</p> <p>Even this quote would not have got through the editorial process of the New York Times. Its style guide reads: \"Anonymity must not become a cloak for attacks on people ... If pejorative remarks are worth reporting and cannot be specifically attributed they may be paraphrased or described after thorough discussion between writer and editor.</p> <p>\"The vivid language of direct quotation confers an unfair advantage on a speaker or writer who hides behind the newspaper, and turns of phrase are valueless to a reader who cannot assess the source.\"</p> <p>These are good rules, though - as those who have worked in both countries admit - they are easier to apply in the monopoly environment of New York broadsheet journalism than in the ruthlessly competitive world of Fleet Street.</p> <p>If applied here, the curtain would come down on whoever it is whose job it is to drip anonymous poison over the heads of Harriet Harman, Frank Field, Ken Follett, Lord Winston, Clare Short, Ken Livingstone, Stephen Byers, Mo Mowlam, Gordon Brown, David Clark or whomever the victim of the moment is deemed to be.</p> <p>But it is not absolutely clear that the bringing down of this curtain would inevitably cause greater enlightenment amongst readers. Would the public interest have been served by denying readers the knowledge that the skids were under John Biffen or Francis Pym?</p> <p>S hould the papers of the day have kept quiet about the increasing friction between Mrs Thatcher and Geoffrey Howe, simply because no one would go on the record about it? If part of the truth about the present government is that it is genuinely riven by personal bitterness and mistrust, how can it be truthful to ignore the fact?</p> <p>One of the reasons that some journalists feel locked into their love-hate relationship with Mr Campbell is that they feel he truly knows and understands the day to day thinking of the prime minister. Some reporters are adamant that the interests of the reader are best served by being able to quote him, even if they are obliged to disguise the origin of the quote.</p> <p>We do not claim great moral superiority in these matters on the Guardian. But I do feel that we could do better in trying to break with some of the worst customs that have become ingrained in political reporting over the past 10 or so years.</p> <p>In addition to naming the spokesman at official lobbying briefings, we will adopt a stricter code on the use of anonymous pejorative quotes. And we will encourage reporters to be as specific as possible about the source of any anonymous quotation. \"One MP\", or \"a government colleague\" is so weak as to be meaningless. \"Senior minister\" is an advance. \"Cabinet minister with direct knowledge of the negotiations\" is better still. By now the reader can genuinely evaluate the worth of the remark.</p> <p>We will codify these guidelines and publish them: doubtless we will break them from time to time. But we will do our best to make a start on the road to more valuable and evaluate-able reporting. It would be good if you - the readers - had some input into the process.</p> <p>You already use the independent readers' editor and letters columns to make your views known. In that respect, I believe the Guardian is already the most open and honest paper in Britain. But it would be interesting and helpful to hear the general views of readers on how we can best convey the true flavour of British politics as it is lived, breathed and briefed about.</p> <p>Alan Rusbridger is editor of the Guardian. <a href=\"mailto:alan.rusbridger@theguardian.com\">alan.rusbridger@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>News from Number Ten is on BBC2 tonight at 7.40pm.

The service which employs Mr Smith requires him to be \"objective and explanatory, not tendentious or polemical ... or liable to misrepresentation as being party political\". The difference between the two men might matter less if we, the press, had not connived with them in pretending they are one and the same person. Both have for a long time sheltered behind the comfortable semi-anonymity of being \"a Downing Street spokesman\", or an \"official source\", or \"a source close to the prime minister\". After Michael Cockerell's programme it is difficult to see how this coyness and circumlocution can possibly continue. Indeed, after tonight's programme, it is difficult to see why anyone would want the present arrangements to persist. The interaction between Mr Campbell (even on his best behaviour) and Her Majesty's Lobby appears close to what psychotherapists term \"an abusive relationship\" - one in which the part ners feel trapped in a downward spiral of passive-aggressive behaviour. A recent bestselling American self-help book on the subject identified helpful ways of identifying the symptoms: \"Does your partner seem irritated or angry at you several times a week? Does he deny being angry when he clearly is? Do you frequently feel perplexed and frustrated by his responses, as though you were each speaking a different language?\" Both partners in this increasingly loveless relationship - Mr Campbell and the Lobby - would answer \"yes\" to all of the above. Yet, as any self-help devotee will tell you, the destructive thing about these abusive relationships is that - though it makes them miserable - neither party can escape. And, true enough, Mr Cockerell's film ended with forlorn Lobby journalists complaining bitterly that Mr Smith's kindly, caring, objective briefings were no fun. They wanted to get back to the daily ritual of mutual abuse. There is a serious point behind all this, which is that the word \"spin\" is to this government what \"sleaze\" was to the last. Whether it is the press or the government who is chiefly to blame is in a sense beside the point. Something has to be done to untie the knot before Westminster politics and press become terminally polluted by mutual cynicism and disrespect. It appears that this thought has already dawned on Number 10. The decision to pull Mr Campbell out of day-to-day close combat with the Lobby was Mr Blair's. This week's televised press conference was a White House- inspired device to speak directly to the public without the filter of the Lobby. But the sterile nature of the present relationship is also appreciated by the more thoughtful members of the press corps. Elinor Goodman, the political editor of Channel 4, gave a speech this week in which she said: \"I think it is arguable that political journalists have been a corrosive force over the past 10 years. My own view is that the symbiotic relationship between politicians and the media has helped create an age of cynicism in which it's extremely difficult to have a rational debate.\" The Guardian was one of three papers to leave the Lobby in 1986 in protest at the way in which systematic unattributable briefings were being misused. That generation of Lobby correspondents was not sympathetic: the Lobby voted 67 to 55 to keep all briefings off the record. It is ironic that such movement as there has been since to put the briefings on the record has largely come from government. Mr Campbell himself has tiptoed some way to greater openness, with edited versions of the daily briefing on the Downing Street website. But even he has stepped back from going the whole way. When the Guardian published the first verbatim transcript of a Lobby briefing in March, he dropped us a quiet note saying that he had not intended that all Lobby briefings should now be fully on the record and attributable. At the same time the cost of the Strategic Communications Unit has risen from \u00a377,633 in 1997/8 to \u00a3839,440 in the current year. It is not clear that much would be gained from again boycotting these semi-open Lobby briefings. But in future all Guardian journalists attending them will, as a matter of policy, identify who the briefer is. It is no longer right that readers should be in doubt whether this is Alastair spin or Godric briefing. More difficult is the whole question of attribution. In politics - as in virtually every other walk of life - people will often speak more honestly if they are allowed to speak anonymously. The use of non-attributed quotes can thus assist the reader towards a truer understanding than if a journalist confined him/herself to quoting the bland banalities that often pass for on-the-record quotes. One example: a recent article in the Guardian was the subject of a drily critical letter from Lord Wigoder. He drew attention to no fewer than 11 anonymous quotes attributed to such sources as \"a Labour business adviser\", \"a senior Labour figure\" and \"one wealthy businessman.\" I know - because I made inquiries - that virtually all these quotes came from people with direct knowledge of the relevant matter. As an editor, I was satisfied that this was an exceptionally well-informed and accurate piece of reporting. The Guardian reader was, I thought, well-served. But journalism which is not believed has failed. If many readers felt they had insufficient clue as to whether the alleged \"sources\" spoke with authority and remained deeply sceptical about the provenance of the quotes, then it is difficult to make a case that the article did serve our readers well. What, to take another recent example, are we to make of the recent front page splash in a mid-market tabloid: \"Power crazed and bonkers\" was the bold headline above a picture of Gordon Brown. The story was a brutal attack on the chancellor sourced to \"a government colleague\". The article was by the paper's political editor - ironically, one of the journalists who led the Independent out of the Lobby 14 years ago. The attribution was so vague as to be meaningless to any reader. The Observer's famous earlier anonymous attack on Brown - \"he has psychological flaws\" - was at least sourced to \"someone who has an exceedingly good claim to know the mind of the prime minister\". Even this quote would not have got through the editorial process of the New York Times. Its style guide reads: \"Anonymity must not become a cloak for attacks on people ... If pejorative remarks are worth reporting and cannot be specifically attributed they may be paraphrased or described after thorough discussion between writer and editor. \"The vivid language of direct quotation confers an unfair advantage on a speaker or writer who hides behind the newspaper, and turns of phrase are valueless to a reader who cannot assess the source.\" These are good rules, though - as those who have worked in both countries admit - they are easier to apply in the monopoly environment of New York broadsheet journalism than in the ruthlessly competitive world of Fleet Street. If applied here, the curtain would come down on whoever it is whose job it is to drip anonymous poison over the heads of Harriet Harman, Frank Field, Ken Follett, Lord Winston, Clare Short, Ken Livingstone, Stephen Byers, Mo Mowlam, Gordon Brown, David Clark or whomever the victim of the moment is deemed to be. But it is not absolutely clear that the bringing down of this curtain would inevitably cause greater enlightenment amongst readers. Would the public interest have been served by denying readers the knowledge that the skids were under John Biffen or Francis Pym? S hould the papers of the day have kept quiet about the increasing friction between Mrs Thatcher and Geoffrey Howe, simply because no one would go on the record about it? If part of the truth about the present government is that it is genuinely riven by personal bitterness and mistrust, how can it be truthful to ignore the fact? One of the reasons that some journalists feel locked into their love-hate relationship with Mr Campbell is that they feel he truly knows and understands the day to day thinking of the prime minister. Some reporters are adamant that the interests of the reader are best served by being able to quote him, even if they are obliged to disguise the origin of the quote. We do not claim great moral superiority in these matters on the Guardian. But I do feel that we could do better in trying to break with some of the worst customs that have become ingrained in political reporting over the past 10 or so years. In addition to naming the spokesman at official lobbying briefings, we will adopt a stricter code on the use of anonymous pejorative quotes. And we will encourage reporters to be as specific as possible about the source of any anonymous quotation. \"One MP\", or \"a government colleague\" is so weak as to be meaningless. \"Senior minister\" is an advance. \"Cabinet minister with direct knowledge of the negotiations\" is better still. By now the reader can genuinely evaluate the worth of the remark. We will codify these guidelines and publish them: doubtless we will break them from time to time. But we will do our best to make a start on the road to more valuable and evaluate-able reporting. It would be good if you - the readers - had some input into the process. You already use the independent readers' editor and letters columns to make your views known. In that respect, I believe the Guardian is already the most open and honest paper in Britain. But it would be interesting and helpful to hear the general views of readers on how we can best convey the true flavour of British politics as it is lived, breathed and briefed about.

The Big Brother production team sets the group various tasks - if the challenges are completed successfully, the particpants can win supplements to their daily allowance of \u00a31.50 each. The allowance can be spent on anything they choose, but the decision is one they have to make together. Much is riding on Big Brother: in Germany and the Netherlands, it has been a smash hit on the scale of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? Some 40,000 applied to take part in the British version, which is being made by Bazal productions, part-owned by the Guardian Media Group. 10 people game for a show Andrew , 23, describes himself as a \"ladies' man\" and boasts of being \"excellent entertainment value\". Craig , 28, says he \"loves a challenge\", and has packed whisky and condoms . Darren , 22, loves to dance and is obsessed with his hair. Has three children and considers himself easy going. Nicholas , 32, a bachelor from a family of nine, a qualified alternative healer, takes kung fu lessons every week. Thomas , 30, the youngest of seven children, lives on his parents' farm. Says he will miss the telephone and internet. Anna , 29, a former trainee nun, has worked in a women's prison. Will miss \"pubs, pals and sex\" most. Caroline , 37, a saxophone player and fan of alternative therapies, once sold sex aids. Melanie , 26, an Elvis Presley fan who will most miss her fake leopard skin coat. Nichola , 28, dreams of being in a circus act, and seeks \"fame and fortune\". Sada , 27, describes the show as \"a chance of a lifetime to learn more about myself\".",

According to NFU figures, imports of strawberries rose 39% in the three years to 1998 - which means that British growers now supply less than half of the 72,000 tonnes bought in Britain each year, despite the country's perfect strawberry growing climate. The lack of British fruit pickers is aggravated by a shortage of foreign students available for temporary summer work. The NFU has set up an email address - at nfu.cropsatnfu.org.uk - for anyone who wants work as a fruit picker. Press Association",

Colin Harrold, 35, had disclosed to his first wife that he was having an affair, then allegedly told her he was \"working on it\" to ensure there would not be a costly divorce arising from his second marriage. On another occasion, Nottingham crown court heard, he told a woman he met in a bar that \"money is changing hands, I'm doing something about it now\". The court also heard from the woman with whom he was having the affair about a day at a health farm where he pretended they were husband and wife. Harrold denies murder and conspiring with Darren Lake, 31, the best man from his first marriage, to murder Diane Harrold, 36. Lake has already pleaded guilty to murder. Mrs Harrold was found dumped in the swimming pool of the couple's home in Uffington, Lincolnshire, last October. James Hunt QC, prosecuting, said cracks began to appear in their two-year marriage, apparently due to Harrold's unwillingness to start a new family, having had two sons from his first marriage. Mr Hunt alleged that Harrold offered Lake \u00a320,000 to murder Mrs Harrold, then throw her body into the outdoor swimming pool at their \u00a3335,000 home. Harrold went to Amsterdam and was in the city's red light district at the time the body was found by police. A fortnight before the murder, the prosecution claimed, Harrold made a chilling revelation to Annette Beck, his first wife.

      "bodyText": "A deepening political scandal which has already caused the first impeachment of a senator in Brazilian history is closing in on President Fernando Henrique Cardoso after a note surfaced showing he requested more money for a corruption-plagued construction project. This week Mr Cardoso denied any wrongdoing after the note was published in the daily Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. Two days earlier he had stated that he was not involved in the funding. The Folha de Sao Paulo said: \"The president's moral integrity is not in question. But the way his administration functions certanly is. It is inadmissible for the government to admit that the president signs documents without reading them.\" \"They basically have found a smoking gun,\" said David Fleischer, professor of politics at Brasilia University. \"This is very worrisome for Cardoso.\" The scandal concerns the theft of up to \u00a360m of public funds from the building of a Sao Paulo courthouse to handle employment disputes. In 1999, a congressional inquiry revealed that the person responsible for the project, senior judge Nicolau Dos Santos Neto, had helped to steal the money. The courthouse is still unfinished, most of the money is missing and Mr Dos Santos Neto is on the run. Last month the affair claimed its most important scalp when congress impeached Senator Luiz Estevao, a prominent developer, over accusations that his company was the main beneficiary of the kickbacks. It was the first time that a member of the senate has been impeached in its 170-year history. The impeachment was hailed as a significant shift in the culture of political impunity in Latin America's largest country. There are demands for the resignation of the planning minister, Martus Tavares, who recommended the release of the extra money. Mr Tavares allegedly offered his resignation but it was refused, according to reports, because that would be an admission of guilt. Mr Tavares criticised media reports for \"opportunism\", and said his ministry \"understands that such news reports reflect, on the one hand, a lack of understanding of the budgetary process, and on the other, bad faith and opportunism by people interested in distorting facts to win political visibility\". In a special edition released after his statement, the political magazine Istoe quoted from taped conversations suggesting that Mr Tavares and Mr Cardoso's former chief of staff, Eduardo Jorge, were involved in the kickback scheme. Members of congress voiced outrage over the revelation that the administration rubber-stamped the extra funding for the courthouse, with one senator from a party allied to the government demanding Mr Tavares' resignation. Opposition members of congress - eyeing October local elections - went further, calling for a congressional probe into Mr Cardoso and his administration. But economists fear that a congressional inquiry would bleed Mr Cardoso of support as he tries to implement his economic reform programme - seen as crucial to help the country recover from last year's devastating collapse of the currency.",

The army says it has killed up to 100 rebels this week on the outskirts of Jaffna town. The Tigers say they have repulsed the army's advances and killed up to 50 soldiers. The Sri Lankan army's spokesman, Brigadier Pallitha Fernando, said troops were staging hit and run attacks against the Tigers - including the use of snipers - and causing heavy casualties on the Tamil side. \"In recent skirmishes the rebels on average lost between seven and eight men a day,\" he said. He was not saying if or when the army would attempt a counter-offensive to recover large amounts of territory lost to the rebels in the Jaffna Peninsula in recent weeks. \"The fact that we have stalled the offensive of the rebels is in itself an achievement,\" he said, \"because in May and June it looked as if they were going to capture Jaffna.\" He said the government was launching a crackdown to try to get 20,000 deserters -- nearly a quarter of the army's strength - to rejoin their units. \"If we are to make inroads against the Tamil Tigers we need the manpower.

He conceded that there was some truth in reports that people with the right connections could evade army service: some army deserters were employed by Sri Lankan members of parliament, he agreed, but said it was a small number out of the total. The latest fighting in Jaffna coincides with new efforts by the government to bring an end to Sri Lanka's 17-year civil war through constitutional changes. The government is hoping that its proposals to revamp the constitution will get the approval of MPs before the country goes to the polls after parliament is dissolved in August. A key part of the package is the formation of an interim council to administer the north and east areas of the island, areas which the Tamil Tigers say should be part of their independent homeland. Last week the government and opposition concluded months of negotiations on the reform package. They agreed that Sri Lanka should have a new constitution, but disagreed over the timing of its introduction.

Goethe, Beethoven and Schiller visited to entertain the aristocracy of Habsburg Europe. But nowadays and unlike most other film festivals, where commercialism and snobbery go hand in hand, Karlovy Vary offers more equality. Here blackties and backpackers mix congenially, queuing together for the chance to buy the 90 pence tickets to more than 700 film screenings. \"The younger film goers have been camping outside, even in miserable weather,\" said Helena Hajova, a festival spokeswoman. She said that 9,000 people had been accredited, doubling last year's numbers. \"Karlovy Vary is considered to be more fun and perhaps less businesslike than Cannes,\" the Hollywood Reporter's eastern Europe correspondent, Nick Holdsworth, said. \"This is unusually a filmmaker's festival where people come to relax, enjoy themselves and watch each other's films.\"",

      "body": "<p>Standard Life yesterday denied allegations that it improperly influenced last month's crucial ballot on its mutual status despite admitting it sent letters to policyholders on other companies' headed paper urging them to vote no to windfalls. </p> <p>The insurer, whose members last month rejected windfalls of \u00a35,000-plus after it was targeted by carpetbaggers, is embroiled in a row with a Belfast independent financial adviser, who claims the company sent letters to more than 400 of his clients advising them to vote for mutuality, without his permission. </p> <p>Standard Life accepts that it sent out the letters, which were written on the adviser's own headed paper, but said its understanding was that the adviser had given his approval for this to happen. </p> <p>The row follows a bitterly fought battle over whether the insurer should stay a mutual or convert to a public company and pay windfalls. </p> <p>The insurer spent millions of pounds promoting the cause of mutuality in the run-up to the June 27 ballot, with advertisements and a series of mailings to its 2.3m members. </p> <p>The letters were disclosed by the BBC. It reported that Colin Cavan, a bar owner from County Down, Northern Ireland, received a letter, apparently from his adviser, David McCullough, urging him to vote no to a windfall. </p> <p>Mr Cavan was surprised because he had already consulted Mr McCullough, who had advised him to vote yes. Mr McCullough then discovered that other clients he had advised to vote for flotation had received similar letters. </p> <p>It is understood that the insurer gave IFAs an opportunity to have letters supporting mutuality sent to Standard Life members who were their clients. </p> <p>Standard Life says that in this case the adviser chose to take part and provided his letterheaded paper to the insurer. </p> <p>The insurer says that it believes it had the adviser's permission to send the letters out to all his policyholder clients, and that he had seen its contents. </p> <p>A spokesman said: \"We believe we have conducted a thoroughly proper campaign in which we laid out the case for mutuality.\" </p> <p>In all, the spokesman added, the company had received less than 200 complaints from members in connection with the ballot from a total mailing of 2.3m policyholders.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Standard Life yesterday denied allegations that it improperly influenced last month's crucial ballot on its mutual status despite admitting it sent letters to policyholders on other companies' headed paper urging them to vote no to windfalls. The insurer, whose members last month rejected windfalls of \u00a35,000-plus after it was targeted by carpetbaggers, is embroiled in a row with a Belfast independent financial adviser, who claims the company sent letters to more than 400 of his clients advising them to vote for mutuality, without his permission. Standard Life accepts that it sent out the letters, which were written on the adviser's own headed paper, but said its understanding was that the adviser had given his approval for this to happen. The row follows a bitterly fought battle over whether the insurer should stay a mutual or convert to a public company and pay windfalls. The insurer spent millions of pounds promoting the cause of mutuality in the run-up to the June 27 ballot, with advertisements and a series of mailings to its 2.3m members. The letters were disclosed by the BBC. It reported that Colin Cavan, a bar owner from County Down, Northern Ireland, received a letter, apparently from his adviser, David McCullough, urging him to vote no to a windfall. Mr Cavan was surprised because he had already consulted Mr McCullough, who had advised him to vote yes. Mr McCullough then discovered that other clients he had advised to vote for flotation had received similar letters. It is understood that the insurer gave IFAs an opportunity to have letters supporting mutuality sent to Standard Life members who were their clients. Standard Life says that in this case the adviser chose to take part and provided his letterheaded paper to the insurer. The insurer says that it believes it had the adviser's permission to send the letters out to all his policyholder clients, and that he had seen its contents. A spokesman said: \"We believe we have conducted a thoroughly proper campaign in which we laid out the case for mutuality.\" In all, the spokesman added, the company had received less than 200 complaints from members in connection with the ballot from a total mailing of 2.3m policyholders.",

The men were burned alive last week, the latest of several lynchings carried out by villagers who believe that the justice system acts neither swiftly nor effectively enough. Mr Portillo announced yesterday that he will introduce new laws to expedite prosecutions of suspects in crimes such as rape and kidnapping in an effort to restore faith in the criminal justice system. There is also concern about the country's international reputation in the wake of the lynching of a Japanese tourist and a tour bus driver in May in the village of Todos Santos after a false rumour had spread that a busload of Japanese tourists had arrived to steal children for Satanic rituals. \"I will ask congress to modify laws that have held up prosecutions,\" Mr Portillo said. \"The public ministry is very slow.\" He also pledged to build 25 new police stations in remote villages and to introduce another 1,500 police officers into the force. He will ask congress for more money for policing. The eight men were lynched in the village of Xalvaquiej, around 100 miles northwest of Guatemala City. They were stopped at a roadblock as they tried to leave and set on fire. They were said to have been suspected of raping a girl last year and also to have been involved in an attempted kidnapping last weekend. There have been rumours in the villages that children are stolen to be sold for body parts or for Satanic rituals. Those rumours have proved unfounded, but some children have been abducted to be sold and child prostitution in the capital is a serious problem. The lynchings are carried out often by as many as 50 people with the suspects being stoned or hacked to death with machetes. There were 41 such killings reported last year and 50 in 1998.

Western leaders responded with disbelief and incredulity.</p> <p>Born in Lodz, the youngest of eight children, Karski was the son of Stefan Koziel- ewski, the owner of a small tannery and leather goods factory. He was deeply influenced by his mother, Walentyna, a supporter of Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, the revolutionary leader who ruled Poland after the 1926 coup d'etat. The fiercely Catholic Walentyna also imbued Jan with a tolerance for others, particularly for Lodz's large prewar Jewish population.</p> <p>In spite of his mother's political ambitions for him, Karski wanted to become a diplomat. After military service, in 1936 he was sent to the Polish mission in Geneva, where he perfected his French, before going to London in 1937.</p> <p>He returned to Warsaw a year before the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939. A few weeks later, the Soviets invaded from the east, and Karski, by then an artillery officer, was captured and sent to Kozel'- shchina, a Soviet prisoner- of-war camp. He managed to escape, disguised as a private; his fellow Polish officers were massacred at Katyn by the Soviets.</p> <p>Karski's courage, linguistic skills and photographic memory made him a valuable courier in the Polish underground. But in Slovakia, in 1940, he was betrayed, arrested and tortured by the Gestapo. Eventually, after a suicide attempt, he escaped, helped by Polish partisans.</p> <p>Further politicised by his experience at the hands of the Gestapo, Karski was determined to tell the west what was happening to the Jews in Poland. Disguised as a Jew, in 1942 he entered the Warsaw ghetto to witness the horrors he had heard rumoured. Then, disguised as a Latvian guard, he was smuggled into Izbica Lubelska, a concentration camp between Lublin and Belzec, where Jews were robbed before transportation to a death camp. He saw Jews being burned alive in quicklime.</p> <p>By this time Karski had become known as \"Witold\", Poland's most famous courier. Leaders of all political factions - from anti- semitic Polish fascists to those who represented the Polish Jews - trusted him with messages for the Allies.</p> <p>In London in 1942, and in Washington the following year, Karski briefed political and religious leaders, telling them of the extermination of Poland's Jews. But Allied leaders, including the American president, Franklin Roosevelt, reacted with indifference or disbelief. \"Maybe they did not believe, maybe they thought I was exaggerating,\" he said in an interview in 1995.</p> <p>Roosevelt, said Karski, \"did not show any feelings, did not make any comment.\" He told Karski to tell the Poles that the Allies would win the war, and that the criminals would be punished. To Karski, the Allies seemed more concerned with remapping Poland's postwar borders than with the fate of Jews.</p> <p>Alongside Roosevelt at Karski's meeting in Washington were the president's top Jewish advisers, among them Justice Felix Frankfurter, of the US supreme court. Having heard Karski's testimony, he said: \"I am unable to believe you.\" Others, however, appeared to be more convinced. In London, Karski met the Polish emigr\u00e9 artist, Felix Topolski, and Arthur Koestler, then a refugee from Hungary, whose novel, Arrival And Departure, is partly based on Karski's experiences.</p> <p>Karski remained in America and, in 1944, his memoirs, Story Of A Secret State, became a bestseller.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is an unusual sight to observe the chief executive of one of Britain's largest transport companies, FirstGroup, standing outside a smart, suburban school in Baltimore on a bright summer morning waiting for the children to arrive. </p> <p>Moir Lockhead is not there by chance. The reason for his presence becomes apparent as the first of a fleet of 10 yellow school buses, a trusted and important aspect of America's educational system, hoves in to view and carefully deposits its young passengers at the school door. Each one is greeted warmly by the deputy headmistress and bounces off inside. </p> <p>Lockhead is in Baltimore to complete a deal which could make the sturdy yellow bus as familiar a part of the British educational landscape as it is in the United States. </p> <p>A handful of local authorities in Britain already operate them. But most use traditional buses, many of them old, which are not built specially for children. All school buses in the US are custom-built, with yellow and red flashing warning lights, escape routes through the roof, and special safety devices at the front to stop children falling in front of the vehicle. </p> <p>Lockhead says that several local authorities from Scotland to London are ready to sign up to the project. It has the backing of the government because it will help to reduce congestion in large conurbations. In London alone, the Department of Transport says, cars on the school run add 20 minutes to the rush-hour travelling time. </p> <p>From his modest office above a bus garage in Aberdeen, Lockhead runs a rapidly expanding multinational transport undertaking in Britain, the US and Australia, which received its biggest impetus, as did companies such as Stagecoach, when the Tories privatised first the bus industry and then the railways. </p> <p>Apart from school buses, the company has numerous other American interests. These include vehicle repair and maintenance services for the police and fire brigade, and a landmark coach shuttle service designed to improve Washington's heavy congestion. </p> <p>Lockhead is among a handful of executives who have moved seamlessly from the public into the private sector. Having worked tirelessly in the industry for 40 years, his big opportunity came in 1989 when he led a management buyout of the local bus company in Aberdeen for \u00a34.5m. </p> <p>Lockhead says: \"We quickly recognised the need to grow and doubled our size in a matter of years through assiduous acquisition until we were brought to the stock market in 1994. Among the acquisitions were buses in Manchester and Glasgow, and we hit it big when we merged with Badgerline, a group with large interests in the west country.\" </p> <p>Then came the interest in trains, slowly at first but bolstered by the unexpected 25% growth in passenger volume, FirstGroup is now one of the leading players. It operates Great Western from London to the west country and south Wales; North Western, a franchise stretching north and south of Manchester, and Great Eastern services into Liverpool Street. North Western makes a big loss with 1,450 train journeys a day covering 423 stations, whereas Great Eastern makes 650 journeys through only 20 stations, and is in profit. </p> <p>Lockhead, a blunt talker, is critical about the state of the industry. \"We need a new railway out of the old one. We need a new strategy, which is sadly lacking, and we need more investment, which we are not getting. I don't think Railtrack can cope with building a new railway by itself. It does need government help which at the moment it is not getting.\" </p> <p>Lockhead speaks like a man in a hurry. \"We're just about to get the government's 10-year transport plan.

      "bodyText": "It is an unusual sight to observe the chief executive of one of Britain's largest transport companies, FirstGroup, standing outside a smart, suburban school in Baltimore on a bright summer morning waiting for the children to arrive. Moir Lockhead is not there by chance. The reason for his presence becomes apparent as the first of a fleet of 10 yellow school buses, a trusted and important aspect of America's educational system, hoves in to view and carefully deposits its young passengers at the school door. Each one is greeted warmly by the deputy headmistress and bounces off inside. Lockhead is in Baltimore to complete a deal which could make the sturdy yellow bus as familiar a part of the British educational landscape as it is in the United States. A handful of local authorities in Britain already operate them. But most use traditional buses, many of them old, which are not built specially for children. All school buses in the US are custom-built, with yellow and red flashing warning lights, escape routes through the roof, and special safety devices at the front to stop children falling in front of the vehicle. Lockhead says that several local authorities from Scotland to London are ready to sign up to the project. It has the backing of the government because it will help to reduce congestion in large conurbations. In London alone, the Department of Transport says, cars on the school run add 20 minutes to the rush-hour travelling time. From his modest office above a bus garage in Aberdeen, Lockhead runs a rapidly expanding multinational transport undertaking in Britain, the US and Australia, which received its biggest impetus, as did companies such as Stagecoach, when the Tories privatised first the bus industry and then the railways. Apart from school buses, the company has numerous other American interests. These include vehicle repair and maintenance services for the police and fire brigade, and a landmark coach shuttle service designed to improve Washington's heavy congestion. Lockhead is among a handful of executives who have moved seamlessly from the public into the private sector. Having worked tirelessly in the industry for 40 years, his big opportunity came in 1989 when he led a management buyout of the local bus company in Aberdeen for \u00a34.5m. Lockhead says: \"We quickly recognised the need to grow and doubled our size in a matter of years through assiduous acquisition until we were brought to the stock market in 1994. Among the acquisitions were buses in Manchester and Glasgow, and we hit it big when we merged with Badgerline, a group with large interests in the west country.\" Then came the interest in trains, slowly at first but bolstered by the unexpected 25% growth in passenger volume, FirstGroup is now one of the leading players. It operates Great Western from London to the west country and south Wales; North Western, a franchise stretching north and south of Manchester, and Great Eastern services into Liverpool Street. North Western makes a big loss with 1,450 train journeys a day covering 423 stations, whereas Great Eastern makes 650 journeys through only 20 stations, and is in profit. Lockhead, a blunt talker, is critical about the state of the industry. \"We need a new railway out of the old one. We need a new strategy, which is sadly lacking, and we need more investment, which we are not getting. I don't think Railtrack can cope with building a new railway by itself. It does need government help which at the moment it is not getting.\" Lockhead speaks like a man in a hurry. \"We're just about to get the government's 10-year transport plan. But we can't wait 10 years. We need action now.\" The trouble, and Lockhead accepts the point, is that it takes years to turn round a railway which has been starved of investment for decades. Lockhead appears to eat and breathe his job and you can't stop him once he's on a roll. So he's off bashing the franchise \"renewal\" process - under which private train companies have to rebid not only to run the service, but to design the area they would like to run it in. \"It's extremely costly, particularly in the absence of any strategy, and because I don't know how the SSRA (Shadow Strategic Rail Authority) wants to develop the railway.\" While backing Railtrack's claim for more government help, he is angry with the privatised company for its failure to carry out an adequate job. The \u00a35.4bn upgrade of the west coast main line between London and Glasgow is beset with problems. Its cost has more than doubled, and as a train operator, Lockhead is deeply resentful that the upgrade is pushing the loss-making North West Trains even more deeply into the red. He's training his sights on Railtrack. \"Constant and badly planned work, particularly south of Manchester, is making it virtually impossible to operate a satisfactory service and we get it in the neck from our customers.\" Safety warning One of FirstGroup's franchises is Great Western, deeply implicated in the Southall rail crash where no safety warning systems were operating and which might have warned the driver of the impending tragedy. At the more recent Paddington disaster, the Great Western express which collided with a Thames train crossing its path had no chance to stop but was fitted with an advanced warning protection system (ATP). Lockhead says Southall occurred before FirstGroup took over the franchise and that ATP, the most modern safety system on the railway, is installed on every train. He is defensive about the deaths. \"I do not think that these two tragedies were caused by privatisation. In our case, the railway has become more demand led, and we put safety at the top of priorities.

It also has a full listing on the Australian stock exchange. </p> <p><b> OK. But surely all that glisters is not...</b> </p> <p>This time it might be. The worldwide demand for platinum fuel cells has leapt, lifting Aquarius's share price to a record high this month. In this country it is listed on the junior market AIM and is currently at 217.5p compared to 80p six months ago. </p> <p>A fuel cell battery for mobile phones has just been unveiled and cars are increasingly being manufactured with platinum catalysts. General Motors has recently issued a statement reiterating its commitment to use platinum instead of palladium in its vehicles. </p> <p>Even more exciting for investors, platinum fuel cells are now being developed which could eventually replace the car's combustion engine. Daimler Benz, Ford and GM all plan to use these cells on the production line from 2003. Emerging markets are also using more platinum. </p> <p>Platinum jewellery sales are shooting up - in 1999 by 68% in the UK and 53% in China, and last year demand for the metal exceeded supply by 730,000 ounces. The platinum price is now at a record high. </p> <p>For more information on the metal check out the Platinum Metal's Review's website at <a href=\"http://www.platinum.matthey.com/publications/pmr.html\" target=\"_NEW\">www.platinum.matthey.com/publications/pmr.html</a>. </p> <p><b> And is Aquarius well placed to take advantage of this?</b> </p> <p>This week, the company announced it has secured its third mining project, Everest South. This should be in production by 2002, and when it is, it will be Aquarius's largest mine yet. Aquarius has also just commenced production at a new mine in South Africa - Kroondal - two months ahead of schedule. When this mine reaches peak capacity, it will be churning out 100,000 ounces (metrication has evidently not yet reached the mining world) of platinum and 50,000 ounces of palladium a year. </p> <p>It has also received very positive results from a feasibility study on another mine - Marikana, which is also in South Africa. The mine could contribute up to $72m in gross revenues. </p> <p><b> What about the competition?</b> </p> <p>It is a small market, but those competitors that there are, are also doing very well. Anglo American Platinum, Impala Platinum and Northern Platinum are the biggest, and their share prices have risen 72%, 114% and 74% respectively, over the past few months. </p> <p>Impala, the world's second largest platinum producer, is also Aquarius' biggest shareholder. </p> <p><b> So what does the City say?</b> </p> <p>Share price estimates range from \u00a310 in the medium term to \u00a33 in the short term. Its London brokers are Williams de Broe. </p> <p><b> And what do the small investors think?</b> </p> <p>The bulletin boards are a'buzzin - not surprising, as it is a very sexy sector at the moment. But remember, a lot of what is said in the unregulated cyber lounges is misleading, deceptive or just plain wrong. </p> <p>Maurillac, writing on the Hemscott board, says: \"I was going to get some, but my bank manager recommended them - put me right off!\" </p> <p>Another, more serious, chatter writes: \"Rumour is that more expansion is to come (within three weeks). This looks a pretty good share to me.\" </p> <p>Robur on UK-iNvest's board says: \"The chart is not a buy or sell at the moment, though the huge increases in volume suggests that the price probably will break out and then become a definite buy. I would watch it very closely over the next few days.\" </p> <p>Those Citytipsters (remember them? the group emailing anonymous, but generally accurate, share information to select people, in order, presumably, to see the value of their holdings go up) are understandably keen. </p> <p>They say: \"This week, we believe we have found one of the most exciting stocks, with a solid past performance and huge upward momentum. Aquarius has recently sprinted ahead to reach a closing price of 213p. At this current price, our research shows there is plenty of distance left to run and the target is \u00a310.\"</p>",

A fuel cell battery for mobile phones has just been unveiled and cars are increasingly being manufactured with platinum catalysts. General Motors has recently issued a statement reiterating its commitment to use platinum instead of palladium in its vehicles. Even more exciting for investors, platinum fuel cells are now being developed which could eventually replace the car's combustion engine. Daimler Benz, Ford and GM all plan to use these cells on the production line from 2003. Emerging markets are also using more platinum. Platinum jewellery sales are shooting up - in 1999 by 68% in the UK and 53% in China, and last year demand for the metal exceeded supply by 730,000 ounces. The platinum price is now at a record high. For more information on the metal check out the Platinum Metal's Review's website at www.platinum.matthey.com/publications/pmr.html. And is Aquarius well placed to take advantage of this? This week, the company announced it has secured its third mining project, Everest South. This should be in production by 2002, and when it is, it will be Aquarius's largest mine yet. Aquarius has also just commenced production at a new mine in South Africa - Kroondal - two months ahead of schedule. When this mine reaches peak capacity, it will be churning out 100,000 ounces (metrication has evidently not yet reached the mining world) of platinum and 50,000 ounces of palladium a year. It has also received very positive results from a feasibility study on another mine - Marikana, which is also in South Africa. The mine could contribute up to $72m in gross revenues. What about the competition? It is a small market, but those competitors that there are, are also doing very well. Anglo American Platinum, Impala Platinum and Northern Platinum are the biggest, and their share prices have risen 72%, 114% and 74% respectively, over the past few months. Impala, the world's second largest platinum producer, is also Aquarius' biggest shareholder. So what does the City say? Share price estimates range from \u00a310 in the medium term to \u00a33 in the short term. Its London brokers are Williams de Broe. And what do the small investors think? The bulletin boards are a'buzzin - not surprising, as it is a very sexy sector at the moment. But remember, a lot of what is said in the unregulated cyber lounges is misleading, deceptive or just plain wrong. Maurillac, writing on the Hemscott board, says: \"I was going to get some, but my bank manager recommended them - put me right off!\" Another, more serious, chatter writes: \"Rumour is that more expansion is to come (within three weeks). This looks a pretty good share to me.\" Robur on UK-iNvest's board says: \"The chart is not a buy or sell at the moment, though the huge increases in volume suggests that the price probably will break out and then become a definite buy. I would watch it very closely over the next few days.\" Those Citytipsters (remember them? the group emailing anonymous, but generally accurate, share information to select people, in order, presumably, to see the value of their holdings go up) are understandably keen. They say: \"This week, we believe we have found one of the most exciting stocks, with a solid past performance and huge upward momentum. Aquarius has recently sprinted ahead to reach a closing price of 213p. At this current price, our research shows there is plenty of distance left to run and the target is \u00a310.\"",

There were only 90 seats. It was a small audience but we were nervous, because we always are - but not as twitchy as we were last month when we made our debut at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester. </p> <p>At rather than in: we were not actually on the wide platform where Barenboim has conducted and Kissin played; instead we sang in the foyer as patrons arrived for a Hall\u00e9 orchestra summer prom featuring bleeding chunks from choral masterpieces. As the big night approached, I had this ludicrous daydream that our performance would be so sensational the audience would demand the Hall\u00e9 choir should shove off and let us do the second half of the gig. </p> <p>It didn't happen. We were, after all, only the warm-up act: 40 minutes before the concert, 15 minutes at half-time. We sang as as concert-goers turned up to buy programmes, order drinks, eat Magnums, chat to friends, find the loos. We had chosen our programme carefully to suit the venue. We had dusted off a piece appropriately named Bridgewater, and also gave what these days is called a site-specific performance. The hall has a great glass prow jutting out over its entrance and that's where we sang: prow made us think of ships, ships of Titanic, and Titanic of Nearer my God to Thee, the great hymn played by bandmaster Wallace Hartley and his men as the liner slid beneath the icy waters of the Atlantic. </p> <p>When we started, no one else was there. Then a few concert-goers turned up but pretended we weren't there. Then some stopped to listen; there was even some applause. This event was the big time, the high-point in the career of the Grace Darling Singers, founded in 1990 to sing a bizarre repertoire mainly for fun. </p> <p>It was all my idea, a bit of folly begun by someone who can't sight read, hasn't got perfect pitch, can't breathe properly and failed O-level music with 38%. I wrote a piece for a local arts magazine inviting interest from anyone who wanted to do something a bit different from the output of the average choral society. About a dozen strangers (plus press-ganged friends) turned up and sang in my dining room while Emily, the late black and white cat, yowled. Our neighbour said the singing sounded heavenly as it drifted through her wall. </p> <p>The first thing we did was the Grace Darling Song, a Victorian ballad celebrating the brave woman who helped rescue the crew of the stricken vessel Forfarshire. That song gave us our name and we adopted as our banner a dramatic portrait of Grace pulling on her oars. (It's a very nice tea towel, a souvenir from the Grace Darling Museum in Bamburgh.) Next, to cheer ourselves up, we sang a dirge called Peat Bog Soldiers, written during the Spanish civil war, and then I think we did Throw Out The Lifeline, a ballad in praise of temperance. </p> <p>We have met monthly and settled into a specialised repertoire: church music in England and America from 1750 to 1850, written by local composers for their own choirs, the kind of music sung by the Mellstock Quire in Thomas Hardy's Under The Greenwood Tree. </p> <p>Almost everything we do has been dug out and edited from long-neglected manuscripts and books by our musical director, who is doing a PhD in this stuff and knows about keys, cadences and contemporary performance practice. We have sung the hymns and psalms of James Leach of Rochdale, Richard Taylor of Chester, John Beaumont of Macclesfield, Daniel Read of Attleboro, Mass, Supply Belcher of Stoughton (Mass again), and JJ Stone of nowhere in particular. </p> <p>We have a particular affection for a tune called Gilgal by Blind Billy Lonsdale of Bolton, a talented multi-instrumentalist who was kicked out of his church when he played a jig instead of a solemn melody at a Sunday morning service after a boozy Saturday night. And we have a kind of discreet passion for the work of William Billings of Boston, an incredibly ugly tanner who, a century and a half before Charles Ives, wrote American music that dances with delight and eccentricity. </p> <p>I'd go so far as to boast that the Grace Darlings are leading the British celebrations marking the 200th anniversary this year of Billings's death. If the Hall\u00e9 audience didn't take to his Rose of Sharon it would have stood condemned for its cloth ears. And yet, although we hit the big time with the Bridgewater (as we did when we recorded Sunday Half Hour for Radio 2), it's the small times we seem to enjoy most. </p> <p>There was that night in south Manchester when we invited the audience to join us in a couple of numbers (including one of the earliest tunes for While Shepherds Watched; it's now better known as On Ilkley Moor Baht 'At) and heard this wondrous wall of Methodist sound coming at us. </p> <p>We've sung three times to a cotton mill's massive steam engine in Oldham, and tried to stay in three-four time when a stoker was shovelling coal in four-four. We've hired a boat called the Grace Darling at Stratford, cruised down the Avon and frightened the wits out of passengers on the chain ferry by singing Nearer My God To Thee. </p> <p>We've walked across fields on sunny summer days to sing for ourselves in lonely churches: one in Warwickshire was at the heart of a deserted medieval village; the other, in Cheshire, had a fine horse-drawn hearse which we serenaded with a funeral hymn from Shropshire. </p> <p> But perhaps the best day was a trip to the beautiful church of St Lawrence above Rushton Spencer, near Leek in Staffordshire, where old Uriah Davenport taught and led his singers for 60 years until his death at 94 in 1784. If you go up to the gallery, you can find Uriah's initials picked out in studs on a bench. We went there to sing some of his own music at a Sunday service, and included his setting of Psalm 150, the one that goes on about praising the Lord with all kinds of instruments. The piece has its fair number of tricks, and the tenors have to pretend to be trumpets and the basses to be droning bagpipes. </p> <p>We were quite nervous. The tenors suspended all movement in an attempt to avoid provoking distressing creaks from a bench which was beginning to flag after 250 years' loyal service. A thrush was singing sweetly in a tree which may have been around to tremble on September 14 1777, when an earthquake shook Rushton, throwing the congregation into great confusion. Perhaps Uriah's singers trembled too, and perhaps terror made them sing all the better; it usually works with us. </p> <p>One of the joys of singing this kind of music is that just occasionally there is a time slip and you find yourself becoming at one with those 18th century singers who struggled to learn a piece which took them to the edge of their collective ability and sometimes beyond. We share their anxieties and tribulations, the lows when there is a cock-up, the adrenalin-drenched highs when we reach for something beyond the mere notes. </p> <p>We sang Davenport's Psalm 150 at the Bridgewater in almost certainly its first Manchester performance. We hope the prom-goers enjoyed it (especially the bit where the tenors gargle like trumpets) but we would't have minded if they didn't. Last week, marking our own anniversary, we were back in the small time.</p>",

Ms Phillips and Ms Blackman were educated at the same private school, worked for the same airline and, after flying to Tokyo together, shared an apartment and took jobs at the same hostess bar, the Casablanca.</p> <p>Although Ms Phillips could leave Japan at any time, she has chosen to stay and assist in the police inquiries. \"The police told me that if I go home they have got nothing to go on. When I heard that, I was determined to stay.\"</p> <p>Other lines of investigation appear to be yielding few positive results. Police have distributed 30,000 leaflets appealing for help in Roppongi and around the area where the two women lived.</p> <p>Toshihiko Mii, deputy superintendent of the Azabu police station, said, however, that there had been only 47 responses, none of which appeared promising.</p> <p>Yesterday, detectives interviewed the Casablanca bar manager, Tetsuo Nishi.</p> <p>Police have also taken copies of the bar's records of customer orders and out-of-hours dates. The Casablanca is known to push its hostesses to meet clients outside the bar. These \"dohan\" dates generate a large share of the bar's income.</p> <p>Police are investigating the possibility that Ms Blackman was abducted by a customer while on a dohan.</p> <p>A police spokesman said that detectives have not interviewed other hostesses at the Casablanca, nor a boyfriend that Tim Blackman, Lucie's father, mentioned to them on Thursday.</p> <p>\"We don't know who he is or where he is,\" said Mr Mii.</p> <p>In an attempt to generate new leads, Mr Cook held an impromptu press conference yesterday after meeting Mr Blackman during a brief stop in Tokyo.</p> <p>The foreign secretary said: \"I would ask those in Japan who may have some information to reflect on the pain and the distress that this is causing Mr Blackman and his family.</p> <p>\"I have expressed the concern of the British government over the disappearance of Lucie.\"</p>",

Detectives questioned Louise Phillips for the fifth consecutive day yesterday as the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, appealed to the Japanese public for information on the whereabouts of Ms Blackman, who has been missing for two weeks. The 21-year-old former British Airways stewardess disappeared after going on an afternoon date with a man, who is believed to have been a customer at the hostess bar she worked at in the Roppongi entertainment district of Tokyo. Two days later, Ms Phillips received a phone call from a man claiming that her friend had joined a religious cult in Chiba, an area just east of Tokyo. \"You'll never see her again,\" he said. Detectives and Ms Blackman's father suspect that this call was a hoax, but with few solid leads suggesting any clear alternatives, investigators have asked Ms Phillips to go over what happened again and again. \"It has been the worst time of my life,\" Ms Phillips said. \"The police are not treating me as a suspect, but I seem to be all they have to go on.\" Every day this week, Ms Phillips has spent 10 to 12 hours at the Azabu police station, where she has been interviewed by up to five detec tives through an interpreter. Ms Phillips and Ms Blackman were educated at the same private school, worked for the same airline and, after flying to Tokyo together, shared an apartment and took jobs at the same hostess bar, the Casablanca. Although Ms Phillips could leave Japan at any time, she has chosen to stay and assist in the police inquiries. \"The police told me that if I go home they have got nothing to go on. When I heard that, I was determined to stay.\" Other lines of investigation appear to be yielding few positive results. Police have distributed 30,000 leaflets appealing for help in Roppongi and around the area where the two women lived. Toshihiko Mii, deputy superintendent of the Azabu police station, said, however, that there had been only 47 responses, none of which appeared promising. Yesterday, detectives interviewed the Casablanca bar manager, Tetsuo Nishi. Police have also taken copies of the bar's records of customer orders and out-of-hours dates. The Casablanca is known to push its hostesses to meet clients outside the bar. These \"dohan\" dates generate a large share of the bar's income. Police are investigating the possibility that Ms Blackman was abducted by a customer while on a dohan. A police spokesman said that detectives have not interviewed other hostesses at the Casablanca, nor a boyfriend that Tim Blackman, Lucie's father, mentioned to them on Thursday. \"We don't know who he is or where he is,\" said Mr Mii. In an attempt to generate new leads, Mr Cook held an impromptu press conference yesterday after meeting Mr Blackman during a brief stop in Tokyo. The foreign secretary said: \"I would ask those in Japan who may have some information to reflect on the pain and the distress that this is causing Mr Blackman and his family. \"I have expressed the concern of the British government over the disappearance of Lucie.\"",

But last week I saw one, large as life, being eaten in the centre of Wigan - a 'Wigan Butty', which is a pie inside a buttered barm cake!\" More news from Wigan Harry Potter sold 372,775 copies in its first few days, compared to only 3,855 sales of The Redemption Of Althalus, number two in the hardback bestseller list. The tenth is Gemini, by Dorothy Dunnett, which sold just 383 - one copy for every 1,000 Harry Potters. It must be the greatest gap ever in the top 10. I guessed one reason from chatting to James Naughtie at the Today programme party, held in the rain in the Chelsea Physic Garden. He had acquired copies for each of his three children, who were being visited by two cousins, each of whom had copies: \"Our house was like the Athenaeum reading room for the whole weekend.\"",

People are beginning to learn.

Because it is often shortened to Ali, it might be assumed to be Alistair. It is not. Alistair Campbell is a cricketer who plays for Zimbabwe, and I dare say the phone will ring in a moment with a claim that he once made 296 not out while batting in Rutland. </p> <p>I now have my own mnemonic: \"Alastair Campbell, alas\". But if Labour is really determined to rid itself of media backbiting, it should bring in a law to clarify the issue. It could order, for instance, that those in this class employed in the government service must be Alastairs, and all the rest must be Alistairs. I dare say the Commons would swiftly pass an emergency bill to give this effect, though the Lords might give trouble. I weep for them. </p> <p> The other day I stopped for a drink in Slaidburn, Lancashire, at a pub called the Hark to Bounty. This pub was once called The Dog. The local rector, a man called Wigglesworth, had a hound called Bounty which he used to tie up outside this inn when he called for a drink. One day this dog barked so imperiously for its walk to be resumed that the rector exclaimed: \"Hark to Bounty!\"; whereupon it was decided, for reasons inexplicable in our own allegedly more rational century, that this should become the name of the pub. </p> <p>Was the local MP asked to intervene? Were questions raised in parliament? Was the minister for culture, the media and sport incited to make a statement? Of course not. But nowadays if the Lansdowne pub in Cheltenham dares to alter its name to the Dog 'n' Do'nut, huge ululations arise, from Tory MPs especially. These are people who over the years have grinningly condoned the deaths of great industries; who endlessly squawk against the depredations of what they vibrantly term \"the nanny state\"; who can rarely get through an innings of 295 not out without repeatedly uttering the parrot cry \"get government off our backs\". Yet let the brewers decide that, to keep the Rose and Crown viable, they will have to alter its name to the Vole and Vibrator, and the cry goes up for government intervention to halt such a filthy practice.

A man called John Morgan, who died in awful circumstances this week, used to write a weekly column in the Times telling people how to behave. I hated his stuff, not least because of his ruling that a man committed a solecism whenever he used use blue ink, but I'm sorry that he is dead.

      "body": "<p> Orangemen on their marches and Israeli parliamentarians afraid that Ehud Barak will concede too much to Palestinians at Camp David this week prompt reflection on the nature and place of compromise in human affairs. In particular, they remind us of a familiar but profound fact that explains the vexed character of moral debate: there are almost always at least two diametrically different ways of seeing the same thing, depending on the point of view. </p> <p>Thus the inability or unwillingness to compromise is intransigence or steadfastness, according to which end of the moral telescope you look through. An Orangeman will appeal to his principles, his traditions, his rights and the threats to all three in justifying what to outsiders seems his obduracy, his pig-headedness and his prejudices. </p> <p>Moral skill is the ability to distinguish which is which. The risks of failing to compromise in any matter, great or small, scarcely need mention. An Italian proverb points out that it is preferable to lose the saddle than the horse, and Nikita Khrushchev, on whom the lessons of daily Soviet life were never wasted, famously remarked that \"if you cannot catch a bird of paradise, better take a wet hen\". </p> <p>These wise acceptances mark the limit of compromise, which at its best should be satisfying to both parties, giving each the pleasure of believing that he has got more than he ought to have, while being deprived of nothing that is justly his own. The good negotiator aims to send both parties away believing that they have achieved this outcome by their own cleverness. </p> <p>Whether compromise is appropriate is entirely a matter of what is at stake. Between nations and states accommodation is rarely impossible, and it is almost always better than tariff war or shooting war. But the liberal democracies were right not to compromise with Hitler, and it is a tragedy that they now too often compromise with tyrants morally indistinguishable from Hitler. </p> <p>In many cases it is not difficult to decide whether to compromise, and the truth is that western governments do it too often, always with the aim of saving money and trouble at home, no matter how much cost in human agony is exacted abroad. And when difficult cases come, it is the mark of a mature political comity that it makes no compromises over the task of judging, nor over acting with resolve if required. </p> <p>In private life, compromise is both a saviour and the destroyer. Obviously enough, no one can sustain a relationship without accommodating the other's character and some at least of his or her needs and ways. It means negotiation, always in the hope of constructive and mutually satisfactory adjustment. But the truism that people change over time is so often forgotten in relationships that failure, if it happens, comes as a surprise to the parties, who have missed their opportunities to renegotiate the old contract when new compromises were needed. </p> <p>At the same time, too many relationships are premised on large compromises made by just one party. Traditionally it was women who made them, giving up whole-life possibilities to care for small children or elderly parents. Often the compromise concerns disparities in sexual interest, one party having to suffocate needs because the other fails to satisfy them - or to express them in such socially disapproved ways as adultery or resort to prostitutes, each itself a compromise that history and society have together reached as a way of containing the volcanic power of sex. </p> <p>Most insidious of all is the compromise an individual makes with himself when ambitions begin to falter, and he begins to \"accept his limitations\" - a phrase that far more often denotes retreat and weariness in the face of failure than a just discernment of powers. Unamuno said that we are all potentially heroes and geniuses, if only we would have the courage and do the hard work necessary to becoming so. Perhaps - here finding the exception to Burke's rule - the one compromise we should never make is with life. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Orangemen on their marches and Israeli parliamentarians afraid that Ehud Barak will concede too much to Palestinians at Camp David this week prompt reflection on the nature and place of compromise in human affairs. In particular, they remind us of a familiar but profound fact that explains the vexed character of moral debate: there are almost always at least two diametrically different ways of seeing the same thing, depending on the point of view. Thus the inability or unwillingness to compromise is intransigence or steadfastness, according to which end of the moral telescope you look through. An Orangeman will appeal to his principles, his traditions, his rights and the threats to all three in justifying what to outsiders seems his obduracy, his pig-headedness and his prejudices. Moral skill is the ability to distinguish which is which. The risks of failing to compromise in any matter, great or small, scarcely need mention. An Italian proverb points out that it is preferable to lose the saddle than the horse, and Nikita Khrushchev, on whom the lessons of daily Soviet life were never wasted, famously remarked that \"if you cannot catch a bird of paradise, better take a wet hen\". These wise acceptances mark the limit of compromise, which at its best should be satisfying to both parties, giving each the pleasure of believing that he has got more than he ought to have, while being deprived of nothing that is justly his own. The good negotiator aims to send both parties away believing that they have achieved this outcome by their own cleverness. Whether compromise is appropriate is entirely a matter of what is at stake. Between nations and states accommodation is rarely impossible, and it is almost always better than tariff war or shooting war. But the liberal democracies were right not to compromise with Hitler, and it is a tragedy that they now too often compromise with tyrants morally indistinguishable from Hitler. In many cases it is not difficult to decide whether to compromise, and the truth is that western governments do it too often, always with the aim of saving money and trouble at home, no matter how much cost in human agony is exacted abroad. And when difficult cases come, it is the mark of a mature political comity that it makes no compromises over the task of judging, nor over acting with resolve if required. In private life, compromise is both a saviour and the destroyer. Obviously enough, no one can sustain a relationship without accommodating the other's character and some at least of his or her needs and ways. It means negotiation, always in the hope of constructive and mutually satisfactory adjustment. But the truism that people change over time is so often forgotten in relationships that failure, if it happens, comes as a surprise to the parties, who have missed their opportunities to renegotiate the old contract when new compromises were needed. At the same time, too many relationships are premised on large compromises made by just one party. Traditionally it was women who made them, giving up whole-life possibilities to care for small children or elderly parents. Often the compromise concerns disparities in sexual interest, one party having to suffocate needs because the other fails to satisfy them - or to express them in such socially disapproved ways as adultery or resort to prostitutes, each itself a compromise that history and society have together reached as a way of containing the volcanic power of sex. Most insidious of all is the compromise an individual makes with himself when ambitions begin to falter, and he begins to \"accept his limitations\" - a phrase that far more often denotes retreat and weariness in the face of failure than a just discernment of powers. Unamuno said that we are all potentially heroes and geniuses, if only we would have the courage and do the hard work necessary to becoming so. Perhaps - here finding the exception to Burke's rule - the one compromise we should never make is with life.",

Fewer still will have ever seen one. And before this week it was all but impossible that anyone younger than the Queen Mother could have attended a performance of Sousa's final stage work, The Glass Blowers, which was premiered in 1913 and which has not been performed anywhere for 85 years. </p> <p>The challenge of resuscitating Sousa's period piece is the kind of challenge in which the Glimmerglass opera company revels. Throughout its quarter century of existence this resourceful company has regularly tapped into a rich vein of old and new American opera, which it performs at Cooperstown in upstate New York. The latest results, unveiled at the start of this year's 25th anniversary season last week, must surely rank as one of the most successful initiatives yet at Glimmerglass. </p> <p>The Glass Blowers is definitely not an undiscovered masterpiece. Musically, the material is at times astonishingly thin. It feels like almost half an hour before the score shades off into a minor key. But Sousa was a neat orchestrator, had a professional's touch for a jaunty two-step and a lilting waltz, and when it comes to a foot-tapping march he has few equals in musical history. It is no surprise that you emerge from a performance of The Glass Blowers humming the recurring march tune that the composer later adapted as From Maine to Oregon. </p> <p>As Jonathan Miller showed in his ENO Mikado production, period operetta will struggle to retain a modern audience's attention for long without the intercession of a radical, confident and intelligent directorial hand. In just such a way, the saviour of The Glass Blowers is Christopher Alden, whose direction transforms Sousa's jumble of banality and bluster into one of the most undemandingly enjoyable theatrical nights imaginable. </p> <p>For me, the biggest surprise was not that the piece exists at all, or that it was worth a hearing, but that it is so chock full of oddly compelling dialogue about such subjects as women's rights, the industrial class struggle and the rise of American imperialism. This is not to suggest that Sousa's tale of romantic entanglements among early 20th century New York high life is what one could call a serious work, still less a serious political work. But it is nevertheless unambiguously set in the US of robber-baron capitalists, exploited immigrant industrial workers, and the Spanish-American war of 1898. These settings help to generate some lines that you don't often get the chance of hearing in the opera house. </p> <p>The workers' chorus, \"My love is a blower, and he loves only me\" had Glimmerglass's post-Lewinsky audience rolling in the aisles. The officer's lament over his sleeping soldiers, \"I can't get 'em up in the morning\" had everyone guffawing again. An aria in praise of the Red Cross, another one in favour of trade union brotherhood, and a duet about the difficulties of getting by \"on 10,000 a year\", mean that the reconstructed libretto of this operatic disinterment is an unusually interesting one. </p> <p>Glimmerglass pulled out the stops for The Glass Blowers, with plenty of rehearsal time allowing Alden to mould a performance whose effervescent gaiety was based on strict theatrical and aesthetic discipline. In conformity with its traditions, most of the roles were taken by young singers, among whom Maria Kanyova as the feminist heiress Annabelle Vandeveer stood out, as did the Walsall-born baritone Richard Whitehouse as the Duke of Branford. </p> <p>In a programme note to mark the company's 25th anniversary, company music director Stewart Robertson writes that Glimmerglass has always tried to encourage a style of singing that is \"open, unmannered, bright and confident\". Those qualities were also very much in evidence in the opening night performance of La Boh\u00e8me, the first work ever performed at Glimmerglass in 1975, in a new production that Robertson himself conducted with great sympathy for his singers. James Robinson's new production deftly transposed the settings forward to first world war Paris. Impressively, as in the Glass Blowers, the historical awareness of the production never came between the work and the audience. </p> <p>Glimmerglass has now firmly established itself in a purpose-built countryside opera theatre of an almost ideal size (it seats around 900 people). Its summer seasons focus on early opera (Handel's Acis and Galatea this year) and American works, with a core of sure-fire staples like Boh\u00e8me and Salom\u00e9, all of which are mounted in new productions. With the company's former general manager Paul Kellogg now installed as head of the New York City Opera, there is a firm convention that the productions that first see the light of day in Glimmerglass will then move to Manhattan within the next year or so.

      "body": "<p>It is a glorious thing when Gary Sinise demonstrates the curious, tilting snarl that he affectionately calls \"the sneer.\" First the head flicks back and the eyelids droop, an expression epitomising the concept of self-absorbed, somnolent cool. Then, as the upper lip curls, his sleek, sturdy features disintegrate into a combination of defiant faux- confidence and adolescent uncertainty. </p> <p>In its tentative swagger, there are overtones of James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause and a hint of the young Paul Newman of The Hustler. For just a few moments, in a corner of the cosy Italian restaurant across the road from the Steppenwolf main auditorium in Chicago, Gary Sinise becomes what he once was: \"a young punk, experimenting with all kinds of stuff, lashing out at authority\". </p> <p>This is precisely how drama teacher Barbara Patterson, now 70, first encountered the 16-year-old Sinise in a corridor of Highland Park high school in spring 1971: \"I was going down this hallway,\" she recalls, \"it was where some of the ne'er-do-wells hung out. Then I saw these guys, leaning against the wall, looking like gang members. We were doing the school musical and I said: 'you look like you stepped out of West Side Story'. I particularly looked at Gary, who seemed to be the leader and was sneering the hardest, and said: 'You look like you could be a Shark or a Jet. I want to see you at auditions this afternoon'.\" </p> <p>It would prove a fateful encounter, one that would eventually become central to the mythology of one of America's greatest theatre ensemble: Chicago's Steppenwolf. Founded in a tiny church basement of his home Chicago suburb of Highland Park by Sinise and his high school friend Jeff Perry and Terry Kinney, the company had soon forged a distinctive style of performance of such physicality, intensity and emotional force that it left front-row audience members fearing for both their own and the actors' safety. </p> <p>Blessed with brute talent, the company launched many outstanding screen careers, including those of John Malkovich, Joan Allen, Kevin Anderson, Laurie Metcalf (Roseanne's sister), John Mahoney (Frasier's father), and Sinise himself. Now approaching its 25th anniversary, Steppenwolf is mentioned by critics in the same breath as US legends such as the Group Theatre - from the 30s - and New York's Circle Repertory. Variety magazine calls it \"the country's foremost actors' theatre\". \"A name synonymous with a visceral acting style full of raw passion,\" said Playbill magazine, \"the uncompromising, in-your-face school of acting dubbed 'rock'n'roll theatre'.\" </p> <p>The hallway confrontation between the drama teacher and the posturing youth would leave an equally profound, life-long impression on Sinise himself. An academic malcontent who left school barely able to read, he went on to become artistic director of Steppenwolf in the early 80s, initiating much that established the company nationally and internationally. Equally impressive for someone with minimal formal education, he went on to direct some of the company's most successful shows, including the 1982 production of Sam Shepard's True West which propelled John Malkovich to stardom, and the 1996 revival of Buried Child, which earned Sinise a Tony nomination. On screen, in 1992, he directed a masterly adaptation of Steinbeck's Of Mice And Men. </p> <p>Only as he was approaching his forties did Sinise belatedly and remarkably - given his age - establish himself as a major movie actor, with roles in Forrest Gump (for which he received an Oscar nomination), Apollo 13, Ransom, and Mission To Mars. Along the way, he has earned the devotion of his directors: \"When I worked with John Gielgud or with Richard Burton it was the same thing,\" says John Frankenheimer, who directed Sinise's Emmy-winning performance in the TV movie George Wallace, \"his choices are 100% right. Gary Sinise is, quite simply, a great actor. If I had my way, I'd have him in all my movies.\" </p> <p>In person, Sinise is fiercely down-to-earth and unpretentious. In his tatty jeans and scruffy baseball cap, he might slip by unnoticed were it not for that face, still unnaturally youthful at 45, classically American in its full proportions, and shot through with the na\u00efve masculinity that has often marked out Hollywood leading men. Despite moving to Malibu in California in the late 80s, he retains every syrupy nuance of his Chicago accent - a slow methodical drawl so meticulously polite in that peculiar old-fashioned mid-western manner that you'd almost expect him to suffix every sentence with \"ma'am\" or \"sir\". </p> <p>He's self-effacing: \"I have simple tastes, simple desires. If you are going to try to dig out complex or contradictory strands, you're wasting your time.\" He still credits Barbara Patterson as the reason why all this happened and is in regular contact with his old mentor. However, as implied by his uncanny ability to play villains (Ransom, Snake Eyes) as well as all-American heroes, beneath the boyish exterior is a tension that hints at more. </p> <p>\"He has honesty, vulnerability and humour but a character underneath which can turn to menace quite easily,\" says director Ron Howard, in a comment that could apply as neatly to his character as his acting, \"it's a kind of straightforward, working-class, 'feet planted on the ground' quality that at the same time says: 'you better stay out of my way'.\" </p> <p>It is no surprise that Sinise is avidly anti-intellectual, a man who, even now, finds reading difficult: \"I have friends who could start a book at six and finish it by midnight,\" he says, shaking his head, \"I simply can't understand that. I wish I could read all those Tolstoy books and go through Joyce but I just can't. I'm still a very slow reader.\" At Steppenwolf, his aversion to all things literary has become something of a running gag: \"We used to joke, even when Gary was artistic director,\" says Laurie Metcalf, \"that he only ever read the plays that he was in.\" </p> <p>Instead of any intellectual gloss, what Sinise delivers is pure passion. Even in conversation, it washes over him in great waves: \"Theatre to me is for the gut, it's for the heart. That's what I get off on. I'm not a theorist. I'm not into intellectual masturbation. All I want is a simple reaction to the feeling of what is happening onstage, a visceral, gut reaction.\" In certain circumstances, it is easy to see how this untutored ardour might work to his disadvantage: \"He bulls his way through a lot of situations and doesn't always show huge compassion for people,\" says Steppenwolf co-founder Terry Kinney. \"If he feels something should happen, everyone else will be forced to make way.\" </p> <p>His \"spontaneity\" has probably contributed to a turbulent personal life: his 19-year marriage to Steppenwolf ensemble co-member Moira Harris has endured numerous affairs and separations: \"We've weathered many, many storms,\" Sinise says, \"Many times it was questionable where we were going.\" But as most original Steppenwolf members will agree, it was this same ferocious zeal and sometimes blind commitment that held the troupe together when they were playing to single-figure audiences in a cramped basement: \"Gary always had the strongest vision of the group,\" remembers Metcalf. \"For some of us it was just sort of a summer fling. But for Gary it was always more than that. It was obviously what he wanted to do with his life. </p> <p>\"He had a whole reserve of passion stored up because he wasn't really putting it anywhere else. This gave him all the energy and fearlessness to move us ahead. \" Ultimately, he forced them to believe, in what at the time must have seemed to outsiders as monumental folly or conceit, that they were a great company, and as Sinise commented at the time to his mother \"some day, all the world will know\". </p> <p>Gary Alan Sinise was born in the quiet suburb of Blue Island, Illinois, about 20 miles south of downtown Chicago on the March 17 1955, first child of Millie (nee Alsip) and Robert L Sinise, a film editor who, early in his career, specialised in C-Grade horror flicks such as Blood Feast and Two Thousand Maniacs!. \"I remember as a kid going down to the editing room,\" Gary says, \"and my Dad would be working. I remember being five years old looking at these slasher movies of my dad, all this blood, chainsaws and screaming.\" </p> <p>When Gary was nine, the family moved to Highland Park, the cluster of dormitory estates 30 miles north of downtown Chicago on the shores of Lake Michigan where life was for the most part \"very normal and suburban\", says Robert Sinise. Gary and his younger brother Randy played football. Sister Lori was a cheerleader. However, almost from the moment he began school, Gary showed, \"no interest at all in academic studies\", according to his mother. By the time he reached Highland Park High in 1970 he was the picture of disaffected, rebellious youth: long-haired, leather-wearing, dope-smoking and playing in grungy garage bands with names like Uproot Confusion, The Olde Molde and Dirty Brain. \"I wanted to be Hendrix,\" he says, \"I used to play guitar with my teeth.\" </p> <p>Already written off by teachers as hopeless by the time Barbara Patterson collared him, Sinise was skipping classes and had had a brush with the law \"for a pot-related offence\". But then, in the great tradition of greasepaint epiphany, everything changed. After showing up at the West Side Story audition, simply out of curiosity, he landed the role of the Shark Pepe - \"about two lines and a lot of strutting around\". By the last night of the production, any scepticism had melted away and Sinise was hooked. </p> <p>\"One of the kids in the show brought him up front for the bow,\" says Barbara Patterson, \"He was in tears. It was a moment of intense bonding for him, not just with theatre but with what he wanted to be.\" Equally importantly, it was at the audition that he first met Steppenwolf co-founder Jeff Perry, who was cast against him as Jet: \"We were the odd couple,\" remembers Perry, \"I was in glasses that were slightly larger than the rest of my entire head and he was in a leather vest. He was a rock star and I was what would now be considered a computer nerd. But we hit it off and soon we were inseparable.\" </p> <p>While Perry moved on to study theatre at Illinois State University, where he met the final member of the original Steppenwolf triumvirate, Terry Kinney, Sinise stayed behind in high school, needing an extra six months to complete his diploma. On graduation in 1974, he converted a local Unitarian church into a stopgap theatre and gathered a group of high school friends to form a company, naming it after the Herman Hesse novel that happened to be lying around. Among the first Steppenwolf productions was the musical Grease, which Perry and Kinney travelled from university to see in June 1974: \"They had lights made out of old coffee tins,\" Kinney remembers, \"a makeshift lighting board and costumes out of the junkyard.\" </p> <p>However, Sinise's acting prowess and verve was enough to convince Kinney to go ahead with a production of Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead with Sinise and Kinney in the title roles and Perry as the Player King: \"We had a wonderful time working together,\" says Kinney. \"On the closing night we sat on a bench and said, 'we need to continue this'.\" </p> <p>While Perry and Kinney returned to university to scout for actors, Sinise scoured Highland Park for premises, eventually settling on the Immaculate Conception Catholic School, which was prepared to let out a disused basement for the knock-down price of $1 a year. With the addition of Laurie Metcalf (then Kinney's girlfriend), Al Wilder and HE Baccus, who would become the first artistic director, company ranks soon began to grow: Joan Allen joined a year later in 1977. </p> <p>John Malkovich was discovered in a production of The Man Who Came To Dinner: \"It was the stupidest performance I ever saw,\" says Sinise. \"I thought: 'we've got to get this freak into our theatre'.\" Malkovich's recollection is equally robust: \"when they asked me, I sort of went, 'these assholes with their theatre'. I didn't really know them. And what I did know, I didn't really like. They were like the Angry Young Men, complaining about one thing or the other. And I thought, 'I'll stick this for a week, maybe for a month'. I thought that was as much as I could take. That was 25 years ago. They're still among my closest friends.\" </p> <p> The ad-hoc company selection process also brought together Sinise with Moira Harris, whom he first saw playing Laura in Cat On A Hot Tin Roof. \"It's a good way to first see your future wife,\" he says, \"in a negligee.\" Though her skittish volatility couldn't be further away from his hard-headed common sense, they hit it off: \"It was at some party in a friend's house after the show,\" she says, \"I loved him because he was very quiet and sweet and shy. And of course I thought he was awfully handsome, like a young Paul Newman. And he took me home and that was it.\" </p> <p>In the summer of 1976, this group convened in the cramped suburban basement, now equipped with 88 seats acquired in a fire sale, for the first fully-fledged Steppenwolf season, which included Ionesco's The Lesson and Leonard Malfi's Bird Bath. From the beginning, the dramas backstage were often no less heady and explosive than anything presented to the audience, with ensemble members jumping in and out of each others' beds, and meetings that became so heated that the police were sometimes called. These intense relationships would eventually lead to a clutch of weddings, including John Malkovich to Glenne Headly, Jeff Perry (after some love-triangle acrobatics) to Laurie Metcalf and, in 1981, Sinise to Moira Harris. </p> <p>Onstage, this translated into a company style, which was, according to Perry, hardly subtle. While young companies on the East Coast immersed themselves in formal experimentation, Steppenwolf was placing all the emphasis on the vitality of traditional performance. Plays were chosen on the basis of the roles they offered, politics came a distant second to youthful aggression, and immediacy bordered on violence. \"We didn't pull punches,\" says Kinney, \"there was no fake hitting. We were punching each other. We were hauling on each other.\" Of all the ensemble members, it was Sinise's approach that most exemplified the company style: \"More than any of us, he had this sheer unpredictability,\" says Perry, \"a kind of danger that, when combined with real talent, you just can't help watching.\" </p> <p>Very quickly, it became apparent that something sensational was taking place. The Chicago press raved. \"Acting of staggering power\", said the Chicago Tribune of Israel Horowitz's The Indian Wants The Bronx in 1977. It went on, \"between them, Kinney, Sinise and Malkovich are giving some of the most accomplished and deeply felt performances it has been my pleasure to see on stage this year.\" </p> <p>But despite the glowing notices and the company's growing status, the first years involved financial hardship and material struggle. It was not unusual for the actors onstage to outnumber the audience: \"Sometimes, no-one would show up,\" says Sinise, \"and we would just throw a party.\" Initially unpaid, he worked as a groundsman, Laurie Metcalf as a secretary, Malkovich in a stationery store, while Jeff Perry drove an ice-cream van. </p> <p>Despite his devotion to the company, even Sinise found the pressure difficult to take and in 1979, he packed his bags and headed off to the West Coast, hoping to make a dent on Hollywood. \"It didn't quite work out,\" he admits, \"it was a miserable time.\" After a year of gruelling jobs as a soap opera extra - including a stint on Knots Landing playing a beach boy - he grabbed at the chance to return to Chicago in late 1980 as artistic director of Steppenwolf, when original member HE Baccus dropped out. </p> <p>Sinise began to demand that Steppenwolf behave like a real professional theatre company, with structured meetings replacing the anarchic, uproarious, touchy-feely get-togethers of the past. He also surprised the rest of the company by making a more concerted drive towards directing. In 1982 he oversaw the production that established Steppenwolf on the US national theatre map: Sam Shepard's True West, which had been a dismal failure when premiered two years before at the New York Public Theatre. </p> <p>Sinise's re-energised production in Chicago, with Malkovich as the drifter Lee and Jeff Perry as the anally retentive Austin, was an immediate smash, proclaimed by the Chicago Tribune, \"a knockdown, slam-bang, all-out battle to the finish... one of the funniest, scariest evenings of theatre we're likely to see\". </p> <p>When the possibility of a New York transfer arose, dissent broke out in the company. Some feared it would collapse. When Sinise insisted, Perry dropped out (to be replaced in the Austin role by Sinise himself) with the rest demanding that the Steppenwolf name be removed. The premiere at the off-Broadway Cherry Lane Theatre in October 1982 was an instant sensation, trumpeted as the \"New York acting debut of the decade\", referring not to Sinise, or even the production, but to the performance of John Malkovich. The Village Voice reviewed only Malkovich's performance, ignoring everything else. </p> <p>\"It was very difficult for Gary,\" remembers long time Steppenwolf member Russ Smith, \"You had David Bowie and Jackie Onassis knocking on the dressing room door, elbowing Gary out of the way to get to John.\" As the run continued, Sinise's feeling of isolation began to grow: \"While I was happy things were happening for John, I was a little baffled at what was going on with me. His career was off and running. There were times when I'd go to Times Square and eat sandwiches and play Asteroids after the show and he'd go out with Antonioni or Cassavetes. I wasn't invited.\" </p> <p>Just as the dissenters had predicted, the True West phenomenon, and Malkovich's sudden and spectacular rise was ultimately responsible for the fragmentation of a company built on a bedrock of ensemble cohesion and equality. \"Opinions changed and all of a sudden everybody wanted to go to New York,\" Sinise remembers, \"It was like an epidemic.\" Acclaimed New York transfers of Lanford Wilson's Balm In Gilead and Shepard's Fool For Love launched the Hollywood careers of Laurie Metcalf, who would soon appear in Desperately Seeking Susan, Glenne Headly (who would soon appear alongside husband Malkovich in Eleni) and Joan Allen. </p> <p>But Sinise, who was still Steppenwolf artistic director, chose to stifle his own ambitions and make an attempt to keep the company together. At the time, his own per sonal life, in the shape of the often tumultuous relationship with his wife Moira Harris, had begun to unravel completely: \"When we took True West to New York,\" says Harris, \"We separated and dated other people. We were married but we had verbal separation agreement. Then he said: 'I don't know now - I've fallen in love with so and so'. I said 'Well okay, that's fine'. Then a week later he came back to Chicago, and we were back together again. But it went on for quite a while like that, him wanting me, me wanting him.\" </p> <p>As in the Highland Park days, Steppenwolf, which had moved to its current Halstead Street location, offered stability and a safe haven. Perhaps smarting from the experience of being overshadowed in True West, Sinise concentrated even more on directing. In 1985, he oversaw a production of Lyle Kessler's Orphans, which would eventually transfer to the West End with Albert Finney (who won an Olivier award for the role), and in 1986 directed Tom Waits in the world premier of Frank's Wild Years, the singer/composer's two act opera. </p> <p>These successes would lead to an invitation from David Puttnam, then head of Columbia Pictures, to make another assault on Hollywood, this time as a director. Sinise relinquished the artistic directorship of the theatre and relocated with Harris to where he still continues to live, in Malibu. His first, less than auspicious, script choice was Miles From Home, a rural saga about two brothers who torch their farm rather than let it be repossessed, that would eventually star Richard Gere in a plucky outcast role that might have worked if Sinise himself had played it. Despite an invitation to show the film in competition in Cannes, it garnered only tepid reviews: \"Gary was quite devastated,\" remembers Russ Smith, \"We moved on to Paris afterwards and it was impossible to shake him from his depression. It was a couple of years before he would even entertain the thought of doing another film.\" </p> <p>Sinise retreated once again to Steppenwolf to play Tom Joad in the Tony award-winning 1990 production of Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath, only reluctantly returning to Hollywood for Steinbeck's Of Mice And Men. This time everything came together. Reprising the role of George and Lenny that he and Malkovich had played at Steppenwolf 10 years earlier, and employing his father as film editor, Sinise produced what many critics regard as a miniature masterpiece. \"This time, when we took it to Cannes,\" Sinise remembers, \"we got a 15-minute standing ovation. They gave me a tape of it afterwards.\" But despite ecstatic reviews, marketing problems and budget constraints at Columbia meant that the film never reached its audience. </p> <p>By now, however, Sinise's film acting career was taking off at last. He had already been cast as the legless Vietnam veteran Lt. Dan in Forrest Gump, for which he received an Oscar nomination, and would soon move on to Apollo 13. Then, via title roles in the TV movies George Wallace and the impressive Truman, he won big-screen leads in Ransom, Snake Eyes, and Mission To Mars. Sinise had finally crept out of the shadow of his Steppenwolf colleagues and blossomed into a Hollywood star. </p> <p>With characteristic candour, he admits that some of the films he's appeared in have not quite possessed the artistic merit he once aspired to: \"I'm in a certain age range and a certain look and the possibilities just keep getting nar rower and narrower,\" he says, \"Add in the celebrity thing and that narrows the field. So I try to pick the best of what might be available to me and it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be great.\" </p> <p>But since success has come relatively late in life, he has been able to enjoy it without allowing fame to skew his true priorities: his family, first and foremost, which now includes Sophie, 11, McCanna, 9, and Ella, 7, and his resilient marriage to Harris, which, unlike the other Steppenwolf unions, somehow survives. And Sinise can devote himself to film work and fully enjoy the benefits of Hollywood without feeling that it defines him as an actor. </p> <p>Despite Steppenwolf's loss of identity in the mid- to late-80s, it remains a sanctuary where original core members can creatively recharge and rekindle the old Steppenwolf spirit.

      "bodyText": "It is a glorious thing when Gary Sinise demonstrates the curious, tilting snarl that he affectionately calls \"the sneer.\" First the head flicks back and the eyelids droop, an expression epitomising the concept of self-absorbed, somnolent cool. Then, as the upper lip curls, his sleek, sturdy features disintegrate into a combination of defiant faux- confidence and adolescent uncertainty. In its tentative swagger, there are overtones of James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause and a hint of the young Paul Newman of The Hustler. For just a few moments, in a corner of the cosy Italian restaurant across the road from the Steppenwolf main auditorium in Chicago, Gary Sinise becomes what he once was: \"a young punk, experimenting with all kinds of stuff, lashing out at authority\". This is precisely how drama teacher Barbara Patterson, now 70, first encountered the 16-year-old Sinise in a corridor of Highland Park high school in spring 1971: \"I was going down this hallway,\" she recalls, \"it was where some of the ne'er-do-wells hung out. Then I saw these guys, leaning against the wall, looking like gang members. We were doing the school musical and I said: 'you look like you stepped out of West Side Story'. I particularly looked at Gary, who seemed to be the leader and was sneering the hardest, and said: 'You look like you could be a Shark or a Jet. I want to see you at auditions this afternoon'.\" It would prove a fateful encounter, one that would eventually become central to the mythology of one of America's greatest theatre ensemble: Chicago's Steppenwolf. Founded in a tiny church basement of his home Chicago suburb of Highland Park by Sinise and his high school friend Jeff Perry and Terry Kinney, the company had soon forged a distinctive style of performance of such physicality, intensity and emotional force that it left front-row audience members fearing for both their own and the actors' safety. Blessed with brute talent, the company launched many outstanding screen careers, including those of John Malkovich, Joan Allen, Kevin Anderson, Laurie Metcalf (Roseanne's sister), John Mahoney (Frasier's father), and Sinise himself. Now approaching its 25th anniversary, Steppenwolf is mentioned by critics in the same breath as US legends such as the Group Theatre - from the 30s - and New York's Circle Repertory. Variety magazine calls it \"the country's foremost actors' theatre\". \"A name synonymous with a visceral acting style full of raw passion,\" said Playbill magazine, \"the uncompromising, in-your-face school of acting dubbed 'rock'n'roll theatre'.\" The hallway confrontation between the drama teacher and the posturing youth would leave an equally profound, life-long impression on Sinise himself. An academic malcontent who left school barely able to read, he went on to become artistic director of Steppenwolf in the early 80s, initiating much that established the company nationally and internationally. Equally impressive for someone with minimal formal education, he went on to direct some of the company's most successful shows, including the 1982 production of Sam Shepard's True West which propelled John Malkovich to stardom, and the 1996 revival of Buried Child, which earned Sinise a Tony nomination. On screen, in 1992, he directed a masterly adaptation of Steinbeck's Of Mice And Men. Only as he was approaching his forties did Sinise belatedly and remarkably - given his age - establish himself as a major movie actor, with roles in Forrest Gump (for which he received an Oscar nomination), Apollo 13, Ransom, and Mission To Mars. Along the way, he has earned the devotion of his directors: \"When I worked with John Gielgud or with Richard Burton it was the same thing,\" says John Frankenheimer, who directed Sinise's Emmy-winning performance in the TV movie George Wallace, \"his choices are 100% right. Gary Sinise is, quite simply, a great actor. If I had my way, I'd have him in all my movies.\" In person, Sinise is fiercely down-to-earth and unpretentious. In his tatty jeans and scruffy baseball cap, he might slip by unnoticed were it not for that face, still unnaturally youthful at 45, classically American in its full proportions, and shot through with the na\u00efve masculinity that has often marked out Hollywood leading men. Despite moving to Malibu in California in the late 80s, he retains every syrupy nuance of his Chicago accent - a slow methodical drawl so meticulously polite in that peculiar old-fashioned mid-western manner that you'd almost expect him to suffix every sentence with \"ma'am\" or \"sir\". He's self-effacing: \"I have simple tastes, simple desires. If you are going to try to dig out complex or contradictory strands, you're wasting your time.\" He still credits Barbara Patterson as the reason why all this happened and is in regular contact with his old mentor. However, as implied by his uncanny ability to play villains (Ransom, Snake Eyes) as well as all-American heroes, beneath the boyish exterior is a tension that hints at more. \"He has honesty, vulnerability and humour but a character underneath which can turn to menace quite easily,\" says director Ron Howard, in a comment that could apply as neatly to his character as his acting, \"it's a kind of straightforward, working-class, 'feet planted on the ground' quality that at the same time says: 'you better stay out of my way'.\" It is no surprise that Sinise is avidly anti-intellectual, a man who, even now, finds reading difficult: \"I have friends who could start a book at six and finish it by midnight,\" he says, shaking his head, \"I simply can't understand that. I wish I could read all those Tolstoy books and go through Joyce but I just can't. I'm still a very slow reader.\" At Steppenwolf, his aversion to all things literary has become something of a running gag: \"We used to joke, even when Gary was artistic director,\" says Laurie Metcalf, \"that he only ever read the plays that he was in.\" Instead of any intellectual gloss, what Sinise delivers is pure passion. Even in conversation, it washes over him in great waves: \"Theatre to me is for the gut, it's for the heart. That's what I get off on. I'm not a theorist. I'm not into intellectual masturbation. All I want is a simple reaction to the feeling of what is happening onstage, a visceral, gut reaction.\" In certain circumstances, it is easy to see how this untutored ardour might work to his disadvantage: \"He bulls his way through a lot of situations and doesn't always show huge compassion for people,\" says Steppenwolf co-founder Terry Kinney. \"If he feels something should happen, everyone else will be forced to make way.\" His \"spontaneity\" has probably contributed to a turbulent personal life: his 19-year marriage to Steppenwolf ensemble co-member Moira Harris has endured numerous affairs and separations: \"We've weathered many, many storms,\" Sinise says, \"Many times it was questionable where we were going.\" But as most original Steppenwolf members will agree, it was this same ferocious zeal and sometimes blind commitment that held the troupe together when they were playing to single-figure audiences in a cramped basement: \"Gary always had the strongest vision of the group,\" remembers Metcalf. \"For some of us it was just sort of a summer fling. But for Gary it was always more than that. It was obviously what he wanted to do with his life. \"He had a whole reserve of passion stored up because he wasn't really putting it anywhere else. This gave him all the energy and fearlessness to move us ahead. \" Ultimately, he forced them to believe, in what at the time must have seemed to outsiders as monumental folly or conceit, that they were a great company, and as Sinise commented at the time to his mother \"some day, all the world will know\". Gary Alan Sinise was born in the quiet suburb of Blue Island, Illinois, about 20 miles south of downtown Chicago on the March 17 1955, first child of Millie (nee Alsip) and Robert L Sinise, a film editor who, early in his career, specialised in C-Grade horror flicks such as Blood Feast and Two Thousand Maniacs!. \"I remember as a kid going down to the editing room,\" Gary says, \"and my Dad would be working. I remember being five years old looking at these slasher movies of my dad, all this blood, chainsaws and screaming.\" When Gary was nine, the family moved to Highland Park, the cluster of dormitory estates 30 miles north of downtown Chicago on the shores of Lake Michigan where life was for the most part \"very normal and suburban\", says Robert Sinise. Gary and his younger brother Randy played football. Sister Lori was a cheerleader. However, almost from the moment he began school, Gary showed, \"no interest at all in academic studies\", according to his mother. By the time he reached Highland Park High in 1970 he was the picture of disaffected, rebellious youth: long-haired, leather-wearing, dope-smoking and playing in grungy garage bands with names like Uproot Confusion, The Olde Molde and Dirty Brain. \"I wanted to be Hendrix,\" he says, \"I used to play guitar with my teeth.\" Already written off by teachers as hopeless by the time Barbara Patterson collared him, Sinise was skipping classes and had had a brush with the law \"for a pot-related offence\". But then, in the great tradition of greasepaint epiphany, everything changed. After showing up at the West Side Story audition, simply out of curiosity, he landed the role of the Shark Pepe - \"about two lines and a lot of strutting around\". By the last night of the production, any scepticism had melted away and Sinise was hooked. \"One of the kids in the show brought him up front for the bow,\" says Barbara Patterson, \"He was in tears. It was a moment of intense bonding for him, not just with theatre but with what he wanted to be.\" Equally importantly, it was at the audition that he first met Steppenwolf co-founder Jeff Perry, who was cast against him as Jet: \"We were the odd couple,\" remembers Perry, \"I was in glasses that were slightly larger than the rest of my entire head and he was in a leather vest. He was a rock star and I was what would now be considered a computer nerd. But we hit it off and soon we were inseparable.\" While Perry moved on to study theatre at Illinois State University, where he met the final member of the original Steppenwolf triumvirate, Terry Kinney, Sinise stayed behind in high school, needing an extra six months to complete his diploma. On graduation in 1974, he converted a local Unitarian church into a stopgap theatre and gathered a group of high school friends to form a company, naming it after the Herman Hesse novel that happened to be lying around. Among the first Steppenwolf productions was the musical Grease, which Perry and Kinney travelled from university to see in June 1974: \"They had lights made out of old coffee tins,\" Kinney remembers, \"a makeshift lighting board and costumes out of the junkyard.\" However, Sinise's acting prowess and verve was enough to convince Kinney to go ahead with a production of Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead with Sinise and Kinney in the title roles and Perry as the Player King: \"We had a wonderful time working together,\" says Kinney. \"On the closing night we sat on a bench and said, 'we need to continue this'.\" While Perry and Kinney returned to university to scout for actors, Sinise scoured Highland Park for premises, eventually settling on the Immaculate Conception Catholic School, which was prepared to let out a disused basement for the knock-down price of $1 a year. With the addition of Laurie Metcalf (then Kinney's girlfriend), Al Wilder and HE Baccus, who would become the first artistic director, company ranks soon began to grow: Joan Allen joined a year later in 1977. John Malkovich was discovered in a production of The Man Who Came To Dinner: \"It was the stupidest performance I ever saw,\" says Sinise. \"I thought: 'we've got to get this freak into our theatre'.\" Malkovich's recollection is equally robust: \"when they asked me, I sort of went, 'these assholes with their theatre'. I didn't really know them. And what I did know, I didn't really like. They were like the Angry Young Men, complaining about one thing or the other. And I thought, 'I'll stick this for a week, maybe for a month'. I thought that was as much as I could take. That was 25 years ago. They're still among my closest friends.\" The ad-hoc company selection process also brought together Sinise with Moira Harris, whom he first saw playing Laura in Cat On A Hot Tin Roof. \"It's a good way to first see your future wife,\" he says, \"in a negligee.\" Though her skittish volatility couldn't be further away from his hard-headed common sense, they hit it off: \"It was at some party in a friend's house after the show,\" she says, \"I loved him because he was very quiet and sweet and shy. And of course I thought he was awfully handsome, like a young Paul Newman. And he took me home and that was it.\" In the summer of 1976, this group convened in the cramped suburban basement, now equipped with 88 seats acquired in a fire sale, for the first fully-fledged Steppenwolf season, which included Ionesco's The Lesson and Leonard Malfi's Bird Bath. From the beginning, the dramas backstage were often no less heady and explosive than anything presented to the audience, with ensemble members jumping in and out of each others' beds, and meetings that became so heated that the police were sometimes called. These intense relationships would eventually lead to a clutch of weddings, including John Malkovich to Glenne Headly, Jeff Perry (after some love-triangle acrobatics) to Laurie Metcalf and, in 1981, Sinise to Moira Harris. Onstage, this translated into a company style, which was, according to Perry, hardly subtle. While young companies on the East Coast immersed themselves in formal experimentation, Steppenwolf was placing all the emphasis on the vitality of traditional performance. Plays were chosen on the basis of the roles they offered, politics came a distant second to youthful aggression, and immediacy bordered on violence. \"We didn't pull punches,\" says Kinney, \"there was no fake hitting. We were punching each other. We were hauling on each other.\" Of all the ensemble members, it was Sinise's approach that most exemplified the company style: \"More than any of us, he had this sheer unpredictability,\" says Perry, \"a kind of danger that, when combined with real talent, you just can't help watching.\" Very quickly, it became apparent that something sensational was taking place. The Chicago press raved. \"Acting of staggering power\", said the Chicago Tribune of Israel Horowitz's The Indian Wants The Bronx in 1977. It went on, \"between them, Kinney, Sinise and Malkovich are giving some of the most accomplished and deeply felt performances it has been my pleasure to see on stage this year.\" But despite the glowing notices and the company's growing status, the first years involved financial hardship and material struggle. It was not unusual for the actors onstage to outnumber the audience: \"Sometimes, no-one would show up,\" says Sinise, \"and we would just throw a party.\" Initially unpaid, he worked as a groundsman, Laurie Metcalf as a secretary, Malkovich in a stationery store, while Jeff Perry drove an ice-cream van. Despite his devotion to the company, even Sinise found the pressure difficult to take and in 1979, he packed his bags and headed off to the West Coast, hoping to make a dent on Hollywood. \"It didn't quite work out,\" he admits, \"it was a miserable time.\" After a year of gruelling jobs as a soap opera extra - including a stint on Knots Landing playing a beach boy - he grabbed at the chance to return to Chicago in late 1980 as artistic director of Steppenwolf, when original member HE Baccus dropped out. Sinise began to demand that Steppenwolf behave like a real professional theatre company, with structured meetings replacing the anarchic, uproarious, touchy-feely get-togethers of the past. He also surprised the rest of the company by making a more concerted drive towards directing. In 1982 he oversaw the production that established Steppenwolf on the US national theatre map: Sam Shepard's True West, which had been a dismal failure when premiered two years before at the New York Public Theatre. Sinise's re-energised production in Chicago, with Malkovich as the drifter Lee and Jeff Perry as the anally retentive Austin, was an immediate smash, proclaimed by the Chicago Tribune, \"a knockdown, slam-bang, all-out battle to the finish... one of the funniest, scariest evenings of theatre we're likely to see\". When the possibility of a New York transfer arose, dissent broke out in the company. Some feared it would collapse. When Sinise insisted, Perry dropped out (to be replaced in the Austin role by Sinise himself) with the rest demanding that the Steppenwolf name be removed. The premiere at the off-Broadway Cherry Lane Theatre in October 1982 was an instant sensation, trumpeted as the \"New York acting debut of the decade\", referring not to Sinise, or even the production, but to the performance of John Malkovich. The Village Voice reviewed only Malkovich's performance, ignoring everything else. \"It was very difficult for Gary,\" remembers long time Steppenwolf member Russ Smith, \"You had David Bowie and Jackie Onassis knocking on the dressing room door, elbowing Gary out of the way to get to John.\" As the run continued, Sinise's feeling of isolation began to grow: \"While I was happy things were happening for John, I was a little baffled at what was going on with me. His career was off and running. There were times when I'd go to Times Square and eat sandwiches and play Asteroids after the show and he'd go out with Antonioni or Cassavetes. I wasn't invited.\" Just as the dissenters had predicted, the True West phenomenon, and Malkovich's sudden and spectacular rise was ultimately responsible for the fragmentation of a company built on a bedrock of ensemble cohesion and equality. \"Opinions changed and all of a sudden everybody wanted to go to New York,\" Sinise remembers, \"It was like an epidemic.\" Acclaimed New York transfers of Lanford Wilson's Balm In Gilead and Shepard's Fool For Love launched the Hollywood careers of Laurie Metcalf, who would soon appear in Desperately Seeking Susan, Glenne Headly (who would soon appear alongside husband Malkovich in Eleni) and Joan Allen. But Sinise, who was still Steppenwolf artistic director, chose to stifle his own ambitions and make an attempt to keep the company together. At the time, his own per sonal life, in the shape of the often tumultuous relationship with his wife Moira Harris, had begun to unravel completely: \"When we took True West to New York,\" says Harris, \"We separated and dated other people.

The Kirov phenomenon isn't new, but this is the first time we've been able to experience it on such an unprecedented scale, as an explosion of voices and orchestra in a repertoire that hasn't been explored in the west as much as it might have been.

The Kirov is, first and foremost, a company, a group of people working together with equal commitment, a set-up far removed from the western system of jet-setting singers pitching up wherever to slot their own interpretation of a role into a new or pre-existing production. It would be wrong to assume that western opera houses don't deliver great performances (the Royal Opera's Der Rosenkavalier, for instance, was one of the outstanding achievements of last season). It's just that you don't always get the cogency of ensemble work that seems to flow from the Kirov each time you hear them. </p> <p>It should also be remembered that many of the Kirov's current performers were born and brought up under the Soviet system, which, whatever its political faults, assiduously fostered musical talent in a way that western democracy never quite has done. Singers from what was once eastern Europe have testified to the encouragement they received, as well as the strenuous, knackering schedules they were often forced to adopt. Some have expressed despondency at talent going to waste in the west, where money is all, and lack of funds sometimes means that singers don't always get the musical education they require.

This was ably demonstrated in Being Caprice (Alt-TV, C4), in which the lissome media-babe had obligingly agreed to wear a tiny hidden camera for 10 days while she went through her exhausting schedule of parties, chat shows and awards ceremonies. It only went to show that while the camera doesn't lie, its footage does exactly what it's told in the editing suite. </p> <p>The film gave the illusion of intimacy, never more so than when a panicky Caprice decided she had to pee just before receiving Maxim magazine's Woman of the Year award. A voyeur's dream, surely - alone with Caprice in the ladies' loo, as she carefully spreads toilet paper on the seat before sitting on it. But anti-climax had pursued her into the cubicle. \"Oh God! I can't go! I can't believe this!\" wailed the international style icon, hastily re-robing and offering barely a glimpse of thigh. </p> <p>On this evidence, being Caprice consists merely of one long round of drudgery as she drags herself through endless appointments and picks her way through avenues of photographers, only to return home to an empty house and a fridge containing nothing but those Muller yoghurts with lumps of fruit in them (Caprice kept spilling dollops of yoghurt down herself, but restricted herself to the prim expletive: \"Shoot!\"). No boyfriends. No candle-lit dinners for two. No romantic weekends pottering round the Cte d'Azur in an E-Type Jag. Just a damp couple of days at her forlorn-looking empty house in Los Angeles. </p> <p>A psychiatrist might conclude that Caprice suffers from a dangerously split personality. Incontrovertibly, her whole life has been geared to turning herself into a carefully-designed and maintained fantasy object, like a computer-generated facsimile of what glamour is supposed to mean in the current media climate. And she knows it. \"It's unbelievably superficial,\" she confessed, submitting to yet another barrage of flashguns. \"It's vain. It's catty. It's bitchy. And I love it.\" </p> <p>Not much ambiguity there, but on other occasions our heroine felt moved to complain about the press's outrageous habit of blowing stories about her out of all proportion. Imagine that! For instance, the Sun became very excited about her possible romantic liaison with Prince Andrew, prompting Caprice to turn all indignant. All she had done, she seethed, was \"have dinner with a friend of mine\". </p> <p>When she recorded a pop single, she was disgusted by the \"cynicism\" that greeted it in the media. The press were sceptical about her songwriting skills. Most insulting of all: \"They were comparing me to Naomi Campbell! I just thought how dare you!\" </p> <p>Perhaps Caprice is merely a victim of her own success. She has invented a public persona so irresistible to men's magazines, Hello! and even Playboy that there's no room for the \"real \" Caprice, if there ever was one. \"I've been put in the spotlight in such a way where it's every single day,\" she lamented, as though her career had nothing to do with her and she was merely an onlooker. \"It's not like I'm in the papers once a month - it's all the time.\" But what does she want us to do? Drool over her photographs or make her a soothing cup of tea? </p> <p>Friends (C4) returned, but is having to work desperately hard to camouflage the fact that the cast's car wrecks and squabbles over money are more interesting than their show. With Ross and Rachel having inadvertently got married in Las Vegas and Monica finally agreeing to live with Chandler, they're going to have to start calling it Significant Others, and where are the ratings in that? </p> <p>Even The Open Golf Championship (BBC2), Steve Rider's film about the 1999 Open Golf Cham-pionship at Carnoustie, was a better bet, obviously not because it was about golf, but because of the sly light it shed on the pampered playboys of the international circuit.

      "body": "<p>By the time you read this, I will be in Torquay. Okay, as great first lines go, it's not \"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\" or \"Hale knew, before he had been in Brighton three hours, that they meant to murder him\". If I'd written that I was in Montenegro, or Arizona, the phrase would have a sort of Gothic grandeur; it's the \"Torquay\" that robs it of its doomed glory. But sometimes doomed glory is a bore, and niceness is all you want or need. </p> <p>I like everything about Torquay, and the first brilliant thing about it is the drive there from Brighton. Just as I didn't start going abroad until 1995, I didn't start being driven on motorways until a couple of years later. Just as well, really; both my husbands were blessed with short and filthy tempers, and I'm sure that any attempt at motoring would have brought our ill-starred unions to even faster and nastier ends. But then I had the good luck to take up with a young man of unparalleled patience and good humour, and we began to take motoring trips. Now I love them, with the zeal of a very late convert. </p> <p>I like everything about driving: the maps, the service stations, the beautiful, long, sexy motorways, where the rushing of cars from the arterial roads makes you feel like Raquel Welch in Fantastic Voyage, all of us corpuscles streaming into the white-hot body politic of modern Britain. Motorways (cue Black Box Recorder: \"The English motorway system/Is beautiful and strange\") makes me feel oceanic and very loving towards mankind in a way that oceans themselves never do; all of us, rushing about our all-important business that we will one day discover wasn't important at all, moving frantically away from our deaths, we imagine, when of course every move we make, in any direction, brings us closer to them - how can you not love a crazy little species like that? We're just so cute! </p> <p>On a motorway, I feel very impatient with green ideals, which would see us condemned to eke out our lives in one little patch, never pushing on here and there for fear of spoiling the ecology. It's a nice life for a tree, but no life for a human in all our restless and complex perfection. </p> <p>In cars, I like to look at other people, and see them completely unselfconscious and secure as they are in no other area of life. For many people, confined by the drudgery of boring work and dull marriages, driving is the only time they are truly alone, in limbo, answerable to and belonging to no one. It is the only time they may experience anything like silence, as the demands and longer hours of being an ever-better parent and an ever-harder worker eat into our lives; the arrival of the mobile phone and its babbling captives has effectively rendered the train, once such a blessed retreat from ceaseless jabbering, into a regular little talkathon, but if it's your car you can keep your own phone turned off. We hear a lot about road rage, but I bet you anything that if cars were banned tomorrow, the murder rate would double as the last bastion of solitude was taken away from millions of over-worked, under-loved people. Road rage is not about roads at all, but about the rage in the rest of our lives; only in our cars do we feel free enough to express it. </p> <p>Such is my love of motoring that, the other day, I cracked my boyfriend up - so much so that he had to pull over until he stopped laughing - by inquiring with genuine interest and excitement: \"So, which is your favourite colour traffic light - red, green or the orangey one?\" But I was really interested. </p> <p>Growing up, ours was the only family that didn't have a car (when I typed that sentence then, look you, I accidentally typed \"didn't have a care\" instead, and as Freudian slips go that's a pretty good one). Instead, we went on holiday by train, and I can't help thinking this had a good deal to do with the incredible happiness of our family holidays. There can be no doubt that it is preferable to transport children in trains rather than cars; if the little darlings don't have somewhere they can stretch their legs and run about inside a vehicle, I find, their behaviour becomes so bad that it is a great temptation to let them stretch their legs and run about outside the vehicle. Like on the motorway. </p> <p>Cars seem to me a very adult pleasure, like sex and drugs; and, like them, are not really appropriate for children. The sight of the modern child ferried from door to door, from home to school, day in, day out, is one of the most depressing of recent times, completely robbing children of the chance to explore and mature. Similarly, the commuter sitting in his car for two hours when a train could get him to work in 50 minutes makes no sense at all. </p> <p>But though it may not be the most efficient form of transport known to man, driving can be fantastically pleasurable, something those on both sides of the current petrol price row seem to have forgotten. To the Daily Mail, the car is a grim necessity; to the government, it's an unnecessary menace. I suggest they both lighten up and sit down to watch the old English flick Genevieve together, which will surely give them a bit of perspective. </p> <p> Like sex and drugs, cars are neither \"good\" nor \"bad\"; they are as merely good or bad as the people using them. At the moment, bad motorists seem to get away with far too much. The test should be made harder and the licence re-applied for every five years. If anyone is found driving under the influence of alcohol, their car keys should be taken away on the spot and never returned. If someone actually kills someone through careless driving, they should be dealt with the same as any other murderer. But most motorists are not irresponsible monsters; wincing under the accusations of spreading pollution, asthma and all manner of air-borne evil, they could actually use a little more Me time. </p> <p>\"Is Your Journey Really Necessary?\" asked billboards beside the roads of Britain during the war and after, encouraging drivers not to waste petrol. What I'm proposing is a motoring culture in which driving is done as a pleasure, and in fact where only the unnecessary journeys are undertaken - every drive a wanted drive. We have worried ourselves out of guilt-free drinking, smoking and eating; it would be a shame if our anhedonia grew so all-consuming that the simple pleasure of driving towards somewhere nice on a sunny day with someone you love was also put beyond the pale.</p>",

Motorways (cue Black Box Recorder: \"The English motorway system/Is beautiful and strange\") makes me feel oceanic and very loving towards mankind in a way that oceans themselves never do; all of us, rushing about our all-important business that we will one day discover wasn't important at all, moving frantically away from our deaths, we imagine, when of course every move we make, in any direction, brings us closer to them - how can you not love a crazy little species like that? We're just so cute! On a motorway, I feel very impatient with green ideals, which would see us condemned to eke out our lives in one little patch, never pushing on here and there for fear of spoiling the ecology. It's a nice life for a tree, but no life for a human in all our restless and complex perfection. In cars, I like to look at other people, and see them completely unselfconscious and secure as they are in no other area of life. For many people, confined by the drudgery of boring work and dull marriages, driving is the only time they are truly alone, in limbo, answerable to and belonging to no one. It is the only time they may experience anything like silence, as the demands and longer hours of being an ever-better parent and an ever-harder worker eat into our lives; the arrival of the mobile phone and its babbling captives has effectively rendered the train, once such a blessed retreat from ceaseless jabbering, into a regular little talkathon, but if it's your car you can keep your own phone turned off. We hear a lot about road rage, but I bet you anything that if cars were banned tomorrow, the murder rate would double as the last bastion of solitude was taken away from millions of over-worked, under-loved people. Road rage is not about roads at all, but about the rage in the rest of our lives; only in our cars do we feel free enough to express it. Such is my love of motoring that, the other day, I cracked my boyfriend up - so much so that he had to pull over until he stopped laughing - by inquiring with genuine interest and excitement: \"So, which is your favourite colour traffic light - red, green or the orangey one?\" But I was really interested. Growing up, ours was the only family that didn't have a car (when I typed that sentence then, look you, I accidentally typed \"didn't have a care\" instead, and as Freudian slips go that's a pretty good one). Instead, we went on holiday by train, and I can't help thinking this had a good deal to do with the incredible happiness of our family holidays. There can be no doubt that it is preferable to transport children in trains rather than cars; if the little darlings don't have somewhere they can stretch their legs and run about inside a vehicle, I find, their behaviour becomes so bad that it is a great temptation to let them stretch their legs and run about outside the vehicle. Like on the motorway. Cars seem to me a very adult pleasure, like sex and drugs; and, like them, are not really appropriate for children. The sight of the modern child ferried from door to door, from home to school, day in, day out, is one of the most depressing of recent times, completely robbing children of the chance to explore and mature. Similarly, the commuter sitting in his car for two hours when a train could get him to work in 50 minutes makes no sense at all. But though it may not be the most efficient form of transport known to man, driving can be fantastically pleasurable, something those on both sides of the current petrol price row seem to have forgotten. To the Daily Mail, the car is a grim necessity; to the government, it's an unnecessary menace. I suggest they both lighten up and sit down to watch the old English flick Genevieve together, which will surely give them a bit of perspective. Like sex and drugs, cars are neither \"good\" nor \"bad\"; they are as merely good or bad as the people using them. At the moment, bad motorists seem to get away with far too much. The test should be made harder and the licence re-applied for every five years. If anyone is found driving under the influence of alcohol, their car keys should be taken away on the spot and never returned. If someone actually kills someone through careless driving, they should be dealt with the same as any other murderer. But most motorists are not irresponsible monsters; wincing under the accusations of spreading pollution, asthma and all manner of air-borne evil, they could actually use a little more Me time. \"Is Your Journey Really Necessary?\" asked billboards beside the roads of Britain during the war and after, encouraging drivers not to waste petrol. What I'm proposing is a motoring culture in which driving is done as a pleasure, and in fact where only the unnecessary journeys are undertaken - every drive a wanted drive. We have worried ourselves out of guilt-free drinking, smoking and eating; it would be a shame if our anhedonia grew so all-consuming that the simple pleasure of driving towards somewhere nice on a sunny day with someone you love was also put beyond the pale.",

The enormous knocked-through living room, with its chic collision of period mouldings and global art, is the key space. Also on this level, Lijn and Weiss bought and converted a flat next door into a kitchen and study, both accessible through doors, made by Lijn, of glass etched to a web design. \"I'm fascinated with mesh and nets,\" she says. \"The net is the earliest symbol of life.\" </p> <p>The top of the dining table is also made of Lijn's web glass, and she also designed its arboreal base of cast bronze. \"About eight years ago, I decided to make things myself,\" she says.

She has several whirring away at home, and has programmed some to come on with the lights: \"Otherwise, you never turn them on.\" </p> <p>Her work is soon to appear in a review of kinetic art at London's Hayward Gallery. \"It aims to underpin the movement - if one can call it that - and relate it to something more serious than mechanical phenomena: to cosmology, for instance.\" </p> <p>Everything has meaning in Lijn's house, where several strands of intellectual and spiritual life are manifest - Zen Buddhism and Far Eastern thought, pre-Judeo-Christian \"goddess\" worship, experimental modernism.

There are Camden-issue kelims, and yellow doors and sofas - the colour of Buddhism and enlightenment - and there are large pieces, such as her recent sculpture, My Body My Self, made with mica, bronze and neon light. </p> <p>Lijn's journey has taken her through the major avant-garde currents of the past half-century. It began when she lived in Switzerland and a friend urged her to come to Paris and study art. Lijn went, but studied archaeology and art history, and has retained a strong interest in mythology and early religions. \"It was the end of 1958, and we went to the Surrealist Caf\u00e9, where I met Andre Breton and Max Ernst,\" she says. Lijn had a show in Paris, in 1963, at the cultish English Bookshop gallery, and alongside Brion Gysin's \"cut-up\" literary experiment came her Poem Machines - cones with letters on them that formed words when spun. \"I had made these bars called vibrographs, on which black lines refracted and caused colours when spun. I wondered if I could do that with content: disintegrate words to make new meanings.\" </p> <p>During this time she came up with the name Lijn - she had been Segal, which friends thought conflicted with film star George. It turned out to mean \"line\" in Dutch. </p> <p>There was a relationship with the sculptor Takis (also in the Hayward show) and they had a child, Thanos. They \"couldn't live together\", and, in 1967, she came to London. \"It was fantastically lively,\" she says. \"It made Paris look like absolute boredom.\" (She wore a mini-skirt in Paris restaurant La Coupole, and \"people stood on tables and clapped\".) </p> <p>Lijn then showed at John Dunbar's gallery, Indica, where fellow artists included her friend Yoko Ono. \"It was an experimental and explorative time,\" she says. \"The avant-garde was still a live idea. And no one cared how old you were - it was what was happening in your head that was interesting.\" Contemporary British artists such as Cornelia Parker, Angela Bulloch and Damien Hirst have given the kinetic ethos an update, and Lijn is happy to evoke its past. \"Remember, they didn't just spring out of nothing,\" she says. </p> <p>After moving in with Weiss, a photographer and manufacturer of mica, she had two children, Sheba and Mischa. Weiss's business is the source for her liberally-used mica, which she even put on the kitchen cabinets. \"This is probably the only example of a mica kitchen,\" she says, adding that the sheen was taken off one side by a cleaner who thought it looked dirty. </p> <p>They raised their children and she made toys: Perspex cylinders with water inside, which she still displays. It was \"difficult with children living in a house full of breakable art\", and one can see how the centrepiece of the coffee table - a 60s artwork called Liquid Reflections, which includes two marble-like balls on a slowly revolving disc - could be tempting to infant fingers. </p> <p>But most seems to have survived, including several cone pieces from the 70s.

That was the day when the Navy's daily rum ration was finally abolished - probably not a moment too soon. Pusser's, named after the purser by whom it was distributed, is a hefty 54.5%, which makes the thought of the half-pint rations sailors once received pretty mind-boggling. Now, the marketing boys are trying to persuade us that Pusser's is drunk by It Girls called Camilla (not too sure what HRH will say about that), when in fact we all know that it's drunk by tarpots (elderly seaman) who converse entirely in naval slang. So, no tin hats (don't get pissed), or else you'll get scrubbed (be reprimanded). You may also like to know that Pusser's is blended from six individual rums from Guyana, Trinidad and the British Virgin Islands, and that its unique flavour comes from the use of exotic ingredients such as papaya leaf, breadfruit and iron.",

      "body": "<p><strong> 1961</strong></p> <p><strong> In early 1961, 17-year-old Sheila set off from Leeds for Paris, to study at the Sorbonne for a few months before starting her degree in England </strong><br> </p> <p> As the taxi from the airport headed towards the Latin Quarter and my room in a cheap hotel, I watched the meter anxiously. My sense of cities was still measured through Leeds, but Paris went on and on. Suddenly young people were spilling over the pavements of the Boulevard St Michel, their clothes signalling \"French students\". The hooting din all around, accompanied by shouted altercations through car windows and much waving of arms, amazed me. This was definitely not Leeds. I was in France! I sat back, relaxed and breathed freedom, preparing to transmogrify into a cross between Juliette Greco and Brigitte Bardot. </p> <p>But it was still me looking into the mirror of a small hotel room, the red hair I was intent on growing falling in two wings over my brow, the pink of my cheeks blotted out with pale make-up, which also concealed my lips, while two black existentialist lines accentuated my eyes. I sucked in my cheeks, sighing at my failure to look at all gaunt and raddled. Whereupon I turned to the making of my new ambience, unpacking my white \"modern\" fibreglass case and pinning up my postcards of Picasso's blue period and Toulouse-Lautrec, cultural treasures from a school trip to the Louvre. Then I drew back the shutters and looked out over the roofs. I was free - and terribly lonely. I would wander alone around the Left Bank, leafing through the second-hand bookstalls by the Seine, staring at the windows of little shops full of strange objects from Africa, visiting art galleries or laughing to myself at the Ionesco one-act plays in the tiny Th\u00e9tre de la Huchette. Monsieur at the reception desk was all insinuating smiles as I came and went. However, Madame regarded me with stony disapproval. </p> <p>Alone for long periods for the first time in my life, I drew on the inner world I had acquired secretly in defiance of the routines and enforced collectivity of boarding school. I imagined myself as unique; in fact, I was an entirely predictable cultural phenomenon. The Left Bank was full of young Britons and Americans drifting through Paris searching for traces of 40s existentialists. I was in pursuit of profound philosophising, but not only was I drawing blanks with my endeavours to find Parisian intellectuals, it was even proving impossible to reflect alone. No sooner had I settled on a bench or down by the quais than I would hear a voice in my ear making sexual propositions. I would scowl and try to sound gruff, but I was not really sure how to be gruff in French. </p> <p>Such incidents were generally annoying rather than alarming. Terror in a city was utterly unfamiliar to me. You could wander around in Leeds at that time without fear. After a month or so, I tried to copy the Parisian women, walking around head held high, without meeting anyone in the eye, and thus achieved a measure of city-type mobility. But it didn't come naturally, as I remained nosy, keen to know about everyone I encountered. This boundary-less curiosity kept getting me into trouble, but it didn't stop me wanting to migrate into the souls of strangers. </p> <p>The collision of assumptions I was encountering was not about sex alone. I had arrived in Paris just after the referendum in which the majority in France, weary of the colonial war, had voted for Algerian self-determination. That February, French settlers in Algeria, who were bitterly opposed to Algerian independence, had secretly formed the Organisation de l'Alg\u00e9rie Secr\u00e8te, the OAS. They were preparing to take up arms against General de Gaulle's government. </p> <p>My knowledge of the French political situation was hazy and abstract. I had read an exposure of French torture in Algeria, but was confused, knowing that Sartre and Camus, my cultural heroes, had been in opposing camps. As I walked past Algerians held at machine-gun point in the street by the \"flics\", I would feel a mute personal sympathy for victims with whom I vaguely identified. Yet in the cafes and the streets, it was the North African workers in France who would be my most persistent sexual tormentors. </p> <p>\"Tu aimes les Arabes?\" inquired Dominique, one of the French students I had met, when I confided my anxieties. Perched on a high stool in a cafe on the Boulevard St Michel, she spat out the word \"Arabes\" like a shot of concentrated bile. Her words made me flinch. They conjured up my father booming across the dining-room table about the British Raj, \"We built them the railroads.\" I was startled to hear someone of my own age echoing my father. From Suez in 1956, I had come to regard colonialism as outmoded and irrational. Former British colonies were gaining independence and pragmatic Conservatives such as Harold Macmillan were prepared to accept the \"wind of change\". </p> <p>My recoil, however, came not so much from any political response, but rather from a psychological repugnance against categorising people as inhuman, which was deeply rooted in childhood. My mother possessed the snobberies of her middle-class upbringing, but nonetheless had persistently challenged my father's verdicts on India and ridiculed the anti-Semitism that was rife in Leeds. The only time she had ever slapped me was when I came home from school aged around seven and parroted, \"She's a Catholic\" about a girl in my class called Margaret. \"Never say that about anyone.\" And I knew she was right. I liked Margaret. I had been mimicking the voice of the crowd, which I knew from experience could support the class bully. </p> <p>I looked at the pretty Parisienne opposite me with antagonism and resolved not to meet her again. Whereupon, with a toss of her brown curls, she admonished me, \"You must slap them in the face. Only then do they know that you don't want them.\" Despite my emotional abhorrence and regardless of liberal reason, her words hit the buried resentment that had accumulated from all those encounters with the men who had pestered me. I left her troubled and uneasy. </p> <p>My father had hired a Leeds removal firm called Turnbulls to deliver my school trunk. Unused to international transactions, the Leeds company sent it to a freight company's office on the outskirts of Paris. My journey to collect it took me to the end of the metro line, to arrive in a strange no-man's-land of half-built skyscrapers and partially-built roads surrounded by rough open ground where new suburbs were being built. </p> <p>As I had never been to the edge of the city and was uncertain where to go, I asked an old woman the way and was a little troubled when she hailed a young North African man, who nodded confidently and said he would show me. I looked at him searchingly. He was tall, around 23, with Brylcreemed hair and a moustache, wearing labourer's jeans. I was not sure what to do, but the politeness ingrained into my petit-bourgeois being, combined with my dislike of Dominique's attitudes, overcame my wariness. It was broad daylight, the old woman had approached him, he was being helpful. Anyway, how else was I going to find my trunk? I hesitated for a second and then followed him. </p> <p>He led me off the dirt road along a maze of paths through the building site. As we walked and walked, I began to suspect that we were going round in circles. Worried, I looked around. How was I to extricate myself? Who else could I ask? My companion, however, was courteous and reassuring. We arrived at a cafe. Did I want a drink. \"Non, non.\" However, he had a wine and insisted on getting me something. I had an espresso. We resumed our walking. Another cafe. I had an espresso. He insisted on paying. As we left he began asking me, \"Tu veux pisser.\" \"Non, non,\" I replied. Why was he going on about the toilet? School French had not included slang. \"Tu veux pisser.\" \"Non, non.\" I replied emphatically. I was getting seriously worried. Twilight was falling and I was completely lost in a wasteland. I knew I had to get away from this man. I was going to have to admit failure and give up on the trunk for today. Sounding as decisive as I could, I announced it was time for me to go home. Please would he show me the bus stop? He seemed to concur and said he had to ask someone the way. He headed off across a field. I stumbled after him over the uneven ground, the long heels of my stilettos sinking into the earth. </p> <p>We were in the middle of waste land when he turned round suddenly, grabbed me hard on the shoulder, bent his face towards mine and tried to kiss me. Dominique's confident pronouncement pierced through blind panic and I slapped him decisively on the cheek. His surprise gained me a second. He loosened his grip. I began to run over the mix of earth and grass. There were some shacks in the next field. I could hear music. Perhaps I could reach people and safety. My shoe came off. I stumbled and fell, and as I tried to get up he came towards me. I was scrambling on all fours over the ground in terror with my shoe in my hand. Then he was on top of me, holding me down. I tried to stab the pointed heel into his head, but he easily grabbed my hand, forcing my arm back. A peculiar relief flooded through me; even in these circumstances the possibility of wounding someone horrified me. I was struggling so desperately I managed to pull both of us a little way over the ground. But he was not letting go of me. </p> <p>I screamed. I was sure the men in the huts could hear. No one took any notice. He put his hand over my mouth, then his hands were round my neck, holding me down with his body. I kept wriggling and screaming. I could feel his hands tightening around my neck and saw my own panic reflected back in his eyes. \"I'm going to die,\" I thought. This had not been how I had imagined my life at all. \"I'm only 18. I've had no time to live.\" Then instead of terror an extraordinary clarity swept through my consciousness - all those black coffees and the adrenaline of fear. \"This man is much stronger than you physically,\" said a voice in my head. \"Stop struggling. Use your wits. You've been luckier than him in life. Fight him with the reason you've learned from being educated. Use the weapons of your privilege.\" </p> <p>Abruptly I stopped screaming and went still. His grip on my neck loosened. I began to make an elaborate and rational case. Raping me was unwise and would result in unnecessary trouble for him. The French authorities were very strict about North Africans in France. My father was a rich and powerful man in England and would pursue him in vengeance. I was a virgin. There were plenty of prostitutes who would not object to sex. I managed to wiggle my hands free and clasped them firmly between my legs. He was holding me by my shoulders and having a problem keeping me still, while at the same time moving my hands away. Each time he tried I wiggled and reasoned all the more. </p> <p>He had opened the buttons on his jeans. When I looked down I could see his penis. It was the first time I had ever seen an erection. As a small girl I had glimpsed my father's stubby penis once in the corridor and discussed with a schoolfriend a theory that short fat men had short fat ones and long thin men had long thin ones, a hypothesis based on our two fathers. When I was six someone's brother produced one. It reminded me of the tassels on the velour tablecloths old people still kept in their kitchens. But this man's penis was threatening and I was repulsed by it. </p> <p>He was becoming annoyed, but my matter-of-fact voice meant he kept getting drawn into conversation and this seemed to defuse things. I played for moments with words. Perhaps before time ran out someone would appear and save me. It was growing dark. We continued to shuffle on the earth and grass. Abruptly he announced that he would kill me and then have sex with me. This had not occurred to me. But my response was the absolutism of virginity. I had theorised myself into an intellectual rejection of virginity. But now I felt utter repugnance. I was not going to have this as my first experience of sex. Running out of conversational ideas, I inquired how he would be able to kill me. He replied that he was carrying a knife. Did I sense he was bluffing? \"Show me!\" I commanded, at which point he put back his head and roared with laughter. </p> <p>I felt the convulsion of his body and saw a white, hot, sticky liquid spreading over my black underskirt. I still had my hands protectively between my legs, but he was getting to his feet still laughing. I was bewildered by the sudden change of mood. He stood over me and congratulated me on my courage. I didn't think it was courage. I had resisted him because I couldn't bear not to. Even in shock I could see the irony. The man who a few minutes before had nearly choked and raped me was greeting me as a human being. </p> <p>Unlike others, who decided celibacy was the only dignified solution to the narrow choice of being either sheltered or seduced, my brush with rape and death galvanized me to overcome my shyness. I wanted to wipe out the bad memory of that erect penis on my black silky underskirt by meeting a man. </p> <p>One day my friend Tony reappeared in Paris; he was in particularly good spirits, as he was accompanied by his new love, Danielle. I must meet her and some art students from the Slade he had met the night before: \"You'll like them. They're really cool.\" </p> <p>I had never met any London art students but I was still Leeds enough to want to hold my end up with Londoners - cool or not cool. So I got dressed up in my smart beatnik outfit: high heels, black stockings, C&amp;A tight black jumper over a dark, pleated skirt in muted greys and blues, which I considered suitably subtle and interesting. </p> <p>Tony introduced first Barry, small with wispy blond hair and a puckish face, and then a dark, sturdy Geoff, who smiled a sensual grin. But it was Bernie Jennings, tall, skinny and pale-faced, like a harlequin in mourning, who provoked peculiar and unrecognisable sensations in me - something between an electric shock and being hit under the ribs. I was drawn to the shyness and pride as much as to the light brown fringe, long white face and black holey sweater. Over the years this kind of agitation would become recognisable as desire, but at just 18 I had no reference points, no compass to journey into passion. And I had been programmed since early adolescence to be desired, not to do the desiring. </p> <p>Intimidated by the cockney voices which prickled with class hostility, I resorted to a Yorkshire no-nonsense manner and teased them about their sunglasses. This cool had to have some cracks. I didn't realise that my outfit, which I imagined was a unique expression of my personality, made me look like a middle-class Hampstead person to Bernie and his friends. But they'd never met one with a Leeds accent and were completely thrown. </p> <p>I had rejected flirting as akin to that other no-no, prick-teasing, in the cerebral sexual code I had elaborated against convention. Now, annoyed with myself for feeling like a marshmallow, I dumped my own rules and, in extremity, began flirting defensively with Bernie. I was desperate to break through his surface detachment and my sexuality was edged with aggression. </p> <p>We all ambled off to eat couscous in the Rue de la Huchette, with Bernie explaining to the Algerian waiter in bad French that we were \"Parti Travailliste\" (Labour Party). I don't know what they made of the news that this band of odd-looking English were on the side of the workers, but they saw he was trying to be friends and gave us sweet, sticky, delicious honey cakes. By then Bernie and I had entered into a wordless conspiracy to lose everyone else. </p> <p>Finally alone, we meandered together into a modern jazz club. We couldn't afford to go downstairs but sat upstairs in the brown, wooden-walled room on a bench, making one drink last for ever. As the music floated up the stairs we sat in silence, listening hard, until the straining notes seemed to be playing from inside my head. Little by little we kept edging closer. I could just feel his shoulder. This slight touch became overwhelming. We were being carried together into some timeless zone, beyond reason, outside day-to-day experiencing. </p> <p>But time had passed nonetheless. They were putting the chairs on the tables. It must have been around two in the morning when we found ourselves breathing the chilly night air outside. I shivered. We wandered through Paris all that night, behaving like classic lovers while pretending to ignore the cold. I had no idea how to get home after the last metro went and was anyway far too nervous to suggest it. Bernie shared a tiny hotel room with Geoff and Barry; we couldn't go back there. Eventually, tired, drained and hungry in the dawn, we huddled over a coffee in Les Halles, desire on hold and overlaid by the shouts of the market men. </p> <p> Neither of us was sure what to do next. I gazed at him, sheepish and uncertain. When you blew all the rules, how did you make a move? \"We could meditate,\" he said, showing me how to sit cross-legged on the bed. Neither of us wanted to meditate. He drew me to him and undid my bra. A diffuse arousal spun around my body. \"I'm a virgin,\" I said, clumsy, sensing he assumed I knew more about what was happening than I did. He was incredulous. How could anyone be a virgin at 18! Girls he knew in Bermondsey were never virgins by then. I'd never been to Bermondsey, but immediately endowed it with drama and life in the raw. Impossible to explain about Roundhay or Hunmanby; how could he comprehend the peculiar difficulties of losing your virginity in such conditions? He offered to take me to the metro. </p> <p>Bernie, at 20, appeared to invent how to behave in every encounter he made. He looked out at the world like no one I had ever met. Through his eyes the ordinary became extraordinary, the mundane miraculous. \"You have such a capacity to wonder,\" Bernie announced once out of the blue. I didn't tell him this was called being gormless in Yorkshire. He informed me that beauty could be seen everywhere, pointing to the corner of an advertisement or the patterns left by his espresso coffee on the side of the cup. I was surprised; I'd thought it was in art galleries or Swedish-designed teapots. </p> <p>Bernie and I eventually managed to make our way back to the Seizi\u00e8me the night before I was to leave on a visit to the Loire. I had known him for one week. It felt much, much longer. </p> <p>I smuggled him nervously past the concierge, who was luckily snoozing. Up we went in the cranking, creaking little lift, which always had a peculiar effect on my bladder - perhaps because it seemed so unlikely that the ancient thing would make it to the top floor. I opened the door of the little room with its cold mosaic floor, the bidet, the bed, the dresser and my postcards. \"Quite a picture gallery you've got here,\" he remarked sardonically, making me want to tear them off the wall. Before he crossed its threshold, nothing had happened in that room. It had been my ascetic cell, where I read or slept or ate bread and yoghurt, watching the elaborate lives and brightly striped sun chairs of a rich French family in the flat across the road. </p> <p>In bed Bernie produced a crinkled brown object. This antique sheath was so ugly it appalled me. Ignorant and unpractical, I declared I didn't want him to use it and stuffed it under the pillow. I felt a moment of fear. Would I find his penis repellent? I looked down anxiously. There it was, just part of him, part of the skinny body that was utterly unthreatening. I wanted his closeness, loved the touch of him as we embraced. But sex remained a puzzle. Was it just this moving up and down? After all that worrying about your shape, your lipstick, your clothes; after all that prohibiting and whispering and all that longing? Was this it then, backwards and forwards? Could losing your virginity be a kind of non-event? What about all those DH Lawrence explosions? Was this really not being a virgin any more? I was far too shy to ask Bernie. Anyway, while he slept I was lying there with other worries. This was the first time since I was a child that I had slept without rollers in my hair. What on earth would I look like in the morning? To my surprise, I didn't look much different. </p> <p>I left him asleep in my single iron bed and hurried away, late and flustered, to meet a crew-cut American student who had offered to drive me to the Loire on a scooter. In the metro window I could see my reflection. I smiled the secret smile of a satisfied sinner. These other people in the carriage could not possibly imagine! If it had been yesterday they would have been sitting with a virgin. A unique, momentous divide of before and after had occurred in my life. Or had it? </p> <p><strong> 1968</strong></p> <p> The night before the March 17 anti-Vietnam War demonstration, the Vietnam Solidarity Committee called a meeting to discuss tactics. Members of the anti-authoritarian German student movement had come over and were clustering at the back of the hall. Having been engaged in a series of confrontations with heavy German police, they were held in considerable esteem and we all spun round to watch them show how to make a human wedge to break through police lines. The other demonstration tactic introduced by the Germans that March was linking arms and chanting, \"Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh\". </p> <p>On the day the demonstration had the buzz of a big march - around 25,000 people were there. It fizzed with defiance from the start, as we distributed leaflets with Gerald Scarfe's grotesque cartoon of the \"Special Relationship\" - a lapdog Harold Wilson licking Lyndon Johnson's arse. Its ethos contrasted with CND's \"We the good people bearing witness\" style. We were more angry than good, and far less passive than was customary on British CND demonstrations, pushing against the police lines, arms linked at Grosvenor Square. I was briefly at the front and saw a few demonstrators get through the police lines and run towards the embassy. I pushed, but not too hard, because the police were really beating isolated demonstrators behind the lines with their truncheons. Then the horses started going right through the crowd, driving people back and sideways and trampling them in the crush. The police seemed to go mad. I suspect they were taken aback by behaviour they had not predicted. </p> <p>It was still the case, though, that a demonstration in Britain was not synonymous in most people's minds with a violent clash with the police. Most people came dressed for a walk through London, not a battle. On March 18, the newspapers were plastered with a photograph of a young woman struggling as the police carried her off. Her skirt was pulled up to reveal stockings, suspenders and underpants. The hand of the policeman was raised. \"Spanked\" was the salacious headline. </p> <p>The mood of desperate frustration was tempered by an awareness of the need to break through what seemed like a universally hostile media. The innovative Americans in the anti-war Stop It Committee came up with a plan to drop the slogan \"Oxbridge paddles while Vietnam burns\" over a bridge during the Oxford and Cambridge boat race, thus catching the TV cameras and millions of viewers. We were all to arrive as individual spectators, each with a letter on a cloth banner concealed about our person. When we reached the river, however, it was evident that police were privy to the Stop It Committee's plans, for they had cut off access to the bridge. Conferring hastily, while trying to appear nonchalant, we settled for the riverbank. As the boats approached, we clutched the banners under our coats, then - whoosh! - out they came. We'd done it! </p> <p>Jubilant and excited, we hurried back to our friend Wisty Hoyland, who had been watching the boat race on TV. Wisty announced ruefully that, yes, our banners had shown up, but we had forgotten about the direction of the camera following the boats. As a result we had reached millions with the challenging anagram snrub manteiv elihw selddap egdirbxo. It was shades of Czechoslovakia backwards. </p> <p><strong> 1969</strong></p> <p> I landed bang in the middle of a communications problem of my own when Jean-Luc Godard offered to include Agit Prop, the radical cultural network that I was involved with, in British Sounds, in a film he was making for London Weekend Television. Aiming to catch specific instances of left organising and consciousness, Godard had decided he wanted to use my Black Dwarf article on women. He aimed to do an Oz in reverse. His idea was to film me with nothing on reciting words of emancipation as I walked up and down a flight of stairs - the supposition being that eventually the voice would override the images of the body. This proposal made me uneasy, for two quite different reasons. I was a 36C and considered my breasts to be too floppy for the 60s fashion. Being photographed lying down with nothing on was fine, but walking down stairs could be embarrassing. Moreover, while I didn't think nudity was a problem in itself, the early women's groups were against what we called \"objectification\". New and powerful images were being projected all around us in the media. Contesting how we were represented had been one of the sources of our rebellion. Where did you draw the line over images? Why on earth did the pesky male mind jump so quickly from talk of liberation to nudity, I wondered? On the other hand, Agit Prop needed to move out of John and Wisty Hoyland's house, because they had a new baby. We were trying to raise money for an office. </p> <p>Godard came out to Hackney to convince me. He sat on the sanded floor of my bedroom, a slight dark man, his body coiled in persuasive knots. Neither Godard the man nor Godard the mythical creator of A Bout de Souffle, were easy to contend with. I perched on the edge of my bed and announced, \"I think if there's a woman with nothing on appearing on the screen no one's going to listen to any words\", suggesting perhaps he could film our \"This Exploits Women\" stickers on the tube. Godard gave me a baleful look, his lip curled. \"Don't you think I am able to make a cunt boring?\" he exclaimed. We were locked in conflict over a fleeting ethnographic moment. </p> <p>In the end a compromise was settled. The Electric Cinema had recently opened in Notting Hill and needed money. A young woman (with small breasts) from there agreed to walk up and down the stairs and I did the voice-over. When British Sounds was shown in France, Charlie Posner told me the audience cheered as I declared, \"They tell us what we are... One is simply not conscious of 'men' writers, of 'men' film-makers. They are just 'writers', just 'film-makers'. The reflected image for women they create will be taken straight by women themselves. These characters 'are' women.\" As for Godard's intention for making a cunt boring, I cannot say, except that a friend in International Socialism told me that his first thought had been \"crumpet\" - until the shot went on and on and on, and he started to listen. </p> <p>British Sounds was to have an unexpected series of repercussions that I did not grasp at the time. Humphrey Burton, then head of arts at London Weekend Television, refused to show it. The ensuing row fused with the sacking of Michael Peacock from the board of LWT, in September 1969. Whereupon Tony Garnett and Kenith Trodd along with other programme-makers, resigned in protest. LWT decided to go for higher ratings and brought in an Australian newspaper owner called Rupert Murdoch. The last thing he wanted to do was to make a cunt boring </p> <p>\u00a9 Sheila Rowbotham, 2000. </p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract from Promise Of A Dream: Remembering The Sixties, by Sheila Rowbotham, to be published by Penguin on Monday, priced \u00a318.99.</p>",

      "bodyText": "1961 In early 1961, 17-year-old Sheila set off from Leeds for Paris, to study at the Sorbonne for a few months before starting her degree in England As the taxi from the airport headed towards the Latin Quarter and my room in a cheap hotel, I watched the meter anxiously. My sense of cities was still measured through Leeds, but Paris went on and on. Suddenly young people were spilling over the pavements of the Boulevard St Michel, their clothes signalling \"French students\". The hooting din all around, accompanied by shouted altercations through car windows and much waving of arms, amazed me. This was definitely not Leeds. I was in France! I sat back, relaxed and breathed freedom, preparing to transmogrify into a cross between Juliette Greco and Brigitte Bardot. But it was still me looking into the mirror of a small hotel room, the red hair I was intent on growing falling in two wings over my brow, the pink of my cheeks blotted out with pale make-up, which also concealed my lips, while two black existentialist lines accentuated my eyes. I sucked in my cheeks, sighing at my failure to look at all gaunt and raddled. Whereupon I turned to the making of my new ambience, unpacking my white \"modern\" fibreglass case and pinning up my postcards of Picasso's blue period and Toulouse-Lautrec, cultural treasures from a school trip to the Louvre. Then I drew back the shutters and looked out over the roofs. I was free - and terribly lonely. I would wander alone around the Left Bank, leafing through the second-hand bookstalls by the Seine, staring at the windows of little shops full of strange objects from Africa, visiting art galleries or laughing to myself at the Ionesco one-act plays in the tiny Th\u00e9tre de la Huchette. Monsieur at the reception desk was all insinuating smiles as I came and went. However, Madame regarded me with stony disapproval. Alone for long periods for the first time in my life, I drew on the inner world I had acquired secretly in defiance of the routines and enforced collectivity of boarding school. I imagined myself as unique; in fact, I was an entirely predictable cultural phenomenon. The Left Bank was full of young Britons and Americans drifting through Paris searching for traces of 40s existentialists. I was in pursuit of profound philosophising, but not only was I drawing blanks with my endeavours to find Parisian intellectuals, it was even proving impossible to reflect alone. No sooner had I settled on a bench or down by the quais than I would hear a voice in my ear making sexual propositions. I would scowl and try to sound gruff, but I was not really sure how to be gruff in French. Such incidents were generally annoying rather than alarming. Terror in a city was utterly unfamiliar to me. You could wander around in Leeds at that time without fear. After a month or so, I tried to copy the Parisian women, walking around head held high, without meeting anyone in the eye, and thus achieved a measure of city-type mobility. But it didn't come naturally, as I remained nosy, keen to know about everyone I encountered. This boundary-less curiosity kept getting me into trouble, but it didn't stop me wanting to migrate into the souls of strangers. The collision of assumptions I was encountering was not about sex alone. I had arrived in Paris just after the referendum in which the majority in France, weary of the colonial war, had voted for Algerian self-determination. That February, French settlers in Algeria, who were bitterly opposed to Algerian independence, had secretly formed the Organisation de l'Alg\u00e9rie Secr\u00e8te, the OAS. They were preparing to take up arms against General de Gaulle's government. My knowledge of the French political situation was hazy and abstract. I had read an exposure of French torture in Algeria, but was confused, knowing that Sartre and Camus, my cultural heroes, had been in opposing camps. As I walked past Algerians held at machine-gun point in the street by the \"flics\", I would feel a mute personal sympathy for victims with whom I vaguely identified. Yet in the cafes and the streets, it was the North African workers in France who would be my most persistent sexual tormentors. \"Tu aimes les Arabes?\" inquired Dominique, one of the French students I had met, when I confided my anxieties. Perched on a high stool in a cafe on the Boulevard St Michel, she spat out the word \"Arabes\" like a shot of concentrated bile. Her words made me flinch. They conjured up my father booming across the dining-room table about the British Raj, \"We built them the railroads.\" I was startled to hear someone of my own age echoing my father. From Suez in 1956, I had come to regard colonialism as outmoded and irrational. Former British colonies were gaining independence and pragmatic Conservatives such as Harold Macmillan were prepared to accept the \"wind of change\". My recoil, however, came not so much from any political response, but rather from a psychological repugnance against categorising people as inhuman, which was deeply rooted in childhood. My mother possessed the snobberies of her middle-class upbringing, but nonetheless had persistently challenged my father's verdicts on India and ridiculed the anti-Semitism that was rife in Leeds. The only time she had ever slapped me was when I came home from school aged around seven and parroted, \"She's a Catholic\" about a girl in my class called Margaret. \"Never say that about anyone.\" And I knew she was right. I liked Margaret. I had been mimicking the voice of the crowd, which I knew from experience could support the class bully. I looked at the pretty Parisienne opposite me with antagonism and resolved not to meet her again. Whereupon, with a toss of her brown curls, she admonished me, \"You must slap them in the face. Only then do they know that you don't want them.\" Despite my emotional abhorrence and regardless of liberal reason, her words hit the buried resentment that had accumulated from all those encounters with the men who had pestered me. I left her troubled and uneasy. My father had hired a Leeds removal firm called Turnbulls to deliver my school trunk. Unused to international transactions, the Leeds company sent it to a freight company's office on the outskirts of Paris. My journey to collect it took me to the end of the metro line, to arrive in a strange no-man's-land of half-built skyscrapers and partially-built roads surrounded by rough open ground where new suburbs were being built. As I had never been to the edge of the city and was uncertain where to go, I asked an old woman the way and was a little troubled when she hailed a young North African man, who nodded confidently and said he would show me. I looked at him searchingly. He was tall, around 23, with Brylcreemed hair and a moustache, wearing labourer's jeans. I was not sure what to do, but the politeness ingrained into my petit-bourgeois being, combined with my dislike of Dominique's attitudes, overcame my wariness. It was broad daylight, the old woman had approached him, he was being helpful. Anyway, how else was I going to find my trunk? I hesitated for a second and then followed him. He led me off the dirt road along a maze of paths through the building site. As we walked and walked, I began to suspect that we were going round in circles. Worried, I looked around. How was I to extricate myself? Who else could I ask? My companion, however, was courteous and reassuring. We arrived at a cafe. Did I want a drink. \"Non, non.\" However, he had a wine and insisted on getting me something. I had an espresso. We resumed our walking. Another cafe. I had an espresso. He insisted on paying. As we left he began asking me, \"Tu veux pisser.\" \"Non, non,\" I replied. Why was he going on about the toilet? School French had not included slang. \"Tu veux pisser.\" \"Non, non.\" I replied emphatically. I was getting seriously worried. Twilight was falling and I was completely lost in a wasteland. I knew I had to get away from this man. I was going to have to admit failure and give up on the trunk for today. Sounding as decisive as I could, I announced it was time for me to go home. Please would he show me the bus stop? He seemed to concur and said he had to ask someone the way. He headed off across a field. I stumbled after him over the uneven ground, the long heels of my stilettos sinking into the earth. We were in the middle of waste land when he turned round suddenly, grabbed me hard on the shoulder, bent his face towards mine and tried to kiss me. Dominique's confident pronouncement pierced through blind panic and I slapped him decisively on the cheek. His surprise gained me a second. He loosened his grip. I began to run over the mix of earth and grass. There were some shacks in the next field. I could hear music. Perhaps I could reach people and safety. My shoe came off. I stumbled and fell, and as I tried to get up he came towards me. I was scrambling on all fours over the ground in terror with my shoe in my hand. Then he was on top of me, holding me down. I tried to stab the pointed heel into his head, but he easily grabbed my hand, forcing my arm back. A peculiar relief flooded through me; even in these circumstances the possibility of wounding someone horrified me. I was struggling so desperately I managed to pull both of us a little way over the ground. But he was not letting go of me. I screamed. I was sure the men in the huts could hear. No one took any notice. He put his hand over my mouth, then his hands were round my neck, holding me down with his body. I kept wriggling and screaming. I could feel his hands tightening around my neck and saw my own panic reflected back in his eyes. \"I'm going to die,\" I thought. This had not been how I had imagined my life at all. \"I'm only 18. I've had no time to live.\" Then instead of terror an extraordinary clarity swept through my consciousness - all those black coffees and the adrenaline of fear. \"This man is much stronger than you physically,\" said a voice in my head. \"Stop struggling. Use your wits. You've been luckier than him in life. Fight him with the reason you've learned from being educated. Use the weapons of your privilege.\" Abruptly I stopped screaming and went still. His grip on my neck loosened. I began to make an elaborate and rational case. Raping me was unwise and would result in unnecessary trouble for him. The French authorities were very strict about North Africans in France. My father was a rich and powerful man in England and would pursue him in vengeance. I was a virgin. There were plenty of prostitutes who would not object to sex. I managed to wiggle my hands free and clasped them firmly between my legs. He was holding me by my shoulders and having a problem keeping me still, while at the same time moving my hands away. Each time he tried I wiggled and reasoned all the more. He had opened the buttons on his jeans. When I looked down I could see his penis. It was the first time I had ever seen an erection. As a small girl I had glimpsed my father's stubby penis once in the corridor and discussed with a schoolfriend a theory that short fat men had short fat ones and long thin men had long thin ones, a hypothesis based on our two fathers. When I was six someone's brother produced one. It reminded me of the tassels on the velour tablecloths old people still kept in their kitchens. But this man's penis was threatening and I was repulsed by it. He was becoming annoyed, but my matter-of-fact voice meant he kept getting drawn into conversation and this seemed to defuse things. I played for moments with words. Perhaps before time ran out someone would appear and save me. It was growing dark. We continued to shuffle on the earth and grass. Abruptly he announced that he would kill me and then have sex with me. This had not occurred to me. But my response was the absolutism of virginity. I had theorised myself into an intellectual rejection of virginity. But now I felt utter repugnance. I was not going to have this as my first experience of sex. Running out of conversational ideas, I inquired how he would be able to kill me. He replied that he was carrying a knife. Did I sense he was bluffing? \"Show me!\" I commanded, at which point he put back his head and roared with laughter. I felt the convulsion of his body and saw a white, hot, sticky liquid spreading over my black underskirt. I still had my hands protectively between my legs, but he was getting to his feet still laughing. I was bewildered by the sudden change of mood. He stood over me and congratulated me on my courage. I didn't think it was courage. I had resisted him because I couldn't bear not to. Even in shock I could see the irony. The man who a few minutes before had nearly choked and raped me was greeting me as a human being. Unlike others, who decided celibacy was the only dignified solution to the narrow choice of being either sheltered or seduced, my brush with rape and death galvanized me to overcome my shyness. I wanted to wipe out the bad memory of that erect penis on my black silky underskirt by meeting a man. One day my friend Tony reappeared in Paris; he was in particularly good spirits, as he was accompanied by his new love, Danielle. I must meet her and some art students from the Slade he had met the night before: \"You'll like them. They're really cool.\" I had never met any London art students but I was still Leeds enough to want to hold my end up with Londoners - cool or not cool. So I got dressed up in my smart beatnik outfit: high heels, black stockings, C&amp;A tight black jumper over a dark, pleated skirt in muted greys and blues, which I considered suitably subtle and interesting. Tony introduced first Barry, small with wispy blond hair and a puckish face, and then a dark, sturdy Geoff, who smiled a sensual grin. But it was Bernie Jennings, tall, skinny and pale-faced, like a harlequin in mourning, who provoked peculiar and unrecognisable sensations in me - something between an electric shock and being hit under the ribs. I was drawn to the shyness and pride as much as to the light brown fringe, long white face and black holey sweater. Over the years this kind of agitation would become recognisable as desire, but at just 18 I had no reference points, no compass to journey into passion. And I had been programmed since early adolescence to be desired, not to do the desiring. Intimidated by the cockney voices which prickled with class hostility, I resorted to a Yorkshire no-nonsense manner and teased them about their sunglasses. This cool had to have some cracks. I didn't realise that my outfit, which I imagined was a unique expression of my personality, made me look like a middle-class Hampstead person to Bernie and his friends. But they'd never met one with a Leeds accent and were completely thrown. I had rejected flirting as akin to that other no-no, prick-teasing, in the cerebral sexual code I had elaborated against convention. Now, annoyed with myself for feeling like a marshmallow, I dumped my own rules and, in extremity, began flirting defensively with Bernie. I was desperate to break through his surface detachment and my sexuality was edged with aggression. We all ambled off to eat couscous in the Rue de la Huchette, with Bernie explaining to the Algerian waiter in bad French that we were \"Parti Travailliste\" (Labour Party). I don't know what they made of the news that this band of odd-looking English were on the side of the workers, but they saw he was trying to be friends and gave us sweet, sticky, delicious honey cakes. By then Bernie and I had entered into a wordless conspiracy to lose everyone else. Finally alone, we meandered together into a modern jazz club. We couldn't afford to go downstairs but sat upstairs in the brown, wooden-walled room on a bench, making one drink last for ever. As the music floated up the stairs we sat in silence, listening hard, until the straining notes seemed to be playing from inside my head. Little by little we kept edging closer. I could just feel his shoulder. This slight touch became overwhelming. We were being carried together into some timeless zone, beyond reason, outside day-to-day experiencing. But time had passed nonetheless. They were putting the chairs on the tables. It must have been around two in the morning when we found ourselves breathing the chilly night air outside. I shivered. We wandered through Paris all that night, behaving like classic lovers while pretending to ignore the cold. I had no idea how to get home after the last metro went and was anyway far too nervous to suggest it. Bernie shared a tiny hotel room with Geoff and Barry; we couldn't go back there. Eventually, tired, drained and hungry in the dawn, we huddled over a coffee in Les Halles, desire on hold and overlaid by the shouts of the market men. Neither of us was sure what to do next. I gazed at him, sheepish and uncertain. When you blew all the rules, how did you make a move? \"We could meditate,\" he said, showing me how to sit cross-legged on the bed. Neither of us wanted to meditate. He drew me to him and undid my bra. A diffuse arousal spun around my body. \"I'm a virgin,\" I said, clumsy, sensing he assumed I knew more about what was happening than I did. He was incredulous. How could anyone be a virgin at 18! Girls he knew in Bermondsey were never virgins by then. I'd never been to Bermondsey, but immediately endowed it with drama and life in the raw. Impossible to explain about Roundhay or Hunmanby; how could he comprehend the peculiar difficulties of losing your virginity in such conditions? He offered to take me to the metro. Bernie, at 20, appeared to invent how to behave in every encounter he made. He looked out at the world like no one I had ever met. Through his eyes the ordinary became extraordinary, the mundane miraculous. \"You have such a capacity to wonder,\" Bernie announced once out of the blue. I didn't tell him this was called being gormless in Yorkshire. He informed me that beauty could be seen everywhere, pointing to the corner of an advertisement or the patterns left by his espresso coffee on the side of the cup. I was surprised; I'd thought it was in art galleries or Swedish-designed teapots. Bernie and I eventually managed to make our way back to the Seizi\u00e8me the night before I was to leave on a visit to the Loire. I had known him for one week. It felt much, much longer. I smuggled him nervously past the concierge, who was luckily snoozing. Up we went in the cranking, creaking little lift, which always had a peculiar effect on my bladder - perhaps because it seemed so unlikely that the ancient thing would make it to the top floor. I opened the door of the little room with its cold mosaic floor, the bidet, the bed, the dresser and my postcards. \"Quite a picture gallery you've got here,\" he remarked sardonically, making me want to tear them off the wall. Before he crossed its threshold, nothing had happened in that room. It had been my ascetic cell, where I read or slept or ate bread and yoghurt, watching the elaborate lives and brightly striped sun chairs of a rich French family in the flat across the road. In bed Bernie produced a crinkled brown object. This antique sheath was so ugly it appalled me. Ignorant and unpractical, I declared I didn't want him to use it and stuffed it under the pillow. I felt a moment of fear. Would I find his penis repellent? I looked down anxiously. There it was, just part of him, part of the skinny body that was utterly unthreatening. I wanted his closeness, loved the touch of him as we embraced. But sex remained a puzzle. Was it just this moving up and down? After all that worrying about your shape, your lipstick, your clothes; after all that prohibiting and whispering and all that longing? Was this it then, backwards and forwards? Could losing your virginity be a kind of non-event? What about all those DH Lawrence explosions? Was this really not being a virgin any more? I was far too shy to ask Bernie. Anyway, while he slept I was lying there with other worries. This was the first time since I was a child that I had slept without rollers in my hair. What on earth would I look like in the morning? To my surprise, I didn't look much different. I left him asleep in my single iron bed and hurried away, late and flustered, to meet a crew-cut American student who had offered to drive me to the Loire on a scooter. In the metro window I could see my reflection. I smiled the secret smile of a satisfied sinner. These other people in the carriage could not possibly imagine! If it had been yesterday they would have been sitting with a virgin. A unique, momentous divide of before and after had occurred in my life. Or had it? 1968 The night before the March 17 anti-Vietnam War demonstration, the Vietnam Solidarity Committee called a meeting to discuss tactics. Members of the anti-authoritarian German student movement had come over and were clustering at the back of the hall. Having been engaged in a series of confrontations with heavy German police, they were held in considerable esteem and we all spun round to watch them show how to make a human wedge to break through police lines. The other demonstration tactic introduced by the Germans that March was linking arms and chanting, \"Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh\". On the day the demonstration had the buzz of a big march - around 25,000 people were there. It fizzed with defiance from the start, as we distributed leaflets with Gerald Scarfe's grotesque cartoon of the \"Special Relationship\" - a lapdog Harold Wilson licking Lyndon Johnson's arse. Its ethos contrasted with CND's \"We the good people bearing witness\" style. We were more angry than good, and far less passive than was customary on British CND demonstrations, pushing against the police lines, arms linked at Grosvenor Square. I was briefly at the front and saw a few demonstrators get through the police lines and run towards the embassy. I pushed, but not too hard, because the police were really beating isolated demonstrators behind the lines with their truncheons. Then the horses started going right through the crowd, driving people back and sideways and trampling them in the crush. The police seemed to go mad. I suspect they were taken aback by behaviour they had not predicted. It was still the case, though, that a demonstration in Britain was not synonymous in most people's minds with a violent clash with the police. Most people came dressed for a walk through London, not a battle. On March 18, the newspapers were plastered with a photograph of a young woman struggling as the police carried her off. Her skirt was pulled up to reveal stockings, suspenders and underpants. The hand of the policeman was raised. \"Spanked\" was the salacious headline. The mood of desperate frustration was tempered by an awareness of the need to break through what seemed like a universally hostile media. The innovative Americans in the anti-war Stop It Committee came up with a plan to drop the slogan \"Oxbridge paddles while Vietnam burns\" over a bridge during the Oxford and Cambridge boat race, thus catching the TV cameras and millions of viewers. We were all to arrive as individual spectators, each with a letter on a cloth banner concealed about our person. When we reached the river, however, it was evident that police were privy to the Stop It Committee's plans, for they had cut off access to the bridge. Conferring hastily, while trying to appear nonchalant, we settled for the riverbank. As the boats approached, we clutched the banners under our coats, then - whoosh! - out they came. We'd done it! Jubilant and excited, we hurried back to our friend Wisty Hoyland, who had been watching the boat race on TV. Wisty announced ruefully that, yes, our banners had shown up, but we had forgotten about the direction of the camera following the boats. As a result we had reached millions with the challenging anagram snrub manteiv elihw selddap egdirbxo. It was shades of Czechoslovakia backwards. 1969 I landed bang in the middle of a communications problem of my own when Jean-Luc Godard offered to include Agit Prop, the radical cultural network that I was involved with, in British Sounds, in a film he was making for London Weekend Television. Aiming to catch specific instances of left organising and consciousness, Godard had decided he wanted to use my Black Dwarf article on women. He aimed to do an Oz in reverse. His idea was to film me with nothing on reciting words of emancipation as I walked up and down a flight of stairs - the supposition being that eventually the voice would override the images of the body. This proposal made me uneasy, for two quite different reasons. I was a 36C and considered my breasts to be too floppy for the 60s fashion. Being photographed lying down with nothing on was fine, but walking down stairs could be embarrassing. Moreover, while I didn't think nudity was a problem in itself, the early women's groups were against what we called \"objectification\". New and powerful images were being projected all around us in the media. Contesting how we were represented had been one of the sources of our rebellion. Where did you draw the line over images? Why on earth did the pesky male mind jump so quickly from talk of liberation to nudity, I wondered? On the other hand, Agit Prop needed to move out of John and Wisty Hoyland's house, because they had a new baby. We were trying to raise money for an office. Godard came out to Hackney to convince me. He sat on the sanded floor of my bedroom, a slight dark man, his body coiled in persuasive knots. Neither Godard the man nor Godard the mythical creator of A Bout de Souffle, were easy to contend with. I perched on the edge of my bed and announced, \"I think if there's a woman with nothing on appearing on the screen no one's going to listen to any words\", suggesting perhaps he could film our \"This Exploits Women\" stickers on the tube. Godard gave me a baleful look, his lip curled. \"Don't you think I am able to make a cunt boring?\" he exclaimed. We were locked in conflict over a fleeting ethnographic moment. In the end a compromise was settled. The Electric Cinema had recently opened in Notting Hill and needed money. A young woman (with small breasts) from there agreed to walk up and down the stairs and I did the voice-over. When British Sounds was shown in France, Charlie Posner told me the audience cheered as I declared, \"They tell us what we are... One is simply not conscious of 'men' writers, of 'men' film-makers. They are just 'writers', just 'film-makers'. The reflected image for women they create will be taken straight by women themselves. These characters 'are' women.\" As for Godard's intention for making a cunt boring, I cannot say, except that a friend in International Socialism told me that his first thought had been \"crumpet\" - until the shot went on and on and on, and he started to listen. British Sounds was to have an unexpected series of repercussions that I did not grasp at the time. Humphrey Burton, then head of arts at London Weekend Television, refused to show it. The ensuing row fused with the sacking of Michael Peacock from the board of LWT, in September 1969. Whereupon Tony Garnett and Kenith Trodd along with other programme-makers, resigned in protest. LWT decided to go for higher ratings and brought in an Australian newspaper owner called Rupert Murdoch. The last thing he wanted to do was to make a cunt boring \u00a9 Sheila Rowbotham, 2000. \u0095 This is an edited extract from Promise Of A Dream: Remembering The Sixties, by Sheila Rowbotham, to be published by Penguin on Monday, priced \u00a318.99.",

      "body": "<p>I was recently invited to organise a wine tasting for a small group of citizens in the cellars of London's Cafe Royal, but when the Cafe's wine list arrived in the post, I was horrifed. I had anticipated, rather naively, that we would be tasting some of the venerable vintages that the Cafe has in its cellars, when in fact it was only those wines on the restaurant list, which was overly pricy and desperately uninspiring. Asda came to my rescue, and provided the wines for free, two of them marvellous 17-pointers. </p> <p>The first was Asda's own-label Manzanilla (17 points, out of 20, \u00a34.97), which is an individually fruity - perhaps vegetal is a more accurate word - sherry with a tea-leaf edginess. It is an aromatic wine of charm and unusual, if subtle, richness. Well-textured and soft (not as bone-dry as most manzanillas, but no less characterful), it is so approachable that it might well convert those who, in the past, have found the uncompromising style of this wine austere. This specimen is one of the planet's most civilised summer aperitifs, especially when well-chilled in the glass. </p> <p>One of the reds at the Cafe tasting was 35 Sur Cabernet Sauvignon 1999 (17 points, \u00a34.49), from Chile, which went down gloriously with the audience, more so when that price-tag was revealed. Dark, rich, firm yet supple, wonderfully fruity (leather, spice, blackcurrants) and hugely lingering, it provides a generous mouthful. </p> <p>One Asda red not at the tasting was the organic Bonterra Cabernet Sauvignon 1997 (17 points, \u00a38.99), which is a quintessential California-style red: warm, rich, pulsating, brilliantly and lushly tannic, with energetic, ripe yet serious dry-sweet fruit and the ineffable elegance that this state's finest cabernets effortlessly offer. </p> <p>I had hoped to galvanise the cellar staff by bringing in a three-litre wine box, but I was advised that the shock might be too great and so we stuck with bottles. As it happens, I've tasted a good few wine boxes recently. Some are bland, it's true, but others are well worth investigating. Sainsbury's, for example, has two terrific boxes. They are Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon (15.5 points, \u00a311.99) and Chilean Cabernet Merlot (16 points, \u00a315.49). The Bulgar offers a sedate, velvety texture with an undertone of typical cabernet, bell-pepper dryness - an excellent study in bargain fruit, sufficiently meaty and well-formed to please any wine drinker (and at 50p a glass, too). The Chilean is even smarter, being the best boxed red wine I've tasted. It has oodles of flavour, all toffeed and blackcurranty, with good acids and fine tannins. It is both a satisfying food wine and a great quaffing partner. </p> <p>Sainsbury's also has an abundance of interesting bottles. Inycon Syrah 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99), from Sicily, is vibrant, saucy, sexy, with beautifully harnessed tannins allied to compressed fruit. It's a terrific fiver's-worth of Mediteranean-style syrah. Bellingham Merlot 1998 (16 points, \u00a35.99), from South Africa, has a curious, pear-drop undertone to rich, dry fruit that redefines merlot's mouthwatering deliciousness. Merlot Vin de Pays de la Cit\u00e9 de Carcassonne Caroline de Beaulieu 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a33.99) has a spicy, baked-fruit aroma leading to some stunning, herby, hedgerow-fruited richness. It has a refined rusticity of impact and good manners. Ch\u00e2teau Haut de la Pierri\u00e8re C\u00f4tes de Castillon 1998 (16 points, \u00a35.49) is a marvellous claret of substance and warmth, and parades gripping tannins with chocolate and cassis fruit. Alteza 750 Tempranillo (16 points, \u00a34.49), from Spain, raises a provocative question: why drink expensive Rioja when there is this compelling reason to spend so much less and get so much more? It has gorgeous fruit that stays firm and dry even as it strikes with such vivacity. Old Git Grenache Syrah 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a33.99) is a daffy name, but a highly drinkable red. I'm bound to be tickled by that name, edging as I am towards old gitness myself, and the dry, Midi fruit is rounded and gluggable. </p> <p>Last, Sainsbury's Bulgarian Merlot (15.5 points, \u00a32.99) is also massively drinkable, but suffers from presenting one of the world's naffer labels. The bottle contains purple fruit of style and wit, but many a drinker will trundle past and ignore it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I was recently invited to organise a wine tasting for a small group of citizens in the cellars of London's Cafe Royal, but when the Cafe's wine list arrived in the post, I was horrifed. I had anticipated, rather naively, that we would be tasting some of the venerable vintages that the Cafe has in its cellars, when in fact it was only those wines on the restaurant list, which was overly pricy and desperately uninspiring. Asda came to my rescue, and provided the wines for free, two of them marvellous 17-pointers. The first was Asda's own-label Manzanilla (17 points, out of 20, \u00a34.97), which is an individually fruity - perhaps vegetal is a more accurate word - sherry with a tea-leaf edginess. It is an aromatic wine of charm and unusual, if subtle, richness. Well-textured and soft (not as bone-dry as most manzanillas, but no less characterful), it is so approachable that it might well convert those who, in the past, have found the uncompromising style of this wine austere. This specimen is one of the planet's most civilised summer aperitifs, especially when well-chilled in the glass. One of the reds at the Cafe tasting was 35 Sur Cabernet Sauvignon 1999 (17 points, \u00a34.49), from Chile, which went down gloriously with the audience, more so when that price-tag was revealed. Dark, rich, firm yet supple, wonderfully fruity (leather, spice, blackcurrants) and hugely lingering, it provides a generous mouthful. One Asda red not at the tasting was the organic Bonterra Cabernet Sauvignon 1997 (17 points, \u00a38.99), which is a quintessential California-style red: warm, rich, pulsating, brilliantly and lushly tannic, with energetic, ripe yet serious dry-sweet fruit and the ineffable elegance that this state's finest cabernets effortlessly offer. I had hoped to galvanise the cellar staff by bringing in a three-litre wine box, but I was advised that the shock might be too great and so we stuck with bottles. As it happens, I've tasted a good few wine boxes recently. Some are bland, it's true, but others are well worth investigating. Sainsbury's, for example, has two terrific boxes. They are Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon (15.5 points, \u00a311.99) and Chilean Cabernet Merlot (16 points, \u00a315.49). The Bulgar offers a sedate, velvety texture with an undertone of typical cabernet, bell-pepper dryness - an excellent study in bargain fruit, sufficiently meaty and well-formed to please any wine drinker (and at 50p a glass, too). The Chilean is even smarter, being the best boxed red wine I've tasted. It has oodles of flavour, all toffeed and blackcurranty, with good acids and fine tannins. It is both a satisfying food wine and a great quaffing partner. Sainsbury's also has an abundance of interesting bottles. Inycon Syrah 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99), from Sicily, is vibrant, saucy, sexy, with beautifully harnessed tannins allied to compressed fruit. It's a terrific fiver's-worth of Mediteranean-style syrah. Bellingham Merlot 1998 (16 points, \u00a35.99), from South Africa, has a curious, pear-drop undertone to rich, dry fruit that redefines merlot's mouthwatering deliciousness. Merlot Vin de Pays de la Cit\u00e9 de Carcassonne Caroline de Beaulieu 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a33.99) has a spicy, baked-fruit aroma leading to some stunning, herby, hedgerow-fruited richness. It has a refined rusticity of impact and good manners. Ch\u00e2teau Haut de la Pierri\u00e8re C\u00f4tes de Castillon 1998 (16 points, \u00a35.49) is a marvellous claret of substance and warmth, and parades gripping tannins with chocolate and cassis fruit. Alteza 750 Tempranillo (16 points, \u00a34.49), from Spain, raises a provocative question: why drink expensive Rioja when there is this compelling reason to spend so much less and get so much more? It has gorgeous fruit that stays firm and dry even as it strikes with such vivacity. Old Git Grenache Syrah 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a33.99) is a daffy name, but a highly drinkable red. I'm bound to be tickled by that name, edging as I am towards old gitness myself, and the dry, Midi fruit is rounded and gluggable. Last, Sainsbury's Bulgarian Merlot (15.5 points, \u00a32.99) is also massively drinkable, but suffers from presenting one of the world's naffer labels. The bottle contains purple fruit of style and wit, but many a drinker will trundle past and ignore it.",

      "body": "<p>The boy from Transylvania never slept at night. As soon as he got to Paris, he fell in love with its low-life, its high-life, its wet and empty streets. He became a noctambulist, walking the city after dark, wandering everywhere, from Montparnasse to Montmartre. Sometimes, he took a friend: he hung around the artists' cafes with Henry Miller, and went to dance-halls on the outskirts with the writer Raymond Queneau. But mostly, he went out by himself. He became, in Miller's phrase, \"the Eye of Paris\", always, Miller remembered, \"on the look-out, sniffing the air, rummaging around in every nook and cranny, his gaze always far away. Everything, literally everything, was of interest to him.\" He walked until he could smell fresh croissants in the cafes and feel the still-wet ink on the morning papers. Only then did he go to bed. </p> <p>Until that moment, he had been Gyula Hal\u00e1sz. In Paris, he was Brassa\u00ef, and although it would be years before he picked up a camera, he was to become one of the most influential photographers of the 20th century. Hal\u00e1sz arrived from Brasso (the town from which he took his name), then part of Hungary and now in Romania, in 1924. He had studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest, and at art school in Berlin. He wanted to be a painter, was confident of his talent, and had no interest in photography. He even said he felt contempt for the newer medium, and many years later was to regret having been unmoved when he met the great photographer Eugene Atget and saw his now famous work. </p> <p>He earned money by writing articles for German and Hungarian newspapers, and throughout his life he wrote with eloquence and ease. He painted the odd portrait and sketched caricatures, but it wasn't much of a living. He had to hire photographers to illustrate the articles he wrote - Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz was among them - and after a while he thought he'd do better financially if he took the pictures himself. But these practical concerns weren't the only things on his mind. He later spoke of his conversion to photography as if he'd been driven to it, despite himself. Really, it was his life as a nightwalker that made him want to - or need to - take up a camera. He felt he had to record his nocturnal visions in some immediate way, and from that moment Brassa\u00ef was a new man. Although he was born in Brasso in 1899, he later said that Paris, 1933, was when he had come to life, and his real date and place of birth no longer held any meaning. </p> <p>Centennial celebrations, however, have taken their cue from the date on his passport. The Pompidou Centre in Paris has organised a spectacular exhibition of his work, including drawings and sculptures, which will come to London in February next year. The exhibition kicks off with some of Brassa\u00ef's portraits of artists - Picasso, Matisse, Dali, Giacometti - as if to position him among more famous men, or to situate him in a particularly creative era. Although Brassa\u00ef published a wonderful book about his relationship with Picasso, he always wrote so well that it's hard to separate the truth from the myth. How friendly was he with that group? He claimed he was never a surrealist, except in that he aimed to give the everyday a \"fantastical\" slant, and yet he produced 150 photographs for their magazine, Minotaure. When reading his various books, letters and diary jottings, it's worth bearing in mind the fantastical slant he may have given many things. </p> <p>An anecdote from his first days in Paris offers an early warning. Desperate for money, Brassa\u00ef writes up an entirely fabricated interview with Count Kokotzoff, the former Russian prime minister. He submits it to the editorial office, which immediately syndicates it to 15 German newspapers. A week or so later, the editorial office asks for the Count's address. Brassa\u00ef panics. Not only has he never met the Count, but he doesn't actually know if he is still alive. Several Russian friends insist the Count is dead. Brassa\u00ef finds him, however, in hiding from the Bolsheviks, somewhere near the Champs Elys\u00e9es. He stakes out the Count's palace. He begs him not to refute the article. It is a tribute to Brassa\u00ef's charm that the Count agrees to ignore the article, and even writes Brassa\u00ef a letter expressing the high esteem in which he now holds him. </p> <p>It was a peculiar talent of his to fit in with every class of society. He became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of one Madame D-B, who gave him a studio and introduced him to the rich and famous. Meanwhile, as he wandered the streets, he found that strangers \"bared their souls\" to him. He was a listener and a chameleon, his friends all said; he could put himself at anyone's level, he always observed and never judged. At the end of 1929 he bought his first camera, and put these skills to a new use. He began to capture what he saw. Success was almost instant. </p> <p>What Brassa\u00ef saw, of course, was the Paris night. He had chosen photography, he later said, partly because it was \"a medium specific to our time\", but since it was also the medium of writing in light he had to make a new art form out of it by writing in darkness. In an article written in 1933, he explained how he made up his technique as he went along: how he waited four minutes or more for an exposure, how he avoided the immediate light of the lamp-posts, diffusing it behind trees or with distance, reflecting it in rainy streets, using only available light but excluding its source from the frame. It was important to him to capture that strange lighting, to seize the night as he knew it, full of unnerving shadows. His photos seem to be recording some crime, or searching for it. They are not crime scenes in the way that Weegee's are - flashgun shots of real police evidence; nor do they depict crimes in the metaphorical way Atget's were said to - portraying the sharp, unpeopled detail of a possible aftermath. </p> <p>Brassa\u00ef's photos have the furtive curiosity of the stalker. They look as if they are evoking crime in the way that the photographer in Antonioni's Blow-Up innocently did: the murder must be in there somewhere, you think as you look at them: is it by the canal, next to the jail, between the glistening rails of the Gare St Lazare, or in the crowded wings of the Folies Berg\u00e8re stage? \"The night works by suggestion,\" Brassa\u00ef said, \"it never fully reveals things.\" </p> <p>He was regularly commissioned by a penny magazine called D\u00e9tective. Many say it was just a job, like the articles he used to dash off for the papers, giving them titles such as Paris Dog Cemetery and How Sardines Lose Their Heads. But I think his work for D\u00e9tective says a good deal about Brassa\u00ef's imagination. He once photographed a narrative series, called A Man Dies In The Street, in which he recorded a growing and diminishing crowd around a corpse, and the paramedics who take it away. He gave other photographs titles that evoked D\u00e9tective's style of fiction. A group of gangsters climbing a wall is called \"Pour un roman policier\", which is translated in its English caption as \"For a detective story\", but rather than a commission it is more likely to mean \"towards a detective novel\": a tribute, or an offering, that might one day expand and add up to a thriller. In any case, in the work he did for that magazine, fact and fiction merged: on one occasion, a gangster came to his door and held a knife to his throat, not for having photographed him, but because the caption in the magazine had labelled him an \"assassin\". </p> <p>How avant-garde Brassa\u00ef was can be seen from the most random-seeming historical details. For example, he was arrested three times while working because, when he told the police he was taking photos, they thought this a poor excuse - everyone knew you couldn't take photos at night; he must have been dumping a body in the canal. Though innocent on those occasions, Brassa\u00ef was guilty on others: in the 30s, taking photographs in brothels was illegal. Brothels themselves weren't illegal, but they had to have their shutters closed. And since it was assumed that the shutters would have to be opened in order to let in the light for a photograph, this odd law was established: brothels were to remain enclosed, and unrecorded. Yet some of Brassa\u00ef's most famous images were taken in brothels, or \"houses of illusion\", as they were called. They are artful, knowing references to the paintings of Degas (whose favourite brothel Brassa\u00ef fondly mentions), but they are also hasty, tilted snapshots, taken in the heat of a ravaging moment or in the rush of undress. In one photograph, a woman in a black camisole, silk stockings and snakeskin heels is seen from behind, washing herself in a bidet. In the corner, a man is hunched over, tying his shoe, while his braces are still undone. They have pulled the curtain tightly shut, wrapping its edge around a bathroom pipe, so intense is their need for privacy. How, then, have they been photographed? Where is Brassa\u00ef? Can we really be seeing this? </p> <p>Famous as these photos now are, there is still something shocking about them: it's not their nudity, it's their very existence. They are like early fly-on-the-wall documentaries - impossible, intrusive, abrasive, riveting. Later on, it became known that the man in this photo, as in the ones of Suzy's brothel, in which the naked prostitute stands by a sink or is embraced while showing her pubis through her fringed skirt, was Brassa\u00ef's assistant. Oddly, though, this doesn't make the photographs any less voyeuristic, it just makes Brassa\u00ef more complicit. He is both an actor and a voyeur in a scene of his own construction - a revelation that has presented a problem to commentators on Brassa\u00ef's work. It is often said that his photographs have a documentary quality to them, but, as the exhibition curator Alain Sayag points out in his catalogue essay, Brassa\u00ef, on the contrary, set everything up very carefully. The punter was his assistant, and passers-by were his friends. So what was Brassa\u00ef doing? Some years later, when he had photographed Picasso's sculptures, the artist said his pictures were so \"truthful\" they were \"like a blood sample that allows you to analyse and diagnose what I was at those moments\". But on another day in Picasso's studio, as Brassa\u00ef was photographing his chair and slippers, Picasso stated that the photo would not be \"a document\", because Brassa\u00ef had moved his slippers. \"I never place them that way,\" he said. No one other than Picasso, however, would know that, and the question that arises then is why Brassa\u00ef chose to compose his scenes with this documentary aesthetic. </p> <p>\"I invent nothing, I imagine everything,\" Brassa\u00ef once said, explaining that what he depicted was never false, it was just part of the way he saw the world. With this in mind, his pictures become more admirable than mere documents, and more complicated than photographs that set out to be art (such as those of Man Ray, to whom Brassa\u00ef claimed to be \"diametrically opposed\"). Brassa\u00ef, a Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 in love with Paris and the varied spectacles of its night, found a way of filtering through a camera the images he had in his head. He did not just photograph what was there, he mixed what was there with his own, subjective, love-struck gaze. Late in life, Brassa\u00ef was asked why he had taken up photography, since he had held the medium in such low regard before. He replied that he needed an immediate way to record what he had seen in his \"nocturnal wanderings\". He had walked the streets of Paris for six years before he took a single photo and, he said, \"I could no longer hold the pictures in me.\" It is a wonderful phrase - as if Brassa\u00ef's mind were the camera, and the technical apparatus just a necessary way of developing the latent images. He himself wrote a similar thing about Marcel Proust, imagining him to have collected snapshots throughout his life, which he remembered later: \"Proust seemed to me to be a sort of photographer of mental images, with his own body as the sensitised plate.\" It seems logical, then - Brassa\u00ef's photographs cannot be documentary or, if they are, they're only records of the inside of his head. </p> <p>Although Brassa\u00ef photographed his fancy new friends as well - their balls and their dinners, their masks and their dresses - it was the seamy side of Paris he most actively sought out. \"Rightly or wrongly,\" he wrote, \"it seemed to me then that this underground world was the least cosmopolitan, most lively, most authentic side of Paris, and that in the colourful figures who inhabited its underside there survived, from era to era, almost without change, the folklore of its most distant past.\" He photographed working girls in the street, he roamed the carnivalesque world of the funfair. He met Conchita the stripper (\"that white negress\"), and the depressed Gorilla-man with his baby son. He had his wallet stolen when he was following the gangsters in Big Albert's Gang, and didn't mind - \"They got the loot, I got the pictures. It made sense. We each had a job to do.\" </p> <p>In each of these cases, Brassa\u00ef got to know his subjects. He spoke to them for so long and with such familiarity that eventually he added to his chameleon nature a facility for a kind of anthropological ventriloquism. He wrote about them, reporting, inimitably, their thoughts and their speech. He noted of the gangsters, for example, that they had \"20 expressions for love, about 30 for kissing, 10 for arousal, as many again for orgasm, more than 70 - a record! - for sex. 50 words describe the male organ, there are 15 for testicles, 20 or so for the female genitals, 20 for breasts, 20 for rear end.\" And he recorded that gangsters all gave themselves slang names that were words for fish (\"mackerel\", \"herring\"), while the police were named after birds (\"chickens\", \"partridges\" and, for cycling policemen, \"swallows\"). Hence, a gangster hide-out was an \"aquarium\", and prison was a \"chicken coop\". Brassa\u00ef even published a little book, The Story Of Marie, in which each page is a prose poem in the voice of a cleaning lady. He meant to add more, so that all of Paris could be heard to speak their mind aloud. </p> <p>In a sense, though, that is what his best photographs were. His aim, he said, was to make it look as though it had been the subjects' idea, not his, to take the photos. His pictures of brothels and bars, gangsters and sculptors all seem to be taken by one of them, as if the camera itself were a part of that world, snapping in artful and sympathetic surveillance. By all sorts of ruses, Brassa\u00ef managed to get into to secret places - dodgy dancehalls and high-class opium dens - places which, as he put it, \"refused to be witnessed\". It was not enough to photograph canals and streets, he wanted to be indoors, to see Paris from inside out. Often he would spot an apartment at the top of a building he liked the look of, and he would wake up its shocked inhabitants, just to photograph the view. He was hardly ever refused entry, but he remembered one bitter occasion in particular. He knocks on the door of a seventh-floor attic, and a man and woman answer. They don't look directly at him, they don't turn on the light, but they ask him what he wants. \"I'd like to see the view of Paris from your window,\" Brassa\u00ef tells them. \"Go ahead, sir,\" the man replies, \"have a look. We are not familiar with that view ourselves. We're both blind.\" Filled with shame, Brassa\u00ef runs away and never takes the picture. It was as if the Eye of Paris had come face to face with its own death. </p> <p>The photographs he took at night made Brassa\u00ef's name. By 1933, his first book, Paris After Dark, had come out, and even before that he was so in demand it was as if, he wrote to his parents, \"I were the only reporter in Paris\". There was the commission to photograph Picasso's sculptures. (In Conversations With Picasso, Brassa\u00ef mentions having broken one of his sculptures while trying to photograph it. Picasso joked about this: \"I told you so!\" he said to a group of friends as Brassa\u00ef spilled something. \"Brassa\u00ef breaks everything, knocks everything over, floods everything. Tomorrow he may start a fire here.\") He met Salvador Dal\u00ed when Dal\u00ed still had a small moustache, and did some work for him. He photographed the phallic Art Nouveau swirls of the Metro and, most memorably, an orgasmic girl on a bed. Dal\u00ed incorporated this picture into a collage of his own for Minotaure, entitled The Phenomenon Of Ecstasy, in which several ecstatic female faces are overheard by a series of male ears. It was undoubtedly a reference to the notorious, banned film of the previous year, Extase, which made the future Hedy Lamarr famous. Critics have said that since the photo was Dal\u00ed's idea, Brassa\u00ef's credit is lessened, but Brassa\u00ef's remains the iconic image. Seen on its own, the photograph has a different charm - grubby and sensual, an elongated body and bare, scrunched shoulder leading to a half-open mouth. In another print, he enlarged the woman's face; it becomes a different image again: this time, the features of her face are the almost abstract subject - the slits of her closed eyes, the arched lines of her brows, the even squares of her teeth. And a small detail suddenly springs to attention: a hole in the bedcover is the same shape as her mouth, open as if ripples of ecstasy had been emitted all around her. </p> <p>As a result of his surrealist connections, Brassa\u00ef did a series of portraits of artists in their studios - Maillol, Matisse, Dal\u00ed, Giacometti were all delighted with their photographs - which later became a book. But soon, perhaps as a result of his contact with these people, perhaps out of nostalgia or instinct, he began to yearn to return to \"the plastic arts\". He showed Picasso some of his drawings, and Picasso was so impressed he didn't understand why Brassa\u00ef had chosen to specialise in photography. \"You're a born draughtsman,\" he told him. \"Why don't you go on with it? You have a gold mine and you're working a salt mine.\" Brassa\u00ef defended his choice, saying that he didn't consider photography as \"a second profession\". But the truth was more complicated. He had been disillusioned with photography for some time. </p> <p>At the end of 1937 he wrote to his parents in Brasso: \"Photography is no longer a labour of love for me and I'm going to give it up as soon as possible.\" The battle to free himself from photography, as he put it, was ongoing. \"Sometimes,\" he wrote in retrospect, \"I was close to despair.\" Brassa\u00ef left Paris in 1940, along with some other friends, including Pr\u00e9vert. But he soon became anxious about his negatives, and returned. He wrote home asking for his mother's birth certificate, adding ominously, \"it is sufficient to prove that two of one's grandparents are Aryan\". But his war was, apparently, relatively uneventful. He spent time with Picasso in his studio, went back to drawing, and after the war married Gilberte Mercedes-Boyer, who had shared none of his pre-war life. He became a naturalised Frenchman, he made several small sculptures and wrote a great deal, publishing books on Henry Miller and Proust. He also accepted regular photographic assignments for Harper's Bazaar. But the fact was that after the war nothing was really the same. His photographs became more anecdotal, less timeless; destined, a cynic might say, for the picture postcard. </p> <p>Brassa\u00ef had a number of projects he had been working on - a book called Intimate Paris, for example, commissioned by a newspaper proprietor who also owned a brothel and a condom factory; a book of his narrative series, such as A Man Dies In The Street and The Balloon Seller; a book of nudes, a book of cacti. But it wasn't until 1976 that his second book of night photographs was published, under the title The Secret Paris Of The 1930s. Here, he had the chance to look back, to reflect on his nocturnal wanderings and, more strikingly, to discover that much of what he had captured had already disappeared: the tram-rail polishers, the cesspit pumpers, the market workers, the rag-pickers, the tramps. Several times he makes statements of almost pitiful nostalgia: there should be museums for pavements, for example, or reservations for homeless people like those the Americans made for their Indians. This kind of comment seems so silly it is unintelligible, except as the unformulated realisation that his world was gone. The only things left were the photographs. He died in 1984, aged 84. Perhaps his pictures were always meant to be left as records for posterity. When Paris After Dark came out in 1933, one of the reviews contained a strangely prescient remark. \"Photographers of 1933,\" it read, \"you are working for the year 2000: only then will your talent be recognised.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Brassa\u00ef: No Ordinary Eyes, is published by Thames &amp; Hudson at \u00a348.</p>",

The exhibition kicks off with some of Brassa\u00ef's portraits of artists - Picasso, Matisse, Dali, Giacometti - as if to position him among more famous men, or to situate him in a particularly creative era. Although Brassa\u00ef published a wonderful book about his relationship with Picasso, he always wrote so well that it's hard to separate the truth from the myth. How friendly was he with that group? He claimed he was never a surrealist, except in that he aimed to give the everyday a \"fantastical\" slant, and yet he produced 150 photographs for their magazine, Minotaure. When reading his various books, letters and diary jottings, it's worth bearing in mind the fantastical slant he may have given many things. An anecdote from his first days in Paris offers an early warning. Desperate for money, Brassa\u00ef writes up an entirely fabricated interview with Count Kokotzoff, the former Russian prime minister. He submits it to the editorial office, which immediately syndicates it to 15 German newspapers. A week or so later, the editorial office asks for the Count's address. Brassa\u00ef panics. Not only has he never met the Count, but he doesn't actually know if he is still alive. Several Russian friends insist the Count is dead. Brassa\u00ef finds him, however, in hiding from the Bolsheviks, somewhere near the Champs Elys\u00e9es. He stakes out the Count's palace. He begs him not to refute the article. It is a tribute to Brassa\u00ef's charm that the Count agrees to ignore the article, and even writes Brassa\u00ef a letter expressing the high esteem in which he now holds him. It was a peculiar talent of his to fit in with every class of society. He became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of one Madame D-B, who gave him a studio and introduced him to the rich and famous. Meanwhile, as he wandered the streets, he found that strangers \"bared their souls\" to him. He was a listener and a chameleon, his friends all said; he could put himself at anyone's level, he always observed and never judged. At the end of 1929 he bought his first camera, and put these skills to a new use. He began to capture what he saw. Success was almost instant. What Brassa\u00ef saw, of course, was the Paris night. He had chosen photography, he later said, partly because it was \"a medium specific to our time\", but since it was also the medium of writing in light he had to make a new art form out of it by writing in darkness. In an article written in 1933, he explained how he made up his technique as he went along: how he waited four minutes or more for an exposure, how he avoided the immediate light of the lamp-posts, diffusing it behind trees or with distance, reflecting it in rainy streets, using only available light but excluding its source from the frame. It was important to him to capture that strange lighting, to seize the night as he knew it, full of unnerving shadows. His photos seem to be recording some crime, or searching for it. They are not crime scenes in the way that Weegee's are - flashgun shots of real police evidence; nor do they depict crimes in the metaphorical way Atget's were said to - portraying the sharp, unpeopled detail of a possible aftermath. Brassa\u00ef's photos have the furtive curiosity of the stalker. They look as if they are evoking crime in the way that the photographer in Antonioni's Blow-Up innocently did: the murder must be in there somewhere, you think as you look at them: is it by the canal, next to the jail, between the glistening rails of the Gare St Lazare, or in the crowded wings of the Folies Berg\u00e8re stage? \"The night works by suggestion,\" Brassa\u00ef said, \"it never fully reveals things.\" He was regularly commissioned by a penny magazine called D\u00e9tective. Many say it was just a job, like the articles he used to dash off for the papers, giving them titles such as Paris Dog Cemetery and How Sardines Lose Their Heads. But I think his work for D\u00e9tective says a good deal about Brassa\u00ef's imagination. He once photographed a narrative series, called A Man Dies In The Street, in which he recorded a growing and diminishing crowd around a corpse, and the paramedics who take it away. He gave other photographs titles that evoked D\u00e9tective's style of fiction. A group of gangsters climbing a wall is called \"Pour un roman policier\", which is translated in its English caption as \"For a detective story\", but rather than a commission it is more likely to mean \"towards a detective novel\": a tribute, or an offering, that might one day expand and add up to a thriller. In any case, in the work he did for that magazine, fact and fiction merged: on one occasion, a gangster came to his door and held a knife to his throat, not for having photographed him, but because the caption in the magazine had labelled him an \"assassin\". How avant-garde Brassa\u00ef was can be seen from the most random-seeming historical details. For example, he was arrested three times while working because, when he told the police he was taking photos, they thought this a poor excuse - everyone knew you couldn't take photos at night; he must have been dumping a body in the canal. Though innocent on those occasions, Brassa\u00ef was guilty on others: in the 30s, taking photographs in brothels was illegal. Brothels themselves weren't illegal, but they had to have their shutters closed. And since it was assumed that the shutters would have to be opened in order to let in the light for a photograph, this odd law was established: brothels were to remain enclosed, and unrecorded. Yet some of Brassa\u00ef's most famous images were taken in brothels, or \"houses of illusion\", as they were called. They are artful, knowing references to the paintings of Degas (whose favourite brothel Brassa\u00ef fondly mentions), but they are also hasty, tilted snapshots, taken in the heat of a ravaging moment or in the rush of undress. In one photograph, a woman in a black camisole, silk stockings and snakeskin heels is seen from behind, washing herself in a bidet. In the corner, a man is hunched over, tying his shoe, while his braces are still undone. They have pulled the curtain tightly shut, wrapping its edge around a bathroom pipe, so intense is their need for privacy. How, then, have they been photographed? Where is Brassa\u00ef? Can we really be seeing this? Famous as these photos now are, there is still something shocking about them: it's not their nudity, it's their very existence. They are like early fly-on-the-wall documentaries - impossible, intrusive, abrasive, riveting. Later on, it became known that the man in this photo, as in the ones of Suzy's brothel, in which the naked prostitute stands by a sink or is embraced while showing her pubis through her fringed skirt, was Brassa\u00ef's assistant. Oddly, though, this doesn't make the photographs any less voyeuristic, it just makes Brassa\u00ef more complicit. He is both an actor and a voyeur in a scene of his own construction - a revelation that has presented a problem to commentators on Brassa\u00ef's work. It is often said that his photographs have a documentary quality to them, but, as the exhibition curator Alain Sayag points out in his catalogue essay, Brassa\u00ef, on the contrary, set everything up very carefully. The punter was his assistant, and passers-by were his friends. So what was Brassa\u00ef doing? Some years later, when he had photographed Picasso's sculptures, the artist said his pictures were so \"truthful\" they were \"like a blood sample that allows you to analyse and diagnose what I was at those moments\". But on another day in Picasso's studio, as Brassa\u00ef was photographing his chair and slippers, Picasso stated that the photo would not be \"a document\", because Brassa\u00ef had moved his slippers. \"I never place them that way,\" he said. No one other than Picasso, however, would know that, and the question that arises then is why Brassa\u00ef chose to compose his scenes with this documentary aesthetic. \"I invent nothing, I imagine everything,\" Brassa\u00ef once said, explaining that what he depicted was never false, it was just part of the way he saw the world. With this in mind, his pictures become more admirable than mere documents, and more complicated than photographs that set out to be art (such as those of Man Ray, to whom Brassa\u00ef claimed to be \"diametrically opposed\"). Brassa\u00ef, a Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 in love with Paris and the varied spectacles of its night, found a way of filtering through a camera the images he had in his head. He did not just photograph what was there, he mixed what was there with his own, subjective, love-struck gaze. Late in life, Brassa\u00ef was asked why he had taken up photography, since he had held the medium in such low regard before. He replied that he needed an immediate way to record what he had seen in his \"nocturnal wanderings\". He had walked the streets of Paris for six years before he took a single photo and, he said, \"I could no longer hold the pictures in me.\" It is a wonderful phrase - as if Brassa\u00ef's mind were the camera, and the technical apparatus just a necessary way of developing the latent images. He himself wrote a similar thing about Marcel Proust, imagining him to have collected snapshots throughout his life, which he remembered later: \"Proust seemed to me to be a sort of photographer of mental images, with his own body as the sensitised plate.\" It seems logical, then - Brassa\u00ef's photographs cannot be documentary or, if they are, they're only records of the inside of his head. Although Brassa\u00ef photographed his fancy new friends as well - their balls and their dinners, their masks and their dresses - it was the seamy side of Paris he most actively sought out. \"Rightly or wrongly,\" he wrote, \"it seemed to me then that this underground world was the least cosmopolitan, most lively, most authentic side of Paris, and that in the colourful figures who inhabited its underside there survived, from era to era, almost without change, the folklore of its most distant past.\" He photographed working girls in the street, he roamed the carnivalesque world of the funfair. He met Conchita the stripper (\"that white negress\"), and the depressed Gorilla-man with his baby son. He had his wallet stolen when he was following the gangsters in Big Albert's Gang, and didn't mind - \"They got the loot, I got the pictures. It made sense. We each had a job to do.\" In each of these cases, Brassa\u00ef got to know his subjects. He spoke to them for so long and with such familiarity that eventually he added to his chameleon nature a facility for a kind of anthropological ventriloquism. He wrote about them, reporting, inimitably, their thoughts and their speech. He noted of the gangsters, for example, that they had \"20 expressions for love, about 30 for kissing, 10 for arousal, as many again for orgasm, more than 70 - a record! - for sex. 50 words describe the male organ, there are 15 for testicles, 20 or so for the female genitals, 20 for breasts, 20 for rear end.\" And he recorded that gangsters all gave themselves slang names that were words for fish (\"mackerel\", \"herring\"), while the police were named after birds (\"chickens\", \"partridges\" and, for cycling policemen, \"swallows\"). Hence, a gangster hide-out was an \"aquarium\", and prison was a \"chicken coop\". Brassa\u00ef even published a little book, The Story Of Marie, in which each page is a prose poem in the voice of a cleaning lady. He meant to add more, so that all of Paris could be heard to speak their mind aloud. In a sense, though, that is what his best photographs were. His aim, he said, was to make it look as though it had been the subjects' idea, not his, to take the photos. His pictures of brothels and bars, gangsters and sculptors all seem to be taken by one of them, as if the camera itself were a part of that world, snapping in artful and sympathetic surveillance. By all sorts of ruses, Brassa\u00ef managed to get into to secret places - dodgy dancehalls and high-class opium dens - places which, as he put it, \"refused to be witnessed\". It was not enough to photograph canals and streets, he wanted to be indoors, to see Paris from inside out. Often he would spot an apartment at the top of a building he liked the look of, and he would wake up its shocked inhabitants, just to photograph the view. He was hardly ever refused entry, but he remembered one bitter occasion in particular. He knocks on the door of a seventh-floor attic, and a man and woman answer. They don't look directly at him, they don't turn on the light, but they ask him what he wants. \"I'd like to see the view of Paris from your window,\" Brassa\u00ef tells them. \"Go ahead, sir,\" the man replies, \"have a look. We are not familiar with that view ourselves. We're both blind.\" Filled with shame, Brassa\u00ef runs away and never takes the picture. It was as if the Eye of Paris had come face to face with its own death. The photographs he took at night made Brassa\u00ef's name. By 1933, his first book, Paris After Dark, had come out, and even before that he was so in demand it was as if, he wrote to his parents, \"I were the only reporter in Paris\". There was the commission to photograph Picasso's sculptures. (In Conversations With Picasso, Brassa\u00ef mentions having broken one of his sculptures while trying to photograph it. Picasso joked about this: \"I told you so!\" he said to a group of friends as Brassa\u00ef spilled something. \"Brassa\u00ef breaks everything, knocks everything over, floods everything. Tomorrow he may start a fire here.\") He met Salvador Dal\u00ed when Dal\u00ed still had a small moustache, and did some work for him. He photographed the phallic Art Nouveau swirls of the Metro and, most memorably, an orgasmic girl on a bed. Dal\u00ed incorporated this picture into a collage of his own for Minotaure, entitled The Phenomenon Of Ecstasy, in which several ecstatic female faces are overheard by a series of male ears. It was undoubtedly a reference to the notorious, banned film of the previous year, Extase, which made the future Hedy Lamarr famous. Critics have said that since the photo was Dal\u00ed's idea, Brassa\u00ef's credit is lessened, but Brassa\u00ef's remains the iconic image. Seen on its own, the photograph has a different charm - grubby and sensual, an elongated body and bare, scrunched shoulder leading to a half-open mouth. In another print, he enlarged the woman's face; it becomes a different image again: this time, the features of her face are the almost abstract subject - the slits of her closed eyes, the arched lines of her brows, the even squares of her teeth. And a small detail suddenly springs to attention: a hole in the bedcover is the same shape as her mouth, open as if ripples of ecstasy had been emitted all around her. As a result of his surrealist connections, Brassa\u00ef did a series of portraits of artists in their studios - Maillol, Matisse, Dal\u00ed, Giacometti were all delighted with their photographs - which later became a book. But soon, perhaps as a result of his contact with these people, perhaps out of nostalgia or instinct, he began to yearn to return to \"the plastic arts\". He showed Picasso some of his drawings, and Picasso was so impressed he didn't understand why Brassa\u00ef had chosen to specialise in photography. \"You're a born draughtsman,\" he told him. \"Why don't you go on with it? You have a gold mine and you're working a salt mine.\" Brassa\u00ef defended his choice, saying that he didn't consider photography as \"a second profession\". But the truth was more complicated. He had been disillusioned with photography for some time. At the end of 1937 he wrote to his parents in Brasso: \"Photography is no longer a labour of love for me and I'm going to give it up as soon as possible.\" The battle to free himself from photography, as he put it, was ongoing. \"Sometimes,\" he wrote in retrospect, \"I was close to despair.\" Brassa\u00ef left Paris in 1940, along with some other friends, including Pr\u00e9vert. But he soon became anxious about his negatives, and returned. He wrote home asking for his mother's birth certificate, adding ominously, \"it is sufficient to prove that two of one's grandparents are Aryan\". But his war was, apparently, relatively uneventful. He spent time with Picasso in his studio, went back to drawing, and after the war married Gilberte Mercedes-Boyer, who had shared none of his pre-war life. He became a naturalised Frenchman, he made several small sculptures and wrote a great deal, publishing books on Henry Miller and Proust. He also accepted regular photographic assignments for Harper's Bazaar. But the fact was that after the war nothing was really the same. His photographs became more anecdotal, less timeless; destined, a cynic might say, for the picture postcard. Brassa\u00ef had a number of projects he had been working on - a book called Intimate Paris, for example, commissioned by a newspaper proprietor who also owned a brothel and a condom factory; a book of his narrative series, such as A Man Dies In The Street and The Balloon Seller; a book of nudes, a book of cacti. But it wasn't until 1976 that his second book of night photographs was published, under the title The Secret Paris Of The 1930s. Here, he had the chance to look back, to reflect on his nocturnal wanderings and, more strikingly, to discover that much of what he had captured had already disappeared: the tram-rail polishers, the cesspit pumpers, the market workers, the rag-pickers, the tramps. Several times he makes statements of almost pitiful nostalgia: there should be museums for pavements, for example, or reservations for homeless people like those the Americans made for their Indians. This kind of comment seems so silly it is unintelligible, except as the unformulated realisation that his world was gone. The only things left were the photographs. He died in 1984, aged 84. Perhaps his pictures were always meant to be left as records for posterity. When Paris After Dark came out in 1933, one of the reviews contained a strangely prescient remark. \"Photographers of 1933,\" it read, \"you are working for the year 2000: only then will your talent be recognised.\" \u0095 Brassa\u00ef: No Ordinary Eyes, is published by Thames &amp; Hudson at \u00a348.",

      "body": "<p>Once, in the late 80s, I came across the representative of an organisation called the Campaign for Quality Television. It was at the Edinburgh Television Festival. He wore a buttoned-up blue blazer, a pink shirt with a white collar and an air of self-righteousness. I thought it was a strange idea for a campaign. I suppose what the founders meant was the Campaign for Good Television, but feared that might sound too much like television which the maximum number of people would enjoy, which is not what they meant. Perhaps a more precise name would have been the Campaign for Television for Ladies and Gentlemen of Quality. </p> <p>A campaign for less bias in television, for less censorship, for more local channels, these I could understand. But a campaign for good TV implies that TV is something you cannot do without, that there is no alternative to TV, that bad TV is like bad air or foul water, a health scandal. Perhaps the logic of the campaign's founders was: people cannot be weaned off television, it is compulsive, addictive and dominant, so it is essential that what people watch is of high quality, otherwise their brains will soften. On this basis, of course, there should also be a Campaign for Quality Heroin. </p> <p>If, on the other hand, you take the view that television is just another medium, competing with the printed word, cinema, recorded speech and music, video, DVD and the internet, then there is no problem to campaign against, apart from the licence fee. In the mid-70s, rock and roll was vile, bland and bloated, but no one thought of launching a Campaign for Quality Rock Music. Someone did launch punk, though. </p> <p>Shortly after my encounter with the campaign, I left the country, staying abroad for most of the 90s. As I prepared to return, I began to fret about those campaigners. What if, against all the odds, they had succeeded? What if all four terrestrial channels - five, even, for there was rumoured to be a new fifth channel up and running in Britain - just oozed quality from morning till the small hours? If, instead of masterpieces like I, Claudius or Twin Peaks or Pennies From Heaven being rare moments of brilliance in dull schedules, TV was great all the time? It was a terrifying thought. No one would read books any more. Libraries would close, as would theatres and cinemas, perhaps even restaurants. The internet would fail. As a reporter for a print/website newspaper, who tried to make time to write books and loved to read them, my livelihood would be at stake. It might be necessary to launch a Campaign for Bad Television. </p> <p>There was another fear. At the time I left, public and political opinion had seemed to be moving solidly towards support for reform of the licensing laws. No more last orders, no more desperate binge drinking, no more hurrying home long before midnight. A Continental ease would smooth out the wrinkles of our tense drinking times. We too would be meeting up with friends at 11 pm, and three hours later still sipping wine in a cafe in the Hackney arrondissement amid the laughing, scooter-busy bustle of the night. </p> <p>What hope would there be for reading or writing in this brave new world of quality television and Catalonian cafe hedonism? Proust would be pissed away over interminable brandies in the glamorous all-night bars of Clapton, Kafka dissolved in hours spent riveted to a small screen. </p> <p>How proud I was of Britain, how ashamed of my doubts, when I returned to find that the lords of television, and the government, had risen to meet these twin challenges to literacy and culture. After all, making bad television is not as easy as it seems. It is not enough to be offensive, or cheap. These attributes can be seductive. Back in the 80s, there used to be an abysmal nighttime show called The Hitman and Her, in which Michaela Strachan and Pete Waterman would stand in a heaving nightclub in real time, surrounded by sweating bodies, mouthing inanities and occasionally interviewing the punters, yelling over the sound of the music : \"So what do you like to do?\" \"Dancing and sex\".</p> <p> Could there have been anything less like quality? And yet in an after-pub state, it was dangerously easy to slump in front of. There was a compelling, voyeuristic quality to it - it was real. To be truly bad, to force the viewer to switch off and get up from the sofa, there must be a rare combination of money being thrown about, active contempt for the viewer's intelligence, false performances and terrible writing. It was when I saw the first five minutes of an episode of Babes in the Wood that I realised with what panache television had spurned the temptation to be good. Apart from the occasional renegade flash of inspiration, like Have I Got News For You, or the occasional import, like Seinfeld, Britain was safe for literature, music, cinema, theatre and non-TV current affairs. </p> <p>As for the drinking - on reflection, it showed great lack of faith to think Britain was in any danger of acquiring an all-night cafe culture. It still seems peculiar to sit in the middle of Soho at 10.30 on a Sunday night, in the largest city in Europe, one which lays claim to be a centre of fashion and progressive lifestyles, only to watch the streets drain of people, the lights go out and the publicans bang the chair seats down on the table-tops. How courageous of the government to resist licensing law reform. Cynics might argue that it has nothing to do with the government, that the big companies have no wish to change the present arrangement, which allows them to sell huge quantities of booze to bingers without having to go to the massive extra expense of paying staff to work through the night, but we are not all cynics. I am sure the government's idea is that we all have time to read or write a little before we go to bed. </p> <p>Not long ago a friend expounded to me on the recently-minted concept of \"time bankruptcy\". He himself was time bankrupt, he admitted. You are time bankrupt when the amount of things you have acquired which you have to process - mainly books and opera recordings, in his case - cannot possibly be read or listened to in the time you have left to live. Our lives are dominated by big choices between personal independence and family, but underlying that are the little daily choices of time, between TV time and reading time, between drinking time and creative time, which add up to another mighty choice. We know we should be more discriminating, but we are so weak, and the convivial warmth of the pub is so inviting, the lure of the moving pictures in the little box so fascinating. </p> <p> Over the top of my computer screen as I try to concentrate on writing this, I can see a TV set in the distance, with the sound turned down. A low budget quiz show is on. Three possible answers flick up on the screen - A, Chernobyl; B, London's unlicensed hot dog stands; C, Wales. The contestants shift uneasily behind their lecterns. My mind begins to race. What question could possibly be tied to all three answers? For whole minutes, I'm drawn into a silent, non-quality TV broadcast. How much more dangerous if I could hear them and they were saying something interesting. No wonder, in the days before cable, digital and satellite, we used to repeat to each other that unknowing version of the terrible food/ small portions joke: \"TV's terrible this week.\" \"I know. And so few channels!\" </p> <p>Earlier this year, the government published a white paper declaring that in 2001, no ifs or buts, 24-hour drinking was on. We'll see whether it happens, and how many licensees actually take them up on it. But if, in future, we really are going to be able to spin out a bottle of claret in the bar between 11pm and 4am, all that stands between us and cultural collapse - as has long been the case in continental Europe - is rigid adherence to the principles of bad television. Rupert Murdoch is not low quality enough. One of his companies, after all, produced The Simpsons. </p> <p>We need English Berlusconis, and perhaps European quotas protecting us from the best US television (often the best TV in Britain), to drive quality down to the point where people are hammering on the doors of public libraries, demanding to be allowed to borrow more books; to the point where I can sit down and actually listen to my CD of Billy Budd from beginning to end. </p> <p>Campaigning for quality television is like lying in front of the fire, calling for someone to drag you away because you're too hot. The government's job is to teach people to read, write and use the tools of new technology, and to judiciously subsidise artistic endeavour. Governments do not have the power to create or destroy culture. That's the public's business, and to suggest governments or prime ministers have control of some kind of cultural joystick with which they can steer the country towards a particular cultural compass point, as Doris Lessing and VS Naipul did last week, is to misrepresent culture as a top-down thing. We do not live in a totalitarian state, so governments are not the arbiters of culture; television is not the only medium of art, entertainment and information, so we can switch it off, if we have the strength. And the worse it is, the easier. </p> <p>I watch TV. I like it. Television has been a part of my life, and will remain so, until the last edition of Channel Four News is replaced with a celebrity house makeover show, the celebrities in question having had non-speaking jury member roles in Ally McBeal. But I could do without it. It is a great eater of time, and I fear it might have eaten too much already. Perhaps there is one small, legislative change the Campaign for Quality Television could campaign for. They could change their name to the Campaign for Quality Television or No Television, and argue that on all remotes, the off button should be four times the size, illuminated, and right in the middle.</p>",

No one would read books any more. Libraries would close, as would theatres and cinemas, perhaps even restaurants. The internet would fail. As a reporter for a print/website newspaper, who tried to make time to write books and loved to read them, my livelihood would be at stake. It might be necessary to launch a Campaign for Bad Television. There was another fear. At the time I left, public and political opinion had seemed to be moving solidly towards support for reform of the licensing laws. No more last orders, no more desperate binge drinking, no more hurrying home long before midnight. A Continental ease would smooth out the wrinkles of our tense drinking times. We too would be meeting up with friends at 11 pm, and three hours later still sipping wine in a cafe in the Hackney arrondissement amid the laughing, scooter-busy bustle of the night. What hope would there be for reading or writing in this brave new world of quality television and Catalonian cafe hedonism? Proust would be pissed away over interminable brandies in the glamorous all-night bars of Clapton, Kafka dissolved in hours spent riveted to a small screen. How proud I was of Britain, how ashamed of my doubts, when I returned to find that the lords of television, and the government, had risen to meet these twin challenges to literacy and culture. After all, making bad television is not as easy as it seems. It is not enough to be offensive, or cheap. These attributes can be seductive. Back in the 80s, there used to be an abysmal nighttime show called The Hitman and Her, in which Michaela Strachan and Pete Waterman would stand in a heaving nightclub in real time, surrounded by sweating bodies, mouthing inanities and occasionally interviewing the punters, yelling over the sound of the music : \"So what do you like to do?\" \"Dancing and sex\". Could there have been anything less like quality? And yet in an after-pub state, it was dangerously easy to slump in front of. There was a compelling, voyeuristic quality to it - it was real. To be truly bad, to force the viewer to switch off and get up from the sofa, there must be a rare combination of money being thrown about, active contempt for the viewer's intelligence, false performances and terrible writing. It was when I saw the first five minutes of an episode of Babes in the Wood that I realised with what panache television had spurned the temptation to be good. Apart from the occasional renegade flash of inspiration, like Have I Got News For You, or the occasional import, like Seinfeld, Britain was safe for literature, music, cinema, theatre and non-TV current affairs. As for the drinking - on reflection, it showed great lack of faith to think Britain was in any danger of acquiring an all-night cafe culture. It still seems peculiar to sit in the middle of Soho at 10.30 on a Sunday night, in the largest city in Europe, one which lays claim to be a centre of fashion and progressive lifestyles, only to watch the streets drain of people, the lights go out and the publicans bang the chair seats down on the table-tops. How courageous of the government to resist licensing law reform. Cynics might argue that it has nothing to do with the government, that the big companies have no wish to change the present arrangement, which allows them to sell huge quantities of booze to bingers without having to go to the massive extra expense of paying staff to work through the night, but we are not all cynics. I am sure the government's idea is that we all have time to read or write a little before we go to bed. Not long ago a friend expounded to me on the recently-minted concept of \"time bankruptcy\". He himself was time bankrupt, he admitted. You are time bankrupt when the amount of things you have acquired which you have to process - mainly books and opera recordings, in his case - cannot possibly be read or listened to in the time you have left to live. Our lives are dominated by big choices between personal independence and family, but underlying that are the little daily choices of time, between TV time and reading time, between drinking time and creative time, which add up to another mighty choice. We know we should be more discriminating, but we are so weak, and the convivial warmth of the pub is so inviting, the lure of the moving pictures in the little box so fascinating. Over the top of my computer screen as I try to concentrate on writing this, I can see a TV set in the distance, with the sound turned down. A low budget quiz show is on. Three possible answers flick up on the screen - A, Chernobyl; B, London's unlicensed hot dog stands; C, Wales. The contestants shift uneasily behind their lecterns. My mind begins to race. What question could possibly be tied to all three answers? For whole minutes, I'm drawn into a silent, non-quality TV broadcast. How much more dangerous if I could hear them and they were saying something interesting. No wonder, in the days before cable, digital and satellite, we used to repeat to each other that unknowing version of the terrible food/ small portions joke: \"TV's terrible this week.\" \"I know. And so few channels!\" Earlier this year, the government published a white paper declaring that in 2001, no ifs or buts, 24-hour drinking was on. We'll see whether it happens, and how many licensees actually take them up on it. But if, in future, we really are going to be able to spin out a bottle of claret in the bar between 11pm and 4am, all that stands between us and cultural collapse - as has long been the case in continental Europe - is rigid adherence to the principles of bad television. Rupert Murdoch is not low quality enough. One of his companies, after all, produced The Simpsons. We need English Berlusconis, and perhaps European quotas protecting us from the best US television (often the best TV in Britain), to drive quality down to the point where people are hammering on the doors of public libraries, demanding to be allowed to borrow more books; to the point where I can sit down and actually listen to my CD of Billy Budd from beginning to end. Campaigning for quality television is like lying in front of the fire, calling for someone to drag you away because you're too hot. The government's job is to teach people to read, write and use the tools of new technology, and to judiciously subsidise artistic endeavour. Governments do not have the power to create or destroy culture. That's the public's business, and to suggest governments or prime ministers have control of some kind of cultural joystick with which they can steer the country towards a particular cultural compass point, as Doris Lessing and VS Naipul did last week, is to misrepresent culture as a top-down thing. We do not live in a totalitarian state, so governments are not the arbiters of culture; television is not the only medium of art, entertainment and information, so we can switch it off, if we have the strength. And the worse it is, the easier. I watch TV. I like it. Television has been a part of my life, and will remain so, until the last edition of Channel Four News is replaced with a celebrity house makeover show, the celebrities in question having had non-speaking jury member roles in Ally McBeal. But I could do without it. It is a great eater of time, and I fear it might have eaten too much already. Perhaps there is one small, legislative change the Campaign for Quality Television could campaign for. They could change their name to the Campaign for Quality Television or No Television, and argue that on all remotes, the off button should be four times the size, illuminated, and right in the middle.",

This cloned card is then used to buy goods until the real cardholder gets a statement showing that they've been leading a double life. So in an attempt to block off this path, credit companies such as Barclaycard are putting silicon chips into cards that are much more difficult for counterfeiters to copy than magnetic strips. But for consumers who still feel jittery about online shopping, the best security isn't a piece of gadgetry but the more practical offer of purchase protection, available from most major credit cards. If goods bought online fail to arrive or are broken, the credit card will cover losses. The Office for Fair Trading recommends that online shoppers should always use credit cards because of the protection they offer. Finally, I don't want to stoke anyone's paranoia, but one e-commerce security risk that so far I've not had explained is what happens if your whole computer gets stolen. If you use a laptop for e-shopping (or online banking) will your card and banking details still be retrievable from the computer's memory? If your laptop has become an electronic wallet, should you cancel your cards when it's stolen? Answers on a virtual postcard. Email: coughlan-sean@hotmail.com",

      "body": "<p>Pop into a branch of Going Places and one week's travel insurance will set you back \u00a339.99. But pop on to the internet and you can find similar cover for under a tenner. </p> <p>Unfortunately, you have to know where to go in cyberspace, and it took me an hour before I found the best quote, from online broker <a href=\"http://www.screentrade.co.uk\">www.screentrade.co.uk</a>. I started by typing in \"travel insurance\" at www.yahoo.co.uk, which instantly came up with 281 sites offering cover, plus its own insurance centre. The list of sites was not encouraging; none of the names were instantly recognisable, many were duplicate sites, and some seemed to have travel insurance added as an afterthought following a long list of other insurances. </p> <p>A surprising number of US-based sites featured, which is largely useless for UK-based travellers looking to arrange insurance for a week in the Med this summer. Many are also no more than pages of information with a telephone number at the bottom. As most net users expect to be able to make an instant transaction online, the idea of having to go through a call centre as well seems to defeat the object. </p> <p>For example, Yahoo lists PHA (<a href=\"http://www.demon.co.uk/dayco/phatrav.html\">www.demon.co.uk/dayco/phatrav.html</a>), which asked me to fill in a detailed form. But rather than giving an instant quote, it said I would be contacted by telephone or email. Two hours later, I was still waiting. Instead I tried Yahoo's own insurance centre, operated by <a href=\"http://www.insure.co.uk\">www.insure.co.uk</a>. Again there was a lengthy form, but at least this time I obtained a quote. For a single person on a one-week holiday in Spain in August, it gave me three quotes: \u00a313.58 via a Lloyd's syndicate, \u00a315.80 with CGU and \u00a316.40 from Axa. </p> <p>I also asked for quotes for an individual annual insurance policy. The same three insurers came up, this time with quotes of \u00a339, \u00a349 and \u00a360 respectively. All would allow me to buy online. </p> <p>These quotes were certainly a lot better than the high street (and Going Places doesn't even sell an annual policy) but they turned out not to be the best. </p> <p>My next move was to access one of my favourite financial sites, <a href=\"http://www.find.co.uk\">www.find.co.uk</a>, which acts as a portal for a huge range of financial products. Its travel insurance centre lists 67 UK travel insurers, with a quick description so that you know if you're going to a broker or a direct seller. </p> <p>Sitting near the top is AA Insurance Services (<a href=\"http://www.theaa.co.uk\">www.theaa.co.uk</a>). It had one of the most simple and user-friendly sites, but its quotes failed to live up to expectations. It offered me one-week cover at \u00a321.08 and an annual policy at \u00a389.85. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.columbusdirect.co.uk\">www.columbusdirect.co.uk</a>, probably the best-known cheap travel insurer, was another easy-to-use site and it offered lower quotes than the AA. It would cover me for a week for \u00a317 and \u00a359 for an annual policy - although it was still not the best. Unfortunately another cheapie, <a href=\"http://www.journeywise.co.uk\">www.journeywise.co.uk</a>, had a glitch on its system which stopped me obtaining a quote. </p> <p>Next I tried <a href=\"http://www.screentrade.co.uk\">www.screentrade.co.uk</a>, which promises that it will offer the cheapest quote, or refund the difference between its quote and any cheaper one you obtain. It lived up to its promise. </p> <p>Screentrade asks for more information, but uses your postcode so that you don't have to type out your address. It's also a broker, so it gives you a range of quotes and, just as importantly, displays very clearly each policy's level of cover and exclusions. </p> <p>For one week in Spain, it offered me a policy from Direct Travel at \u00a39.50, but also displayed four other slightly more expensive quotes which offered higher levels of cover. For example, Direct Travel's \u00a39.50 policy gives you \u00a35m in medical expenses cover, while for \u00a315 you can have Primary Direct's policy, which pays out up to \u00a310m. </p> <p>The big savings come if you buy an annual policy. Screentrade found an annual policy, Europe only, for \u00a333 with Direct Travel, or \u00a345 for worldwide. Next was Primary Direct, with its \u00a363 worldwide policy, again offering twice as much medical expenses cover. </p> <p>Remember, travel agents are now banned from forcing you to buy their insurance, despite giving you the impression that special deals are only available if you do. A few minutes on the net can find you a deal at a fraction of the cost of the agents' cover. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Pop into a branch of Going Places and one week's travel insurance will set you back \u00a339.99. But pop on to the internet and you can find similar cover for under a tenner. Unfortunately, you have to know where to go in cyberspace, and it took me an hour before I found the best quote, from online broker www.screentrade.co.uk. I started by typing in \"travel insurance\" at www.yahoo.co.uk, which instantly came up with 281 sites offering cover, plus its own insurance centre. The list of sites was not encouraging; none of the names were instantly recognisable, many were duplicate sites, and some seemed to have travel insurance added as an afterthought following a long list of other insurances. A surprising number of US-based sites featured, which is largely useless for UK-based travellers looking to arrange insurance for a week in the Med this summer. Many are also no more than pages of information with a telephone number at the bottom. As most net users expect to be able to make an instant transaction online, the idea of having to go through a call centre as well seems to defeat the object. For example, Yahoo lists PHA (www.demon.co.uk/dayco/phatrav.html), which asked me to fill in a detailed form. But rather than giving an instant quote, it said I would be contacted by telephone or email. Two hours later, I was still waiting. Instead I tried Yahoo's own insurance centre, operated by www.insure.co.uk. Again there was a lengthy form, but at least this time I obtained a quote. For a single person on a one-week holiday in Spain in August, it gave me three quotes: \u00a313.58 via a Lloyd's syndicate, \u00a315.80 with CGU and \u00a316.40 from Axa. I also asked for quotes for an individual annual insurance policy. The same three insurers came up, this time with quotes of \u00a339, \u00a349 and \u00a360 respectively. All would allow me to buy online. These quotes were certainly a lot better than the high street (and Going Places doesn't even sell an annual policy) but they turned out not to be the best. My next move was to access one of my favourite financial sites, www.find.co.uk, which acts as a portal for a huge range of financial products. Its travel insurance centre lists 67 UK travel insurers, with a quick description so that you know if you're going to a broker or a direct seller. Sitting near the top is AA Insurance Services (www.theaa.co.uk). It had one of the most simple and user-friendly sites, but its quotes failed to live up to expectations. It offered me one-week cover at \u00a321.08 and an annual policy at \u00a389.85. www.columbusdirect.co.uk, probably the best-known cheap travel insurer, was another easy-to-use site and it offered lower quotes than the AA. It would cover me for a week for \u00a317 and \u00a359 for an annual policy - although it was still not the best. Unfortunately another cheapie, www.journeywise.co.uk, had a glitch on its system which stopped me obtaining a quote. Next I tried www.screentrade.co.uk, which promises that it will offer the cheapest quote, or refund the difference between its quote and any cheaper one you obtain. It lived up to its promise. Screentrade asks for more information, but uses your postcode so that you don't have to type out your address. It's also a broker, so it gives you a range of quotes and, just as importantly, displays very clearly each policy's level of cover and exclusions. For one week in Spain, it offered me a policy from Direct Travel at \u00a39.50, but also displayed four other slightly more expensive quotes which offered higher levels of cover. For example, Direct Travel's \u00a39.50 policy gives you \u00a35m in medical expenses cover, while for \u00a315 you can have Primary Direct's policy, which pays out up to \u00a310m. The big savings come if you buy an annual policy. Screentrade found an annual policy, Europe only, for \u00a333 with Direct Travel, or \u00a345 for worldwide. Next was Primary Direct, with its \u00a363 worldwide policy, again offering twice as much medical expenses cover. Remember, travel agents are now banned from forcing you to buy their insurance, despite giving you the impression that special deals are only available if you do. A few minutes on the net can find you a deal at a fraction of the cost of the agents' cover.",

In the pit, Lionel Friend eloquently guides the Northern Chamber Orchestra through a reminder that some occasionally inspired music suffers only in the service of some truly appalling dramaturgy. As far as a reassessment of Schubert's viability as an opera composer goes, it makes out a very good case for Rossini indeed. In repertory until July 22. Box office: 01298 72190.",

You will save money - around 30% of your total bill if you're lucky. But the effort involved to check you've got the best deal (it will take you about seven hours in all) almost outweighs the cost saving, and at the end of it you'll be left with that uneasy feeling that you may still have got it wrong. </p> <p>Choice in the gas and electricity market spells confusion rather than liberation. </p> <p>I live in a south London flat, with gas from BG and electricity from London Electricity; turning the thermostat down, lagging the loft and paying by direct debit is the most I've done to cut bills. But under the onslaught of radio and TV adverts telling me to switch (and last week Richard Branson's Virgin joined the fray) I resolved to change suppliers. </p> <p>The first hurdle is working out what you are paying. It took about an hour to accurately calculate how much I spend and how many units or kiloWatts per hour (kWh) I use. This is around 2500 kWh of electricity a year, at a cost of \u00a3204, and 15,000 kWh of gas, at a cost of \u00a3316. </p> <p>The next step is to find the list of alternative suppliers. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets' website (<a href=\"http://www.ofgem.org.uk\">www.ofgem.org.uk</a>) was useful, but basic - it doesn't include the different perks and packages that can make a large difference to your bill. </p> <p>Price comparison websites such as <a href=\"http://www.buy.co.uk\">www.buy.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.blays.co.uk\">www.blays.co.uk</a> also failed to give this information. What's more, the utility companies regularly change their prices, and as the Ofgem site is not updated every day, the only way get the most accurate quotes was to phone each company. This took five hours. </p> <p>Contacting 25 different suppliers was bad enough but comparisons were made near impossible by the variety of ways companies give quotes: </p> <p><strong> VAT.</strong> Some include it, some don't. </p> <p><strong> Staggered rates.</strong> At some you pay less the more energy you use. Others just have one standard tariff. </p> <p><strong> Standing charges.</strong> Some quote them on a daily basis, others on a quarterly basis and others on an annual basis. </p> <p><strong> Quote basis.</strong> Some give the unit prices and do a calculation for you. Others give you their prices, leaving you to calculate. Others give comparative quotes; rather than telling you their kWh price, they ask who your current supplier is then tell you how much you would save by switching. </p> <p>The results? Virgin Energy came out cheapest; \u00a3182.50 for gas (a saving of \u00a3133.50), beating Eastern Energy's \u00a3183 by only a smidgen. On electricity, Virgin was cheapest by a long shot; \u00a3146.50 (a saving of \u00a357.50), with the next best quote, \u00a3162.90, from Northern Electricity. </p> <p>British Gas, Energy Supplies UK and npower were the most expensive for gas, all quoting \u00a3220. They were also among the most expensive electricity providers, charging, respectively, \u00a3193, \u00a3197 and \u00a3200. </p> <p>The highest electricity charges were from \"green\" suppliers which use renewable sources such as wind and water, although the extra is not that much; Unit(e) quoted me \u00a3220 and Servista \u00a3213. </p> <p>Perks may also be worth considering. Amerada offers air miles, while Energy Supplies UK throws in free boiler and locksmith cover. More importantly, you can check how often switching suppliers results in a complaint, by checking Ofgem's website. The two biggest gas offenders, Midlands Gas and Northern Electric and Gas were not on my shortlist. Neither were the two worst electricity offenders, Independent Energy and Yorkshire Electricity. </p> <p>Although Virgin was best on price, I chose my new supplier on environmental grounds: the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which has an agreement with Scottish and Southern Energy, to supply energy from renewable sources. </p> <p>I will also go through RSPB for my gas. Getting gas from environmentally friendly sources is trickier than electricity, so the RSPB says it will plant trees to absorb the carbon dioxide my gas produces and fund research projects into sustainable energy instead. I worked out that I will pay about \u00a3213 a year this way. </p> <p>In short, with RSPB my bill will fall from around \u00a3500 a year to around \u00a3420.

      "body": "<p>Five months ago, the hi-tech stocks goldrush was in full frenetic swing, with private investors clambering over each other to pile money into little-known internet and technology companies, often on the basis of online bulletin board tips and outrageously optimistic predictions about prospects. </p> <p>Now, with many of these investors nursing hefty paper losses after share prices crashed in March and April, quite a few people will be wondering ruefully whether they were seduced by the shimmer of fool's gold. </p> <p>Jobs &amp; Money has looked at five stocks that were darlings of the fleeting tech stocks boom. Pacific Media, Scoot.com, Medi@Invest, Digital Animation and eVestment all featured in the top 10 most popular share purchase lists issued by stockbroker Charles Schwab during February, elbowing out the former stalwarts such as privatisation stocks. But all are now conspicuous in their absence from the latest top 10 buys list issued by Charles Schwab this week. </p> <p>The five share price graphs above vividly depict the puncturing of the dot.com bubble. Looking back at the tech stocks frenzy earlier this year, Jeremy Batstone at NatWest Stockbrokers says: \"People thought it was a casino where they couldn't lose.\" </p> <p>He was completely amazed by the willingness of many individuals to part with their cash so readily. \"It was very much a case of standing over a manhole and throwing money down it.\" </p> <p>Many small investors, nursing burnt fingers, have decided to pull out of the market altogether, while others have scaled down their trading activities. The result has been a sizeable drop in stock exchange trading volumes during the last couple of months - and fewer appearances in the press by Martha Lane Fox of lastminute.com. </p> <p>Figures from the London Stock Exchange show how online sharedealing rocketed last year, fueled by the launch of cheap net-based share trading services. The average number of transactions a day ballooned to 134,000 in January, hitting a peak of 157,000 a day in March. Since then, volumes have dropped dramatically, with May seeing just 104,000 transactions per day on average. Anecdotal evidence suggests June and July will show even more of a slump. On Monday, for example, fewer than 1bn shares changed hands - the sort of figure usually seen in the period between Christmas and new year. </p> <p>It's a far cry from February, when the share-trading boom left some of the new sharedealing services struggling. Some, such as Halifax, were forced to close their doors temporarily to new customers, while at others, such as Charles Schwab, investors complained about hour-long waits to get through on the phone. </p> <p>Although the party appears to be over, it hasn't stopped companies rushing in to join the already crowded online sharedealing market. Three weeks ago Virgin launched a service, and Egg's dealing facility goes live next week, promising \"very competitive\" fees. Ironically, details of Egg's sharedealing facility emerged in the week that its own share price hit a new low of 134.5p. </p> <p>Financial services website Interactive Investor International, has had an even tougher time. The company listed in February and the shares soared past the 400p mark. This week they stood at 45p-46p. </p> <p>It's been a similar story with our five highlighted shares: </p> <p><strong> Pacific Media.</strong> One of the most widely-held hi-tech stocks, this AIM-listed company started life running cinemas and has garnered considerable interest among investors as a result of its e-commerce dabblings.

      "bodyText": "Five months ago, the hi-tech stocks goldrush was in full frenetic swing, with private investors clambering over each other to pile money into little-known internet and technology companies, often on the basis of online bulletin board tips and outrageously optimistic predictions about prospects. Now, with many of these investors nursing hefty paper losses after share prices crashed in March and April, quite a few people will be wondering ruefully whether they were seduced by the shimmer of fool's gold. Jobs &amp; Money has looked at five stocks that were darlings of the fleeting tech stocks boom. Pacific Media, Scoot.com, Medi@Invest, Digital Animation and eVestment all featured in the top 10 most popular share purchase lists issued by stockbroker Charles Schwab during February, elbowing out the former stalwarts such as privatisation stocks. But all are now conspicuous in their absence from the latest top 10 buys list issued by Charles Schwab this week. The five share price graphs above vividly depict the puncturing of the dot.com bubble. Looking back at the tech stocks frenzy earlier this year, Jeremy Batstone at NatWest Stockbrokers says: \"People thought it was a casino where they couldn't lose.\" He was completely amazed by the willingness of many individuals to part with their cash so readily. \"It was very much a case of standing over a manhole and throwing money down it.\" Many small investors, nursing burnt fingers, have decided to pull out of the market altogether, while others have scaled down their trading activities. The result has been a sizeable drop in stock exchange trading volumes during the last couple of months - and fewer appearances in the press by Martha Lane Fox of lastminute.com. Figures from the London Stock Exchange show how online sharedealing rocketed last year, fueled by the launch of cheap net-based share trading services. The average number of transactions a day ballooned to 134,000 in January, hitting a peak of 157,000 a day in March. Since then, volumes have dropped dramatically, with May seeing just 104,000 transactions per day on average. Anecdotal evidence suggests June and July will show even more of a slump. On Monday, for example, fewer than 1bn shares changed hands - the sort of figure usually seen in the period between Christmas and new year. It's a far cry from February, when the share-trading boom left some of the new sharedealing services struggling. Some, such as Halifax, were forced to close their doors temporarily to new customers, while at others, such as Charles Schwab, investors complained about hour-long waits to get through on the phone. Although the party appears to be over, it hasn't stopped companies rushing in to join the already crowded online sharedealing market. Three weeks ago Virgin launched a service, and Egg's dealing facility goes live next week, promising \"very competitive\" fees. Ironically, details of Egg's sharedealing facility emerged in the week that its own share price hit a new low of 134.5p. Financial services website Interactive Investor International, has had an even tougher time. The company listed in February and the shares soared past the 400p mark. This week they stood at 45p-46p. It's been a similar story with our five highlighted shares: Pacific Media. One of the most widely-held hi-tech stocks, this AIM-listed company started life running cinemas and has garnered considerable interest among investors as a result of its e-commerce dabblings. From around 1p last autumn, the share price soared to 14p in late January then slumped to around 3.5p this week. Scoot.com. An online publishing and information company, it made the news last month by announcing it had won the backing of its French media and utilities group partner Vivendi to snap up the free advertising newspaper group Loot for \u00a3190m. After languishing below 50p, the share price started rising at the end of last year, hitting 351p on March 10 before promptly taking a dive. This week it stood at around 125p. Digital Animation Group. A special effects and games animation company whose biggest recent claim to fame is that it developed Ananova - billed \"the world's first virtual cyberchick newsreader\" - for the Press Association's new media division. Earlier this month Ananova and the PA division were bought by mobile phone operator Orange for \u00a395m. Despite this, the share this week stood at around 96p-98p, far below its early February high of 390p. Medi@Invest. This media and internet investment company announced in May that it had acquired 33% of computer games development company Software Creations for \u00a36.65m. The share price stood at around 7p-8p in November, topped 90p in mid-January, fell relentlessly since early February, and was back at 7p-8p on Wednesday this week. eVestment. An AIM-traded internet incubator firm that invests in young net and e-commerce-related businesses in the UK and overseas. Its share price climbed to 44p on February 11 but was this week languishing at around 11.5p. What should you do if you hold these shares? Alex Scott, internet analyst at Barclays Stockbrokers, says that in the case of Pacific Media, Digital Animation and eVestment, he would be \"steering pretty clear\". Scoot.com is likely to continue making losses for another couple of years but at least it is managing to roll out its services and show signs of delivering on its business plan. While Mr Scott doesn't regard Scoot.com as an out-and-out \"buy\", he would hold on to the shares. If there are cheap buying opportunities, it might be one where you want to build up your holding. If you bought into all these stocks last autumn, you are likely to be sitting on a gain, even after all that's happened in the last few months, says Mr Scott. As to whether you should hold or sell, it partly depends whether you can afford to hang on in the hope of a recovery that may never happen. NatWest Stockbrokers' Mr Batstone also rates Scoot.com as a \"hold,\" but has little time for Pacific Media, which he says \"was a penny share at the best of times\" and is unlikely to regain its former highs.

And Nick here too! </p> <p><strong>Ben2222</strong> So dear fellows, did you compromise any of your ideas to appeal to the damn Yanks then, chaps? </p> <p><strong>NickandPeter</strong> No, I don't believe we did compromise. We always found that DreamWorks were very respectful of us as British film-makers and gave us all the freedom we wanted to make our own movie.</p> <p><strong>Tally43 </strong> So, why chickens? Wouldn't using humans (or even dogs) have given you more options? </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> It *had* to be chickens. Scientific study proved that they are silliest animals in creation, but our idea was to do a prisoner of war escape drama with chickens. The two things have to go together. We never sat down and thought what film can we make with chickens? for example, we never thought of making the sound of music with chickens, and I'll be very happy to never have another chicken in a film again after this.</p> <p><strong>Tally43</strong> So what animals *would* you cast in Sound of Music? Or what other films should be remade with the Aardman twist? </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> Beavers as the Von Trapp family and rainbow trout as the Nazis, but perhaps Julie Andrews would be a chubb... </p> <p><strong>SKDavies2 </strong> Is DreamWorks happy that you continue to work out of Bristol? How involved were they in Chicken Run? </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> They were very happy for us to work out of Bristol. In fact, so were we! it was good to have the Atlantic ocean between us but their involvement was very useful. Jeffrey [Katzenberg] jetted over about once every nine weeks, or so. I would compare him to a football coach, really, on the sidelines, we were never under any pressure to do or change anything. there was a lot of healthy arguments but we've had that with the BBC too, with Wallace and Gromit - you get that with any production. but they were very happy to let us get on with it, really.</p> <p><strong>kd</strong> Given all the casting hoo-ha that is going on with Harry Potter, would you ever consider doing the film yourselves as clay-mation? </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> No! we like to write our own stuff, as brilliant as Harry Potter is.</p> <p><strong>Barquing</strong> Hullo chaps, without stooping to arse-licking, I really enjoyed your film. One question though, How do you determine whether or not a breed of bird is sinister (like the penguin) or heroic (like .. uh .. chickens) and does this peculiar need to animate poultry come down to some kind of masochistic streak in getting all those feathers \"just right\" ? </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> I think it's a question of either playing along with what the animal seems to suggest, or you (probably in the case of penguins and chickens) you go completely against what tyey seem to suggest. It's not so much what the animal it, it's more how it behaves, or how you can make it behave through animation. I think you can really treat any animal in any way, really. I don't think there's any rules to it. And, yes! to the masochist/chicken feathers question.</p> <p><strong>sezzyboy </strong> hiya Nick and Peter, Thought Chicken Run was great fun. However, Gilbert Adair of the Indy on Sunday obviously didn't, finding sinister overtones in many bits of the film. How do you respond to critics who are obviously miserable old gits? (And is he right with his observations?) </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> Handling the critics is something you shouldn't take too seriously. Some make good points and some completely miss the point... One critic criticised a reference to ET as being too much a Spielberg reference. I don't recall ever putting a Spielberg reference in the movie. One has to just shrug off most of these kinds of criticisms. The response I'm getting from the public is, to me, much more important. I sometimes think, it took four and a half years to make the movie - how long does it take to write the review? (Nick) </p> <p><strong>withnail20 </strong> Hello Nick and Peter, Is there to be a Rex The Runt movie? Or another series, at least? I'm a huge fan. Also, what are your thoughts on the Animal Rights activists leaping aboard the bandwagon of your film? Are you vegetarians? It'd be nice to think that sales of Free Range eggs will rise as a consequence of Chicken Run. </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> Yes, there is another series being planned, and, incidentally, Richard Goleszowski is also directing the next Aardman feature, which is roughly based on the tortoise and the hare fable. I'm not sure when the shooting of the next Rex the Runt series is planned. With regards to animal rights activists, we didn't really intend the film to have a political message, it was just a story that is as much about people as it is about chickens. I'm not particularly vegetarian but I guess I am against mass exploitation of anything, including animals. And, yes, it would be nice if Chicken Run had some influence on the egg or chicken market. </p> <p><strong>SpankTM </strong> Aside for your obvious animation skills, the films you've both worked on have revealed a real sense of narrative pacing, comic timing and the verve to pull off a big action-packed finale. Ever been tempted to apply those talents to a live-action movie? (Hey, it worked for Tim Burton...) </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> No, the simple answer is no - never have. I've occasionally done a bit of filming with real actors and I always find it totally terrifying! They don't stand still where you put them, and they need to be fed and humoured and generally looked after. the whole pace of live action always astonishes me so I think we'll stay in out own peaceful world of stop-frame. (Peter) </p> <p><strong>Datta </strong> Any clues you can give us about what's going to happen in the Wallace and Gromit movie? </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> Hi Pete here! Nick's got an idea for the next W+G movie, and I could give you a couple of hints but if I did he'd kill me. He's been guarding the secret with his life. So, sorry! </p> <p><strong>Badgerfish </strong> Hello, Do you ever lose your patience and tear the models apart in fits of ill-advised rage? </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> Almost every day an animator is tempted to do this because animation can be the most frustrating job in the world. But the animators know that if they did this they would just have to shoot the shot again and it would probably be even more work so we take out our frustration on something else. there was one time where we discovered ginger's head lying on the floor with a huge bootprint on it - some people claim it was an accident but I don't believe it! </p> <p><strong>Stephend2 </strong> It seems that long after your films are through at the cinema or TV, the characters live on in those funny sheep backpacks, talking alarm clock tableaux, and so on. Do you have any creative control over the merchandising that gets made as a result of your work? </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> With W+G merchandising, because it happened relatively slowly, over several years we did manage to keep quite strong creative control over it, which I'm very happy about. To be honest, with CR, Nick and I haven't had the time or the opportunity to keep tight creative control over every detail, but we have a department at Aardman who look after things on our behalf on this side of the Atlantic. And Dreamworks look after things in America. (Peter) </p> <p><strong>RichardM</strong> Would you consider doing a full length feature in any medium other than clay, or do you think it's better to stick to your own niche? I was glad to see that barring Yank/Aussie Mel Gibson Chicken Run made no concessions in terms of setting, vocabulary and accents to the American audience. Is the intention for this to continue, or will the next film be something like Wallace and Gromit do America? Or if not Wallace and Gromit are you planning any US-based characters at the behest of DreamWorks? </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> Yes, thanks! we tried out hardest to make the film British in every way and we certainly don't intend to start making films set in America, or with more American characters. we think that we do our best work making films about what we know, and Chicken Run has been successful enough in America to prove what we've always believed - that the American public can enjoy a very British film if it's well done. I don't expect that there'll be any guest American voices in the next W+G film, but Nick loves to surprise us so who knows? (Peter) </p> <p><strong>MeatTakeshi </strong> Afternoon chaps. The Tortoise and the Hare is your next feature, have you signed any vocal talent onboard yet? If so will you be casting another US box office draw, such as Mel Gibson? There was talk of a Chicken Run sequel as the 4th feature in your DreamWorks deal dependent on box office, recent reports have suggested this is dead and buried, is this case? Will we ever see the return of Feathers McGraw, the most feared bird since Joan of Arc? </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> No, no voices signed up yet for the Tortoise and the Hare but, again, it's going to be set in Britain and we think we'll have some good and surprising names for you. as far as I'm concerned, there has been no talk of a Chicken Run sequel. And Nick and I aren't interested in doing one, certainly not at the moment, We're chickened out! </p> <p><strong>Tamara </strong> Hi chaps. Were you worried, with Mel Gibson involved, that Chicken Run wouldn't be historically accurate and that decent, honest British chickens would be made to look like complete bastards? </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> We think we've done our bit to set poultry history to rights. Everything that rocky does in the film can be supported by reliable documentary evidence. As you see, British chickens are uniformly honest and honourable. </p> <p><strong>dan314 </strong> Hello. Where does your curious obsession with machinery, which seems to feature in much of your work (from trousers to chicken pie machines) come from? Also, if the wrong trousers were wrong before they went wrong, what was wrong with them in the first place?! </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> It's funny about the obsession with machinery. I think there's lots of references. Nick and I are both fans of the English illustrator Heath Robinson. The styling of the machines seems to be derived from sci-fi of the 50s, maybe films like HG Wells The Time Machine, but also miraculous machines that can do anything, have always been a popular favourite in comics and cartoons. I'm sure that Beano characters in the past were always building amazing machines like this, and think of Wily Coyote who sends of to the ACME company for machines that can do just about anything. We're both frustrated inventors, really, and through animation we can make machines that really work. (Peter) </p> <p>ASIDE: <strong>RichardM </strong> dan314&gt; Surely the trousers weren't wrong in the sense that they had gone wrong. Wallace fell into them and on realising that they weren't his trousers that he was expecting to fall out of bed into exclaimed something like: \"They're the wrong trousers!\" </p> <p><strong>Datta </strong> RichardM/dan314&gt; \"Gromit! It's the wrong trousers! And they've gone wrong!\" </p> <p><strong>RichardM </strong> Datta&gt; Ah, yes! So it's both, and they were only wrong after Feathers McGraw had tampered with them. </p> <p><strong>grover </strong> In a recent documentary where I first saw your faces, I couldn't take my eyes from your mouth movements - identical to your creations'. Since everyone in Aardman must master these idiosyncratic \"GromitGrimace\" expressions in their work, and since these so obviously originated from your own mirror, my question is this: does everyone working at Aardman now move their mouth like yours? </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> Yes, it's part of the job description for any animator that they have to move their mouth exactly like me! (Nick) </p> <p><strong>yurigagarin </strong> Hi, Nick and Peter What did you make of Toy Story, and how do you think the Americans regard your style of animation? Do they think it's quaint and English, or do they wish they had the artistry to make films like that too? </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> Speaking, for Nick here, I think we're both fans of both the Toy Story films, John (Lasseter) is a great director, and he tells really good stories which is the most important thing. The Americans do seem to find something special in the Englishness of our work. I suppose the humour is much less familiar to them than it is to an English audience. Whatever the reason, they have given us great reviews! </p> <p><strong>naomi2 </strong> What's your favourite scene in the movie? When I saw it the pie machine sequence brought the house down </p> <p><strong>Nick and Peter</strong> The pie machine sequence is the most action-packed scene, apart from the ending but it's hard to choose a favourite really as different scenes have their own merits, like the dance scene. I particularly like the scene of Rocky and Ginger up on the roof chatting, which I think is beautifully animated by our Belgian animator Guionne Leroy. It's very sensitive and touching. (Nick) I like the scene at the end when Fowler reminds us of what the joke of the whole film is - all these heroics and they're *just* chickens! (Peter)</p> <p> <strong>Nick and Peter</strong> Bye now - we've got to dash off to a signing session at Borders on Oxford Street for 7pm. Thanks for all your questions, it was nice chatting and sorry we didn't have time to answer all of them. Bye!</p> <p> <strong>Unanswered questions</strong></p> <p><strong>sezzyboy </strong> I have to say that I think Feathers McGraw is my favourite character ever. How can a mute penguin be so insanely evil??? So who are Peter &amp; Nick's favourites?? </p> <p><strong>Hussain </strong> I am a student who will be studying Film &amp; Video at Surrey Institute. I am very pleased that British animation has been recognised by Hollywood. I hope that both of you will establish your own production company to rival. Dreamwoks and Disney. By the way! Where is my all time hero MORPH? A quick suggestion I along with countless others would like to see a MORPH movie. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK! </p> <p><strong>schindler </strong> Hi Nick and Peter, I haven't seen Chicken Run - it's not out in Germany yet. Do you have any control over the synchronisation when your films are dubbed into foreign languages? If so, by what criteria do you judge the voices chosen for the different characters. </p> <p><strong>blackbird21 </strong> did you have specific actors in mind when you came up with the idea for chicken run? <strong>sezzyboy </strong> Hello again, Atom films has been a pretty big success. Do you think by the time the next Wallace and Gromit (feature) film comes out, everyone will just sit at home and download it off the internet? I think what I'm trying to say is: you seem to be able to use the modern (internet) and the traditional (claymation) to your advantage. Where would you prefer your films to be shown? on the net or in the cinema? </p> <p><strong>barquing </strong> How do you respond to accusations of being too English and perhaps too twee? </p> <p><strong>Ben2222 </strong> Which clay animation person/chicken did you like animating the best? </p> <p><strong>Berious </strong> Hello gentlemen, So, are either of you vegetarian, or do you regularly enjoy chicken? </p> <p><strong>dan314 </strong> Me again. What came first, Peter Sallis' voice, or Wallace? </p> <p><strong>rgsharp </strong> Do you ever feel like making a 'serious' film? </p> <p><strong>RichardM </strong> \"I'll be very happy to never have another chicken in a film again after this\". Glad to hear that. Someone above mentioned a Chicken Run 2. I feel that would be a mistake.</p>",

Or if not Wallace and Gromit are you planning any US-based characters at the behest of DreamWorks? Nick and Peter Yes, thanks! we tried out hardest to make the film British in every way and we certainly don't intend to start making films set in America, or with more American characters. we think that we do our best work making films about what we know, and Chicken Run has been successful enough in America to prove what we've always believed - that the American public can enjoy a very British film if it's well done. I don't expect that there'll be any guest American voices in the next W+G film, but Nick loves to surprise us so who knows? (Peter) MeatTakeshi Afternoon chaps. The Tortoise and the Hare is your next feature, have you signed any vocal talent onboard yet? If so will you be casting another US box office draw, such as Mel Gibson? There was talk of a Chicken Run sequel as the 4th feature in your DreamWorks deal dependent on box office, recent reports have suggested this is dead and buried, is this case? Will we ever see the return of Feathers McGraw, the most feared bird since Joan of Arc? Nick and Peter No, no voices signed up yet for the Tortoise and the Hare but, again, it's going to be set in Britain and we think we'll have some good and surprising names for you. as far as I'm concerned, there has been no talk of a Chicken Run sequel. And Nick and I aren't interested in doing one, certainly not at the moment, We're chickened out! Tamara Hi chaps. Were you worried, with Mel Gibson involved, that Chicken Run wouldn't be historically accurate and that decent, honest British chickens would be made to look like complete bastards? Nick and Peter We think we've done our bit to set poultry history to rights. Everything that rocky does in the film can be supported by reliable documentary evidence. As you see, British chickens are uniformly honest and honourable. dan314 Hello. Where does your curious obsession with machinery, which seems to feature in much of your work (from trousers to chicken pie machines) come from? Also, if the wrong trousers were wrong before they went wrong, what was wrong with them in the first place?! Nick and Peter It's funny about the obsession with machinery. I think there's lots of references. Nick and I are both fans of the English illustrator Heath Robinson. The styling of the machines seems to be derived from sci-fi of the 50s, maybe films like HG Wells The Time Machine, but also miraculous machines that can do anything, have always been a popular favourite in comics and cartoons. I'm sure that Beano characters in the past were always building amazing machines like this, and think of Wily Coyote who sends of to the ACME company for machines that can do just about anything. We're both frustrated inventors, really, and through animation we can make machines that really work. (Peter) ASIDE: RichardM dan314&gt; Surely the trousers weren't wrong in the sense that they had gone wrong. Wallace fell into them and on realising that they weren't his trousers that he was expecting to fall out of bed into exclaimed something like: \"They're the wrong trousers!\" Datta RichardM/dan314&gt; \"Gromit! It's the wrong trousers! And they've gone wrong!\" RichardM Datta&gt; Ah, yes! So it's both, and they were only wrong after Feathers McGraw had tampered with them. grover In a recent documentary where I first saw your faces, I couldn't take my eyes from your mouth movements - identical to your creations'. Since everyone in Aardman must master these idiosyncratic \"GromitGrimace\" expressions in their work, and since these so obviously originated from your own mirror, my question is this: does everyone working at Aardman now move their mouth like yours? Nick and Peter Yes, it's part of the job description for any animator that they have to move their mouth exactly like me! (Nick) yurigagarin Hi, Nick and Peter What did you make of Toy Story, and how do you think the Americans regard your style of animation? Do they think it's quaint and English, or do they wish they had the artistry to make films like that too? Nick and Peter Speaking, for Nick here, I think we're both fans of both the Toy Story films, John (Lasseter) is a great director, and he tells really good stories which is the most important thing. The Americans do seem to find something special in the Englishness of our work. I suppose the humour is much less familiar to them than it is to an English audience. Whatever the reason, they have given us great reviews! naomi2 What's your favourite scene in the movie? When I saw it the pie machine sequence brought the house down Nick and Peter The pie machine sequence is the most action-packed scene, apart from the ending but it's hard to choose a favourite really as different scenes have their own merits, like the dance scene. I particularly like the scene of Rocky and Ginger up on the roof chatting, which I think is beautifully animated by our Belgian animator Guionne Leroy. It's very sensitive and touching. (Nick) I like the scene at the end when Fowler reminds us of what the joke of the whole film is - all these heroics and they're *just* chickens! (Peter) Nick and Peter Bye now - we've got to dash off to a signing session at Borders on Oxford Street for 7pm. Thanks for all your questions, it was nice chatting and sorry we didn't have time to answer all of them. Bye! Unanswered questions sezzyboy I have to say that I think Feathers McGraw is my favourite character ever. How can a mute penguin be so insanely evil??? So who are Peter &amp; Nick's favourites?? Hussain I am a student who will be studying Film &amp; Video at Surrey Institute. I am very pleased that British animation has been recognised by Hollywood. I hope that both of you will establish your own production company to rival. Dreamwoks and Disney. By the way! Where is my all time hero MORPH? A quick suggestion I along with countless others would like to see a MORPH movie. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK! schindler Hi Nick and Peter, I haven't seen Chicken Run - it's not out in Germany yet. Do you have any control over the synchronisation when your films are dubbed into foreign languages? If so, by what criteria do you judge the voices chosen for the different characters. blackbird21 did you have specific actors in mind when you came up with the idea for chicken run? sezzyboy Hello again, Atom films has been a pretty big success. Do you think by the time the next Wallace and Gromit (feature) film comes out, everyone will just sit at home and download it off the internet? I think what I'm trying to say is: you seem to be able to use the modern (internet) and the traditional (claymation) to your advantage. Where would you prefer your films to be shown? on the net or in the cinema? barquing How do you respond to accusations of being too English and perhaps too twee? Ben2222 Which clay animation person/chicken did you like animating the best? Berious Hello gentlemen, So, are either of you vegetarian, or do you regularly enjoy chicken? dan314 Me again. What came first, Peter Sallis' voice, or Wallace? rgsharp Do you ever feel like making a 'serious' film? RichardM \"I'll be very happy to never have another chicken in a film again after this\". Glad to hear that. Someone above mentioned a Chicken Run 2. I feel that would be a mistake.",

Unfortunately that was where Sanz's son Fernando played, and instead he blew \u00a325m on Nicholas Anelka.) Real's second Champions League victory in two years has made him the most successful Madrid president for a generation, and he is quick to remind supporters that: \"Nobody can prevent me from appearing, like Santiago Bernabeu, in the golden history book of the club.\"</p> <p>One man who would like to try is his rival for the presidency, Lorenzo Perez. Perez, whose prospects were written off completely at the start of the race, needed something to perk up his campaign, and so duly made made what seemed like an outrageous pledge: to bring Barcelona's Luis Figo to Real if he won. And this despite the player's \u00a340m buy-out clause in his contract. Zinedine Zidane might be on his way as well too, he hinted.

A cool \u00a32m advance plus \u00a35m-a-year in wages. </p> <p>The next day events took a further twist when the Spanish daily Marca revealed they were in possession of a contract - dated July 1st and signed by Figo's agent Jose Veiga - stating that Figo would pay Florentino \u00a320m if he didn't sign for the European champions. Additionally, the document also committed Perez to giving Figo \u00a320m if he became Real president and then didn't sign him. The deal looked done and delivered. The only question was whether the Madrid fans would take the Figo bait and elect Perez?</p> <p>The press had a field day, dubbing the saga \"The Figo Affair.\" But secretly Sanz was seething. And earlier this week he launched the imaginatively titled: 'Save Real Madrid' campaign. Or more accurately, save it from Perez and Figo. \"These cheap shots at buying votes offered by the other candidate have one objective which is none other than to keep the club for himself,\" Sanz claimed. \"However, our members aren't stupid. They won't allow themselves to be bought.\" </p> <p>Sanz then announced he would send a video of Figo - his hair dyed in Barcelona colours - insulting Real after Barca won the Primeria Liga last year (\"Madridistas, cry babies, hail the champions!\") to all 66,000 members with a vote to remind them of the Portuguese players past sins. And the following day he announced that he'd made an offer \u00a315m offer for Mallorca striker Diego Tristan. \"The signing of Diego Tristan is a reality, unlike the nonsense circulating regarding Luis Figo,\" he claimed.</p> <p>The past few days have seen a further spate of claims and denials as both candidates attempt to steal a march on the other. But it is still an exercise in democracy that is completely alien to our domestic leagues. Much of this is down to the structure of Spanish football. While most Premiership clubs are plcs, in Spanish law football clubs are non-profitable institutions. You can't buy shares in Real Madrid or Barcelona - instead you become a member (usually by purchasing a season ticket) which entitles you to vote in the elections for the president and board.</p> <p>But despite the seeming advantages of this system over our own locked boys' club, not everyone is convinced. \"The media are covering the Real Madrid and Barcelona elections like a political election,\" says Inigo Gurruchaga, the London correspondent of El Correo. \"In England no-one knows who the chairman of West Ham is, but in Spain they are on the TV and radio every day. It's a kind of sickness in Spanish football.\" </p> <p>And a political campaign that is closer to a beauty contest is not necessarily good news for the club either. Becuase the members aren't accountable for the debts of the club, they usually vote for the biggest sugar Daddy. As Gurruchaga puts it: \"The members don't care - they are not going to incur any debts. Real are massively in debt: \u00a372.7m according to Sanz and \u00a3163m according to Perez, but nobody is that bothered.</p> <p>\"What happens is that the chairman postpones the debts and postpones the problems for the next chairman. The supporters don't mind - because if you are a member you are not responsible for the debts of the club - and they are getting to watch the best players in the world \"</p> <p>And finally, as anarchists have long pointed out, if voting changed anything they'd abolish it: like most elections, the incumbent usually wins. \"In Spain the elections are pretty much decided beforehand because the president has all the power.

      "body": "<p>\"Eton man makes good in Tory party\" isn't the sort of story to cause a stir, particularly when it involves nothing more dramatic than the swapping of one mop-headed ex-public schoolboy for a fresher model. Political correspondents, who struggle to recall the names of the Tory front bench, rarely take an interest in a candidate who hasn't yet made it into parliament; not least one whose idea of a maiden speech probably has more to do with elocution lessons for pretty young ladies than with the boring old business of running the country.</p> <p>But the decision last night of the Henley local party to adopt the Spectator's editor, Boris Johnson, as its candidate for the next election, after Michael Heseltine's retirement, has made it on to the broadsheet front pages and even turned up in the tabloids. That's a better publicity hit rate than Boris's party leader achieved with yesterday's huffing and puffing in the Commons over new Labour's management of parliament. And we all know why it happens: bumbling Boris makes for good copy even if he is - as one paper put it - \"more teddy bear than Tarzan\".</p> <p>Whether it's moaning at the BBC's \"vocal correctness\", which supposedly got him sacked from Radio 4 in favour of others with more plebeian vowels, or tut-tutting round the Glastonbury festival with professional lefty Billy Bragg, Boris certainly knows how to get attention. He will be a cheerful face in a parliament more noted for its nonentities and is welcome just for that.</p> <p>Not that parliament likes new members to get above themselves.

      "bodyText": "\"Eton man makes good in Tory party\" isn't the sort of story to cause a stir, particularly when it involves nothing more dramatic than the swapping of one mop-headed ex-public schoolboy for a fresher model. Political correspondents, who struggle to recall the names of the Tory front bench, rarely take an interest in a candidate who hasn't yet made it into parliament; not least one whose idea of a maiden speech probably has more to do with elocution lessons for pretty young ladies than with the boring old business of running the country. But the decision last night of the Henley local party to adopt the Spectator's editor, Boris Johnson, as its candidate for the next election, after Michael Heseltine's retirement, has made it on to the broadsheet front pages and even turned up in the tabloids. That's a better publicity hit rate than Boris's party leader achieved with yesterday's huffing and puffing in the Commons over new Labour's management of parliament. And we all know why it happens: bumbling Boris makes for good copy even if he is - as one paper put it - \"more teddy bear than Tarzan\". Whether it's moaning at the BBC's \"vocal correctness\", which supposedly got him sacked from Radio 4 in favour of others with more plebeian vowels, or tut-tutting round the Glastonbury festival with professional lefty Billy Bragg, Boris certainly knows how to get attention. He will be a cheerful face in a parliament more noted for its nonentities and is welcome just for that. Not that parliament likes new members to get above themselves. Some MPs still snigger behind Charles Kennedy's back at his stint as a Radio 4 quiz presenter. Giles Brandreth never recovered from his years wearing woolly jumpers and writing comical books, even though he became a more than adequate junior whip, and Sebastian Coe didn't flourish as a Cornish MP for all his ability to run 1,500 metres in record time. Only the independent MP, Martin Bell, the former BBC correspondent with a fondness for white suits and overlooked causes, has made much of an impact recently as an MP whose fame springs from a life before politics. Precedent doesn't suggest that Boris Johnson's selection will lead to a flood of B-list MPs. Don't expect Geri Haliwell to leap forward to replace Betty Boothroyd in West Bromwich or Tim Henman to oust Jack Straw in Blackburn. But Boris will triumph. Not because he's already known to every Henley voter as 'Boris off the telly', but because behind his foppish manner Johnson is the very model of a post-modern politician. While new Labour wallows in the dark ages of spin, Boris has perfected post-spin: spin so clever one can't see it happening; spin so good it makes the spun feel warm and cuddly. Like Ken Clarke - who, brilliantly, hired a white self-drive transit van to move out of 11 Downing Street the day after the election - Boris is the kind of politician who cheers us up by appearing to regard the whole political game as rather silly. The kind of politician who makes gaffes and is loved for it; the kind we might actually want to go on holiday with. The trick is to do things greyer men and women spend their time avoiding.

Clothes are something worn by just about everyone in the world, every day; the number of people worldwide who regularly wear couture could probably squeeze into a Lear jet. Couture gowns are pawns in a game of power, money, taste and folly: just like the emperor\u0092s new clothes, except real and truly beautiful. But don\u0092t waste your time coveting them \u0096 believe me, if your name\u0092s not on the Forbes list, you can\u0092t even afford a pair of tights. </p> <p>Which brings us to the question of why we, those not on the Lear jet, should be interested in haute couture. Couture is a celebration of the pinnacle of the art and craft of fashion, what-if fantasies painstakingly brought to life: practicality is ignored since its customers are unlikely to run for the bus. Garments are individually made by the most highly skilled dressmakers in the world. Couture ateliers are the only places left where precious jewels are hand-sewn on to chiffon or lookalike tiger skin made by handpainting cowhide with hair-dye. </p> <p>With so few people able to afford couture (a dress costs around \u00a320,000), the power balance is different from that in mainstream fashion, where the designer ego is all. Big spenders are seen as saintly preservers of vanishing traditions. Inevitably, there is an uneasy balance between the designers\u0092 vision and the tastes of rich old women \u0096 how else to explain the perennial popularity of enormous paste earrings in couture? </p> <p>There is, however, a new guard in town. The front row at Versace on Saturday held Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Lopez, Milla Jovovich, Anna Friel and almost no one over 45. These young things undoubtedly have money to spend, but their most valuable currency is their flashbulb-appeal, the ability to wear a gown and work it on a red carpet. Change is in the air and it might well be the saviour of couture, which a few years ago was written off as a dying art. </p> <p>The question is, who will sink and who will swim in the new order. In this haughty world, Donatella Versace is privately sneered at. \u0093Of course, it\u0092s not really couture,\u0094 one front-rower whispered and certainly some of her wool skirt suits and tight trousers would not be out of place on a ready-to-wear catwalk. But evening dresses in pleated pastel chiffon, modest from the front, elegantly spare from the back, had that crucial I-want-it-now appeal, as did tulip-sleeved fitted coats, fastened with amber and crystal. </p> <p>Surprise hit of the week was Louis Feraud, a house most famous for a white sundress worn by Bardot. Following Feraud\u0092s death last year, this was the first collection by Yves Mispelaere, who has worked at Valentino and Prada. Miro-esque dots, triangles and half-moons were balanced by simple 20s shapes and given life with delicate pleats and quirky accessories, such as Faberg\u00e9 egg bags and op art tights. </p> <p>Ungaro is another traditional couture house refusing to be left behind. With a little help from young Italian designer Giambattista Valli, 67-year-old Emanuel Ungaro created some of the week\u0092s strongest eveningwear: curvy, textured lace-and-satin floor-length gowns, executed with a modern lightness of touch. </p> <p>At Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld strayed no further than the house archives for inspiration. No matter \u0096 while ready-to-wear relies on the oxygen of new trends, couture is all about perfecting individual items. Shrug-soft coats in boucl\u00e9 wool were crowd pleasers, while the trademark quilting appeared in pale pink satin as the cosiest of suits and as inspiration for 20s-style evening dresses checkered with chiffon. </p> <p>Once the wild card of Paris fashion, Jean Paul Gaultier has become quite the respectable couturier. While others showed in underground vaults or swimming pools, Gaultier stayed true to tradition: gilt chairs in chandeliered rooms. The show was a love letter to Paris: \u0093Paris je t\u0092aime\u0094 was a slinky, backless black jersey and satin dress, saucily cut away at the sides; \u0093A Paris y\u0092a la Tour Eiffel\u0094 a floor-length flesh slip with the city\u0092s most famous landmark in sparkling black beads. Once again, shapes were either floor-length and dramatic or simple 20s knee-length; both truly elegant. </p> <p>John Galliano\u0092s insistence on being increasingly outr\u00e9 each season makes for fantastic theatre but does beg the question of what he will do once he has taken Dior right to the end of the garden path. This season we had Edwardian matrons trussed up in buckled bustiers, Sophie Dahl in a French maid\u0092s costume, a model in a judge\u0092s wig with a rope around her neck. But Galliano\u0092s genius is such that you think, what a beautiful dress and then notice the beachball-sized shoulder pads and pearl handcuffs. </p> <p>Alexander McQueen finally tired of bondage and gimp masks, presenting a Givenchy collection that was upbeat and colourful. But you still need no bottom and a lot of cheek to wear these clothes: red leather trousers had corset-lacing spiralling around the hips, while a diamant\u00e9-flecked nude mesh catsuit was decent only with the help of a G-string and a draping of long blonde hair. </p> <p>Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, showing couture for the first time, won over the audience with his witty, lovingly crafted clothes and hats. Valentino played to the gallery with wool daywear and satin and lace for evening, skilfully knotted and draped to flatter. Yves Saint Laurent played safe with his signature masculine silhouette for day; evening coats were strongest, including a black velvet parka with white fur hood and a feather cape. </p> <p>Too much is never enough for Christian Lacroix. Doublet jacket in rhinestone-trimmed tapestry over a wraparound dress in quilted white satin, edged in red velvet, worn with a patchwork bustier, anyone? Personally, if I had that kind of cash, I wouldn\u0092t spend it on a dress that made me look like the back end of a pantomime horse. But who knows? Money does strange things to people, after all.</p>",

The policies, which were largely welcomed by teaching unions, are intended to halt the crisis in recruiting and retaining teachers, which the Lib Dems blamed on low morale and stress resulting from what they saw as an excessive workload imposed by the government's education reforms.

Speaking at a school in Surbiton in the London borough of Kingston upon Thames, Mr Kennedy said: \"We are facing a national disaster in recruitment and retainment of teachers, and endless form-filling and bureacracy only adds to their already high levels of stress.

      "bodyText": "Detectives investigating the disappearance of eight-year-old Sarah Payne were tonight examining a white van similar to one spotted near the lane where she vanished. The Transit-type vehicle is one of several vans being looked at by officers involved in the inquiry, said police in Littlehampton, West Sussex. Chief superintendent Mike Alderson, spokesman for the inquiry team, said the van was still being examined by forensic experts. Police appealed for anyone with information about a white van being worked on at the time of Sarah's disappearance, nearly two weeks ago, to come forward. They are particularly keen to hear from anyone who knows about the removal of white, windowless rear doors or wood panelling from inside a van Mr Alderson said: \"We are examining a white van which has had some modifications made to it but this might not be the same white van that was seen at the time of Sarah's disappearance.\" Despite massive public interest in the case, which has resulted in more than 17,000 telephone calls to police, detectives have so far been unable to find any trace of Sarah, who was last seen at Kingston Gorse, near East Preston, West Sussex, on July 1. Detectives were now preparing themselves for a lengthy operation, a news conference was told today. Detective superintendent Alan Ladley, leading the inquiry, said his team accepted that the likelihood of Sarah being found alive was low. \"Obviously as time goes on and the fact that we have had no confirmed sightings of Sarah, it becomes less likely,\" he said. The search today was again focused on a corridor heading north from Worthing along the A24, past Horsham and Crawley towards the M25 and London. Police are concentrating their efforts on the more rural areas and have sent letters to residents in those areas appealing for information. Mr Ladley said the sighting of a girl fitting Sarah's description at the Granada services, Knutsford, on the M6 in Cheshire remained unresolved. A man spotted with the child, who said her name was Sarah, at 5am on Sunday July 2 has still not come forward. The man police want to question is described as white, aged about 30, about 6ft tall with a solid build, crinkly sandy hair, a strong jaw and a wide nose. He was wearing washed-out black jeans, a dark grey bomber jacket and a plum shirt. Sarah's parents, Sara and Michael Payne, both 31, again spoke about their anguish at a specially arranged interview at a hotel in Arundel. Despite police fears that their daughter may now be dead, they were still clinging to the hope she would be found safe and well. Mrs Payne said: \"She is definitely alive. We all remain absolutely positive about that.\" She appealed to whoever may be holding Sarah, saying: \"Give her back to us, she belongs to us.\"",

Seven-year-old Chacelle and nine-year-old Jerome are woken by nightmares of police batons and handcuffs, of officers screaming at their parents. Sixteen-year-old Tyrone creeps into their bed in the middle of the night, stiff with unspoken fears.</p> <p>To their friends they are a delightful family. The children are polite and popular at school and to the people living in their quiet north London street they are model neighbours. Delroy paints the outside of their home white once a year to keep it looking fresh. The front garden with its carefully tended plants and jolly gnomes is his pride and joy, and when the man next door needs some gardening done or the woman across the road needs a lift to the hospital they turn to Delroy.</p> <p>But for some of the police the Lindos are trouble. They are the kind who breach the peace and commit public order offences. The kind who helped clear Winston Silcott's name of the murder of PC Keith Blakelock during the Broadwater Farm riots of 1985. The riots proved a watershed in the fraught relationship between black Britain and the police. Many black people still feel criminalised for their blackness, and many officers are yet to forgive Silcott for the crime he did not commit - despite the fact that last year he was paid \u00a350,000 compensation for wrongful arrest and imprisonment.</p> <p>As soon as Silcott was charged Delroy started campaigning for his release. The two had grown up together in Tottenham, they ran around together, set up a mobile disco, became community leaders. Delroy and Silcott were known to the police for two reasons. They had a couple of convictions to their name - though it is almost 20 years since Delroy was convicted of an offence. They were also vocal in their campaign against police harassment, relentless in their pursuit of better facilities for local kids.</p> <p>Silcott was best man when Delroy married Sonia 18 years ago. Delroy says they made for an odd couple, what with Silcott towering well over 6ft tall and Delroy tiny, pittering about in his size six shoes. But they were best mates, and you have to fight for your best mate. That's when life took a turn for the worse.</p> <p>Last December Delroy was arrested and charged with three offences, most seriously the assault of two officers. That took the number of charges to 19 since Silcott's imprisonment, including two against Sonia. All the previous 16 have been defeated, but at a cost. \"I lost so much weight because of all this. I used to be a size 10 and dropped to below an eight,\" Sonia says. \"I was too sick to do my job, I just wanted to stay in bed. Sometimes it's really hard to face another day. When I start to think what's happened to us, I just break into uncontrollable tears\u0085\"</p> <p>\"Sometimes she just breaks down,\" Delroy says. He apologises for finishing Sonia's sentence for her, but says it just happens that way when you live and work together as a team.</p> <p>Sonia, a housing manager for Haringey council, had been off work for six months suffering from stress and was due to go back just before the family were hit with the latest court case.</p> <p>Like all the incidents, it is as mundane as it is implausible. Delroy says that the Lindos and their two youngest children were at the library on December 13 when an SOS call came through on his mobile. Their oldest son Tyrone told his dad he was being attacked by a middle-aged white man a couple of roads away. The family jumped in their car and rushed to the scene.</p> <p>Delroy says he was angry but calm and repeatedly asked the white man why he had hit his son. When the police arrived, Delroy claims they ignored the assault on Tyrone and simply insisted that Delroy hand over his car keys so they could move his car. When Delroy refused, saying he would move the car himself, PC Michael Aldridge drew his extended baton and moved towards him. In short, Delroy says the police attacked him, while the police allege that Delroy attacked them.</p> <p>Now Sonia is nursing physical injuries too. She claims she was punched by a policeman, fracturing the bone underneath her eye. \"When I blow my nose there is still blood there under the bone,\" she says baldly. The injury will need plastic surgery. Delroy came out of the incident with injuries to his knees, ankles, shoulder, hand and ribs. The Lindos have taken out a civil case, charging the police with malicious prosecution, assault and false imprisonment. But it cannot be heard until Delroy's criminal case is sorted.</p> <p>After Silcott was convicted for the murder of PC Blakelock, Delroy went on the road. He talked to anybody who would listen, told them that not only was Silcott innocent of the Blakelock murder but that he had also been wrongfully convicted of the murder of Anthony Smith - Silcott has always insisted that he stabbed him in self-defence after being attacked. He told meeting after meeting how, following the riots, the Metropolitan police went round Broadwater Farm breaking down any number of doors in the name of justice, scaring the life out of innocent people. They needed a culprit. When they arrested Silcott, who is still serving a life sentence for the murder of Smith, Delroy knew they had convicted the wrong man. \"I knew I had to do something, but when I started the campaign I had no idea it would lead to all this.\"</p> <p>After Silcott's arrest the police came looking for Delroy, first of all at the jobcentre. \"I was with my child who was one at the time. They took me to Chingford police station which was about 10 miles away. They just kept me there, no charges or nothing . . .\" Eventually he was released. The police then came to his house, tried to beat the door down, but a crowd of friends had gathered to make it impossible.</p> <p>Although he proved he was not at Broadwater Farm that day, he claims the police continued to harass him. \"They just kept saying, 'We're going to get you like we got Winston.'\"</p> <p>Before long Delroy was talking at meetings about his case as well as Winston's. Tonight he explains to a crowd of around 100 at the local leisure centre how the two are inextricably bound. Many people know him, and share his quiet outrage. He believes life could have been different if he'd kept his opinions to himself. \"Other people who face this kind of thing just shut up about it, whereas I'm probably different. I say well, let's have a march, let's picket Hornsey police station or whatever, so they see me as a voice they need to shut up.\"</p> <p>By the late 80s life had become unbearable for the Lindos. The council transferred them from Tottenham to neighbouring Hornsey, but he claims it made no difference and the police continued to shadow and taunt him. In 1988, the Lindos left England for Florida, where they lived with Sonia's mother for three years. But without friends and work it wasn't life. After three years they moved back to Britain.</p> <p>Delroy claims at the meeting that in the past two years police harassment has escalated - at the same time as William Macpherson was completing his inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence and the Met promised to tackle institutionalised racism within the force. Delroy acknowledges the irony without a smile.</p> <p>He says the only reason he has defeated the 16 charges is because he and Sonia have scrupulously investigated all the evidence themselves. In effect, they have become their own briefs. Delroy has had to give up full-time work - he also used to be a housing manager, before becoming an information officer for the Spinal Injuries Association. Some of the charges have been dropped before court, some have changed into lesser charges with no explanation (a \"threat to kill\" became a vague \"threatening behaviour\") before being thrown out of court. The day before the last arrest, the Observer printed an interview with Winston Silcott. As Delroy was walking from the newsagent with his paper, he was stopped by a police officer who asked \"Reading about Silcott are you? Hope it makes good reading.\"</p> <p>Highgate magistrates court: Six months have passed since Delroy was charged. His smart suit and easy smile fail to mask his anxiety. Even innocent men need luck. The courtroom is cramped and stuffy, too small to contain the family's friends. Outside, supporters sing songs of anger.</p> <p>Four uniformed policemen give evidence. None of them mentions investigating the attack on Delroy's son Tyrone. Delroy is alleged to have assaulted PC Aldridge, who describes him as \"the most violent man I have encountered in 11 years of policing\". There are murmurs of disbelief from the supporters at the back of court.</p> <p>The defence asks the police how Delroy could have kicked them, as they claim, when there were four officers holding him down - two on his arms, two on his legs. They ask what he was wearing on his feet. The police cannot remember. Delroy says he was wearing trainers.</p> <p>Throughout the two-day trial, he sits taut in the dock. Giving evidence, he states and restates that he neither abused nor assaulted the officers. \"I know the consequences of assaulting an officer and wouldn't do it.\"</p> <p>\"Why didn't you call the police if you thought your son was in danger?\" the prosecution asks.</p> <p>\"How could I call the police? The amount of harassment I've had outside my house. I didn't trust the police.\"</p> <p>Every time he alludes to his history with the police, his barrister winces. It could prejudice the magistrates against his case. Delroy says he thinks the police are mistaken in their account of the incident. He refuses to say they are lying. The prosecution asks how every policeman can have made exactly the same mistake. It's a crucial blunder. The clerk is forced to correct her. He tells the magistrates that's the trouble, the police have not made the same mistake - all four have told different stories: PC Aldridge's colleague PC Martin Lycett says he saw no physical violence or assault by Delroy.</p> <p>A defence witness confidently tells the court that she has worked closely with the police and judiciary in her job as a criminal journalist, is not a great friend of the Lindos but knows them to say hello to. She says she saw the whole incident, her professional curiosity aroused by the jam of police cars: \"I saw Mr Lindo face down on the floor. He was stationary. I kept up observations for a full hour and witnessed everything. I saw Mr Lindo being placed in the police van. He was perfectly calm, he walked in there without a struggle and sat down. At no time did he resist arrest.\"</p> <p>The three white middle-aged magistrates retire to decide Delroy's fate. A fine sheen of sweat forms on his lips. Sonia, who as a witness has had to wait outside court for most of the hearing, looks ashen. An hour passes. She talks about the old days, growing up in what seemed a more innocent world. Yes there was prejudice, as it was then called, when white women would shout at her to give up their seat for them. But she also remembers the way the local police popped round to her mum's house for a cup of tea and to gossip about the local crimes. In a strange way, she says, the world seemed more colour blind then.</p> <p>The Lindos' friends distract themselves with talk about Tottenham and Bernie Grant and New Labour, but the words soon peter out. For an hour we share a tiny bit of the ghastly uncertainty of the Lindos' daily life.</p> <p>On their return the magistrates look sombre. \"We find no evidence to prove you are guilty of these charges. You are free to go.\" Sonia's mother flings her arms in the air. She looks straight at the orthodox Jewish magistrate and cries out joyfully \"Thank you Jesus! Thank you!\" He looks bemused. Delroy and Sonia smile with relief. Charged 19 times, cleared 19 times.</p> <p>We ask the police about their treatment of the Lindos. Aren't they embarrassed about the number of times they have brought him to court? Is there a vendetta? Why was the officers' evidence so inconsistent despite the fact that they admitted sitting in the canteen and writing their notes together? Will there be an inquiry?</p> <p>A police spokesman says afterwards that they can't comment on the case because of the civil action taken by the Lindos. As for the issue of poor police evidence, the man from the Met says failings \"sometimes come down to something as simple as nerves\". If there is a problem with an officer's evidence \"it may be that a senior officer speaks to him about it\".</p> <p>A few days later we see the Lindos. Delroy says it's funny, he thought he'd be able to sleep better now, but there are so many things going through his head. Anyway, he says, \"last time we thought it was all over, and the time before that we thought it was all over. How do we know they won't come for us again?\" It will certainly be harder if they win their civil case. But, in the end, says Sonia, a financial settlement or an apology cannot erase the horror of the past 15 years.</p> <p>In the corner of the room, Chacelle is playing with friends. \"You know, the other day Chacelle was playing with her Cindy dolls and Action Men,\" says Sonia. \"She had some toy cars in the game too, and after a couple of minutes I realised that she was acting out Delroy's last arrest which she and Jerome watched from our car with the police surrounding them. I looked at her and I thought, 'My God this is really horrible.'\"</p> <p>Three weeks after the court case Delroy Lindo was stopped by the police again. His custody record stated that he had been arrested for \"sucking his teeth\" in the presence of a police officer. Delroy was held for five hours at Tottenham police station before being bailed, pending inquiries. After a complaint by Lee Jasper, race adviser for the Greater London Authority, the Metropolitan police told him there would be no charges and announced a full-scale inquiry into the alleged police harassment of the Lindo family.</p>",

But, in the end, says Sonia, a financial settlement or an apology cannot erase the horror of the past 15 years. In the corner of the room, Chacelle is playing with friends. \"You know, the other day Chacelle was playing with her Cindy dolls and Action Men,\" says Sonia. \"She had some toy cars in the game too, and after a couple of minutes I realised that she was acting out Delroy's last arrest which she and Jerome watched from our car with the police surrounding them. I looked at her and I thought, 'My God this is really horrible.'\" Three weeks after the court case Delroy Lindo was stopped by the police again. His custody record stated that he had been arrested for \"sucking his teeth\" in the presence of a police officer. Delroy was held for five hours at Tottenham police station before being bailed, pending inquiries. After a complaint by Lee Jasper, race adviser for the Greater London Authority, the Metropolitan police told him there would be no charges and announced a full-scale inquiry into the alleged police harassment of the Lindo family.",

He's a man who started late in his big screen career, but when it kicked in, he made people stand up and pay attention. His controlled performances have had a consistency and dynamic that not many people have matched. There are these words that are often thrown around - words like dignity, gravitas, intelligence, and I know all those words really piss them off. We're going to throw them out tonight and ask him why he's so sick of them. But the fact is they're accurate, I think the performances that he's given over the years give those films a moral centre. He does something that Spencer Tracey used to do - make you believe that against a very bleak backdrop something good can come out of terrible circumstances. So give a very big warm welcome to Morgan Freeman tonight because he's come in specially for this event - he's flew in this morning, a little bit jet-lagged, a little tired, and then he's going away tomorrow. I think it's incredible that the NFT have managed to entice him to coming for this special event so I think, give him a warm welcome. Morgan Freeman.</p> <p><strong>Morgan Freeman</strong>: I was thinking backstage that I just have a couple of words to say and I'll be very brief: Thank you.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Thanks for coming in and thanks for coming in at such short notice.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Believe me, it's my pleasure.</p> <p> <strong>RJ:</strong> Obviously you truly believe in Under Suspicion, and you're prepared to support it in this way -</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Has it been a special experience for you?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Yes because I've only just recently formed a film company, y'know, and this represents our first feature. Let me tell you how difficult it is to make a movie - not to shoot it - but to get it. To go somewhere and say: 'I have this really terrific movie but I need some . . . money' - Good luck!</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> I think a lot of people think because you're Morgan Freeman and because Gene Hackman was involved it's easy for you to go and knock on someone's door and they throw millions of dollars at you. Is that bullshit?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Bullshit.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Yeah. It wasn't an easy project to sell either. It's a tough film. It was a pretty bleak message in that movie.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> It's a very strange thing, Richard, we have this little project, it takes two characters, primarily, it's a two-character piece, although we have four of us working. But raising the money for that is just difficult. Now let's say you've got an idea for $130m science fiction movie [and they say]: 'No problem, when do you want to go into production? When will you have the script? Here's the cheque. . .' </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Why is that? Is it because your film was a more difficult project to sell? </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I can't begin to tell you why. I think that the mogul business of people who make these decisions kind of understand that if you have a large budget, not the word blockbuster, but it's a large movie - it's got lots of mayhem and action and stuff like that. Your audience is going to be young and pretty much non-discriminating. They'll be there. Where as if you do something where you need a thinking audience then you don't have a guarantee. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> It's kind of sad though isn't it that films that are more provocative, that ask more of an audience, they really are on the back foot these days. The big Friday night flick is really kicking smaller films out of place. . .</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> You want me to tell you something fantastic?</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Please.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Everywhere I go, everywhere I go, everywhere I go. People say, 'Love your movies. Shawshank Redemption' or they say 'Shooshunk' or 'Shankshout - Best movie I ever saw.' It opened the same year that Dumb and Dumber opened. It made $35m at the box office - domestic. Dumb and Dumber made $110m. Duu-uh.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> That doesn't dampen your enthusiasm for the industry and what you do?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Well, no. I am not in it to make money [accompanied by wicked grin to the audience]. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> I think you're having me on Morgan.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> No, seriously. The reason actors, artists, writers have agents is because we'll do it for nothing. That's a basic fact - you gotta do it. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Well, you did Under Suspicion for nothing. </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Pretty much, but I was paying me, so. . .</p> <p> <strong>RJ:</strong> Why did you come into movies relatively late?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I got sidetracked I think, by reality. I started out in. . . I went to Hollywood straight away. I got a good running start towards 'The Wall' - get down, not going to let anything stop me - but the wall was brick. So when I bounced, I bounced all the way to New York and got onto the stage and stayed there.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Which was probably a blessing in disguise.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Yeah. Absolutely. No question about it. Back in the 70s when the black exploitation period started, all the New York actors were going to Hollywood, starring in it, making $40,000. I said to my agent whose name was Jeff Hunter, picked me up from the first stage play I did in New York. I said, \"Everybody's going out there and they're working. I'm sitting here languishing. I should go - don't you think I should go out to Hollywood?\" \"I don't think so,\" he said, \"When they want you, they'll send for you.\" It worked. Though they didn't want me for a long time. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Do you feel good about skipping that whole period, that black exploitation period? That you didn't get involved?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> We were talking about blessings in disguise weren't we? </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Yeah. It's kind of weird that they've been reassessed - a lot of those films have got a strange hip-ness about them. But for the most part they're pretty terrible films aren't they?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> For the most part, yeah. I mean you had Shaft and you had Cotton Comes to Harlem and everything else was sort of sort of.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Yeah. I mean, what was that brick wall that bounced you back. What was it? Was it because you were a young black actor do you think? </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Well, 'cause I was a young actor - black, white or otherwise, you keep running at that wall in Hollywood, everyone's going to hit it, sooner or later. Most of us are going to hit at first shot. You get out there and you don't know anything or anybody and anybody you ask in Hollywood \"What do you do?\" it's \"I'm at actor. Just waiting tables or pumping gas or delivering mail until my shot comes, y'know\" - so that's what that's about.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Let's talk about your stage career - because that's been very important to you, hasn't it?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> That's, yeah, that's what I was doing from childhood. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> What kind of work were you doing when you went back to New York?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Everything. I did Brecht, Shakespeare, lots of new plays, and when I was coming along, which was in the late 60s, 70s, 80s - all the way up to the last play I did, which was in 1990 - I did a lot of - well we had Off-Broadway, when we started out and Dungeon. Anybody needin' me to explain Dungeon? No? We're okay. And then Dungeon had to step up because the prices got to be so much that we had Broadway, Off-Broadway, Dungeon became Off-Off-Broadway and then we had another Dungeon. So that was my career as it were. You go back and forth. You're on Broadway this year, maybe you had a successful, I was - I had to take a photograph of the first time my name (whispers) Morgan Freeman, was above the title on Broadway in New York City. Let me tell you what a moment it was for this young guy. And the play lasted about four . . . days. So of course, you're back to Dungeon. That's the way it goes in New York.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Yeah, but just working makes you obviously keep your nose to the grind. </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> You would work, you would do it. If someone pays you - great, I get busfare to get to the theatre! </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> What was the worst role you did, you think? What was the lowest moment during that period?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Well, I don't know about low moments, but I know the worst role I did was that play on Broadway. It was a three character play - would-be comedy - and I think the funniest thing about it was the one night the lead actor just completely forgot every line. It was one of those situations where you can't help - you can't throw him a line, you can't suggest a way for him to get out of it, you can't do anything. It's his problem. The audience now begins to know that it's his problem. You hear that, what they call a titter, running through a crowd here - that's what you were doing, sort of tittering. That begins to grow as this actor struggles to find out where he's supposed to be. Then we just closed the curtain.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> You were the lead in that weren't you?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I was not, no.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> The first movie that made an impression - what one was that do you think?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> The first movie that I did?</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> No, the first movie that made an impression.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> On me?</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Yeah, no - that got you noticed -</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> The first one I saw!</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> The first one you did, I think.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> The first one I did that made an impression on anybody - that's what you're asking me? Richard would you be clear?</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Okay, I think that is one all.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> It was a movie called Street Smart with Christopher Reeve and Kathy Baker. I played the pimp. My favourite role. No seriously, I think it's probably the best I ever did because when I look at it, I see a side of my character that isn't out there - it's not walking out in the open, but it's very definite. I had a great time.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> You were Oscar-nominated for that role, weren't you?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Say that a little louder?</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> I think you were Oscar-nominated for that role, were you not? </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> (Loudly) That was my FIRST Oscar nomination.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> It's strange because so many people have a very distinct impression of you, and it's not as a pimp is it?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> No. I'm this noble, wise, dignified. . .</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Gravitas. . . does that piss you off?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> No it doesn't piss me off but you know all my life in the theatre I've really not meant to get pigeon-holed - not to get bracketed so that my roles were chosen for me. Now I've become and I'm going to ask forgiveness, but I've sort of become the Henry Fonda. . . you know what I mean though, right? I played a bad guy in a movie and they showed it to an audience - and we're letting an audience tell us what to do now - y'know, and the audience said, 'Well, I don't want him - Morgan can't die!' And I was a thief. 'He should get some money'. So that's a dilemma. It's a real dilemma.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> And that was Hard Rain. You changed the ending right?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Yeah, I'm telling you - we went back into the studio and re-shot it so that I didn't die and I did get some money. Did any of you see this movie? Don't, just don't. Well anyway, this is the case, you know I'm right - that in any of these movies I'm seen. . .</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Yeah. Let's talk about a couple of other films. Let's talk about Clean and Sober - what's your memory of that movie?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Clean and Sober was the first movie I got to do a year after I got Street Smart - an Oscar nomination. People said: \"Well that's it man, you're off and running now - scripts be coming hot and heavy.\" Well they weren't. Glenn Caron hired me. He loved what I did and he hired me to play this drug counsellor. About this guy, a coke addict who was trying to clean up in a - what do you call these places? - a detox centre and the frictional relationship that develops in there. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> That was with Michael Keaton?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> With Michael Keaton and Kathy Baker again. Fun.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Did you enjoy that experience?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I enjoyed that experience. I had played a junkie, once, in a TV movie, actually but I didn't really know. . . but I had a friend who was a counsellor, he was a counsellor and he'd been one. I would try anything, except some things. I would not try heroin just to find out what the high was like. I was scared to death to do that. I would go to my friend and say, 'Alright now, tell me this. What happens when you first shoot up, when that jolt hits you - what's the first thing that happens?' And he said, 'That's where the nod is.' Uh, okay fine. 'It depends on how much you get as to how deep the nod is and as it wears off you start to get antsier and antsier and antsier; waiting, how are you going to get the next hit.' So I knew what I was doing in terms of playing the character. I also knew where to address it from in terms of the counsellor. That sort of no-mercy attitude that you have to have. Because no one is going to kick the habit for you - you're going to do it, or you're not going to do it. Plain and simple.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Yeah, he was a tough-ass guy wasn't he? And he had some hair-do. </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Well you know, I'm an actor - so I can change my hair if I want to.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Now this is the time when a different kind of role started to appear. This is the period of Driving Miss Daisy and Glory - when we start to see the other Morgan Freeman emerge. </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Yeah I think the big mistake was Driving Miss Daisy, actually. <strong>[<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan1.RA\">soundclip1</a>]</strong></p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> In what sense?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Well, the character caught on - this wise, old, dignified, black man that once people get an iconic - [to audience] can I use that term? You know what I mean, I'm makin' up words as I goin' and you can't always communicate with made-up words, so if I lose you, you gotta stand up and say what the hell are you talking about? But some characters become sort of bracketed, identifiable - identified - you and him. People come up and say: 'I just. . .' and cry and stuff and everywhere you go they're going to expect some aspect of that character out of you and if you disappoint them too many times. . . am I right?</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> How do you deal with that? How do you shake that off?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I haven't shaken it off. I told you they turned a whole movie around for that one reason. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Did that movie change your career?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Change my career? Everything changes my career - by change it means keeps going, so -</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Did it make it more financially remunerative - were you offered better roles, more money?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> You're never offered more money - you have to beg for more money. Well I got my second ACADEMY AWARD nomination there, which you didn't mention. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Well, I was pretty sure you might have mentioned it. Do you remember it fondly, the film?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I remember every film I did fondly, except maybe, two.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> One of them we're aware of which is uh. . . and the other will remain a secret.</p> <p> <strong>MF:</strong> It has to.</p> <p> <strong>RJ:</strong> What about Glory? Let's talk about Ed Zwick's show.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Glory came about, I was asked to do it. Ed Zwick and Freddie Fields, Freddie was the producer and Ed was the director. So we have this civil war movie - and I said: \"Oh I know about these people and this is such a great, great, great idea and I am so happy that you want me to be involved. I know that song, the language.\" And so we put this movie together and we went to Savannah, Georgia and for three weeks we rehearsed it and we wrote it. It was framed around a war without fleshed-out characters. We had character skeletons - so each actor got to actually put the meat on the bones of his character and it was a great experience. You see a lot of stuff in Glory that we actually sat down and improvised and then wrote down.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Do you feel a different kind of emotion when you're involved in a film like that - that has actually has a resonance, has some real meaning?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I think so, well for me, Glory is a film that I am absolutely most proud of as a work. It did everything I think a movie can do: it entertains; it instructs; it says something about the human spirit and vision; it covers a wide spectrum of positive things that we have the opportunity or the mandate to do as people who can influence large numbers of people who are thinking.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> But you weren't Oscar-nominated for that one, were you?. . . Don't look at me like that!</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Is this going to be an adversarial affair? No, but DENZEL though, won an Academy Award!</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> You've always made a pretty strong point about transcending colour and the characters you played, certainly later in your career, they could be from, anywhere - really, characters like Somerset, and the character in Kiss the Girls, I mean it doesn't matter, right - but those movies, it kind of did matter. Were you still, at that point in time, regarded as a black actor who's put in roles which were. . .</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I am going to stop here a moment and try to be intelligent. <strong>[<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan2.RA\">soundclip2</a>]</strong> You're never going to get away from being a black actor or a Chinese actor or an Asian actor or whatever your ethnicity might be - but Hollywood, or I should say the industry itself, is keeping up with the fact that we now have jet airplanes and the internet and all that - so we're tending to see not in these groupings. But more cohesive, more homogeneous - can I use that word? And so I try to exploit that fact, that I don't want to walk around, y'know - I don't have to say I'm black, in other words, do I? </p> <p> <strong>RJ:</strong> This brings us on to Amistad.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Aa-miiss-taad. Another one of those moments when your heart goes pitter patter because I can never explain to you what it's like when the phone goes and someone says, 'It's for you, it's Steven Spielberg'. This has happened to me on a number of occasions, but it still drops me and it's like - oomph. The first time it happened was in 1978 and it was Jos\u00e9 Ferrer. This man I idolise. I saw Cyrano de Bergerac and he played Cyrano and I thought I would never see the better. He called me on the telephone: 'Morgan, this is Jos\u00e9 Ferrer'. So it's Steven Spielberg on the phone: 'I have this wonderful project, I'm going to messenger the script over to you. There are two characters in there and I want you to consider.' It was Amistad. I knew the story of the Amistad, but nobody had ever actually sat down and done a movie about this incident and I was just, again - number one I can't believe the luck, having the sheer luck at having someone consider me for this wonderful idea. I really need to knock wood, because part of my career, a large part of my career has been enormous amounts of great good luck. Someone calls me up and says: 'We have this great project, we thought of you'. Shawshank Redemption, Se7en, Amistad, Unforgiven. . .</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> It makes such sense though from their point of view - I mean casting you in that role in Amistad makes a lot of sense, I can't think of anyone else taking that role.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Of course it makes sense! </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> They told me to say that, I might add.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Well done, I must say. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> We've been rehearsing that one all day. . . What was he like to work with, Spielberg?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> He's exciting, that's what he's like to work with. He knows precisely what he's doing, he's attentive, he's so knowledgeable, he's quick and if you've got an idea, he's nothing but ears. If you want to say something, you have his total attention. He's all he's cracked up to be.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> What do you think he brought to that story?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Himself. His belief, his fervour. . . he brought Steven Spielberg and all of him came with him, I think.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> And what about the finished film? What did you think when you sat back and watched that?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Well, I loved the film. I really did. I had a moment of err, during the killings. I thought that was a little over-wrought. But he wanted to make a point and I understood that. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> He tends to do that with a lot of his work, doesn't he? He wants to make a point so he manipulates it and. . .</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> But that's what you do when you're a storyteller.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> But he kind of unashamedly emotional in that way, isn't he - he wants to make an audience feel emotion, he wants to manipulate those emotions out of them. Is that a bad thing?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> No, it can't possibly be a bad thing, that's what any storyteller wants to do, I mean, you want to tell the story, you're telling it for a purpose, you want to do something to your audience, particularly if you're Steven Spielberg, that's why he's Steven Spielberg. When I walk out of a Steven Spielberg movie, something has happened to me. When I saw Close Encounters, my wife and I jumped into the car and drove out into the country where there were no lights so we could look up and see. . . y'know. <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,344714,00.html\">To next page</a></p> <p> <strong>Sound clips</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan1.RA\">\"The big mistake was Driving Miss Daisy\"</a> (2mins 06) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan2.RA\">\"You're never going to get away from being a black actor\"</a> (1 min) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan3.RA\">\"Method is a misnomer\"</a> (41 seconds) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan4.RA\">On Somerset in Se7en</a> (1min 19) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan5.RA\">On working with Eastwood in Unforgiven</a> (1min 14) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan6.RA\">\"On screen I see me through the audience\"</a> (1min 19) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan7.RA\">\"The problem with the Oscars is that if you don't win, you lose\"</a> (34 seconds) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan8.RA\">\"I do everything well, I mean, I'm an actor\"</a> (51 seconds)</p>",

Morgan Freeman: I was thinking backstage that I just have a couple of words to say and I'll be very brief: Thank you. RJ: Thanks for coming in and thanks for coming in at such short notice. MF: Believe me, it's my pleasure. RJ: Obviously you truly believe in Under Suspicion, and you're prepared to support it in this way - MF: Yes. RJ: Has it been a special experience for you? MF: Yes because I've only just recently formed a film company, y'know, and this represents our first feature. Let me tell you how difficult it is to make a movie - not to shoot it - but to get it. To go somewhere and say: 'I have this really terrific movie but I need some . . . money' - Good luck! RJ: I think a lot of people think because you're Morgan Freeman and because Gene Hackman was involved it's easy for you to go and knock on someone's door and they throw millions of dollars at you. Is that bullshit? MF: Bullshit. RJ: Yeah. It wasn't an easy project to sell either. It's a tough film. It was a pretty bleak message in that movie. MF: It's a very strange thing, Richard, we have this little project, it takes two characters, primarily, it's a two-character piece, although we have four of us working. But raising the money for that is just difficult. Now let's say you've got an idea for $130m science fiction movie [and they say]: 'No problem, when do you want to go into production? When will you have the script? Here's the cheque. . .' RJ: Why is that? Is it because your film was a more difficult project to sell? MF: I can't begin to tell you why. I think that the mogul business of people who make these decisions kind of understand that if you have a large budget, not the word blockbuster, but it's a large movie - it's got lots of mayhem and action and stuff like that. Your audience is going to be young and pretty much non-discriminating. They'll be there. Where as if you do something where you need a thinking audience then you don't have a guarantee. RJ: It's kind of sad though isn't it that films that are more provocative, that ask more of an audience, they really are on the back foot these days. The big Friday night flick is really kicking smaller films out of place. . . MF: You want me to tell you something fantastic? RJ: Please. MF: Everywhere I go, everywhere I go, everywhere I go. People say, 'Love your movies. Shawshank Redemption' or they say 'Shooshunk' or 'Shankshout - Best movie I ever saw.' It opened the same year that Dumb and Dumber opened. It made $35m at the box office - domestic. Dumb and Dumber made $110m. Duu-uh. RJ: That doesn't dampen your enthusiasm for the industry and what you do? MF: Well, no. I am not in it to make money [accompanied by wicked grin to the audience]. RJ: I think you're having me on Morgan. MF: No, seriously. The reason actors, artists, writers have agents is because we'll do it for nothing. That's a basic fact - you gotta do it. RJ: Well, you did Under Suspicion for nothing. MF: Pretty much, but I was paying me, so. . . RJ: Why did you come into movies relatively late? MF: I got sidetracked I think, by reality. I started out in. . . I went to Hollywood straight away. I got a good running start towards 'The Wall' - get down, not going to let anything stop me - but the wall was brick. So when I bounced, I bounced all the way to New York and got onto the stage and stayed there. RJ: Which was probably a blessing in disguise. MF: Yeah. Absolutely. No question about it. Back in the 70s when the black exploitation period started, all the New York actors were going to Hollywood, starring in it, making $40,000. I said to my agent whose name was Jeff Hunter, picked me up from the first stage play I did in New York. I said, \"Everybody's going out there and they're working. I'm sitting here languishing. I should go - don't you think I should go out to Hollywood?\" \"I don't think so,\" he said, \"When they want you, they'll send for you.\" It worked. Though they didn't want me for a long time. RJ: Do you feel good about skipping that whole period, that black exploitation period? That you didn't get involved? MF: We were talking about blessings in disguise weren't we? RJ: Yeah. It's kind of weird that they've been reassessed - a lot of those films have got a strange hip-ness about them. But for the most part they're pretty terrible films aren't they? MF: For the most part, yeah. I mean you had Shaft and you had Cotton Comes to Harlem and everything else was sort of sort of. RJ: Yeah. I mean, what was that brick wall that bounced you back. What was it? Was it because you were a young black actor do you think? MF: Well, 'cause I was a young actor - black, white or otherwise, you keep running at that wall in Hollywood, everyone's going to hit it, sooner or later. Most of us are going to hit at first shot. You get out there and you don't know anything or anybody and anybody you ask in Hollywood \"What do you do?\" it's \"I'm at actor. Just waiting tables or pumping gas or delivering mail until my shot comes, y'know\" - so that's what that's about. RJ: Let's talk about your stage career - because that's been very important to you, hasn't it? MF: That's, yeah, that's what I was doing from childhood. RJ: What kind of work were you doing when you went back to New York? MF: Everything. I did Brecht, Shakespeare, lots of new plays, and when I was coming along, which was in the late 60s, 70s, 80s - all the way up to the last play I did, which was in 1990 - I did a lot of - well we had Off-Broadway, when we started out and Dungeon. Anybody needin' me to explain Dungeon? No? We're okay. And then Dungeon had to step up because the prices got to be so much that we had Broadway, Off-Broadway, Dungeon became Off-Off-Broadway and then we had another Dungeon. So that was my career as it were. You go back and forth. You're on Broadway this year, maybe you had a successful, I was - I had to take a photograph of the first time my name (whispers) Morgan Freeman, was above the title on Broadway in New York City. Let me tell you what a moment it was for this young guy. And the play lasted about four . . . days. So of course, you're back to Dungeon. That's the way it goes in New York. RJ: Yeah, but just working makes you obviously keep your nose to the grind. MF: You would work, you would do it. If someone pays you - great, I get busfare to get to the theatre! RJ: What was the worst role you did, you think? What was the lowest moment during that period? MF: Well, I don't know about low moments, but I know the worst role I did was that play on Broadway. It was a three character play - would-be comedy - and I think the funniest thing about it was the one night the lead actor just completely forgot every line. It was one of those situations where you can't help - you can't throw him a line, you can't suggest a way for him to get out of it, you can't do anything. It's his problem. The audience now begins to know that it's his problem. You hear that, what they call a titter, running through a crowd here - that's what you were doing, sort of tittering. That begins to grow as this actor struggles to find out where he's supposed to be. Then we just closed the curtain. RJ: You were the lead in that weren't you? MF: I was not, no. RJ: The first movie that made an impression - what one was that do you think? MF: The first movie that I did? RJ: No, the first movie that made an impression. MF: On me? RJ: Yeah, no - that got you noticed - MF: The first one I saw! RJ: The first one you did, I think. MF: The first one I did that made an impression on anybody - that's what you're asking me? Richard would you be clear? RJ: Okay, I think that is one all. MF: It was a movie called Street Smart with Christopher Reeve and Kathy Baker. I played the pimp. My favourite role. No seriously, I think it's probably the best I ever did because when I look at it, I see a side of my character that isn't out there - it's not walking out in the open, but it's very definite. I had a great time. RJ: You were Oscar-nominated for that role, weren't you? MF: Say that a little louder? RJ: I think you were Oscar-nominated for that role, were you not? MF: (Loudly) That was my FIRST Oscar nomination. RJ: It's strange because so many people have a very distinct impression of you, and it's not as a pimp is it? MF: No. I'm this noble, wise, dignified. . . RJ: Gravitas. . . does that piss you off? MF: No it doesn't piss me off but you know all my life in the theatre I've really not meant to get pigeon-holed - not to get bracketed so that my roles were chosen for me. Now I've become and I'm going to ask forgiveness, but I've sort of become the Henry Fonda. . . you know what I mean though, right? I played a bad guy in a movie and they showed it to an audience - and we're letting an audience tell us what to do now - y'know, and the audience said, 'Well, I don't want him - Morgan can't die!' And I was a thief. 'He should get some money'. So that's a dilemma. It's a real dilemma. RJ: And that was Hard Rain. You changed the ending right? MF: Yeah, I'm telling you - we went back into the studio and re-shot it so that I didn't die and I did get some money. Did any of you see this movie? Don't, just don't. Well anyway, this is the case, you know I'm right - that in any of these movies I'm seen. . . RJ: Yeah. Let's talk about a couple of other films. Let's talk about Clean and Sober - what's your memory of that movie? MF: Clean and Sober was the first movie I got to do a year after I got Street Smart - an Oscar nomination. People said: \"Well that's it man, you're off and running now - scripts be coming hot and heavy.\" Well they weren't. Glenn Caron hired me. He loved what I did and he hired me to play this drug counsellor. About this guy, a coke addict who was trying to clean up in a - what do you call these places? - a detox centre and the frictional relationship that develops in there. RJ: That was with Michael Keaton? MF: With Michael Keaton and Kathy Baker again. Fun. RJ: Did you enjoy that experience? MF: I enjoyed that experience. I had played a junkie, once, in a TV movie, actually but I didn't really know. . . but I had a friend who was a counsellor, he was a counsellor and he'd been one. I would try anything, except some things. I would not try heroin just to find out what the high was like. I was scared to death to do that. I would go to my friend and say, 'Alright now, tell me this. What happens when you first shoot up, when that jolt hits you - what's the first thing that happens?' And he said, 'That's where the nod is.' Uh, okay fine. 'It depends on how much you get as to how deep the nod is and as it wears off you start to get antsier and antsier and antsier; waiting, how are you going to get the next hit.' So I knew what I was doing in terms of playing the character. I also knew where to address it from in terms of the counsellor. That sort of no-mercy attitude that you have to have. Because no one is going to kick the habit for you - you're going to do it, or you're not going to do it. Plain and simple. RJ: Yeah, he was a tough-ass guy wasn't he? And he had some hair-do. MF: Well you know, I'm an actor - so I can change my hair if I want to. RJ: Now this is the time when a different kind of role started to appear. This is the period of Driving Miss Daisy and Glory - when we start to see the other Morgan Freeman emerge. MF: Yeah I think the big mistake was Driving Miss Daisy, actually. [soundclip1] RJ: In what sense? MF: Well, the character caught on - this wise, old, dignified, black man that once people get an iconic - [to audience] can I use that term? You know what I mean, I'm makin' up words as I goin' and you can't always communicate with made-up words, so if I lose you, you gotta stand up and say what the hell are you talking about? But some characters become sort of bracketed, identifiable - identified - you and him. People come up and say: 'I just. . .' and cry and stuff and everywhere you go they're going to expect some aspect of that character out of you and if you disappoint them too many times. . . am I right? RJ: How do you deal with that? How do you shake that off? MF: I haven't shaken it off. I told you they turned a whole movie around for that one reason. RJ: Did that movie change your career? MF: Change my career? Everything changes my career - by change it means keeps going, so - RJ: Did it make it more financially remunerative - were you offered better roles, more money? MF: You're never offered more money - you have to beg for more money. Well I got my second ACADEMY AWARD nomination there, which you didn't mention. RJ: Well, I was pretty sure you might have mentioned it. Do you remember it fondly, the film? MF: I remember every film I did fondly, except maybe, two. RJ: One of them we're aware of which is uh. . . and the other will remain a secret. MF: It has to. RJ: What about Glory? Let's talk about Ed Zwick's show. MF: Glory came about, I was asked to do it. Ed Zwick and Freddie Fields, Freddie was the producer and Ed was the director. So we have this civil war movie - and I said: \"Oh I know about these people and this is such a great, great, great idea and I am so happy that you want me to be involved. I know that song, the language.\" And so we put this movie together and we went to Savannah, Georgia and for three weeks we rehearsed it and we wrote it. It was framed around a war without fleshed-out characters. We had character skeletons - so each actor got to actually put the meat on the bones of his character and it was a great experience. You see a lot of stuff in Glory that we actually sat down and improvised and then wrote down. RJ: Do you feel a different kind of emotion when you're involved in a film like that - that has actually has a resonance, has some real meaning? MF: I think so, well for me, Glory is a film that I am absolutely most proud of as a work. It did everything I think a movie can do: it entertains; it instructs; it says something about the human spirit and vision; it covers a wide spectrum of positive things that we have the opportunity or the mandate to do as people who can influence large numbers of people who are thinking. RJ: But you weren't Oscar-nominated for that one, were you?. . . Don't look at me like that! MF: Is this going to be an adversarial affair? No, but DENZEL though, won an Academy Award! RJ: You've always made a pretty strong point about transcending colour and the characters you played, certainly later in your career, they could be from, anywhere - really, characters like Somerset, and the character in Kiss the Girls, I mean it doesn't matter, right - but those movies, it kind of did matter. Were you still, at that point in time, regarded as a black actor who's put in roles which were. . . MF: I am going to stop here a moment and try to be intelligent. [soundclip2] You're never going to get away from being a black actor or a Chinese actor or an Asian actor or whatever your ethnicity might be - but Hollywood, or I should say the industry itself, is keeping up with the fact that we now have jet airplanes and the internet and all that - so we're tending to see not in these groupings. But more cohesive, more homogeneous - can I use that word? And so I try to exploit that fact, that I don't want to walk around, y'know - I don't have to say I'm black, in other words, do I? RJ: This brings us on to Amistad. MF: Aa-miiss-taad. Another one of those moments when your heart goes pitter patter because I can never explain to you what it's like when the phone goes and someone says, 'It's for you, it's Steven Spielberg'. This has happened to me on a number of occasions, but it still drops me and it's like - oomph. The first time it happened was in 1978 and it was Jos\u00e9 Ferrer. This man I idolise. I saw Cyrano de Bergerac and he played Cyrano and I thought I would never see the better. He called me on the telephone: 'Morgan, this is Jos\u00e9 Ferrer'. So it's Steven Spielberg on the phone: 'I have this wonderful project, I'm going to messenger the script over to you. There are two characters in there and I want you to consider.' It was Amistad. I knew the story of the Amistad, but nobody had ever actually sat down and done a movie about this incident and I was just, again - number one I can't believe the luck, having the sheer luck at having someone consider me for this wonderful idea. I really need to knock wood, because part of my career, a large part of my career has been enormous amounts of great good luck. Someone calls me up and says: 'We have this great project, we thought of you'. Shawshank Redemption, Se7en, Amistad, Unforgiven. . . RJ: It makes such sense though from their point of view - I mean casting you in that role in Amistad makes a lot of sense, I can't think of anyone else taking that role. MF: Of course it makes sense! RJ: They told me to say that, I might add. MF: Well done, I must say. RJ: We've been rehearsing that one all day. . . What was he like to work with, Spielberg? MF: He's exciting, that's what he's like to work with. He knows precisely what he's doing, he's attentive, he's so knowledgeable, he's quick and if you've got an idea, he's nothing but ears. If you want to say something, you have his total attention. He's all he's cracked up to be. RJ: What do you think he brought to that story? MF: Himself. His belief, his fervour. . . he brought Steven Spielberg and all of him came with him, I think. RJ: And what about the finished film? What did you think when you sat back and watched that? MF: Well, I loved the film. I really did. I had a moment of err, during the killings. I thought that was a little over-wrought. But he wanted to make a point and I understood that. RJ: He tends to do that with a lot of his work, doesn't he? He wants to make a point so he manipulates it and. . . MF: But that's what you do when you're a storyteller. RJ: But he kind of unashamedly emotional in that way, isn't he - he wants to make an audience feel emotion, he wants to manipulate those emotions out of them. Is that a bad thing? MF: No, it can't possibly be a bad thing, that's what any storyteller wants to do, I mean, you want to tell the story, you're telling it for a purpose, you want to do something to your audience, particularly if you're Steven Spielberg, that's why he's Steven Spielberg. When I walk out of a Steven Spielberg movie, something has happened to me. When I saw Close Encounters, my wife and I jumped into the car and drove out into the country where there were no lights so we could look up and see. . . y'know.

      "body": "<p><strong>MERSEY-GO-ROUND</strong></p> <p>Walter Smith is to put his Everton charges through a brutal pre-season regime - demanding that every player knows the name of every other player in the squad. With the level of staff turnover at Goodison Park this summer, Smith's initiative has already earned the Toffees taskmaster the moniker \"the man with know names\". Dave Watson in particular is concerned, as he is still believed to be learning the names of the '97 squad.</p> <p>The latest player to contribute to the name crisis is Ghanaian international midfielder Alex Nyarko, who joined Everton today from Racing Club Lens for \u00a34.6m. He becomes Smith's third summer signing after the arrival of Steve Pistone and Alessandro Watson (\"Get down and give me 20!!\") earlier this month. Nyarko will require a work permit and, in a remarkably tedious press conference, Smith told the world: \"That process should take about two weeks but we do not expect any problems.\"</p> <p>Further adding to the confusion (he is a Geordie who plays for Scotland, after all) was Don Hutchison, who completed his \u00a32.5m move to Sunderland this afternoon. Peter Reid was effusive in his praise for the one-time Budweiser model, claiming: \"I've signed a quality player who really wants to wear a red and white shirt, and that's a priority for me as a manager.\" Even though red and white is so last summer.</p> <p>Meanwhile Don, who incidentally was wearing a plain white shirt, said: \"I'm delighted to be joining Sunderland. They are a team which has grown significantly over the last few years.\" The word \"growth\" presumably refers to their wage structure. \"With the Premiership's top goalscorer in Kevin Phillips, I'll be looking to create chances and bring more goals,\" he went on. \"There are a lot of quality players in the squad.\" Ah, but can he remember their names?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>YOU ONLY BET WHEN THEY'RE LOSING</strong></p> <p>It's the news hardened gamblers have been waiting for. Yes, that's right: thanks to improvements in gene technology you can now achieve the wizened and impoverished look without spending a lifetime in William Hill on a diet of Special Brew and roll-up cigarettes! Actually, you can't, but in principle it would be great. No, the real news is that the odds on Premiership managers getting the boot next season are out, and they make interesting reading. If looking at names followed by numbers constitutes reading that is.</p> <p>Top of the bookies' sacking hit-list is the new Bradford boss, Chris Hutchings, at 8-11 on. This decision is presumably based on the fact that they haven't heard of him, and he's got a big mullet (which are good enough reasons for the Fiver). Next up are John Gregory (6-4) and Bryan Robson (15-8) for reasons we can't possibly fathom. Not far behind, however, is a certain Gianluca Vialli (2-1) which suggests that those with a degree in turf accountancy don't expect Kuddly Ken Bates' temper to hold forever.</p> <p>At the safe end of the scale, as you might expect, lies the Imperial Lord Ferg, accompanied by naive managerial ingenue David O'Leary (both at 10-1). With memories of the Double fast receding, Arsene Wenger can only muster a measly 6-1 (which is roughly the ratio of foreigners to Englishmen at Highbury), while Harry Redknapp and Bobby Robson are rewarded for their attempts to buy British with thoroughly respectable odds of 5-1. George Graham, meanwhile, is at 5-2 - perhaps he'd better hold on to David Ginola after all.</p> <p>Full odds: 8-11 Chris Hutchings, 6-4 John Gregory, 15-8 Bryan Robson, Glenn Hoddle; 2-1 Jim Smith, Gianluca Vialli; 9-4 Peter Taylor, 5-2 George Burley, Alan Curbishley, George Graham, Walter Smith; 11-4 Gordon Strachan, 3-1 Joe Royle, 4-1 Gerard Houllier, 5-1 Harry Redknapp, Bobby Robson; 6-1 Peter Reid, Arsene Wenger; 10-1 Alex Ferguson, David O'Leary.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"If we weren't playing in this competition we might be having friendlies against the likes of Rochdale, Stevenage or Wycombe.

That much was made clear by the club today, after rumours doing the rounds on the internet (and 48 hours later, the papers) suggested that he was set for a \u00a340m move to AC Milan. United are, however, believed to be ready to sell David Beckham hair gel, tampon holders, paint brushes and curtain rails.</p> <p>\"We have had no contact from either Milan or Inter,\" said Money Martin Edwards today, referring to Milan's Becks bid and the other recent story linking Paul Scholes with a move to transfer nutters Internazionale (club motto: if it moves we'll buy it, then sell it on the next season for half the price). \"But in either case, it would be immaterial because they will not be leaving,\" he went on.</p> <p>With stories persisting that United are desperate to sign Javier Zanetti from Inter (cue standard quote from Argentine midfield ace: \"I would be honoured to be offered such an opportunity by Manchester United\"), United may yet do business with the Serie A club. A figure of \u00a310m is being bandied about, which makes Zanetti a third of the player Paul Scholes is, but the Italian giants may yet be persuaded to accept a Jordi Cruyff talc and delousing kit instead.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Arsene Wenger has denied that Ray Parlour is about to move to Sunderland in a \u00a35m deal. \"Ray Parlour is a talented, experienced midfielder and very much part of my plans,\" the Frenchman told the club's website. \"He is not for sale.\"</p> <p>Barcelona are ready to make another attempt to sign Emmanuel Petit, according to Planet Football.</p> <p>And Planet Football also reports that Lazio are set to agree another multi-million transfer deal, this time for Italian defender Fabio Cannavaro.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>The Manchester United chief executive, Martin Edwards, may step down on Monday, according to a report on the club's website.

Meanwhile Don, who incidentally was wearing a plain white shirt, said: \"I'm delighted to be joining Sunderland. They are a team which has grown significantly over the last few years.\" The word \"growth\" presumably refers to their wage structure. \"With the Premiership's top goalscorer in Kevin Phillips, I'll be looking to create chances and bring more goals,\" he went on. \"There are a lot of quality players in the squad.\" Ah, but can he remember their names? * * * * * * * * * * * * * YOU ONLY BET WHEN THEY'RE LOSING It's the news hardened gamblers have been waiting for. Yes, that's right: thanks to improvements in gene technology you can now achieve the wizened and impoverished look without spending a lifetime in William Hill on a diet of Special Brew and roll-up cigarettes! Actually, you can't, but in principle it would be great. No, the real news is that the odds on Premiership managers getting the boot next season are out, and they make interesting reading. If looking at names followed by numbers constitutes reading that is. Top of the bookies' sacking hit-list is the new Bradford boss, Chris Hutchings, at 8-11 on. This decision is presumably based on the fact that they haven't heard of him, and he's got a big mullet (which are good enough reasons for the Fiver). Next up are John Gregory (6-4) and Bryan Robson (15-8) for reasons we can't possibly fathom. Not far behind, however, is a certain Gianluca Vialli (2-1) which suggests that those with a degree in turf accountancy don't expect Kuddly Ken Bates' temper to hold forever. At the safe end of the scale, as you might expect, lies the Imperial Lord Ferg, accompanied by naive managerial ingenue David O'Leary (both at 10-1). With memories of the Double fast receding, Arsene Wenger can only muster a measly 6-1 (which is roughly the ratio of foreigners to Englishmen at Highbury), while Harry Redknapp and Bobby Robson are rewarded for their attempts to buy British with thoroughly respectable odds of 5-1. George Graham, meanwhile, is at 5-2 - perhaps he'd better hold on to David Ginola after all. Full odds: 8-11 Chris Hutchings, 6-4 John Gregory, 15-8 Bryan Robson, Glenn Hoddle; 2-1 Jim Smith, Gianluca Vialli; 9-4 Peter Taylor, 5-2 George Burley, Alan Curbishley, George Graham, Walter Smith; 11-4 Gordon Strachan, 3-1 Joe Royle, 4-1 Gerard Houllier, 5-1 Harry Redknapp, Bobby Robson; 6-1 Peter Reid, Arsene Wenger; 10-1 Alex Ferguson, David O'Leary. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"If we weren't playing in this competition we might be having friendlies against the likes of Rochdale, Stevenage or Wycombe. At least it has got a serious ring to it.\" Is this the first time anyone has talked up the Intertoto Cup? John Gregory in upbeat mood ahead of Aston Villa's clash with the mighty Dukla Pribram. * * * * * * * * * * * * * RED BARMY Manchester United will not be selling David Beckham. That much was made clear by the club today, after rumours doing the rounds on the internet (and 48 hours later, the papers) suggested that he was set for a \u00a340m move to AC Milan. United are, however, believed to be ready to sell David Beckham hair gel, tampon holders, paint brushes and curtain rails. \"We have had no contact from either Milan or Inter,\" said Money Martin Edwards today, referring to Milan's Becks bid and the other recent story linking Paul Scholes with a move to transfer nutters Internazionale (club motto: if it moves we'll buy it, then sell it on the next season for half the price). \"But in either case, it would be immaterial because they will not be leaving,\" he went on. With stories persisting that United are desperate to sign Javier Zanetti from Inter (cue standard quote from Argentine midfield ace: \"I would be honoured to be offered such an opportunity by Manchester United\"), United may yet do business with the Serie A club. A figure of \u00a310m is being bandied about, which makes Zanetti a third of the player Paul Scholes is, but the Italian giants may yet be persuaded to accept a Jordi Cruyff talc and delousing kit instead. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Arsene Wenger has denied that Ray Parlour is about to move to Sunderland in a \u00a35m deal. \"Ray Parlour is a talented, experienced midfielder and very much part of my plans,\" the Frenchman told the club's website. \"He is not for sale.\" Barcelona are ready to make another attempt to sign Emmanuel Petit, according to Planet Football. And Planet Football also reports that Lazio are set to agree another multi-million transfer deal, this time for Italian defender Fabio Cannavaro. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF The Manchester United chief executive, Martin Edwards, may step down on Monday, according to a report on the club's website. Edwards had been expected to leave in September, but the website cited \"various sources\" saying the move had been brought forward to allow his successor, Peter Kenyon, time to settle in before the start of the new season. Leeds United will open talks over the weekend on a new contract for Harry Kewell, according to the Elland Road chairman, Peter Ridsdale. Danny Griffin today made a \u00a3600,000 move from St Johnstone to Scottish Premier League rivals Dundee United after spurning the opportunity to go to Southampton. Mark Burchill says he may quit Celtic if he remains on the fringes of the first team. \"I'm going to be 20 soon and I really need to be playing all the time,\" he said. \"I love being here, but I have to be realistic as well.\" Giorgi Kinkladze is expected to miss a month of pre-season training with Derby as he needs a hernia operation. Brad Friedel has been left stranded in the United States after the Department for Education and Employment refused to renew his work permit. Bolton have signed striker Michael Ricketts, 21, from Walsall for an undisclosed fee. Cambridge United have signed Bradford City centre-back John Dreyer on a two-year contract. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Nada. Nowt. Nish. Nothing. Nonce.",

      "body": "<p>Stephin Merritt, the frontman of the Magnetic Fields, is supposed to be contemplating his recently released, critically adored masterwork 69 Love Songs, but instead he's gazing wantonly at a small white dog sniffing at the bushes that line London's Grand Union Canal. \"I dearly love my little chihuahua Irving,\" he confesses, \"and when I'm away from him, I'm suddenly very attracted towards small dogs. I want to have conversations with them and rub their bellies.\" It puts a bizarre new light on his songs about infidelity - not least Fido, Your Leash Is Too Long. </p> <p>He's nothing like you expect him to be, this man with the lugubrious, debonair baritone voice and most bewitching lyrics in pop. He's slight and tiny - barely over five foot - and seems to drag his deep voice up from his knees. Dressed in various shades of black, resting his feet on a rapidly growing mountain of cigarette stubs, the thirtysomething (he doesn't give an age) is a demanding conversationalist, pausing for several moments of intense thought before he says anything. The seriousness is tempered, however, with an urbane and entertaining wit, as a skip through 69 Love Songs attests. </p> <p>There's The Death of Ferdinand de Saussure, for example, during which Merritt pictures a self-styled \"great composer\" shooting the Swiss linguist in honour of Motown songwriters Holland-Dozier-Holland; and For We Are the King of the Boudoir, a flamboyant rococo flourish that promises \"One kiss from me and you'll see God\".</p> <p>Both of these might, understandably, have a lot of people stretching for the off button. But there's also the saucy gospel Kiss Me Like You Mean It, and a jaunty response to Irving Berlin (after whom Merritt's pooch is named) called A Pretty Girl Is Like..., which compares love to violent crime: \"If you do it wrong you could do time\". </p> <p>The album, a lot of which was written in a gay bar near Merritt's home in New York's East Village, covers every imaginable state of love, from an affair's early uncertainty through nights of emulating rabbits to the memory loss of absence. And, for all its cool acerbity, its songs about dancing and staying up late exude a headiness reminiscent of Katharine Hepburn/Cary Grant movies. </p> <p>\"I like the idea,\" Merritt muses, \"that there could be a 12-year-old whose first record purchase is 69 Love Songs, who would then judge all other records according to it. He will think that others must be brilliant for being able to put out albums of only 12 songs, but that all these other records are horribly missing in romance. He'll miss the lyrics about dancing in faded ballrooms among the chandeliers.\" </p> <p>If only someone would employ him to write songs for Britney and the Backstreet Boys, all youngsters could grow up on intelligent, funny, provocative lyrics and the charts would be a finer place. As it is, Merritt is employed as a music critic by Time Out magazine in New York. He's lived there since 1994; before that he travelled with his mother (he lived in 33 houses in his first 23 years) and briefly alighted in Boston, where he and the Magnetic Fields' drummer and manager Claudia Gonson both attended Harvard University. For Time Out, he writes about everything from the Folkways catalogue and the 50s humorous songwriter Tom Lehrer to the Spice Girls. </p> <p>\"I hear a little of everything,\" Merritt says of his work, \"and that makes me jaded in some way, but on the other hand I am very knowledgeable about what is being released and I know what I can do to sound unlike other people. At the moment that is to put out 69 Love Songs. You have to be pretty extreme if you don't want to be just like someone else.\" </p> <p>That isn't to say that his music sounds unlike anything ever released: on the contrary, references to music of the past litter Merritt's work. On 69 Love Songs he zooms between rock, jazz and blues, cabaret, synth pop and Swedish reggae. He honestly regrets not tackling rap, heavy metal and raunchy R&amp;B, \"styles that I'm not at all suited for doing\". Previous Magnetic Fields albums have seen Merritt deconstruct the country song (Charm of the Highway Strip), and he repeatedly returns to the Phil Spector sound. </p> <p>Equal parts music practitioner and theoretician, Merritt feels that, far from being reductive, such references are a vital component of pop. \"It would be great if somebody could do something new in music that didn't depend heavily on references to previous music, but it wouldn't be pop,\" he argues. \"Pop is reference to pop music: in the verse-chorus structure and the instruments, and in the phrasing and melodic traditions. What I'd like to do next is come up with something that really doesn't sound like anything else, and yet somehow is within the pop tradition. I won't be upset if I can't figure out how to do it. But it's a noble goal.\" </p> <p>One idea he's currently working on is music without drumbeats; another is a 60-person orchestra of modern instruments, such as theremins and Moogs. He's also considering taking accent lessons, so that he can adapt his voice without taking actual singing lessons, which he's never done. Merritt has been the Magnetic Fields' singer since 1991, when the band's first singer, Susan Anway, inexplicably decided to study dental sculpture. He still thinks that his voice is \"technically horrendous\", redeemed only by the fact that \"I can sing lower than anyone else in popular music\". </p> <p>Before he embarks on any of these ideas, however, he is sticking with love songs. The 69 just released were originally going to form a competitive revue show for drag queens - although, Merritt says, that plan only lasted five minutes - which their composer hoped would open doors into the world of writing musicals. He's taken the initiative, however, and is currently halfway through concocting a screen musical with the Magnetic Fields' accordionist Daniel Handler. \"It's called The Song From Venus,\" he reveals. \"An aphrodisiac record comes down from Venus and makes people fall in love, screwing up a lot of characters before it takes over the world.\" </p> <p>Hmmm. Might the taking-over-the-world part be erased from the final script? \"Oh no,\" Merritt frowns. \"It's a successful invasion from Venus in the form of a pretty love song.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The Magnetic Fields play Womad, Reading (0118-939 0930) on July 22, and Queen Elizabeth Hall, London SE1 (020-7960 4242) on July 25.</p>",

You mentioned Shawshank -</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Shemshonk. Shemsham.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Tell us about your relationship with Tim Robbins and how you bonded with him. In those lonely prison cells. </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Shawshank was one of those situations where I was first hired and they ran a whole bunch of possibilities past me: Who do you wanna work with? Tim Robbins. So it was me and Tim. He is another one of those actors, who, I think he is just transcendent in his work. When he got his teeth into something he is totally watchable. Absolutely engrossing, to me. And we, I think actors who have characters who they totally understand help each other understand even more and I think that was what was happening with us. The deeper we got, the more we shot, the more we understood each other. The bonding was just the normal character thing. Of course we're close friends now. It's a transcendent moment for us as actors that the movie comes out and becomes what it has become. One of the most watched, one of the most rented videos, I guess in the world. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> How does Frank Darabont stand up against the very eclectic bag of people you've worked with?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Frank. I have a problem with writer/directors, personal. I can't work well with both of them on the set, if both of them are giving instructions. Writers tend to be in love with what they wrote. You can't always translate the words into the meaning, sometimes the meaning is better served without the words, difficult to make a writer to try to understand that. It gets, sometimes, tense.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> He speaks very highly of you. He was in town recently!</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> And I think highly of him too - he directed that movie! I didn't direct the movie. He wrote it, he directed it, it's his movie, his mark and it's a great film. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> It connected you with people that movie, didn't it? </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Oh, absolutely.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> What do you think was the heartbeat of that movie that connected to people in such a general way?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> The development, the relationship of those two men. What happened at the end took everybody all the way through that movie. That he got out and he somehow remembered that there was help somewhere, I mean Red. And ultimately the two of them came together. Like old lovers. The rejoining of two people who cared a lot about each other. A lot of movie say they love that movie and I know why, because it's about love. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> You are drawn to a certain kind of actor aren't you? We've seen it tonight with Gene Hackman. Gene Hackman is of course, the star, but you don't think of him as a sort of star, you think of him as an actor. Is that something that you would like to be regarded as?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Oh yes, absolutely. I know for a fact, I know, that when you get the sobriquet, 'star', that label is put on you so that the audience will come to see you. You. An actor thinks the audience is coming to see what you're doing. Am I making sense there? In other words, I don't like to think of myself as a personality. I can't wear a nose ring, dreadlocks, or any of that - because my next character has to be able to fit what's on the page - rather than have the page fit what I'm walking around with. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> I think that's very well explained. </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Phew.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> I think even worthy of an Oscar nomination, I think. </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> No one mentioned that I got my third Oscar nomination for Shawshank. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> We did skip by that didn't we? </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Oh, it's alright, it's okay. </p> <p> <strong>RJ:</strong> Hackman. Let's get a few words on Hackman, because he's a tour de force, isn't he?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> This is another one of those situations where, I don't know, I'm a child of the movies, I grew up going to the movies. Every day I could get the 12 cents together, eventually it was 25 cents, and now it's $10 - and you don't even get a cartoon. So I idolise movie actors, both sexes. Hackman is one of those people. He's a movie actor, boy he's an actor and every time I go see him I just marvel at him. I just. . . When I go to movies, not only am I being entertained, but I am also being trained as an actor because I am shameless in my thievery. If I can make it work for me and you did it, well, sue me. You're not going to be able to look like anyone else, no matter how hard you try, unless you're a mimic, then you're not acting, you're just mimicking. You can't go on being John Wayne, that's John Wayne. So you're not going to steal from John Wayne. I'm not going to steal from John Wayne and you're not going to come back and say 'Didn't you get that from the circus?' You know. But he is one of those people who instructs me, whom I look up to - whom I think is one of the masters of his craft that I am so enamoured of. So the opportunity and the, there's another word that means what happens when someone says you're good enough to do this, what is it? But if Gene says 'Morgan, here's a piece that I would like us to do' I mean, it's Gene Hackman. You know. You may think it's different, but that's me - that's how I react to having the opportunity to work with these people I think so highly of. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> When you're that close to them and you're working that closely with them, what is it you appropriate from them?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I am not sure I can answer all of that because what is it that makes a Picasso a Picasso - what is it that makes Gene Hackman the actor he is? Wherever he goes with what he does, he totally focused on what he's doing. He's not commenting on it, he's not grandstanding with it, he's just focusing on being the deepest and best he can be. And that helps you be the deepest and the best you can be. An actor who's going to run towards the cliff, hold his nose and jump - just hold hands and do it. What was that from? Quick.</p> <p>Audience member: Butch Cassidy.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> You are so bright.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> So he's got that instinctive thing?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Yes, instinct is the right word, it's almost automatic. You learn technique, but it's ingrained - what it is - how it is, is what you learn.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> I get the feeling that you also share with him the belief that if it's not on the page you're not going to make it happen on the screen. It needs to be fundamentally there.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Yes, it has to be fundamentally there. I think that the great unsung heroes of movies are the writers - you look at the movie credits and you might see eight writers from an idea - but if it's not on the page, you're not likely to get it, not so that your audience likes it. Every hole, every place where you've patched it, every mis-step, every plot contrivance. And the hardest thing to do is to tell people who are sitting in some of these front offices, 'Audiences think, stupid. You can trust that they think.' A lot of people think that you've got to be spoon fed every little want, every little thing. I don't think that either. You know why I don't think that? Because I am in the audience. I go to movies too.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> And you want to believe it. You want to sit there and believe it.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Absolutely. Almost TEN DOLLARS!</p> <p> <strong>RJ:</strong> You've never gone to the extreme to the method acting. You said earlier in your career you investigated certain technical things, but beyond that, I know when you were working with Brad Pitt, in Se7en, that Brad liked to take it as far as he could in taking up everything in that kind of method-y way -</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Listen, method is a misnomer. <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan3.RA\">sound clip 3</a> ]</strong> No one is really a method actor, everyone has their way of going about it, preparing for it, but method is preparation, it's what you do to prepare. So my method is to read the script. Some actors' method is to read the script a hundred times and in the doing of it, to immerse themselves in as much of the reality as possible. Me, I believe strictly in acting. If I am out of breath, I'm out of breath. I ain't running nowhere. </p> <p> <strong>RJ:</strong> So how quickly did you connect with Somerset then when you read Se7en?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I put the script down and I was ready to go on the set. All you need when you know it, when you read it and you say 'Oooh, oooh. Find me a costume designer, quick. 'Cause I need this, this, this and this.' Costume designer comes along and says, 'Y'know I was thinking about this, this, this and a hat.' (makes big smooching sound) We're in, we're homefree. Simple. It isn't rocket science. Well, it is, but we make it up as we go.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Was it all on the page then?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Every line, every nuance. Everything was on the page except the manner in which the director wanted to shoot it and the lighting.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> And that is where the boat was pushed out, right? You tried to take a crime thriller and do something new with it? Did you achieve that?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I think he did it in spades. This young guy, this David Fincher, he comes out of the Northern Californian school system but he was like, a drop-out. He started making music videos, so he is very computer literate, graphic oriented, knows all about film. He wanted to shoot this movie dark, he wanted it dark, so he was going to do a reclamation process, where you would take all of the silver nitrate that comes out of the wash when you develop the film, run it back through again, which takes the shaded, the dark parts of the movie and makes it darker. That just dampens down the entire movie. The light, the colours, makes it deeper. That is what he did. The problem with the process is that in the newer theatres, they have a different lighting system than the old arc light, that were in the reel to reels. So in those the light you have to pump it way up in order to get the light, because if you don't - people really can't see. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> So he hadn't thought it through, had he?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Well, he'd thought it through, but we want to look at it in the big theatres in Hollywood, we're not going to go to the art houses.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Did you feel that you were involved in a special project with that, did it feel immediately that this is something. . .</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I wanna get this straight with you, right now. If I'm in it, it's there. If I'm in it, it's special. Hey. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> What was it about Somerset that you liked as a character? <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan4.RA\">Sound clip 4</a> ]</strong> </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Answering this question is going to do my image some damage. Somerset was a driving force in this story. A very excellent psychological drama. This character was the driving force, like Red in Shawshank. He was the narrator, he was the whole shooting match in terms of setting the mood, in terms of pushing the story along. That was Somerset. Aside from the fact that it was really a great script, it was a fabulously powerful character to play. It was a no-brainer.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> It was a really bleak movie though, right? Even Somerset being the glimmer of hope in that film. . .</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Yeah, bleak, bleak, bleak. But very, very immediate to me. It's a story that borders on fantasy because we were in a non-identifiable place in almost a phantasmigorical situation. I mean, imagine someone deciding that he's going to murder seven people for seven reasons. It had a great plot. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> In seven days. . .</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Seven days. They're all gonna be discovered in seven days. Victor (the sin of Sloth) was years, it went on for a long time, months, I guess. It wouldn't be years. There was this character who was brain dead, but he was still alive. He'd starved him to death, not to death even - right? Remember that character? What grabbed me about it was that fact, that this was the driving force, this really rather incredible script.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Do you see some kind of parallel between the John Doe character and the Somerset character?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Only when you pointed it out to me. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Two of the same bleak views. . .</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I never really did see that as a parallel until you pointed that out, until you mentioned that and then I could see. . . there was a moment in Se7en when they're driving out into the desert, and John Doe, the Kevin Spacey character, is talking about why he did what he did, and the moralist, played by Brad Pitt, is just ranting at him, and Somerset is asking these little low-key questions and watching and listening, but I think he is also thinking, \"Hmmm, you can't really argue with that, I see that.\" There are people out there who, between us, we look at them and we say, \"Gosh, why are they even living.\" And we go on - we don't start plotting to get rid of them, but we do that. So that was a parallel in that the world we're in, Somerset's character was brought on by the same things that are driving John Doe to commit his crimes that he's committing. Had you not pointed that out to me, Richard, I would have gone to my grave having never made that connection. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> So you got a taste for playing the detective after Se7en?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I always wanted to be a fireman, a cop, an Indian chief, a doctor, a lawyer. I always wanted to be all these things, so I am drawn to these kinds of characters.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> I know it annoys you that people say with Alex Cross (Kiss the Girls) and Somerset, \"Hold on, it's the same guy again.\" But it's not, is it? They're very different people.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> If they say that to me and it's true, then I have really hit bottom. I don't think it's the same guy. But I don't think John Wayne thought that any of his characters were the same guy, he just . . .</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> He's a very different kind of detective isn't he?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Oh, completely different. One guy's drives a Porsche and the other one walks.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> One wore a hat, the other -</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Yeah, one was a little older. . . so different costume designers.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Did you enjoy that experience, Kiss the Girls? </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I didn't really. Gary Fleder is a young man but he has a real flair for making movies. I like working with directors because I'm really opinionated as you might, or might not have gathered by now, about what things work and may not work, what audiences like and may not like, (not really) but I do have opinions about things. I like to be able to say them and then have them acted on. The director who responds to me like that, always gets my appreciation. I do appreciate it. What I find is the best directors, no matter what kind of name they have, are like that. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> The were a few rumours that came through from the Se7en period, that you and Brad, while you worked well, there were moments that were explosive, you kind of disagreed. Was that true?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> No, that's rumour. We never actually disagreed. We had moments where we had difficulty getting the shot, getting the scene done but I don't recall that we ever had any serious tension between us. There might have been one moment when I opened my mouth once too often. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> There was a tension between the characters at the beginning. . .</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Yeah, that was serious, but Brad and I got along. I get along with actors. I could name on one hand that I've worked with that I would have something unkind to say about. And then that I'm sort of making up. </p> <p> <strong>RJ:</strong> You just finished working with (director) Stephen Hopkins as well. What do you think he's got? What did you like about the way he worked?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Hopkins is another one. . . now when I say young, I mean people who are under 60. Hopkins, I don't know if he fits in that category. But when you've got to do a new project with a director, if he deigns and usually, if you've been round a minute or two like I have, he deigns to do an interview with you about the project. There is something that grabs you. What Fincher did, we went to dinner and he said, 'This is what I want to do.' And I could see it. In that context, I can be directed. You can say to me, 'Morgan, wait. Don't say that line until I get this far around so that I can get that light on this side of your face'. I understand it very clearly and I will do as many takes you want to do to get it just the way you want it. Make sure I understand and it's no problem. Hopkins is like that, y'know? He's one of those who sits down and says, 'The way I see it is like this' - wow, I never thought of that, what a great idea. What do I have to do? 'Well what you have to do is what you do', but every once and awhile he'll say, 'Just step around a little bit more' - that's a technical thing. Simple. Directors who want to direct actors are headed for trouble. I don't like to be directed. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> I mean the directing is in the casting, right? I mean they cast you for a reason?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I believe that's what most of us believe. If you cast it right, you just hire someone to say 'Action'. They come in later and say 'Cut'.</p> <p> <strong>RJ:</strong> I think this quite neatly to actors who become directors. I think before we talk about your own directorial debut with Bopha!, let's talk about Eastwood. Can he direct?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Oh yeah. Eastwood is non-pretentious. <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan5.RA\">sound clip 5</a> ]</strong> Three takes and you've got it. No question about it, move on. You don't have to do 17 takes because you think maybe there's something else you can show me: \"I really like that third take, we're moving on.\" I love that. I think that's the way to make a movie. Some actors don't like that at all: \"I need 15 takes because I'm pumping during the first 14 , I'm just pumping. Building. By 15 I'm up high enough I'm going to give you an award-winning performance.\" It's true of some actors, it's true of Meryl Streep. Nobody can deny that this woman is beyond magic, but she worked with Clint Eastwood. She's like: \"Where you going?\" \"We've got it.\" \"NO, that was a rehearsal!\" Hoffman, Dustin Hoffman. Dustin pumps, pumps, pumps. What's wrong with that is that you've got to up there pumping with him. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Did you get it?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> One more. But you know it's all fun. We all have our different ways of doing it and you have to go along with whomever.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Did you feel confident about your directorial debut?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> No, it was the first time. The year, two years before, or a year and a half before, I had worked on a second project with John Avildsen. So I said to John Avildsen, 'John, I'm getting ready to direct a movie.' He said, 'Great. I think you're going to do really wonderful. If you want any advice from me at all, just ask. If you want to stand around a camera, anything you want, y'know, do. But my best advice to you is, listen.' I got that, because I believed that already. Then I worked with Clint in the very next movie and watched a guy who got it one take or he got it in two takes or he got it in three takes. He packed up and he changed sets. That's the way you can have the courage to do that. You can look at it and say: 'Got it. Move it.' That's how I shot Bopha! We got it, we moved it. Didn't we? One day we were doing a soccer match. We did 32 set-ups in one afternoon. Let me tell you, that's moving. </p> <p> <strong>RJ:</strong> Why that project, why Bopha!?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Well, Bopha! was dropped in my lap. This guy comes along with a script and he wants me to star in it and direct it. I looked at the script and it's a story set in South Africa and it's about a black South African policeman. There were a bunch of those guys, black policemen on the townships. They had lives that were horrendous. Their families fall apart because no one on the township respects them. Hates them, actually. This man thought of himself as being a pillar of the community because he had a profession, because he believed in the law. He was really deep into it. He had a child, a son, who was coming of age, getting ready to come out of high school. He's my son, y'know, he's going to follow me into this, as soon as you graduate and we can go the academy. This kid is the leader of the student rebellion and it winds up with them coming head on and him having to arrest his own son. It was a horrendous thing. Riots, it was a great story. And we made a really good movie. It was Danny Glover and some great English actors and some South African actors. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Did it give you a taste for directing? </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Oh, yeah, I enjoyed it so much. I really, really, really enjoyed the experience of helming, to use the Variety term for directing a movie, for being captain, for controlling the ship. But there are politics involved that I cannot deal with. We were Hollywood going to Africa to shoot a movie, not about black people, about Africans. And we looked at the script and we looked at South Africa and we looked at the script again and all of a sudden, we gotta do this and we got into trouble. We made the movie, but we got into trouble. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Why?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> We had to kill the leading man. This cop, the movie starts off with a necklace. They take a tyre, soak it with gasoline, put it round a person and light it. The movie opened with this scene. Setting this cop on fire. So we don't like cops in this area. We don't like 'em, they're. . . and it goes on down. In the end, what the original script wanted was a coming together between father and son, some sort of d\u00e9tente. They had this riot, all these kids were shot down, by the police. And they have their rallies at the funerals. They are all at these funerals, seven or eight kids that they're burying at one time and now he's denounced his stuff. He shows up at the funeral, this is the end of the movie. They're telling, the powers, that he's got to, he and his son, that they've got to have that moment together. And so with looking at this and looking at this, and Danny says, 'He's never going to make it through that crowd. They're not going to beat him up, they're going to kill him!' So he's got to die. That's the only way he can get redemption. That's the only redeeming possibility in this story. So we said to a man, producers, directors, actors: 'That's it'. So we all went with it. The studio said: 'Under no circumstances can you shoot that ending'. Well they were in Hollywood and we were in South Africa, so. . . ! <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,344735,00.html\">To next page</a></p> <p> <strong>Sound clips</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan1.RA\">\"The big mistake was Driving Miss Daisy\"</a> (2mins 06) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan2.RA\">\"You're never going to get away from being a black actor\"</a> (1 min) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan3.RA\">\"Method is a misnomer\"</a> (41 seconds) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan4.RA\">On Somerset in Se7en</a> (1min 19) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan5.RA\">On working with Eastwood in Unforgiven</a> (1min 14) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan6.RA\">\"On screen I see me through the audience\"</a> (1min 19) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan7.RA\">\"The problem with the Oscars is that if you don't win, you lose\"</a> (34 seconds) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan8.RA\">\"I do everything well, I mean, I'm an actor\"</a> (51 seconds)</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shawshank Redemption | Gene Hackman | Method acting | Se7en | Under Suspicion | Eastwood | Bopha! RJ: Yeah. You mentioned Shawshank - MF: Shemshonk. Shemsham. RJ: Tell us about your relationship with Tim Robbins and how you bonded with him. In those lonely prison cells. MF: Shawshank was one of those situations where I was first hired and they ran a whole bunch of possibilities past me: Who do you wanna work with? Tim Robbins. So it was me and Tim. He is another one of those actors, who, I think he is just transcendent in his work. When he got his teeth into something he is totally watchable. Absolutely engrossing, to me. And we, I think actors who have characters who they totally understand help each other understand even more and I think that was what was happening with us. The deeper we got, the more we shot, the more we understood each other. The bonding was just the normal character thing. Of course we're close friends now. It's a transcendent moment for us as actors that the movie comes out and becomes what it has become. One of the most watched, one of the most rented videos, I guess in the world. RJ: How does Frank Darabont stand up against the very eclectic bag of people you've worked with? MF: Frank. I have a problem with writer/directors, personal. I can't work well with both of them on the set, if both of them are giving instructions. Writers tend to be in love with what they wrote. You can't always translate the words into the meaning, sometimes the meaning is better served without the words, difficult to make a writer to try to understand that. It gets, sometimes, tense. RJ: He speaks very highly of you. He was in town recently! MF: And I think highly of him too - he directed that movie! I didn't direct the movie. He wrote it, he directed it, it's his movie, his mark and it's a great film. RJ: It connected you with people that movie, didn't it? MF: Oh, absolutely. RJ: What do you think was the heartbeat of that movie that connected to people in such a general way? MF: The development, the relationship of those two men. What happened at the end took everybody all the way through that movie. That he got out and he somehow remembered that there was help somewhere, I mean Red. And ultimately the two of them came together. Like old lovers. The rejoining of two people who cared a lot about each other. A lot of movie say they love that movie and I know why, because it's about love. RJ: You are drawn to a certain kind of actor aren't you? We've seen it tonight with Gene Hackman. Gene Hackman is of course, the star, but you don't think of him as a sort of star, you think of him as an actor. Is that something that you would like to be regarded as? MF: Oh yes, absolutely. I know for a fact, I know, that when you get the sobriquet, 'star', that label is put on you so that the audience will come to see you. You. An actor thinks the audience is coming to see what you're doing. Am I making sense there? In other words, I don't like to think of myself as a personality. I can't wear a nose ring, dreadlocks, or any of that - because my next character has to be able to fit what's on the page - rather than have the page fit what I'm walking around with. RJ: I think that's very well explained. MF: Phew. RJ: I think even worthy of an Oscar nomination, I think. MF: No one mentioned that I got my third Oscar nomination for Shawshank. RJ: We did skip by that didn't we? MF: Oh, it's alright, it's okay. RJ: Hackman. Let's get a few words on Hackman, because he's a tour de force, isn't he? MF: This is another one of those situations where, I don't know, I'm a child of the movies, I grew up going to the movies. Every day I could get the 12 cents together, eventually it was 25 cents, and now it's $10 - and you don't even get a cartoon. So I idolise movie actors, both sexes. Hackman is one of those people. He's a movie actor, boy he's an actor and every time I go see him I just marvel at him. I just. . . When I go to movies, not only am I being entertained, but I am also being trained as an actor because I am shameless in my thievery. If I can make it work for me and you did it, well, sue me. You're not going to be able to look like anyone else, no matter how hard you try, unless you're a mimic, then you're not acting, you're just mimicking. You can't go on being John Wayne, that's John Wayne. So you're not going to steal from John Wayne. I'm not going to steal from John Wayne and you're not going to come back and say 'Didn't you get that from the circus?' You know. But he is one of those people who instructs me, whom I look up to - whom I think is one of the masters of his craft that I am so enamoured of. So the opportunity and the, there's another word that means what happens when someone says you're good enough to do this, what is it? But if Gene says 'Morgan, here's a piece that I would like us to do' I mean, it's Gene Hackman. You know. You may think it's different, but that's me - that's how I react to having the opportunity to work with these people I think so highly of. RJ: When you're that close to them and you're working that closely with them, what is it you appropriate from them? MF: I am not sure I can answer all of that because what is it that makes a Picasso a Picasso - what is it that makes Gene Hackman the actor he is? Wherever he goes with what he does, he totally focused on what he's doing. He's not commenting on it, he's not grandstanding with it, he's just focusing on being the deepest and best he can be. And that helps you be the deepest and the best you can be. An actor who's going to run towards the cliff, hold his nose and jump - just hold hands and do it. What was that from? Quick. Audience member: Butch Cassidy. MF: You are so bright. RJ: So he's got that instinctive thing? MF: Yes, instinct is the right word, it's almost automatic. You learn technique, but it's ingrained - what it is - how it is, is what you learn. RJ: I get the feeling that you also share with him the belief that if it's not on the page you're not going to make it happen on the screen. It needs to be fundamentally there. MF: Yes, it has to be fundamentally there. I think that the great unsung heroes of movies are the writers - you look at the movie credits and you might see eight writers from an idea - but if it's not on the page, you're not likely to get it, not so that your audience likes it. Every hole, every place where you've patched it, every mis-step, every plot contrivance. And the hardest thing to do is to tell people who are sitting in some of these front offices, 'Audiences think, stupid. You can trust that they think.' A lot of people think that you've got to be spoon fed every little want, every little thing. I don't think that either. You know why I don't think that? Because I am in the audience. I go to movies too. RJ: And you want to believe it. You want to sit there and believe it. MF: Absolutely. Almost TEN DOLLARS! RJ: You've never gone to the extreme to the method acting. You said earlier in your career you investigated certain technical things, but beyond that, I know when you were working with Brad Pitt, in Se7en, that Brad liked to take it as far as he could in taking up everything in that kind of method-y way - MF: Listen, method is a misnomer. [ sound clip 3 ] No one is really a method actor, everyone has their way of going about it, preparing for it, but method is preparation, it's what you do to prepare. So my method is to read the script. Some actors' method is to read the script a hundred times and in the doing of it, to immerse themselves in as much of the reality as possible. Me, I believe strictly in acting. If I am out of breath, I'm out of breath. I ain't running nowhere. RJ: So how quickly did you connect with Somerset then when you read Se7en? MF: I put the script down and I was ready to go on the set. All you need when you know it, when you read it and you say 'Oooh, oooh. Find me a costume designer, quick. 'Cause I need this, this, this and this.' Costume designer comes along and says, 'Y'know I was thinking about this, this, this and a hat.' (makes big smooching sound) We're in, we're homefree. Simple. It isn't rocket science. Well, it is, but we make it up as we go. RJ: Was it all on the page then? MF: Every line, every nuance. Everything was on the page except the manner in which the director wanted to shoot it and the lighting. RJ: And that is where the boat was pushed out, right? You tried to take a crime thriller and do something new with it? Did you achieve that? MF: I think he did it in spades. This young guy, this David Fincher, he comes out of the Northern Californian school system but he was like, a drop-out. He started making music videos, so he is very computer literate, graphic oriented, knows all about film. He wanted to shoot this movie dark, he wanted it dark, so he was going to do a reclamation process, where you would take all of the silver nitrate that comes out of the wash when you develop the film, run it back through again, which takes the shaded, the dark parts of the movie and makes it darker. That just dampens down the entire movie. The light, the colours, makes it deeper. That is what he did. The problem with the process is that in the newer theatres, they have a different lighting system than the old arc light, that were in the reel to reels. So in those the light you have to pump it way up in order to get the light, because if you don't - people really can't see. RJ: So he hadn't thought it through, had he? MF: Well, he'd thought it through, but we want to look at it in the big theatres in Hollywood, we're not going to go to the art houses. RJ: Did you feel that you were involved in a special project with that, did it feel immediately that this is something. . . MF: I wanna get this straight with you, right now. If I'm in it, it's there. If I'm in it, it's special. Hey. RJ: What was it about Somerset that you liked as a character? [ Sound clip 4 ] MF: Answering this question is going to do my image some damage. Somerset was a driving force in this story. A very excellent psychological drama. This character was the driving force, like Red in Shawshank. He was the narrator, he was the whole shooting match in terms of setting the mood, in terms of pushing the story along. That was Somerset. Aside from the fact that it was really a great script, it was a fabulously powerful character to play. It was a no-brainer. RJ: It was a really bleak movie though, right? Even Somerset being the glimmer of hope in that film. . . MF: Yeah, bleak, bleak, bleak. But very, very immediate to me. It's a story that borders on fantasy because we were in a non-identifiable place in almost a phantasmigorical situation. I mean, imagine someone deciding that he's going to murder seven people for seven reasons. It had a great plot. RJ: In seven days. . . MF: Seven days. They're all gonna be discovered in seven days. Victor (the sin of Sloth) was years, it went on for a long time, months, I guess. It wouldn't be years. There was this character who was brain dead, but he was still alive. He'd starved him to death, not to death even - right? Remember that character? What grabbed me about it was that fact, that this was the driving force, this really rather incredible script. RJ: Do you see some kind of parallel between the John Doe character and the Somerset character? MF: Only when you pointed it out to me. RJ: Two of the same bleak views. . . MF: I never really did see that as a parallel until you pointed that out, until you mentioned that and then I could see. . . there was a moment in Se7en when they're driving out into the desert, and John Doe, the Kevin Spacey character, is talking about why he did what he did, and the moralist, played by Brad Pitt, is just ranting at him, and Somerset is asking these little low-key questions and watching and listening, but I think he is also thinking, \"Hmmm, you can't really argue with that, I see that.\" There are people out there who, between us, we look at them and we say, \"Gosh, why are they even living.\" And we go on - we don't start plotting to get rid of them, but we do that. So that was a parallel in that the world we're in, Somerset's character was brought on by the same things that are driving John Doe to commit his crimes that he's committing. Had you not pointed that out to me, Richard, I would have gone to my grave having never made that connection. RJ: So you got a taste for playing the detective after Se7en? MF: I always wanted to be a fireman, a cop, an Indian chief, a doctor, a lawyer. I always wanted to be all these things, so I am drawn to these kinds of characters. RJ: I know it annoys you that people say with Alex Cross (Kiss the Girls) and Somerset, \"Hold on, it's the same guy again.\" But it's not, is it? They're very different people. MF: If they say that to me and it's true, then I have really hit bottom. I don't think it's the same guy. But I don't think John Wayne thought that any of his characters were the same guy, he just . . . RJ: He's a very different kind of detective isn't he? MF: Oh, completely different. One guy's drives a Porsche and the other one walks. RJ: One wore a hat, the other - MF: Yeah, one was a little older. . . so different costume designers. RJ: Did you enjoy that experience, Kiss the Girls? MF: I didn't really. Gary Fleder is a young man but he has a real flair for making movies. I like working with directors because I'm really opinionated as you might, or might not have gathered by now, about what things work and may not work, what audiences like and may not like, (not really) but I do have opinions about things. I like to be able to say them and then have them acted on. The director who responds to me like that, always gets my appreciation. I do appreciate it. What I find is the best directors, no matter what kind of name they have, are like that. RJ: The were a few rumours that came through from the Se7en period, that you and Brad, while you worked well, there were moments that were explosive, you kind of disagreed. Was that true? MF: No, that's rumour. We never actually disagreed. We had moments where we had difficulty getting the shot, getting the scene done but I don't recall that we ever had any serious tension between us. There might have been one moment when I opened my mouth once too often. RJ: There was a tension between the characters at the beginning. . . MF: Yeah, that was serious, but Brad and I got along. I get along with actors. I could name on one hand that I've worked with that I would have something unkind to say about. And then that I'm sort of making up. RJ: You just finished working with (director) Stephen Hopkins as well. What do you think he's got? What did you like about the way he worked? MF: Hopkins is another one. . . now when I say young, I mean people who are under 60. Hopkins, I don't know if he fits in that category. But when you've got to do a new project with a director, if he deigns and usually, if you've been round a minute or two like I have, he deigns to do an interview with you about the project. There is something that grabs you. What Fincher did, we went to dinner and he said, 'This is what I want to do.' And I could see it. In that context, I can be directed. You can say to me, 'Morgan, wait. Don't say that line until I get this far around so that I can get that light on this side of your face'. I understand it very clearly and I will do as many takes you want to do to get it just the way you want it. Make sure I understand and it's no problem. Hopkins is like that, y'know? He's one of those who sits down and says, 'The way I see it is like this' - wow, I never thought of that, what a great idea. What do I have to do? 'Well what you have to do is what you do', but every once and awhile he'll say, 'Just step around a little bit more' - that's a technical thing. Simple. Directors who want to direct actors are headed for trouble. I don't like to be directed. RJ: I mean the directing is in the casting, right? I mean they cast you for a reason? MF: I believe that's what most of us believe. If you cast it right, you just hire someone to say 'Action'. They come in later and say 'Cut'. RJ: I think this quite neatly to actors who become directors. I think before we talk about your own directorial debut with Bopha!, let's talk about Eastwood. Can he direct? MF: Oh yeah. Eastwood is non-pretentious. [ sound clip 5 ] Three takes and you've got it. No question about it, move on. You don't have to do 17 takes because you think maybe there's something else you can show me: \"I really like that third take, we're moving on.\" I love that. I think that's the way to make a movie. Some actors don't like that at all: \"I need 15 takes because I'm pumping during the first 14 , I'm just pumping. Building. By 15 I'm up high enough I'm going to give you an award-winning performance.\" It's true of some actors, it's true of Meryl Streep. Nobody can deny that this woman is beyond magic, but she worked with Clint Eastwood. She's like: \"Where you going?\" \"We've got it.\" \"NO, that was a rehearsal!\" Hoffman, Dustin Hoffman. Dustin pumps, pumps, pumps. What's wrong with that is that you've got to up there pumping with him. RJ: Did you get it? MF: One more. But you know it's all fun. We all have our different ways of doing it and you have to go along with whomever. RJ: Did you feel confident about your directorial debut? MF: No, it was the first time. The year, two years before, or a year and a half before, I had worked on a second project with John Avildsen. So I said to John Avildsen, 'John, I'm getting ready to direct a movie.' He said, 'Great. I think you're going to do really wonderful. If you want any advice from me at all, just ask. If you want to stand around a camera, anything you want, y'know, do. But my best advice to you is, listen.' I got that, because I believed that already. Then I worked with Clint in the very next movie and watched a guy who got it one take or he got it in two takes or he got it in three takes. He packed up and he changed sets. That's the way you can have the courage to do that. You can look at it and say: 'Got it. Move it.' That's how I shot Bopha! We got it, we moved it. Didn't we? One day we were doing a soccer match. We did 32 set-ups in one afternoon. Let me tell you, that's moving. RJ: Why that project, why Bopha!? MF: Well, Bopha! was dropped in my lap. This guy comes along with a script and he wants me to star in it and direct it. I looked at the script and it's a story set in South Africa and it's about a black South African policeman. There were a bunch of those guys, black policemen on the townships. They had lives that were horrendous. Their families fall apart because no one on the township respects them. Hates them, actually. This man thought of himself as being a pillar of the community because he had a profession, because he believed in the law. He was really deep into it. He had a child, a son, who was coming of age, getting ready to come out of high school. He's my son, y'know, he's going to follow me into this, as soon as you graduate and we can go the academy. This kid is the leader of the student rebellion and it winds up with them coming head on and him having to arrest his own son. It was a horrendous thing. Riots, it was a great story. And we made a really good movie. It was Danny Glover and some great English actors and some South African actors. RJ: Did it give you a taste for directing? MF: Oh, yeah, I enjoyed it so much. I really, really, really enjoyed the experience of helming, to use the Variety term for directing a movie, for being captain, for controlling the ship. But there are politics involved that I cannot deal with. We were Hollywood going to Africa to shoot a movie, not about black people, about Africans. And we looked at the script and we looked at South Africa and we looked at the script again and all of a sudden, we gotta do this and we got into trouble. We made the movie, but we got into trouble. RJ: Why? MF: We had to kill the leading man. This cop, the movie starts off with a necklace. They take a tyre, soak it with gasoline, put it round a person and light it. The movie opened with this scene. Setting this cop on fire. So we don't like cops in this area. We don't like 'em, they're. . . and it goes on down. In the end, what the original script wanted was a coming together between father and son, some sort of d\u00e9tente. They had this riot, all these kids were shot down, by the police. And they have their rallies at the funerals. They are all at these funerals, seven or eight kids that they're burying at one time and now he's denounced his stuff. He shows up at the funeral, this is the end of the movie. They're telling, the powers, that he's got to, he and his son, that they've got to have that moment together. And so with looking at this and looking at this, and Danny says, 'He's never going to make it through that crowd. They're not going to beat him up, they're going to kill him!' So he's got to die. That's the only way he can get redemption. That's the only redeeming possibility in this story. So we said to a man, producers, directors, actors: 'That's it'. So we all went with it. The studio said: 'Under no circumstances can you shoot that ending'. Well they were in Hollywood and we were in South Africa, so. . . !

Unarguably, it is an improvement of the GB Plc tone of earlier versions of the government\u0092s annual report. It also has a laudable civic aim. Tony Blair has been accused of soap opera politics with himself at the centre of the plot.

Frustrated by its failure to make any headway against a tide of cynicism over its efforts to convince voters of its achievements, it has adopted a new style in its annual report published yesterday. Out go the politicians, out go the big numbers and in comes an intimate chatty collection of tales of ordinary folk. So we get to hear about David Bardsley who is a driver on the Manchester Metrolink and Sue Trott who runs a restaurant in Newton Abbott. In comes an interactive web gimmick: type in your postcode and learn of government largesse in your neighbourhood. Welcome to the personalisation of government. Unarguably, it is an improvement of the GB Plc tone of earlier versions of the government\u0092s annual report. It also has a laudable civic aim. Tony Blair has been accused of soap opera politics with himself at the centre of the plot. This is Number 10\u0092s attempt to shift the Blair Family - Euan, Leo and Cherie - from centre stage and bring on a huge supporting cast of what it describes as government \u0093frontline staff\u0094.

Johann Wolfgang (not yet von) Goethe, the prodigiously talented son of a prosperous Frankfurt citizen, startles his compatriots with a furious and rambling play, G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen (1771), which effectively inaugurates modern drama in Germany. He then writes The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774), a melancholy novel in letters, and becomes an immensely influential European figure, a provoker of fashions in dress and suicide, a sort of Byron before Byron. He is 25.</p> <p>Troubled by this success in print - G\u00f6tz was published to great acclaim but not staged for some time - Goethe seeks a different public and a different relation to the world. He moves to Weimar in 1775, where he becomes confidential adviser and then minister and privy councillor to the Duke. He is made a baron in 1782. Weimar at this time is a city of 6000 inhabitants, compared with Frankfurt's 36,000. But Weimar is also the centre of a duchy, which includes the territories of Jena, Eisenach and Ilmenau. It is a little world but it is a world.</p> <p>Goethe occupies himself with mines, politics, the development of the University of Jena. He starts several lengthy writing projects but finishes few, although at this time as at all times he writes remarkable poems in many genres. He becomes frustrated, both by the burdens of office and by the stranglement of what appears to have been a long Platonic affair with a married court lady, Frau von Stein. He longs to travel in Italy, a journey he has often imagined, and which he postponed when he came to Weimar. Finally, in 1786, he asks for and is given a leave of absence and takes off for the better part of two years, visiting Verona, Padua, Venice and Naples, and staying for some time in Sicily and (twice) in Rome.</p> <p>He finds a new life among German artists in Italy - 'artists' here means painters and sculptors, but Goethe, and Schiller soon after him, convert the word to something like its modern meaning, where it includes writers and film-makers, for example. 'I have found myself again,' Goethe writes to the Duke, 'but as what? - As an artist!' This is a declaration of independence of sorts, but Goethe knows he can't stay in Italy. He returns to Weimar, works again on his Faust, finishes other plays (Iphigenia in Tauris, Egmont, Tasso), elaborates an early version of his novel Wilhelm Meister, and publishes his Collected Works in eight volumes.</p> <p>He also grieves extensively for the warm, permissive South and his lost artist colony in Rome, but realises, on a brief return trip to Venice, that his future lies in Germany. Italy had been paradise, or rather a proof that paradise exists and can be abandoned. Goethe is happy with the sterner North, or says he is. 'The Duchess is well and contented,' he writes of his employer's mother's homecoming from her Italian trip, 'as one is when one returns from paradise. I am now used to it, and this time I was quite happy to leave Italy.' Used to his return, he means, and used to the absence from paradise. The words I have just quoted are the last words of the first volume of Nicholas Boyle's biography of Goethe. The date is June 1790, and other things have been happening in Europe, to which Boyle immediately turns in his new book.</p> <p>Germany at this time was far from a nation state - it was a confusion of duchies and principalities and free cities, shadowed by the rising power of Prussia and the continuing presence of Austria at the centre of a slightly rickety Holy Roman Empire - but it was full of national feeling, of stirrings and reachings towards a shared culture.</p> <p>Thought and literature travelled fast, and Boyle expertly evokes their journeys. He is emphatic that Goethe doesn't reflect or resemble his age; but equally emphatic that the writer and his age can be understood only if we look at them together. '\"The Age of Goethe\" is simply the series of literary and intellectual temptations which, as it happens, Goethe resisted.' Not so simply, perhaps; and certainly not just 'as it happens'. Boyle says at the outset of his first volume that 1749 to 1832, the period of Goethe's life, is not one age but several. 'To think otherwise is to diminish the man and to misrepresent the time - his time, and ours.'</p> <p>This must be true in the long run, and presumably will be seen to be true in Boyle's completed work. But his first volume, and even the second, show us a Goethe rather more associated with his age than not. It's true there are 29 years to go.</p> <p>Meanwhile, loyal to his overall idea but scrupulous about individual historical moments, Boyle keeps offering modest disclaimers. Werther has a 'uniquely close relationship to its public'. 'Goethe's personal experience at this time' - 1773 - 'was... approximating to, and becoming symbolically representative of, that of a whole generation'; 'Goethe at this time in his life, as never again, spoke directly from and to the situation of his contemporaries'; 'He was very soon seen as the most prominent representative of a movement. For once, this was not wholly a misapprehension.' Boyle's general argument seems to be that Goethe was quite different from his contemporaries, but more German than they were - or more attuned to German possibilities, inventor and citizen of a Germany that never quite happened.</p> <p>'If Werther is the moment of his nearest identity with his public, Urfaust is the first major work in which he establishes the initial distance of his own subjectivity from that of his contemporaries which will be characteristic of all his subsequent writing.' Goethe is becoming Goethe as Boyle sees him, and 'initial distance' is the phrase which establishes the room for manoeuvre. Weimar allowed Goethe to live 'on the edge of centrality', and he settled there because 'with the unconscious sureness of a sleepwalker, perhaps, he was finding his way to the one place where he could bring the centre of gravity of his own life as close as possible to the political centre of gravity of what was destined to be the nation, while retaining the generously broad and multifarious conception of nationhood of his Strasbourg and Frankfurt years'.</p> <p>Quite apart from the edgy combination of 'sureness' and 'perhaps', this is an extraordinary proposition, less an explanation of Goethe's behaviour than an exposition of what the name 'Goethe' means, but none the less valuable for that. Goethe's 'universal genius', in this perspective, means not that he was a talented painter and wrote poems, plays, novels, satires, libretti, an autobiography, studies of plant life and a theoretical treatise on colour, having also effectively run a small country, directed a theatre, and established a university, but that he knew how to make the edge of centrality a centre of gravity. A mixed metaphor, but the mixture was his gift.</p> <p>Boyle calls his first volume The Poetry of Desire because a terrific yearning marks all Goethe's best work of this period. 'None but the lonely heart' is the traditional translation of 'Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt', a song Goethe gives to his character Mignon in Wilhelm Meister. Boyle calls this poem a 'half-strangled cry', and his literal version begins 'Only he who knows yearning', but even 'yearning' can't catch the world-emptying force of Sehnsucht, a longing which is more like a disease than a feeling, and whose very existence seems to deny the possibility of fulfilment. Italy complicated this emotion for Goethe, since it showed him that fulfilment, sexual and otherwise, was possible.</p> <p>The place that Mignon dreams of, in another song, 'the land where the lemon trees bloom, the golden oranges glow amid the dark leaves, a gentle wind blows from the blue sky, the myrtle stands motionless and the bay tree tall' (Boyle's translation), really does exist, is not just a Northerner's fantasy. What Goethe now denies is not the fulfilment of desire but the desirability of fulfilment. It is important in this perspective that satisfaction should actually be possible, just as sexual chances need to exist for celibacy to be a moral option rather than a plight. What Goethe learned in Italy, Boyle says, was 'where his true spiritual home lay - not, after all, in Mignon's Vicenza but in a land where only those who knew yearning could know what he suffered'. Not in Italy but in Germany, that is, though both places have become allegories of desire, and strange, exclusive ideas crowd into the very thought of the nation. What you need to be a German is not a passport but a proper sense of Sehnsucht.</p> <p>The last lines of the dedicatory poem called 'Zueignung', which opens Faust: Part One, are translated by John Williams as</p> <p> What I possess now vanishes before me,<br> And what was lost alone has substance for me.</p> <p>Was ich besitze, seh' ich wie im Weiten,<br> Und was verschwand, wird mir zu <br> Wirklichkeiten.</p> <p>The English lines are graceful and sensitive, but a more literal rendering brings out the paradox more fully, the commitment to the permanence of fulfillable but unfulfilled desire. 'What I possess, I see as if at a distance/And what disappeared becomes reality for me.' There is still a mild ambiguity here, and even a literal translation is defeated by Goethe's crafty plural: 'becomes realities for me'. Did what disappeared become reality because it disappeared? Because the poet only thought it was there, and now needs it as a memory? That would be a familiar form of nostalgia, and must be an important part of what 'Germany' came to mean in what wasn't the age of Goethe.</p> <p>But the other reading, and the one most consistent with Boyle's entirely persuasive argument, is that real things are (still) possessed and have disappeared. The poet is saying that among the world's available realities only the disappeared ones are real to him now. This is not quite Proust's claim that the only true paradises are lost paradises, but it is close to his idea that significant realities are formed not only in the mind but always in the mind as well. Boyle writes in his second volume of 'the disappointments of fulfilled desire', but I'm not sure we have to go that far, or that we have to speak, as Boyle rather grimly does, of 'the prison of sated appetite'. Satisfaction would be enough, and not enough. We could be happy and also know that happiness isn't everything.</p> <p>Goethe worked on Faust for most of his life. A version of 1775-76, now known as the Urfaust, survives in a copy which was rediscovered only in 1887. He published Faust: A Fragment in 1790, and Faust: Part One in 1808. He finished Faust: Part Two just before he died. Williams's version includes Part One and the Urfaust, and a handful of additional scenes for the Walpurgisnacht episode in Part One. Among the very many things that could be said about this imaginative new translation - even the hardened offender is going to blanch a little at the thought of reviewing Faust - two seem to me to stand out.</p> <p>The first results from a combination of Williams's translating practice and a critical point made by Boyle. Williams mentions the 'huge variety' of metres and verse forms Goethe uses in the play, and, discussing 'Commentary of an Old Woodcut', Boyle remarks that 'English poetry, whose vehicle is the language of a profoundly class-conscious culture, lacks the middle tone between verse and doggerel in which this poem like most of Faust, is written.' Many people have wondered why it is so hard to get Goethe to sound even creditable in English, let alone like a major poet, and this is surely an excellent explanation at least for part of the difficulty. The trouble with the simple lyric poems may just be their extraordinary simplicity, and faced with the renowned '\u00dcber allen Gipfeln/ Ist Ruh,' Boyle just throws up his hands: 'There is little sensible that literary criticism can say about something so delicate and so matchless.' I'm sure this is right, and I'm not going to say anything sensible or otherwise right now. But I do think literary criticism ought not to give up so easily.</p> <p>And it does seem plausible that even in the age of Wordsworth, English couldn't get close enough to knockabout comedy to use popular verse to real effect. When men spoke like men speaking to men, they spoke slowly and wisely. We might think that in Eliot's Sweeney Agonistes English was still trying, and not quite achieving, Goethe's 'middle tone'. Of course the stuff still sounds like doggerel in English, but it's possible to imagine something that is not doggerel lurking behind it. Take these lines from the opening of the Urfaust:</p> <p> Medicine, and Law, and Philosophy -<br> Even, God help you, Theology;<br> You've worked your way through every school<br> And sweated at it like a fool...</p> <p>These jars and cases row on row,<br> Retorts and tubes and taps and gauges,<br> The useless junk of bygone ages -<br> This is the only world you know!</p> <p>'God help you' is a good rendering of leider, 'unfortunately', and 'sweated at' is a genuinely idiomatic version of heisser M\u00fch, 'hot care'. Of course nothing in English will quite catch the despair in the last line, heightened rather than diminished by the sense of doggerel and the amazing pantomime word vollgepfropft. 'That is your world, that is what they (or you or anyone) call a world.'</p> <p> Hab' nun ach die Philosophei<br> Medizin und Juristerei<br> Und leider auch die Theologie<br> Durchaus studiert mit heisser M\u00fch'...</p> <p>Mit Gl\u00e4sern B\u00fcchsen rings bestellt<br> Mit Instrumenten vollgepfropft,<br> Uhrv\u00e4ter Hausrat drein gestopft,<br> Das ist deine Welt, das heisst eine Welt!</p> <p>The other thing that struck me in reading Faust: Part One and the Urfaust back to back, along with Boyle's excellent comments on the whole Faust project, is the shift in Faust's passions, ambitions, faults, temptations. Obvious and familiar enough to Goethe scholars, I'm sure, but a mixture of a memory and a revelation to me. The figure in the Urfaust makes no pact with the devil, not because Goethe didn't plan one but because he didn't write the scene. The effect, however, is to convert Mephistopheles into the agent not of some malign power but of Faust's own more cynical thoughts. Not only his shadow, as Boyle says, but something like his negative conscience, the part of his mind which will not tolerate the Wertherian sentimentality of the rest.</p> <p>To put it too crudely, once Faust launches into his romance with Gretchen, he thinks he can seduce an innocent maiden and remain a nice fellow, indeed a romantic hero, rather than a skunk, and Mephistopheles is under no illusions on this score. Gretchen herself, in her distrust of Faust's companion, could be read as intuiting the other side, or even the real truth, of the man she loves. 'How you can live with him I just don't know,' she says.</p> <p> I even think, whenever he is here,<br> My very love for you might ebb away,<br> And I could never pray when he is near.</p> <p>wo er mag zu uns treten,<br> Mein' ich sogar ich liebte dich nicht mehr.<br> Und wenn er da ist k\u00f6nnt' ich nimmer beten.</p> <p>Gretchen's last words, apart from her calling of Faust's name, are 'mir grauts vor dir', well translated by Williams as 'you horrify me,' although grauen has an additional suggestion of 'fear' and 'shivers' and 'creeps'. It is Faust who horrifies her, as well as Mephistopheles.</p> <p>The hero of Faust: Part One is a fullblown thinker and poet, a one-man conversion of the Enlightenment into the Romantic Movement. He is tired of learning, rapturously contemplates suicide, is brought back to life by memory, 'the feelings of childhood'. He has fabulous, famous lines, and Mephistopheles is no longer a version of the reality principle but a goad to desire, the cold instrument of endless heat, an indispensable aid to unfulfilment:</p> <p> But now I see that we can never know<br> Perfection here on earth. For with this bliss<br> That brings me ever closer to the gods,<br> You gave me that cold and insolent companion<br> From whom I can no longer free myself,<br> Who makes me feel my shame and my<br> disgrace,<br> And turns your gifts to dross with every<br> breath.<br> He fans the flames that burn within my heart,<br> And fires my longing for that lovely form.<br> I satisfy desire with pleasure, then<br> In pleasure languish for desire again.</p> <p>O, dass dem Menschen nichts Vollkommnes<br> wird,<br> Empfind' ich nun. Du gabst mir zu dieser<br> Wonne,<br> Die mich den G\u00f6ttern nah und n\u00e4her bringt,<br> Mir den Gef\u00e4hrten, den ich schon nicht mehr<br> Entbehren kann, wenn er gleich, kalt und<br> frech,<br> Mich vor mir selbst erniedrigt, und zu nichts,<br> Mit einem Worthauch, deine Gaben wandelt.<br> Er facht in meiner Brust ein wildes Feuer<br> Nach jenem sch\u00f6nem Bild gesch\u00e4ftig an.<br> So tauml' ich von Begierde zu Genuss,<br> Und im Genuss verschmacht' ich nach<br> Begierde.</p> <p>The deity being addressed here is the Earth Spirit, whom Faust once conjured up but found 'too terrible'. Williams doesn't quite manage to get the hectic energy of Faust's complaint, his restless eagerness for what he says he doesn't want. The German has him 'tumbling' from desire to pleasure, the very image of the intellectual released into the life of the senses. And Faust doesn't say he can't free himself from his cold companion, he says he can't do without him.</p> <p>And of course this Faust makes a complicated pact with Mephistopheles, which effectively reveals the devil as the instrument not only of desire but of a God who will sanction anything in the name of desire. In a Prologue in Heaven, God says 'man will err as long as he can strive,' but he (or Goethe) means or comes to mean the opposite: a man who keeps striving can't go wrong. Among the last words of Faust: Part Two, delivered by an angel carrying off Faust's immortal soul, are these: 'Wer immer strebend sich bem\u00fcht,/Den k\u00f6nnen wir erl\u00f6sen' - very roughly, 'Whoever takes pains to keep striving/Is someone we can redeem.' The terms of Faust's pact are, as everyone says, one of the key formulations of a modern morality - 'the morality of modernity itself', Boyle suggests. Faust proposes:</p> <p> If I should ever choose a life of sloth or<br> leisure,<br> Then let that moment be my end!...<br> If I should bid the moment stay, or try<br> To hold its fleeting beauty, then you may<br> Cast me in chains and carry me away.</p> <p>Werd' ich beruhigt je mich auf ein Faulbett<br> legen,<br> So sei es gleich um mich getan!...<br> Werd' ich zum Augenblicke sagen:<br> Verweile doch! du bist so sch\u00f6n!<br> Dann magst du mich in Fesseln schlagen,<br> Dann will ich gern zugrunde gehen.</p> <p>It's a spectacular wager, but in Goethe's world the devil hasn't got a chance.</p> <p>There are all kinds of risks in a long biography, but two seem to stand out: that of turning all molehills into mountains, and that of just plodding, when not even molehills are available, through the days and hours of a life. Boyle doesn't entirely avoid the first risk, although there aren't too many molehills to start with, but he triumphantly avoids the second through the sheer intelligence of his writing, the firmness of his focus on the Goethe he has in mind. He also has the great knack of turning what is often thought of as cultural or historical background into vivid foreground, so that his sections on Kant or Schiller or H\u00f6lderlin or Hegel or Fichte, for example, read like the intellectual adventure they represent, and his account of the Prussian military campaign against the French Republic, on which Goethe accompanied his Duke Carl August, is as harrowing as a harsh war movie.</p> <p> Over half the army now was infected with dysentery, between the tents lay the bloody excreta of those unable to reach the latrines in time, the latrines themselves were nauseating with blood and matter, and a plague of lice broke out... Dead horses were left to clog the ditches, human arms and legs protruded from the hasty and shallow graves, and Goethe saw a wounded horse, which no one could be bothered to shoot, entangling itself in its own entrails.</p> <p>The Bastille falls in Boyle's second volume, and, as he says in his first sentence, the world changes. By the end of the book Napoleon is in power, and we are seeing what Boyle calls 'the beginning of the long postponed demolition of old Germany'. Somehow in the turmoil of Europe, Goethe manages to settle down into a de facto marriage to Christiana Vulpius, frowned on and snickered at but finally accepted by aristocratic Weimar. He and Christiana have a child, and four more children are either stillborn or die very early.</p> <p>Goethe's friendship and partnership with Schiller, who lives in Jena - they edit a journal together, closely discuss each other's work - develops at this time, and Boyle has many shrewd things to say about Schiller's understanding and misunderstanding of Goethe, and about Goethe's gift for privacy in the midst of apparent confessions. 'There were problematic, even predatory, undertones in the friendship of which both were aware, but both were more generous than their obscure emotions.' Goethe revises and extends and completes the first of his two Wilhelm Meister novels, writes lyric and meditative poems, the narrative poems Alexis and Dora and Hermann and Dorothea, makes what Boyle calls 'the decisive breakthrough' in his work on Faust, and pursues his anti-Newtonian colour theory. Boyle's theme is now renunciation rather than desire, although given the kind of desire we have been looking at, it's a little hard to tell them apart.</p> <p>And above all, something of the old, restless Goethe survives all kinds of apparent lapses into stasis. He is a courtier but still an artist, 'expert', Boyle says, 'at concealing his own modernity beneath the feudal forms'. He is fat and contented, but still inquiring and energetic. He is happy in love, and writes about his happiness, but he still sees love as a provocation rather than sheer comfort. Love is the same, he says in a poem, 'Wenn man ihr alles gew\u00e4hrt, wenn man ihr alles versagt' - 'if we grant it everything, if we deny it everything'. His Faust is a man who has 'undertaken never to rest in the contemplation of beauty', Boyle says. Or in anything else. 'His modern pact with the devil gives him access to every human experience, but only as an object of enjoyment from which he must detach himself in the moment of consuming it.' This is enjoyment as renunciation.</p> <p>There are lots of famous descriptions of Goethe at this time, and the ones Boyle quotes all catch something of this paradox - as if Goethe was a myth neither Goethe nor anyone could escape, and as if, miraculously, Goethe just was the person the myth said he was. 'His mouth is very beautiful, small, and extraordinarily flexible, only it is disfigured when he smiles by his yellow and extremely crooked teeth. When he is not speaking he looks thoroughly serious, but really not morose, and not a hint, not a trace of pomposity.' 'He has now lost almost all his Apolline slimness - His embonpoint expands by the day and his eyes are buried in the fat of his cheeks.

Wordsworth, 226 pp., \u00a32.99, 11 November 1999, 1 84022 115 1 Buy it at BOL The story so far is this. Johann Wolfgang (not yet von) Goethe, the prodigiously talented son of a prosperous Frankfurt citizen, startles his compatriots with a furious and rambling play, G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen (1771), which effectively inaugurates modern drama in Germany. He then writes The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774), a melancholy novel in letters, and becomes an immensely influential European figure, a provoker of fashions in dress and suicide, a sort of Byron before Byron. He is 25. Troubled by this success in print - G\u00f6tz was published to great acclaim but not staged for some time - Goethe seeks a different public and a different relation to the world. He moves to Weimar in 1775, where he becomes confidential adviser and then minister and privy councillor to the Duke. He is made a baron in 1782. Weimar at this time is a city of 6000 inhabitants, compared with Frankfurt's 36,000. But Weimar is also the centre of a duchy, which includes the territories of Jena, Eisenach and Ilmenau. It is a little world but it is a world. Goethe occupies himself with mines, politics, the development of the University of Jena. He starts several lengthy writing projects but finishes few, although at this time as at all times he writes remarkable poems in many genres. He becomes frustrated, both by the burdens of office and by the stranglement of what appears to have been a long Platonic affair with a married court lady, Frau von Stein. He longs to travel in Italy, a journey he has often imagined, and which he postponed when he came to Weimar. Finally, in 1786, he asks for and is given a leave of absence and takes off for the better part of two years, visiting Verona, Padua, Venice and Naples, and staying for some time in Sicily and (twice) in Rome. He finds a new life among German artists in Italy - 'artists' here means painters and sculptors, but Goethe, and Schiller soon after him, convert the word to something like its modern meaning, where it includes writers and film-makers, for example. 'I have found myself again,' Goethe writes to the Duke, 'but as what? - As an artist!' This is a declaration of independence of sorts, but Goethe knows he can't stay in Italy. He returns to Weimar, works again on his Faust, finishes other plays (Iphigenia in Tauris, Egmont, Tasso), elaborates an early version of his novel Wilhelm Meister, and publishes his Collected Works in eight volumes. He also grieves extensively for the warm, permissive South and his lost artist colony in Rome, but realises, on a brief return trip to Venice, that his future lies in Germany. Italy had been paradise, or rather a proof that paradise exists and can be abandoned. Goethe is happy with the sterner North, or says he is. 'The Duchess is well and contented,' he writes of his employer's mother's homecoming from her Italian trip, 'as one is when one returns from paradise. I am now used to it, and this time I was quite happy to leave Italy.' Used to his return, he means, and used to the absence from paradise. The words I have just quoted are the last words of the first volume of Nicholas Boyle's biography of Goethe. The date is June 1790, and other things have been happening in Europe, to which Boyle immediately turns in his new book. Germany at this time was far from a nation state - it was a confusion of duchies and principalities and free cities, shadowed by the rising power of Prussia and the continuing presence of Austria at the centre of a slightly rickety Holy Roman Empire - but it was full of national feeling, of stirrings and reachings towards a shared culture. Thought and literature travelled fast, and Boyle expertly evokes their journeys. He is emphatic that Goethe doesn't reflect or resemble his age; but equally emphatic that the writer and his age can be understood only if we look at them together. '\"The Age of Goethe\" is simply the series of literary and intellectual temptations which, as it happens, Goethe resisted.' Not so simply, perhaps; and certainly not just 'as it happens'. Boyle says at the outset of his first volume that 1749 to 1832, the period of Goethe's life, is not one age but several. 'To think otherwise is to diminish the man and to misrepresent the time - his time, and ours.' This must be true in the long run, and presumably will be seen to be true in Boyle's completed work. But his first volume, and even the second, show us a Goethe rather more associated with his age than not. It's true there are 29 years to go. Meanwhile, loyal to his overall idea but scrupulous about individual historical moments, Boyle keeps offering modest disclaimers. Werther has a 'uniquely close relationship to its public'. 'Goethe's personal experience at this time' - 1773 - 'was... approximating to, and becoming symbolically representative of, that of a whole generation'; 'Goethe at this time in his life, as never again, spoke directly from and to the situation of his contemporaries'; 'He was very soon seen as the most prominent representative of a movement. For once, this was not wholly a misapprehension.' Boyle's general argument seems to be that Goethe was quite different from his contemporaries, but more German than they were - or more attuned to German possibilities, inventor and citizen of a Germany that never quite happened. 'If Werther is the moment of his nearest identity with his public, Urfaust is the first major work in which he establishes the initial distance of his own subjectivity from that of his contemporaries which will be characteristic of all his subsequent writing.' Goethe is becoming Goethe as Boyle sees him, and 'initial distance' is the phrase which establishes the room for manoeuvre. Weimar allowed Goethe to live 'on the edge of centrality', and he settled there because 'with the unconscious sureness of a sleepwalker, perhaps, he was finding his way to the one place where he could bring the centre of gravity of his own life as close as possible to the political centre of gravity of what was destined to be the nation, while retaining the generously broad and multifarious conception of nationhood of his Strasbourg and Frankfurt years'. Quite apart from the edgy combination of 'sureness' and 'perhaps', this is an extraordinary proposition, less an explanation of Goethe's behaviour than an exposition of what the name 'Goethe' means, but none the less valuable for that. Goethe's 'universal genius', in this perspective, means not that he was a talented painter and wrote poems, plays, novels, satires, libretti, an autobiography, studies of plant life and a theoretical treatise on colour, having also effectively run a small country, directed a theatre, and established a university, but that he knew how to make the edge of centrality a centre of gravity. A mixed metaphor, but the mixture was his gift. Boyle calls his first volume The Poetry of Desire because a terrific yearning marks all Goethe's best work of this period. 'None but the lonely heart' is the traditional translation of 'Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt', a song Goethe gives to his character Mignon in Wilhelm Meister. Boyle calls this poem a 'half-strangled cry', and his literal version begins 'Only he who knows yearning', but even 'yearning' can't catch the world-emptying force of Sehnsucht, a longing which is more like a disease than a feeling, and whose very existence seems to deny the possibility of fulfilment. Italy complicated this emotion for Goethe, since it showed him that fulfilment, sexual and otherwise, was possible. The place that Mignon dreams of, in another song, 'the land where the lemon trees bloom, the golden oranges glow amid the dark leaves, a gentle wind blows from the blue sky, the myrtle stands motionless and the bay tree tall' (Boyle's translation), really does exist, is not just a Northerner's fantasy. What Goethe now denies is not the fulfilment of desire but the desirability of fulfilment. It is important in this perspective that satisfaction should actually be possible, just as sexual chances need to exist for celibacy to be a moral option rather than a plight. What Goethe learned in Italy, Boyle says, was 'where his true spiritual home lay - not, after all, in Mignon's Vicenza but in a land where only those who knew yearning could know what he suffered'. Not in Italy but in Germany, that is, though both places have become allegories of desire, and strange, exclusive ideas crowd into the very thought of the nation. What you need to be a German is not a passport but a proper sense of Sehnsucht. The last lines of the dedicatory poem called 'Zueignung', which opens Faust: Part One, are translated by John Williams as What I possess now vanishes before me, And what was lost alone has substance for me. Was ich besitze, seh' ich wie im Weiten, Und was verschwand, wird mir zu Wirklichkeiten. The English lines are graceful and sensitive, but a more literal rendering brings out the paradox more fully, the commitment to the permanence of fulfillable but unfulfilled desire. 'What I possess, I see as if at a distance/And what disappeared becomes reality for me.' There is still a mild ambiguity here, and even a literal translation is defeated by Goethe's crafty plural: 'becomes realities for me'. Did what disappeared become reality because it disappeared? Because the poet only thought it was there, and now needs it as a memory? That would be a familiar form of nostalgia, and must be an important part of what 'Germany' came to mean in what wasn't the age of Goethe. But the other reading, and the one most consistent with Boyle's entirely persuasive argument, is that real things are (still) possessed and have disappeared. The poet is saying that among the world's available realities only the disappeared ones are real to him now. This is not quite Proust's claim that the only true paradises are lost paradises, but it is close to his idea that significant realities are formed not only in the mind but always in the mind as well. Boyle writes in his second volume of 'the disappointments of fulfilled desire', but I'm not sure we have to go that far, or that we have to speak, as Boyle rather grimly does, of 'the prison of sated appetite'. Satisfaction would be enough, and not enough. We could be happy and also know that happiness isn't everything. Goethe worked on Faust for most of his life. A version of 1775-76, now known as the Urfaust, survives in a copy which was rediscovered only in 1887. He published Faust: A Fragment in 1790, and Faust: Part One in 1808. He finished Faust: Part Two just before he died. Williams's version includes Part One and the Urfaust, and a handful of additional scenes for the Walpurgisnacht episode in Part One. Among the very many things that could be said about this imaginative new translation - even the hardened offender is going to blanch a little at the thought of reviewing Faust - two seem to me to stand out. The first results from a combination of Williams's translating practice and a critical point made by Boyle. Williams mentions the 'huge variety' of metres and verse forms Goethe uses in the play, and, discussing 'Commentary of an Old Woodcut', Boyle remarks that 'English poetry, whose vehicle is the language of a profoundly class-conscious culture, lacks the middle tone between verse and doggerel in which this poem like most of Faust, is written.' Many people have wondered why it is so hard to get Goethe to sound even creditable in English, let alone like a major poet, and this is surely an excellent explanation at least for part of the difficulty. The trouble with the simple lyric poems may just be their extraordinary simplicity, and faced with the renowned '\u00dcber allen Gipfeln/ Ist Ruh,' Boyle just throws up his hands: 'There is little sensible that literary criticism can say about something so delicate and so matchless.' I'm sure this is right, and I'm not going to say anything sensible or otherwise right now. But I do think literary criticism ought not to give up so easily. And it does seem plausible that even in the age of Wordsworth, English couldn't get close enough to knockabout comedy to use popular verse to real effect. When men spoke like men speaking to men, they spoke slowly and wisely. We might think that in Eliot's Sweeney Agonistes English was still trying, and not quite achieving, Goethe's 'middle tone'. Of course the stuff still sounds like doggerel in English, but it's possible to imagine something that is not doggerel lurking behind it. Take these lines from the opening of the Urfaust: Medicine, and Law, and Philosophy - Even, God help you, Theology; You've worked your way through every school And sweated at it like a fool... These jars and cases row on row, Retorts and tubes and taps and gauges, The useless junk of bygone ages - This is the only world you know! 'God help you' is a good rendering of leider, 'unfortunately', and 'sweated at' is a genuinely idiomatic version of heisser M\u00fch, 'hot care'. Of course nothing in English will quite catch the despair in the last line, heightened rather than diminished by the sense of doggerel and the amazing pantomime word vollgepfropft. 'That is your world, that is what they (or you or anyone) call a world.' Hab' nun ach die Philosophei Medizin und Juristerei Und leider auch die Theologie Durchaus studiert mit heisser M\u00fch'... Mit Gl\u00e4sern B\u00fcchsen rings bestellt Mit Instrumenten vollgepfropft, Uhrv\u00e4ter Hausrat drein gestopft, Das ist deine Welt, das heisst eine Welt! The other thing that struck me in reading Faust: Part One and the Urfaust back to back, along with Boyle's excellent comments on the whole Faust project, is the shift in Faust's passions, ambitions, faults, temptations. Obvious and familiar enough to Goethe scholars, I'm sure, but a mixture of a memory and a revelation to me. The figure in the Urfaust makes no pact with the devil, not because Goethe didn't plan one but because he didn't write the scene. The effect, however, is to convert Mephistopheles into the agent not of some malign power but of Faust's own more cynical thoughts. Not only his shadow, as Boyle says, but something like his negative conscience, the part of his mind which will not tolerate the Wertherian sentimentality of the rest. To put it too crudely, once Faust launches into his romance with Gretchen, he thinks he can seduce an innocent maiden and remain a nice fellow, indeed a romantic hero, rather than a skunk, and Mephistopheles is under no illusions on this score. Gretchen herself, in her distrust of Faust's companion, could be read as intuiting the other side, or even the real truth, of the man she loves. 'How you can live with him I just don't know,' she says. I even think, whenever he is here, My very love for you might ebb away, And I could never pray when he is near. wo er mag zu uns treten, Mein' ich sogar ich liebte dich nicht mehr. Und wenn er da ist k\u00f6nnt' ich nimmer beten. Gretchen's last words, apart from her calling of Faust's name, are 'mir grauts vor dir', well translated by Williams as 'you horrify me,' although grauen has an additional suggestion of 'fear' and 'shivers' and 'creeps'. It is Faust who horrifies her, as well as Mephistopheles. The hero of Faust: Part One is a fullblown thinker and poet, a one-man conversion of the Enlightenment into the Romantic Movement. He is tired of learning, rapturously contemplates suicide, is brought back to life by memory, 'the feelings of childhood'. He has fabulous, famous lines, and Mephistopheles is no longer a version of the reality principle but a goad to desire, the cold instrument of endless heat, an indispensable aid to unfulfilment: But now I see that we can never know Perfection here on earth. For with this bliss That brings me ever closer to the gods, You gave me that cold and insolent companion From whom I can no longer free myself, Who makes me feel my shame and my disgrace, And turns your gifts to dross with every breath. He fans the flames that burn within my heart, And fires my longing for that lovely form. I satisfy desire with pleasure, then In pleasure languish for desire again. O, dass dem Menschen nichts Vollkommnes wird, Empfind' ich nun. Du gabst mir zu dieser Wonne, Die mich den G\u00f6ttern nah und n\u00e4her bringt, Mir den Gef\u00e4hrten, den ich schon nicht mehr Entbehren kann, wenn er gleich, kalt und frech, Mich vor mir selbst erniedrigt, und zu nichts, Mit einem Worthauch, deine Gaben wandelt. Er facht in meiner Brust ein wildes Feuer Nach jenem sch\u00f6nem Bild gesch\u00e4ftig an. So tauml' ich von Begierde zu Genuss, Und im Genuss verschmacht' ich nach Begierde. The deity being addressed here is the Earth Spirit, whom Faust once conjured up but found 'too terrible'. Williams doesn't quite manage to get the hectic energy of Faust's complaint, his restless eagerness for what he says he doesn't want. The German has him 'tumbling' from desire to pleasure, the very image of the intellectual released into the life of the senses. And Faust doesn't say he can't free himself from his cold companion, he says he can't do without him. And of course this Faust makes a complicated pact with Mephistopheles, which effectively reveals the devil as the instrument not only of desire but of a God who will sanction anything in the name of desire. In a Prologue in Heaven, God says 'man will err as long as he can strive,' but he (or Goethe) means or comes to mean the opposite: a man who keeps striving can't go wrong. Among the last words of Faust: Part Two, delivered by an angel carrying off Faust's immortal soul, are these: 'Wer immer strebend sich bem\u00fcht,/Den k\u00f6nnen wir erl\u00f6sen' - very roughly, 'Whoever takes pains to keep striving/Is someone we can redeem.' The terms of Faust's pact are, as everyone says, one of the key formulations of a modern morality - 'the morality of modernity itself', Boyle suggests. Faust proposes: If I should ever choose a life of sloth or leisure, Then let that moment be my end!... If I should bid the moment stay, or try To hold its fleeting beauty, then you may Cast me in chains and carry me away. Werd' ich beruhigt je mich auf ein Faulbett legen, So sei es gleich um mich getan!... Werd' ich zum Augenblicke sagen: Verweile doch! du bist so sch\u00f6n! Dann magst du mich in Fesseln schlagen, Dann will ich gern zugrunde gehen. It's a spectacular wager, but in Goethe's world the devil hasn't got a chance. There are all kinds of risks in a long biography, but two seem to stand out: that of turning all molehills into mountains, and that of just plodding, when not even molehills are available, through the days and hours of a life. Boyle doesn't entirely avoid the first risk, although there aren't too many molehills to start with, but he triumphantly avoids the second through the sheer intelligence of his writing, the firmness of his focus on the Goethe he has in mind. He also has the great knack of turning what is often thought of as cultural or historical background into vivid foreground, so that his sections on Kant or Schiller or H\u00f6lderlin or Hegel or Fichte, for example, read like the intellectual adventure they represent, and his account of the Prussian military campaign against the French Republic, on which Goethe accompanied his Duke Carl August, is as harrowing as a harsh war movie. Over half the army now was infected with dysentery, between the tents lay the bloody excreta of those unable to reach the latrines in time, the latrines themselves were nauseating with blood and matter, and a plague of lice broke out... Dead horses were left to clog the ditches, human arms and legs protruded from the hasty and shallow graves, and Goethe saw a wounded horse, which no one could be bothered to shoot, entangling itself in its own entrails. The Bastille falls in Boyle's second volume, and, as he says in his first sentence, the world changes. By the end of the book Napoleon is in power, and we are seeing what Boyle calls 'the beginning of the long postponed demolition of old Germany'. Somehow in the turmoil of Europe, Goethe manages to settle down into a de facto marriage to Christiana Vulpius, frowned on and snickered at but finally accepted by aristocratic Weimar. He and Christiana have a child, and four more children are either stillborn or die very early. Goethe's friendship and partnership with Schiller, who lives in Jena - they edit a journal together, closely discuss each other's work - develops at this time, and Boyle has many shrewd things to say about Schiller's understanding and misunderstanding of Goethe, and about Goethe's gift for privacy in the midst of apparent confessions. 'There were problematic, even predatory, undertones in the friendship of which both were aware, but both were more generous than their obscure emotions.' Goethe revises and extends and completes the first of his two Wilhelm Meister novels, writes lyric and meditative poems, the narrative poems Alexis and Dora and Hermann and Dorothea, makes what Boyle calls 'the decisive breakthrough' in his work on Faust, and pursues his anti-Newtonian colour theory. Boyle's theme is now renunciation rather than desire, although given the kind of desire we have been looking at, it's a little hard to tell them apart. And above all, something of the old, restless Goethe survives all kinds of apparent lapses into stasis. He is a courtier but still an artist, 'expert', Boyle says, 'at concealing his own modernity beneath the feudal forms'. He is fat and contented, but still inquiring and energetic. He is happy in love, and writes about his happiness, but he still sees love as a provocation rather than sheer comfort. Love is the same, he says in a poem, 'Wenn man ihr alles gew\u00e4hrt, wenn man ihr alles versagt' - 'if we grant it everything, if we deny it everything'. His Faust is a man who has 'undertaken never to rest in the contemplation of beauty', Boyle says. Or in anything else. 'His modern pact with the devil gives him access to every human experience, but only as an object of enjoyment from which he must detach himself in the moment of consuming it.' This is enjoyment as renunciation. There are lots of famous descriptions of Goethe at this time, and the ones Boyle quotes all catch something of this paradox - as if Goethe was a myth neither Goethe nor anyone could escape, and as if, miraculously, Goethe just was the person the myth said he was. 'His mouth is very beautiful, small, and extraordinarily flexible, only it is disfigured when he smiles by his yellow and extremely crooked teeth. When he is not speaking he looks thoroughly serious, but really not morose, and not a hint, not a trace of pomposity.' 'He has now lost almost all his Apolline slimness - His embonpoint expands by the day and his eyes are buried in the fat of his cheeks. Only when he reads from Voss's Iliad is his figure transformed.' Fichte said: 'One might imagine him to be treacherous; but he is certainly not that; he is without predicates.' 'His appetite for food is appalling,' Jean Paul wrote. 'He dresses with the most exquisite taste... He is a volcano, outwardly snow-covered, inwardly full of molten matter... At last not just the champagne but the conversation about art, the public etc made him blaze up and - we were with Goethe.' \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

The scheme would place less emphasis on training and much more on preparing the jobless for the disciplines of work, such as turning up on time. The proposal which would place a question mark over the government's employment service, has been prepared by the Conservative Employment spokesman John Bercow with the help of US Republicans. Private contractors would receive a fee of \u00a31,500 for each unemployed person they take on with a bonus of a further \u00a31,500 if the contractor kept the unemployed person in the same job for six months or more. The Conservatives claim this fee would be sufficient to cover the wage to the client as well as the contractor's profit. The scheme would cover the New Deal programmes for young people, the New Deal for those aged over 25 and for the long-term unemployed. The proposal will be one of a number of radical ideas to be submitted to a special shadow cabinet away day in London today convened by William Hague. The shadow cabinet will endorse what is being described as a pre-manifesto which will then be put to a vote of the full party membership with the result announced in September, just before the party's annual conference. Tony Blair sought a similar party membership endorsement for his programme before the 1997 general election. Tory spokesmen believe the Government's New Deal, financed by a windfall levy on the profits of utility companies, has been proven as an expensive failure.

News footage showed policemen pulling Thomas Jones, 31, from a hijacked patrol car after a high-speed chase and shootout. They forced Mr Jones, who by then had several bullet wounds, to the ground, and about a dozen officers gathered around, kicking him and stamping on him. He was in hospital yesterday in a \"fair\" condition, with wounds to his abdomen and arms. A policeman wounded in the hand during the incident was said to be in a good condition. The justice department said it would carry out an investigation. Philadelphia's civic leaders also promised a full investigation and appealed for calm, playing down parallels with the notorious beating of the black motorist Rodney King by the Los Angeles police in 1991. A bystander's video of the incident and the subsequent acquittal of four white police officers sparked race riots. \"For people to start making comparisons to Rodney King, I just think is outrageous,\" the police commissioner, John Timoney, said. \"He [Mr Jones] is resisting throughout.

But the city's discomfort under national scrutiny in the run-up to the Republican convention, which begins on July 31, was evident.

A number of policemen tried to subdue him, but a fight ensued in which shots were fired. Mr Jones was wounded but climbed into an empty police car. When a policeman tried to turn off the ignition, Mr Jones shot him in the hand, and sped off once more. The second car chase ended about a mile away when the police surrounded the patrol car, pulled Mr Jones out and began assaulting him.

A group of black leaders visited the mayor and the police chief yesterday to express their concern. Jerry Mondesire, head of the Philadelphia branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, said afterwards: \"We . . . strongly believe that this was a case of excessive force. \"Officers were seen jumping over their cars to kick and stomp Mr Jones, who had already been wounded multiple times by police weapons.\" The Rev Vernal Simms, president of the Black Clergy of Philadelphia and Vicinity, said race clearly wasn't an issue. \"We saw the tape; we saw that there were as many black officers kicking and punching and jumping as white,\" he said. \"We are not questioning that.

      "bodyText": "The US defence secretary found his visit to China turning slightly precarious yesterday when his hosts took the American administration to task for Israel's cancelling the sale of spy-plane equipment to Beijing. Though William Cohen arrived on Wednesday to an honour guard in Tiananmen Square and smiles from his Chinese counterpart, Chi Haotian, the press followed up yesterday by branding the US \"a threat to world peace\". Members of Congress in Washington had threatened to cut the huge amount of US aid which underwrites Israel if Tel Aviv went ahead with the sale of a Phalcon advanced airborne radar system to the Chinese army. The US says that the equipment would enable China to monitor Taiwan's military defences and could be used against American planes in the Taiwan Strait. In Beijing yesterday the foreign ministry declared: \"No other country has the right to interfere in bilateral cooperation that China has with other governments.\" Mr Cohen's group revealed that President Jiang Zemin had also complained about the cancellation when he met Mr Cohen later yesterday, although they said Mr Jiang refrained from naming the US as the party responsible for it. \"It certainly was a concern to China that the sale was cancelled,\" Mr Cohen told reporters after meeting Mr Jiang at Zhongnanhai, the Communist party leadership's compound. China is offended not only because it has lost the tech nology, but also because - as Mr Chi, the defence minister, once again asserted - China believes it has the right to use force in the last resort against Taiwan. It insists, at the same time, that it would prefer a peaceful solution to what it sees as the problem of Taiwan's independent status. Mr Cohen's talks in Beijing have been dominated by what a US official called the \"heartburn issue\" of Taiwan. China has also pressed its opposition to America's plans for a national missile defence screen - the so-called star wars system - which Bejing sees as reducing the power of its own nuclear deterrent. \"In reality,\" the official People's Daily said, the US \"aims to disable the offensive capabilities of its major strategic rivals, namely Russia and China, and establish its superiority in the world.\" In Beijing, Mr Cohen has found himself treated on the one hand to assurances that the Chinese want a constructive relationship, and on the other to expressions of fear and threat. The fear is that Washington may be tempted to seek \"hegemony\" in the world. The threat - as repeated by warnings in People's Daily - is that unspecified \"counter-measures\" may be taken by China if the US missile project goes ahead. Washington refuses to rule out the possibility that a missile defence system it is discussing with Japan might be extended to Taiwan if the island came under threat. Mr Chi told Mr Cohen he hoped that the US would not send \"the wrong signals\" to the Taiwan authorities.",

      "body": "<p>From the pimply, sweaty miseries of Todd Solondz's Happiness to Harmony Korine filming himself being beaten up, realist film has returned to contemporary cinema with a vengeance. Nowhere is this more evident and more successful than in the new Iranian cinema with the triumph at western film festivals of films like The White Balloon and The Apple. </p> <p>In fact there has never been a national school of film that so exclusively staked its appeal on reality as contemporary Iranian cinema - not since the heyday of Italian neo-realism anyway. The films from Iran that reach the west are drastically lacking in fantasy. They are fixated on the small-scale, the intimate and the inconsequential. Kiarostami's Taste of Cherry, with its potential suicide driving around meeting people, is about as eventful as it gets. </p> <p>Other recent Iranian films that have won awards and been shown successfully in the west include Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven - nominated for a best foreign film Oscar last year - about a boy who loses his sister's shoes on his way back from the cobbler's; the same director's forthcoming The Colour of Paradise, about a blind boy's summer holiday; and the Kiarostami-scripted The White Balloon, directed by Jafar Panahi, about a girl who loses her money on her way to buy a goldfish. </p> <p>The world of Iranian cinema is centred on courtyards off narrow Tehran backstreets, with gates and pools of fresh water and several flats where families live close together. The natural heroes of this small world, defined by family and immediate locale, are children.</p> <p>Abbas Kiarostami, Iran's outstanding talent, has moved on from his early children's films of the 70s and 80s, including Where is My Friend's House?, an elementary story of a boy trying to return a notebook to a school friend from which all the recent child-centred Iranian films are derived. But he has said that his entire sense of cinema is shaped by his experience with children: \"I try to look at the world from a child's point of view.\" </p> <p>In one scene in Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven, a brother and sister sit at the pool in the courtyard over which they live in a small flat. They blow bubbles which float out over the pool in a scene that might make you think of the European realist painter Chardin's Boy Blowing Bubbles. It might also make you wonder why it is always children that film-makers turn to when they try to depict reality. </p> <p>One obvious reason is because they behave in a spontaneous way before the camera and children tend to be less self-conscious than adults. Ever since Italian neo-realist film-makers started working with untrained actors in the 40s, children have been the stars of the everyday. They are naturals at being natural. Think of Vittorio de Sica's Bicycle Thieves - in which the young boy played by Enzo Staiola steals every scene he is in; or the performance by David Bradley in Ken Loach's Kes. </p> <p>Iranian film-makers are now coaxing this calibre of performance from child actors. It's harder with adults. Majid Majidi has recalled that when he filmed The Colour of Paradise, the old villager he cast as the grandmother had trouble remembering her lines; Mohsen Ramezani, the equally untrained actor who plays the film's eight-year-old blind hero, had to coach her. The two girls in Samira Makhmalbaf's The Apple who have been locked in the house for years and are let out, grinning and loping about the streets of Tehran, are re-enacting their own experiences.</p> <p>But Iranian film-makers are not only interested in children for their acting - or anti-acting - abilities. Children have a different sense of time to adults. Time is more elastic, more flexible, less subject to the rational world of the clock. It's one of the ways we define childhood and it's the essence of children's play. Play stretches time, like the boy blowing the bubble. It holds the everyday in suspension. Film can do that too. </p> <p>The most popular Iranian hit of the 90s, Panahi's The White Balloon (1995) with a script by Abbas Kiarostami, makes time's passing explicit. At the beginning, and at intervals throughout the film, we hear a radio announcer counting down to the Islamic new year. But for the seven-year-old heroine of the film, this time means nothing; her mother tells her off for wanting to receive and give away her presents before new year and the day only has meaning to her as a chance to buy a goldfish.</p> <p>We get caught up in her sense of what is important; the child actress perfectly suggests the right kind of self-absorption and when she loses her money down a grid in the road we and she think only of how she can get it back before the pet shop closes. </p> <p>The White Balloon is a primer in cinema. The perfect, very pure state of suspense it causes is worthy of Hitchcock. It dramatises the passivity and powerlessness of the spectator; it makes you feel like a child. Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut teased out of Hitchcock in his interviews with the director that his cinema had its roots in his Catholic childhood. The White Balloon may be a sweet film, but it is also a highly self-conscious one which implies that all cinema is about being put in the situation as a child, watching the world but having no control over it. Adults are an immovable force in contemporary Iranian films. </p> <p>This makes them very different from Europe's child-revolution films; there is no equivalent for Vigo's Z\u00e9ro de Conduite or Melville's Les Enfants Terribles, no children living in a utopia free of adults. The distant, sometimes cruel, sometimes merciful, always unquestionable authority of adults in these films is a given. The suspense of The White Balloon arises from our empathy with the girl's terror of having to tell her mother she has lost her money while In The Colour of Paradise, a blind boy's desire to be loved by his father pervades everything. </p> <p>This depiction of adult power has, consciously or unconsciously, a political content. Made in a country with an authoritarian religious government, Iranian child films are at one level a way of getting through the strict censorship that limits the way film-makers can deal with adult subjects. Making us identify with the powerlessness of children is a profound way of engaging with the nature of life in such a society; a world where everyone feels as helpless as a child. </p> <p>Samira Makhmalbaf, director of The Apple, explicitly interpreted the youthfulness of Iranian cinema as politically subversive when she spoke at Cannes this year after getting the jury award for her second film. She dedicated her award to \"a young generation of hope\" involved in a \"struggle for democracy... and a better life in Iran\".</p> <p>The daughter of the Islamic film-maker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, she made The Apple when she was just 17. It has a rough-and-ready spontaneous look. The children begin by groaning and growling instead of talking, and we see their gradual liberation as they play in the street for the first time, make friends and eat ice cream. </p> <p>Censorship in Iran since the 1979 revolution has severely limited the depiction of \"adult\" subjects - particularly the lives of women. Time magazine, in a feature on children in the new Iranian cinema, saw The Apple as a thinly-veiled attack on the mullahs, with the children representing young Iran rejecting religious oppression. But if these films get under the net of censorship at home, they get under the net of our prejudices too. We can watch them without having to engage with their being thoroughly Islamic. </p> <p>The difference in what we see and what an Iranian audience might is demonstrated by The Colour of Paradise, Majid Majidi's follow-up to Children of Heaven. Things that appear universal are constantly colliding with those that are culturally specific. The Colour of Paradise is about a boy, played by blind child actor Mohsen Ramenazi, whose father cannot see past his disability to love his son. We see Mohsen's passion for life, his physical engagement with the world, and recognise that he \"sees\" the beauty of existence far more than his father. </p> <p>The pleasure of this film for a western audience is entirely to do with Mohsen's performance, his amazing vitality, his playfulness, his wit. As a result, most of the symbolism in the film goes right over our heads. The Colour of Paradise is deeply theological; it's an Islamic tract. \"The film's Iranian title is The Colour of God,\" the director has explained, \"which alludes to the intervention of God at the end. God changes the father and touches the son.\" </p> <p>Iranian film-makers now lead the way in world cinema. And they are doing it, as Europeans once did, by showing that you can make a film by simply pointing a camera at a child walking down the street.</p> <p>\u0095 The Colour of Paradise is out on August 4.</p>",

On July 14 1789, the people of Paris rose up and decided to march on the Bastille, a state prison which symbolised the absolutism and arbitrary nature of the Ancien Regime. 4. L'\u00e9tendard sanglant est lev\u00e9! Bastille Day is one of the founding myths of the French Republic and a national symbol, along with the tricolour flag, the Marseillaise, Marianne and the Gallic rooster. 5. Entendez-vous dans les campagnes mugir ces f\u00e9roces soldats? A solemn military parade is traditionally held on the Champs Elys\u00e9es and broadcast live on television, although to most people, the July 14 holiday provides an excuse for dancing and firework displays. 6. Ils viennent jusque dans nos bras \u00e9gorger nos fils et nos compagnes! But this year, as part of the millennium celebrations, a giant picnic has been organised to commemorate the introduction of the metric system - hailed as one of the great achievements of the revolution. A 625-mile feast called la m\u00e9ridienne verte will be held along the line of the Paris meridian which cuts across France. 7. Aux armes, citoyens! The revolution, of course, wasn't all singing and dancing. The guillotine also featured heavily. 8. Formez vos bataillons! La Marseillaise was composed in one night during the French revolution on April 24 1792 by Claude-Joseph Rouget de Lisle, a captain of the engineers and an amateur musician who was stationed in Strasbourg in 1792. 9. Marchons! Marchons! It was played at a patriotic banquet at Marseille, and printed copies were given to the revolutionary forces then marching on Paris. They entered Paris singing this song, and to it they marched to the Tuileries on August 10. 10. Qu'un sang impur abreuve nos sillons! If you want to celebrate in the UK, your first port of call should be the French embassy website.",

      "byline": "Hadley Freeman",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If high fashion is about aspiration, then haute couture presents the truly fantastical. Ranging from the breathtakingly beautiful to the ridiculously implausible, haute couture allows both designers and their fantastically wealthy customers complete freedom with their fashion imaginations. Fancy a hat four feet tall, twisted and gnarled to resemble a young elm tree? No problem. How about a puff dress, splattered with black paint? Baby, you got it. But, best of all, these clothes are specially made for the customer and are measured to fit his or her body perfectly. Not that all this lavish care and attention comes cheap: haute couture is arguably as famous for its gawp-inducing price-tags (\u00a3250,000 for a gown is not impossible) as it is for the beauty of its creations. So although the high street has recently become a veritable marvel when it comes to providing cheap copies, the rarefied, elitist world of haute couture has remained locked away from the former's derivative hands. Until now. At the end of the summer, Top Shop is launching a made-to-measure service, through which the customer can design, using a selection of available fabrics, a garment that will be ready within 24 hours. Already, there is a customisation outlet at its Oxford Street branch in London and around the corner at Levi's flagship store, you can have your denim customised to your wishes with anything from beading to hand-painting to changing the entire shape of the garment for anywhere from \u00a35 to \u00a3100. \"We are trying to achieve individuality in a mass market,\" explains Jane Shepherdson, brand director of Top Shop. \"There is an increasing desire for individual and exclusive styles, and it is no longer enough to offer racks of clothes. We need to inject a little more excitement and creativity into the ranges.\" Top Shop is owned by high street monolith the Arcadia Group, which also shelters Principles, Burton, Evans and Dorothy Perkins beneath its ever-expanding wing. Although there are currently no plans to extend the made-to-measure service to the other stores, Shepherdson says this will, if the scheme at Top Shop is a success, \"certainly be considered\". And about time, too. The high street, inevitably, has a tendency to homogenise fashion. What was once a seemingly outrageous idea, such as applying feathers to cropped trousers or beading to cardigans, becomes a little monotonous when it is seized by the mass market and flogged into fashion oblivion. What we wear is a form of self-expression, so who wants to look the same as everyone else? Part of the appeal of haute couture is the interaction between the designer and the consumer, without the depersonalising barrier of the store. In this respect, the internet lends itself particularly well to this idea of lower priced couture. Recently launched accessories website TheRedHand.com allows browsers to choose from a selection of one-offs by one of the site's young British designers or, if none takes your fancy, to email the designers your preferred style, which will cost you anywhere between \u00a318 and (rarely) \u00a3350. \"The internet provides a great avenue for designers and customers to communicate with each other,\" says the website's communications manager, Tiffany Wright. \"Maybe in Hollywood the multimillionaire movie star can have this kind of contact when commissioning their dress for the Oscars, but this just doesn't exist for real people.\"</p> <p>Such an arrangement has benefits for designer and customer. \"The problem with the high street if you're a young designer is that you really have to sell out and sacrifice your individuality to what the store and mass market want,\" Wright says. \"Here, the emphasis is on individuality and keeping things unique. This allows customers to have what they really want and designers to keep to their vision.\" Such a concept is timely. The current popularity of the so-called Vintage Look, in which eccentric thrift store finds are teamed with ethnic apparel and more mainstream clothes, is undoubtedly a response to the homogenity of the high street. Shepherdson readily admits that this is what inspired their customisation and made-to-measure services. \"I'd noticed that many of our customers like to individualise their clothes and mix and match designer and secondhand with Top Shop to create a style of their own,\" she explains. \"We had already experimented with detailed denim and silk scarves from China and India. The garments sold out within hours, so we realised we had something that was enormously in demand.\" Thanks to celebrity customers such as Sadie Frost (who wore a vintage gown to the Oscars, providing a nice respite from the sea of stylised sleekness) and Kate Moss, London's markets, including Portobello, are at last being recognised as fashion treasure troves. Tellingly, Top Shop, Levi's and The Red Hand all found their designers at these markets or at fashion schools: at last the more mainstream high street is acknowledging the growing popularity of more eccentric, individualised styles. Now that we live in a world of mass production, in which people in China, Australia and Poland are wearing the same Gap T-shirt as you, the allure of personalised attention is undeniable. Nor is this service limited to clothes. As with clothing, scent is an evocative form of self-expression, so why be restricted by what's on the market? For \u00a3500, customers can have a perfume designed for them at Miller Harris in west London, made of ingredients that, says perfumer Lyn Harris, \"translate who you are into scent\". Alternatively, you can try to catch Sarah Horowitz on one of her infrequent visits to Harrods where you will get a similar service for \u00a3295, thereby guaranteeing that you will stand out amid a sea of cKOne. And if you think this all sounds a bit steep for a bit of olefactory pleasure, just compare it to the \u00a340,000 haute couture customers shell out to legendary perfumer Oliver Creed for their own signature scent. Nevertheless, there are qualms. After all, it is difficult to see how the quick and cheap philosophy that underpins high street shopping is compatible with the quality and attention to detail that lies behind the world of haute couture. As with high street copies, the point is the similarity to the world of high fashion, with quality inevitably being of a lesser standard. \"The essence of the service will be the speed in which we can produce the garment,\" Shepherdson emphasises. Immediate gratification, instant fashion cred, Hollywood star treatment - even within the notoriously precarious and fickle world of mass market fashion, this is one idea that looks set to last well into next season and beyond.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Leicestershire village of Queniborough is at the centre of a major investigation into the human form of mad cow disease after it emerged that three people there have died of the illness. Junior health minister Lord Hunt told the House of Lords last night that there are four confirmed cases and one probable case of new-variant CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) in Leicestershire, out of only 75 nationwide. Two of the victims of the disease, Stacey Robinson and an unnamed victim, had lived in Queniborough, a village of 2,297 inhabitants just north of Leicester. Another, Pamela Beyless, of Glenfield, was a frequent visitor to the village. All three died in 1998. In May, when a 19-year-old man died at the Leicester royal infirmary, health officials said it was \"highly probable\" that a 24-year-old man in the county also had the disease. \"Statistical experts advise it is unlikely that the higher number of cases in Leicestershire will have occurred by chance,\" Lord Hunt revealed in a written answer in the House of Lords. The Department of Health has launched an investigation into the disease \"cluster\" in the area, working with experts from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the national CJD surveillance unit and the London school of hygiene and tropical medicine. Health officials in Leicestershire have discovered two factors which play a part in contracting the disease - genetic susceptibility and exposure to the infection. But they stressed that villagers should not worry, because the connection between the cases was more likely to be genetic than geographical. \"It is unlikely these cases are linked geographically - rather it was the victims' genetic susceptibility,\" said Dr Philip Monk, a consultant in communicable diseases at Leicestershire health authority. \"We are now interviewing the relatives of the victims to try and establish what common connection they may have had.\" \"When you have got five people who live in a close area, we have a much greater chance of finding the common factor.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Swanton's wartime Wisden becomes a museum piece</strong></p> <p>One of the late EW Swanton's most coveted possessions is about to go on public display for the first time, at Lord's. It's a softback copy of the 1939 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack which sustained the spirits of the great cricket writer in the three-and-a-half terrible years he spent in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp during the Second World War. The book was also much pored over by fellow prisoners.</p> <p>\"My 1939 Wisden,\" Swanton wrote later, \"was the solace (<em>sic</em>) and in such demand that it could be lent out only for periods of six hours.\" Swanton added that it might be \"the most read copy of Wisden ever published\".</p> <p>\"Jim\" Swanton, who died in January, aged 92, left no specific instructions about the 1939 Wisden, but his literary executors, John Woodcock and George Plumptre, have decided it should go to the MCC Museum at Lord's. \"It's the obvious place,\" says Woodcock, former cricket correspondent of The Times. \"It's a book of enormous interest and great value. I'm sure it will give a lot of pleasure.\"</p> <p>The '39 Wisden, which should go on show at Lord's in time for the one-day final on July 22, won't be instantly recognisable: because of its eventful life, it has been rebound several times. \"It's a strange and unique item,\" says Stephen Green, the museum's curator. \"I think it must have been one of the prisoners' lifelines to sanity.\"</p> <p><strong>The day Trescothick reached 4000 runs - off the last ball of the season </strong></p> <p>Marcus Trescothick's confident start to his England one-day career comes as little surprise to those who remember his feats as a schoolboy. As a 15-year-old, Trescothick amassed no fewer than 4000 runs, at an average of 68, in the summer of 1991, when his new opening partner Alec Stewart was already in the England team. His rich form was displayed for a variety of sides: the West of England, Avon Schools, Somerset youth teams, and the youth and first XIs of his local club, Keynsham, near Bath. </p> <p>\"Marcus seemed to get century after century,\" says his father, Martyn. \"He had a golden year.\" Martyn and his wife Lin, who were at The Oval and Lord's last weekend to see their son's 79 against Zimbabwe and 49 against West Indies, can't remember quite how many centuries Marcus collected in 1991, but they think it was at least ten. That's the number recorded on a special certificate presented to him by his then sponsors, the Classic Bat Company, well before the triumphant season was over.</p> <p>It had a suitably dramatic climax. Trescothick started his last match, a friendly for Keynsham firsts, needing 85 to reach the magic 4000. Batting at No. 3, he had to watch the openers put on 170, and only got to the wicket with 20 overs left. Some ferocious hitting got him to 83 with one ball of the innings remaining. \"Marcus ran it off the bottom edge to the keeper, and they ran one,\" recalls his dad. \"The keeper shied at the stumps, and missed, and they ran an overthrow. So Marcus finished 85 not out.\"</p> <p><strong>Zim players double their money</strong></p> <p>Zimbabwe's dominance in the early part of the one-day series may owe something to the fact that, of the three teams, they have the sharpest financial incentive to do well. Under a hitherto unknown bonus scheme introduced this year, the Zimbabweans' match fees are doubled if they win a Test or one-dayer. If they win the one-day final - for which they have already qualified - match fees for that game will be trebled. </p> <p>Strong incentives for individual performances have also been introduced. These apply to any player reaching 50, taking three wickets or three catches in a Test or one-day innings, and are increased for those reaching other landmarks (a century, five wickets etc). David Ellman-Brown, chief executive of the Zimbabwe Cricket Union, says: \"We believe that team and individual bonuses help maximise performance.\" </p> <p>It's true, of course, that the tourists are being paid a good deal less than they'd like for the three-month trip to England, and that the early weeks were disrupted by a bitter pay dispute with the ZCU. Ellman-Brown says his players are being paid much more than the reported \u00a33000 basic for the tour, though he won't disclose figures. Nor will he say how much extra the average player has so far earned in performance-related bonuses. </p> <p>Those three straight wins also ensured Zimbabwe a clean sweep of the prize money available in the first few games: \u00a330,000 (\u00a310,000 per victory) plus \u00a34500 for three Player of the Match Awards (\u00a31500 each). That's very big money in their terms.</p> <p>England and West Indies still have a strong incentive to turn things round. Not only is there that prize money on offer, but England are on a team bonus from the ECB of \u00a310,000 per win in the qualifying stages, with an extra \u00a370,000 for a tournament victory. </p> <p>West Indies pick up no bonuses for qualifying wins, but a series victory would bring their players US$50,000 (\u00a333,333) from the tour sponsors. And don't forget that whichever of the three teams wins the tournament will collect an additional \u00a320,000 in prize money. </p> <p><em>Charles de Lisle is the author, with Christopher Martin-Jenkins, of An Australian Summer: The Story of the 1998/9 Ashes Series (Faber).

      "bodyText": "Swanton's wartime Wisden becomes a museum piece One of the late EW Swanton's most coveted possessions is about to go on public display for the first time, at Lord's. It's a softback copy of the 1939 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack which sustained the spirits of the great cricket writer in the three-and-a-half terrible years he spent in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp during the Second World War. The book was also much pored over by fellow prisoners. \"My 1939 Wisden,\" Swanton wrote later, \"was the solace (sic) and in such demand that it could be lent out only for periods of six hours.\" Swanton added that it might be \"the most read copy of Wisden ever published\". \"Jim\" Swanton, who died in January, aged 92, left no specific instructions about the 1939 Wisden, but his literary executors, John Woodcock and George Plumptre, have decided it should go to the MCC Museum at Lord's. \"It's the obvious place,\" says Woodcock, former cricket correspondent of The Times. \"It's a book of enormous interest and great value. I'm sure it will give a lot of pleasure.\" The '39 Wisden, which should go on show at Lord's in time for the one-day final on July 22, won't be instantly recognisable: because of its eventful life, it has been rebound several times. \"It's a strange and unique item,\" says Stephen Green, the museum's curator. \"I think it must have been one of the prisoners' lifelines to sanity.\" The day Trescothick reached 4000 runs - off the last ball of the season Marcus Trescothick's confident start to his England one-day career comes as little surprise to those who remember his feats as a schoolboy. As a 15-year-old, Trescothick amassed no fewer than 4000 runs, at an average of 68, in the summer of 1991, when his new opening partner Alec Stewart was already in the England team. His rich form was displayed for a variety of sides: the West of England, Avon Schools, Somerset youth teams, and the youth and first XIs of his local club, Keynsham, near Bath. \"Marcus seemed to get century after century,\" says his father, Martyn. \"He had a golden year.\" Martyn and his wife Lin, who were at The Oval and Lord's last weekend to see their son's 79 against Zimbabwe and 49 against West Indies, can't remember quite how many centuries Marcus collected in 1991, but they think it was at least ten. That's the number recorded on a special certificate presented to him by his then sponsors, the Classic Bat Company, well before the triumphant season was over. It had a suitably dramatic climax. Trescothick started his last match, a friendly for Keynsham firsts, needing 85 to reach the magic 4000. Batting at No. 3, he had to watch the openers put on 170, and only got to the wicket with 20 overs left. Some ferocious hitting got him to 83 with one ball of the innings remaining. \"Marcus ran it off the bottom edge to the keeper, and they ran one,\" recalls his dad. \"The keeper shied at the stumps, and missed, and they ran an overthrow. So Marcus finished 85 not out.\" Zim players double their money Zimbabwe's dominance in the early part of the one-day series may owe something to the fact that, of the three teams, they have the sharpest financial incentive to do well. Under a hitherto unknown bonus scheme introduced this year, the Zimbabweans' match fees are doubled if they win a Test or one-dayer. If they win the one-day final - for which they have already qualified - match fees for that game will be trebled. Strong incentives for individual performances have also been introduced. These apply to any player reaching 50, taking three wickets or three catches in a Test or one-day innings, and are increased for those reaching other landmarks (a century, five wickets etc). David Ellman-Brown, chief executive of the Zimbabwe Cricket Union, says: \"We believe that team and individual bonuses help maximise performance.\" It's true, of course, that the tourists are being paid a good deal less than they'd like for the three-month trip to England, and that the early weeks were disrupted by a bitter pay dispute with the ZCU. Ellman-Brown says his players are being paid much more than the reported \u00a33000 basic for the tour, though he won't disclose figures. Nor will he say how much extra the average player has so far earned in performance-related bonuses. Those three straight wins also ensured Zimbabwe a clean sweep of the prize money available in the first few games: \u00a330,000 (\u00a310,000 per victory) plus \u00a34500 for three Player of the Match Awards (\u00a31500 each). That's very big money in their terms. England and West Indies still have a strong incentive to turn things round. Not only is there that prize money on offer, but England are on a team bonus from the ECB of \u00a310,000 per win in the qualifying stages, with an extra \u00a370,000 for a tournament victory. West Indies pick up no bonuses for qualifying wins, but a series victory would bring their players US$50,000 (\u00a333,333) from the tour sponsors. And don't forget that whichever of the three teams wins the tournament will collect an additional \u00a320,000 in prize money.

Apart from the gravitas and the dignity, what sort of essential American qualities do you think he saw in you?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> How can you say apart from the gravitas and the dignity because that's all he means?! I am not sure how he got from wherever he got from to Abraham Lincoln, but I don't even know how, I can't even begin to answer.</p> <p><strong>Q1:</strong> Do you think there is anything specifically American in you that he sees?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Well, no. Because I don't have any other experience, I've travelled a lot, but I am essentially American. All my input has been American, it has not been Abraham Lincoln. I don't have the same feeling about Abraham Lincoln as you might do. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> You're a pretty good president in Deep Impact, you know, that moment when you say 'Hello America' I believed you. </p> <p> <strong>Q2:</strong> Can you imagine any situation where you might go back on the stage?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Yeah. I can imagine a situation. </p> <p><strong>Q2:</strong> And could you explain what the situation might be?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Well we are constantly looking for something new to do. I've always said I wanted to do King Lear and I was at one point going to do it at the Shakespeare Festival, in the park. That was the last play I did, Shakespeare. Now, I've been doing movies non-stop for years and I'm getting what actors seem to get - lazy. Stage is really hard work. You've got to do it every night. Not like doing it once and walking away. If you do it, you've got to commit at least six months to it [makes snoring sound]. So, if a good, new - y'know Driving Miss Daisy was a play, first. I saw it even before it was written - I was at Playwright's Horizon to see another play and on their little calendar was a little blurb about coming events. The coming event was this play by Alfred Uhry about a Jewish woman and her chauffeur in Atlanta, periods of 1960 to whatever, over a period of 25 years. And I thought: \"Oh, that looks good\" and it came to pass that I did that. Something new, something exciting, I think that is what I would be drawn back by. </p> <p> <strong>RJ:</strong> He's just worked with the playwright Neil LaBute, people think of him as a film-maker, but he is essentially a playwright before he was a film-maker. The director of A Company of Men and Friends and Neighbors. In his new piece [Nurse Betty], which is something very special. Give us an indication of what he was like to work with - because he didn't write this, did he?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Neil has been like a kind of teddy bear. He is kind of a large man and he's warm, cuddly and huggable. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> That's not very evident in his work</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> No, it's not. But he's sort of a minch. Is that the right word? He's easy going, he doesn't tense up about stuff. There's a sense of smooth, easy, lots of laughs. When we're kicking back and having fun, we're doing the work. It's flowing. I loved him. I have this feeling for him. I have seen two of his movies - and ooph. But this movie was kind of a departure, but in the same kind of dark vein that he likes to work in. I'm an easy lay, I guess I can say that. </p> <p> <strong>Q3:</strong> Have you any plans to work with Gene Hackman again? - the two of you on screen blows my mind.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> We don't make plans. All actors say, \"Let's do it again,\" but the chances are slim, or none that you will do it again, but it does happen. We do move round in circles like that and sometimes we intersect again. And of course if the opportunity ever presents itself, Gene and I will doubtless leap at it. </p> <p> <strong>Q4:</strong> What was it like to see yourself on screen for the first time? <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan6.RA\">sound clip 6</a> ]</strong></p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Good question. The answer is not what you think. I pretty much cut my teeth, that is, I grew up on the stage. The big difference is that on the stage I see me through you. I see me through the audience. You are my reflection of my work and I always walk away from the theatre expanded. I'm fantastic, I'm really good. Then you do a film. And now you see yourself and you're not so good. I thought I looked better than that, now you all become liars, I cannot trust you, because I know. The big fear is that one day, you're going to know. </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> That was a good answer, wasn't it? It was the truth. I cannot stand watching myself. I can, y'know, it's not nearly the same. It's humbling to watch yourself, to see yourself up there.</p> <p><strong>Q4:</strong> Are you talking about performance or your grey hair?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I am talking about everything - the performance, what I look like - I don't have to look, if I stand up and some lady goes: \"Ooh\". My whole thing changes. . .</p> <p> Q5: Is there anyone that you really want to work with that you've missed?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Oh yeah. Anybody. I don't want to call out any names because I may leave out the main ones, but whomever that you can think of that I have not worked with is who I want to work with. </p> <p> <strong>Q6:&lt;/B There's a lot of noise in the UK at the moment about the movie The Patriot - any thoughts?</strong></p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I haven't seen it and I don't know anything about it.</p> <p> <strong>Q7:</strong> Is there any politics involved as to why you were nominated for an Oscar for Shawshank but didn't get it? <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan7.RA\">sound clip 7</a> ]</strong></p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> No. No politics or stories at all. The problem with the Academy Awards, and to me it's a big problem, is that if you don't win it, you lose it. I think in all cases, the Academy - you've got a vote and sometimes you can't really separate it. So you might toss a coin. You might go on the fact that you know this actor longer than you know that one. You might go on the fact that you've seen this one in more pictures. I don't think it has anything to do with race. </p> <p> <strong>Q8:</strong> What are your favourite films?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I don't know, Riders of the Purple Sage. Anything. I think I was maybe 15 years old when I saw John Wayne as Kurt Evans in Angel and the Badman. I don't like John Wayne today, but when I was 15, he was what was happening to me. The first movie that I remember was King Kong. It always has this mythic place in my memory. Moby Dick was a book I read, one of the two books I read, that turned into a movie that was as good, but I wasn't a child then. When I went to movies when I was a kid, I had people I liked and whatever those people were in. . . and those people: Jay Maynard, John Macbrown, Jimmy Wakely - do you know who these people were? My point. But they were Saturday cowboys. (Makes shooting noises), that was the soundtrack, man. Horses never walked, they would run all day. Six-shooters could shoot 18 times. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> What were you saying yesterday that there were movies you really liked?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Dead Man Walking, American Beauty - anything I was in. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Enough of that.</p> <p> <strong>Q9:</strong> Aside from directing and acting, is there any other part of film-making you would like to do? Costume?</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Is it time for Morgan Freeman the costume maker? That is a great question!</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> You got close, I married one. No, I'm sidling, inching, into producing. Which will be an easy move for me because I have this incredible partner who was really born to produce, so I just sort of tag along with her and get credit. That's if I have any other career. . . I am probably going to move further and further into that aspect of it.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> I even saw that you're producing the new David Fincher movie. Big hundred million dollar sci-fi flick.</p> <p> <strong>Q10:</strong> Are you going to do some comedy? 'Cause you're really funny! </p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> My dignity. . . My persona as a dignified, wise, fatherly (grandfatherly perhaps) doesn't lend itself in that direction - so first comedy chance I get of course, I'll be right out there. I think my next movie [Nurse Betty] might be billed as comedy.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> It's a two-hander - with Chris Rock, and a must-see.</p> <p> <strong>Q11:</strong> Have you met Nelson Mandela, and how do you feel about playing him?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Yes I have and Mr Mandela and I have a pact that whenever we are within a thousand miles of each other that we will get together because I need to spend as much quality time with him before I play him on film. I need to know him very well, and he understands that and so we get together as often as we can. We just had dinner in Washington DC about a month ago - the other part of your question was what?</p> <p><strong>Q11:</strong> How do you feel about playing him?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Oh, I'm honoured and terrified that I won't live up to the job of really presenting this man. Ben Kingsley as Ghandi sort of bench-marked that for us. If you don't do at least that good, maybe you should stay at home. So. . . it's a serious challenge, but I am really looking forward to it. One of the best directors around is going to direct it, [Elizabeth director] Shekhar Kapur, so I think we're going to come out of that alright.</p> <p> <strong>Q12:</strong> The character in Street Smart [a pimp]- do you think you'll ever do a character like that again?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I'll never do that one again. No. <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Freeman/morgan8.RA\">sound clip 8</a> ]</strong> The problem that finding something like that, you know what happened behind Street Smart is that every script that I got after that was like, that. People say, if you do something well, then the people who send you scripts say 'This is right up your alley, this is what you do well'. It's a strange kind of compliment, because it really isn't a compliment. That's not what I do well, I do everything well. I mean, I'm an actor. That's not me, don't send me a script saying 'I wrote this with you in mind'. No you didn't. You wrote it with a character in mind. Maybe something you saw me do, but it's not me. So don't do that. Write a script and say that maybe you'd like Morgan Freeman to try and play this - but you can't write it with me in mind. </p> <p><strong>Q13:</strong> Are there any more characters you'd like to play?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> No, I've done it. That's it, I'm over. What do you mean?</p> <p><strong>Q13:</strong> Is there anyone else you'd like to portray?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Oh, is there an Abraham Lincoln somewhere in my future? After Mandela you mean? He wrote a book about his thing and he said that he would like for me to play it. Will it happen again? I don't know. I am not dying to play just historical characters, but I do very much like historical material because I think that I for instance, know that I am informed about history through books and movies. You can teach me more I have some concept of, having seen it in the movies or read about it in a book, than you can if I have not. The danger is always that in Hollywood we tend to rewrite history to match what we need to say. Which means that it's no longer history, it's somebody's fiction. But pictures like Glory, where we strove mightily to be accurate, I think are important and I like to do those. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> You're also going through a period where you're making choices which are way out there, I mean, working with Neil LaBute is a new kind of challenge and you're both distinguished. . . and I don't think that anyone believed what I was saying earlier about the character in Moist, which in itself tells you quite a lot about the movie, doesn't it? Can you tell us what that character is, in Moist.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> It's a wonderful concept. The character that I play is an international thief. Right now he's busy stealing sperm and eggs because people are stock-piling it for later use and so if there was a millionaire who wants, for instance, Richard's sperm, and I know that he's got some stored up. . . I could get it for you wholesale. That's the premise of the movie.</p> <p> <strong>Q14:</strong> I teach American History and I try to use Glory but I often get quite negative reactions from parents and administrators (because of the violence of the battle scenes) - do you have any advice as to what I can say to them?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> 'Yes Sir' or 'Yes Ma'am'. The kids will go back and they will slow it down when they get home or y'know. There may be differing reasons why parents would not want them to see that, other than the ones you and I would jump at.</p> <p> <strong>Q15:</strong> It says in our programme notes that you did long takes (of seven or eight minutes) for Under Suspicion. Is that for real, and was it hard work?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> That's for real and because it's dialogue driven, it was easy to do like that. Because Under Suspicion is essentially a play, they don't need a lot of cuts and uh - We're aware that there is a lot of close-ups in films by people who've done television. Small screens seem to demand that immediacy, whereas a film doesn't, a film can sustain a tableau. If you have a scene that you can choreograph as a tableau so that the scene is seamless; then, number one, you're going to save time and time is money; and number two, you're going to be more immediate in your story without a lot of jumps and things. And I think it's helpful, did you find it that way? Yes.</p> <p> <strong>Q16:</strong> Why did you choose not to star in Bopha! as well as directing?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Number one, I felt very strongly that Danny Glover was the better choice of actor for the role. I am not one who thinks he can do everything and survive, and that was the case for Bopha! Number two, I was not ready to try to direct myself in my first effort at directing. I didn't want to. It's very difficult, I think. Well, that's primarily it. I didn't want to play the lead. If I hadn't directed, I wouldn't have played the role.</p> <p> <strong>RJ:</strong> If I can ask one final question - of all your body of work, what's the one that you're most proud of? I know you feel very good about a lot that you've made, you've made that very clear tonight, but -</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> Most proud of Glory. My favourite character is in Street Smart and everything else is just work. I'm not downplaying it, it's y'know -</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> You can look at a lot of other actor's careers, and you could say, I mean, Gene Hackman, I'm obviously a huge fan of, but you look at some of the choices that Gene's made and you think, 'What was he thinking about doing this film?' He's never bad in those films, 'cause he's too good. But he's made some seriously weird choices of movies - I mean he's been in some real crap.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I think you can punch Gene Hackman right along with Michael Caine. Michael says, 'It's work and I'm an actor, so, sure, I'll do it'. It's a paycheque. And like you say, they're never bad, so why not? </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> But you never regarded it in that way?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> No, if I hate the script I'm never going to get past that fact. No.</p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Do you think you're still pushing the boat out, do you think you've learnt new things, you're trying new things still?</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> I'm always trying new things and learning new things. Once you think you've got it all, you should lie down. If there isn't anything more you can learn - go off and die. </p> <p><strong>RJ:</strong> Don't do that on us, because I think we've had a pretty amazing evening in your company tonight and I think it's been a great honour sharing the stage with you.</p> <p><strong>MF:</strong> You've all been, let me tell you, extraordinarily wonderful.

Q1: An American critic recently wrote that you would be the perfect casting for Abraham Lincoln. Apart from the gravitas and the dignity, what sort of essential American qualities do you think he saw in you? MF: How can you say apart from the gravitas and the dignity because that's all he means?! I am not sure how he got from wherever he got from to Abraham Lincoln, but I don't even know how, I can't even begin to answer. Q1: Do you think there is anything specifically American in you that he sees? MF: Well, no. Because I don't have any other experience, I've travelled a lot, but I am essentially American. All my input has been American, it has not been Abraham Lincoln. I don't have the same feeling about Abraham Lincoln as you might do. RJ: You're a pretty good president in Deep Impact, you know, that moment when you say 'Hello America' I believed you. Q2: Can you imagine any situation where you might go back on the stage? MF: Yeah. I can imagine a situation. Q2: And could you explain what the situation might be? MF: Well we are constantly looking for something new to do. I've always said I wanted to do King Lear and I was at one point going to do it at the Shakespeare Festival, in the park. That was the last play I did, Shakespeare. Now, I've been doing movies non-stop for years and I'm getting what actors seem to get - lazy. Stage is really hard work. You've got to do it every night. Not like doing it once and walking away. If you do it, you've got to commit at least six months to it [makes snoring sound]. So, if a good, new - y'know Driving Miss Daisy was a play, first. I saw it even before it was written - I was at Playwright's Horizon to see another play and on their little calendar was a little blurb about coming events. The coming event was this play by Alfred Uhry about a Jewish woman and her chauffeur in Atlanta, periods of 1960 to whatever, over a period of 25 years. And I thought: \"Oh, that looks good\" and it came to pass that I did that. Something new, something exciting, I think that is what I would be drawn back by. RJ: He's just worked with the playwright Neil LaBute, people think of him as a film-maker, but he is essentially a playwright before he was a film-maker. The director of A Company of Men and Friends and Neighbors. In his new piece [Nurse Betty], which is something very special. Give us an indication of what he was like to work with - because he didn't write this, did he? MF: Neil has been like a kind of teddy bear. He is kind of a large man and he's warm, cuddly and huggable. RJ: That's not very evident in his work MF: No, it's not. But he's sort of a minch. Is that the right word? He's easy going, he doesn't tense up about stuff. There's a sense of smooth, easy, lots of laughs. When we're kicking back and having fun, we're doing the work. It's flowing. I loved him. I have this feeling for him. I have seen two of his movies - and ooph. But this movie was kind of a departure, but in the same kind of dark vein that he likes to work in. I'm an easy lay, I guess I can say that. Q3: Have you any plans to work with Gene Hackman again? - the two of you on screen blows my mind. MF: We don't make plans. All actors say, \"Let's do it again,\" but the chances are slim, or none that you will do it again, but it does happen. We do move round in circles like that and sometimes we intersect again. And of course if the opportunity ever presents itself, Gene and I will doubtless leap at it. Q4: What was it like to see yourself on screen for the first time? [ sound clip 6 ] MF: Good question. The answer is not what you think. I pretty much cut my teeth, that is, I grew up on the stage. The big difference is that on the stage I see me through you. I see me through the audience. You are my reflection of my work and I always walk away from the theatre expanded. I'm fantastic, I'm really good. Then you do a film. And now you see yourself and you're not so good. I thought I looked better than that, now you all become liars, I cannot trust you, because I know. The big fear is that one day, you're going to know. MF: That was a good answer, wasn't it? It was the truth. I cannot stand watching myself. I can, y'know, it's not nearly the same. It's humbling to watch yourself, to see yourself up there. Q4: Are you talking about performance or your grey hair? MF: I am talking about everything - the performance, what I look like - I don't have to look, if I stand up and some lady goes: \"Ooh\". My whole thing changes. . . Q5: Is there anyone that you really want to work with that you've missed? MF: Oh yeah. Anybody. I don't want to call out any names because I may leave out the main ones, but whomever that you can think of that I have not worked with is who I want to work with. Q6:",

      "body": "<p>Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's chief executive, yesterday accepted responsibility for huge delays caused by its \"truly dreadful'' \u00a35.8bn upgrade of the west coast main line. The delays caused by work on the approach to Euston station in London are causing disruption up the line as far as Glasgow, particularly at weekends. Railtrack faces legal action from Virgin Trains and other train operators to recoup up to \u00a310m.</p> <p>Making his grovelling apology to thousands of listeners to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Corbett said: \"I'm afraid it's been truly dreadful, and it has been largely down to us and our contractors. We are trying to do a hell of a lot of work and the way we have been doing it has not been good enough. I am very sorry about that.'' Mr Corbett's confession came as the shadow strategic rail authority released nationwide figures showing that train punctuality is getting worse: 80% of the 25 rail companies ran a worse service between April and June this year, compared with the same three months last year.</p> <p>Mike Grant, the SSRA's chief executive, said: \"These are disappointing results and demonstrate the urgency of the rail franchise renewal process we are embarking on.'' Mr Corbett was forced into an admission that Railtrack was in a dire plight after bitter criticism from Chris Green, Virgin Trains' chief executive. He said that the work at Euston was rather like having in a builder who randomly switched off electricity, water and gas.</p> <p>Asked if he was offering any defence, Mr Corbett replied: \"No, not really.'' Asked if anybody should be sacked to put the project back on track, he said: \"Absolutely. And we have got our best team on the job and we have to get it right, and it's not acceptable.''</p> <p>The pain is greater for Mr Corbett, who uses the line every day from his home near Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. \"It therefore gives me a particular interest,'' he said. But he declined to offer his own resignation. Mr Green, who has given Railtrack 28 days to come up with plans to rescue the project or face legal action, said: \"The level of existing disruption to passengers on existing trains is quite unacceptable, and we've just got to stand up and say so.''</p> <p>He laid the blame on Railtrack and its contractors. \"We don't expect them to be breaking wires, breaking pipes, setting up electrification systems with no electricity in them which then cause massive delays to innocent passengers.''</p> <p>Mr Corbett praised Railtrack for presenting the Virgin Trains board with a 30- point plan to improve the situation. \"If they can, the passengers get a normal railway again. If they can't, I'm afraid it's 'see you in court' because this is really serious stuff.''</p> <p>Robin Gisby, a Railtrack senior executive, added his apologies but pointed out that Railtrack had been compensating Virgin and other companies by between \u00a38m and \u00a39m for its failures. Over the next month, Virgin could expect to receive an extra \u00a3500,000 in compensation.</p> <p>Virgin said it was mystified by the figures. They did not match up to anything it could understand. Passengers delayed by more than one hour were given a 25% reduction on their next fare and a 100% reduction if the delay was more than two hours.</p> <p><b> Climate </b> <br> Mr Corbett later risked the further wrath of passengers by blaming delays in services on the British climate. Answering questions from shareholders, he said: \"The target is to deliver a railway that does not freak out with the weather. We do have the wrong kind of weather. It is the biggest cause of Railtrack's delays.\"</p> <p>Reflecting problems caused by continuing fluctuations in the weather, Mr Corbett said: \"I am afraid that a terribly wet day can cause problems. Equally very hot days can cause some rails to buckle. On one hot day last month, we had three days' delay in one.''</p> <p>For good measure, Railtrack also blamed a 34% increase in delays on increasing suicides. The company was unable to say how many, but said that they occurred at \"busy times of the day and at busy junctions''.</p> <p>The annual meeting ended with new horticultural revelations about burgeoning buddleia at the side of railway lines and their threat to safety. It is a problem that is causing Chris Leah, Railtrack's head of safety, sleepless nights. He conceded that British Rail's old style \"slash-and-burn'' tactics had been much more successful. BR also used harsher chemicals to get rid of the buddleia scourge, but tighter environmental regulations prevent their use. \"We are not removing the buddleia fast enough. We have to do more,'' he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's chief executive, yesterday accepted responsibility for huge delays caused by its \"truly dreadful'' \u00a35.8bn upgrade of the west coast main line. The delays caused by work on the approach to Euston station in London are causing disruption up the line as far as Glasgow, particularly at weekends. Railtrack faces legal action from Virgin Trains and other train operators to recoup up to \u00a310m. Making his grovelling apology to thousands of listeners to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Corbett said: \"I'm afraid it's been truly dreadful, and it has been largely down to us and our contractors. We are trying to do a hell of a lot of work and the way we have been doing it has not been good enough. I am very sorry about that.'' Mr Corbett's confession came as the shadow strategic rail authority released nationwide figures showing that train punctuality is getting worse: 80% of the 25 rail companies ran a worse service between April and June this year, compared with the same three months last year. Mike Grant, the SSRA's chief executive, said: \"These are disappointing results and demonstrate the urgency of the rail franchise renewal process we are embarking on.'' Mr Corbett was forced into an admission that Railtrack was in a dire plight after bitter criticism from Chris Green, Virgin Trains' chief executive. He said that the work at Euston was rather like having in a builder who randomly switched off electricity, water and gas. Asked if he was offering any defence, Mr Corbett replied: \"No, not really.'' Asked if anybody should be sacked to put the project back on track, he said: \"Absolutely. And we have got our best team on the job and we have to get it right, and it's not acceptable.'' The pain is greater for Mr Corbett, who uses the line every day from his home near Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. \"It therefore gives me a particular interest,'' he said. But he declined to offer his own resignation. Mr Green, who has given Railtrack 28 days to come up with plans to rescue the project or face legal action, said: \"The level of existing disruption to passengers on existing trains is quite unacceptable, and we've just got to stand up and say so.'' He laid the blame on Railtrack and its contractors. \"We don't expect them to be breaking wires, breaking pipes, setting up electrification systems with no electricity in them which then cause massive delays to innocent passengers.'' Mr Corbett praised Railtrack for presenting the Virgin Trains board with a 30- point plan to improve the situation. \"If they can, the passengers get a normal railway again. If they can't, I'm afraid it's 'see you in court' because this is really serious stuff.'' Robin Gisby, a Railtrack senior executive, added his apologies but pointed out that Railtrack had been compensating Virgin and other companies by between \u00a38m and \u00a39m for its failures. Over the next month, Virgin could expect to receive an extra \u00a3500,000 in compensation. Virgin said it was mystified by the figures. They did not match up to anything it could understand. Passengers delayed by more than one hour were given a 25% reduction on their next fare and a 100% reduction if the delay was more than two hours. Climate Mr Corbett later risked the further wrath of passengers by blaming delays in services on the British climate. Answering questions from shareholders, he said: \"The target is to deliver a railway that does not freak out with the weather. We do have the wrong kind of weather. It is the biggest cause of Railtrack's delays.\" Reflecting problems caused by continuing fluctuations in the weather, Mr Corbett said: \"I am afraid that a terribly wet day can cause problems. Equally very hot days can cause some rails to buckle. On one hot day last month, we had three days' delay in one.'' For good measure, Railtrack also blamed a 34% increase in delays on increasing suicides. The company was unable to say how many, but said that they occurred at \"busy times of the day and at busy junctions''. The annual meeting ended with new horticultural revelations about burgeoning buddleia at the side of railway lines and their threat to safety. It is a problem that is causing Chris Leah, Railtrack's head of safety, sleepless nights. He conceded that British Rail's old style \"slash-and-burn'' tactics had been much more successful. BR also used harsher chemicals to get rid of the buddleia scourge, but tighter environmental regulations prevent their use. \"We are not removing the buddleia fast enough. We have to do more,'' he said.",

Just about everyone thinks it necessary these days to lay out their triumphs, complete with fulsome introduction from the chairman (how rarely chairwoman). Some beaming, all-purpose, middle-aged gent in suit astonishes us with the news that, yes, it really has been yet another very good year.</p> <p>Sadly, the government's annual report is much the same - a glib, misleading, filigree of fact and factoid wrapped up in layers of omission. It has all the credibility of, say, a report from the Robert Maxwell group of companies. It exudes the pleasingly airy unreality of an investment prospectus for some particularly shaky proposed new dot com. How about inyourdreams.UKplc.com? What is this utopia? Where is this magic realm where every citizen is happy, yes really smiling, in every single photograph? Every problem that isn't already solved is just about to be. Will the state soon have to wither away for lack of anything else to do? It is hardly surprising that the print-run has been drastically cut back this year. You just wonder what kind of tin-eared image-maker imagined that anyone could read this stuff and not want to hurl it across the room. The pensioner with 75p? The hard-pressed nurse or teacher? The patient waiting for an operation? It is patronising, dumbed down and reads like a North Korean beetroot crop report. The odd thing about all this is that anyone reading it would hazard a guess that such persiflage must disguise a host of dreadful failures, lapses, gaps and blunders. Not so. That is what's so crazy. The beetroot crop really was quite good. Far more important, beetroot futures are terrific, better than at any time in living memory.</p> <p>In his spectacularly confident and commanding Downing Street press conference on Wednesday, the prime minister set a very different tone, which had even enemy newspapers full of unaccustomed praise: \"By any standards Tony Blair had a remarkable story of success to tell yesterday. . .\" (Mail); \"Tony Blair turned the political tide. . .\" (Standard); \"Blair gets a grip\" (Sun); \"Tony Blair staged a spirited fightback yesterday\" (Telegraph). What was it that suddenly had these tigers eating out of his hand? Honest dealing, plain speaking and modesty about the good story he did have to tell. Still so far to go, he kept saying and they liked him all the better for it. He spoke of the future, of plans laid out, schemes afoot. He laid out the scale of the problem on issue after issue, never minimising the mountains to climb. He spoke of investing in the future. It was this theme he returned to yesterday in the Commons: \"investment, investment, investment\" is now added to his triple education pledge, alongside a repeated commitment to \"opportunity for all\". All this is convincing because his vision is underpinned by the very large sums of money no one can deny are at last pouring in.</p> <p>We may believe in the future, but a long list of achievements doesn't convince yet. We see the money but we see few results. A clever and far more honest part of the annual report includes a website where you fill in your post code and it tells you what the situation is on your own home ground. Here you get plain truth: in Lambeth I find six beacon schools doing well and five with \"serious weakness\". I find only marginally fewer patients waiting for operations while the numbers waiting for their first out-patient appointment has nearly trebled, pretty bad. I find there are fewer policemen than there were in 1997. But on the other hand, 4,400 families are now drawing working families' tax credit, (guaranteeing them at least \u00a3214 a week). All this confirms everything I see about me and I believe it. If and when things improve, I shall believe that too. I believe that the economy is going well, because I see signs of spending all around in shops and bars. But I also see signs of desperate poverty. Labour had better be careful about its promises on fairness and opportunity when all the signs are that it would take swingeing great income taxes on the richest to make any effect at all on the gap between rich and poor. Yesterday's official poverty figures made grim reading. Tony Blair speaks powerfully of \"Labour's programme of national rejuvenation\". But results take time.</p> <p>The rhetoric must never get ahead of the delivery: a good plan or good money spent is only input. Successful outcome is all that matters to the punter. For example, when the annual report claims \"Walk-in centres are sited on the high street, in shopping centres, in pharmacies - anywhere that's convenient for patients\", it makes me cross. There is no such thing anywhere in Lambeth, let alone in my high street. Meanwhile my local quite large GP clinic (Clapham Manor Health Centre, just to name and shame) is shut all evenings and weekends. My GP has no appointment free until August 7. I know how often Tony Blair protests at the user-unfriendly NHS: some walk-in centres are opening - but for most patients, so what? Any audience, be it the Tory press or the Women's Institute, can tell at once the difference between honesty and political cant. When Blair penned a dreadful speech to the WI, he got the bird. When, chasing after headlines, he threw out a bit of rubbish penal policy about locking up 4,000 more criminals, it was mocked for transparent opportunism as loudly by the law and order fanatics as by liberals. But when he threw himself open to any amount of questions, no prepared text, just straight eye-to-eye answers, he got well-deserved praise. The political speech, the manifesto, the annual report - they are all vain, boastful, intellectually insulting forms of discourse. Once off the set text, no politician dares use those pompous, high-flown phrases. That hollow moralising would make anyone blush in ordinary conversation. The election campaign has begun, the call to arms was sounded this week. On one side the Tory tax-cutting strategy is shaping up nicely to create a genuine ideological battle between the two sides. Theirs will be that old, low appeal to base wallets and handbags, a quick bribe and the devil take the hindmost: it has proven pulling power. On the other side Blair offers an inspiring vision of long-term social investment in the future. However, even on election day it may still be more promise than resounding delivery. Blair will need every ounce of trust he can muster, not to be squandered on unconvincing speeches or policies. Alastair Campbell says in Michael Cockerell's documentary tomorrow night: \"Over time, believe me, the real message of this government is going to get out, the real record of this government is going to get out.\" But from now on the message has to be low-key until people can see it all around them with their own eyes.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

WorldCom and Sprint were forced to abort their merger because of demands by the US justice department to divest Sprint's internet, long-distance and local telephone operations, leaving it only the mobile phone division. A day later the deal was further knocked back by Mario Monti, the European competition commissioner. WorldCom said the demands made by the US justice department would have eliminated the customer benefits and \"financial synergies\" which supported the proposal. Bernie Ebbers, chief executive of WorldCom, said: \"We very much regret that our merger with Sprint was not allowed to proceed. The benefits of this merger were clear and compelling.\" Sprint is the third largest long distance carrier in America and together with WorldCom and AT&amp;T the companies control 80% of that market. Regulators were concerned the merger would lead to less innovation and higher prices.",

Four million people have received personal invitations. Now only the weather can spoil a unique event - the July 14 Incredible Picnic. Part of the millennium festivities, the picnic needed months of state-backed planning and millions of pounds of business sponsorship. The meal will commemorate the introduction of the metric system 200 years ago, one of the republic\u0092s most lasting achievements, which is why Bastille Day was chosen for the one-off affair. Revolutionary surveyors devised the measure after travelling the length of the Paris meridian, a line of longitude running from Belgium to the Pyrenees, providing the continuous link for the north-south community meal which starts precisely at noon. Everyone, including tourists, will be welcome to bring along hampers and join the privileged guests whose towns and villages are cut by the meridian - Greenwich\u0092s rival for meantime until an international agreement less than a century ago reduced its status for navigation and timekeeping.

      "bodyText": "The European commission was yesterday accused of caving in to pressure from large US biotechnology firms after it signalled it would rush through a controversial proposal to scrap the current Europe-wide moratorium on approval of new types of genetically modified food. In an outburst which angered environmental activists, the commission said the time had come to accept that gm food did not pose a serious threat to public health and that new types of gm food should be approved. No new gm crops have been authorised for sale or use in the 15-state EU for around two years after public concerns about the safety of gm food prompted Europe's environment ministers to demand a stricter regulatory framework. But the commission yesterday vowed to do its utmost to push through a directive governing gm food which it claims is far tougher than its predecessor and will include provisions on the labelling and traceability of any new food approved. Although the content of the new directive has to be definitively approved by the European parliament and EU governments, it could become law by the end of the year, kick-starting the EU's moribund approvals system. In an unprecedented step, the commission is lobbying for the new directive to become law as soon as it is endorsed in Brussels, and thinks it cannot afford to wait for individual countries to implement its provisions, a process which could take a further two years. \"The scientific evidence that is available to all of us is that there is no scientific danger in any gm foods,\" David Byrne, the commissioner in charge of consumer protection, said yesterday. He acknowledged that many consumers did not want to buy gm products, but promised the new legislation was sufficiently rigorous to guarantee the safety of gm food as far as this was scientifically possible. Margot Wallstrom, the environment commissioner, added her voice to calls for urgent action and said doing nothing would leave the commission vulnerable to a rash of lawsuits from biotechnology companies. \"The moratorium is illegal and unjustified and we cannot stop advances in new technology by refusing to act,\" she said. The commission's proposals will be discussed this weekend when EU environment ministers meet in Paris. Greenpeace accused the commission of being in the pocket of US biotechnology giants such as Monsanto who are desperate to get their products approved in Europe. \"The commission is bowing to US threats with a proposal which flies in the face of current consumer and member state concern,\" spokeswoman Isabelle Meister said. A recent EU poll found that 66% of Europeans viewed GM food as a health hazard. Eighteen gm food products have been approved for commercial use in the EU.",

      "bodyText": "Airtours issued a profits warning yesterday but signalled its willingness to enter merger talks with its German rival C&amp;N. Shares in Britain's largest tour operator dropped by 17% after it revealed that profits could slump by up to \u00a360m from the \u00a3156m delivered last year. The holiday market is notoriously volatile and prone to over-capacity and much of the damage is being inflicted by its operations in contintental Europe rather than in Britain. The trading statement came as Airtours took full control of Frosch Touristik (FTi), a loss-making German travel company in which Airtours had held a 36% stake for the last two years. Tim Byrne, group managing director of Airtours, predicted that further consolidation would take place in the German market and made it clear that Airtours intended to take part in the action. After being blocked by regulators in its attempts to take over its British rival, First Choice, Mr Byrne has kept the door open for talks with C&amp;N, one of its main competitors in Germany. There were three big operators in Europe - Preussag, the German company which recently bought Thomson Travel, Airtours and C&amp;N - and it would be a \"good idea\" for Airtours to tie up with C&amp;N, he said. Quashing speculation that David Crossland, the chairman of Airtours - who owns a 10% stake - was standing in the way of a deal, Mr Byrne said that as a quoted company it would be \"honour bound\" to follow up realistic offers. Airtours described its bookings for this summer as \"very satisfactory\" at 18% up on last year, but its investment in new markets, particularly in Germany - and a reorganisation of its existing business -had dented its profits. The acquisition of FTi had cost \u00a325m while a reorganisation of its French, Belgian and Dutch operations was costing \u00a315m. In addition, changes in accounting rules cut profits by \u00a310m while the weakness of the euro against sterling reduced the profits of its Italian Costa Cruises business by \u00a35m when translated into pounds. The group is also trying to make cost savings of up to \u00a310m a year in Britain by centralising its operations in Rochdale. That move will result in one-off costs this year. Airtours' woes knocked the shares of other tour operators, including First Choice, which fell 8.5p to 122.5p, and Preussag. The latter is thought to be feeling the same kind of pain being experienced by Airtours in Germany, Europe's biggest market for holidays. Airtours shares ended at 254p, down 53p. Airtours admitted yesterday that it expected to incur \"substantial losses\" in Germany this year but Mr Byrne outlined plans to increase its exposure to the market, even though it is burdened with over-capacity. One target for co-operation is LTU, the large German leisure airline mainly owned by Swissair. It is described as a prime example of the over-capacity in Germany, with too many seats on many routes. FTi has doubled in size in two years and has 2.2m customers. It made a pre-tax loss of \u00a314.4m last year. By taking control of the group and installing new management, Airtours aims to stem the losses. Despite fierce competition in the travel industry, Airtours is in expansionary mode.

In a move that is likely to embarrass other nations, the country committed itself to faster, deeper and wider debt relief and suggested that in order to benefit from it countries would not necessarily have to undergo tough economic reform programmes. The initiative follows sustained public pressure for action and enables the Italian government to claim the moral high ground when it attends next week's G7 annual economic summit in Japan, where debt relief will be one of the main items on the agenda. By contrast, the US House of Representatives rejected on Wednesday most of the money Bill Clinton wanted for financing debt relief. A spokeswoman for Jubilee 2000, the global coalition of charities campaigning for debt relief, said the Italian legislation represented a distinct move away from HIPC, the heavily indebted poor countries initiative, the World Bank-International Monetary Fund debt relief programme. The new legislation commits Italy to cancelling a minimum of $4bn (\u00a32.67bn) and a maximum of $6bn of debts within three years of the passing of the bill and could allow up to 78 countries to qualify for debt relief rather than the 40 or so included in the present HIPC programme.

The two companies did not provide financial details, but the deal is expected to be a stock swap valued at about $10.5bn (\u00a37bn). Diageo has been under pressure to divest the food side of its business. In a trading statement issued on Tuesday, Diageo's group chief executive, John McGrath, said the spirits and wine business had performed strongly in the past year. However, Pillsbury's sales in North America were down about 2%, he said. Pillsbury's brands include H\u00e4agen Dazs, Green Giant and Old El Paso Mexican foods. Diageo's shares were down 12.5p, or more than 2%, to 599p in trading yesterday. Speculation about Pillsbury's future rose after Diageo announced in June that it was working on a part flotation of its Burger King subsidiary. Analysts said the purchase of Pillsbury could help General Mills reduce its dependence on the slow-growing cereals market. \"This gets General Mills more diversified and into some other areas which have a faster growth potential,\" said Prudential Securities analyst Jeffrey Kanter. \"In the end, you get a more powerful General Mills.\"",

The government was accused of \"sneaking out\" the embarrassing figures - which indicated that there were fewer poor people in John Major's last two years in Downing Street than under Mr Blair - on the same day as the third of Labour's annual reports to voters was launched in person by the prime minister in the Commons. Data from the department of social security revealed that the number of people living in households on less than half average income rose from 16.9% to 17.7%, as the incomes of the rich grew three times as rapidly as those of the poor. Underlining the root cause of the government's uneasy relationship with the elderly, the DSS figures showed the number of pensioners living below the poverty line rose from 2m to 2.4m - accounting for 80% of the increase. Steve Webb, the Liberal Democrat social security spokesman, said: \"I am not surprised that these damning figures have been sneaked out on the same day as the government's annual report.

      "bodyText": "Irish pop band the Corrs yesterday joined synthesiser maestro Jean-Michel Jarre in a high profile campaign against music piracy on the internet, aiming to alter a new European directive on the issue. The International Federation of Phonographic Industries (Ifpi) estimates that there are at least 25m illegal music files on the internet, with up to 1bn downloads every year. Jim Corr, guitarist, keyboard player and songwriter for the family outfit, argued that downloading music on the net without paying for the privilege was akin to theft. \"Most people would not dream of stealing a CD from their local record store. In the same way we don't think it's cool to go cyber shoplifting. \"In just an eight-hour period, over 18,000 illegal Corrs music files and over 17,000 Jean-Michel Jarre files were found on the internet.\" Jay Berman, Ifpi chairfman, called on Euro MPs and EU governments to tighten up the provisions of a European copyright directive which would allow people to make private copies of their favourite songs. \"There is nothing private about 200m people on the internet mass-producing your music. It is not private copying if businesses are making copies without the consent of the artist or the record company.\" Ifpi says some 600,000 music industry jobs are at stake and that the \u00a38bn European music industry lost almost \u00a31bn last year because of piracy. The head of Sony Music Europe said yesterday the battle between the record industry and music websites could be settled if downloaders ploughed cash into artist development. Paul Russell said it would be possible to accept companies such as Napster if they used their online advertising revenues to pay and promote their artists. \"If they came along and said 'We are smarter than you. We are going to sign up artists and we are going to invest in their careers and we are going put their music up and its free and we pay artists from advertising' If that was their position I could deal with that.\"",

      "bodyText": "Fiji's political crisis seemed far from over last night, despite the freeing of political hostages, the appointment of a new president, and plans by the rebels to hand over their weapons today and claim amnesty. The political system and the economy remained in turmoil. The New Zealand government said the country was slipping into anarchy, and Australia - deploring the rebels' credo of race-based politics - advised its 1,700 citizens registered with the high commission in Fiji to leave. Outside the capital, Suva, prisoners rioted and one man was shot dead. People taking advantage of the power vacuum to settle land disputes seized two more holiday resorts, yet another blow to the vital tourism industry which is now in ruins. Hotels in the islands report that their occupancy rate has fallen to 10%. The rebel leader, George Speight, released the last 18 of his hostages yesterday and the country's Great Council of Chiefs responded by appointing his nominee president. He is Josefa Ilo Ilo, a former vice-president . The drama began on May 19, when an armed gang invaded parliament and Mr Speight, announced that he had overthrown the first ethnic Indian prime minister in the name of indigenous Fijians. The gang took 27 people hostage, including the prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry, and members of his cabinet. Mr Chaudhry, who was forced to resign half way through his 56 days in captivity, was among the last 18 hostages released yesterday. The releases followed a deal reached on Sunday in which the military authorities, who took temporary control on May 29 to try to stop the violence and looting that broke out after Mr Speight's coup, accepted his demands. These were that the multiracial constitution should be scrapped, the democratically elected Mr Chaudhry should be formally overthrown, and Mr Speight and his henchmen should receive amnesty for any acts committed in their campaign to make indigenous Fijians paramount. After he was freed yesterday, Mr Chaudhry said he had a continuing role in politics and bore his captors no ill will, even though on one occasion they beat him up. Just before he was freed he hugged Mr Speight, and some of the hostage MPs and their captors were in tears. But it is unclear how Mr Chaudhry, a former trade union leader who was elected prime minister 14 months ago, can have any role in the government to be appointed by the new president, in which Mr Speight is expected to have an important role behind the scenes. \"My priority is that the nation must get back on its feet,\" Mr Chaudhry said. \"There are a lot of people there who have suffered because of what's [happened] and they're our priority.\" The Indian Fijians, whose forebears were brought to the islands by British colonialists more than a century ago, make up 44% of Fiji's population, although 67,000 fled overseas after two coups in 1987. Indigenous Fijians make up 51%. Now that the multiracial constitution is gone, many thousands of Indian Fijians from the educated middle class and business elite are expected to leave the country. It guaranteed them, among other things, a share of power in government. Amnesty International said it was gravely concerned that the abolition of the 1997 constitution left human rights inadequately protected. \"There are no human rights guarantees for the various people who have opposed the coup, as well as ethnic Indian Fijians,\" it said in a statement. \"These individuals have been subjected to threats of death or other forms of physical violence, and to attacks upon their person and property.\" The Australian prime minister, John Howard, welcomed the end to the hostage crisis yesterday but said his country was disturbed at Fiji's slide into race-based politics. \"This was a criminal act which denied a democratically elected government its constitutional right to govern in the interests of the people of Fiji,\" his statement said. \"The Australian government remains profoundly disturbed at the abrogation of the Fijian constitution and the racially based approach apparently being taken to future constitutional arrangements.\" His statement made no specific mention of the military authorities, but their acquiescence remains in doubt. One of the spokesmen for the armed forces confirmed yesterday that Mr Speight and his men would get amnesty. \"There may be a few processes that need to take place, with regard to the processing of this amnesty for him and his group, and those associated with the political crimes, so to speak,\" Major Howard Politini said. \"But yes, effectively he goes free.\" The head of the Trade Union Congress, Felix Anthony, said that people were still deeply worried about Fiji's political future. \"I think that there is going to be a fair bit of opposition as to what political decisions are being made now and what will be made in the next couple of days, not only from the Indian community but from the population at large, who cherish democracy and the rule of law,\" he said. The two-month hostage crisis has opened the door to civil unrest, a range of groups taking advantage of the disarray. The seizure of resorts by local groups caused the Australian authorities to urge travellers to defer their visits to Fiji. The groups responsible for the seizures say they were acting in support of Mr Speight's faction. But in reality they appear to be people taking matters into their own hands in pursuance of previous land disputes. The military authorities said yesterday that two more tourist centres - the Buca Bay and Rukuruku resorts - had been seized, bringing the total number to four. The other two are the expensive Laucala Island and Turtle Island resorts. The Fiji Hotel Association said it was concerned that there could be more copy-cat seizures by villagers making land claims. Another military spokesman, Lieutenent-Colonel Filipo Tarakinikini, said: \"There's still a lot of mopping up operations to be done throughout the country, and that's where the military will work in conjunction with the police to take care of all that.\"",

      "body": "<p>Al Gore's chance of overturning George W Bush's lead in the US presidential race now hinges on his choice of running-mate and on the timing of the announcement, increasingly alarmed Democratic insiders believe.</p> <p>With Mr Bush again stretching his national poll lead into double figures, Mr Gore aims to announce his Democratic vice-presidential choice earlier than previously intended, in an attempt to recapture the initiative.</p> <p>Mr Bush is expected to announce his running-mate on the eve of the Republican convention in Philadelphia, which starts on July 31. Mr Gore is hoping to unveil his vice-presidential choice on August 4, immediately after the Republican convention ends.</p> <p>The Gore camp hopes that this manoeuvre will help to seize the news agenda from his rival, minimise any post-Philadelphia poll boost for Mr Bush, and allow Mr Gore to arrive at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles on August 14 on an upswing.</p> <p>With the presidential campaign currently in a pre-convention season lull, both men are polishing their vice-presidential shortlists, a generally well-guarded backroom process which nevertheless provides hundreds of column inches of media speculation.</p> <p>Mr Bush's shortlist is being drawn up by his father's former defence secretary Dick Cheney, while Mr Gore's final selection will come from a list compiled by the former Clinton administration secretary of state Warren Christopher.</p> <p>Both men have been quietly interviewing the likely candidates before submitting their chosen finalists to a detailed personal vetting process, including their financial, tax and medical histories.</p> <p>By general consent, Mr Bush has a much stronger field of possibilities from which to choose, a reflection in part of the Republicans' advantage in having 30 state governors to choose from, compared with the Democrats' 18 (there are two independents), and 55 US senators compared with the Democrats' 45.</p> <p>Judging by his campaigning stance since the end of the primary contests, Mr Bush seems increasingly likely to opt for a Republican moderate to strengthen his claim to the electoral centre-ground, a decision which would anger many rightwing activists and enable Mr Bush to present his leadership as a break from the past.</p> <p>The current favourite on the Republican side seems to be Governor Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a decorated Vietnam veteran who is in favour of abortion rights despite being a Roman Catholic. A timely new poll yesterday showed that with Mr Ridge on the ticket, Mr Bush could carry Pennsylvania by 51% to 39%; without Mr Ridge, he would lead by only 44% to Mr Gore's 40%, uncomfortably close to the polling margin of error.</p> <p>Governor Frank Keating of Oklahoma is also widely tipped as a possible Bush \"soulmate\" nominee. The New Jersey governor, Christine Todd Whitman, another Republican moderate, is under consideration too, but is considered a longshot.</p> <p>Among senators, few believe that John McCain can be persuaded to join the Republican ticket, even if Mr Bush wanted him. Mr McCain's ally Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, though, is another matter: a smart pragmatist and another Vietnam veteran.</p> <p>Fred Thompson of Tennessee is another possibility, not least because he could embarrass Mr Gore in his home state.</p> <p>By common consent Mr Gore's choice is much more difficult.

      "bodyText": "Al Gore's chance of overturning George W Bush's lead in the US presidential race now hinges on his choice of running-mate and on the timing of the announcement, increasingly alarmed Democratic insiders believe. With Mr Bush again stretching his national poll lead into double figures, Mr Gore aims to announce his Democratic vice-presidential choice earlier than previously intended, in an attempt to recapture the initiative. Mr Bush is expected to announce his running-mate on the eve of the Republican convention in Philadelphia, which starts on July 31. Mr Gore is hoping to unveil his vice-presidential choice on August 4, immediately after the Republican convention ends. The Gore camp hopes that this manoeuvre will help to seize the news agenda from his rival, minimise any post-Philadelphia poll boost for Mr Bush, and allow Mr Gore to arrive at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles on August 14 on an upswing. With the presidential campaign currently in a pre-convention season lull, both men are polishing their vice-presidential shortlists, a generally well-guarded backroom process which nevertheless provides hundreds of column inches of media speculation. Mr Bush's shortlist is being drawn up by his father's former defence secretary Dick Cheney, while Mr Gore's final selection will come from a list compiled by the former Clinton administration secretary of state Warren Christopher. Both men have been quietly interviewing the likely candidates before submitting their chosen finalists to a detailed personal vetting process, including their financial, tax and medical histories. By general consent, Mr Bush has a much stronger field of possibilities from which to choose, a reflection in part of the Republicans' advantage in having 30 state governors to choose from, compared with the Democrats' 18 (there are two independents), and 55 US senators compared with the Democrats' 45. Judging by his campaigning stance since the end of the primary contests, Mr Bush seems increasingly likely to opt for a Republican moderate to strengthen his claim to the electoral centre-ground, a decision which would anger many rightwing activists and enable Mr Bush to present his leadership as a break from the past. The current favourite on the Republican side seems to be Governor Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a decorated Vietnam veteran who is in favour of abortion rights despite being a Roman Catholic. A timely new poll yesterday showed that with Mr Ridge on the ticket, Mr Bush could carry Pennsylvania by 51% to 39%; without Mr Ridge, he would lead by only 44% to Mr Gore's 40%, uncomfortably close to the polling margin of error. Governor Frank Keating of Oklahoma is also widely tipped as a possible Bush \"soulmate\" nominee. The New Jersey governor, Christine Todd Whitman, another Republican moderate, is under consideration too, but is considered a longshot. Among senators, few believe that John McCain can be persuaded to join the Republican ticket, even if Mr Bush wanted him. Mr McCain's ally Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, though, is another matter: a smart pragmatist and another Vietnam veteran. Fred Thompson of Tennessee is another possibility, not least because he could embarrass Mr Gore in his home state. By common consent Mr Gore's choice is much more difficult. Not only are there deep divisions among Mr Gore's advisers about the kind of candidate they should select, but the field is much thinner than the Republicans'. That fact, along with Mr Bush's poll lead, has led to speculation that Mr Gore may go right outside the traditional pool of politicians and select a national personality, such as the NBC television news anchor Tom Brokaw, or the former treasury secretary Robert Rubin. If he follows Bill Clinton's example in 1992, Mr Gore will choose someone who would be a political soulmate, sending a message that he intends to lead from the centre. In that case, Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, a former state governor, would be central casting's idea of \"Gore's Gore\". But Mr Bayh is a relative unknown, and a bit too like Mr Gore in background. For that reason, Democratic moderates are pressing the claims of Senator Joseph Leiberman of Connecticut, an Orthodox Jew whose record of criticising Mr Clinton during the impeachment crisis might give the Democratic ticket a moral authority which some argue it could use. Increasingly, though, the name in the moderate frame - at least among Washington observers - is Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. Mr Kerry is another party moderate, a Catholic and a Vietnam veteran (though he opposed the war). If Mr Gore chooses instead to put someone from a key state on the ticket, Senator Bob Graham of Florida would be an obvious choice. Mr Graham is many people's frontrunner, not least because he is also already close to Mr Gore politically and personally. All the president's men The good news for Al Gore is that the vice-presidency is a more reliable stepping stone to the presidency than any other office in US politics. One in three vice-presidents has gone on to the highest office. The bad news is that only one vice-president in the past 164 years - George Bush in 1988 - has been elected to the White House at the end of his stint in the number two job. Seven out of the 21 20th century vice-presidents got the ultimate political upgrade. But, with the exception of Mr Bush, all of them did so amid tragedy, scandal or after first suffering political defeat. Teddy Roosevelt became president in 1901 after the assassination of William McKinley, the first of four 20th century vice-presidents to benefit from the death of a president in office. Vice-President Calvin Coolidge succeeded Warren Harding, who died in 1923. Harry Truman had the presidency thrust upon him when Franklin Roosevelt succumbed to a cerebral haemorrhage in April 1945. The 20-year cycle of presidential deaths in office brought Lyndon Johnson to the White House in November 1963 after John Kennedy was assassinated. Richard Nixon has gone down in history as the only president to resign. But he holds another unique historical distinction - as the only vice-president to reach the White House after first losing a presidential election. After two terms as Dwight Eisenhower's deputy from 1953, Nixon lost the 1960 presidential contest, but fought back to win the White House in 1968.

Repeatedly the report says: \"We have only just begun. We need to do more.'' Here the Guardian's chief political correspondent Patrick Wintour looks at some of the government's key manifesto pledges, the claims the report makes on meeting these commitments, and then gives a check against which these assertions can be matched.</p> <p><b>Education </b><br>Pledge: Over the course of a five-year parliament we will raise the proportion of national income spent on education. Claim: Spending per pupil in England has risen in real terms by \u00a3300 since 1997. Education will rise by 0.1% of national income in 2000-01 and by 0.2% in 2001-02, compared to 1996-97. Check: Claim is true and the government is on target to meet the pledge. Spending will rise in real terms by 3.2% per year over the parliament, and over the period of the comprehensive spending review by 5.2% per year. But average spending on education under the Tories between 1992-93 and 1996-97 as a proportion of GDP was 5%, compared with 4.7% for the whole of the Labour parliament.</p> <p>Pledge: We will reduce class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds to 30. Claim: 177,000 infants are now in large classes, compared with almost half a million in 1997. By September 2000 there are expected to be as few as 3% (around 50,000) of infants in classes over 30. Check: True, but class sizes for secondary schools have risen 0.2%.</p> <p>Pledge: All local education authorities must demonstrate that every school is improving. Ministers will order a \"fresh start\" for failing schools, close the school and start afresh on the same site. Claim: For 15 schools, fresh starts have been used. A further 32 failing schools have been closed, with children transferring to more successful schools nearby. Check: True - overall doing OK.</p> <p>Pledge: Within a decade every child will leave primary school with a reading age of at least 11 (barely half do today). Our numeracy taskforce will develop equally ambitious targets. Claim: Some 80% of 11-year-olds should reach the standard expected for their age in literacy by 2002. The 1999 results showed a 6% rise to 71%. We have introduced a similar 75% target for numeracy. 1999 results showed a 10% increase to 69%. Check: David Blunkett has promised to resign if he does not meet these targets. On course to stay in office.</p> <p>Pledge: Teachers will be entitled to positive support from parents to promote good attendance and sound discipline. New pupil referral units so that schools are protected but these pupils are not lost to education or the country. Claim: Spending on truancy, discipline and exclusions has risen from \u00a317m in 1996-97 to \u00a3140m in 2000-01. Check: Exclusions still rising, but conflictinbg advice from government as to if exclusions should be encouraged.</p> <p><b>Health </b><br> Pledge: We will cut NHS waiting lists by treating an extra 100,000 patients as a first step, by releasing \u00a3100m saved from NHS red tape. Claim: As of March 2000, in-patient waiting lists were 104,000 below the number inherited. Check: True, but number of out-patient waiting lists is 496,000, doubling from 284,000 since government came to power.</p> <p>Pledge: Hospitals will retain autonomy over day to day administrative functions, but boards will become more representative of local communities they serve. Claim: Since the government took office, 49% of NHS appointments have been women, and 12.2% have come from ethnic minority backgrounds. This compares with figures of 39% and 5% immediately before the election. Check: Public appointments commissioner denounced ministers for appointing 284 Labour councillors to boards and only 59 from other two parties.</p> <p>Pledge: We will raise spending on the NHS in real terms every year and put the money towards patient care. And a greater proportion of every pound will go on patient care, not bureaucracy. Claim: NHS has had its biggest ever increase in resources - an immediate cash boost this year of \u00a32bn plus average annual growth of 6% over next 4 years. Check: True, but Britain will still be behind in per capita spending in Europe. Spending in first two years lower than average for the Major years.</p> <p>Pledge: End waiting for cancer surgery, thereby helping thousands of women waiting for breast cancer surgery. Claim: More than 95% of women with suspected breast cancer now seen for their first out-patient appointment within two weeks of urgent referral. This year, we will extend that to all cancer patients. Check: True, but doctors claim waiting time less important than seeing appropriate specialist.</p> <p>Pledge: Smoking is the greatest single cause of preventable illness and premature death in the UK. We will therefore ban tobacco advertising. Claim: At present a legal challenge from the UK tobacco industry has prevented us from implementing the European directive banning tobacco advertising, Check: Advertising likely to continue for some events until 2006.</p> <p><b>Crime</b> Pledge: The police have our strong support. We will relieve them of unnecessary bureaucratic burdens to get more officers back on the beat. Claim: The relevant provisions of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 will be piloted in seven areas from summer 2000, ahead of expected national implementation in 2002. Check: Government unable yesterday to directly answer the pledge or explain the meaning of the claim. Police numbers have fallen in 33 out of 43 forces.</p> <p>Pledge: Child protection orders will deal with young children suffering neglect by parents because they are left out on their own far too late at night. Claim: Local child curfew in force since 30 September 1998. Child safety orders under the 1998 Act implemented nationally on June 1, 2000. Check: Not a single curfew application made by police or councils; only two child safety orders, both in Sunderland.</p> <p>Pledge: New parental responsibility orders will make parents face up to their responsibility for their children's misbehaviour. Claim: Parenting orders implemented nationally on June 1, 2000. Check: Only 42 imposed in pilot areas.</p> <p>Pledge: Community safety orders will deal with threatening and disruptive criminal neighbours.

Check: Very low take-up by council as violent crime increases by 10%.</p> <p>Pledge: Britain is a multiracial and multicultural society. All its members must have the protection of the law. Claim: Recommendations of Stephen Lawrence inquiry were accepted including extension of anti-discrimination laws. New ethnic minority targets set for police forces. Check: Reporting of racially aggravated offences rising - 11,0000 between April and September 1999 alone. Police say this reflects growing confidence in the policy by minority groups Pledge: The vicious circle of drugs and crime wrecks lives and threatens communities. We will appoint an anti-drugs supremo Claim: Keith Hellawell was appointed to head the UK anti-drugs co-ordinating unit, which has set ambitious targets for cutting availability and use of dangerous drugs. Check: Even the government admits progress is slow, and one third of all property crime is drug related. Drug treatment and testing orders due to go nationwide, but pilots showed a third of them had to be revoked for breaches. Soft drug use amongst children stabilised, surveys show.</p> <p><b>Economy and welfare </b><br> Pledge: Stable low inflation conditions for the long term. Claim: Inflation has averaged 2.5%. Check: Bank of England's independent committee a success, but inflation still higher than many EU countries.</p> <p>Pledge: Stop growth of an underclass. Claim: We have cut long-term unemployment among 18 to 24-year-olds by 124,000 and unemployment has fallen by 407,000 since the election (as at May 2000) and is at its lowest for 20 years. Check: Proportion of population living in working age workless families has decreased, but only from 21% in 1994-95 to 18% in 1998-99.</p> <p>Pledge: We must crack down on dishonesty in the benefit system, starting with a clampdown on housing benefit fraud, estimated to cost \u00a32bn a year. Claim: We have tightened up access to benefits. Check: Housing fraud prosecutions fell by 60,000 in 1998-99. Level of income support and job seekers allowance errors are on the increase and total benefit fraud estimated as high as \u00a37bn by MPs' public accounts committee.</p> <p>Pledge:System for dealing with asylum seekers is expensive. We will ensure swift and fair decisions. Claim: On course to deliver target of most initial asylum decisions within two months and most appeals within a further four months by April 2001. Check: Asylum applications up 22% on previous year last month, even if number of decisions had risen to 10,765 in May, double the figure for last year. Overall backlog had doubled from 57,000 in 1996 to 102,0000 at end of 1997.</p> <p><b>Democracy</b><br> Pledge: We are committed to a referendum on the voting system for the House of Commons. An independent commission on voting systems will be appointed early to recommend a proportional alternative to the first past the post system. Claim: The independent commission reported in October 1998. The timing of a referendum has not yet been decided. Check: Enthusiasm for reform is rapidly dampening and no referendum in this parliament and probably not in the next.</p> <p>Pledge: In time we will introduce legislation to allow the people, region by region, to decide in a referendum whether they want directly elected assemblies Claim: Work is in progress examining new models of regional governance where there is strong popular demand for them. Check: Government undecided on the merits of this one.</p> <p>Pledge: Establish a London mayor, Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly. Claim: All achieved.

Pledge: We will provide full backing to the bid to host the 2006 football World Cup in England. We will also work to bring the Olympics and other major international sporting events to Britain. Claim: The government provided strong support for the FA's bid, including a special envoy to assist the bid team. The final decision went against England. Check: Government gave lukewarm support to doomed bid which cost \u00a310m.

The BBC's behind-the-scenes cameras catch Tony Blair in a variety of embarrassing situations. They include an attempt to record his weekly website interview which is ruined by a malfunctioning tape-recorder. \"I thought we were supposed to be on top of technology in this government,'' the prime minister complains before recording it again. Mr Blair reveals to film-maker Michael Cockerell that it was his decision to pull his press spokesman off frontline duties briefing the media - \"his equivalent of doing prime minister's questions every day\" - so he could concentrate on strategic planning of government news management. By that test Mr Campbell emerges well from his decision to cooperate with the News From Number 10 documentary to be screened tomorrow: very much the dedicated official masterminding Downing Street's efforts to \"get the government's message to the public'' despite what he denounces as the media's own spin.

Louise Phillips, who has known Ms Blackman since she was a child, has been questioned by detectives for more than 10 hours for each of the past four days, The two 21-year-old women flew together to Japan, shared an apartment and worked in the same Tokyo hostess bar, the Casablanca. The police have not talked to any of the other women who worked in the bar. The Guardian has learned that the two women, both from Sevenoaks in Kent, are so close that the manager of the bar allowed Ms Phillips to collect Ms Blackman's pay on her behalf on the day she went missing. Ms Blackman, a former British Airways stewardess, disappeared on July 1 after telling Ms Phillips that she was going on an afternoon date with a customer she had met at the hostess bar. Two days later, Ms Phillips received a telephone call from a man calling himself Akira Takagi, who said Ms Blackman had joined him for spiritual training at a cult in Chiba prefecture, a neighbouring part of Tokyo.

But it cannot be as long as Israel sees itself as an exclusively Jewish state which happens to include some Arabs, and as long as both Israeli and Palestinian politics exhibit such exclusionist tendencies. Peace between Palestinians and Israelis, one Israeli commentator explained years ago, was not about getting married, but about getting divorced.</p> <p>It is the divorce papers that are being discussed in the United States, and much of what they will contain is known in advance. Israel will keep Jerusalem, keep its main settlements, get its way on water and roads and on Palestinian demilitarisation. The Palestinian state will be at best weak, at worst unworkable, at least in the longer run.

How could it? The disparity in force between the two sides is so large. It is known that the Israeli army has been training for some time for emergency operations in the West Bank, but if anything is certain it is that Israeli generals and politicians do not want such exercises ever to become a reality.

It would be a show of defiance, he might calculate, that would lay to rest charges that he is an Israeli puppet, and prompt comparison with the late Syrian leader Hafez al-Assad, who went to his grave refusing compromise. Afterwards, no doubt, relations with Israel could be discreetly resumed and the peace process begun anew.</p> <p>On the Israeli side, there is also a fear of future politics. Ehud Barak\u0090s troubles have shown the Israeli political system at its most dysfunctional. A particularly pure kind of proportional representation produces a range of mainly bull-headed parties, whose purpose is to extract maximum advantage for their special constituencies. The change in 1992 to a directly elected prime minister, which was supposed to strengthen the executive and make such party manoeuvring less effective, has had the opposite result. Pay-offs strew the path of any Israeli coalition, and the pay-offs have been used to create autonomous sub-societies, financed by public funds, which tribal entities then go on to make fresh demands.</p> <p>The system is double geared, so that creating a consensus on domestic policy usually involves giving in to blackmail on foreign and security policy, and vice versa. Barak, for instance, promised to end some categories of exemption from military service for the Orthodox, but had to retreat in an attempt to win agreement to his position in the peace negotiations. Typically, he made this and many other concessions but lost his coalition anyway.</p> <p>The feeling that much of their leverage would disappear after a final settlement with the Palestinians must contribute toward the obstinacy and unreliability of most Israeli political parties when faced with the choices that are necessary if there is to be such a settlement. Who knows what Israeli politics would be like after a settlement? Much traditional ideology would have been stripped out along the political spectrum, settler influence would be diminished, and the power of the religious parties reduced, once their ability to strike bargains on security policy had disappeared.</p> <p>Israeli politicians might have to confront the question of whether it is wise to allow the religious to continue to consume an undue share of resources while, in some instances at least, contributing little in return. They might have to tackle constitutional and electoral reform. They might have to admit Israeli Arabs to real political participation. They might have to deal directly with the country's ethnic and class divisions. They might have to consider dismantling at least part of the military and security apparatus that they have created over the years.</p> <p>No wonder a ripple of disquiet moves through the Israeli political class. On this analysis, reluctance to settle is not grounded on concrete objections to territorial changes or to the establishment of a Palestinian official presence on the fringes of Jerusalem. No, they fear instead the loss of the issue itself - the loss of the threat which has given Israeli society coherence and which at the same time has given certain narrow groups such disproportionate power.</p> <p>It is usually wrong to see much symmetry between Israelis and Palestinians. But it is true that Palestinian public life would be similarly changed. Once the national struggle in its old form is over, the purpose of politics would have to be redefined, and a Palestinian state might be very ill-equipped to undertake that task.

It has been the only blot on the picture book prettiness of the Hampshire village of Chawton, where Austen lived and wrote many of her most famous works. Today villagers, Jane Austen scholars and academics, including Germaine Greer, will mingle in the great hall of the house which was once the home of Jane Austen's brother Edward, and is still owned by his descendants. Sandy Lerner, an American computer millionairess, who bought a long lease on Chawton Manor in 1992, will pledge to match every pound raised, from her family's charitable trust.

Superintendent Phil Clarke, leading the search, said he was almost convinced the girl had been abducted. Repeated searches of the area near where she vanished had failed to throw up any evidence of a possible accident or misadventure.</p> <p>He said: \"If she has been abducted, almost certainly from the outset she has been hidden, whether in premises or somewhere in fields or woods.</p> <p>\"It seems to me that wherever Sarah is at the moment she is very well hidden and there is an intention on the part of the people or person who is hiding her that she should not be found.\"</p> <p>Search teams were yesterday focusing on an area from Kingston up a corridor around the A24 as far north as Crawley and stretching from Horsham as far east as East Grinstead. As the search through fields and woodlands got under way, detectives appealed to landowners, farmers, gamekeepers, utility workers and anyone else with local knowledge who might know where it was easy to hide someone.</p> <p>Supt Clarke said: \"If there are people out there who are thinking where would I put a little girl or keep a little girl where she would never ever be found, those are the people I would like to look in those places today and tomorrow and probably for the next few days until we have found Sarah.\"</p> <p>Police insisted they were not despondent, but merely realistic. The assistant chief constable of Sussex, Nigel Yeo, said: \"We are working on the basis that this is a missing person inquiry and that Sarah is still alive unless there is a reason not to.\"</p> <p>A further appeal was made for information about the white Transit-style van seen in Kingston Lane on the weekend that Sarah went missing, particularly somebody seen changing the rear doors of a white van or removing the internal wooden panelling. Detectives were still investigating the sighting of a man with a child resembling Sarah at a motorway service station in Cheshire.</p> <p><b>PC Tony Burstow, 50, a community beat officer in Worthing, West Sussex, was drafted in on day one of the search for Sarah. </b></p> <p>\"There is always that hope that you may be the one that will find her alive. Being a family man myself with four children and two grandchildren, an event like this does take right to the heart. I can imagine what the parents are going through.</p> <p>\"I was in on the Sunday to search the area. We trudged through wheatfields, down country lanes. The support from the public was fantastic.

      "bodyText": "The parents of missing eight-year-old Sarah Payne were last night coming to terms with the possibility that their daughter might not be found alive, police said. Detectives investigating the schoolgirl's disappearance near her grandparents' home at Kingston, West Sussex, almost a fortnight ago said all the possible outcomes had been discussed with Sarah's family. \"I have discussed with the Payne family a number of options and one of those options is that Sarah may not be found well and safe,\" said Detective Sergeant Sean Scott, a family liaison officer with Sussex police. \"The family are realistic but still hold on to the hope that she is safe, as do the inquiry team.\" He said they continued to cling to the hope that Sarah would be found safe and well but they were being realistic and accepted the possibility that this might not happen. Detectives yesterday brought the focus of the investigation back to Sussex, saying they were almost certain she had been abducted and hidden somewhere in the countryside. Superintendent Phil Clarke, leading the search, said he was almost convinced the girl had been abducted. Repeated searches of the area near where she vanished had failed to throw up any evidence of a possible accident or misadventure. He said: \"If she has been abducted, almost certainly from the outset she has been hidden, whether in premises or somewhere in fields or woods. \"It seems to me that wherever Sarah is at the moment she is very well hidden and there is an intention on the part of the people or person who is hiding her that she should not be found.\" Search teams were yesterday focusing on an area from Kingston up a corridor around the A24 as far north as Crawley and stretching from Horsham as far east as East Grinstead. As the search through fields and woodlands got under way, detectives appealed to landowners, farmers, gamekeepers, utility workers and anyone else with local knowledge who might know where it was easy to hide someone. Supt Clarke said: \"If there are people out there who are thinking where would I put a little girl or keep a little girl where she would never ever be found, those are the people I would like to look in those places today and tomorrow and probably for the next few days until we have found Sarah.\" Police insisted they were not despondent, but merely realistic. The assistant chief constable of Sussex, Nigel Yeo, said: \"We are working on the basis that this is a missing person inquiry and that Sarah is still alive unless there is a reason not to.\" A further appeal was made for information about the white Transit-style van seen in Kingston Lane on the weekend that Sarah went missing, particularly somebody seen changing the rear doors of a white van or removing the internal wooden panelling. Detectives were still investigating the sighting of a man with a child resembling Sarah at a motorway service station in Cheshire. PC Tony Burstow, 50, a community beat officer in Worthing, West Sussex, was drafted in on day one of the search for Sarah. \"There is always that hope that you may be the one that will find her alive. Being a family man myself with four children and two grandchildren, an event like this does take right to the heart. I can imagine what the parents are going through. \"I was in on the Sunday to search the area. We trudged through wheatfields, down country lanes. The support from the public was fantastic. There were people coming from everywhere. When we searched one cornfield, you just couldn't see the end of the line. \"I have been involved in various major investigations, but this one is different. With all the others there was always a crime scene and you work out from there. But with this one we just don't know. \"On the Monday we set up the house to house team. We have been searching house to house now for 12 days. Forty-two officers knocking on doors, interviewing, searching houses and gardens, trying to pick up any information that could be of use. \"It's hard to switch off. I have had one rest day in a fortnight, it is draining, these are long hours, but the ultimate aim is to find her.\" PC Burstow was speaking to Rebecca Allison",

The Tory leader accused the Labour government of damaging public confidence in democracy by doing more than any other in living memory to accelerate that loss of power, and he called on the prime minister to bring in urgent reforms to reassert the authority of the Commons. In a highly personalised attack on Tony Blair, Mr Hague said: \"You have created a government of secret briefings and leaks and gimmicks and gossip, in which power rests with unelected advisers, spin doctors and cronies.\" He told MPs: \"Parliament has been steadily diminished and is now no longer able to do its job properly.

Mr Blair, in response, mocked Mr Hague for raising \"piddling points\" and failing to address the \"big\" issues of the time, calling the Conservatives' choice of debate a \"piece of extraordinary eccentricity\". During a bitter exchange before a packed chamber, Mr Hague said the \"rights and relevance\" of parliament was being \"progressively diminished\" by a government whose behaviour was characterised by \"weakness and cowardice\". He said: \"It's time we had a prime minister who understood he's accountable to parliament, a prime minister who spent time at the palace of Westminster instead of seeking the first opportunity to escape back up Whitehall.'' Mr Hague opposed the planned reforms of Commons voting procedures, saying the changes were a further \"serious assault\" on the power of backbench MPs. Instead he called for the recommendations in the report by constitutional expert Lord Norton this week to be enacted. These include taking the appointment of MPs to select committees out of the hands of party whips, returning prime minister's questions to two slots a week instead of the present single 30-minute slot, and a parliamentary investigations officer to look at cases where information has been withheld from parliament. Mr Blair dismissed Mr Hague's claims as the speech of \"a 16-year-old who used to read Hansard under the bedclothes''. He poured scorn on the Norton report, and insisted that despite his own voting record of only 5% - compared to one of 32% for Mr Hague - he had spent as much, if not more, time in the Commons answering questions than previous prime ministers. He said the government was already modernising the Commons, but changes such as the reforms of the Lords and the devolution of power to Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and, in London, to a mayor, had \"made changes of fundamental consequence... to bring power closer to the people and hold government to account\".

Their scripted banter failed to ignite, and we were left positively looking forward to the adverts, which is never a good sign. </p> <p>Some of them were fun: a Belgian condom ad which was supposed to be erotic was weirdly reminiscent of a scene from Species (just before the heroine devours Alfred Molina), while the Argentinian equivalent showed a paterfamilias about to indulge in a threesome with two other men. </p> <p>Ultimately, though, there just aren't enough funny, sexy ads to go round, and the show ran out of steam pretty early. A British campaign to stop your dog from crapping in the street showed an old man in his pyjamas using the pavement as a toilet; well, someone at Channel 5 must have found it sexy. The studio games tried to eke things out to the full hour (\"We got a little bit jiggy on the table and I left my mess on the floor\" announced one contestant in a confessions round), but how they're going to keep the whole thing going for a three-part series boggles the imagination.</p> <p> BBC1 saw the return of Playing The Field, a drama series that started off being about women's football and has now turned into a 50-minute angst-fest. The characters competed to see who could be the most miserable. Would it be Luke (Ralph Ineson), returned from honeymoon with his wife? Or new character Holly, who was cheerful for about a minute before revealing a personal hell of spousal abuse?

      "bodyText": "People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, but that didn't stop Dani Behr from having a pop at \"the sort of sad prat who likes to watch large-breasted women running around in bathing suits\" during Sex Sells (C5). Behr had been drafted in alongside Rowland Rivron to present a selection of advertisements from around the world that use sexual images to flog anything from burgers to vibrators, and she gave the impression that the whole sordid business was beneath her. She sneered at Rivron, who set himself up as the kind of lonely self-abuser who tapes these ads for home entertainment, and joined in half-heartedly with a few pointless games. Their scripted banter failed to ignite, and we were left positively looking forward to the adverts, which is never a good sign. Some of them were fun: a Belgian condom ad which was supposed to be erotic was weirdly reminiscent of a scene from Species (just before the heroine devours Alfred Molina), while the Argentinian equivalent showed a paterfamilias about to indulge in a threesome with two other men. Ultimately, though, there just aren't enough funny, sexy ads to go round, and the show ran out of steam pretty early. A British campaign to stop your dog from crapping in the street showed an old man in his pyjamas using the pavement as a toilet; well, someone at Channel 5 must have found it sexy. The studio games tried to eke things out to the full hour (\"We got a little bit jiggy on the table and I left my mess on the floor\" announced one contestant in a confessions round), but how they're going to keep the whole thing going for a three-part series boggles the imagination. BBC1 saw the return of Playing The Field, a drama series that started off being about women's football and has now turned into a 50-minute angst-fest. The characters competed to see who could be the most miserable. Would it be Luke (Ralph Ineson), returned from honeymoon with his wife? Or new character Holly, who was cheerful for about a minute before revealing a personal hell of spousal abuse? Or the two camp mothers who played class variations on the theme of maternal anguish? It was a close-fought contest until the final five minutes when Luke, in a bold move, climbed up a tower and doused himself with petrol, claiming \"I'm nowt wi'out Shazza\" and threatened to torch himself. Luke returned to the ground, sodden but uncharred, and the laurels were his. Far from all this muck and misery roamed Hamish Wilson, a photographer and free spirit who undertook a trek across the burning plains of Somalia and Ethiopia in the footsteps of his hero, Sir Richard Burton, in Forbidden Journey (BBC2). Burton was the first European to penetrate the forbidden city of Harrar in 1854, a feat achieved through a mixture of guile and charm.

Bill was born in Hamp- shire, one of seven children of a rural carpenter. Despite a poor upbringing, education was encouraged in his family and, like most of his siblings, Bill went to university, studying chemistry at Reading.</p> <p>Influenced by his mother's free-thinking philosophy - and the sight of hunger marchers - he joined the Communist party in 1932. He found work as an industrial chemist, where, unwilling to be seen as \"manage- ment\", he repeatedly turned down offers of promotion - devoting his efforts, instead, to the Print Workers' Union and the party. He also took part in the battle of Cable Street, which prevented Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists from marching through the East End of London.</p> <p>In July 1936 came the Spanish civil war, an event that was to have a profound and lasting impact on Bill. Angered by the British government's duplicitous policy of non-intervention - Whitehall turned a blind eye to the huge levels of material support given to Franco by fascist Italy and Nazi Germany - he volunteered for the international brigades in the spring of 1937. Arriving in Spain soon after the murderous battle of Jarama, in which two-thirds of the British battalion were killed or wounded, he joined the newly-formed anti-tank battery, which was equipped with modern, high-velocity Soviet guns.</p> <p>Described by a comrade as \"a strict disciplinarian, but fearless\", Bill soon showed that his military efficiency matched his political resolve, and was appointed the battery's political commissar. This was a position of great responsibility and equal danger, for, in addition to being expected to lead from the front, political commissars were invariably executed if captured. Bill was cited for bravery at the battle at Belchite in September 1937; four months later, at Teruel in January 1938, he was promoted to captain and commander of the British battalion. The following month he was injured in the chest and shoulder by a bullet, adding another injury to the loss of hearing in his left ear, which had been caused by standing too close to one of the anti-tank guns. He was invalided home at the end of June 1938.</p> <p>Back in Britain, Bill continued to campaign for the Spanish republic, and was involved in numerous demonstrations outside the Spanish embassy. He also became Merseyside area secretary of the Communist party, which he remained until the outbreak of the second world war.</p> <p>In 1940 he was recommended by the \"red\" Duchess of Atholl for a commission at Sandhurst, where he finished top of his year. He served in north Africa, Italy and Germany, rising to the rank of captain in the reconnaissance corps, even though the promotion board made it clear they knew his history and political background. (Many of his comrades from Spain were not so fortunate, and suffered persistent discrimination.)</p> <p>After the war, Bill resumed his political activities in Britain, and, in addition to becoming Coventry secretary of the Communist party, stood unsuccessfully against Richard Crossman at Coventry East in the 1945 general election. From 1947-53, he was party secretary for the Midlands area, and, following a six-year period as secretary for Wales, became assistant general secretary of the party in 1959, a position he held until 1967.

The library holds the International Brigade archive, where Bill researched a number of works on the international brigades, including the official history of the volunteers from Britain and Ireland, British Volunteers For Liberty (1982), No To Franco (1992) and, with others, Memorials Of The Spanish Civil War (1996).</p> <p>He also wrote articles and letters challenging what he felt to be the mythology of the Spanish civil war. He was always strongly critical of the perception of the Spanish war as \"the poets' war\", and recently condemned Ken Loach's film Land And Freedom. He accused it - with some justification - of presenting a narrow and partisan view of the war that exaggerated the role of the British volunteers with the POUM (the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification) at the expense of the international brigaders, of whom he was justifiably proud. He once said: \"I regard everyone who went there as a hero or heroine.\" In that view, he was not alone.</p> <p>For many years, Bill was tireless in his efforts for the International Brigade Association, which he ruled with a rod of iron. He represented the organisation at numerous events, and led a group of surviving volunteers and their families on an emotional journey to Spain in 1986 to revisit the sites of the British volunteers' exploits. (The visit was filmed by the BBC for a television documentary, Return To The Battlefields.)

      "body": "<p>My first weather-porn experience occurred, fittingly enough, in bed. It was 4.30am on Martin Luther King Day, 1994, in Los Angeles, when I was woken from a shallow slumber by the sound of thundering paws. Household pets really do sense earthquakes several seconds before they happen. My cats skittered across the hardwood floor and hurled themselves under the bed. I knew exactly what was about to happen.</p> <p>Seconds later it hit. The bed - the whole house - began lurching like a mechanical bull in a country-and-western saloon. A hairline crack in the plaster ran eight feet up the wall in a trice, as if drawn by an invisible pencil. Objects hopped towards the edges of shelves as pictures unhooked themselves from the wall and crashed to the floor, and all the while an anguished feline keening issued from underneath the bed.</p> <p>And I was instantly possessed by uncontrollable laughter. Like someone suddenly finding the right place in a huge wave, I surrendered to forces entirely beyond my control - and I lay back to enjoy myself. </p> <p>The quake felt as if it lasted a minute or more, but time in these circumstances is notoriously elastic. It lasted 13 seconds. </p> <p>That apparently irrational laughter, which outlasted the catastrophe by a good 10 seconds, seems by any standard of reckoning a bizarre response to a potentially life-threatening calamity. On the other hand, so is screaming, and that's no fun at all. </p> <p>It's all adrenaline. You can see the same sort of demented surrender in The Perfect Storm, as George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg scourge their tiny swordfish boat through what was later dubbed \"the storm of the century\" - a malevolent confluence of three weather systems that gives the movie its title - hoping to land their huge catch before it rots.</p> <p>Not knowing they're doomed, they ride over and through terrifying mountains of water that dwarf their vessel, the pair of them screaming with maniacal glee as another gigantic wave crashes down on their decks. Who on earth would want to put themselves through this? </p> <p>Moviegoers have been doing exactly that with The Perfect Storm, though, and in their millions. Throughout the movie's gradual build-up one senses the audience's impatience. The mood in the cinema says: \"Bring it on. Throw everything you've got at me.\" When they get it full in the face, they're ecstatic. </p> <p>There's something about Mother Nature in a foul mood that awes us, particularly the notion that a wave, a wind, or even the ground beneath our feet is capable of destroying us and everything around us. When the Big One kicks in, be it a hurricane, a tidal wave, an earthquake or even a comet, some part of us wishes to understand what it feels like to be in the epicentre of the awfulness. This can be risky at best. Therefore we seem to have invented a vicarious alternative: weather porn. </p> <p>How else to explain the popularity of movies like The Perfect Storm, or books like Storm of the Century, Isaac's Storm, When The Wind Blows and Nature on the Rampage? The last offers \"hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, tornados, floods, heat waves, blizzards, volcanos, earthquakes and comets\". We've had Savage Skies and Savage Earth and Raging Planet. America's Weather Channel offers round the clock weather reports and educates viewers in the workings of the Richter Scale and the Seffir-Simpson scale, but livens up its schedules with sections like Our Violent Planet which showcases hot whirlwind and earthquake footage. </p> <p>And if that doesn't float your boat, or at least reduce it to matchwood, then head for the video store and rent Twister or Deep Impact or Hard Rain or Volcano or even Earthquake or The Wizard of Oz. And that's just the nonsense out of Hollywood. Most of those don't feature any heavy weather not cooked up on a digital effects workstation or in a studio tank. </p> <p>The real thing is so much more impressive. I don't mean real \"megastorms\" or \"hypercanes\" or eight-point tremblers, but video footage of them taken by camera-persons who are either stupid, suicidal or certifiable. Once upon a time you could only find this stuff on an occasional nature documentary. Now you can get hold of entire compilations of Mother Nature's hissy fits from concerns as large as the Weather Channel or from small magazines like Stormtrack and collectors like the Vermont-based Tornado Project.</p> <p>The latter is headed by climatologist Tom Grazulis and offers over 500 hours of tornado footage. Grazulis's two-hour tapes let you know the date, location, damage-assessment and even the death toll of every whirlwind it fetishises. One of his video boxes promises \"spectacular tree-snapping, roof-flying footage... A man is hit by lightning while filming a tornado but doesn't stop until hit by debris from his own house!\" </p> <p>\"Here's this thing that's a mile high,\" says Grazulis, explaining a tornado's appeal, \"and it's roaming around with the energy of a nuclear power plant. This thing is out of control. It's sneaky, it doesn't belong on the planet. It's prowling, and it comes and goes at will. It's too big, it's too devious and this damn thing ought to be whipped into shape!\" </p> <p>Fat chance. If anything the stormchasing maniacs who run into such situations are the things that'll be whipped into shape, or smashed into atoms. But what their cameras and those of other weather-freaks capture is footage of astounding power: mile-long suspension bridges rolling like sheets of wet lasagne, hurricanes tearing roofs off some buildings and flattening others, earthquakes destroying whole streets and hurling cameramen to the ground. Since a lot of what's collected is in home-movie form, the soundtracks often feature real people screaming \"Holy Jesus\", or \"Get your ass in the fucking basement!\" </p> <p>From the safety of the couch the similarities between stuff like this and hardcore porn are self evident. Nothing matters but the bump'n'grind of weather systems destroying man's hard work. Forget the dialogue; gimme the close-up, gimme the money shot. And you can fast-forward through the dull parts, and replay the really naughty stuff over and over. Oh, and the people making the movie might actually die right on screen, which is something of an entertainment bonus. </p> <p>It's been a long strange trip from a SenSurround Charlton Heston in Earthquake to this kind of material. Studios spend fortunes trying to recreate rotten weather; and mad amateurs spend nothing capturing the real thing. Either way, in print, on TV and at the movies, we lap it up. \"Blow wind!\" we cry. \"Crack your cheeks! And while you're at, it would you mind reducing those 90-foot pylons to kebab skewers?\" </p> <p>Brutish weather has always exerted a macabre fascination. Voltaire was obsessed with the Lisbon earthquake of 1775, which flattened the city and claimed more than 20,000 lives. Daniel Defoe wrote a book about the great storm that tormented southern England and killed 8,000 people in 1703. </p> <p>But the weather has been particularly on our minds in the past decade or so. We've learned about global warming and read about El Nino. We've seen volcanoes at Montserrat and Mount St Helen, earthquakes in Armenia, Mexico City, Japan and California, to name just a few, We've learned that we may sometimes tame the land but we'll never harness the wind and the water. We know more about inclement weather than we ever have, but that knowledge has no power in the face of our stupidity. </p> <p>If there have been more disasters in the last 10 years it's sometimes because we willingly move into their path. The southeastern seaboard of the US, from North Carolina down to Florida, has always been prone to attack by hurricanes moving in off the Caribbean, but in the last 30 years the coastal populations of these areas have increased threefold. Hurricane Andrew did $25bn worth of damage in 1992, mainly because there was so much more to destroy than there had been a few years previously. </p> <p>Innovations in home-video technology also mean that many more people can now capture such disasters for posterity and for our delectation. This is the sort of material that turns up in TV specials with names like When Mother Nature Attacks! or Real Life Natural Disasters! And now that we're all visually accustomed to the wobbly cameras and grainy photography of COPS and World's Wildest Police Chases and similar shows, we are primed to accept this often sub-par, ill-lit footage of natural mayhem without complaint. And TV networks anxious to fill their expanding schedules with cheap, reality-based shows will keep buying up the footage and replaying it until we beg for mercy. </p> <p>There's something millennarian about our love for weather-porn. It appeals to our sense of vulnerability, and possibly even to a fear of our creator. As ever, the God Squad has its explanations. Religious bigot and former presidential candidate Pat Robertson has claimed that the reason Orlando, Florida, has experienced so many storms is because God is angry that Disneyland welcomes gays.</p> <p>The Reverend Pat should consider the experience of one of his fellow televangelists. The entire Oral Roberts University campus and TV facility in Oklahoma City was flattened by a tornado in 1974. Nothing outside the campus was touched, an example of how really bad weather can sometimes do really big favours for mankind.</p> <p>\u0095 The Perfect Storm is released on July 28.</p>",

Daniel Defoe wrote a book about the great storm that tormented southern England and killed 8,000 people in 1703. But the weather has been particularly on our minds in the past decade or so. We've learned about global warming and read about El Nino. We've seen volcanoes at Montserrat and Mount St Helen, earthquakes in Armenia, Mexico City, Japan and California, to name just a few, We've learned that we may sometimes tame the land but we'll never harness the wind and the water. We know more about inclement weather than we ever have, but that knowledge has no power in the face of our stupidity. If there have been more disasters in the last 10 years it's sometimes because we willingly move into their path. The southeastern seaboard of the US, from North Carolina down to Florida, has always been prone to attack by hurricanes moving in off the Caribbean, but in the last 30 years the coastal populations of these areas have increased threefold. Hurricane Andrew did $25bn worth of damage in 1992, mainly because there was so much more to destroy than there had been a few years previously. Innovations in home-video technology also mean that many more people can now capture such disasters for posterity and for our delectation. This is the sort of material that turns up in TV specials with names like When Mother Nature Attacks! or Real Life Natural Disasters! And now that we're all visually accustomed to the wobbly cameras and grainy photography of COPS and World's Wildest Police Chases and similar shows, we are primed to accept this often sub-par, ill-lit footage of natural mayhem without complaint. And TV networks anxious to fill their expanding schedules with cheap, reality-based shows will keep buying up the footage and replaying it until we beg for mercy. There's something millennarian about our love for weather-porn. It appeals to our sense of vulnerability, and possibly even to a fear of our creator. As ever, the God Squad has its explanations. Religious bigot and former presidential candidate Pat Robertson has claimed that the reason Orlando, Florida, has experienced so many storms is because God is angry that Disneyland welcomes gays. The Reverend Pat should consider the experience of one of his fellow televangelists. The entire Oral Roberts University campus and TV facility in Oklahoma City was flattened by a tornado in 1974. Nothing outside the campus was touched, an example of how really bad weather can sometimes do really big favours for mankind. \u0095 The Perfect Storm is released on July 28.",

      "body": "<p>I first met Michelangelo Antonioni in 1982 in Cannes, where he was showing his film Identification of a Woman. I had brought Hammett to the film festival, and was as impressed with Antonioni's new film as I had been by his earlier movies such as Blow-up and Zabriskie Point or, before that L'Avventura, La Notte and L'Eclisse. </p> <p>As part of a documentary I was making on the development of film language, I had invited all the directors at Cannes to speak on camera on the future of the cinema as they saw it. Many of them had taken up my invitation, among them Herzog, Fassbinder, Spielberg, Godard and Antonioni.</p> <p>Each was left by himself in a room with a Nagra tape-recorder, a 16mm camera and brief instructions. Each was free to \"direct\" his reply to the question I put to them all. The finished film was called Chambre 666, after the room in the Hotel Martinez where it had all taken place. It was the last available hotel room in the whole of Cannes. </p> <p>For me, the most impressive statement on the future of the cinema was that of Antonioni. What he said was this: \"It's true, film is in grave danger. The effect of TV on people's viewing habits and expectations - especially children's - is clear. On the other hand, part of the reason that the situation seems so grave to us is because we belong to an older generation.</p> <p>\"What we should do is try to adapt to the different technologies that are coming into being... It's not an easy thing, to talk about the future of the cinema. High-definition video cassettes will soon bring it into our houses; cinemas probably won't be needed any more. All our contemporary structures will disappear. It won't be quick or straightforward, but it will happen, and we can't do anything to prevent it. All we can do is try to adjust to it.\"</p> <p>It wasn't just the statement that impressed me, it was Antonioni himself - his confident yet unassuming way of talking, his movements, the way he walked up and down in front of the camera and stood by the window. The man was as cool and stylish as his work, and his outlook was every bit as radical and modern as the films he made. </p> <p>Barely a year after our meeting, I heard that he had suffered a stroke which had left him aphasic, severely limited in his ability to speak. It was upsetting news, and I could only hope that rehabilitation and further treatment might improve his condition. But I lost touch with Antonioni until, a couple of years later, I was approached by a producer who asked whether I would be prepared to step in for Antonioni as a back-up director, because without someone else, no film of his would find insurers. </p> <p>So I met up with Antonioni again in Rome, and for a time it looked as though the project - called Due Telegrammi (Two Telegrams), based on one of his own stories and with a script by Rudi Wurlitzer - was going to happen. But there were delays, and finally I couldn't keep myself available for it any longer because my own project, Until the End of the World, got under way. I disappeared into that for several years, and once more we lost touch. </p> <p>Then, in autumn 1993, I was approached by another producer, St\u00e9phane Tchalgadjieff, to see if I would do something similar. Tchalgadjieff was known to me principally as the producer of some of Jacques Rivette's early films. The project he was developing with Antonioni was called Beyond the Clouds, and was based on several stories from Antonioni's book, Quel Bowling Sul Tevere (The Bowling Alley on the Tiber), which I'd read once years ago, and which is also where the story for Due Telegrammi had come from.</p> <p>The stories had been given a framing narrative about a film director and Tchalgadjieff was looking not only for a back-up director to satisfy the insurance companies, in view of Antonioni's continuing disability, but also for a co-director, who was to direct the framing narrative around the individual episodes, which of course would be directed by Antonioni himself. </p> <p>By then I had finished Faraway, So Close, and I didn't have another project ready. I went to see Antonioni again in Rome and he made it clear that I was his choice and that he wanted me to be involved, so I agreed. In addition to my personal sympathy for him, and my admiration for his work, there was one particularly strong reason why I wanted to embark on this extraordinary venture: I was convinced that a director like Antonioni, in spite of his age and his handicap, should be given an opportunity to make the film he could clearly see in his mind's eye. </p> <p>It was obvious that he could understand everything that was put to him, and that mentally he was as alert as ever. He hadn't lost his sense of humour either; it was just that he couldn't speak, except for a dozen or so words of basic Italian.</p> <p>I remember one of our first meetings, in a restaurant in Rome. His wife Enrica, who always interprets for him, had popped out. Antonioni and I sat in silence for a moment, and I suppose I said something to him in French, which, along with my poor Italian, was how I used to communicate with him during the filming. He shrugged his shoulders, smiled sadly and said just one word, \"Parlare!\" (\"Speak!\") while at the same time waving his hand back and forth in front of his face, with the tips of fingers and thumb held together - the inimitable gesture that will always be part of how I remember him. </p> <p>Antonioni's stroke had destroyed the letter-forming and spelling centres of his brain, so he was unable to write or speak. As the stroke had affected his right side, he could draw only with his left hand. And that was what he did as a last resort when trying to make his meaning clear, if Enrica's amazing knack of finding the words he wanted had for once failed her. And then Enrica, or Antonioni's personal assistant Andrea Boni, would always have a pad and pencil handy, so that he could make a sketch to clarify his meaning. These left-handed sketches of his were amazingly precise for a right-hander, and became an indispensable means of communication, especially once the actual filming had begun. </p> <p>Even though Antonioni was unable to write himself, he was well able to correct or edit something someone else had written. And thank God there was someone at hand who wrote in such a way that he felt understood from the outset: Tonino Guerra, his screenwriter. </p> <p>Guerra and Antonioni were old friends and had written a lot of films together, beginning with L'Avventura in 1959. The scenes that Guerra had scripted were based on Antonioni's own stories in Quel Bowling Sul Tevere, published in 1983, a collection of short stories, never-used ideas for films, diary entries, essays, aphorisms and scraps of dialogue. </p> <p>With the help of Enrica and Boni, Antonioni, Guerra and I went through all these stories again, before finally settling on four of them for the film. They were The Story of a Love That Never Was, The Girl, The Crime, This Filthy Body, and finally Two Telegrams, which we updated to Two Faxes. </p> <p>Antonioni had accepted that I was to shoot the narrative framework, but I think his acceptance may have been rather half-hearted. Certainly, I couldn't help thinking from the start that he tended to see my contribution as something of a \"necessary evil\", and that he would rather have shot the whole film by himself. I couldn't blame him for that; after all, I understood his point of view very well. According to the producers, though, the film could have been financed only as a film by Antonioni and Wenders together. And that, finally, is how the film was financed, as a French/German/Italian co-production. </p> <p>All this needs to be spelled out, because I would gladly have accommodated Antonioni's more or less evident desire that the film be all his, and for a while I tried to keep that open as an option for the producers. But in the end, that would have meant the project collapsing again. The distributors and the TV companies, who had stumped up the money, wanted a film from the two of us. There was no going back on that, for either of us. </p> <p>It was decided that Antonioni would film his four episodes first, and after a short break, I would shoot my part. Each individual shoot was to last a fortnight, which meant a total time of 10 weeks. The budget wouldn't stretch to a single day more. </p> <p>Antonioni would film his stories using Alfio Contini - his cameraman on Zabriskie Point - and I would probably work with Robby M\u00fcller, if he was available. We had originally planned to start in spring 1994, but spring came and the financing and other arrangements were still far from complete. And so the beginning of filming was put back to late summer 1994. </p> <p>I used the unexpected postponement to shoot, very spontaneously, a little film in Portugal called Lisbon Story. That took just five weeks and in June I was already back on the case with Antonioni. If everything went according to plan, he would be finished just before Christmas, and I could begin on my part of the shoot in mid-January.</p> <p>In fact, anything was possible, and there was no knowing what would happen. Between my hope that Antonioni would have his shoot completely under control, and direct the whole thing by himself, and the worst-case scenario - that he quite simply couldn't, and that I would be required by the producers and insurers to step into the breach - there were all sorts of possible shadings.</p> <p>On occasion I was pretty much the only optimist around, and it was a struggle to remain optimistic, not least when it became clear that Antonioni's memory was faulty, and you couldn't be sure from one day to the next whether a decision taken the day before still stood or not. So it seemed crucial to the success of the film, and for Antonioni's ability to control events, that we plan the shoot in as much detail as possible, and do it in chronological order. The chances of making up for some slip of memory would be much improved if we were able to go forward scene by scene and shot by shot. </p> <p>The preparations went ahead. Antonioni did his location recces pretty much by himself, though I often joined him. He also did the casting on his own, with Enrica's collaboration. We all embarked on our adventure with an equal measure of patience and enthusiasm. The only way to see what sort of film Antonioni had in mind was to let him make it. Therefore, it had to be made. </p> <p>\u0095 My Time with Antonioni by Wim Wenders (Faber, \u00a314.99) is published on Monday.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Despite reports to the contrary, the music industry continues to make pots of money. Acts are not so much bands as international business phenomena. And, among the slew of platinum-selling R&amp;B, hip-hop, dance, country and rock products, arguably the most extraordinary sales phenomenon of the last decade is an album by a bunch of senior citizens from a communist country brought together by a middle-aged American patron.</p> <p>Released in 1997, Buena Vista Social Club - featuring Compay Segundo, Eliades Ochoa, Ibrahim Ferrer, Ruben Gonzalez and Paris, Texas movie scorer Ry Cooder - has broken every pop rule in the book. Four million times and counting, in fact.</p> <p>The group's timing was perfect. As the pop world became increasingly dominated by manufactured bimbos (of both genders), drab ex-students with guitars and cheerfully empty rave-trance bunnies, Buena Vista offered proper musicianship, implied wisdom and substance, exotica, authenticity and a heartwarming rags-to-riches story, caught in the old geezers' beaming, weather-beaten faces and in Wim Wenders's spin-off movie. The package crossed over to that key section of the market, the moneyed, middle-class dinner-party set, and cleaned up.</p> <p>Of course, where there is money, there is a bandwagon. At the most commercial, chart-orientated end, we have Ricky Martin, Christina Aguilera, and every hack from Geri Halliwell to Tom Jones hastily sneaking a Latin element into their banal repertoire.</p> <p>Meanwhile, every ageing Cuban within spitting distance of a studio has had an album out in the last two years, while the majors raid their vaults for salsa oldies to stick out on summer compilations.</p> <p>Latin is big - official. But what is the Buena Vista bandwagon doing to Cuba itself? Where are the young Cuban turks? What happens to the Latin boom now the coffee-table consumer has moved on to Moby? And will the northern hemisphere just use up Cuba's awesome musicality, and then spit it out when a new fad comes along?</p> <p>Perhaps the answer to these questions lies somewhere in a batch of British albums being released this summer. Sidestepper, Da Lata, Up, Bustle and Out, and James Hardway may not mean much to you at present, but they are all underground, dance-orientated artists seeking a bigger audience by fusing Brit beats with Latin grooves taken directly from the source.</p> <p>These follow the recent recorded-in-Cuba Tropical Brainstorm album (V2) by Brit vocal veteran Kirsty MacColl. Sidestepper's More Grip and Da Lata's Songs From the Tin (both on Palm Pictures) use the musicians and environments of Columbia and Brazil respectively; meanwhile, Up, Bustle and Out's Rebel Radio Master Sessions (Ninja Tune) and Hardway's Moors and Christians (Hydrogen Dukebox) raid Havana, Cuba itself. Indeed, Hardway goes further by linking his brassy, percussive Cuban rhythms and textures with the basslines, dubby atmospheres and rambunctious vocals of old-school Jamaican reggae, to dazzling effect.</p> <p>Hardway (real name Dave Harrow) is a veteran muso, a saxophonist who has worked with the alternative likes of Psychic TV and Tackhead. He also produced Billie Ray Martin's dance hit Your Loving Arms, before making three albums'-worth of scientific, jazzy drum'n'bass.</p> <p>Moors and Christians, his first experiment with Latin, involved recording a set of rhythms in London, and getting a host of collaborators to embellish them over two weekends in Cuba and one in Jamaica. The recording sessions themselves were short, but editing the complex results took five months.</p> <p>Does Hardway accept that the sudden appearance of all these Latin fusions looks a trifle... convenient? \"It's very easy to be cynical about it all. But, for me, it's a logical progression. I come from a reggae background, which got me into drum'n' bass; the more you speed up and cut up drum'n'bass rhythms, the more they sound like jazz. After a while, I began to hear how much those rhythms resembled bossa nova.</p> <p>\"Nothing we do is new - we're just coming at it from a different angle. Music is a bit like weightlifting. If you're standing in front of the mirror tossing the bar up and down thinking you look good, well, you're obviously not lifting enough weight. Music should never be easy.\"</p> <p>David Hutcheon, world music critic for Mojo magazine, prefers Sidestepper's cumbia-influenced adventure, but concurs with Hardway's positive view. \"I think these records come from a genuine liking of the music. It's not exploitative, because the dinner party set are not going to jump from Buena Vista to Hardway.\"</p> <p>Perhaps not. But Hardway admits that, despite the musicians' excellence, recording in Cuba is the studio equivalent of cheap labour. \"With the Cuban musicians, I paid everybody twice as much as they asked for. But still everybody only earned $50 [about \u00a335] a day.

      "bodyText": "Despite reports to the contrary, the music industry continues to make pots of money. Acts are not so much bands as international business phenomena. And, among the slew of platinum-selling R&amp;B, hip-hop, dance, country and rock products, arguably the most extraordinary sales phenomenon of the last decade is an album by a bunch of senior citizens from a communist country brought together by a middle-aged American patron. Released in 1997, Buena Vista Social Club - featuring Compay Segundo, Eliades Ochoa, Ibrahim Ferrer, Ruben Gonzalez and Paris, Texas movie scorer Ry Cooder - has broken every pop rule in the book. Four million times and counting, in fact. The group's timing was perfect. As the pop world became increasingly dominated by manufactured bimbos (of both genders), drab ex-students with guitars and cheerfully empty rave-trance bunnies, Buena Vista offered proper musicianship, implied wisdom and substance, exotica, authenticity and a heartwarming rags-to-riches story, caught in the old geezers' beaming, weather-beaten faces and in Wim Wenders's spin-off movie. The package crossed over to that key section of the market, the moneyed, middle-class dinner-party set, and cleaned up. Of course, where there is money, there is a bandwagon. At the most commercial, chart-orientated end, we have Ricky Martin, Christina Aguilera, and every hack from Geri Halliwell to Tom Jones hastily sneaking a Latin element into their banal repertoire. Meanwhile, every ageing Cuban within spitting distance of a studio has had an album out in the last two years, while the majors raid their vaults for salsa oldies to stick out on summer compilations. Latin is big - official. But what is the Buena Vista bandwagon doing to Cuba itself? Where are the young Cuban turks? What happens to the Latin boom now the coffee-table consumer has moved on to Moby? And will the northern hemisphere just use up Cuba's awesome musicality, and then spit it out when a new fad comes along? Perhaps the answer to these questions lies somewhere in a batch of British albums being released this summer. Sidestepper, Da Lata, Up, Bustle and Out, and James Hardway may not mean much to you at present, but they are all underground, dance-orientated artists seeking a bigger audience by fusing Brit beats with Latin grooves taken directly from the source. These follow the recent recorded-in-Cuba Tropical Brainstorm album (V2) by Brit vocal veteran Kirsty MacColl. Sidestepper's More Grip and Da Lata's Songs From the Tin (both on Palm Pictures) use the musicians and environments of Columbia and Brazil respectively; meanwhile, Up, Bustle and Out's Rebel Radio Master Sessions (Ninja Tune) and Hardway's Moors and Christians (Hydrogen Dukebox) raid Havana, Cuba itself. Indeed, Hardway goes further by linking his brassy, percussive Cuban rhythms and textures with the basslines, dubby atmospheres and rambunctious vocals of old-school Jamaican reggae, to dazzling effect. Hardway (real name Dave Harrow) is a veteran muso, a saxophonist who has worked with the alternative likes of Psychic TV and Tackhead. He also produced Billie Ray Martin's dance hit Your Loving Arms, before making three albums'-worth of scientific, jazzy drum'n'bass. Moors and Christians, his first experiment with Latin, involved recording a set of rhythms in London, and getting a host of collaborators to embellish them over two weekends in Cuba and one in Jamaica. The recording sessions themselves were short, but editing the complex results took five months. Does Hardway accept that the sudden appearance of all these Latin fusions looks a trifle... convenient? \"It's very easy to be cynical about it all. But, for me, it's a logical progression. I come from a reggae background, which got me into drum'n' bass; the more you speed up and cut up drum'n'bass rhythms, the more they sound like jazz. After a while, I began to hear how much those rhythms resembled bossa nova. \"Nothing we do is new - we're just coming at it from a different angle. Music is a bit like weightlifting. If you're standing in front of the mirror tossing the bar up and down thinking you look good, well, you're obviously not lifting enough weight. Music should never be easy.\" David Hutcheon, world music critic for Mojo magazine, prefers Sidestepper's cumbia-influenced adventure, but concurs with Hardway's positive view. \"I think these records come from a genuine liking of the music. It's not exploitative, because the dinner party set are not going to jump from Buena Vista to Hardway.\" Perhaps not. But Hardway admits that, despite the musicians' excellence, recording in Cuba is the studio equivalent of cheap labour. \"With the Cuban musicians, I paid everybody twice as much as they asked for. But still everybody only earned $50 [about \u00a335] a day. It's hard, because you know, in our terms, you're getting them cheap.\" Hutcheon is also pessimistic about the long-term benefits of the Latin fad for indigenous musicians. \"Before Buena Vista, the only people that were really listening to Latin music were the salsa dance-class crowd. They don't go to gigs and they don't buy the albums. The Buena Vista people will buy that album and then move on to something else that sounds good around the coffee table.

      "bodyText": "Fourteen-year-old Harry Potter awoke to find the scar on his forehead burning. Could it mean that Lord Voldemort wasn't dead after all? Just then a letter arrived inviting him to the Quidditch World Cup between Ireland and Bulgaria. \"Wow,\" said Harry. \"Did you see Wronski feint as he got the snitch?\" \"I want his autograph,\" said Ron. Just then, as Ireland celebrated, a dark mark appeared in the sky and hooligans terrified some muggles. Could it be that the Death Eaters were near? \"I'll bet 'Oathead' Malfoy had something to do with it,\" said Harry grimly. Harry, Hermione and Ron assembled in the Great Hall for the start of the new term at Hogwarts. Professor Dumbledore had an announcement. \"For the first time in hundreds of years the Triwizard Competition will be held here. The Hogwarts' champion will take on the champions of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang.\" \"Cor,\" said Ron. \"I\"m going to enter.\" \"Owing to the possibility of death,\" Dumbledore continued, \"only those over 17 may enter.\" The three schools gathered around the Goblet of Fire to see who would be the three champions taking part. Out came Durmstrang's Viktor Krum, Beauxbatons' Fleur Delacour and Hogwarts' Cedric Diggory. Everyone cheered. Then a fourth name came out of the goblet: Harry Potter. Everyone gasped. \"Things are getting sirius,\" said Sirius, Harry's godfather. \"Is Ron avoiding me?\" asked Harry. \"He's jealous of all the attention you get,\" said Hermione. \"He should try fronting a bestselling series of books some time.\" It was time for the first challenge. \"You've got to choose a girl to partner you at the Christmas Ball,\" said Ron. \"What's a girl?\" asked Harry. \"Dunno. You could try Hermione.\" \"I've already been asked,\" said Hermione coyly. The second challenge passed and Harry's scar burned fiercer still. Voldemort was near. The Quidditch pitch had been utterly transformed for the third challenge. Harry took a deep breath. \"Phew,\" said Harry on page 636. \"Kisses, deaths, battles, resurrections, ghosts and transformations; it's been a hell of a year. Time for a nice rest before Book Five.\" And if you really are pressed: The digested read, digested... Harry Potter goes to the Quidditch World Cup and gets chosen for the Triwizard competition and... and you're not going to get the rest of the plot out of me this time - read it yourself.",
