      "body": "<p>Only a scant knowledge of economics is necessary to realise that in the nature of things a boom must eventually go bust. Football, however, appears set on defying economic law for some time yet. </p> <p>As the new season begins there is no obvious sign that the game in England, with all its shortcomings, is about to loosen its bulldog grip on either the public's affection or the public's purse. When people queue up outside the Manchester United megastore at midnight in order to be the first to buy the latest design in shirts at \u00a348 for adults and \u00a338 for children, it is hard to argue that the game is heading for the rocks. </p> <p>Certainly the television companies do not share this view, scrambling over one another to pour more millions into club coffers under the latest agreement while said millions are being mortgaged by boardrooms to pay the fees and salaries of costly new signings. </p> <p>Much of the football may be mundane but financially the game, in general terms, has never had it so good. As well as the latest strike at the TV goldmine, clubs stand to earn extra windfalls through sponsorship and kit deals. And while their supporters may complain about increased admission prices, they have yet to stay away in significant numbers. Miss a match and withdrawal symptoms soon set in. </p> <p>With a captive and captivated audience, football, it seems, cannot lose. The unknown potential of pay-per-view has yet to be exploited to a serious degree but there is a proliferation of dot-commery to give fans a quick fix. A fully fledged European league is imminent and more new stadiums are planned, with Arsenal set to rebuild barely a mile down the road from Highbury. </p> <p>Given such an optimistic background, dissenters are apt to be given the sort of bemused glance accorded to those mournful figures who used to parade outside football grounds advising customers to prepare to meet their doom. </p> <p>At regular intervals financial experts warn that football is dancing on thin ice with heated skates. Yet the waltz continues, with an ever-higher proportion of club turnovers being spent on players' salaries as managers strive to keep their jobs while directors juggle to keep supporters and the banks happy. </p> <p>Inflation is rife. Students of O-level economics are taught that inflation is the result of too much money chasing too few goods, and when Tottenham feel compelled to spend \u00a35m on a defender, Ben Thatcher, from a relegated team, Wimbledon, the point is surely proved. Everybody, however, seems happy with the way things are. </p> <p>Only two things, in the main, could upset this sanguine state of affairs. One is a recession of sufficient severity to curtail the public's spending power and leave football with a lot of replica shirts on its hands, but there is no sign of this yet. </p> <p>The other is a stage at which BSkyB felt its coverage had reached such a point of saturation that no useful purpose would be served by forever upping the ante. If that happened a shudder would run through the game's balance sheets, but the process of soaking the viewers has barely begun. </p> <p>Fans will always moan about a losing team and few have ever had a good word to say about referees, but in general it seems that football can do no wrong. The England team may have failed in a major tournament under a coach whose only credentials appear to have been his popularity and ability to get on with the media, but England teams have flopped before without diminishing people's enthusiasm for a flawed but invigorating domestic game. </p> <p>The proliferation of foreign players, some outstanding, most merely competent, makes it easier for supporters to dissociate themselves from the mediocrity of the national team. Why worry about who will follow Alan Shearer in the England attack when your club has signed a talented Ukrainian, Sergei Rebrov, or a goalscoring Dutchman, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink? </p> <p>Fans are not daft. They know that technically the Premiership is not on a par with the leagues of Italy and Spain, but will insist that for action, incident and excitement it has no equals, an argument supported by the number of foreign countries who take the live TV coverage from English grounds. </p> <p>\"English football is at its best when our teams are playing each other,\" Ron Greenwood declared many years ago, and the domestic product continues to support this view. Terry Venables was also right when he said that the English game thrived on errors which became an embarrassment when repeated in international tournaments, a point well made by Kevin Keegan's team this summer. </p> <p>This is why, while Manchester United and Arsenal may be among the European clubs forever threatening to break away and form their own TV-orientated league, fans will take a great deal of persuading that such a competition could ever take precedence over the present scheme of things. In the longer term, domestic rivalries will always have more appeal than international rivalries. </p> <p>The Premiership remains a lead pencil with a gold top but few fans are complaining. And United will not stay top forever, even though it may take Sir Alex Ferguson's impending retirement to end their present domination. If he actually goes, that is.</p>",

As well as the latest strike at the TV goldmine, clubs stand to earn extra windfalls through sponsorship and kit deals. And while their supporters may complain about increased admission prices, they have yet to stay away in significant numbers. Miss a match and withdrawal symptoms soon set in. With a captive and captivated audience, football, it seems, cannot lose. The unknown potential of pay-per-view has yet to be exploited to a serious degree but there is a proliferation of dot-commery to give fans a quick fix. A fully fledged European league is imminent and more new stadiums are planned, with Arsenal set to rebuild barely a mile down the road from Highbury. Given such an optimistic background, dissenters are apt to be given the sort of bemused glance accorded to those mournful figures who used to parade outside football grounds advising customers to prepare to meet their doom. At regular intervals financial experts warn that football is dancing on thin ice with heated skates. Yet the waltz continues, with an ever-higher proportion of club turnovers being spent on players' salaries as managers strive to keep their jobs while directors juggle to keep supporters and the banks happy. Inflation is rife. Students of O-level economics are taught that inflation is the result of too much money chasing too few goods, and when Tottenham feel compelled to spend \u00a35m on a defender, Ben Thatcher, from a relegated team, Wimbledon, the point is surely proved. Everybody, however, seems happy with the way things are. Only two things, in the main, could upset this sanguine state of affairs. One is a recession of sufficient severity to curtail the public's spending power and leave football with a lot of replica shirts on its hands, but there is no sign of this yet. The other is a stage at which BSkyB felt its coverage had reached such a point of saturation that no useful purpose would be served by forever upping the ante. If that happened a shudder would run through the game's balance sheets, but the process of soaking the viewers has barely begun. Fans will always moan about a losing team and few have ever had a good word to say about referees, but in general it seems that football can do no wrong. The England team may have failed in a major tournament under a coach whose only credentials appear to have been his popularity and ability to get on with the media, but England teams have flopped before without diminishing people's enthusiasm for a flawed but invigorating domestic game. The proliferation of foreign players, some outstanding, most merely competent, makes it easier for supporters to dissociate themselves from the mediocrity of the national team. Why worry about who will follow Alan Shearer in the England attack when your club has signed a talented Ukrainian, Sergei Rebrov, or a goalscoring Dutchman, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink? Fans are not daft. They know that technically the Premiership is not on a par with the leagues of Italy and Spain, but will insist that for action, incident and excitement it has no equals, an argument supported by the number of foreign countries who take the live TV coverage from English grounds. \"English football is at its best when our teams are playing each other,\" Ron Greenwood declared many years ago, and the domestic product continues to support this view. Terry Venables was also right when he said that the English game thrived on errors which became an embarrassment when repeated in international tournaments, a point well made by Kevin Keegan's team this summer. This is why, while Manchester United and Arsenal may be among the European clubs forever threatening to break away and form their own TV-orientated league, fans will take a great deal of persuading that such a competition could ever take precedence over the present scheme of things. In the longer term, domestic rivalries will always have more appeal than international rivalries. The Premiership remains a lead pencil with a gold top but few fans are complaining. And United will not stay top forever, even though it may take Sir Alex Ferguson's impending retirement to end their present domination. If he actually goes, that is.",

      "body": "<p>If many of the audience who turned up or tuned in to hear Mariss Jansons conduct the Oslo Philharmonic and Olga Borodina sing Berlioz's The Death of Cleopatra were initially disappointed - both had withdrawn from the concert - they should have gone away more than satisfied with the replacements. The Austrian-born Manfred Honeck, now the principal guest conductor in Oslo, took over the programme unchanged and the American mezzo Michelle DeYoung tackled the scena that Berlioz produced in 1829 in his third unsuccessful attempt to win the prestigious Prix de Rome </p> <p>DeYoung has always seemed to me a rather neutral, uninvolved performer before; no one has ever doubted the sumptuous quality of her voice - even, velvety, perfectly controlled - just the extent to which she engages with what she is singing. But Berlioz clearly suits her well; she's to be one of the soloists in Colin Davis's concert performances of The Trojans at the end of the year, and this wracked and touching account of Cleopatra's final throes suggested that will be well worth hearing. Every phrase was loaded with meaning, every syllable savoured, and the tragic grandeur built inexorably. Honeck's alert accompaniment reinforced it all too; he and the Oslo strings made sure that all of Berlioz's rangy, searching melodies had point and the right expressive purpose. </p> <p>The concert had begun with Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, lithe and purposeful, and never sounding over-loaded despite the size of the orchestral forces.

      "bodyText": "If many of the audience who turned up or tuned in to hear Mariss Jansons conduct the Oslo Philharmonic and Olga Borodina sing Berlioz's The Death of Cleopatra were initially disappointed - both had withdrawn from the concert - they should have gone away more than satisfied with the replacements. The Austrian-born Manfred Honeck, now the principal guest conductor in Oslo, took over the programme unchanged and the American mezzo Michelle DeYoung tackled the scena that Berlioz produced in 1829 in his third unsuccessful attempt to win the prestigious Prix de Rome DeYoung has always seemed to me a rather neutral, uninvolved performer before; no one has ever doubted the sumptuous quality of her voice - even, velvety, perfectly controlled - just the extent to which she engages with what she is singing. But Berlioz clearly suits her well; she's to be one of the soloists in Colin Davis's concert performances of The Trojans at the end of the year, and this wracked and touching account of Cleopatra's final throes suggested that will be well worth hearing. Every phrase was loaded with meaning, every syllable savoured, and the tragic grandeur built inexorably. Honeck's alert accompaniment reinforced it all too; he and the Oslo strings made sure that all of Berlioz's rangy, searching melodies had point and the right expressive purpose. The concert had begun with Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, lithe and purposeful, and never sounding over-loaded despite the size of the orchestral forces. It ended with Ravel's La Valse, which Honeck turned into a nightmarish vision of a society in freefall, always controlled, yet driving through to the final cataclysm with biting rhythms and scary determination. The Oslo Philharmonic's playing was superlative - every section of this great orchestra is very finely tuned indeed, and they showed that they are capable of great refinement as well as extreme virtuosity.

In his homeland Rebrov is widely regarded as a better player than Shevchenko, and his decision to move to White Hart Lane was guided by his Ukraine international strike partner's experience at Milan as well as by his impressions of Spurs from television, video and meetings with the management. </p> <p>\"There was a mutual respect and understanding,\" he stresses, \"and I saw in Tottenham the same qualities I saw at Dynamo Kiev.

As Ferguson resigned himself to getting neither the move to Goodison Park nor the lucrative pay-off he had been craving, Dennis Roach laid the blame squarely at Newcastle's door. Roach claimed that because Ferguson never asked for the transfer the player was entitled to compensation under the terms of his contract. \"If that had been rounded up to \u00a3250,000 that would have been all he wanted,\" he said. \"But we never had the opportunity to ask for that money, and because of that Duncan has decided to dig in his heels and will not be going anywhere.

He is now in an awkward position. \"It would not make me want to play for Newcastle any more but Duncan wants to put this behind him and he still believes the fans are on his side. Duncan feels he can put anyone out of the side and he has told me he will fight for his place.\" Ferguson's relationship with his current employers is now so acrimonious that he will undoubtedly take solace from the fact he has hit his club where it hurts most, in the wallet. By refusing to complete his transfer back to the Merseyside club Ferguson has, in essence, told Newcastle he is fully prepared to sit tight - possibly in the reserves - for the remaining three years of one of the most lucrative contracts in the history of British football. Having picked up a \u00a31m bonus after moving between Goodison Park and St James' Park in November 1998, the 28-year-old Ferguson has since been paid around \u00a338,000 a week. If he were to remain at Newcastle until his current deal expires in 2003, Ferguson would collect almost \u00a36m in wages, possibly without the inconvenience of actually playing senior football. Everton's patience finally ran out at lunchtime yesterday, some 24 hours after Ferguson had failed to show for a medical which would have paved the way for his \u00a33.75m return to what he has always described as his \"spiritual home\". Everton's manager Walter Smith said: \"Having agreed a deal with both parties on Friday we were very hopeful of signing Duncan.

</p> <p>250-299 (2); </p> <p>300-349 (3); </p> <p>350-399 (4); </p> <p>400 or over (5) </p> <p><strong> Bowling: now only 3 points available </strong> (4) </p> <p>three-five wickets (1); </p> <p>six-eight wickets (2); </p> <p>nine-ten (3). </p> <p>The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. </p> <p>A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. </p> <p>A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points. </p> <p>*Note: in a <strong> draw where the scores finish level</strong> , the side batting in the fourth innings earn 6 points their opponents 4, plus bonus points. </p> <p><strong> NATIONAL LEAGUE</strong> <strong> Second Division</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Warwickshire v Middlesex </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Edgbaston</strong> </p> <p><strong> MIDDLESEX</strong> </p> <p><strong> A J Strauss</strong> lbw b Welch <strong> 0</strong></p> <p><strong>D Alleyne</strong> c Penney b Welch <strong> 5 </strong></p> <p><strong>J L Langer</strong> run out <strong> 93 </strong></p> <p><strong>M R Ramprakash</strong> st Piper b Giles <strong> 37 </strong></p> <p><strong>E C Joyce</strong> c Penney b Brown <strong> 34 </strong></p> <p><strong>K P Dutch</strong> c Powell b Sheikh <strong> 3 </strong></p> <p><strong>S J Cook</strong> b Brown <strong> 10 </strong></p> <p><strong>R L Johnson</strong> b Brown <strong> 0</strong></p> <p><strong>P N Weekes</strong> run out <strong> 4 </strong></p> <p><strong>B L Hutton</strong> not out <strong> 5 </strong></p> <p><strong>T F Bloomfield</strong> not out <strong> 3 </strong></p> <p><strong>Extras</strong> (lb1, w6) <strong> 7 </strong></p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (for 9, 45 overs) <strong> 201 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fall:</strong> 0, 23, 91, 164, 167, 179, 179, 191, 195. </p> <p><strong> Bowling:</strong> Welch 9-1-32-2;

As before, a win earns 12 points , a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4) three-five wickets (1); six-eight wickets (2); nine-ten (3). The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points. *Note: in a draw where the scores finish level , the side batting in the fourth innings earn 6 points their opponents 4, plus bonus points.

Ronnie Irani was the bowler each time. </p> <p>Essex persevered and were periodically rewarded. Matt Windows and Kim Barnett, effective against Lancashire on Sunday, in turn moved the score on. But eventually Windows jabbed to short leg and Barnett was caught at gully. </p> <p>At that point there appeared to be plenty to come. Chris Taylor, in his first season of county cricket and impatient to reinforce the acclaim that accompanied his maiden hundred at Lord's, paraded several glorious shots, through mid wicket off Danny Law and guiding Such through the covers, before top-edging spinner Tim Mason to short fine leg. </p> <p>Mark Alleyne, shrugging off his back problem benefited from edges wide of slips against Irani. After a settled period and eight boundaries Alleyne played on to Ashley Cowan. </p> <p>Essex retained the initiative during the evening as Jack Russell was caught at silly point after an obdurate stand. Further, Ball was bowled by Such and Jon Lewis perished first ball to short leg.</p>",

But it was an encouraging start to the Colchester festival for Essex, who are well placed for promotion from their runners-up position in the Second Division. Success is likely to rest with the spinners, and Essex are playing three of them. Peter Such has already taken four wickets, having been on a hat-trick and ambling through overs with that craft that not long ago appeared to be going into obscurity. Gloucestershire perhaps are banking on Martyn Ball and Jeremy Snape, who is currently batting well and has to be dislodged this morning. Gloucestershire like to bat first and crack along. Their acquired one-day confidence seemed in evidence during the morning session, though Dominic Hewson disappeared, caught at second slip, and Tim Hancock, approaching his half-century, was out cutting to Graham Napier at cover. Ronnie Irani was the bowler each time. Essex persevered and were periodically rewarded. Matt Windows and Kim Barnett, effective against Lancashire on Sunday, in turn moved the score on. But eventually Windows jabbed to short leg and Barnett was caught at gully. At that point there appeared to be plenty to come. Chris Taylor, in his first season of county cricket and impatient to reinforce the acclaim that accompanied his maiden hundred at Lord's, paraded several glorious shots, through mid wicket off Danny Law and guiding Such through the covers, before top-edging spinner Tim Mason to short fine leg. Mark Alleyne, shrugging off his back problem benefited from edges wide of slips against Irani. After a settled period and eight boundaries Alleyne played on to Ashley Cowan. Essex retained the initiative during the evening as Jack Russell was caught at silly point after an obdurate stand. Further, Ball was bowled by Such and Jon Lewis perished first ball to short leg.",

      "body": "<p>Has the e-book arrived? This is the question nervous publishers have been asking themselves this week, after Microsoft unveiled the latest version of Microsoft Reader, the software for laptops, PCs and hand-held devices which aims to transfer the experience of reading from the written page to the computer screen.</p> <p>The move, described by Microsoft as equivalent to the creation of the first mass-produced motorcar, was timed to coincide with the launch of its eBookStore by the US internet bookseller <a href=\"http://www.bn.com\">Barnes &amp; Noble.com</a>. \"This is a major milestone for the publishing industry and book lovers alike,\" said Dick Brass, vice president for technology development at Microsoft. \"Anyone wondering about electronic reading needs only to spend some time with a good eBook on Microsoft Reader to see what the excitement is all about.\"</p> <p>Suggestions that the software could do to publishers what Napster and the MP3 have done to the music industry were rebutted by Microsoft, which said that it had joined up with the Association of American Publishers to fight digital piracy. The computer giant promised to put a \"significant financial endowment\" into creating new technology to identify illegal content on the net.</p> <p>In the US a number of publishers have jumped on the e-book bandwagon in recent months, including the giants Random House and Time Warner, both of which have established their own digital imprints. \"I believe that the eBook will change the whole notion of how we receive and enjoy information and entertainment,\" said a bullish Laurence Kirshbaum, chairman and CEO of Time Warner Trade Publishing.</p> <p>This latest \"major milestone\" was greeted with typical stiff upper lips in the UK, where publishers have yet to be convinced that the e-book will not go the same way as the ill-fated CD-rom.</p> <p>However, Microsoft's hyperbole aside, the fact that consumers the world over can now download books such as Michael Crichton's Disclosure or Kathy Reichs's Deadly Decisions for as little as $10 and read them using their preferred e-book software should not go unnoticed for too much longer in the UK. One of the books being heavily promoted by Barnes &amp; Noble.com, Jackie Collins's Lethal Seduction, will not be available in the UK in traditional book form until October. Replace Jackie Collins with JK Rowling and Lethal Seduction with Harry Potter Five and the potential threat is obvious.</p> <p>One British publisher which has decided to take a chance on e-books is the academic group Taylor &amp; Francis. They recently signed up with a US e-publishing company, Versaware, to publish new digital e-book formats alongside their conventional printed books. </p> <p>The company, whose imprints include Routledge and Garland, also intends to have an e-book version of its entire back catalogue by 2001. When asked why the group was taking this step now, managing director Roger Horton said \"the eBook is here, and the widespread use of the internet makes it much more accessible. We cannot continue to dip our toes into the digital stream... We had to take control of our content, its availability and distribution to position ourselves for the future.\" </p> <p> As if this was not enough for publishers, the Bookseller has reported that literary agents are also getting in on the act. According to the trade paper, Richard Gollner of Radala &amp; Associates is to publish The Wisdom of Crocodiles by Paul Hoffman on 29 August under his agency's own imprint, Big Time Press. According to Mr Gollner, the decision to publish was an experiment - but he warned that, with cheaper and easier printing methods now available, it was an experiment that could easily be repeated. In a show of net nous, the book - a section of which has already been made into an eponymous film starring Jude Law - is being promoted by a fiendishly difficult online competition at <a href=\"http://www.1234.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.1234.com</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, mind, body and spirit publisher Element, which has been suffering a long period of bad karma, could be about to join Fourth Estate at HarperCollins, Rupert Murdoch's rarely harmonic global publishing empire. The Bookseller reported that newly installed chief executive Victoria Barnsley has been courting the struggling purveyor of all things yin and yang. Ms Barnsley, it seems, would like to put it alongside HarperCollins' very own mind, body, spirit imprint, Thorsons.</p> <p>The rumour, if it proves to be true, should be of interest to Eileen Campbell, the publisher credited with being the inspiration behind Thorsons.

      "bodyText": "Has the e-book arrived? This is the question nervous publishers have been asking themselves this week, after Microsoft unveiled the latest version of Microsoft Reader, the software for laptops, PCs and hand-held devices which aims to transfer the experience of reading from the written page to the computer screen. The move, described by Microsoft as equivalent to the creation of the first mass-produced motorcar, was timed to coincide with the launch of its eBookStore by the US internet bookseller Barnes &amp; Noble.com. \"This is a major milestone for the publishing industry and book lovers alike,\" said Dick Brass, vice president for technology development at Microsoft. \"Anyone wondering about electronic reading needs only to spend some time with a good eBook on Microsoft Reader to see what the excitement is all about.\" Suggestions that the software could do to publishers what Napster and the MP3 have done to the music industry were rebutted by Microsoft, which said that it had joined up with the Association of American Publishers to fight digital piracy. The computer giant promised to put a \"significant financial endowment\" into creating new technology to identify illegal content on the net. In the US a number of publishers have jumped on the e-book bandwagon in recent months, including the giants Random House and Time Warner, both of which have established their own digital imprints. \"I believe that the eBook will change the whole notion of how we receive and enjoy information and entertainment,\" said a bullish Laurence Kirshbaum, chairman and CEO of Time Warner Trade Publishing. This latest \"major milestone\" was greeted with typical stiff upper lips in the UK, where publishers have yet to be convinced that the e-book will not go the same way as the ill-fated CD-rom. However, Microsoft's hyperbole aside, the fact that consumers the world over can now download books such as Michael Crichton's Disclosure or Kathy Reichs's Deadly Decisions for as little as $10 and read them using their preferred e-book software should not go unnoticed for too much longer in the UK. One of the books being heavily promoted by Barnes &amp; Noble.com, Jackie Collins's Lethal Seduction, will not be available in the UK in traditional book form until October. Replace Jackie Collins with JK Rowling and Lethal Seduction with Harry Potter Five and the potential threat is obvious. One British publisher which has decided to take a chance on e-books is the academic group Taylor &amp; Francis. They recently signed up with a US e-publishing company, Versaware, to publish new digital e-book formats alongside their conventional printed books. The company, whose imprints include Routledge and Garland, also intends to have an e-book version of its entire back catalogue by 2001. When asked why the group was taking this step now, managing director Roger Horton said \"the eBook is here, and the widespread use of the internet makes it much more accessible. We cannot continue to dip our toes into the digital stream... We had to take control of our content, its availability and distribution to position ourselves for the future.\" As if this was not enough for publishers, the Bookseller has reported that literary agents are also getting in on the act. According to the trade paper, Richard Gollner of Radala &amp; Associates is to publish The Wisdom of Crocodiles by Paul Hoffman on 29 August under his agency's own imprint, Big Time Press. According to Mr Gollner, the decision to publish was an experiment - but he warned that, with cheaper and easier printing methods now available, it was an experiment that could easily be repeated. In a show of net nous, the book - a section of which has already been made into an eponymous film starring Jude Law - is being promoted by a fiendishly difficult online competition at www.1234.com. Meanwhile, mind, body and spirit publisher Element, which has been suffering a long period of bad karma, could be about to join Fourth Estate at HarperCollins, Rupert Murdoch's rarely harmonic global publishing empire. The Bookseller reported that newly installed chief executive Victoria Barnsley has been courting the struggling purveyor of all things yin and yang. Ms Barnsley, it seems, would like to put it alongside HarperCollins' very own mind, body, spirit imprint, Thorsons. The rumour, if it proves to be true, should be of interest to Eileen Campbell, the publisher credited with being the inspiration behind Thorsons. Ms Campbell left HarperCollins earlier this year for Penguin, where her brief was to nurture a mind, body, spirit list. Penguin, which distributes Element's books in the UK, is thought to have backed away from an attempt to acquire Element itself. But then Penguin has been busy of late, not least in the company of lawyers. Fresh from the David Irving trial, the nation's favourite publisher has received a legal challenge from the owner of the domain name katie.com, after releasing a book in the US with the same title. The original Katie has been forced to take down her site and replace it with an open letter to Penguin, in which she says that the book was originally to have been called girl.com - presumably until someone twigged that it was an address for adult content. It seems Penguin could face further legal problems arising from the closure of Dorling Kindersley Family Learning (DKFL), the direct-selling arm of the company acquired by Penguin earlier this year. According to a report in Publishing News, a number of DKFL distributors, who feel they have been left high and dry by Penguin's decision to close the unit, are exploring their legal options. The numbers involved were not disclosed, but there were more than 30,000 such distributors when the division was culled. But it has not been a wholly bad week for Penguin.

But more boys take maths and physics and more girls take the two languages, which may to some extent explain the discrepancy.</p> <p>At advanced GNVQ, 15.4% of candidates won distinctions, compared with 13.5% last year.

The significant drop in modern language entries is evidence of a European isolationist attitude.\" John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"At a time when the country needs the maximum number of well-qualified modern linguists, it is perverse that A-level entry is decreasing.\" Paul Sokoloff, convenor of the Joint Council for General Qualifications, representing the exam boards of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said he hoped more students would take a modern language as a one of the four or five subjects they take at AS- level in the first year of sixth form. But Mr Dunford has already reported that pupils going into the sixth form next year seem far more likely to choose subjects like media studies and psychology. They were among those showing an increase in A-level entries this year, psychology by 5%, and media, film and TV studies by 7.4%. Psychology entries at AS-level rose by 29%. Mark Reid, of the British Film Institute's education department, said: \"The increase in the number of youngsters taking media studies reflects the strong interest in our cultural life. \"It is completely wrong to suggest that this is a subject which is not as challenging as others\". But computing and IT A-level entries rose by nearly 2,000 or 11.4% to 19,099. At AS-level entries rose by 25%. The most popular subjects were general studies, English, maths, biology and chemistry, with the top three remaining unchanged on last year. But of those, only general studies showed an increase in entries year on year. Geography was another big loser at A-level, with entries falling by 11.9%. There were increases in those taking A-levels in art and design, business studies, his tory, religious studies, physical education, technology and Welsh. But entries fell in classics, communications, economics, expressive arts, home economics, law, physics, politics and sociology. Nick Seaton, of the Campaign for Real Education, said: \"Youngsters need modern languages and geography to make their way in the world. The vast majority of people think media studies a waste of time.\" One of the arguments used by independent schools to justify their disproportionate intake to top universities is that more of their candidates take the harder A-level subjects. But Mr Solokoff said great efforts were made to ensure that A-level subjects were equally demanding. In a further twist to the gender divide, girls do better than boys in maths and physics but worse in French and Spanish. But more boys take maths and physics and more girls take the two languages, which may to some extent explain the discrepancy. At advanced GNVQ, 15.4% of candidates won distinctions, compared with 13.5% last year. Entries increased for computing and performing arts and dropped for business and leisure and tourism.",

      "body": "<p>Cyberlibertarians who saw the internet as a way of escaping the dead hand of central government must be disappointed. Many believed that the internet offered the ideal testing grounds for one of the most famous predictions of Friedrich Hayek, Mrs Thatcher's favourite economic guru, who suggested 25 years ago that private money would spontaneously arise as a credible alternative to legal tender issued by central banks. </p> <p>It is nearly five years since the first prototype digital currencies were launched, and a single currency for the internet has yet to emerge, spontaneously or otherwise. Early attempts to solve the money conundrum have not been a success. DigiCash, one of the pioneers in the field, went bankrupt nearly two years ago. Last year Barclays dropped its early experiment in the field, Barclaycoin, based on technology from the US firm Cybercoin, which has also abandoned the e-payments game and gone into payments security. </p> <p>These early systems were not new currencies - they relied on customers downloading software to install a digital wallet on their PC. The wallet could then be loaded up with transfers from the customer's bank account. Installing the software was a hassle and finding a website enabled to accept payments even more so. </p> <p>Credit cards have become the default payment system for e-commerce in the absence of a better option, but neither consumers nor merchants are happy. Consumers don't like trusting card details to websites. According to one recent survey, four in 10 UK consumers say they are reluctant to use their credit cards for purchases on the internet, even though security experts promise it is no more risky than giving a credit card number down the telephone or letting a waiter take a card out of sight when paying for a meal. The customer does not bear the major risk for fraudulent transactions whether online or in the real economy. </p> <p>Fraud is undoubtedly a problem online, but it is e-tailers - not customers - who are paying the heaviest price. Web sites offer would-be fraudsters programmes to download which will automatically generate valid card numbers. Other fraudsters trawl the net picking up credit card details stored on retailers' sites. </p> <p>Stolen credit numbers were used in 1.2% of US internet sales last year. Some analysts estimate e-tailers are 10 times more likely to be hit by fraud than offline retailers. In the UK, the main banks' clearing house, APCS, estimates online card fraud in 1999 to have equalled \u00a33.7m - or 2% of total card losses. </p> <p>The real sting for the merchants is that, unlike face to face card sales where the issuing bank bears the risk if the retailer takes reasonable precautions, with any kind of remote card transaction they are fully liable for the cost of the fraud. Not only do they lose the payment, but card companies bill them a $40 \"chargeback\" for accepting a fraudulent payment. </p> <p>Credit card issuers already charge web merchants more than real world retailers: 2.5% of sales, plus 30 cents per transaction as opposed to 1.5% plus 30 cents. All of this is cutting into web merchants' already slender profit margins. </p> <p>Swingeing transaction costs are one reason why cards are hopeless for small purchases - so-called micropayments. They are not much use either if you are trying to pay another individual rather than a retailer - as often happens on internet auction sites. </p> <p>A bewildering variety of payment systems has emerged as an alternative to credit cards. The sex sites, usually the leading edge for commercial exploitation of the internet, got out of credit card payments some time ago, crippled by fraud. Now they use different systems, including programmes which enable customers to add the cost of visiting the site to their phone bill, or use a third party which holds the customers details to guarantee that credit card payments are genuine. But such sites are themselves vulnerable to hackers. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.x.com/\">Paypal</a> promises to take the uncertainty out of person to person transactions - P2P in the jargon. Both parties register their credit card or bank account details, and payments are triggered by sending an email. Paypal will arrange for payments to be taken out of the buyer's account and transferred to the seller's. </p> <p>If you receive an email with money from Paypal, you have to sign up to the service to get it: a sure fire way of increasing the numbers using the system. But it too has recently fallen victim to fraudsters using false card numbers, and has promised to review its procedures. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.billpoint.com\">Billpoint</a> promises the same advantages for P2P payments on eBay, the web's leading auction site. The big players clearly think there is money to be made from P2P: US bank Wells Fargo has a 35% stake in Billpoint, while Paypal is part owned by Finnish mobile phone giant Nokia. </p> <p>For micro payments, the choice of payment methods is even more bewildering. Online rewards schemes like <a href=\"http://www.beenz.com\">Beenz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flooz.com\">Flooz</a> which pay people to surf are starting to look more like currencies as they become more widely accepted across the internet. </p> <p>Other schemes involve variations on the digital wallet: at <a href=\"http://www.y-creds.co.uk\">Y-creds</a>, parents can load pocket money into their offspring's accounts which can then be used to shop at a parent censored selection of online merchants. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.exchangepath.com\" target=\"_new\">ExchangePath</a>, formerly 1Clickcharge, a US site, offers prepaid accounts and P2P payments. </p> <p>The problem with these substitutes for credit cards is that there are too many of them. Consumers do not want to have to go shopping with a wallet full of dozens of different payment options, but so far there is no accepted standard on which to rely. </p> <p>David Birch, head of Consult Hyperion, a UK e-payments consultancy, says the race is on in the US and Europe to find secure, convenient solution to internet payments which will unlock the commercial potential of the internet. The ideal system would offer certain features: they would be: <br> \u0095 fraudproof <br> \u0095 private <br> \u0095 exchangeable for a wide range of goods and services <br> \u0095 a reliable store of value, not likely to be eroded by inflation <br> \u0095 downloadable for real economy purchases <br> \u0095 good for small as well as large transactions. </p> <p>US companies are racing to design software which offers these features, while in Europe the preferred solution is smart cards - where the security information is encoded on a chip rather than in the magnetic strip of the more familiar credit and debit cards. They can store credit card numbers so that the consumer does not need to give the information away over the net or the phone, or they can be loaded up with cash which can be used for small payments. </p> <p>Birch believes smart cards are the way forward because software solutions will always be vulnerable to hacking. While the security information on magnetic cards can easily be copied and stolen, the security on smart cards means that they have to be literally ripped apart before they give up their identifying information. </p> <p>With a smart card, users can pay for small and large purchases online without identifying themselves to the merchant - thus offering privacy. </p> <p>But to become the ubiquitous payment mechanism for the internet, smart cards require extra hardware - readers attached to PCs or set top boxes. M-commerce may well get a headstart over e-commerce simply because some mobile phones already come with readers installed. </p> <p>But for smart cards to evolve further, the big players have to get together to agree common standards. Brian Gladman, a former security expert for Nato, says the failure to agree common standards so far is because it involves two groups - bankers and technical experts - who don't understand each other. </p> <p>He believes that although the US hasn't shown much interest so far in smart cards, once they latch on to the technology, they are likely to race ahead of Europe, because their bankers are more technically literate. </p> <p>If smart cards become the prevailing mechanism for internet payments, it means the end of the dream of private money because the cards will link back to national currencies and to real time payment systems. </p> <p>True digital money would look very different to the account based systems which are developing as the standard. In an account based money system value is stored in the accounts of a trusted third party like a bank. Money is exchanged by taking from one person's account and transferring to another. </p> <p>True digital money would be based on a system where electronic tokens - an unforgeable packet of bits - are exchanged.

      "bodyText": "Cyberlibertarians who saw the internet as a way of escaping the dead hand of central government must be disappointed. Many believed that the internet offered the ideal testing grounds for one of the most famous predictions of Friedrich Hayek, Mrs Thatcher's favourite economic guru, who suggested 25 years ago that private money would spontaneously arise as a credible alternative to legal tender issued by central banks. It is nearly five years since the first prototype digital currencies were launched, and a single currency for the internet has yet to emerge, spontaneously or otherwise. Early attempts to solve the money conundrum have not been a success. DigiCash, one of the pioneers in the field, went bankrupt nearly two years ago. Last year Barclays dropped its early experiment in the field, Barclaycoin, based on technology from the US firm Cybercoin, which has also abandoned the e-payments game and gone into payments security. These early systems were not new currencies - they relied on customers downloading software to install a digital wallet on their PC. The wallet could then be loaded up with transfers from the customer's bank account. Installing the software was a hassle and finding a website enabled to accept payments even more so. Credit cards have become the default payment system for e-commerce in the absence of a better option, but neither consumers nor merchants are happy. Consumers don't like trusting card details to websites. According to one recent survey, four in 10 UK consumers say they are reluctant to use their credit cards for purchases on the internet, even though security experts promise it is no more risky than giving a credit card number down the telephone or letting a waiter take a card out of sight when paying for a meal. The customer does not bear the major risk for fraudulent transactions whether online or in the real economy. Fraud is undoubtedly a problem online, but it is e-tailers - not customers - who are paying the heaviest price. Web sites offer would-be fraudsters programmes to download which will automatically generate valid card numbers. Other fraudsters trawl the net picking up credit card details stored on retailers' sites. Stolen credit numbers were used in 1.2% of US internet sales last year. Some analysts estimate e-tailers are 10 times more likely to be hit by fraud than offline retailers. In the UK, the main banks' clearing house, APCS, estimates online card fraud in 1999 to have equalled \u00a33.7m - or 2% of total card losses. The real sting for the merchants is that, unlike face to face card sales where the issuing bank bears the risk if the retailer takes reasonable precautions, with any kind of remote card transaction they are fully liable for the cost of the fraud. Not only do they lose the payment, but card companies bill them a $40 \"chargeback\" for accepting a fraudulent payment. Credit card issuers already charge web merchants more than real world retailers: 2.5% of sales, plus 30 cents per transaction as opposed to 1.5% plus 30 cents. All of this is cutting into web merchants' already slender profit margins. Swingeing transaction costs are one reason why cards are hopeless for small purchases - so-called micropayments. They are not much use either if you are trying to pay another individual rather than a retailer - as often happens on internet auction sites. A bewildering variety of payment systems has emerged as an alternative to credit cards. The sex sites, usually the leading edge for commercial exploitation of the internet, got out of credit card payments some time ago, crippled by fraud. Now they use different systems, including programmes which enable customers to add the cost of visiting the site to their phone bill, or use a third party which holds the customers details to guarantee that credit card payments are genuine. But such sites are themselves vulnerable to hackers. Paypal promises to take the uncertainty out of person to person transactions - P2P in the jargon. Both parties register their credit card or bank account details, and payments are triggered by sending an email. Paypal will arrange for payments to be taken out of the buyer's account and transferred to the seller's. If you receive an email with money from Paypal, you have to sign up to the service to get it: a sure fire way of increasing the numbers using the system. But it too has recently fallen victim to fraudsters using false card numbers, and has promised to review its procedures. Billpoint promises the same advantages for P2P payments on eBay, the web's leading auction site. The big players clearly think there is money to be made from P2P: US bank Wells Fargo has a 35% stake in Billpoint, while Paypal is part owned by Finnish mobile phone giant Nokia. For micro payments, the choice of payment methods is even more bewildering. Online rewards schemes like Beenz and Flooz which pay people to surf are starting to look more like currencies as they become more widely accepted across the internet. Other schemes involve variations on the digital wallet: at Y-creds, parents can load pocket money into their offspring's accounts which can then be used to shop at a parent censored selection of online merchants. ExchangePath, formerly 1Clickcharge, a US site, offers prepaid accounts and P2P payments. The problem with these substitutes for credit cards is that there are too many of them. Consumers do not want to have to go shopping with a wallet full of dozens of different payment options, but so far there is no accepted standard on which to rely. David Birch, head of Consult Hyperion, a UK e-payments consultancy, says the race is on in the US and Europe to find secure, convenient solution to internet payments which will unlock the commercial potential of the internet. The ideal system would offer certain features: they would be: \u0095 fraudproof \u0095 private \u0095 exchangeable for a wide range of goods and services \u0095 a reliable store of value, not likely to be eroded by inflation \u0095 downloadable for real economy purchases \u0095 good for small as well as large transactions. US companies are racing to design software which offers these features, while in Europe the preferred solution is smart cards - where the security information is encoded on a chip rather than in the magnetic strip of the more familiar credit and debit cards. They can store credit card numbers so that the consumer does not need to give the information away over the net or the phone, or they can be loaded up with cash which can be used for small payments. Birch believes smart cards are the way forward because software solutions will always be vulnerable to hacking. While the security information on magnetic cards can easily be copied and stolen, the security on smart cards means that they have to be literally ripped apart before they give up their identifying information. With a smart card, users can pay for small and large purchases online without identifying themselves to the merchant - thus offering privacy. But to become the ubiquitous payment mechanism for the internet, smart cards require extra hardware - readers attached to PCs or set top boxes. M-commerce may well get a headstart over e-commerce simply because some mobile phones already come with readers installed. But for smart cards to evolve further, the big players have to get together to agree common standards. Brian Gladman, a former security expert for Nato, says the failure to agree common standards so far is because it involves two groups - bankers and technical experts - who don't understand each other. He believes that although the US hasn't shown much interest so far in smart cards, once they latch on to the technology, they are likely to race ahead of Europe, because their bankers are more technically literate. If smart cards become the prevailing mechanism for internet payments, it means the end of the dream of private money because the cards will link back to national currencies and to real time payment systems. True digital money would look very different to the account based systems which are developing as the standard. In an account based money system value is stored in the accounts of a trusted third party like a bank. Money is exchanged by taking from one person's account and transferring to another. True digital money would be based on a system where electronic tokens - an unforgeable packet of bits - are exchanged. Instead of relying on third party verification or on the banking system as a guarantee of value, in a token system, ownership is all - whoever has the token, has the money. Oakington, a British company, believes it may have developed the software platform which would allow other players to issue true digital currencies. The software is still being tested for bugs, but the company says it already has major e-tailers interested in the concept. Hayek's dream of companies challenging governments for the right to issue money may yet be realised.

      "body": "<b>What is Clearing?</b> <br> It's the service run by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) to match students without places with courses that still have vacancies. <p><b>Who uses Clearing?</b><br> Mostly students who have not gained the A-level or Highers grades they needed to meet conditional offers from their chosen university or college. Clearing can also be used to make a late application.</p> <p><b>How many students are involved?</b><br> Despite the hullabaloo, numbers have been falling from 54,401 in 1997 to 50,650 in 1998 and 48,239 last year, although this was partly accounted for by an increase in late registrations in the wake of controversy over tuition fees. People, especially mature students, seem to have waited to see what their financial position would be before applying. An increasing number of people apply very late in the day, often directly to one college or university, rather than going through the year-long applications process. </p> <p><b>How is it going this year?</b><br> By 11am on Thursday morning, 1,347 had found a course compared with around 2,500 at the same time in 1999. The numbers eligible for clearing were also down on last year, at 84,000 compared with 90,080. Far more students have got their first choice - this year conditional offers to a total of 190,793 people were confirmed. Many more will be able to negotiate entry to their first or second choice if they have missed the grades by a small margin. Institutions may well prefer to take a student they already know a bit about from their application.</p> <p><b>Who is eligible for Clearing?</b><br> Any applicant not holding an offer from a university or college. You must turn down any existing offer before Ucas will allow you into Clearing.</p> <p><b>What do applicants need to do?</b><br> If you are eligible for Clearing, you don't need to ask Ucas for details. They will send you a Clearing entry form (CEF) and instructions booklet automatically. Then it is up to students to take advice from teachers and career advisers and start contacting the universities and colleges about the courses that interest them. Ucas recommends that you telephone, e-mail or call in person and keep your CEF handy - you will probably be asked for your number and exam results. </p> <p><b>Is it a race?</b><br> Every year Clearing seems to become more frenetic. Yesterday morning the Ucas website registered 129,613 full searches. Young people hit the phones to universities and colleges as soon as they get their exam results - that is why there has been such a furore in Scotland where delayed Highers results could mean English and Welsh applicants get a head start in chasing the best courses.</p> <p><b>Will all the best courses will be snapped up by the first weekend after the A-level results?</b><br> Definitely not. A lot of informal offers are made at this stage. Student rings university A. \"Would you take me to study X with my grades?\" \"Yes,\" says the admissions tutor. Student rings university B, college C - possibly 10 or a dozen institutions to find the best offer. The upshot is that days and weeks pass before the true situation becomes clear. </p> <p><b>What do I do when a university or college offers me a place?</b><br> If an institution is happy that you meet its requirements, it will probably ask you to send it your CEF. Ucas advises: \"Don't be hasty. When someone asks for your CEF, they are, effectively, making you an offer. Make sure they are genuinely interested in your application. If you are sure the course is for you, fill in your CEF and send it off - or better still, take it there yourself. The best way to find out more about a university or college, its accommodation and social life, is to make a visit.\"</p> <p><b>Can I shop around?</b><br> Yes, but remember that your CEF can only be sent to one institution at a time. The university or college will insist that you send the original form, not a photocopy or fax. So if you're not convinced its course is for you, politely explain and carry on telephoning. </p> <p><b>How do I know if I've got a place?</b><br> When it has received your CEF, a university or college will write to you either to offer you a place or send back your form. If you decline the offer, or you do not get one, your CEF will be returned and you can keep looking. If you accept the offer, the university or college will confirm your place to Ucas and it will send you an official letter.</p> <p><b>How long does Clearing last?</b><br> You can get a place until the start of the academic term in September or even October but the majority of students get sorted out fairly quickly.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://clearing2000.guardianunlimited.co.uk/0,6835,149727,00.html\">Special report: Clearing 2000</a><br> </p>",

Despite the hullabaloo, numbers have been falling from 54,401 in 1997 to 50,650 in 1998 and 48,239 last year, although this was partly accounted for by an increase in late registrations in the wake of controversy over tuition fees. People, especially mature students, seem to have waited to see what their financial position would be before applying. An increasing number of people apply very late in the day, often directly to one college or university, rather than going through the year-long applications process. How is it going this year? By 11am on Thursday morning, 1,347 had found a course compared with around 2,500 at the same time in 1999. The numbers eligible for clearing were also down on last year, at 84,000 compared with 90,080. Far more students have got their first choice - this year conditional offers to a total of 190,793 people were confirmed. Many more will be able to negotiate entry to their first or second choice if they have missed the grades by a small margin. Institutions may well prefer to take a student they already know a bit about from their application. Who is eligible for Clearing? Any applicant not holding an offer from a university or college. You must turn down any existing offer before Ucas will allow you into Clearing. What do applicants need to do? If you are eligible for Clearing, you don't need to ask Ucas for details. They will send you a Clearing entry form (CEF) and instructions booklet automatically. Then it is up to students to take advice from teachers and career advisers and start contacting the universities and colleges about the courses that interest them. Ucas recommends that you telephone, e-mail or call in person and keep your CEF handy - you will probably be asked for your number and exam results. Is it a race? Every year Clearing seems to become more frenetic. Yesterday morning the Ucas website registered 129,613 full searches. Young people hit the phones to universities and colleges as soon as they get their exam results - that is why there has been such a furore in Scotland where delayed Highers results could mean English and Welsh applicants get a head start in chasing the best courses. Will all the best courses will be snapped up by the first weekend after the A-level results? Definitely not. A lot of informal offers are made at this stage. Student rings university A. \"Would you take me to study X with my grades?\" \"Yes,\" says the admissions tutor. Student rings university B, college C - possibly 10 or a dozen institutions to find the best offer. The upshot is that days and weeks pass before the true situation becomes clear. What do I do when a university or college offers me a place? If an institution is happy that you meet its requirements, it will probably ask you to send it your CEF. Ucas advises: \"Don't be hasty. When someone asks for your CEF, they are, effectively, making you an offer. Make sure they are genuinely interested in your application. If you are sure the course is for you, fill in your CEF and send it off - or better still, take it there yourself. The best way to find out more about a university or college, its accommodation and social life, is to make a visit.\" Can I shop around? Yes, but remember that your CEF can only be sent to one institution at a time. The university or college will insist that you send the original form, not a photocopy or fax. So if you're not convinced its course is for you, politely explain and carry on telephoning. How do I know if I've got a place? When it has received your CEF, a university or college will write to you either to offer you a place or send back your form. If you decline the offer, or you do not get one, your CEF will be returned and you can keep looking. If you accept the offer, the university or college will confirm your place to Ucas and it will send you an official letter. How long does Clearing last? You can get a place until the start of the academic term in September or even October but the majority of students get sorted out fairly quickly. Useful links Special report: Clearing 2000",

      "bodyText": "Backbenchers who are campaigning to reform the election process for picking the next Speaker of the Commons yesterday appealed for a 24 hour delay when MPs return to Westminster in the autumn so as to give them time to cross-examine the candidates. Gordon Prentice, the Labour backbencher who collected more than 100 signatures for reform on the final day of the summer term, wrote to the leader of the Commons, Margaret Beckett, who has herself declined calls to run for the job. Mr Prentice, MP for Pendle, asked for the extra time amid persistent fears that the existing method of picking the Speaker will not work in such a crowded field. Backbenchers on all sides, keen to protect their ancient right to pick \"one of our own\" to stand up against over-powerful governments like Tony Blair's or Margaret Thatcher's, are anxious to stage hustings on the first day that MPs return - October 23. There are up to 11 candidates, half of whom have already signalled a willingness to take part in informal hustings - including Tory MPs Sir Patrick Cormack and Nicholas Winterton and Labour's John McWilliam. Others are expected to follow suit. MPs fear that unless they can change the voting process - or get an extra day to cross-question candidates about issues like Commons modernisation - their only hope of avoiding a flawed election is for one or two candidates to emerge from the pack. That would make things easier. Michael \"Mick\" Martin, the 55-year-old former union official from Glasgow Springburn, is widely accepted to have made himself a popular frontrunner, though some Labour MPs say they would be happy to see a Conservative have the job - it is their \"turn\" - if an acceptable nominee emerges. None has done so. To complicate matters, as things stand the candidates get no chance to speak before the house votes. Instead their proposers speak and MPs choose between two candidates at a time until someone emerges a clear winner. With Betty Boothroyd, Speaker since 1992, saying she will stand down both as Speaker and an MP that day, the election is in the hands of 84-year-old Sir Edward Heath, former prime minister and father of the Commons. From his home in Salisbury he is listening to MPs who write to express their concerns, but is unlikely to initiate change in the election process at such a late stage. Ms Boothroyd's retirement plans caught most colleagues by surprise. To complicate the reformers plans further, they have booked a 140-seat committee room for hustings at Westminster for six hours on October 23, right up to the moment Sir Edward takes the chair at 2.30pm.

      "bodyText": "The contestants in Channel 4's real-life soap Big Brother were this morning preparing to confront fellow housemate 'Nasty' Nick Bateman, after rumbling his scheming ways. As midday approached, the three remaining female contestants, Anna, Mel and Nichola, were holed up in the girls bedroom of the Big Brother house along with Darren, discussing how to confront Nick. They also talked about the possibility of Nick being forced to leave the show. This morning's unfolding drama followed a night of confessions from Nick, according to a Sun Online report. The Sun site claimed to have been besieged by emails from furious Big Brother fans after the video and audio web feeds from the house were cut in the early hours of this morning. Online Big Brother viewers had been watching Craig, Tom, Anna and Mel discussing Nick's duplicitous ways. Craig threatened to \"knock him out\", according to the Sun Online report. Later, Craig and Darren were said to have been seen going through Nick's belongings and finding four pieces of paper with names written on them. The official Big Brother website made no reference to the morning's events.",

Jake's body was discovered less than a mile from the spot were he vanished on Sunday. Lifeboatmen recovered brought his body back to shore after it was spotted by the crew of a private yacht about a mile outside the harbour at Brancaster, near Hunstanton, Norfolk. Extensive searches by police, lifeboats and helicopters have been under way since Jake disappeared during a day trip to Norfolk with his parents Kevin and Debbie, his nine-year-old sister, Lauren, and another couple. Police said the schoolboy, who was paddling in the sea under the supervision of an aunt, disappeared without trace in the \"blink of an eye\". Shortly after she lost sight of Jake, his aunt raised the alarm and was joined by Jake's parents and sister who searched the beach for 25 minutes before calling for help. They stayed on the sand until 5.30pm before being driven away by the police to be given counselling. He is believed to have been swept to his death in a fast moving channel of water which crosses the sandy beach at low tide. Brancaster's strong current and hidden channels make it one of Britain's most dangerous beaches, with spring tide currents capable of knocking an adult off their feet. A police spokeswoman said Jake's family, who are being cared for by police liaison officers, had been informed. A police officer involved in the search for the schoolboy said: \"It is a tragedy that the search for Jake should end like this - but the chances of finding him alive were always very slim.\" The area where Jake disappeared is notorious for its strong underwater currents and fast moving tides which can easily cut off children far from shore. He went missing nearly four years to the day after Jodi Loughlin, six, and her brother Tom, four, from south London went missing on the beach four miles away at Holme-Next-The-Sea. Their bodies were found washed up two weeks later nearly 30 miles along the coast near Cromer.",

A superpower is bogged down in a distant guerrilla war. It must resupply its army (victorious for a generation) thousands of miles from home and it is very expensive.

      "body": "<p>At midnight last Friday, a curious email arrived at Consumer. \"We are pleased to announce that from Monday August 13 Safeway will be increasing prices on all our goods by 25%,\" it read. \"If this doesn't sound good to you then you can piss off to another supermarket chain such as Tesco or Sainsbury's.\" Safeway says that the message, which was sent to hundreds of customers who had logged on to the store's website, is being investigated. A spokeswoman assures: \"It was not issued by the company and the information it contained is entirely false.\" As if anyone could have doubted it. </p> <p>A disgruntled insider is the likeliest culprit, but it would come as no surprise to the industry if it was found to be the work of a rival store. </p> <p>Supermarket customers are used to having their favours fought over in increasingly bloody price wars, but the battle is starting to get dirty. The provocation is the US group Wal-mart, which last year took over the Asda chain and announced that it would reduce 10,000 lines by up to 10%. Its rivals, with brave dignity, professed to welcome the challenge and set about shearing the pennies off prices. Then, as the cost began to tell, the facade slipped and the squabbling started. Tesco declared it could match any ropey old deal offered by Safeway; Asda, not to be outdone, said the same. Then Tesco blew raspberries at Iceland who responded with rude stickers in Tesco stores. </p> <p>Safeway, meanwhile, was plotting revenge. \"We've got a new chief executive and his strategy is based on stealing other people's customers,\" its spokeswoman, Emma Mason told Consumer in May. An internal memo, leaked last week to a tabloid newspaper, revealed that the management was instructing its staff to wreak havoc in rival stores in the hope that, if customers don't defect to Safeway, at least they'll emerge with less than pleasant memories of their usual port of call. \"Be one jump ahead,\" operations director John Douglas urges his staff in the document. \"Make sure you know what they're up to and cause as much confusion as you possibly can.\" </p> <p>By way of inspiration, Douglas cites a recent triumph at Castle Bromwich in the West Midlands when a Safeway store manager sent 10 staff undercover to Asda. They all arrived at the check-outs simultaneously and demanded that the store match Safeway prices. \"The queues on the other tills were about 45ft long and people were dumping their baskets and leaving,\" boasted Safeway's Castle Bromwich manager. \"One customer was given his frozen food all for nothing because he waited so long.\" </p> <p>Safeway admits that it has set its sights on its rival - \"Ooh, it's exciting stuff!\" breathes communications director Kevin Hawkins - but claims Asda was horrid first. \"Some weeks ago they targeted our stores and said they would match our special offers if customers produced one of our advertisements,\" says Hawkins. \"We knew this was implausible becase it's impossible for them to predict which items we'll discount each week and so they can't make sure they've got enough stock to meet demand.\" </p> <p>To help dry up the supplies, Safeway staff are dropping thousands of leaflets a week in Asda car parks, inviting customers to take advantage of the offer. \"We've caught them out many a time this way,\" says Hawkins. \"We've told our managers that if they want to send staff round to challenge Asda in person, they can.\" </p> <p>At Asda, spokesman Nick Agarwal can barely suppress his mirth. \"We're bemused and amused,\" he chortles. \"Our customers would be the first to say that Safeway's tactics are a tad childish.\" </p> <p>Gaggles of self-conscious Safeway infiltrators are apparently such a familiar sight at Asda stores that managers have started welcoming them over the public address system and offering them their own designated check-out. \"They're not very good at undercover operations and often forget to change out of their uniforms,\" says Agarwal. </p> <p>\"At Rawtenstall in Lancashire they could only muster four staff who were still in uniform. Our manager saw them huddled in the carpark in the rain and took pity on them and gave them an Asda umbrella under which to shelter. He has now set up a hotline to Safeway in his store so that customers can call up and tell them what they think of them.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile Safeway's hit squads have been goading Tesco after the latter promised to match Safeway's special offers in its Wells and Walsall stores. Customers will have found leaflets promoting the Tesco deal under their windscreens, put there by Safeway staff who hoped a run on the discounted goods would empty Tesco's shelves. \"We're delighted that they are going to all that trouble to do our marketing for us,\" says Karen Marshall of Tesco. It's intensely competitive out there, but we would never resort to such tactics.\" </p> <p>Oh no? In May Iceland went weeping to the Office of Fair Trading after Tesco launched a \u00a320m poster campaign claiming that its prices were cheaper. \"Clearly they feel threatened by us to target us in such an underhand manner,\" says Iceland's managing director, Russell Ford. \"They recently experienced their first year-on-year fall in sales for three years and are clearly feeling the pressure.\" Iceland retaliated by pasting stickers on Tesco's frozen food counters, which read: \"Pssst, it's cheaper at Iceland.\" </p> <p>Sainsbury's says it prefers the grown-up approach and leaves such juvenile cavortings to its rivals. \"We fight with competitive prices and good quality,\" says a spokesman. This did not prevent the group from trying to pull a fast one on Safeway. When the latter announced that it was scrapping its ABC loyalty card in May, Sainsbury's promised 500 free points to customers who traded in their card for its equivalent. </p> <p>Each supermarket group claims that the others are motivated by jealousy. \"We've acquired a million new customers in a year and are obviously hurting Asda,\" crows Hawkins. And according to Asda: \"Safeway's tactics are a compliment. They obviously see us as a threat.\" </p> <p>Tesco says its rivals are intimidated by its \u00a3380m investment in price cuts last year, while little Iceland believes its 16% share of the frozen food market has discomfited Tesco. However, beneath the bravado the supermarkets are running scared. \"We are a 300lb gorilla,\" warned Wal-Mart when it arrived in Britain last June, and the predictions are that it will consume whatever chains it can lay its hands on. At present, three quarters of the population buys its groceries from the Big Four - Safeway, Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury; the fear is that Wal-Mart, with its global purchasing power and sheer magnitude, will swallow their profits. </p> <p>For as long as the battle wages, it can only be good news for consumers. Prices will continue to drop as stores bribe shoppers for their custom. Now the gloves are off, the inter-store warfare is likely to become ever more diverting. </p> <p>\"Asda says our tactics don't hurt them, but they would, wouldn't they,\" says Hawkins. \"We will continue to target them for as long as it takes. It's tit for tat.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "At midnight last Friday, a curious email arrived at Consumer. \"We are pleased to announce that from Monday August 13 Safeway will be increasing prices on all our goods by 25%,\" it read. \"If this doesn't sound good to you then you can piss off to another supermarket chain such as Tesco or Sainsbury's.\" Safeway says that the message, which was sent to hundreds of customers who had logged on to the store's website, is being investigated. A spokeswoman assures: \"It was not issued by the company and the information it contained is entirely false.\" As if anyone could have doubted it. A disgruntled insider is the likeliest culprit, but it would come as no surprise to the industry if it was found to be the work of a rival store. Supermarket customers are used to having their favours fought over in increasingly bloody price wars, but the battle is starting to get dirty. The provocation is the US group Wal-mart, which last year took over the Asda chain and announced that it would reduce 10,000 lines by up to 10%. Its rivals, with brave dignity, professed to welcome the challenge and set about shearing the pennies off prices. Then, as the cost began to tell, the facade slipped and the squabbling started. Tesco declared it could match any ropey old deal offered by Safeway; Asda, not to be outdone, said the same. Then Tesco blew raspberries at Iceland who responded with rude stickers in Tesco stores. Safeway, meanwhile, was plotting revenge. \"We've got a new chief executive and his strategy is based on stealing other people's customers,\" its spokeswoman, Emma Mason told Consumer in May. An internal memo, leaked last week to a tabloid newspaper, revealed that the management was instructing its staff to wreak havoc in rival stores in the hope that, if customers don't defect to Safeway, at least they'll emerge with less than pleasant memories of their usual port of call. \"Be one jump ahead,\" operations director John Douglas urges his staff in the document. \"Make sure you know what they're up to and cause as much confusion as you possibly can.\" By way of inspiration, Douglas cites a recent triumph at Castle Bromwich in the West Midlands when a Safeway store manager sent 10 staff undercover to Asda. They all arrived at the check-outs simultaneously and demanded that the store match Safeway prices. \"The queues on the other tills were about 45ft long and people were dumping their baskets and leaving,\" boasted Safeway's Castle Bromwich manager. \"One customer was given his frozen food all for nothing because he waited so long.\" Safeway admits that it has set its sights on its rival - \"Ooh, it's exciting stuff!\" breathes communications director Kevin Hawkins - but claims Asda was horrid first. \"Some weeks ago they targeted our stores and said they would match our special offers if customers produced one of our advertisements,\" says Hawkins. \"We knew this was implausible becase it's impossible for them to predict which items we'll discount each week and so they can't make sure they've got enough stock to meet demand.\" To help dry up the supplies, Safeway staff are dropping thousands of leaflets a week in Asda car parks, inviting customers to take advantage of the offer. \"We've caught them out many a time this way,\" says Hawkins. \"We've told our managers that if they want to send staff round to challenge Asda in person, they can.\" At Asda, spokesman Nick Agarwal can barely suppress his mirth. \"We're bemused and amused,\" he chortles. \"Our customers would be the first to say that Safeway's tactics are a tad childish.\" Gaggles of self-conscious Safeway infiltrators are apparently such a familiar sight at Asda stores that managers have started welcoming them over the public address system and offering them their own designated check-out. \"They're not very good at undercover operations and often forget to change out of their uniforms,\" says Agarwal. \"At Rawtenstall in Lancashire they could only muster four staff who were still in uniform. Our manager saw them huddled in the carpark in the rain and took pity on them and gave them an Asda umbrella under which to shelter. He has now set up a hotline to Safeway in his store so that customers can call up and tell them what they think of them.\" Meanwhile Safeway's hit squads have been goading Tesco after the latter promised to match Safeway's special offers in its Wells and Walsall stores. Customers will have found leaflets promoting the Tesco deal under their windscreens, put there by Safeway staff who hoped a run on the discounted goods would empty Tesco's shelves. \"We're delighted that they are going to all that trouble to do our marketing for us,\" says Karen Marshall of Tesco. It's intensely competitive out there, but we would never resort to such tactics.\" Oh no? In May Iceland went weeping to the Office of Fair Trading after Tesco launched a \u00a320m poster campaign claiming that its prices were cheaper. \"Clearly they feel threatened by us to target us in such an underhand manner,\" says Iceland's managing director, Russell Ford. \"They recently experienced their first year-on-year fall in sales for three years and are clearly feeling the pressure.\" Iceland retaliated by pasting stickers on Tesco's frozen food counters, which read: \"Pssst, it's cheaper at Iceland.\" Sainsbury's says it prefers the grown-up approach and leaves such juvenile cavortings to its rivals. \"We fight with competitive prices and good quality,\" says a spokesman. This did not prevent the group from trying to pull a fast one on Safeway. When the latter announced that it was scrapping its ABC loyalty card in May, Sainsbury's promised 500 free points to customers who traded in their card for its equivalent. Each supermarket group claims that the others are motivated by jealousy. \"We've acquired a million new customers in a year and are obviously hurting Asda,\" crows Hawkins. And according to Asda: \"Safeway's tactics are a compliment. They obviously see us as a threat.\" Tesco says its rivals are intimidated by its \u00a3380m investment in price cuts last year, while little Iceland believes its 16% share of the frozen food market has discomfited Tesco. However, beneath the bravado the supermarkets are running scared. \"We are a 300lb gorilla,\" warned Wal-Mart when it arrived in Britain last June, and the predictions are that it will consume whatever chains it can lay its hands on. At present, three quarters of the population buys its groceries from the Big Four - Safeway, Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury; the fear is that Wal-Mart, with its global purchasing power and sheer magnitude, will swallow their profits. For as long as the battle wages, it can only be good news for consumers. Prices will continue to drop as stores bribe shoppers for their custom. Now the gloves are off, the inter-store warfare is likely to become ever more diverting. \"Asda says our tactics don't hurt them, but they would, wouldn't they,\" says Hawkins. \"We will continue to target them for as long as it takes. It's tit for tat.\"",

He entered to the music from Chariots of Fire, greeted the audience with an improbable clenched fist salute and started his speech with a Jewish mother-in-law joke.</p> <p>But in contrast to his campaign appearances last week, this time Mr Lieberman dwelled only lightly on religious themes or the significance of his selection to American Jews and immigrants. It was a speech which set out to do four things. First, it had to introduce the still largely unknown Mr Lieberman to the wider national audience in a rare prime-time television opportunity. Second, it had to help promote Al Gore's generally lack-lustre public image - a major theme of this third day of the Democratic convention.</p> <p>Beyond these core tasks, the speech had to fulfil two potentially contradictory aims. It had to win the support of the black American electorate, a crucial Democratic base, but one which cannot be counted on to support a Jewish candidate. Simultaneously, the speech had to reach out beyond the party, to independent and undecided voters who needed to be given some reasons for preferring Gore-Lieberman to the Republicans' Bush-Cheney ticket.</p> <p>The first two objectives were easily fulfilled, Americans have no excuse for not knowing the key elements in the Lieberman narrative these days - the modest background in Connecticut, the days in the civil rights movement campaigning to register black voters, the abiding importance of his mother Marcia, the marriage to Hadassah Freilich, a daughter of Holocaust survivors, the assaults on Hollywood's debauched standards, then the attack on Mr Clinton over the Lewinsky affair.</p> <p>Last night the television audience heard nice stories from and about Joe Lieberman. And no one tuning in to the Democratic convention could doubt that he supports and promotes Mr Gore. After meeting the vice-president on one occasion, Mr Lieberman's young daughter said \"He must be a daddy\".</p> <p>Al Gore's virtues as a father were a constant theme of yesterday's sessions. Politically, though, there were other jobs to do. \"Let me just speak to those of you at home who haven't made up your mind if you want to build on our prosperity,\" Mr Lieberman said, before highlighting bi-partisanship and political reform as two key areas tailored to appeal to independents.</p> <p>\"I respectfully say to you that Al Gore and I are the guys who are ready to do the job,\" he said, At various points in his speech, Mr Lieberman praised Republican leaders like Ronald Reagan. He stressed his senate reputation as an \"across the aisle\" legislator, who had worked with Republicans in the past and who was happy to do so again.</p> <p>\"Our opponents are decent and likeable men,\" he said. \"I am pleased to call many in their party my friends.\" He praised \"my dear friend John McCain\" - the Arizona senator was diagnosed with skin cancer yesterday - and labelled him a great man.</p> <p>In the coming election, this appeal to the centre and to independents will surely be one of Mr Lieberman's responsibilities. The senator's quirky and unconventional voting record has raised some questions - especially among black leaders - about whether he will win over their support.</p> <p>In two warm-up speeches congressmen Robert Menendez, a Latino from New Jersey, and the formidable John Lewis of Georgia, who is black, fought to promote Mr Lieberman's anti-racist record. Meanwhile the man himself went out of his way to restate his support for affirmative action, as he had also done earlier at a meeting with the congressional black caucus.</p> <p>At the end, the Liebermans were bustled off the stage to prepare the way for Karenna Gore and Tommy Lee Jones to nominate Mr Gore for the election, and later for Mr Gore to make a surprise appearance himself, prior to being formally adopted.</p> <p>But the impact that the senator has made on the polls in just a few days has been good for the Democrats, and yesterday's speech is surely destined to push the party forward still further, as Mr Lieberman road tests his own considerable assets under campaign conditions.</p>",

Simultaneously, the speech had to reach out beyond the party, to independent and undecided voters who needed to be given some reasons for preferring Gore-Lieberman to the Republicans' Bush-Cheney ticket. The first two objectives were easily fulfilled, Americans have no excuse for not knowing the key elements in the Lieberman narrative these days - the modest background in Connecticut, the days in the civil rights movement campaigning to register black voters, the abiding importance of his mother Marcia, the marriage to Hadassah Freilich, a daughter of Holocaust survivors, the assaults on Hollywood's debauched standards, then the attack on Mr Clinton over the Lewinsky affair. Last night the television audience heard nice stories from and about Joe Lieberman. And no one tuning in to the Democratic convention could doubt that he supports and promotes Mr Gore. After meeting the vice-president on one occasion, Mr Lieberman's young daughter said \"He must be a daddy\". Al Gore's virtues as a father were a constant theme of yesterday's sessions. Politically, though, there were other jobs to do. \"Let me just speak to those of you at home who haven't made up your mind if you want to build on our prosperity,\" Mr Lieberman said, before highlighting bi-partisanship and political reform as two key areas tailored to appeal to independents. \"I respectfully say to you that Al Gore and I are the guys who are ready to do the job,\" he said, At various points in his speech, Mr Lieberman praised Republican leaders like Ronald Reagan. He stressed his senate reputation as an \"across the aisle\" legislator, who had worked with Republicans in the past and who was happy to do so again. \"Our opponents are decent and likeable men,\" he said. \"I am pleased to call many in their party my friends.\" He praised \"my dear friend John McCain\" - the Arizona senator was diagnosed with skin cancer yesterday - and labelled him a great man. In the coming election, this appeal to the centre and to independents will surely be one of Mr Lieberman's responsibilities. The senator's quirky and unconventional voting record has raised some questions - especially among black leaders - about whether he will win over their support. In two warm-up speeches congressmen Robert Menendez, a Latino from New Jersey, and the formidable John Lewis of Georgia, who is black, fought to promote Mr Lieberman's anti-racist record. Meanwhile the man himself went out of his way to restate his support for affirmative action, as he had also done earlier at a meeting with the congressional black caucus. At the end, the Liebermans were bustled off the stage to prepare the way for Karenna Gore and Tommy Lee Jones to nominate Mr Gore for the election, and later for Mr Gore to make a surprise appearance himself, prior to being formally adopted. But the impact that the senator has made on the polls in just a few days has been good for the Democrats, and yesterday's speech is surely destined to push the party forward still further, as Mr Lieberman road tests his own considerable assets under campaign conditions.",

The bouncy musical starring O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds, both fresh from Singin' In The Rain, was one of those irresistibly engaging, lightweight pictures that Weis made early in his career. At MGM in the 1950s, the accent was on youth, and Weis, in his early 30s, was given the chance to work with vigorous young performers. He was still aiming at the youth market a decade later - directing \"beach party\" movies.</p> <p>Weis entered the film industry as a Warner Bros messenger boy after studying film at the University of Southern California. After wartime service with the US Army Air Force, he worked as scriptwriter, dialogue director and assistant, mostly on Stanley Kramer-produced movies. A greater contrast between Kramer's strained seriousness and Weis's carefree pictures would be hard to find.</p> <p>His first film as director was Bannerline (1951), a likeable newspaper story starring the forgotten Keefe Brasselle as a cub reporter exposing small-town corruption. Afterwards, Weis was among six other directors on It's A Big Country (1952), an episodic patriotic picture praising the diversity of Americans with hardly a black face in sight. His sketch was a comic one featuring Brasselle and squawking Marjorie Main.</p> <p>There followed two cute little 1952 comedies starring the charming, but talentless Peter Lawford: Just This Once, with Janet Leigh, and You For Me, with Jane Greer. I Love Melvin, one of Weis's best pictures, had O'Connor as a photographer's assistant who rashly promises star-struck Reynolds the chance to appear on the cover of Look magazine. The film contained winning performances and witty dance routines staged by Robert Alton.</p> <p>The Affairs of Dobie Gillis (1953) - also starring Reynolds, accompanied by dynamic dancers Bobby Van and Bob Fosse, all as college kids - almost outdid I Love Melvin in exuberance. Debbie sings All I Do Is Dream Of You, as she did in Singin' In The Rain, and there is a number performed by a sextet of middle-aged women calling themselves Happy Stella Kowalski And Her Schottische Five.</p> <p>His contract up at MGM, Weis kicked off as a freelance with the hugely entertaining The Adventures of Hadji Baba (1954), in which dashingly handsome John Derek rescues a sheik's daughter from a forced marriage.</p> <p>Weis then disappeared into television, emerging from time to time to make feature films, including Mr Pharaoh And His Cleopatra (1959), made in Cuba and never released. In the same year, he directed The Gene Krupa Story, unaccountably star ring vulnerable, baby-faced Sal Mineo as the great jazz drummer, whose life was more interesting than this biopic suggested.</p> <p>The stagy Critic's Choice (1963), based on Ira Levin's play and starring Bob Hope and Lucille Ball, revolved around the unlikely event of a theatre critic having to review his wife's play objectively. Looking For Love (1964) had pop singer Connie Francis, as a switchboard operator with showbusiness aspirations, singing seven songs.</p> <p>Another bubble gum movie was Pajama Party (1964); Martian Tommy Kirk drops in on earth teens and joins in their mindless activities. It was sad to see 69-year-old Buster Keaton running around as Chief Rotten Eagle, just as it was to see 79-year-old Boris Karloff playing a corpse hoping to get into heaven in The Ghost In The Invisible Bikini (1966), the seventh, final beach party movie.</p> <p>Just as grisly, but less amusing, was Billie (1966), about a tomboyish teenager (Patty Duke) who can outperfom the boys in the high school's athletic team. This embarrasses her father, who is running for mayor on a \"male supremacy\" platform. The movie's pro-feminism finally yields to male brow-beating.</p> <p>After the ghastly Did You Hear The One About The Travelling Saleslady? (1968) starring the utterly unfunny Phyllis Diller, Weis returned to television permanently.

      "bodyText": "In I Love Melvin (1953), Donald O'Connor (pictured) on roller skates, sings \"Life has its funny little ups and downs\", which could serve as an anthem for the film's director, Don Weis, who has died aged 78. The bouncy musical starring O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds, both fresh from Singin' In The Rain, was one of those irresistibly engaging, lightweight pictures that Weis made early in his career. At MGM in the 1950s, the accent was on youth, and Weis, in his early 30s, was given the chance to work with vigorous young performers. He was still aiming at the youth market a decade later - directing \"beach party\" movies. Weis entered the film industry as a Warner Bros messenger boy after studying film at the University of Southern California. After wartime service with the US Army Air Force, he worked as scriptwriter, dialogue director and assistant, mostly on Stanley Kramer-produced movies. A greater contrast between Kramer's strained seriousness and Weis's carefree pictures would be hard to find. His first film as director was Bannerline (1951), a likeable newspaper story starring the forgotten Keefe Brasselle as a cub reporter exposing small-town corruption. Afterwards, Weis was among six other directors on It's A Big Country (1952), an episodic patriotic picture praising the diversity of Americans with hardly a black face in sight. His sketch was a comic one featuring Brasselle and squawking Marjorie Main. There followed two cute little 1952 comedies starring the charming, but talentless Peter Lawford: Just This Once, with Janet Leigh, and You For Me, with Jane Greer. I Love Melvin, one of Weis's best pictures, had O'Connor as a photographer's assistant who rashly promises star-struck Reynolds the chance to appear on the cover of Look magazine. The film contained winning performances and witty dance routines staged by Robert Alton. The Affairs of Dobie Gillis (1953) - also starring Reynolds, accompanied by dynamic dancers Bobby Van and Bob Fosse, all as college kids - almost outdid I Love Melvin in exuberance. Debbie sings All I Do Is Dream Of You, as she did in Singin' In The Rain, and there is a number performed by a sextet of middle-aged women calling themselves Happy Stella Kowalski And Her Schottische Five. His contract up at MGM, Weis kicked off as a freelance with the hugely entertaining The Adventures of Hadji Baba (1954), in which dashingly handsome John Derek rescues a sheik's daughter from a forced marriage. Weis then disappeared into television, emerging from time to time to make feature films, including Mr Pharaoh And His Cleopatra (1959), made in Cuba and never released. In the same year, he directed The Gene Krupa Story, unaccountably star ring vulnerable, baby-faced Sal Mineo as the great jazz drummer, whose life was more interesting than this biopic suggested. The stagy Critic's Choice (1963), based on Ira Levin's play and starring Bob Hope and Lucille Ball, revolved around the unlikely event of a theatre critic having to review his wife's play objectively. Looking For Love (1964) had pop singer Connie Francis, as a switchboard operator with showbusiness aspirations, singing seven songs. Another bubble gum movie was Pajama Party (1964); Martian Tommy Kirk drops in on earth teens and joins in their mindless activities. It was sad to see 69-year-old Buster Keaton running around as Chief Rotten Eagle, just as it was to see 79-year-old Boris Karloff playing a corpse hoping to get into heaven in The Ghost In The Invisible Bikini (1966), the seventh, final beach party movie. Just as grisly, but less amusing, was Billie (1966), about a tomboyish teenager (Patty Duke) who can outperfom the boys in the high school's athletic team. This embarrasses her father, who is running for mayor on a \"male supremacy\" platform. The movie's pro-feminism finally yields to male brow-beating. After the ghastly Did You Hear The One About The Travelling Saleslady? (1968) starring the utterly unfunny Phyllis Diller, Weis returned to television permanently. He redeemed himself, especially by directing more than 40 episodes of M*A*S*H in the 1970s, winning six Directors Guild of America Awards as the year's best television director. He also directed dozens of Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Perry Mason, Love Boat and Fantasy Island episodes. He is survived by his wife, the actress Rebecca Welles; two daughters, a stepdaughter and two grandchildren. \u0095 Don Weis, film and television director; born May 13 1922; died July 26 2000",

What do they rate as the best Test bowling? </strong>asks Andrew Curry </p> <p>We asked Rob Eastaway, one of the compilers of the PwC Ratings, for the official line: </p> <p>\"In the PwC Test Ratings, a bowling performance is adjusted to account for the actual batsmen the bowler dismissed and the level of scoring in the match. If a bowler takes 5 for 100 in a high-scoring match, having dismissed the top batsmen in the order, these figures might be converted to something like 7 for 80. These figures are then combined with the player's previous rating to give him a new one, in the same way as his conventional figures are combined with an old average to make a new one. All this means it is not easy to say for certain whether 7 for 80 would improve a player's rating more than, say, 8 for 100. </p> <p>\"However, I would estimate that the bowling figures that would have been given the highest value would have been Jim Laker's 19 for 90 at Old Trafford in 1956 (surprise, surprise). In more recent times, when the effect of the weather on conditions has not been so pronounced, Michael Holding's 14 for 149 (The Oval, 1976) look like they probably get the highest valuation - the level of runscoring in that match was relatively high, so in context his figures were outstanding. </p> <p>\"Incidentally, it is not quite right to say that Gooch's 154* is the highest-rated Test innings of all time. The PwC Ratings give it the highest value of any played since the last war, but Don Bradman's 270 v England at Melbourne in 1936-37 actually gets rated higher in the context of its match. The other top-rated innings since the war were Garry Sobers's 365* in 1957-58 and Brian Lara's 213 against Australia early last year. </p> <p>\"There's one final point I always like to make when talking about 'best' innings. The Ratings take into account some important factors within a match, but what they can't do is take into account some of the wider context of a performance. Sometimes an innings is great because a batsman is under pressure for other reasons: Mike Atherton's 99 at Headingley in 1994, after the ball-tampering business, and Mark Taylor's century at Edgbaston in 1997 after a long run of low scores spring to mind. So PwC's preference is to say that Gooch's was the 'best-rated' innings since the war, rather than the 'best' one, which would be a very arrogant assertion.\" </p> <p><strong> I'm stumped by a quiz question: What was started at the Longwood Cricket Club, which I'm assuming is an English club, or maybe a New Zealand one?</strong> asks Ants </p> <p>Actually it's not an English club or a New Zealand one - and it's not even a cricket question! Longwood Cricket Club is in Boston, in the United States, and its main claim to fame is that the first match in the Davis Cup, tennis's inter-nations competition, was played there, in August 1900. The USA beat the British Isles to become the first winners of the trophy, which was donated by Dwight Davis, one of the successful American team. Cricket was quite popular in North America at the end of the 19th century, which is why there are quite a few places there with \"Cricket Club\" in the title. Another of them, the Merion Cricket and Golf Club, has played host to golf's US Open on a number of occasions. </p> <p><strong> I am trying to plan a holiday around the next England tour of the West Indies, specifically the Antigua Test.

On the last two England tours, the Test series have finished with back-to-back matches in Barbados and Antigua. In 1993-94 the Antigua Test started on April 16, and in 1997-98 it began on March 20 (it was a little earlier because it was followed by six one-day internationals), if that's any help. </p> <p><strong> Which sides did Jack Pettiford play for?</strong> asks Gooch </p> <p>John \"Jack\" Pettiford, who was born in Freshwater near Sydney on Nov 29, 1919, was a tall middle-order batsman and a legspin bowler. He played 16 matches for New South Wales, starting in 1946-47. He was a member of the popular Australian Services team which toured England (and later India and Ceylon) in 1945. He also went to India and Pakistan with a strong Commonwealth XI in 1949-50. He played Lancashire League cricket in England for Nelson and Oldham, and then signed up for Kent. In 1954, his first season, he topped their averages, and also made his highest score - 133 v Essex at Blackheath. Pettiford played for Kent until 1959, by which time he had scored 7077 runs (average 25.64) and taken 295 wickets (31.38) in first-class cricket. He returned to Australia, but was only 44 when he died of a heart attack in Sydney on Oct 11, 1964. </p> <p><strong> During a recent cricket coaching session at Hertfordshire University my son was coached by a Nottinghamshire player whose surname he thinks was Sylvester. Can you tell me anything about him? </strong> asks Robin Aley </p> <p>I think the player your son met was Steven Anthony \"Steve\" Sylvester. He was a left-arm fast bowler who played a few matches for Middlesex and also spent some time on Nottinghamshire's books. He also played Minor County cricket for Buckinghamshire (he was born there in 1968). </p> <p><strong> Where will England be touring this winter?

Make no mistake, those welcoming and ever-so-helpful second-years, eager to help you with your luggage, are there, quite simply, to hunt for prey. Arrive at university in a low-cut T-shirt and extra-tight trousers and, although you will not have to carry any of your bags up the five flights of stairs to your shoebox room, you will find it difficult to shake off the sadder, lechier elements in the years above for the next few weeks. </p> <p>Many freshers make the schoolboy error of dressing as A Student. Ripped T-shirts and baggy combats, ethnic trousers and sandals, tight jeans and colourful jumpers are all looks favoured by those carefully cultivating the student look. Forget it - throughout your first year you'll be so busy trying to remember your next door neighbour's name, the time of your lectures and where the decent pubs are, the last thing you need to worry about is how to maintain a particular look. </p> <p>The one piece of sartorial advice you may need can be summed up in two words: elasticated waists. The combination of social drinking, chip suppers and general slothfulness guarantees a slight expansion of girth during your university career. Americans, bless 'em, even have a term for this - The Freshman Ten, as in the ten pounds you put on during your first year. </p> <p>But like many clich\u00e9s, The Student does contain an element of truth. Any first-year boy who does not bring a guitar, ready to impress his new friends with Paranoid Android or a riff from The White Album, may well have his masculinity questioned, and first-year girls are single-handedly responsible for keeping the incense-stick business burning in this country. Speaking of music, do not forget your CD (or, for extra cred, vinyl) collection. But even this needs careful forethought. One generalisation that can be made about students is that they all judge a potential friend by their music collection. The ritual is, they sift through your album collection as you perch nervously on your duvet (attractively patterned or solidly coloured, never decorated with a cartoon animal). Ironic music may still be the dernier cri, but while The Jackson Five and Shirley Bassey are acceptable, Drivetime 5 and Milli Vanilli are not. </p> <p>But let's get to the basics. The first thing any sensible 18-year-old leaving home thinks about is food. You are what you eat, so the student whose store cupboard houses a stale economy white loaf, an open tin of mouldering sardines and a half-eaten steak and kidney pie will probably not be inundated with offers of intimate friendship. Equally, if the word organic makes an inordinate number of appearances in your cupboard, your food's colour scheme is brown, you make marks on your milk carton to ensure that no one nefariously steals any and you do your weekly shopping at the health food store 15 miles away, you will not be the one to whom people flock for a wild night out. Large ethnic rugs and photos of sunsets hanging on your walls may also deter people from entering your room, fearful of being regaled with tales of your humorous/incredible/ life-altering experiences from your gap year. </p> <p>Posters are a separate issue. Every student has a poster in their room, if only to differentiate it from the other identikit hovels in their building. But try to restrain yourself from buying any \"hilarious\" posters: a luridly coloured Bart Simpson, Mona Lisa with a moustache, Einstein sticking his tongue out and \"20 Reasons Why a Beer is Better Than a Woman\" will not create the impression that you are outrageously wacky and fun, and lose their comedic value after, ooh, five seconds on your wall. </p> <p>There are certain possessions that will guarantee an endless stream of visitors: an electric kettle, a pile of magazines and a television. Admittedly, a TV is a high-risk item: I once knew a boy who, after months of pursuit, had finally lured the lovely lady back to his room only to be interrupted mid-seduction by friends determined to watch The Eleven O'Clock Show on their mate's TV. </p> <p>A plentiful supply of biscuits, teabags and alcohol are always welcome, though these may encourage unwanted moochers and spongers taking up residence in your room, as well as hungry rodents. Alongside television sets, many students bring computers, printers, VCRs and, of course, mobile phones, turning their delapidated rooms into glitzy hi-tech caverns. Of all of these, the most useful is probably the phone, as the phone in your hall will always be hogged by that girl down the corridor maintaining a long-term relationship with her boyfriend from home, and no one will ever give you your phone messages anyway. </p> <p>So don't forget to bring extension leads if you want to feed your technological habit, as your room is certain to have only one plug outlet. </p> <p>But let's return to romance: how can you make your room appeal to that desired fellow student who stumbles back to your room with you after the bar has shut? Economy sized boxes of Durex placed \"casually\" on your bookcase will give your room that rather off-putting whiff of virginal desperation. Changing your sheets from time to time will help your lovelife as much as it will improve your sense of personal hygiene. </p> <p>It might be worth your while to have a bit of a tidy-up beforehand. Having a photo of your parents gazing at you sternly from your bedside table will be as off-putting to you as it will be to your intended beloved. </p> <p>Flowers are a cheap way of removing any lingering smells of a late-night kebab munched in bed, and a novel placed on your bedside table can be a good conversation starter, should conversation be needed, eg, \"Absolutely, Martin Amis is so overrated,\" etc. A good rule of thumb for a romance-friendly room can be summed up by the word decent: decent smelling, decent looking, decent time had by all. </p> <p>But no matter how cosy you make your room, there will be those evenings when it's cold, you've run out of food and everyone except you seems to be out. Suddenly, home, with its bountiful supply of heat and comfortable beds, doesn't seem too bad. </p> <p>There are ways of staving off these unexpected pangs of homesickness, besides needlessly swamping your bed with stuffed animals or decorating your wall with blu-tacked photographs of your family. Contrary to those well-worn, if not exactly well-loved student stereotypes, you will occasionally wash your clothes, and using the washing powder mum uses at home provides a comforting scent of home and normality.

      "body": "<p>Good A-level results are a gateway to a new world of learning, but with as many as nine out of 10 graduates leaving university this summer in debt - and many expected to spend the next few years firmly in the red - a university education can be a painful lesson in managing on a tight budget.</p> <p>According to a survey by Barclays Bank, students left university in 1999 with an average of \u00a35,286 of debt, up 18% from the previous year. This year debts are expected to be even higher - even though the full effect of the introduction of tuition fees has yet to feed through. And if the leading vice-chancellors who make up the Russell Group, an elite committee of the 19 top UK universities, have their way, in future students could be facing US-style fees of up to \u00a36,000 a year. This will be in addition to other costs associated with college life, everything from accommodation, food and books to other living expenses. </p> <p>As it is, the National Union of Students estimates that the average student in London, Oxford and Cambridge spends around \u00a37,192 a year on essential items, and \u00a35,581 if at a provincial university. Your first priority will be to pay your tuition fees. Universities will usually stop people graduating if fees are unpaid. However, the maximum tuition-fee contribution expected from students in 2000/2001 is \u00a31,050 and around a third of all students - those whose family income is below \u00a317,805 - will not be required to pay tuition fees. </p> <p>There are also courses, or certain years of some courses, where your college will charge fees of \u00a3520 instead of \u00a31,050. And if you are a student on a full-time or part-time course of initial teacher training (other than a first degree course), you should receive free tuition whatever your and your family's income. In any case, most students are entitled to a grant towards their fees. This grant is based on an assessment by your local education authority of your income and that of your family. </p> <p>Your local authority will want details of your parents' residual income. It does this by taking their gross income, for income-tax purposes, and subtracting certain allowances. Then the local authority decides the parental contribution according to the following calculation: no contribution if their income is less than \u00a317,805; \u00a345 if their residual income is at least \u00a317,805; plus \u00a31 for every \u00a313 of residual income between \u00a317,806 and \u00a322,754; plus \u00a31 for every \u00a39.20 between \u00a322,755 and \u00a333,449; plus \u00a31 for every \u00a37.50 for \u00a333,450 and over. The maximum contribution is \u00a36,437. </p> <p>However, the actual parental contribution cannot be more than the maximum fee contribution of \u00a31,050. Different rules also apply if you have a brother or sister who is also receiving student support from the local authority. Your parents' total contribution will be worked out before it is shared between yourself and your siblings. In normal circumstances, it will be shared out equally. </p> <p>But for all your other expenditure - rent, books, food, going out - you'll need to consider alternative sources of finance, such as a student loan. The maximum amount of loan that you can get depends on where you live and study; which course you study; which year of your course you are on; how much you and your family are expected to contribute, and the length of your academic year. </p> <p>Three-quarters of the maximum loan available does not depend on your or your family's income. For the 2000/ 2001 academic year, all students should qualify for a loan of \u00a32,795 (\u00a33,445 in London) per annum. Some, from less well-off backgrounds, will be eligible for the maximum loan of \u00a33,725 (\u00a34,590 in London). If you're intending to live at home with your parents, you will be eligible for a loan of \u00a32,215 to \u00a32,950, depending on income. You don't have to borrow the full entitlement, but most students do as you cannot apply for a top-up later. The loan can be paid either in three equal instalments or in one lump sum. The latter course is suitable for students with willpower as they can earn interest on the sum advanced until it is needed. If you cannot resist the urge to spend, you should opt to receive an equal portion of your entitlement each term. </p> <p>Tell your parents to dig deep. Calculations from the National Union of Students suggest that even after loans, students will still face a shortfall of more than \u00a33,000 in each undergraduate year. </p> <p>Some parents are better prepared than others. The most prudent will have been setting money aside for five years and more in a Tessa, PEP, ISA or endowment policy. Parents with less than a few months to prepare will have little option but to divert money from funds saved for retirement, or to borrow. </p> <p>Revolving credit or \"draw-down\" loans secured on a home are a cheaper and more flexible form of borrowing than personal loans or overdrafts, allowing parents to draw down cash each term. Parents should also remember that most banks offer preferential rates to students - your parents may have reservations about letting you loose with an interest-free overdraft, but it makes sound financial sense to take advantage of cheap credit where available. </p> <p>Students are also increasingly likely to take part-time jobs, though universities - and the NUS - tend to advise against it. The job market depends on the area, of course, but several sources of student earnings are not taken into consideration by your local authority when calculating grants. Wages from casual or part-time vacation and term-time jobs, the first \u00a3820 of their unearned income, \u00a31,000 of any scholarship and \u00a31,855 of any trust income are all ignored.

They can be used to help with living expenses and course costs including childcare costs, travel, accommodation, household expenses, books and course equipment. You will usually need to wait until you have started your course before you can apply for either a hardship loan or an access funds payment. However, if you think you may need additional financial help to complete your course, you should talk to your college before you start the course, about how these two schemes might be able to help you. </p> <p>Colleges decide which students will receive payments and how much each payment will be.

      "bodyText": "Good A-level results are a gateway to a new world of learning, but with as many as nine out of 10 graduates leaving university this summer in debt - and many expected to spend the next few years firmly in the red - a university education can be a painful lesson in managing on a tight budget. According to a survey by Barclays Bank, students left university in 1999 with an average of \u00a35,286 of debt, up 18% from the previous year. This year debts are expected to be even higher - even though the full effect of the introduction of tuition fees has yet to feed through. And if the leading vice-chancellors who make up the Russell Group, an elite committee of the 19 top UK universities, have their way, in future students could be facing US-style fees of up to \u00a36,000 a year. This will be in addition to other costs associated with college life, everything from accommodation, food and books to other living expenses. As it is, the National Union of Students estimates that the average student in London, Oxford and Cambridge spends around \u00a37,192 a year on essential items, and \u00a35,581 if at a provincial university. Your first priority will be to pay your tuition fees. Universities will usually stop people graduating if fees are unpaid. However, the maximum tuition-fee contribution expected from students in 2000/2001 is \u00a31,050 and around a third of all students - those whose family income is below \u00a317,805 - will not be required to pay tuition fees. There are also courses, or certain years of some courses, where your college will charge fees of \u00a3520 instead of \u00a31,050. And if you are a student on a full-time or part-time course of initial teacher training (other than a first degree course), you should receive free tuition whatever your and your family's income. In any case, most students are entitled to a grant towards their fees. This grant is based on an assessment by your local education authority of your income and that of your family. Your local authority will want details of your parents' residual income. It does this by taking their gross income, for income-tax purposes, and subtracting certain allowances. Then the local authority decides the parental contribution according to the following calculation: no contribution if their income is less than \u00a317,805; \u00a345 if their residual income is at least \u00a317,805; plus \u00a31 for every \u00a313 of residual income between \u00a317,806 and \u00a322,754; plus \u00a31 for every \u00a39.20 between \u00a322,755 and \u00a333,449; plus \u00a31 for every \u00a37.50 for \u00a333,450 and over. The maximum contribution is \u00a36,437. However, the actual parental contribution cannot be more than the maximum fee contribution of \u00a31,050. Different rules also apply if you have a brother or sister who is also receiving student support from the local authority.

In October, almost 400,000 new students will descend on universities across the country, pay their unions an estimated \u00a310m between them for freshers' week events and activities and drink around 6m pints of beer. But is it worth it? Is freshers' week all it's cracked up to be, or is it just a waste of time and money?</p> <p>Kerry McCartney, 20, is in her second year studying history at Birmingham University. \"My freshers' week was definitely worth doing,\" she says. \"It kept me busy for the entire four days. I was never in my room. I was always out meeting people.\" Not everyone has such a good time. Iain MacLeod, 20, is in his first year at Glasgow University. \"I don't like the way people build up freshers' week,\" he says. \"Everyone feels obliged to go to all the events. I got the impression that lots of others weren't having the best time of their lives either. </p> <p>\"I was quite disappointed.\" </p> <p>Arriving at university can be a nerve-wracking experience. The National Union of Students advises freshers to introduce themselves to others on the same corridor in halls and on their course. \"It can be quite overwhelming,\" a spokeswoman says. \"It's not like sixth form, where everyone knows everyone. But remember that everyone is in the same position. It will be a bit weird in the first couple of weeks, but soon you'll start having a fantastic time.\" \"It is quite daunting when you first go,\" admits Kerry. \"You think 'help, will I make friends?' But it's all done for you - you meet people through the freshers' week activities.\"</p> <p>Leon McQuaid, 21, is one of the organisers of this year's freshers' week at Newcastle University. He has been involved in the event each year and has seen thousands of freshers arrive at Newcastle. \"I think quite a lot of people are scared and don't know what to expect,\" he says. \"How do you overcome that? Well, things just happen so quickly in freshers' week. You're thrown into it all and don't have time to worry.\"</p> <p>Most freshers' weeks are based around the student union. Although a week of non-stop alcohol-fuelled excess may appeal to some, it can be physically and emotionally draining - and expensive. \"Freshers' week was quite expensive,\" says Iain. \"We had to pay \u00a330 at the start of the week for a freshers' pack and still had to pay to get into events and parties.\"</p> <p>Add to that the cost of getting yourself equipped with books, everyday expenses such as food and registration fees for clubs and societies and you could find yourself eating into your overdraft sooner than expected. \"Don't be pressurised into attending everything,\" an NUS spokeswoman advises. \"Course and hall events should be a priority. Have a look round and see what's going on before you decide. There are hundreds of societies on offer but you don't need to sign up for everything immediately.\"</p> <p>There are certain clich\u00e9s attached to freshers' week, principally that students reinvent themselves, get drunk and snog. When several thousand hormonal 18-year-olds are thrown together, most away from home for the first time, things can get a bit steamy. \"Everyone is out to get laid,\" says Iain. \"The club nights are big meat markets; everyone thinks they must lose their virginity in the first week.\" With free condoms on offer and huge quantities of alcohol consumed, there are inevitably a few students who make the most of it. </p> <p>For the majority, however, freshers' week is a less passionate affair. \"It wasn't too bad,\" says Kerry. \"I had all these preconceived ideas, but everyone was more relaxed than I expected. There wasn't the emphasis on all of that which I thought there might be.\" In fact, most freshers confine themselves to snogging. It can be tempting to reinvent yourself at university. It is the perfect opportunity to leave your old personality at home - along with your worst clothes and your teddy bear. \"Quite a lot of people try to be something they're not,\" says Iain. \"It can be quite annoying when they aren't being themselves and are trying to be this new, exciting person.\" Although everybody does this to a certain degree, most aren't concerned with being someone they're not. \"Some freshers try to be really cool,\" says Leon. \"They are trying to impress. But arriving at university is such a novelty that most people are much more concerned about having a good time.\"</p> <p>Most freshers' weeks tend to revolve around the social lubricant of drink. \"A lot of alcohol was consumed and that made socialising easier,\" says Kerry. The whole point of freshers' week is, after all, to meet fellow students and make friends. But as Iain points out: \"It's actually quite hard to get to know someone in a club with loud music.\" One of the events at his freshers' week in Glasgow was the Iron Stomach competition: freshers were fed free beer until they threw up. \"The events organised were not great for everyone,\" says Iain. \"There were lots of club nights but not everyone is into that. Events were mostly in the evening, so the days were quite long.\"</p> <p>Freshers' week should, in fact, be for everyone. Leon has gone to great lengths to arrange activities so that everyone can get involved. \"We don't want people to be left out or miss out on things,\" he says.</p> <p>\"We'll have day events like DJ workshops, go-karting and brewery trips and then clubs and bands and hypnotists in the evenings.\"</p> <p>With thousands of other first years in the same position, everybody makes friends sooner or later. Despite the old warning about people you meet in freshers' week (that you spend the rest of the term trying to avoid them) many people make friends for life. Kerry now lives with the friends she made in her first week at university. </p> <p>\"Memory loss, debt, hangover and 'boyfriend' all told, I enjoyed freshers' week so much I went back the next year as a steward. Whether you experience the best days of your life, are sorely disappointed, or something in between, there is no other introduction to university life like it.\"</p>",

Where will I live?</p> <p>For first-year students the last question shouldn't arise. Most universities have dedicated accommodation reserved for their first-year intake - either in halls of residence or university-owned housing. But some students could find themselves looking for rented accommodation in their first year, and most will spend at least one year in a bedsit or flat.

The argument now raging between Woodhead and the universities echoes an all-too-familiar quarrel between anxious parents and their headstrong children. </p> <p>\"We need to be certain,\" Woodhead wrote in the Sunday Times this week, \"that undergraduate study is in the interests of the individuals applying to universities\". Like Woodhead, many parents believe they are arguing on behalf of a child's best interest when they insist that a good course is one which leads to a good job. At home and outside, there is a clash of ideas as to why higher education is valuable: is it because of what young people gain after they've graduated, or because of what they experience while they're studying? </p> <p>A-level students who discover this week that they have not done well enough to gain a place on their preferred course will again confront this question. Many will have to re-think their university and their course. Some will find that the more traditional courses are, this year, closed to them. They will have to decide whether to opt for a less mainstream course, or postpone education for a year. While at least one of the degree courses now available is likely to be of some intrinsic interest, they will also be asked whether such a course is \"worthwhile\". </p> <p>Feeling vulnerable, disappointed and uncertain of their future, they may seek a parent's help. All too often, a parent may cling to the mindset that education is only useful in so far as it produces specific, employable skills (and now they have the Chief Inspector to back them up). The young person balks at such intellectual prudery, and before you know it parent and child are locked in a frustrating, debilitating argument. The terms of the argument seem clear: employment prospects versus educational excitement; sense versus sensibility; substance versus vacuousness. </p> <p>But the apparent clarity is deceptive, and clouds our ability to make (or to guide) decisions, whether the debate is conducted on a personal level, or on the more public one which challenges the purpose of wide-ranging university courses. The confusions in the debate confound young people's confidence in making decisions, and the conflict with a parent deprives them of much-needed support. </p> <p>One problem is that parents and even teachers often look to young people's future with an outmoded model of education leading to a career. Now a degree is just one of many qualifications an employer will consider. Even graduates from the best universities, taking the most traditional courses, have to stand up to stiff competition and adapt their plans to what's available. Instead of complaining that some courses do not prepare young people for specific careers, we should be demanding that no course be too rigidly linked to any single career. </p> <p>In all probability, today's teenagers will, at 30, be in a very different career from the one they start in their early twenties. They may be in jobs we cannot yet name. We do know, however, that tomorrow's adults will need to be flexible. Even if we insist on debating the value of education in terms of employment prospects, we still need a broad scope. Employers value people who are imaginative and creative and who are undaunted by problems. They are after a lively mind, rather than a body of knowledge. If a young person is considering one of those derided courses - in golf course management, knitwear, beauty therapy or media studies - we cannot predict where it will or won't lead. A BSc in Business Perfumery may get a laugh, but several professors at Stanford University in California are now in the business of identifying and modifying smells for commercial use. </p> <p>The relevant question is not what specialist skills a course provides, but what understanding it fosters. A course is \"vacuous\" not if it does not lead to a job in a particular field, but if it does not provide intellectual stimulation. </p> <p>Encouraging young people to study courses that are intrinsically interesting to them will not make the task of choosing intrinsically easy, but it will help. Young people should ask themselves what they like and dislike about what they are studying now. They could consider what they admire about the lives of people they know and visualise their futures. These reflections will highlight interests and preferences that can then be linked to present choices and subsequent possibilities. Envisaging a variety of outcomes will ease the anxiety many young people experience when making what seems like a momentous and final choice. </p> <p>Parents, meanwhile, should also ask themselves how genuinely open they are to what a daughter or son wants to do. A familiar gripe from young people is that what their parent calls a \"discussion\" feels like a \"lecture\". </p> <p>Young people can be encouraged to identify what they can't control (disappointing exam results, for example), and what they can (the immediate next step). They can remind themselves that they have the power to change some things in their lives, and that they will keep this power even after they have made important choices. One of Woodhead's imperatives for developing the higher education system we need is to engage different generations in a conversation in which young people learn to find meaning in the things that have greatly moved humankind. I would agree with this if the term \"conversation\" held onto its meaning as a two-way exchange, whereby each generation had a voice. In that case, courses would continue to proliferate in response to a new generation's experiences and interests. The workforce Britain needs would be recognised as having a human dimension, which education would serve by fostering the curiosity and quirkiness that intellectually healthy people have. As young people make dizzying decisions about courses and careers, they, too, have to be certain that their study is in the interests of the individual. </p> <p>Terri Apter is a senior tutor at Clare Hall, Cambridge.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Today's the day thousands of young people, and their friends and families, have been dreading for some time - it's A-level results day. </p> <p>The trip to your school or college to collect the slips of paper with the good news, the bad news or the somewhere-in-between news is likely to be a tense one, and the wait once you get there is almost unbearable. But what do you do when the grades are staring you in the face? How best to react? First, the lucky ones - you've got the results you need, so it's time to celebrate. No need to do anything immediately - your chosen university will soon be in touch to add to your feeling of personal wellbeing.</p> <p>What happens if your results are not exactly as desired? Even if you have not scored the points or got the grades your university wanted, they may well still accept you - telephone to find out. Universities would often rather accept those whose applications they received and considered in the first round of application than those applying at the last minute in clearing. </p> <p>Pupils in Scotland who have not yet received their Highers results would not be disadvantaged in the clearing scramble, ministers have assured the public, while universities are telling people not to panic. Results are promised by tomorrow, but in the meantime try to speak to directly to the admissions tutor on your course to clarify the situation. </p> <p>But if you are at all doubtful about your results there is no harm in ringing other universities about potential alternatives - students in England and Wales will be hitting the phones today - always bearing in mind that if you do get the grades you will have to stick to your existing offer. </p> <p>This year applicants who have access to the internet can register with Ucas, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, this morning to see online whether or not their first-choice institution has confirmed their place. </p> <p>If your results are not what you'd hoped for, this is where clearing comes into play. It is worth getting to grips with how it works and how you can get the best from it. Put simply, clearing involves all those universities who still have places on some of their courses and all those students who are without places and who are still searching for one. </p> <p>You are eligible for clearing if you did not receive offers when you first applied through the Ucas system or if you did not get the grades for the two offers you were holding over the summer. Any last-minute applicant will also be trying for a place through the clearing process, which starts now and continues until late September. Not all universities and colleges, and not all courses, will be in clearing; so some research is necessary. These pages include details, including information on teletext and the internet. However, information is often nothing without advice, so talk to your teacher or adviser on your best line of attack before committing yourself.</p> <p>The best piece of advice at this stage is to act swiftly but not in haste; and don't panic. Much of the action in clearing does take place in the first few days, so be prepared to move. There are likely to be plenty of good opportunities for you as long as you passed at least one A-level or successfully completed your GNVQ, so: </p> <p>\u0095 act quickly</p> <p>\u0095 get information about what's on offer</p> <p>\u0095 phone to check that places are still available and what grades are required</p> <p>\u0095 if offered a place, express positive interest </p> <p>\u0095 do not commit yourself if you need to take stock - ask for some time </p> <p>\u0095 even if you are thinking of resits, do look at vacancies in clearing </p> <p>\u0095 don't give up if nothing comes up at first - keep trying</p> <p>Everyone in clearing is issued a clearing form and number by Ucas. It is only when you have given the number and your form to a university that your place is guaranteed.

      "bodyText": "Today's the day thousands of young people, and their friends and families, have been dreading for some time - it's A-level results day. The trip to your school or college to collect the slips of paper with the good news, the bad news or the somewhere-in-between news is likely to be a tense one, and the wait once you get there is almost unbearable. But what do you do when the grades are staring you in the face? How best to react? First, the lucky ones - you've got the results you need, so it's time to celebrate. No need to do anything immediately - your chosen university will soon be in touch to add to your feeling of personal wellbeing. What happens if your results are not exactly as desired? Even if you have not scored the points or got the grades your university wanted, they may well still accept you - telephone to find out. Universities would often rather accept those whose applications they received and considered in the first round of application than those applying at the last minute in clearing. Pupils in Scotland who have not yet received their Highers results would not be disadvantaged in the clearing scramble, ministers have assured the public, while universities are telling people not to panic. Results are promised by tomorrow, but in the meantime try to speak to directly to the admissions tutor on your course to clarify the situation. But if you are at all doubtful about your results there is no harm in ringing other universities about potential alternatives - students in England and Wales will be hitting the phones today - always bearing in mind that if you do get the grades you will have to stick to your existing offer. This year applicants who have access to the internet can register with Ucas, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, this morning to see online whether or not their first-choice institution has confirmed their place. If your results are not what you'd hoped for, this is where clearing comes into play. It is worth getting to grips with how it works and how you can get the best from it. Put simply, clearing involves all those universities who still have places on some of their courses and all those students who are without places and who are still searching for one. You are eligible for clearing if you did not receive offers when you first applied through the Ucas system or if you did not get the grades for the two offers you were holding over the summer. Any last-minute applicant will also be trying for a place through the clearing process, which starts now and continues until late September. Not all universities and colleges, and not all courses, will be in clearing; so some research is necessary. These pages include details, including information on teletext and the internet. However, information is often nothing without advice, so talk to your teacher or adviser on your best line of attack before committing yourself. The best piece of advice at this stage is to act swiftly but not in haste; and don't panic. Much of the action in clearing does take place in the first few days, so be prepared to move. There are likely to be plenty of good opportunities for you as long as you passed at least one A-level or successfully completed your GNVQ, so: \u0095 act quickly \u0095 get information about what's on offer \u0095 phone to check that places are still available and what grades are required \u0095 if offered a place, express positive interest \u0095 do not commit yourself if you need to take stock - ask for some time \u0095 even if you are thinking of resits, do look at vacancies in clearing \u0095 don't give up if nothing comes up at first - keep trying Everyone in clearing is issued a clearing form and number by Ucas. It is only when you have given the number and your form to a university that your place is guaranteed. You cannot negotiate with other institutions after this point, so arrive at your decision carefully and take expert advice if in any doubt. Visit the university if you can - check out the course, accommodation and general feel of the location: after all, you'll be spending the next three or four years of your life there. It is a good idea to try to think imaginatively during clearing. It can be up to 11 months since you first applied, and ideas understandably change in that time - you can look at subject areas that are different from your original choice, or consider joint or modular degrees where you will be studying two or more subjects. Whatever you consider, always research these new options fully, so you know what's involved. Beware universities who offer you something completely different from your chosen course. Town planning is a far cry from English, for example. If you didn't plan to go to university before, but are suddenly getting interested, now is the time to take action. There is no reason why you should not enter the fray along with everyone else, so start phoning! You will need to contact Ucas to get a form and a clearing number. Last year more than 60,000 people found places through clearing, so get active, be flexible, be persistent and take advice whenever in doubt. In less than two months you could be happily embarking on a higher education course. John Beckett is a higher education adviser. Ucas: www.ucas.ac.uk Telephone: 01242 227788.",

One possibility is a \"superdisk\" such as the Iomega Jaz drive or the similar Orb system. </p> <p>These can store 2GB per disk, but the disks are expensive. (Iomega's popular Zip disks, which hold 100MB or 250MB, are now too small for back-ups, and the disks are also too expensive.) CD writers are more attractive because they double up as CD players and let you create your own audio CDs. </p> <p>They are cheap to run: blank CD-R discs cost less than \u00a31, and rewriteable CDRW discs cost less than \u00a32 each. The problem is that one disc does not hold enough: typically 74 minutes of audio or 650MB of data. You would need 16 discs, and a lot of spare time, to back up a 10GB hard drive. </p> <p>DVD-ram drives can store 2.6GB on a single-sided disc costing about \u00a315. When the cost of drives comes down to \u00a3200 or less, and blank disc prices are also halved, they could be almost irresistible. </p> <p><strong> Why not MD? </strong><br> Is there any reason why it shouldn't be possible to back up PC files onto a recordable MiniDisc player and, if not, why doesn't this facility seem to be available? <strong>John Arran</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:john.arran@eds.com\">john.arran@eds.com</a> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> MiniDiscs were designed to store audio data using a \"lossy\" compression system that Sony calls ATRAC (Adaptive TRansform Acoustic Coding). </p> <p>Unfortunately, \"lossy\" compression systems, which throw away data they think you can't see or hear, are no use for computer data where every bit counts. </p> <p>In 1993, however, Sony announced a suitable format called MD Data, and Sony and Sharp said they would have 650MB drives ready by 1997. This is only 4.6 times the capacity of a standard MiniDisc, so I expect Sony could have done it. </p> <p>But presumably they could not do it at a price competitive with CD-based systems. </p> <p><strong> Why not CD? </strong><br> I back up data files to floppy disk. I understand I can use a CD-R or CD-RW (rewriteable) drive, but CD files are \"Read-only\", and when copied back to the hard drive cannot be edited.

Alas no. In fact the thought of the Channel 4 bad boy becoming PM would be easier for the British public to come to terms with than the news I was about to hear. I listened, but my brain struggled to understand what was coming in through my ears. It didn't make sense. What I thought I heard was that John Kettley, weatherman and the UK's premier jumper and beard wearer, is thinking of hanging up his Wellington boots after 20 years. Would I write a word or two about John?</p> <p>A number of things crossed my mind. It's a mistake. A joke. I've misheard. It's a downright lie. A publicity stunt by John's press officer, (John himself would never sink so low). But my grief reaction was short-lived as the realisation dawned that this was no joke. I had heard correctly. John Kettley, bastion of British weather broadcasting, is to walk off into the sunset as the credits role at the end of his meteorological movie.</p> <p>So why have I been asked to express the grief of the nation? Who am I to lament the passing of an era which has seen the likes of Fish, McCaskill and Giles provide a solid, reliable service for more than 15 years?</p> <p>Rewind to the summer of 1988. Fish was still recovering from the public backlash after the 1987 hurricane. Wincey Willis had yet to make her full impact and no one knew who Ulrika Jonsson was. The way was clear for a star, a hero, a Kettley. It had to be done and so I set to with my band A Tribe of Toffs. We wrote a song cunningly titled John Kettley (Is a Weatherman). The chorus went something like this: \"John Kettley is a weatherman, a weatherman, a weatherman, John Kettley is a weatherman, and so is Michael Fish.\"</p> <p>Inspired, I'm sure you'll agree. The Toffs were Andy Stephenson, Phil Rogers, Motch Bondouche (stage name) and myself. We formed in 1986 and recorded hour upon hour of mind-numbingly stupid songs in my tiny bedroom studio in Sunderland. There are still two CDs of that stuff for sale on our website (<a href=\"http://www.monocle.org/toffs\" target=\"_NEW\">www.monocle.org/toffs</a>) if you're interested. John Kettley (Is a Weatherman) was just one of the many odd little tunes.</p> <p>Anyway, in a moment of madness I sent a cassette of that song and others to Children's BBC. Just when I had completely forgotten about it, a call came from BBC producer Paul Smith asking if we would like to come down to London to record John Kettley at Maid Avale studios. I was 18 and this was the most exciting thing I had ever done and was ever likely to do. We made a video and actually met the great man himself. The idea was that we would jump through the weather map while John was in full flow and kidnap him. He was thrown to the floor and covered in masking tape and never complained once. Not only did we get to go to the BBC, make a video and meet John Kettley, but we stayed at the Kensington Hilton for free!</p> <p>From the initial airing on But First This, which was the kids summer TV show of the time, it took until October to get a record deal, and the song was finally released in early December. For some reason which I have never understood, Radio 1 put the song on its playlist and it was played nonstop for about six weeks. We appeared live on the Wogan show and the song peaked on the Christmas chart of 1988 at number 21. Twelve years later it is still one of the best experiences of my life. The success of A Tribe of Toffs was shortlived. We tried to capitalise by releasing Oh No, Terry Wogan's on TV (Again). Bad idea? Yes, you're probably right.</p> <p>What happened to the four lads who shook the world with the Kettley song? I don't know what happened to Phil. Motch is an IT consultant. Andy is the charge nurse in a child and adolescent psychiatric unit in Hull. I juggle being a psychiatric nurse and playing in another band called Ruth (<a href=\"http://www.ruth.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.ruth.co.uk</a>) one single at number 65 in the charts and a couple of national lottery TV performances to our credit). Interesting how two of us are now in the mental health profession. Did the Kettley song have such an effect on us? It can certainly come back and haunt you from time to time. Especially when one is trying to forge a serious music career. It often does not help that your biggest success is a novelty song.</p> <p>So what is it that has led John to call it a day? Has he lost his warm front? Have there been one too many depressions of late? It certainly seems like things have been getting chilly in the BBC weather centre over the past few years. Recently Bill Giles was cleared of allegations that he had bullied and intimidated TV colleagues. Michael Fish has been criticised for taking the weather too seriously. But this has not unsettled the old school as much as the influx of young attractive women in to the fold. Of course we're used to the dippy blonde Ulrika Johnson stereotype, but this is far more sinister. These women are much more of a threat to John and his contemporaries. Not only do they make the TV screen look good but they know their stuff.</p> <p>Problem is, it's like walking into a new fully-furnished house. It looks great and provides everything you might need. But it doesn't feel like home. Where's the emotional bond? I need to feel connected to my weather presenter. Read these names to yourself: Vicky Graham, Carol Kirkwood, Louise Lear, Helen Willets. All BBC weather presenters. Can you put a face to any of them? Do you feel connected? Do you feel touched the way John touched us all? No. And will they be there for us in 10 years time? Will they survive the avalanche of public criticism following the next hurricane? Will they even feel accountable or responsible for their broadcasts? I doubt it. Not like John. Maybe that's it. Maybe John has finally cracked. Talk about being in a high pressure job. Pun intended.</p> <p>There are other reasons why the cuddly bearded one feels he's being edged out of the market. What with analogue satellite, digital satellite, digital terrestrial, cable, digital radio, Teletext, the internet and Wap phones, we have so many places to get our weather info from. Maybe we don't need John anymore. Who needs to wait until after the news when we can just turn to the Weather Channel 24 hours a day?</p> <p>There was a time when the BBC was a friend with whom you shared many adventures. Now we don't have any friends, just numerous work colleagues. We choose who we need to see to get what we want and then leave. There's no time to form a relationship. The Beeb has no alternative. It's been proven over and over that sex sells and that's what the corporation is doing. It's sad but a beautiful female weather presenter has more of it than John Kettley. Sex appeal that is.</p> <p>For those of us who love John and everything he stands for, it's tempting to panic. Get on a train to London, swamp the BBC with calls, set up a 24-hour vigil in John's home town of Halifax. Beg him to reconsider and fight the onslaught. Write to your MP. Surely there's some act of parliament to prevent disasters like this? But maybe we should hold back the tears and understand that life goes on. Let's not be angry. Remember the happy times: 9.32, 6.30 and 1.25 before Neighbours. Remember the beard, the smile, the accent and the jumpers. Above all remember this, John Kettley is a weatherman, a weatherman, a weatherman.</p>",

We appeared live on the Wogan show and the song peaked on the Christmas chart of 1988 at number 21. Twelve years later it is still one of the best experiences of my life. The success of A Tribe of Toffs was shortlived. We tried to capitalise by releasing Oh No, Terry Wogan's on TV (Again). Bad idea? Yes, you're probably right. What happened to the four lads who shook the world with the Kettley song? I don't know what happened to Phil. Motch is an IT consultant. Andy is the charge nurse in a child and adolescent psychiatric unit in Hull. I juggle being a psychiatric nurse and playing in another band called Ruth (www.ruth.co.uk) one single at number 65 in the charts and a couple of national lottery TV performances to our credit). Interesting how two of us are now in the mental health profession. Did the Kettley song have such an effect on us? It can certainly come back and haunt you from time to time. Especially when one is trying to forge a serious music career. It often does not help that your biggest success is a novelty song. So what is it that has led John to call it a day? Has he lost his warm front? Have there been one too many depressions of late? It certainly seems like things have been getting chilly in the BBC weather centre over the past few years. Recently Bill Giles was cleared of allegations that he had bullied and intimidated TV colleagues. Michael Fish has been criticised for taking the weather too seriously. But this has not unsettled the old school as much as the influx of young attractive women in to the fold. Of course we're used to the dippy blonde Ulrika Johnson stereotype, but this is far more sinister. These women are much more of a threat to John and his contemporaries. Not only do they make the TV screen look good but they know their stuff. Problem is, it's like walking into a new fully-furnished house. It looks great and provides everything you might need. But it doesn't feel like home. Where's the emotional bond? I need to feel connected to my weather presenter. Read these names to yourself: Vicky Graham, Carol Kirkwood, Louise Lear, Helen Willets. All BBC weather presenters. Can you put a face to any of them? Do you feel connected? Do you feel touched the way John touched us all? No. And will they be there for us in 10 years time? Will they survive the avalanche of public criticism following the next hurricane? Will they even feel accountable or responsible for their broadcasts? I doubt it. Not like John. Maybe that's it. Maybe John has finally cracked. Talk about being in a high pressure job. Pun intended. There are other reasons why the cuddly bearded one feels he's being edged out of the market. What with analogue satellite, digital satellite, digital terrestrial, cable, digital radio, Teletext, the internet and Wap phones, we have so many places to get our weather info from. Maybe we don't need John anymore. Who needs to wait until after the news when we can just turn to the Weather Channel 24 hours a day? There was a time when the BBC was a friend with whom you shared many adventures. Now we don't have any friends, just numerous work colleagues. We choose who we need to see to get what we want and then leave. There's no time to form a relationship. The Beeb has no alternative. It's been proven over and over that sex sells and that's what the corporation is doing. It's sad but a beautiful female weather presenter has more of it than John Kettley. Sex appeal that is. For those of us who love John and everything he stands for, it's tempting to panic. Get on a train to London, swamp the BBC with calls, set up a 24-hour vigil in John's home town of Halifax. Beg him to reconsider and fight the onslaught. Write to your MP. Surely there's some act of parliament to prevent disasters like this? But maybe we should hold back the tears and understand that life goes on. Let's not be angry. Remember the happy times: 9.32, 6.30 and 1.25 before Neighbours. Remember the beard, the smile, the accent and the jumpers. Above all remember this, John Kettley is a weatherman, a weatherman, a weatherman.",

      "bodyText": "Nineteen years a navy wife, stoically inured to the hardships of life in the Russian far north, Galina Belogunya came close to breaking point yesterday as she endured the endless wait to learn if her officer husband, Viktor, was alive. A captain and engineer on board the stricken Kursk submarine at the bottom of the Arctic, Viktor would be able to cope, his wife was sure. \"He knows everything, he can do anything. He won't lose it. He'll do everything possible. I just know it.\" Along with other relatives of crew members - Moscow yesterday raised the number on board to 118 from 116 - Mrs Belogunya waited for the fifth day at the submarine's base of Vidyayeva in a northern Russian fjord and vented her frustration on the navy superiors she said could not give a fig for the lives of the seamen. \"For days the bosses in Moscow have been fighting to save their ship,\" said Mrs Belogunya bitterly. \"They'd rather save their valuable material than human lives.

The trapped seamen passed the 100-hour mark on the Arctic seabed yesterday. Viktor Kuznetsov, a warrant officer on the submarine since it was launched six years ago, is from the southern town of Kursk after which the vessel was named. His mother Olga has spent the past two days weeping and praying before the Orthodox icon that customarily takes up a corner of a Russian living room. \"Last night the icon fell from the wall,\" she said. \"It's an omen.

They know nothing and we know nothing.\" Friends clubbed together to buy her a ticket to Murmansk and she is to fly there today. The anger and frustration spell trouble for President Vladimir Putin. For the first time in the five-day crisis in the far north, the political backlash set in yesterday. While Mrs Belogunya waited in the Arctic, Mr Putin and the Kremlin elite were 1,800 miles away at the other end of the country in Russia's sunshine belt on the Black Sea. The influential Moscow newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta went on the attack against Mr Putin, drawing parallels be tween the Kursk crisis and the Chernobyl disaster of 1996, suggesting that Mr Putin's early promise could fade as did Mikhail Gorbachev's in the years that followed the Chernobyl explosion. \"The commander-in-chief,\" said the paper on its front page, should give \"a clear and unequivocal order to the generals and admirals to save the people on the Kursk at any price, even at the price of the ireversible loss of the boat. If the crew is not saved, the tragic accident on the nuclear submarine could be critical to public opinion in Russia and across the world.

Unfortunately, it's devilishly bad luck, the weather's very bad.\" Mrs Belogunya's indictment of the authorities' slow response to the emergency and the lack of glasnost in dealing with the relatives was echoed by other relatives, many of whom have been confined to a navy hospital ship, the Svir, in the northern port of Severomorsk and are being shielded from the media. Far from the Arctic drama, in the southern town of Kursk distraught relatives of crew members wept, prayed, and scrambled for information about their loved ones. Anna Kubikova was at her wits' end trying and failing to get information on whether her son was on board. \"These are all our children and we're very afraid,\" she said. \"I asked the town recruiting office whether my son was on the boat or on shore. I didn't get an answer.\" \"The entire town is in a state of shock,\" said Aleksei Smirnin of the local television station in Kursk. Russian submarines are customarily named after Russian towns and close bonds develop between the town and the crew. Seven conscripts from Kursk aged between 17 and 20 joined the crew last autumn.

Mr Smirnin spoke to her yesterday. \"You can imagine what kind of state she's in,\" he said. Yuriy Yevdokimov, governor of Murmansk region, said dealing with the relatives was \"the most dangerous and most difficult thing for us right now\". In Kursk, local activists are organising social workers and psychologists to treat the families of the men in the sunken submarine. It was only yesterday that the authorities established a helpline for the relatives and the tardiness of such responses as well as the rescue effort and the delays in seeking western assistance is drawing much hostile comment in the Moscow media, on radio phone-ins, in opinion polls, and from experts. \"They told us that the crew evacuation attempt began yesterday,\" said Mrs Belogunya. \"What were they doing before that?\" The chief designer of the Russian rescue craft being used yesterday said the mini-submarines had been idle for years. \"The lack of training could have a big impact,\" said Anatoliy Ivanzhin. \"We asked for money to build new ones two years ago but we didn't get it.\" The daily newspaper Segodnya painted a picture of careerist cowardice and bungling at navy headquarters in Moscow. It said that the deputy prime minister, Ilya Klebanov, had ruled out accepting offers of foreign help on Tuesday \"right when it was clear that the crisis was becoming a catastrophe\". \"It's no secret that the Russian military likes to pretend that everything is OK,\" said Vladimir Lukin, a deputy speaker of parliament.

      "body": "<p>It was the rough equivalent of printing the obituary as soon as the patient was admitted to hospital. Scarcely had British Airways announced that it was grounding its Concorde fleet than the scribblers and assorted experts were predicting that the exotic bird would never fly again. It wasn't long before the \"I told you so\" brigade was in full song, pointing out that it had been a silly idea from the start - a commercial failure, a dubious display of propagandist technology and plain hubris.</p> <p>The predictions of Concorde's demise had little to do with the specific nature of the technical flaws discovered by French crash investigators - after all, fixing a wheel can't be rocket science. Instead it had everything to do with the aircraft's apparently fatal loss of a crucial and often elusive commodity: public confidence. Put simply, however thoroughly Concorde is patched up, however many guarantees of its safety are issued, it seems unlikely that anyone will feel confident enough to fly in it. Or at least that enough people will to make it economically viable.</p> <p>But if history is any judge, reports of Concorde's death could be, to misquote Mark Twain, greatly exaggerated. Accidents and disasters happen. A bridge collapses, a fire breaks out in a tunnel, some foodstuff - eggs, beef - is found to make us ill, a new car with a high centre of gravity topples over at high speed, a medical drug causes an unforeseen outbreak of some nameless dread, and yet we go on to cross and recross bridges, drive through tunnels, boil eggs, roast beef, change lanes erratically on wind-lashed motorways at 100mph and swallow pills of uncertain provenance and dubious effect.</p> <p>It took three fatal crashes between May 1953 and April 1954 for BOAC to withdraw its depleted fleet of Comet airliners. The De Havilland Comet was the world's first jet airliner, a winged wonder to those who witnessed its first fare-paying flight on May 2 1952 from Heathrow to Johannesburg just as much as Concorde was when it took commercial wing some 24 years later. Unfortunately it also suffered metal fatigue: the fuselage expanded as the futuristic 500mph aircraft climbed into the stratosphere, cracks appeared and it fell apart.</p> <p>Yet four years later, the Comet 4, a similar aircraft, took to the air on the London to New York run. Passengers appeared to have had no fear of this stretched Comet, but what it had lost on the way to production was the confidence of airlines. Only 74 were sold worldwide: De Havilland had expected orders of up to 1,000. Just as well perhaps as, in all, 20 Comets crashed, killing nearly 500 people. The British jet was killed off in any case by the all-conquering Boeing 707, which set out from New York to London just a month after the Comet 4. Knowing the Comet's reputation, one of the first flights I paid for with my own money was on board a bucket-shop Dan Air Comet 4B at the tail end of its working life. We put accidents and disasters behind us, otherwise we would never fly, cross a bridge or dive into a tunnel.</p> <p>\"In terms of Concorde,\" says Dr Peter Marsh, psychologist and co-director of the Social Issues Research Centre, \"it comes down to the public's perception of risk. A plane crash is obviously seen as a disaster, but people are very aware that planes in general are a safe way of travelling [the risk of your plane crashing this year is approximately a million to one]. Even people who have a fear of flying are prepared to get on planes after crashes. The same applied to Concorde after the Paris crash. In fact, I think people will become very nostalgic if Concorde is grounded for ever; this is quite rational behaviour because people can work out the extent of their individual risk. Concorde is very unlikely to cause their death.\"</p> <p>The fire that broke out in 1996 has not discouraged millions of motorists, lorry drivers and Eurostar passengers (19 million last year) from travelling through the Channel tunnel; it is by far the most convenient link for most people between England and France. Passenger numbers were back up to pre-fire levels just a few weeks later.</p> <p>Similarly, many will remember the Herald of Free Enterprise, the roll-on, roll-off ferry that set sail from Zeebrugge in 1987, bow doors resolutely open. The car decks filled with water and it sank three quarters of a mile outside the harbour. Seven years later the bow doors were ripped off the Estonia as it sailed off the Finnish coast in a storm: 834 people died. It shouldn't have been on the high sea in a storm, just as there had been no excuse for the Herald of Free Enterprise to set sail with its bow doors open. Yet these incidents are rare and have not stopped many millions of people from sailing with their cars and loved ones across waters that can be every bit as treacherous.</p> <p>\"What these accidents do tend to encourage,\" says Neil Brown, of the Science Museum in London, \"is greater care and safety in the future. The reason the Forth Railway bridge was so hugely over-engineered was, in part, a response to the spectacular collapse of the Tay bridge a few years earlier. The Tay bridge was the longest in the world at the time of its construction in 1878; its loss [along with a locomotive, six carriages and 75 lives], was a blow to national prestige. This was the single greatest structural failure in these islands. It couldn't happen again.\"</p> <p>It didn't. Today's great bridges are nearly all held up by suspension cables. Forth, Severn and Humber road bridges all sway in the wind, yet we trust them not to give way to gravity as the Tacoma Narrows bridge, in Washington state, did in 1940. \"Gallopin' Gertie\", just 19 months old and so named because of her sick-making vertical oscillations, got herself into a mother of a twist that November. Twisting and shaking for 45 minutes, one sidewalk rose 28ft above the other before the cables snapped and Gertie gave up the ghost. A freak occurrence we say, and put it down to that.</p> <p>Entire technologies can be almost completely obliterated by major accidents - recall the fires that destroyed the R101 and Hindenburg airships in the 1930s - but in most cases, the spirit of opti mism triumphs over the dark angel of experience. In 1990 traces of benzene were found in Perrier at the height of the water's success in restaurants worldwide. One hundred and sixty million green bottles were recalled from the shelves of bistros, hotels and grocery stores. An investigation kept the sparkling water off the market for several months. This should have been time enough for Perrier's rivals, such as Evian and San Pellegrino, to sparkle. But no one had become ill and no one had died. \"Helleau,\" said the posters that June. The benzene incident has been forgotten.</p> <p>\"Perrier,\" says Peter Marsh, \"was a temporary accident. With effective PR it was easy to get public confidence back. But when people start believing that a certain food is truly toxic then you'll find an almost religious fervour against it. Evidence for the product will be misread. Unreason rules the roost.\" As, of course, it did in 1989 when a salmonella scare - real enough, but overegged - scrambled British brains. In our millions we took against the humble egg and with it Edwina Currie, a junior agriculture minister, who was duly sacrificed. A few years later came BSE and the unedifying sight of John Gummer, John Major's secretary of state for the environment, force-feeding his unfortunate daughter with a burger to prove to the press that she would not suffer from eating British beef.</p> <p>\"We've seen people becoming increasingly fearful of food because of BSE and GM scares\", says Marsh. \"Today there are influential organisations virtually dedicated to driving these fears.\"</p> <p>Much the same applies to the continuing debate over the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine. This began in 1996 when an article in the British Medical Journal linked it to autism. It caused a national scare among parents that has yet to abate. \"The article was based on a study of just 25 children,\" a department of health spokesperson wearily points out. \"No causal link was established between autism and the vaccine. Every single bit of research that has been done on the topic since then has shown results to the contrary of the original study, but people still go on about it and parents are still worried.\" Our reaction to technologies that we believe to have failed or to be dangerous is undoubtedly confused. Concorde lets us down fatally for the first time in almost 25 years and it is promptly consigned to the scrapyard of history. And yet we may well rue its passing. Scares come and go. Has the Channel tunnel led to a plague of foreign rats and rabies in Little Britain? No. Has John Gummer's unfortunate daughter succumbed to BSE? No. Was anyone in a power suit poisoned by a bottle of Perrier? Again, no.</p> <p>Not long ago I got to drive a Chevrolet Corvair. (This was the car that made Ralph Nader's name as a champion of consumer rights in the 60s. Nader's book Unsafe at Any Speed did an effective j'accuse job on the rear-engined American sedan.)</p> <p>\"You're not going to drive one really, are you?\" asked an American friend. \"You're crazy. You'll kill yourself.\" I didn't because the car I drove was a '68 model; its rear suspension, the source of the car's troubles between 1960 and 1963, had been well and truly sorted out. The car drove safely, just as transatlantic liners sailed more safely after the sinking of the Titanic, as railway bridges were made safer after the Tay Bridge disaster, as suspension bridges were after the Tacoma Narrows incident.</p> <p>Sometimes our faith in progress is dented, but although you might not want to travel on one, airships are still blimping through the air 63 years on from the Hindenburg fire. And Concorde - the magnificent flying machine that fell to earth - might yet defy the obituarists.</p>",

Knowing the Comet's reputation, one of the first flights I paid for with my own money was on board a bucket-shop Dan Air Comet 4B at the tail end of its working life. We put accidents and disasters behind us, otherwise we would never fly, cross a bridge or dive into a tunnel. \"In terms of Concorde,\" says Dr Peter Marsh, psychologist and co-director of the Social Issues Research Centre, \"it comes down to the public's perception of risk. A plane crash is obviously seen as a disaster, but people are very aware that planes in general are a safe way of travelling [the risk of your plane crashing this year is approximately a million to one]. Even people who have a fear of flying are prepared to get on planes after crashes. The same applied to Concorde after the Paris crash. In fact, I think people will become very nostalgic if Concorde is grounded for ever; this is quite rational behaviour because people can work out the extent of their individual risk. Concorde is very unlikely to cause their death.\" The fire that broke out in 1996 has not discouraged millions of motorists, lorry drivers and Eurostar passengers (19 million last year) from travelling through the Channel tunnel; it is by far the most convenient link for most people between England and France. Passenger numbers were back up to pre-fire levels just a few weeks later. Similarly, many will remember the Herald of Free Enterprise, the roll-on, roll-off ferry that set sail from Zeebrugge in 1987, bow doors resolutely open. The car decks filled with water and it sank three quarters of a mile outside the harbour. Seven years later the bow doors were ripped off the Estonia as it sailed off the Finnish coast in a storm: 834 people died. It shouldn't have been on the high sea in a storm, just as there had been no excuse for the Herald of Free Enterprise to set sail with its bow doors open. Yet these incidents are rare and have not stopped many millions of people from sailing with their cars and loved ones across waters that can be every bit as treacherous. \"What these accidents do tend to encourage,\" says Neil Brown, of the Science Museum in London, \"is greater care and safety in the future. The reason the Forth Railway bridge was so hugely over-engineered was, in part, a response to the spectacular collapse of the Tay bridge a few years earlier. The Tay bridge was the longest in the world at the time of its construction in 1878; its loss [along with a locomotive, six carriages and 75 lives], was a blow to national prestige. This was the single greatest structural failure in these islands. It couldn't happen again.\" It didn't. Today's great bridges are nearly all held up by suspension cables. Forth, Severn and Humber road bridges all sway in the wind, yet we trust them not to give way to gravity as the Tacoma Narrows bridge, in Washington state, did in 1940. \"Gallopin' Gertie\", just 19 months old and so named because of her sick-making vertical oscillations, got herself into a mother of a twist that November. Twisting and shaking for 45 minutes, one sidewalk rose 28ft above the other before the cables snapped and Gertie gave up the ghost. A freak occurrence we say, and put it down to that. Entire technologies can be almost completely obliterated by major accidents - recall the fires that destroyed the R101 and Hindenburg airships in the 1930s - but in most cases, the spirit of opti mism triumphs over the dark angel of experience. In 1990 traces of benzene were found in Perrier at the height of the water's success in restaurants worldwide. One hundred and sixty million green bottles were recalled from the shelves of bistros, hotels and grocery stores. An investigation kept the sparkling water off the market for several months. This should have been time enough for Perrier's rivals, such as Evian and San Pellegrino, to sparkle. But no one had become ill and no one had died. \"Helleau,\" said the posters that June. The benzene incident has been forgotten. \"Perrier,\" says Peter Marsh, \"was a temporary accident. With effective PR it was easy to get public confidence back. But when people start believing that a certain food is truly toxic then you'll find an almost religious fervour against it. Evidence for the product will be misread. Unreason rules the roost.\" As, of course, it did in 1989 when a salmonella scare - real enough, but overegged - scrambled British brains. In our millions we took against the humble egg and with it Edwina Currie, a junior agriculture minister, who was duly sacrificed. A few years later came BSE and the unedifying sight of John Gummer, John Major's secretary of state for the environment, force-feeding his unfortunate daughter with a burger to prove to the press that she would not suffer from eating British beef. \"We've seen people becoming increasingly fearful of food because of BSE and GM scares\", says Marsh. \"Today there are influential organisations virtually dedicated to driving these fears.\" Much the same applies to the continuing debate over the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine. This began in 1996 when an article in the British Medical Journal linked it to autism. It caused a national scare among parents that has yet to abate. \"The article was based on a study of just 25 children,\" a department of health spokesperson wearily points out. \"No causal link was established between autism and the vaccine. Every single bit of research that has been done on the topic since then has shown results to the contrary of the original study, but people still go on about it and parents are still worried.\" Our reaction to technologies that we believe to have failed or to be dangerous is undoubtedly confused. Concorde lets us down fatally for the first time in almost 25 years and it is promptly consigned to the scrapyard of history. And yet we may well rue its passing. Scares come and go. Has the Channel tunnel led to a plague of foreign rats and rabies in Little Britain? No. Has John Gummer's unfortunate daughter succumbed to BSE? No. Was anyone in a power suit poisoned by a bottle of Perrier? Again, no. Not long ago I got to drive a Chevrolet Corvair. (This was the car that made Ralph Nader's name as a champion of consumer rights in the 60s. Nader's book Unsafe at Any Speed did an effective j'accuse job on the rear-engined American sedan.) \"You're not going to drive one really, are you?\" asked an American friend. \"You're crazy. You'll kill yourself.\" I didn't because the car I drove was a '68 model; its rear suspension, the source of the car's troubles between 1960 and 1963, had been well and truly sorted out. The car drove safely, just as transatlantic liners sailed more safely after the sinking of the Titanic, as railway bridges were made safer after the Tay Bridge disaster, as suspension bridges were after the Tacoma Narrows incident. Sometimes our faith in progress is dented, but although you might not want to travel on one, airships are still blimping through the air 63 years on from the Hindenburg fire. And Concorde - the magnificent flying machine that fell to earth - might yet defy the obituarists.",

      "bodyText": "An uncontrolled chain reaction in the engine compartment of the stricken Russian nuclear submarine Kursk was \"the worst case scenario\" being contemplated by Russian experts yesterday. If that happened the fuel would heat up to 1800 to 2000C, enough to melt the engine compartment and outer casing, releasing molten fuel onto the seabed. Mils Bohmer, a Russian nuclear physicist, said this would release fission products like plutonium, caesium and uranium into the fertile fishing grounds of the Barents sea. However, the true state of the reactors is not yet known. \"We were told that the first stage of shutting the reactors down had been completed, but there is no word on what happened after that,\" he said. \"If the crew managed to shut them down completely then they should remain safe, but if not then the fuel elements may start to heat up and begin an uncontrolled chain reaction.\" Mr Bohmer was speaking in Oslo, where he has been helping the Norwegian environmental group the Bellona Foundation in its efforts to get the derelict submarines of the Russian fleet made safe. He said because there had been an explosion in the forward area it was not possible to know the effect on the crew in the engine compartment at the rear had been or how much time they may have had to act. The reactor in the submarine was of a new design with a \"natural\" cooling system which works even if there is no electrical power, but it might not be effective if there was damage or the reactor had not been fully shut down. William Peden, a Greenpeace disarmament campaigner, said that the automatic cooling system worked on convection and its efficiency would be badly affected because the stricken vessel was lying on its side. \"There is also concern because the explosion would have caused a breach in the hull part of the containment if the radioactivity begins to leak out,\" he said. \"There is a real fear of a meltdown if the cooling system does work properly. To protect the area from serious radioactive pollution the Russians have no alternative but to raise the sub.\" Mr Bohmer believed the Russians would want to raise the sub anyway because it was in relatively shallow water - 108 metres (353ft) - and, as a relatively new boat it contains military secrets the Russians would be keen to protect from other powers. In one sense the sea is the best place for damaged nuclear equipment because of the dilution and cooling effect of vast quantities of sea water. However, the Kursk has gone down in one of the most productive fisheries in the world, where Norwegians catch large quantities of cod, some of which is exported for English fish and chips. The Russians have suffered nuclear accidents there before. However, the Komsomolets, which sunk in April 1989, rests in 1,850 metres (6,069ft) of water and although it is leaking slightly is not contaminating fishing grounds. Yesterday the news from the area of the Kursk was good. Tests of water and air samples by the Norwegian Nuclear Protection Authority said five water samples and two air samples gathered through large filters on Tuesday showed no trace of abnormal radiation. The samples were gathered by Norwegian military vessels monitoring the site.

      "bodyText": "A British rescue team equipped with a unique minisub is due to leave the Norwegian port of Trondheim today in what may be the last hope for Russian sailors trapped aboard the Kursk. The minisub, the LR5 rescue vehicle, is not expected to arrive at the site of the accident in the Barents Sea until Saturday. It has never before been used in a real emergency. The LR5 can attach a \"mating wedge\" to the escape hatch of a submarine listing at an angle of 60 degrees, the bow-down position in which defence officials believe the Kursk has been resting over 100 metres down. A raging Arctic storm whipped up high waves all day yesterday, defeating repeated Russian navy attempts to get rescue capsules to dock with the huge stricken vessel. No signs of life were detected from the Kursk for the first time in five days, fuelling fears that it was too late for the British attempt to succeed where the Russians had failed. The deputy prime minister, Ilya Klebanov, said the fact that the crew had stopped making SOS signals by tapping on the hull of the submarine might not mean \"anything terrible\", but northern fleet officers in Murmansk said it could augur \"something sad\". The Russian navy chief has said repeatedly that oxygen supplies on the submarine will last only until tomorrow, while others fear that the oxygen might have run out already. Using two rescue capsules sent down from a surface ship, the Russians tried at least five times yesterday to lock on to the submarine's main escape hatch on the upper stern. But the stormy weather, the strong underwater currents, and the lack of visibility all frustrated attempts to lock on to the listing submarine. The Russian rescue craft, manned by crews of three, ran out of oxygen and one was damaged while surfacing. The chief designer of the rescue craft said the vessels had not been used for years and that few Russian sailors had any training in how to use them. The British LR5 also has a crew of three, and acts as an underwater lifeboat for up to 16 people at a time. A \"transfer skirt\" fixed to the escape hatch of the submarine equalises pressure by pumping out water, creating an airlock. The hatches of the submarine and the LR5 are then opened to enable the sailors to be transferred. The LR5 would then be steered to the surface, releasing the sailors, and return to collect others from the stricken submarine. The 34-strong rescue party includes navy divers, doctors, and interpreters. As well as the LR5, they will be equipped with a remote operated vehicle, the Scorpio, which will make an initial reconnaissance and clear any obstructions. The equipment was flown yesterday in a Russian Antonov to Trondheim from Prestwick airport near Glasgow.

It was being transferred last night onto the Normand Pioneer, a chartered vessel which will act as the mother ship for the operation. Decompression chambers were flown on ahead in RAF Hercules aircraft. Norway said yesterday it had agreed to a Russian request to send divers and possibly ships to help rescue the Kursk's crew. The Norwegian foreign ministry said a divers' mother ship now in the Haltenbanken area off north Norway was heading for the area of the Barents Sea above the crippled Kursk nuclear submarine. \"The vessel is starting to move north,\" foreign minister Thorbjoern Jagland said in a television interview. \"These are professional divers who can contribute in many ways.

      "body": "<p>The North Korean poet Oh Yong-jae knew he would not meet his mother yesterday, but that did not diminish the pain.</p> <p>The divided families chosen for the North-South exchange were at last able to meet individually after the emotional mass reunion of the previous day.</p> <p>Mr Oh's two younger brothers were there to welcome him in his hotel room on the second day. They brought him watches and clothes to take back to the poverty-stricken North.</p> <p>Mr Oh had brought a photo of his parents printed on a thin black slice of stone. He put it in the window and bowed deeply three times. Then with trembling hands he began to read a set of poems - Song for the Dead - dedicated to his mother.</p> <p>The tale of the people's poet Oh Yong-jae in a Korea divided for 50 years, and the grief which he and his brothers feel, sums up the experience of several million Koreans - even if they cannot all express it in verse.</p> <p>Mr Oh \"went North\" to become a volunteer soldier shortly before the Korean war in 1950. It was a time of intense partisan feelings in a country divided by the 1945 intervention of the US and the Soviet Union.</p> <p>A large number of southerners who \"went North\" are in the group of 100 people who are now meeting their long lost families in Seoul. Many young people were fleeing the brutal purges and the repressive society of the US-backed Syngman Rhee regime in the South.</p> <p>But once the Korean war began, far more Koreans \"went South\", many fleeing from communism, others simply displaced by the fighting. Relatives were left behind or simply lost in the chaos.</p> <p>According to the South's statistics, 1m people crossed to the South during the three years' war. About 100,000 went in the other direction or were captured and stayed there.</p> <p>Mr Oh stayed in the North and soon began to distinguish himself as a poet. He wrote patriotic verses, including Tower of Juche, now inscribed on the monument which celebrates Mr Kim's famous doctrine of self-reliance.</p> <p>Though shattered by the war, North Korea industrialised rapidly under Kim Il-sung's fiercely nationalistic leadership, taking help from China and the Soviet Union.</p> <p>South Korea began its own economic advance in the 1970s under the dictator Park Chung-hee, modelled partly on Japan - Korea's former colonial ruler.</p> <p>Mr Oh's younger brother Oh Hyong-jae graduated from a South Korean military academy, then studied mathematics and computer science in the US. Before the brothers were reunited, Hyong-jae expressed some worries about the meeting. \"My brother might be a complete leftist,\" he said. \"I am an anti-communist who graduated from an army school and studied in the US. Maybe we have to be cautious.\" But yesterday all was forgotten as they remembered their parents.</p> <p>Their mother died in 1995.

      "bodyText": "The North Korean poet Oh Yong-jae knew he would not meet his mother yesterday, but that did not diminish the pain. The divided families chosen for the North-South exchange were at last able to meet individually after the emotional mass reunion of the previous day. Mr Oh's two younger brothers were there to welcome him in his hotel room on the second day. They brought him watches and clothes to take back to the poverty-stricken North. Mr Oh had brought a photo of his parents printed on a thin black slice of stone. He put it in the window and bowed deeply three times. Then with trembling hands he began to read a set of poems - Song for the Dead - dedicated to his mother. The tale of the people's poet Oh Yong-jae in a Korea divided for 50 years, and the grief which he and his brothers feel, sums up the experience of several million Koreans - even if they cannot all express it in verse. Mr Oh \"went North\" to become a volunteer soldier shortly before the Korean war in 1950. It was a time of intense partisan feelings in a country divided by the 1945 intervention of the US and the Soviet Union. A large number of southerners who \"went North\" are in the group of 100 people who are now meeting their long lost families in Seoul. Many young people were fleeing the brutal purges and the repressive society of the US-backed Syngman Rhee regime in the South. But once the Korean war began, far more Koreans \"went South\", many fleeing from communism, others simply displaced by the fighting. Relatives were left behind or simply lost in the chaos. According to the South's statistics, 1m people crossed to the South during the three years' war. About 100,000 went in the other direction or were captured and stayed there. Mr Oh stayed in the North and soon began to distinguish himself as a poet. He wrote patriotic verses, including Tower of Juche, now inscribed on the monument which celebrates Mr Kim's famous doctrine of self-reliance. Though shattered by the war, North Korea industrialised rapidly under Kim Il-sung's fiercely nationalistic leadership, taking help from China and the Soviet Union. South Korea began its own economic advance in the 1970s under the dictator Park Chung-hee, modelled partly on Japan - Korea's former colonial ruler. Mr Oh's younger brother Oh Hyong-jae graduated from a South Korean military academy, then studied mathematics and computer science in the US. Before the brothers were reunited, Hyong-jae expressed some worries about the meeting. \"My brother might be a complete leftist,\" he said. \"I am an anti-communist who graduated from an army school and studied in the US. Maybe we have to be cautious.\" But yesterday all was forgotten as they remembered their parents. Their mother died in 1995. Direct communication between North and South is banned, so a Southern poet sent news of her death via a third country. Mr Oh then sat down to write his sequence of poems, starting with a bitter reflection on divided Korea, Heartlessness (see below). Pyongyang's 100 include other famous names: painters, scientists, doctors and actors. Seoul's list has a much broader social mix, chosen mainly by computer. Pyongyang is anxious to correct the South's image of the North as backward. The South's economic growth in the past 20 years, although now flagging, has been phenomenal. North Korea lags desperately behind the South, suffering industrial stagnation and years of acute food shortage in the countryside. In spite of the euphoria created by the June summit between the two leaders, the gap between the societies is vast. \"We will start exchanging our feelings [about our mother]\", says younger brother Hyong-jae, \"and gradually, if possible, move into the subject of politics and economics.\" Similarly, North and South Korea are moving ahead with the process of detente by focusing on common ground. They are tackling the problem of divided families, rebuilding communications and railways severed by the Korean war, and expanding tourism. But as Mr Oh and the other relatives prepare to return home tomorrow in different directions, there is more optimism across Korea than at any time in the past 50 years. Heartless by Oh Yong-jae Are you gone Are you really gone? Mother, mother, I don't want to believe it! You promised to stay alive till we met again; You said my letters and pictures had brought happiness. You are not the kind of mother who breaks her promises; I am not the kind of son who won't believe in them. But promises and trust cannot conquer time; Our family separation lasted too long. Our country's division is too heartless. Division has no feelings.",

      "bodyText": "Aviation experts were last night writing Concorde's obituary as safety officials warned that modifications to the supersonic jet could take \"months not weeks\" to implement. Airline industry observers said the extensive costs of ensuring that the ageing model could fly once more might render it commercially unviable. The civil aviation authority confirmed that it was withdrawing the plane's certificate of airworthiness because of a \"freak\" tyre burst that caused last month's crash of an Air France Concorde in Paris, which cost 113 lives. British Airways responded by insisting that it would resume operations as soon as possible, had only cancelled services until early September, and could restart them with just 24 hours' notice. But such optimism was dampened by analysts who said it would rapidly become cheaper to allow the 30-year-old plane, which brings in just \u00a320m profit a year for BA but costs \u00a350m to maintain, to die. And even if Concorde does fly again, there is no guarantee that it would be supersonic. The sombre prediction of the end of Concorde's commercial flying history came as questions were asked as to why the CAA and BA had taken almost three weeks to ground the seven British planes after the Paris crash, despite knowing almost from the start that a tyre burst had occurred. Air France indefinitely grounded its five-strong fleet on July 25, the day of the disaster. Yesterday, both BA and the CAA said they had stuck by the letter of the law, with the regulatory body emphasising that it could not suspend certificates of airworthiness with no firm information. \"We have acted in a responsible, prudent way,\" the CAA chairman, Sir Malcolm Field, said. But the authority admitted that 70 tyre bursts had taken place since Concorde started flying in 1976, with seven causing fuel tanks to rupture. This awareness of the problem, but failure to act on it, was criticised by experts. \"The vulnerability has been known since 1979,\" said Frank Taylor, director of the aviation safety centre at Cranfield University. The CAA has only banned an aircraft from flying once before, in 1979, when public confidence in the DC-10 plunged after two serious accidents.",

But the research also raises huge ethical questions. </p> <p>Embryos are already used - under strictly controlled conditions - for fertility research. After more than a year of deliberation, a committee led by Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer, yesterday recommended that surplus embryos could also be used for research into new medical treatments. </p> <p>The committee also gave the all-clear for limited experiments in so-called \"therapeutic cloning\". This would make possible the transfer of genes from one person into the nucleus of a cell taken from another. </p> <p>Humans start life as one fertilised egg and end it as a collection of trillions of specialised cells of more than 200 kinds. Embryos which are a few days old, are a collection of 100 or 200 cells, any one of which could turn into any part of a human. These are embryo stem cells. </p> <p>Researchers have already used adult stem cells to renew bone marrow tissue . But, the Donaldson report says, embryo stem cells could be used to repair nerve damage in stroke victims, make insulin for diabetics or treat inherited disorders. </p> <p>Ideally, scientists want to learn how to \"reprogramme\" adult cells and use them to make new organ tissues. But research on embryo stem cells could be the only way to learn how to do this. </p> <p>Dr Donaldson's expert panel of scientists, lawyers, surgeons and ethicists recommended that research on embryos either created by cell nuclear replacement - the technique that made Dolly the cloned sheep - or by in vitro fertilisation, should be permitted. But this research would be subject to control by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Before the HFEA licensed the use of any cloned embryos, it would have to be satisfied there was no other way to proceed. </p> <p>Between 1991 and 1998, fertility researchers handled more than 48,000 embryos not needed for in vitro fertilisation, all of them less than 14 days old. </p> <p>The committee said that the individuals whose eggs or sperm were used to create the embryos should give specific consent. The mixing of animal eggs and human cells would be forbidden and it would remain a criminal offence to implant an embryo created by cell nuclear replacement into the uterus of a woman. </p> <p>The committee also recommended possible legislation to govern the use of embryo cells in any future treatments for disease - and suggested creating a \"library\" of stem cells for researchers to use. </p> <p>But the committee said that any real healthcare benefits were years away. The embryo research might only be a stage on the way to a medical \"holy grail\" - in which scientists learned to switch on early stem cells from patients, grow them in the laboratory, and then implant them. </p> <p>\"It would also result in tissue that was genetically compatible. You wouldn't have the problems of rejection,\" Prof Donaldson said. \"The technique isn't currently feasible, it is a theoretical idea that scientists believe one day may be possible. They believe that the phase of a better understanding of research into embryonic stem cells is vital to getting the breakthrough.\" </p> <p>The report conceded that some people would argue that the research was unethical, others that the embryo required no moral attention whatsoever, and a third group that there was an ethical issue which had to be weighed against the benefits of any such research. </p> <p>The decision drew fire yesterday. A spokesman for the anti-abortion group Life said: \"Therapeutic cloning _ is a further trivialisation of human life. It exploits human beings at the most vulnerable stage of their lives - it is neo-cannibalism.\" </p> <p><strong> Destruction</strong><br> </p> <p> Cardinal Winning, the Catholic archbishop of Glasgow, said \"Obtaining stem cells from a human embryo is morally wrong, because it involves the destruction of a human life.

Mr Gore believes that he needs to energise his party to combat Mr Bush's current opinion poll lead, and the promises in tonight's speech confirm that he is much more ready than his predecessor to offer a bread-and-butter appeal to traditional Democratic voters.</p> <p>Mr Gore flew in to Los Angeles yesterday, accompanied by his wife Tipper, in time for the proud parents to watch television coverage of the debut convention speech of his daughter Karenna Schiff.</p> <p>The convention was due to formally nominate Mr Gore as the Democratic challenger after the time-honoured roll-call of states and following a series of tributes which ranged from the British scientist Professor Stephen Hawking to one from Mr Gore's Harvard contemporary, the actor Tommy Lee Jones.</p> <p>Mr Gore entered Los Angeles as \"the standard-bearer of the party representing the new-guard generation\", his spokesman Chris Lehane told reporters.</p> <p>Earlier, before leaving the campaign trail in Michigan, Mr Gore underscored his efforts to mobilise core groups of supporters by chatting to teachers in Detroit.</p> <p>Mr Gore also took time out to praise his former rival Bill Bradley for his barnstorming pro-Gore speech to the convention on Tuesday. \"I thought he did a fabulous job. I really appreciated it,\" Mr Gore said.</p> <p>Mr Bradley was one of a succession of party icons, mostly to the left of Mr Gore, who revved up the Democratic convention with a series of emotional and populist speeches.</p> <p>The speakers included Caroline Kennedy, the only surviving member of President John Kennedy's family, giving her first address to a convention in the city where her father was nominated in 1960. Senator Edward Kennedy and the Rev Jesse Jackson also spoke.</p> <p>After an awkward start dominated by the party's farewells to Mr Clinton, the Los Angeles convention has moved into gear as a vehicle for the promotion of Mr Gore and running mate Joe Lieberman, who was making his own acceptance speech last night.</p> <p>Mr Lieberman was preceded at yesterday's session by a succession of Democratic heavyweights from all wings of the party, ranging from the former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin to the Democrats' congressional leader Dick Gephardt. There was music from Mary Chapin Carpenter and Stevie Wonder.</p> <p>Mr Lieberman said yesterday that his speech was an opportunity \"to speak to the country about who I am\", but since his arrival in Los Angeles on Tuesday the Democrats' vice-presidential nominee has also moved decisively to mend fences with the party's black activists and with the entertainment industry, two key groups of Democratic supporters who have been the most wary about embracing the Connecticut senator.</p> <p>On Tuesday night Mr Lieberman met privately with the Democratic black caucus and, in what was reported as a well-received speech, assured them that he was a committed supporter of affirmative action.</p> <p>\"I have supported affirmative action, I do support affirmative action, and I will support affirmative action,\" Mr Lieberman told the meeting. \"Why? Because history and current reality make it necessary.\"</p> <p>\"It clears the air,\" the influential Los Angeles congresswoman Maxine Waters, previously a leading sceptic about the choice of Mr Lieberman, said afterwards. \"I feel comfortable in campaigning for him.\"</p> <p>Mr Lieberman also made a priority of attending a Beverly Hills reception hosted by the film producer David Salzman.</p> <p>The visit was part of an effort to calm Hollywood fears that Mr Lieberman would continue his high-profile anti-obscenity campaign against the entertainment industry if elected.</p>",

But the speech is also emerging as a significant contrast with the Clinton agenda. Mr Gore believes that he needs to energise his party to combat Mr Bush's current opinion poll lead, and the promises in tonight's speech confirm that he is much more ready than his predecessor to offer a bread-and-butter appeal to traditional Democratic voters. Mr Gore flew in to Los Angeles yesterday, accompanied by his wife Tipper, in time for the proud parents to watch television coverage of the debut convention speech of his daughter Karenna Schiff. The convention was due to formally nominate Mr Gore as the Democratic challenger after the time-honoured roll-call of states and following a series of tributes which ranged from the British scientist Professor Stephen Hawking to one from Mr Gore's Harvard contemporary, the actor Tommy Lee Jones. Mr Gore entered Los Angeles as \"the standard-bearer of the party representing the new-guard generation\", his spokesman Chris Lehane told reporters. Earlier, before leaving the campaign trail in Michigan, Mr Gore underscored his efforts to mobilise core groups of supporters by chatting to teachers in Detroit. Mr Gore also took time out to praise his former rival Bill Bradley for his barnstorming pro-Gore speech to the convention on Tuesday. \"I thought he did a fabulous job. I really appreciated it,\" Mr Gore said. Mr Bradley was one of a succession of party icons, mostly to the left of Mr Gore, who revved up the Democratic convention with a series of emotional and populist speeches. The speakers included Caroline Kennedy, the only surviving member of President John Kennedy's family, giving her first address to a convention in the city where her father was nominated in 1960. Senator Edward Kennedy and the Rev Jesse Jackson also spoke. After an awkward start dominated by the party's farewells to Mr Clinton, the Los Angeles convention has moved into gear as a vehicle for the promotion of Mr Gore and running mate Joe Lieberman, who was making his own acceptance speech last night. Mr Lieberman was preceded at yesterday's session by a succession of Democratic heavyweights from all wings of the party, ranging from the former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin to the Democrats' congressional leader Dick Gephardt. There was music from Mary Chapin Carpenter and Stevie Wonder. Mr Lieberman said yesterday that his speech was an opportunity \"to speak to the country about who I am\", but since his arrival in Los Angeles on Tuesday the Democrats' vice-presidential nominee has also moved decisively to mend fences with the party's black activists and with the entertainment industry, two key groups of Democratic supporters who have been the most wary about embracing the Connecticut senator. On Tuesday night Mr Lieberman met privately with the Democratic black caucus and, in what was reported as a well-received speech, assured them that he was a committed supporter of affirmative action. \"I have supported affirmative action, I do support affirmative action, and I will support affirmative action,\" Mr Lieberman told the meeting. \"Why? Because history and current reality make it necessary.\" \"It clears the air,\" the influential Los Angeles congresswoman Maxine Waters, previously a leading sceptic about the choice of Mr Lieberman, said afterwards. \"I feel comfortable in campaigning for him.\" Mr Lieberman also made a priority of attending a Beverly Hills reception hosted by the film producer David Salzman. The visit was part of an effort to calm Hollywood fears that Mr Lieberman would continue his high-profile anti-obscenity campaign against the entertainment industry if elected.",

      "bodyText": "Devising modifications to ensure that Concorde can take to the skies once more will be such a lengthy and intricate process that it could prove too expensive, aviation specialists and financial analysts said yesterday. Changes are expected to be made to the tyres, the material covering the wings, and possibly the hydraulic and electric systems. But improvements to the engine intakes - where air enters before causing fuel in the engine to ignite - could prove so complex that British Airways and Air France may decide it is no longer commercially viable to pursue them, while any change to the plane's weight could render it incapable of completing a transatlantic flight. The first issue that Concorde's manufacturers, BAE Systems, Airbus UK and Aerospatiale in France, will have to address is how to strengthen the tyres to prevent another blowout, the fault finally identified yesterday as the \"primary cause of the accident\". But \"however strong you make them, no tyre is guaranteed not to burst, especially if there are hot pieces of metal around,\" said David Learmont of Flight International magazine. And if stronger tyres burst \"the bits that fly off them will fly away with greater energy, because they're heavier\". A more viable option would be to strengthen the metal around the part of the wing incorporating the fuel tank. Frank Taylor, director of the Aviation Safety Centre at Cranfield University, said: \"At present an aluminium alloy is used, but there are thousands of these, and since Concorde was developed there may well be one less liable to have a hole punched in it.\" There is the further problem of how to prevent debris from getting into the engines, as happened - the air accident investigations branch admitted yesterday - in the Paris disaster. \"It's fair to say there's more chance of tyre debris going into Concorde's engines than those of other aircraft,\" said Frank Taylor, \"but there's no way the position of the engine can be altered.\" Ultimately BA and Air France are likely to be driven by two issues in deciding how far they should go to get Concorde airborne: the public's perception of its safety and money. For an ageing plane that costs \u00a350m a year to maintain yet returns estimated profits of only \u00a37m for Air France and \u00a320m-\u00a340m for BA, there may be little point in making changes.",

A spokesman for the environmental group said: \"There are lots of moral issues involved here. </p> <p>\"We think that people should know if products are genetically modified, so that they can make decisions themselves about what to buy.\" </p>",

Further ahead, the two firms will sell AAT for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Bayer already makes a version of AAT distilled from human blood donations, but there is a chronic shortage of supply - the company says it only has enough to treat 5,000 patients. Bayer said that yesterday's deal \"unlocks the possibility of producing unlimited quantities\". PPL has nearly 1,000 transgenic sheep, most of which are kept on a high-security farm in New Zealand. The company said that it intends to expand its flock to around 2,000. PPL is building a factory in Scotland to extract AAT from the milk of its sheep. Analysts said AAT sales could peak at \u00a3100m annually. PPL is likely to get about 20% of the proceeds. The shares closed 7.5p higher at 164p. Earlier this week, PPL's shares slumped amid concerns about health risks in xenotransplantation, under which the company alters pigs so they grow hearts, lungs and livers suitable for human transplant. Mr James insisted yesterday that he was unaware of any new health risks, adding that PPL was in talks with commercial partners and venture capital groups interested in investing in the technology. Sheepish admission on modified wool The woolly sweaters frequently favoured by environmental activists could contain material from PPL Therapeutics' genetically-modified sheep, it emerged yesterday. PPL's chief executive, Ron James, said the company makes \u00a35,000 a year by selling wool from its flock to the Wool Board, which distributes it to textiles companies throughout the country. Concern The sideline is a useful earner for the company, which alters sheep so that they produce therapeutic proteins in their milk. The animals' carcasses are destroyed and PPL does not allow their meat to be eaten. Mr James insisted that genetically-modified wool offered no cause for alarm. \"We don't want people thinking their clothes are going to glow in the dark or anything,\" he said. Greenpeace expressed concern, nonetheless. A spokesman for the environmental group said: \"There are lots of moral issues involved here. \"We think that people should know if products are genetically modified, so that they can make decisions themselves about what to buy.\"",

      "bodyText": "The civil aviation authority's revelation yesterday that Concorde has suffered 70 tyre-related incidents makes it plain that last month's Paris disaster could have happened at any time during the plane's 26-year commercial history. As the world's only supersonic jetliner's airworthiness certificate was formally withdrawn, aviation experts in Britain and France were at pains to point out that the accident, in which 113 people died, was the result of a freak, even unique, sequence of events. But the fact that a single tyre blowout could cause potentially catastrophic damage to Concorde's landing gear, wings and fuel tanks was known as long ago as 1979 and, despite a string of design and maintenance improvements, has been repeatedly demonstrated since. Concorde has suffered seven tyre bursts that resulted in punctured fuel tanks. Two, in 1979, happened to Air France planes taking off and landing in Washington, triggering a mandatory upgrade in tyre specifications and the introduction of a puncture alarm system. But by 1982, following half a dozen similar incidents, including a holed fuel tank on a British Airways Concorde taking off from New York, the US national transportation safety board was still sufficiently alarmed to order extra safety measures: Concorde's landing gear and tyres were to be inspected before every take-off. The subsequent serious incidents, in 1985, 1988 and 1993, all involved BA Concordes at Heathrow and New York's JFK. In each, tyre bursts led to pieces of landing gear or rubber being \"ingested\" into the aircraft's engines and wing skins being damaged, with fuel leaking from the punctured tanks. Further improvements were ordered in 1983, 1985 and 1993, when the landing gear's water deflector - pieces of which had punched holes in the wings - was strengthened. But through all the changes, Concorde's wing skins remained vulnerable to flying debris. After the Paris crash both Air France and BA immediately grounded their Concorde fleets as the investigation got under way. Despite pressure from pilots and Air France, the French transport minister, Jean-Clause Gayssot, declared the plane would not fly again until \"all the circumstances concerning this complicated accident are fully explained\". For its part, BA said it was confident in the fundamental safety of Concorde's design and resumed flights the following day. But within three days of the accident investigators found shredded pieces of Concorde tyre on the runway and concluded that at least one, possibly two, tyres had blown. On August 10 the French accident investigation bureau BEA came up with its first tentative scenario for the crash: \"The explosion of the tyre resulted in large pieces of rubber, the heaviest of which weighed more than 9lb, being thrown up with great force as the plane was advancing at high speed [about 195mph],\" it said. \"For reasons yet to be determined, damage was then caused very rapidly to one or more fuel tanks on the left wing, with as a consequence a major fuel leak and the fire.\" But not until formal notification from the investigators on Tuesday were BA's Concordes taken out of service. Questions will now be asked exactly why it took the British airline so long to ground its planes. Yesterday the CAA underlined the unique nature of the Paris accident.

So in each case the regulators had focused on modifying the metal parts, he said. The CAA's chairman, Sir Malcolm Field, said the authority \"maintained its position that until we received the first evidence from the joint investigation team we were happy for [BA's Concordes] to continue operations.\" In the light of Concorde's tyre history passengers may have a right to wonder. Runway alerts Concorde has had some 70 tyre or wheel related incidents. Seven have led to serious damage and could have ended in catastrophe: \u0095 June 15 1979 Two tyres on Air France plane burst at Washington.

Only the US has the power to provoke a world war. Only the US can re-engineer the global economy.</p> <p>As the Transatlantic Economic Partnership - which is quietly \"harmonising\" our laws with those of North America - demonstrates, Washington now exercises more control over the lives of British people than Westminster.</p> <p>We will never, of course, be allowed to influence the world's most important political decisions. But this autumn we can do the next best thing, which is to plead with our friends and colleagues in the United States to cast their votes against Al Gore. The only hope for both America and us is that George Bush wins.</p> <p>A Bush presidency would, of course, be an unmitigated disaster. This poisonous political pygmy owes everything to the dollar and nothing to democracy. Under his governorship Texas has killed more convicts, left more children without health provision and poisoned more of its own air and water than any other state. Its spending on education, public hospitals and social services has all but collapsed.</p> <p>As president, Bush would cut the scant taxes rich Americans pay, disabling America's residual public provision. He would dump the minimum wage, abandon affirmative action, sell off national parks and destroy trades unions.</p> <p>He has suggested that he would like to see more adventures of the kind the US pursued in Nicaragua and Grenada, and fewer humanitarian missions.

      "bodyText": "Everyone on earth should be allowed to vote in American elections. All the major decisions about the future of world are now brokered by the United States. Only the US has the power to provoke a world war. Only the US can re-engineer the global economy. As the Transatlantic Economic Partnership - which is quietly \"harmonising\" our laws with those of North America - demonstrates, Washington now exercises more control over the lives of British people than Westminster. We will never, of course, be allowed to influence the world's most important political decisions. But this autumn we can do the next best thing, which is to plead with our friends and colleagues in the United States to cast their votes against Al Gore. The only hope for both America and us is that George Bush wins. A Bush presidency would, of course, be an unmitigated disaster. This poisonous political pygmy owes everything to the dollar and nothing to democracy. Under his governorship Texas has killed more convicts, left more children without health provision and poisoned more of its own air and water than any other state. Its spending on education, public hospitals and social services has all but collapsed. As president, Bush would cut the scant taxes rich Americans pay, disabling America's residual public provision. He would dump the minimum wage, abandon affirmative action, sell off national parks and destroy trades unions. He has suggested that he would like to see more adventures of the kind the US pursued in Nicaragua and Grenada, and fewer humanitarian missions. His incomprehension of world affairs will reinforce American isolationism, while his plans for a national missile defence system will launch a new nuclear arms race. Anyone with a grain of political sense, in other words, would be mad to support George Bush. But the biggest threat to Al Gore is a defection of Democratic voters not to the Republicans, but to the Greens, and their presidential candidate, Ralph Nader.

      "body": "<p>Japanese investment bank Nomura yesterday refused to concede defeat in its four-month battle for control of Hyder, the Welsh utility group, despite a takeover panel ruling in favour of rival bidders Western Power Distribution. </p> <p>The panel yesterday rejected Nomura's appeal against the panel executive's decision to allow a 365p a share offer made by WPD in a sealed bid last Friday. The WPD offer topped Nomura's existing offer by 5p a share. </p> <p>A Nomura spokesman said the bank was still considering its options. Executives from its London-based principal finance group, which has led its bid for Hyder, spent the day closeted with their financial and legal advisers. </p> <p>The panel, which held a day-long meeting at its office in the London stock exchange building on Wednesday, said it would publish the reasons for its decision tomorrow. </p> <p>Hyder, which has been the subject of competing bids from Nomura and US-owned WPD, said it would respond to the panel's announcement \"in due course\".

      "bodyText": "Japanese investment bank Nomura yesterday refused to concede defeat in its four-month battle for control of Hyder, the Welsh utility group, despite a takeover panel ruling in favour of rival bidders Western Power Distribution. The panel yesterday rejected Nomura's appeal against the panel executive's decision to allow a 365p a share offer made by WPD in a sealed bid last Friday. The WPD offer topped Nomura's existing offer by 5p a share. A Nomura spokesman said the bank was still considering its options. Executives from its London-based principal finance group, which has led its bid for Hyder, spent the day closeted with their financial and legal advisers. The panel, which held a day-long meeting at its office in the London stock exchange building on Wednesday, said it would publish the reasons for its decision tomorrow. Hyder, which has been the subject of competing bids from Nomura and US-owned WPD, said it would respond to the panel's announcement \"in due course\". A spokesman said it was waiting for clarification from the panel. WPD said it was not prepared to comment, while Nomura's future intentions were still unclear. City sources said Nomura's first option would be to seek leave to appeal to the takeover panel's appeals committee, which is chaired by Sir Michael Kerr, a former lord justice of appeal. The committee is usually made up of its chairman or deputy chairman, and two other members of the panel who have not been previously involved in the issue at stake. Nomura is thought unlikely to consider seeking a judicial review of the panel's handling of the Hyder bids until it has explored all the panel's appeal procedures. There is an outside possibility that Nomura could still put its lower 360p offer to shareholders in the hope that it can persuade sufficient local shareholders that its plans will best solve Hyder's problems. Nomura already owns 16.2% of the group. Nomura has said it intends to retain Hyder's water and electricity operations and bring in new top management to run them. WPD abandoned an earlier plan to sell the assets of Hyder's regulated water business to a non-profit making trust after opposition from the water industry regulator. But it still intends to contract out the running of the business to United Utilities, the multi-utility group based in the north west of England. Both bidders have said that they do not intend to implement job cuts beyond the 1,000 already announced by Hyder's existing management. Hyder is heavily indebted and faces the loss of up to \u00a370m in profits this year as a result of regulatory price cuts. City bankers and investment managers, concerned about the takeover panel's handling of the Hyder bid, want to see the detailed reasoning behind yesterday's decision. The main points at issue will be the justification of the panel executive's decision to impose a sealed bid procedure in the first place and the reasons why it felt it could allow WPD's sealed bid, even though it was not announced by the executive's deadline of 4.30pm on Friday. WPD's delay in announcing its winning bid by Friday's deadline has been put down to a technicality which required its bid to be resubmitted. None of those involved has revealed what the technicality was. Welsh Assembly environment secretary Sue Essex said: \"I regret that if the takeover panel's decision stands this effectively means the break-up of the Hyder group and an end to one of Wales's most prestigious and well known companies.\" December 9 1999 Hyder cuts interim dividend and announces strategic review March 28 2000 Sharp share price rise forces Hyder to admit bid is possible April 14 Hyder says it is discussing a bid April 18 Nomura makes agreed 260p a share bid May 2 Pennsylvania Power and Light and Southern Group plan counterbid through Western Power Distribution joint venture May 2 Barclays Capital backs out of WPD plan to create non-profit vehicle for Hyder's Welsh Water business May 18 WPD revises Welsh Water sell-off plan May 31 WPD makes 300p a share bid August 1 Hyder board backs Nomura's increased bid of 320p a share. WPD raises its bid to 340p a share Aug 7 Hyder chief Graham Hawker says board now supports WPD bid Aug 9 Nomura bids 360p a share Aug 10 Takeover panel intervenes, asking for final sealed bids Aug 11 WPD's sealed bid not announced by 4.30pm deadline. Nomura appeals against panel executive's decision to allow WPD bid Aug 14 Hyder board urges shareholders to take no action until ruling of full panel is announced Aug 15 Takeover panel meets all day to consider Nomura appeal Aug 16 Panel rejects Nomura appeal and allows WPD's 365p offer to go ahead",

There is a prospect now of ancient degenerative and chronic diseases causing untold pain and misery to millions being treated and cured. Human cloning for medical research, which an expert committee headed by the government's chief medical officer said yesterday should be given the go-ahead, could turn out, one scientist suggested, to be as important as the genome project, with possibly \"even more practical benefits\". As with the genome, the research will be fundamental, going to the heart of creation. </p> <p>And there, for some religious groups, is the rub. The new research will examine how life develops from one fertilised cell to a trillion, distributed across 200 different categories in every person. A vital part of it would involve making embryo clones, using the same technique as with Dolly the sheep, but now for medical not reproductive purposes. It would mean taking the nucleus from an adult cell and placing it in an egg whose own nucleus had been removed. The egg would then subdivide and grow into an embryo. While it was still the size of a pinhead, containing 100 cells, stem cells would be extracted. </p> <p>Life, the anti-abortion group, described the proposals as \"a further trivialisation of life\". \"It exploits human beings at the most vulnerable stage of their lives - it is neo-cannibalism,\" the organisation said. Cardinal Thomas Winning, Archbishop of Glasgow and chairman of the bioethics committee of the Catholic bishops of Great Britain and Ireland, said obtaining stem cells from a human embryo was morally wrong and would \"shock and disappoint many\" because it involved the destruction of a human life. But Lord Winston, director of research at London's Hammersmith hospital, made the right response: \"Most people, when the science and possibilities are explained, will regard this as a sensible and moral decision,\" he said. </p> <p>Embryonic stem cells, unlike adult stem cells, possess the unique ability to develop into different types of tissue in the body - nerves, muscles, organs and bones - depending on the chemical cues given. Grown in a laboratory, they could be used to make replacement tissue for degenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, bone cells for osteoporosis, eye cells for macular degeneration, blood cells for cancer, insulin producing cells for diabetes, nerve cells for spinal chord injury, skin cells for burns, liver cells for hepatitis, muscle cells for congestive heart disease, or skeletal muscle cells for muscular dystrophy. The list is endless. It is not the scientists who are trivialising the debate, but Life. </p> <p>The embryo at the heart of this argument is under 14 days old, has no brain, heart or any other human feature, and is only just visible to the naked eye. A public consultation exercise by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority two years ago was unequivocal in placing the rights of patients with degenerative and chronic diseases ahead of the embryo. Ironically, research on such embryos is already permitted, so long as it is confined to fertility, contraception, or miscarriages. What is now proposed is that the law should be relaxed to allow the use of early-stage human embryos for stem cell research. It will be carefully controlled and monitored. Reproductive cloning is already effectively banned, but ministers will introduce a specific legal ban. There will be a free vote in parliament.

But chance upon it as you steer between twisting hedgerows and you'll be hard pressed to keep an eye on the road. </p> <p>What is this vast latticed bowl slung between white-capped towers, cogged and pinioned and mounted on a circle of railway track the size of a stadium? Was it some alien mother ship that placed it on the Cheshire plain 50 years ago, laying it gently like an egg while cows and sheep munched and all the people slept? What is its purpose, and how much longer before that ship returns? </p> <p>\"When it moves at night,\" says Helen Knowles, \"it makes an incredible clanking weird sort of noise.\" </p> <p>Knowles has stood beneath the telescope at night, when all the visitors have gone, and only technicians and scientists remain to steer the gigantic dish and marvel over the radio signals that it hears in the depths of space. But Knowles is not a scientist. She is the observatory's artist in residence. Employed by the visitor centre, her job is to create works near the entrance to a 35-acre arboretum that was planted on land surrounding the observatory by its first director, the visionary Sir Bernard Lovell. </p> <p>Knowles plans to make an entire floor out of leather, and is currently tanning sheep hides in pits filled with water and oak bark. But she has temporarily set this aside in favour of an even more ambitious project - an exhibition entitled Radio Halo. </p> <p>\"Radio halo\" is the term astronomers apply to a phenomenon they have observed among the far-flung galaxies. And although Knowles is less than certain what it means, she knows it's a great name for her art show. \"We are making a halo of art around the observatory,\" she says. So 11 artists have busied themselves in the woods with string and spray-paint and magnetic stars. </p> <p>Magnetic stars? \"That's right,\" says Jay Townsend. \"I cut them all out by hand, and it really did my fingers in. The things we do for art.\" </p> <p>Jay has constructed what he calls a Big Bang Simulation Unit - a sort of celestial building site in the wet grass. \"People tend to forget it's really chaotic up there,\" he says, pointing at the rain clouds but seeing far beyond them. So his installation contains a\"roadworks\" sign and an old iron roller that attracts the multi-coloured magnetic stars. </p> <p>Close by, Leo Fitzmaurice has erected another road sign. With its white lettering on a coffee-brown background, it is a perfect simulation in wood and paint of the \"heritage\" signs that urge drivers to leave the dual carriageway and sample the delights of some nearby stately home. Except that Leo's sign bears the single word \"Heaven\". </p> <p>Similar \"Heaven\" signs crop up all over the woods, but each time in a different format. Beside the pond, black and yellow warns us of danger, while a large blue and white motorway sign shows us where to turn when the path forks. But Knowles has left the path and is tramping across the grass, to where Elizabeth Stuart Smith has been working in a clearing surrounded on three sides by water. </p> <p>\"It's a very, very nice place,\" says Liz. \"Sometimes there are cows and sometimes there are ducks. And there are five of these.\" She indicates a loose cylinder of transparent acetate, staked into the soil like a flimsy wastepaper basket and filled with empty acetate parcels. May one touch it? \"But of course.\" It's very strange. \"Well yes, it is.\" </p> <p>And she describes how she sought out an astronomer one day, and asked her what she did in her laboratory beneath the great radio dish. </p> <p>\"I thought it would be very straightforward - that they would pick up a radio signal and it would mean this or it would mean that. But instead she said, 'Well, we get it, and then we sort of decode it, then we have to iron it out, then we have to colour-code the images_' And I suddenly realised that astronomy, like art, is very uncertain. A lot of it's visible, but there's so much more that is hidden.\" </p> <p>Her work is called Invisible Light, which is a reference to the radio waves that the dish can hear but that the eye cannot see. \"It's about sunshine,\" says Liz. \"But it's about shadows, too.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Gillian Nicol has been catching shadows. Down on her knees, she has clipped a patch of grass into the image cast by a young ash tree in the morning. \"And that's the shadow at 5 pm,\" she says, pointing to another unexpected shape which, edged as it is with yellow string, suggests the chalk outlines that paperback detectives trace around murder victims. \"But this one was an hour later, and you can see it's already tall and slender.\" While Nicol uses trees as sun dials, Anna Hill uses them to describe an entire galaxy. With 30 saplings grown from a 2,000-year-old yew in Wiltshire, she is mapping out a great maze in the shape of the spiral nebula - a work that will take half a century to mature. </p> <p>As Helen Knowles skips through the embryonic maze to demonstrate its cunning double spiral, Ally Wallace explains why he chose to suspend a luminous green circle in some nearby foliage. \"I like putting alien things into an environment,\" he says. Why a circle? \"Because it seems to crop up a lot in astronomy.\" Why green? \"It's a jokey science fiction colour, and it ties in with the arboretum.\" </p> <p>Everywhere, artists are dreaming up such connections, and always with a method in their seeming madness. \"Art easily communicates an idea,\" says Knowles. \"Rachel Whiteread deals with negative space and Anish Kapoor with voids. These are very difficult scientific concepts, but through art they become tangible and visible and more easily understandable than looking at algebra.\" </p> <p>She points out four human figures, which on closer inspection prove to be empty life-size cloaks cast in plaster and resin. \"They represent the four moons of Jupiter,\" says Paula Chambers, and she explains how she modelled them so that their relative sizes match those of the heavenly bodies, as do their surface appearance (cratered Callisto, smooth icy Europa and so on).

      "body": "<p>The woman in the cagoule shuffles up to the table at which David Soul sits. \"Can I be rude and ask for your autograph?\" she says giddily. \"Is it rude?\" Soul retorts gruffly before taking her pen and the napkin she wants him to sign. \"What's your name?\" </p> <p>\"Carol.\" </p> <p>He signs a wild, looping signature on the crumpling tissue paper and Carol departs, ecstatic. Soul less so. This kind of thing happens a lot. </p> <p>\"And they use that line a lot, too - 'I'm being terribly rude.' I think, if you are being rude, why are you doing this at all?\" </p> <p>Soul has a story about performing at the old Apollo in Edinburgh. \"Every time I moved, the crowd screamed uncontrollably. I couldn't hear my music and neither could they. So I had to wait them out,\" he rails. \"Ten minutes I sat there wanting to play but unable to.\" Soul is clearly a man who tolerates more than enjoys his celebrity. </p> <p>For ever remembered as Hutch, partner to Starsky in the 70s cop series, and for his music career, including 1977's biggest-selling single, Don't Give Up on Us, Baby, Soul's celebrity comes from what he has done and not what he does now, a fact that you think may irk him. It has, after all, been nearly 20 years since he last jumped in the red-and-white-striped car and Don't Give Up on Us is rarely heard outside easy-listening clubs. </p> <p>\"That's not something that concerns me,\" he says firmly. \"You make a mistake if you seek celebrity, and there are a lot of people who do seek it, but celebrity is not a career. You have to have resiliency and understanding about what it's like dealing with adoration, but celebrity is like ice cream: it melts.\" </p> <p>For Soul, it would seem, it just defrosted. Since moving to London permanently in 1995 and concentrating on acting, directing and producing theatre, he has regained some notoriety after his absence from the public radar, bar the occasional blips in the 80s when rumours of domestic violence and alcohol problems surfaced. Since his one-man Charles Aznavour tribute in 1995, he has performed at Hampstead Theatre, at the Fridge in Brixton (where he also took to the stage with Starsky and Hutch co-star Antonio \"Huggy Bear\" Fargas in a series of concerts) and in the West End. He appeared most recently in Alan Ayckbourn's Comic Potential. </p> <p>Naturally, the next step was to bring a play to Edinburgh. The play is, aptly enough, Sam Shepard's Fool for Love. Set in an American motel room, it tells of a dysfunctional family and the lure of historical revisionism. \"It is a play that resonates for me. In my history I am an old stuntman who grew up in the midwest. Innocence and betrayal are locked, self-pity and finding new horizons are locked.

      "bodyText": "The woman in the cagoule shuffles up to the table at which David Soul sits. \"Can I be rude and ask for your autograph?\" she says giddily. \"Is it rude?\" Soul retorts gruffly before taking her pen and the napkin she wants him to sign. \"What's your name?\" \"Carol.\" He signs a wild, looping signature on the crumpling tissue paper and Carol departs, ecstatic. Soul less so. This kind of thing happens a lot. \"And they use that line a lot, too - 'I'm being terribly rude.' I think, if you are being rude, why are you doing this at all?\" Soul has a story about performing at the old Apollo in Edinburgh. \"Every time I moved, the crowd screamed uncontrollably. I couldn't hear my music and neither could they. So I had to wait them out,\" he rails. \"Ten minutes I sat there wanting to play but unable to.\" Soul is clearly a man who tolerates more than enjoys his celebrity. For ever remembered as Hutch, partner to Starsky in the 70s cop series, and for his music career, including 1977's biggest-selling single, Don't Give Up on Us, Baby, Soul's celebrity comes from what he has done and not what he does now, a fact that you think may irk him. It has, after all, been nearly 20 years since he last jumped in the red-and-white-striped car and Don't Give Up on Us is rarely heard outside easy-listening clubs. \"That's not something that concerns me,\" he says firmly. \"You make a mistake if you seek celebrity, and there are a lot of people who do seek it, but celebrity is not a career. You have to have resiliency and understanding about what it's like dealing with adoration, but celebrity is like ice cream: it melts.\" For Soul, it would seem, it just defrosted. Since moving to London permanently in 1995 and concentrating on acting, directing and producing theatre, he has regained some notoriety after his absence from the public radar, bar the occasional blips in the 80s when rumours of domestic violence and alcohol problems surfaced. Since his one-man Charles Aznavour tribute in 1995, he has performed at Hampstead Theatre, at the Fridge in Brixton (where he also took to the stage with Starsky and Hutch co-star Antonio \"Huggy Bear\" Fargas in a series of concerts) and in the West End. He appeared most recently in Alan Ayckbourn's Comic Potential. Naturally, the next step was to bring a play to Edinburgh. The play is, aptly enough, Sam Shepard's Fool for Love. Set in an American motel room, it tells of a dysfunctional family and the lure of historical revisionism. \"It is a play that resonates for me. In my history I am an old stuntman who grew up in the midwest. Innocence and betrayal are locked, self-pity and finding new horizons are locked. I can't avoid those kind of things in my own life.\" Soul plays the Old Man opposite Stefan Dennis, the actor formerly known as Paul Robinson from Neighbours, and Soul's partner (and co-producer) Alexa Hamilton and his eldest son, Kristofer. Fool for Love is the first time Hamilton has been directed by Soul. \"It may be the only time in my entire life I get to tell her what to do so I'm going to enjoy it. Usually, I'm the one directed,\" he half-grimaces, half-laughs. Of his marital track record he admits, \"For Alexa, it's not easy being number five. Four marriages is sad.

According to a procedure outlined in a letter from David Hockney to the Daily Telegraph this week, a humble bathroom accessory can reveal the trade secrets of the most significant artists since the Renaissance. You thought their achievement was entirely down to extraordinary hand-and-eye coordination? According to Hockney, it was all done with mirrors. </p> <p>Hockney first posited his views about artists' use of optical aids in an article for the New Yorker magazine, published in February under the headline: \"Did the Old Masters cheat?\" It ruffled a few academic feathers, but was largely dismissed as the misguided ramblings of an increasingly eccentric figure. Now, however, a storm is brewing about Constable's brewing storms. </p> <p>The meticulously realised skies of the great 19th-century landscape artist are now at the centre of an exhibition at the National Gallery of Scotland called Constable's Clouds. The show presents Constable as the first artist to make meteorologically accurate records of genuine weather formations, with the implication that earlier painters could not see what went on over their heads. According to Neil Talboys, senior forecaster at the PA weather centre, which supplies forecasts to the British media, artists including Turner, Gainsborough and Rubens produced cloudscapes that are \"chaotic, unrealistic and simply wrong from a meteorological point of view\". </p> <p>Hockney - whose own clouds often resemble improbable little puffs of steam - leapt to the defence of all meteorologically challenged artists by pointing out that a painting, unlike a photograph, is not a fraction-of-a-second observation, but an image \"mixed in the memory with other images of skies\". More to the point, he suggests that Constable's meteoric advance in meteorological accuracy was a product of his experiments with a camera obscura. </p> <p>The camera obscura involves the use of a lens to project an image on to a screen, which can swiftly be traced with a pencil or brush. \"The sky is the easiest thing to project on to a flat surface,\" argues Hockney, \"and in this way it is possible to capture even rapidly moving clouds, since in the projection they move slower and are subtler in tone.\" Anyone with a shaving mirror can witness this for themselves. </p> <p>Hockney claims to have made this discovery after studying the pencil miniatures produced by Ingres in the mid-19th century. He became convinced that their unerring, fluent execution could only have been made possible by the use of a camera lucida - a direct descendant of the bulkier camera obscura. It is essentially a prism on a stick that can be used to beam an image on to paper. </p> <p>Hockney used the technique in his portraits for the recent Encounters exhibition at the National Gallery in London. The experience confirmed his belief that it was the introduction of lenses and optical aids - precision instruments brought into being by the development of the Venetian glass industry - that was directly responsible for the huge leaps in naturalistic representation during the Renaissance. \"People have been looking through 'cameras' and at projected images for a long, long time and art history has ignored it,\" Hockney claims. \"So I decided to look into it.\" </p> <p>Camera obscuras and other artistic convenience tools have been around for a long time, but experts have been slow to acknowledge their existence, perhaps for fear that anything that reveals the mystery of the artist's sleight of hand could put them out of business. The principles of the camera obscura were known to Aristotle, however, and medieval astronomers used it to observe eclipses. </p> <p>Perhaps it is not surprising that it was the intellectuals of 15th-century Florence who first devised an optical aid for artists. Giorgio Vasari records in his Lives of the Artists that Leon Battista Alberti began tracing perspective and the diminution of figures in 1457 \"by means of an instrument\" but explains only that it was \"ingenious, useful to art and very beautiful\". Meanwhile, Filippo Brunelleschi produced a piece of optical trickery based on his newly devised method of calculating perspective. A contemporary records how Brunelleschi used a complex interaction of pinprick, vanishing point and mirror to convince people that a painting was in fact an actual cityscape. </p> <p>After this discovery, a variety of aids became available to simplify the calculation of perspective. One of the most common was the squared glass frame, recommended by Albrecht D\u00fcrer in a treatise published in 1525, which includes a woodcut of the artist composing a portrait by peering at his subject through a table-mounted eyepiece and screen. </p> <p>The first written account of a camera obscura comes from a Naples physician, Giambattista della Porta, whose description of the process in 1558 first brought the method to wider attention. In 1679 the English architect and scientist Robert Hooke built a portable apparatus for landscape painters, and by the 18th cen tury it was something of a craze for topographical painters including Canaletto, some of whom would sit for hours in darkened cabinets resembling a cross between a sedan chair and a photo booth. </p> <p>However, it was the introduction of a lens to these contraptions that heralded the leap in perception that Hockney claims to have identified. In the early 17th century the English author John Bate placed a concave lens before a squared frame, creating an extended field of vision with a fish-eye distortion. That Dutch artists were excited by these developments seems to be clear from the skewed, elongated plane of Carel Fabritius's View of Delft in the National Gallery. </p> <p>Here one can also find the finest extant example of the work of another of Rembrandt's former pupils, Samuel von Hoogstraten, master of the Dutch phenomenon of the peep-show perspective box. Plato was the first to condemn the use of perspective as fraudulent, and even Hoogstraten agreed. \"Painting,\" he wrote, \"is a science that represents all ideas or notions that the visible world can give, and deceives the eye with outlines and colours.\" </p> <p>Where Hockney and his critics disagree is in the nature of the deception. Academics write volumes about the illusory aspects of art, yet the suggestion that the blurred highlights and distortions of Vermeer's work might have been inspired by their appearance in a camera obscura fills them with horror. </p> <p>But need the use of lenses be such a cloak-and-dagger business? Perhaps Hockney's most controversial sugges-tion - that Caravaggio worked furt-ively in darkened rooms with a secret lens - rather overplays the melodrama of his startling \"discovery\". </p> <p>And to what extent is it really a discovery at all? Over 30 years ago Kenneth Clark suggested that Vermeer worked with a lens and a ground-glass screen. And why wouldn't he? He was working in a climate where the greatest philosopher in the Netherlands, Spinoza, also happened to be the finest lens-maker in Europe. Artists use whatever technology is available to them. Eventually they abandoned the lens to the photographers and moved on to other things. Hockney himself makes art using fax machines.

      "byline": "Sue Lees",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Resisting rape, according to an article in this month's Cosmopolitan, is worthwhile and does not lead to further injury. The article cites a US study of 1.5m rape convictions over a decade which found that women who fought back tripled their chances of escape. How on earth this was calculated is not disclosed. One wonders whether resisting also trebled the chances of being killed. An analysis of the homicide statistics might be helpful here.</p> <p>Crime prevention is all the rage at present and Scott Lindquist, author of The Date Rape Prevention Book (Sourcebooks, \u00a310.99), prescribes the perfect no-cost strategy: women should defend themselves. He tells women to \"outsmart\" their attacker, to \"take a risk and fight him off\", to \"trust your instincts - if one tactic isn't working, try another\".</p> <p>\"Make the most of the first precious minutes,\" he advises. \"At this time the rapist isn't in total control, so your chances are highest.\" The problem is that you won't be in control, either: studies of both men and women who are attacked show they are often \"frozen\" in the first few minutes and cannot then resist.</p> <p>Other advice is equally simplistic. Call the police and a trusted friend who can be with you immediately. However distressed you are, don't have a bath. Call Rape Crisis. Such advice is all very well, but not very helpful. Calling Rape Crisis is unlikely to get a response when few services are funded sufficiently to be on call more than a few hours a day and many women do not feel up to speaking about the assault to anyone, let alone the police.</p> <p>Generalising about resistance is also dangerous and distorting. It can be successful but it can also be life-threatening. In the 100 cases I studied for my book, Carnal Knowledge, I discovered that where women failed to escape, resistance often led to an escalation of violence, so could sometimes be a risky strategy. In such circumstances, surviving is more important than avoiding rape.</p> <p>Such prescriptions also reinforce a common myth: that most rapes are by strangers.

      "bodyText": "Resisting rape, according to an article in this month's Cosmopolitan, is worthwhile and does not lead to further injury. The article cites a US study of 1.5m rape convictions over a decade which found that women who fought back tripled their chances of escape. How on earth this was calculated is not disclosed. One wonders whether resisting also trebled the chances of being killed. An analysis of the homicide statistics might be helpful here. Crime prevention is all the rage at present and Scott Lindquist, author of The Date Rape Prevention Book (Sourcebooks, \u00a310.99), prescribes the perfect no-cost strategy: women should defend themselves. He tells women to \"outsmart\" their attacker, to \"take a risk and fight him off\", to \"trust your instincts - if one tactic isn't working, try another\". \"Make the most of the first precious minutes,\" he advises. \"At this time the rapist isn't in total control, so your chances are highest.\" The problem is that you won't be in control, either: studies of both men and women who are attacked show they are often \"frozen\" in the first few minutes and cannot then resist. Other advice is equally simplistic. Call the police and a trusted friend who can be with you immediately. However distressed you are, don't have a bath. Call Rape Crisis. Such advice is all very well, but not very helpful. Calling Rape Crisis is unlikely to get a response when few services are funded sufficiently to be on call more than a few hours a day and many women do not feel up to speaking about the assault to anyone, let alone the police. Generalising about resistance is also dangerous and distorting. It can be successful but it can also be life-threatening. In the 100 cases I studied for my book, Carnal Knowledge, I discovered that where women failed to escape, resistance often led to an escalation of violence, so could sometimes be a risky strategy. In such circumstances, surviving is more important than avoiding rape. Such prescriptions also reinforce a common myth: that most rapes are by strangers. All the case studies quoted in Cosmopolitan involved such attacks - including a victim of the serial rapist Clive Barwell, who is said to have fought so hard that he ran off. Yet according to the most recent Home Office report, published last year, only 12% of reported rapes are by strangers; the other 88% are by acquaintances or partners which can make avoiding rape even more problematic.

Some of its objectives were quite progressive.

      "bodyText": "Fuad Sirageddin, who has died aged 89, epitomised the landed aristocracy of the old order of Egypt that was swept away by the young army officers revolt of July 1952. The last surviving pasha - the highest title after the monarch - he was overweight, cigar and water-pipe smoking and had little or no patience with commoners. He remained in politics all his life, but his world was shattered when those officers, of poor or fellahin background, dissolved political parties, deposed the king, abolished all titles - including pasha - confiscated the land, nationalised industries and, in turning Egyptian politics and society upside down, sent reverberations throughout the region. When the coup took place, Sirageddin was deputy leader of the then 30-year-old Wafd party, which had so dominated the scene that in the 1950 elections it fielded 296 candidates and won 226 seats. Some of its objectives were quite progressive. It insisted on national unity between Muslims and Copts, with the slogan \"Religion is for God, the homeland is for all.\" It advocated equal pay for equal work for men and women, full franchise for women and independence of the judiciary. The king was \"to reign; but not rule\", while his power was to derive from parliament not religious authority. Despite confrontation and friction with Britain as the occupying colonial power and over its policies in Palestine and Sudan, the Wafd party supported the allies during the second world war. Sirageddin was born into a land-owning family from Kafr Aggraidah, near Cairo. He graduated in law from Fuad University in 1930. His first job was in the attorney general's office, in 1932. Four years later he joined the Wafd party and in 1942 was appointed minister of agriculture and minister of social affairs, initiating a landmark law for anti-illiteracy in Egypt; in 1946 he was minister of communications. By 1950 he was holder of the finance and interior portfolios: and was clearly earmarked for the leadership of the party. In 1952 he won national acclaim when, as minister of the interior, he supported the Egyptian position in the clash between Egyptian police and a British battalion over a dispute about British access to police premises in Ismailia, the headquarters for the British Suez Canal forces. The occasion is still commemorated as National Police Day in Egypt. Fuad Sirageddin opposed Nasser's policies. He was arrested on charges of opposing the policies of the revolution, tried and sentenced to 15 years in prison (but spent only three years in jail).

He, along with some 30 fellow artists of 15 different nationalities, has taken over a magnificent six-storey edifice on the Rue de Rivoli close to the ultra-chic Place des Vosges.</p> <p>\"We have no place to work, and the city has thousands of empty buildings. This place had been unoccupied for 13 years. Besides which, being in a community like this is inspirational, and gives the public a chance watch us.\"</p> <p>Suspended from the facade of the building, the property of an offshoot of the debt-ridden Credit Lyonnais bank, is a colourful cloth spider's web knitted from garment swatches. Up the stairs are digitally doctored photographs and paint-daubed posters. The walls are graffiti-covered, the bare rooms draped in cloth and dripping with installations.</p> <p>\"This is an alternative artistic community,\" proclaimed Kalex, one of the squat's founders. \"We are Parisian artists, and we demand the right to be able to live and work in our city. Historically, Paris has always been a home to artists, but to work you need a workshop, to get a workshop you need a state certificate, and to get that you need to know people.\"</p> <p>As more and more of the French capital falls prey to creeping gentrification, its traditional Bohemian haunts are being lost.

      "bodyText": "There are maybe a dozen around the city, and their number is growing: unable to afford the airy 19th-century lofts and studios that have become the preferred homes of upwardly mobile 30-somethings, the impoverished artists of Paris are squatting in some of its finest buildings. \"What we're doing is essential,\" insisted Francesco, 30, a particularly exuberant painter. He, along with some 30 fellow artists of 15 different nationalities, has taken over a magnificent six-storey edifice on the Rue de Rivoli close to the ultra-chic Place des Vosges. \"We have no place to work, and the city has thousands of empty buildings. This place had been unoccupied for 13 years. Besides which, being in a community like this is inspirational, and gives the public a chance watch us.\" Suspended from the facade of the building, the property of an offshoot of the debt-ridden Credit Lyonnais bank, is a colourful cloth spider's web knitted from garment swatches. Up the stairs are digitally doctored photographs and paint-daubed posters. The walls are graffiti-covered, the bare rooms draped in cloth and dripping with installations. \"This is an alternative artistic community,\" proclaimed Kalex, one of the squat's founders. \"We are Parisian artists, and we demand the right to be able to live and work in our city. Historically, Paris has always been a home to artists, but to work you need a workshop, to get a workshop you need a state certificate, and to get that you need to know people.\" As more and more of the French capital falls prey to creeping gentrification, its traditional Bohemian haunts are being lost. The damage is worst in St Germain-des-Pr\u00e8s, where Emporio Armani has taken over the old Drugstore cafe, Dior inhabits the mythical Le Divan bookshop, and Cartier rings and bracelets are on display where once there was a classical-record shop. Rich young professionals in search of out-of-the-ordinary accommodation have also begun infiltrating Paris' cit\u00e9s des artistes: striking council-owned complexes of low-rent studios with high windows in places such as Montmartre and Montparnasse. \"Even if I could afford \u00a3600 or \u00a3800 a month for an atelier, no agent would accept me because my income is so precarious,\" said an artist known as Chauchat. Standing in front of one of his oeuvres - a bicycle attached by a complicated system of wires and pulleys to a doll that dances when the pedals turn - he said squatters \"have to break the law so the law will evolve\". Fernando, 30, a trompe-l'oeil specialist and one of 400 renegade artists who launched the squatters movement by temporarily taking over 15,000 square yards of an abandoned secondary school, agreed. \"This whole thing is taking off so successfully, we've started to believe in what was only a dream,\" he said. \"Once you squat, it's possible to live from and for your art. In places like this, surrounded by like-minded artists, you really develop. Squatting makes art possible for artists, and for people.\" At Paris town hall they are not quite so sure. \"It may be art, but that's not what most people would call it,\" sniffed a buildings inspector. \"They splash so much paint on the facades you have to sand down the stone to get rid of it, and no sooner have you finished than they've moved in somewhere else. These people need to learn respect for their artistic heritage.\" That, says Fernando, is what they said of Monet, Lautrec and van Gogh. \"The council?\" he said, cryptically. \"I hate straight lines. They're so negative.\" \u0095 Additional reporting by Elodie Ratsimbazafy",

His novel, Le Roi Ren\u00e9 (1976), was about Ren\u00e9 Vietto, the 1930s Tour champion, and in 1987 he wrote an account of his own experiences of cycling the same 4,813 kilometres as the Italian champion Fausto Coppi, the ciampanissimo who had won the race in 1949.</p> <p>He wrote 17 novels; his first, published in 1970, was prefaced by the writer who became his master, Joseph Kessel. Bicycles aside, he wrote about the poor, immigrants, his family, cats - and about friendship, a favourite theme. Young people, he observed, had nothing to exchange with others, except their mobile phone numbers. He remembered better times.</p> <p>A sign of Nucera's preferences was the importance of the names that he gave to both cats and bicycles. He aimed to cycle 100 kilometres a day, and knew something of the emotions that the prospect of the long and punishing climb of the \"giant of Provence\", Mont Ventoux, inspired. As a novelist he expressed those emotions without flinching from dramatic language. Yet Nucera never raced. He claimed that he would come last, or he would be among those identified by commentators as \"etcetera, etcetera\".</p> <p>He was born in Nice, the son of poor Italian immigrants. His father, a plumber, died young, while his mother knitted for a living. When he passed his certificat d'\u00e9tudes, she embraced him. \"Now I know,\" she said, \"that you won't starve to death.\"</p> <p>He was soon promoted from odd jobs in a bank and there he met his first writers, Henry Miller and Roger Martin du Gard. In 1959, he became a reporter on the Communist daily, Patriote. Scouring Nice for stories, he demonstrated his real gift, making and keeping friends.</p> <p>From 1964 to 1973 he worked in Paris as a Philips Records public relations manager.

      "bodyText": "The novelist Louis Nucera, who has been killed in a cycling accident outside Nice aged 72, was a devotee of the bicycle and of the Tour de France. His novel, Le Roi Ren\u00e9 (1976), was about Ren\u00e9 Vietto, the 1930s Tour champion, and in 1987 he wrote an account of his own experiences of cycling the same 4,813 kilometres as the Italian champion Fausto Coppi, the ciampanissimo who had won the race in 1949. He wrote 17 novels; his first, published in 1970, was prefaced by the writer who became his master, Joseph Kessel. Bicycles aside, he wrote about the poor, immigrants, his family, cats - and about friendship, a favourite theme. Young people, he observed, had nothing to exchange with others, except their mobile phone numbers. He remembered better times. A sign of Nucera's preferences was the importance of the names that he gave to both cats and bicycles. He aimed to cycle 100 kilometres a day, and knew something of the emotions that the prospect of the long and punishing climb of the \"giant of Provence\", Mont Ventoux, inspired. As a novelist he expressed those emotions without flinching from dramatic language. Yet Nucera never raced. He claimed that he would come last, or he would be among those identified by commentators as \"etcetera, etcetera\". He was born in Nice, the son of poor Italian immigrants. His father, a plumber, died young, while his mother knitted for a living. When he passed his certificat d'\u00e9tudes, she embraced him. \"Now I know,\" she said, \"that you won't starve to death.\" He was soon promoted from odd jobs in a bank and there he met his first writers, Henry Miller and Roger Martin du Gard. In 1959, he became a reporter on the Communist daily, Patriote. Scouring Nice for stories, he demonstrated his real gift, making and keeping friends. From 1964 to 1973 he worked in Paris as a Philips Records public relations manager. He helped to launch France's rock 'n' roller Johnny Halliday, and started a lasting friendship with Georges Brassens. Thirteen years at a publishers followed. His writings won him many prizes, including the Grand Prix de l'Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in 1993. But he never forgot his early poverty. On the day of his death he had left Nice and was heading for open country when, as he turned left, he was knocked down and killed by an overtaking car. In that city everyone was his friend, rich and powerful, poor and lonely. \u0095 Louis Nucera, writer, born July 17 1928; died August 9 2000",

      "bodyText": "The introduction of strong measures against harassment of people involved with animal research (Change of tack on animal militants, August 15) has implications not only for research organisations and their staff but for everyone who wants to see the advent of new medicines and other treatments to help people with life-threatening diseases and debilitating medical conditions. The UK has traditionally been a strong innovator in medical science and animal research is an essential part of this. If UK medical researchers, the organisations they work for and shareholders in medical science companies are not safeguarded from harassment by animal activists, the UK cannot expect to retain its position at the leading edge of medicine. Dr Jeff Kipling Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry \u0095 All medical discoveries of the past century are the result of trial-and-error using human patients. For example, following hundreds of successful heart transplants on animals, the first human patient died. Over the following year, a hundred more human heart transplants were performed and not a single patient survived. It took another 10 years of trial-and- error before the difficulties were overcome. Professor George Radda's claim (Letters, August 12) that experiments on genetically engineered mice may produce \"cures\" for human diseases is fantasy. Professor Richard Klausner, head of the National Cancer Institute in the US, admits: \"We have cured mice of cancer for decades, but it simply didn't work in humans.\" MA Thompson Hucknall, Notts",

Perhaps he would like to supply his versions of the following: a human embryo is not fully human because it lacks intelligence/is not complete or properly developed/is inferior in kind/etc.</p> <p>Now if you replace human embryo with the word woman or disabled person, or black person or whoever else is considered only \"potentially\" fully human, maybe (from a historical perspective) you can understand the gigantic error.<br> <b>Dr Stefan Hawlin</b><br> Oxford</p> <p>\u0095 Patients and carers groups like Spring welcome the publication of the Donaldson report and the favourable response by the government to it. For incurable diseases like Parkinson's, the report opens up the possibility of novel treatments and a possible cure. Those who may oppose this development need to show good reason why people with chronic illnesses should be denied advances in medical treatments that would substantially improve their quality of life. Abstract arguments carry little weight with those whose daily lives are dominated by the struggle to cope with crippling conditions.<br> <b>Charles A Holme</b><br> Chairman, Spring</p> <p>\u0095 Action Research - one of the UK's leading medical research charities - welcomes the announcement of a free vote by MPs on the \"relaxing\" of the law regarding cloning for medical research. Whilst research using human embryos falls outside the charity's remit, we appreciate how important cloning of specific human cells is to the future of medical research.<br> <b>Duncan Barkes</b><br> Action Research<br> DBarkes@actionresearch.co.uk</p> <p>\u0095 Philosophically speaking, the human embryo can be characterised as a human being, albeit at a very early stage of development, since it requires nothing but the right environment to develop to adulthood.

      "bodyText": "In his defence of experimentation on human embryos, Ian Gibson (A Vote for Cloning, August 15) takes a long time to come to the nub of the matter: what exactly is the status of an embryo? Perhaps he would like to supply his versions of the following: a human embryo is not fully human because it lacks intelligence/is not complete or properly developed/is inferior in kind/etc. Now if you replace human embryo with the word woman or disabled person, or black person or whoever else is considered only \"potentially\" fully human, maybe (from a historical perspective) you can understand the gigantic error. Dr Stefan Hawlin Oxford \u0095 Patients and carers groups like Spring welcome the publication of the Donaldson report and the favourable response by the government to it. For incurable diseases like Parkinson's, the report opens up the possibility of novel treatments and a possible cure. Those who may oppose this development need to show good reason why people with chronic illnesses should be denied advances in medical treatments that would substantially improve their quality of life. Abstract arguments carry little weight with those whose daily lives are dominated by the struggle to cope with crippling conditions. Charles A Holme Chairman, Spring \u0095 Action Research - one of the UK's leading medical research charities - welcomes the announcement of a free vote by MPs on the \"relaxing\" of the law regarding cloning for medical research. Whilst research using human embryos falls outside the charity's remit, we appreciate how important cloning of specific human cells is to the future of medical research. Duncan Barkes Action Research DBarkes@actionresearch.co.uk \u0095 Philosophically speaking, the human embryo can be characterised as a human being, albeit at a very early stage of development, since it requires nothing but the right environment to develop to adulthood. Contrary to Ian Gibson's claim, no such continuum extends to the sperm and unfertilised egg. It is easy to characterise one's opponents as reactionary, but the idea that human beings have intrinsic value is one of the foundations of our civilisation. Many movements in history sought to undermine this and have also claimed to act in the name of reason and progress. Dr Andrew Pinsent Sunningdale, Berks Itautec@compuserve.com \u0095 Regarding the Roslin Institute's decision to end pig transplant research, Dr Grahame Bulfield, its director, swiftly undermined the implications of Professor Wilmut's statement that \"it's possible there could be viruses we don't know about that could be released into the human population\" (Gene fears end pig testing, August 14). He claims that the programme may be ended for \"purely commercial\" reasons. True. The lawsuits which might arise should an Aids-like virus be passed from pigs to humans as a result of their research, or any medical procedure derived from it, could quite easily ruin the bio-tech industry. Two issues give rise to disquiet: that \"commercial\" reasons are the consideration, rather than the concerns of Professor Wilmut about medical risks; and Dr Bulfield's belief that \"other centres might be better equipped to pursue xenotransplantation research\".

      "bodyText": "The Taliban regime in Afghanistan is making an unlikely attempt to send a team to next month's Sydney Olympics, but women will not be allowed to compete and male athletes will be forbidden to shave off their obligatory beards. Although there are few sports facilities left in the country, which has been devastated by 20 years of war, Afghans take pride in their tough boxers and wrestlers, who have won Olympic medals and competed in other international events in the past. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) suspended Afghanistan last year, ruling that the Taliban have no control of sport in the country. Although the regime controls most of Afghanistan, it is not recognised by the UN. \"Our players have prepared for years for this, but now they are being denied participation in the Olympics,\" the sports minister, Shakoor Muttmain, said. He said it would be the first time since 1936 that an Afghan team had failed to compete at a summer Olympics. The Taliban, who swept to power shortly after the Atlanta games four years ago, have asked the IOC to let them send a team to Sydney. \"We know that it is at the behest of the United States that we are being kept out of the Olympics,\" Mr Shakoor said. Washington has warned that it is considering toughening its sanctions against the Taliban for refusing to hand over Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire it accuses of bombing two of its embassies in east Africa two years ago. More than 200 people were killed. The Taliban include sport in their tough interpretation of Islamic law: sportsmen are not allowed to wear short-sleeved shirts and shorts and may be beaten by the religious police if they trim their beards. Two years ago three Afghan boxers were banned from a competition in Karachi, Pakistan, because they would not cut their beards to meet international boxing rules. They said they feared severe retribution if they returned home clean-shaven. Spectators cannot clap or cheer at sports matches in Afghanistan and may only show their approval by shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is great). Kabul's football stadium is regularly used for public executions. The ousted Afghan government, which is still fighting a civil war against the Islamic regime, said the Taliban were trying to hijack the Olympic cause to court international diplomatic recognition. Only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates recognise the Taliban. \"The Taliban are facing political isolation worldwide and have seen the Olympic games as yet another opportunity . . . to seek world recognition,\" said Mahmoud Saikal, the former government's consul general in Canberra, Australia. His government, which still holds the UN seat for Afghanistan, hoped to enter a team of men and women in the games, he said.",

The foreign ministry, which has repeatedly denied that it would pay a ransom or deal with the rebels, refused to comment on the report, which echoes a German press report that Col Gadafy had paid $25m (\u00a316.6m) ransom for the freedom of the Abu Sayyaf group's remaining hostages. A Lebanese minister Suleiman Traboulsi, said yesterday that the Lebanese-born Marie Moarbes would probably be released from captivity on the island of Jolo in the next 24 hours, Libya's former ambassador to the Philippines, Rahab Assurak, played a key role in the negotiations, and Mr Traboulsi praised Libya's efforts. \"Many European, Arab and Islamic countries tried to help in the release, but it seems that it was the Libyans who got results,\" he said.

Their discovery will add to pressure on governments to implement international agreements to reduce the greenhouse gases that fuel global warming. The news comes hard on a report from the University of Colorado that Arctic temperatures are at their warmest for at least 400 years. </p> <p>Paul Pearson of the University of Bristol and Martin Palmer of Imperial College, London, report in Nature today that they used the evidence of plankton shells drilled from the seabed to estimate the acidity of the sea water over a span of time back almost to the era of the dinosaurs. Carbon dioxide dissolves in water to form a weak carbonic acid. They reasoned that the tissue of floating organisms would reflect the carbon dioxide levels of the world around them - and then hold that record locked in the fossilised shells. </p> <p>Other studies of more recent records have confirmed a picture of a rapid warming in the past two decades.

      "bodyText": "Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at their highest for 20m years, two British scientists reveal today. The two men analysed the shells of tiny ocean creatures to build up a fossil record of the chemistry of the atmosphere for the past 60m years. Their discovery will add to pressure on governments to implement international agreements to reduce the greenhouse gases that fuel global warming. The news comes hard on a report from the University of Colorado that Arctic temperatures are at their warmest for at least 400 years. Paul Pearson of the University of Bristol and Martin Palmer of Imperial College, London, report in Nature today that they used the evidence of plankton shells drilled from the seabed to estimate the acidity of the sea water over a span of time back almost to the era of the dinosaurs. Carbon dioxide dissolves in water to form a weak carbonic acid. They reasoned that the tissue of floating organisms would reflect the carbon dioxide levels of the world around them - and then hold that record locked in the fossilised shells. Other studies of more recent records have confirmed a picture of a rapid warming in the past two decades. Winter is in retreat. The growing season in Europe is 11 days longer than it was 35 years ago. Sea levels have crept higher throughout the century. Six of the 10 warmest years ever recorded occurred in the 1990s; the other four all happened in the late 1980s.

The official death toll stands at nearly 18,000, but unofficial estimates from non-government organisations and local people are significantly higher.</p> <p>Everyone is still struggling to come to terms with the scale of the destruction and loss of life. Nearly 200,000 people are still living in temporary prefabricated huts or tents, while tens of thousands have left the area altogether.</p> <p>Alongside the main road through Golcuk, dozens of badly damaged buildings remain abandoned. The side streets are littered with empty plots where rows of multi-storey housing blocks crumbled to the ground in a few seconds.</p> <p>\"We don't need an anniversary to remind us,\" Sevgi Aktas said as she sat on a makeshift bench at the side of the road.</p> <p>\"The memories are everywhere. They confront us every day.\"</p> <p>One year on, many people wonder how many lessons have been learned from the tragedy, and how much better prepared Turkey will be when the next earthquake comes.</p> <p>There are some encouraging signs. Thousands of people have been trained in the basics of earthquake rescue, and teams of civil-defence volunteers are being set up in every district. Ordinary citizens, horrified by how little official help was available a year ago, want to be ready to make their own contribution next time.</p> <p>The state has also revamped its disaster-management programme: the response to a second big earthquake which struck the same region in November last year was much more efficient. It is still a highly centralised system and by no means perfect, but it is better than it was.</p> <p>Educational programmes have begun with books and videos about earthquakes and their consequences being distributed to schools.</p> <p>\"We have to teach people to live sensibly with a constant threat,\" said a leading earthquake expert, Ahmet Mete Isikara. \"At least we've been shaken out of our complacency now, and we have made a start.\"</p> <p>Government promises to complete the rebuilding process by the end of this year are not going to be met, however: the old town centres still look as if they are recovering from a war.</p> <p>Thick clouds of dust billow along half-paved streets, and many water and sewerage systems have not yet been repaired. On Golcuk's fractured seafront a line of lamp-posts disappears under the water, and the waves lap gently into the half-submerged remains of deserted buildings.</p> <p>Locally elected officials complain that they have not received enough help, or even the right kind of help, from the central government. They want more good land to satisfy the demand for safe housing, and more financial assistance to get the economy back on its feet.</p> <p>\"We're still living in a state of chaos,\" admitted the mayor of Golcuk, Ismail Baris. \"None of our long-term needs has been properly met.\"</p> <p>The real anger, however, is reserved for the corrupt contractors and local bureaucrats who allowed so many sub-standard buildings to be built. Countless lives were lost because of those acts of negligence - and it could well happen again.</p> <p>The Turkish chamber of commerce estimates that about two-thirds of the country's buildings were erected without proper permits and with little attention to their safety. In one of the most geologically unstable regions in the world, that is a recipe for further tragedy.</p> <p>The next big earthquake could be decades away, or it could happen in a matter of months. Scientists admit that it is impossible to predict.</p> <p>The most acute fear is that Istanbul, a largely unprepared, sprawling metropolis of about 12m people, could be much closer to the epicentre next time.</p> <p>In his office at the Kandilli observatory overlooking the Bosporus, Mr Isikara is under no illusion about the size of the challenge that lies ahead. \"We have to guard against short memories and easy solutions,\" he said slowly, emphasising every word.</p> <p>\"We don't know how long we have to get it right.\"</p> <p><b>Counting the cost</b></p> <p>\u0095 The official death toll stands at 17,840, but there are no reliable figures for the number of people missing or unaccounted for</p> <p>\u0095 The authorities say 88% of the badly damaged buildings have been demolished. More than 1,100 are still standing.

      "bodyText": "One year after thousands of people were killed when a huge earthquake struck north-western Turkey, not a single person has been made to pay for the breaches of building regulations which resulted in so many buildings collapsing. Thousands of claims for compensation have been made, and thousands of criminal investigations have begun, but no cases have been settled and no one has been charged. In fact, some of the big construction companies whose substandard buildings collapsed during the earthquake have won contracts to take part in the rebuilding programme. \"There may be a few scapegoats, but the big boys won't be punished,\" a man in the town of Golcuk said bitterly. \"They never are.\" That sense of anger will be apparent as solemn ceremonies take place throughout the region today to remember those who died so suddenly when one of the strongest earthquakes of the 20th century struck with devastating consequences in the middle of the night. Vigils have been organised for 3.02am local time, the exact moment that the earthquake ripped through Turkey's heavily populated industrial heartland. The official death toll stands at nearly 18,000, but unofficial estimates from non-government organisations and local people are significantly higher. Everyone is still struggling to come to terms with the scale of the destruction and loss of life. Nearly 200,000 people are still living in temporary prefabricated huts or tents, while tens of thousands have left the area altogether. Alongside the main road through Golcuk, dozens of badly damaged buildings remain abandoned. The side streets are littered with empty plots where rows of multi-storey housing blocks crumbled to the ground in a few seconds. \"We don't need an anniversary to remind us,\" Sevgi Aktas said as she sat on a makeshift bench at the side of the road. \"The memories are everywhere. They confront us every day.\" One year on, many people wonder how many lessons have been learned from the tragedy, and how much better prepared Turkey will be when the next earthquake comes. There are some encouraging signs. Thousands of people have been trained in the basics of earthquake rescue, and teams of civil-defence volunteers are being set up in every district. Ordinary citizens, horrified by how little official help was available a year ago, want to be ready to make their own contribution next time. The state has also revamped its disaster-management programme: the response to a second big earthquake which struck the same region in November last year was much more efficient. It is still a highly centralised system and by no means perfect, but it is better than it was. Educational programmes have begun with books and videos about earthquakes and their consequences being distributed to schools. \"We have to teach people to live sensibly with a constant threat,\" said a leading earthquake expert, Ahmet Mete Isikara. \"At least we've been shaken out of our complacency now, and we have made a start.\" Government promises to complete the rebuilding process by the end of this year are not going to be met, however: the old town centres still look as if they are recovering from a war. Thick clouds of dust billow along half-paved streets, and many water and sewerage systems have not yet been repaired. On Golcuk's fractured seafront a line of lamp-posts disappears under the water, and the waves lap gently into the half-submerged remains of deserted buildings. Locally elected officials complain that they have not received enough help, or even the right kind of help, from the central government. They want more good land to satisfy the demand for safe housing, and more financial assistance to get the economy back on its feet. \"We're still living in a state of chaos,\" admitted the mayor of Golcuk, Ismail Baris. \"None of our long-term needs has been properly met.\" The real anger, however, is reserved for the corrupt contractors and local bureaucrats who allowed so many sub-standard buildings to be built. Countless lives were lost because of those acts of negligence - and it could well happen again. The Turkish chamber of commerce estimates that about two-thirds of the country's buildings were erected without proper permits and with little attention to their safety. In one of the most geologically unstable regions in the world, that is a recipe for further tragedy. The next big earthquake could be decades away, or it could happen in a matter of months. Scientists admit that it is impossible to predict. The most acute fear is that Istanbul, a largely unprepared, sprawling metropolis of about 12m people, could be much closer to the epicentre next time. In his office at the Kandilli observatory overlooking the Bosporus, Mr Isikara is under no illusion about the size of the challenge that lies ahead. \"We have to guard against short memories and easy solutions,\" he said slowly, emphasising every word. \"We don't know how long we have to get it right.\" Counting the cost \u0095 The official death toll stands at 17,840, but there are no reliable figures for the number of people missing or unaccounted for \u0095 The authorities say 88% of the badly damaged buildings have been demolished. More than 1,100 are still standing. Thousands of moderately damaged buildings remain uninhabitable \u0095 More than 42,000 new houses are being built, funded by the Turkish authorities and the World Bank. Some of them will be completed by the end of this year, others will be available for occupation next spring \u0095 Nearly 150,000 people are still living in prefabricated huts, and more than 30,000 are still living in tents \u0095 More than 6,500 criminal investigations and compensation claims have been launched in the courts. None has so far been settled \u0095 The chamber of industries in Izmit, northern Turkey, estimates that the financial cost of the earthquake was more than \u00a36bn in damage and lost production",

But however bad it was, Parasite Eve II cannot possibly be an improvement. </p> <p>You play Aya Brea, an agent for MIST, the Mitochondria Investigation and Suppression Team. The FBI has an entire department dedicated to exterminating bugs. </p> <p>That's right, the FBI has an entire department dedicated to exterminating bugs (although technically, a mitochondrion is not a creature at all but a constituent of a cell). Bizarre names, abstruse organisations, disregard for basic science - if you hadn't already guessed this was from the makers of Final Fantasy, now you know. </p> <p>It's just as well the FBI is so foresighted, because a swarm of overgrown creepy-crawlies has just infested a building in Los Angeles. And it's MIST's job to splat them. </p> <p>PEII is a \"cinematic adventure\", which translates into a scrolling third-person display reminiscent of Resident Evil and detailed but oddly dull graphics. </p> <p>Points are everything: HP (health points), MP (mitochondria points), and the experience points you earn after defeating each enemy. </p> <p>This is all accessed through a convoluted (and, in the heat of battle, deeply unrealistic) menu system. But whereas FF was largely about magic, the main concern here is firepower. </p> <p>Dozens of weapons are available in the game, many of which can be combined for even more lethal effect: Magnum, machine gun, flame-thrower, etc (disappointingly, giant cans of Raid and outsized magnifying glasses are not among them). </p> <p>By all rights, bug-busting ought to be fun. But with its drab visuals, infuriating controls (no run button?) and logic-defying plot, Parasite Eve II is as enjoyable as dipping your face in a barrel full of live cockroaches. Me, I'm sticking to beetle drives. (AB)</p> <p> <strong> Dark, dark times in Europe </strong></p> <p><strong>Arcatera: The Dark Brotherhood</strong><br> Ubisoft \u00a329.99 PC CD Rom *<br> We enjoy their wine, climate and culture but one thing we Brits can't digest is the European love for point-'n'-click games. And that's not the fault of the genre. The seminal Monkey Island series, and titles like Grim Fandango, offered some of the best game experiences around. This was down to their humorous scripts and user-friendly interfaces - neither of which applies to Arcatera: The Dark Brotherhood. </p> <p>In fact it's almost as if the developers had deliberately decided to ignore everything that worked so well in Monkey Island and the rest. So we get laughable dialogue, complete with subtitles that often bear little relation to what is being said. We also get character accents that are unintentionally hilarious. The female lead sounds like a 19th Century West Country milkmaid. </p> <p>Even worse is the way you interact with your surroundings.

      "bodyText": "Killing bugs has never been so dull Parasite Eve II Square \u00a329.99 Sony PlayStation * I'd never even heard of Parasite Eve I, much less played it. But however bad it was, Parasite Eve II cannot possibly be an improvement. You play Aya Brea, an agent for MIST, the Mitochondria Investigation and Suppression Team. The FBI has an entire department dedicated to exterminating bugs. That's right, the FBI has an entire department dedicated to exterminating bugs (although technically, a mitochondrion is not a creature at all but a constituent of a cell). Bizarre names, abstruse organisations, disregard for basic science - if you hadn't already guessed this was from the makers of Final Fantasy, now you know. It's just as well the FBI is so foresighted, because a swarm of overgrown creepy-crawlies has just infested a building in Los Angeles. And it's MIST's job to splat them. PEII is a \"cinematic adventure\", which translates into a scrolling third-person display reminiscent of Resident Evil and detailed but oddly dull graphics. Points are everything: HP (health points), MP (mitochondria points), and the experience points you earn after defeating each enemy. This is all accessed through a convoluted (and, in the heat of battle, deeply unrealistic) menu system. But whereas FF was largely about magic, the main concern here is firepower. Dozens of weapons are available in the game, many of which can be combined for even more lethal effect: Magnum, machine gun, flame-thrower, etc (disappointingly, giant cans of Raid and outsized magnifying glasses are not among them). By all rights, bug-busting ought to be fun. But with its drab visuals, infuriating controls (no run button?) and logic-defying plot, Parasite Eve II is as enjoyable as dipping your face in a barrel full of live cockroaches. Me, I'm sticking to beetle drives. (AB) Dark, dark times in Europe Arcatera: The Dark Brotherhood Ubisoft \u00a329.99 PC CD Rom * We enjoy their wine, climate and culture but one thing we Brits can't digest is the European love for point-'n'-click games. And that's not the fault of the genre. The seminal Monkey Island series, and titles like Grim Fandango, offered some of the best game experiences around. This was down to their humorous scripts and user-friendly interfaces - neither of which applies to Arcatera: The Dark Brotherhood. In fact it's almost as if the developers had deliberately decided to ignore everything that worked so well in Monkey Island and the rest. So we get laughable dialogue, complete with subtitles that often bear little relation to what is being said. We also get character accents that are unintentionally hilarious. The female lead sounds like a 19th Century West Country milkmaid. Even worse is the way you interact with your surroundings. Examining a chest takes two mouse clicks and if you want to cast a spell or get into a fight then prepare for excessive appendage motion. And don't even think about being able to navigate easily; the screen exit arrows regularly get hidden behind the stats menu. However, the ability to choose and develop a character, along with the medieval criminal investigations of the plot (complete with time limit), does offer some potential. The game is very easy on the eye, with some practically photo-realistic environments and quality cut-scenes. But beautiful backdrops and a sprinkle of RPG innovation are scant consolation for the game's numerous shortcomings. Arcatera makes aEurosceptic of us all. (GH)",

The VDSL specification, which admittedly is more of a dream than reality at the moment, allows for data rates up to 52Mbps using the same copper wire. See a good FAQ on the subject at: www.orckit.com/orckit_dsl_center.html. In addition, the rather dubious assertion that \"high quality full screen moving images\" requires 30Mbps is clearly wrong. The BBC transmits its channels at a fixed 3.5Mbps over digital TV, and you only need to walk into your nearest TV store to see how good it looks. Matt Pyne matt.p@softsim.co",
