Substitutes: Germano, Marcio, Odvan, Donizete, Torres, Miranda, Pedrinho, Valber, Viola, Oliveira, Nasa, Alex. <br></p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> Manchester United kick off in the game they must win. Phillip Neville covers for the absent David Beckham in midfield. Yorke leads the line and Andy Cole warms the bench next to Beckham, serving his one match suspension. Sir Alex Ferguson watches from the stands. <br><strong>2</strong> First free kick to United on the right. Giggs takes and Roy Keane meets the centre with his head, but the ball balloons harmlessly out of play. Goal kick. <br><strong>5</strong> United are enjoying the lion's share of the possession as Stam and Irwin push well forward in the 34\u00b0C heat. Gary Neville crosses well from the right to Helton's far post, which the Vasco keeper claims well.<br><strong>7</strong> Romario, with his first chance of the game, skins Silvestre for pace and wins a corner from Stam on the left. The set piece is wasted but the Brazilian striker has given the United defenders a taste of what's to come.<br><strong>8</strong> United's first corner, but claimed well by Helton, who throws out quickly to encourage the Rio team to break. An offside decision returns possession to United. <br><strong>10</strong> A mistake by Junior Baiano gifts the ball to Giggs on the left of the Vasco box, but the ball ricochets off the fortunate Baiano and Vasco break with Romario looking to beat the offside trap. He fails, but by the slimmest of margins. <br><strong>14</strong> Vasco are coming into the game more as Edmundo and Romario are constantly looking to catch the United defence square.<br><strong>16</strong> Vasco right-back Jorginho plays an excellent ball 50 yards into the path of the sprinting Romario, but the excellent Stam is equal to the challenge and tidies up. United's conservative 4-5-1 is looking a little blunt, with Yorke cutting a lonely figure up front. <br><strong>19</strong> An uncharacteristically clumsy tackle by Giggs and the Welshman is lucky to avoid a booking.<br><strong>21</strong> Yet again, the linesman comes to United's rescue. Thus far the English team's offside trap has worked well. Gary Neville is felled and requires treatment, and both sides use the break in play to take on fluids.<br><strong>24 Goal: Vasco de Gama</strong> A woefully underhit backpass by Gary Neville is snapped up by Edmundo, who squares to Romario before the advancing Bosnich reaches him. The Brazilian makes no mistake and the capacity Maracana starts celebrating.<br><strong>26 Goal: Vasco de Gama</strong> A nightmare couple of minutes for Gary Neville, who this time chooses a woefully underhit header as his method of self-destruction. Romario cannot believe his luck as he rounds the stranded Bosnich to score once more. The Maracana turns up the volume a notch. Neville's two specials will grace many a sporting blooper video come Christmas.<br> <strong>28</strong> United try to reply from a corner, but Stam cannot make any meaningful contact. Goal kick. <br><strong>32</strong> Ramon finds space on the left, but Stam does enough to wrestle possession from him. United break and Yorke collects on the right, only to be dispossessed. United need to score before the break to prevent this match becoming a procession.<br><strong>34</strong> A corner to United. Stam meets the centre with a flicked header, but his deflection only serves to send the ball out of the danger area. <br><strong>37</strong> Great effort by Giggs who wins possession, loses it and then wins it back again, hitting a 30 yard pass to Keane on the right with the outside of his boot. Keane's centre is scuffed by Solskjaer and Vasco are able to clear. <br><strong>39</strong> A United free kick central to the goal, to be taken by.... Stam? Sure enough, the big Dutchman has a go from fully 30 yards. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the only thing the ball hits is the crowd, after sailing over the running track.<br> <strong>41</strong> Felipe finds a way through the middle and his snap shot is well parried by Bosnich.<br><strong>43 Goal: Vasco de Gama</strong> Collecting a through-ball just in front of the box, Edmundo spins on a sixpence, leaving his marker Silvestre floundering on the ground. Stam races to cover but Edmundo has already lifted the ball over the prostrate Bosnich and is busy pulling his shirt over his head. A very, very bad half for United.<br><strong>47</strong> Half time.<br></p> <p><strong>45 min</strong> Vasco de Gama restart this 'contest'. It may be an overused expression, but United really do need a miracle.<br><strong>45</strong> Substitution: Sheringham for Solskjaer. <br><strong>47</strong> United start brightly. Giggs and Keane find openings and the Vasco defence does well to shut them down. Sheringham tries to lob the Vasco keeper from 20 yards and is unlucky, his effort sailing just wide of Helton's right-hand post. <br><strong>49</strong> Junior Baiano uses his height to cut out a Gary Neville cross. Vasco break from their own penalty area but Giggs intercepts a pass in midfield and breaks down the left. His centre is met by Helton's smothering save, but Sheringham arrives fractionally later and kicks the ball out of his hands and into the net. He is booked for his trouble and will miss the South Melbourne clash. <br><strong>55</strong> A corner to United, who with nothing lose, are proving a handful for Vasco in this second half. Nothing comes of the set piece and Vasco sprint upfield in numbers. Stam halts the Brazilians in their tracks, and United build steadily from the back once more. <br><strong>56</strong> Jorginho pulls off a great tackle to deny Yorke, as his United team-mates appeal for a penalty, Keane takes matters into his won hands and hits a rising, rasping drive from 25 yards that Helton can only deflect for a corner. The centre is poor and the Vasco keeper collects. <br><strong>60</strong> A free kick to United, taken by Sheringham, who hits a powerful drive which is parried for a corner. Again, nothing comes from the set piece, but as Keane and Junior Baiano jostle for position, the Brazilian comes within a foot of the Irishman's elbow and goes down as if gravity had quadrupled for him alone. The referee stops laughing long enough to book him.<br><strong>65</strong> Dwight Yorke, in possession on the left of the Vasco box, squares to a rapidly-advancing Ryan Giggs, who sidefoots the ball precisely over the bar. A frustrating miss for United who need a goal to restore their badly-mauled pride.<br><strong>66</strong> Romario again denied by Stam, who has done very well in dealing with the Vasco forward's pace and movement off the ball.<br><strong>69</strong> Substitution: Paulo Miranda for Jorginho. <br><strong>70</strong> Substitution: Jordi Cruyff for Stam.<br><strong>73</strong> A Giggs cross from the left sails over both sets of players in the box, but Yorke meets it at the far post. He chests is down but drags his shot across the face of the goal.<br><strong>76</strong> Substitution: Nasa for Ramon.<br><strong>77</strong> Substitution: Fortune for Giggs.<br><strong>78</strong> The tempo has dipped and the pace has drained from this game as both sides have accepted their respective fates. <br><strong>79</strong> Substitution: Oliveira for Juninho. <br><strong>81 Goal: Manchester United</strong> A Cruyff free kick from the right is met by Keane at the far post, who squares to Butt on the penalty spot. The United midfielder slots the ball home as all the Vasco players, bar Helton in goal, stand around and watch. <br><strong>85</strong> A touch more urgency in United's approach as they seek another consolation goal. Vasco seem content to let United keep the ball - perhaps conserving their energies for their last two games.<br><strong>87</strong> Good build-up play from United, all wasted by a profligate effort by Butt which clears the crossbar by 10 yards.<br><strong>88</strong> Edmundo and Romario combine well through the middle, and Romario has good cause to be upset with his striking partner as the return pass never comes to the man on the hat-trick. Edmundo's shot blazes wide.<br><strong>89</strong> Three minutes of added pain for United is displayed by the fourth official.<br><strong>92</strong> A surging run by Keane wins a free kick in a central position on the edge of the box from a clumsy challenge by Junior Baiano. A last chance for United to salvage another goal is wasted by Yorke, who shoots high and wide. <br><strong>93</strong> Full time: Manchester United 1 - 3 Vasco de Gama.<br></p>",

Unlike the disenfranchised United fans these are true, if barmy, football supporters. </p> <p>Joe Royle, who in February 1998 became the club's ninth manager in the dozen years that Alex Ferguson had been in situ at Old Trafford, is as perplexed as anyone. </p> <p>\"Frankly, we don't deserve them.

The place is packed out and everyone gets a standing ovation. It was unreal.\" </p> <p>After turning around their league fortunes, Royle is now looking for the sort of Cup success he enjoyed at Oldham, whom he joined in 1982, arriving in a lorry after his car had broken down. Twelve years later he was the longest serving manager in the country. But his challenge at Maine Road more closely resembles that at Everton, where he did not enjoy such success after going there in November 1994. </p> <p>\"When I came here I felt we were a huge tanker going the wrong way. I knew it would take a long time to change direction. Our supporters deserve days like Leeds on Sunday but I will be a lot happier if we pick up three points against Fulham on Sunday week.\" </p> <p>City's prospects tomorrow have not been helped by a virus that swept the club over Christmas. The physio Roy Bailey is still suffering, although Richard Edghill, Tony Grant and the former Leeds full-back Danny Granville should all recover in time. Richard Jobson, another former Leeds defender, will use the occasion to remind his Yorkshire neighbours he is still alive and kicking at 36. The former England B international almost had his career ended by injury during a 2-year spell at Elland Road. </p> <p>Jobson still lives in Halifax and is fed up with hearing Leeds fans asking what he is doing these days. \"It's been a long road back,\" Jobson says. \"I missed the whole of last season and at the back of my mind I was beginning to think about what I was going to do next. But I've surprised a lot of people this season, myself and the manager included.\" </p> <p>It is less than two years since Jobson left Leeds for City but he says the team is unrecognisable since David O'Leary blooded youngsters such as Jonathon Woodgate and Alan Smith. </p> <p>\"I remember Ian Harte and Harry Kewell were just breaking into the first team then as the likes of Jonathon Woodgate were still playing youth-team football.\" </p> <p>Another who will find his allegiances tested is John Bradley, who reports on Leeds matches for Radio Air. </p> <p>\"I'm just praying I don't slip up and let my true colours come out,\" Bradley says. \"I'm already getting terrible stick from the Leeds players and one stole my City lapel badge. </p> <p>\"The best memories for City fans are of standing in the huge terrace of the Kippax before it became a two-tier stand.

Sometimes it is pure farce, at once funny and sad, such as our last game in the Premiership in May 1996.

But suffering moments like that allows us to appreciate days like Sunday.\" </p> <p>The credit for City's revival goes beyond Royle and the players into the boardroom. The former City chairman Peter Swales worked his way through a damaging 11 managers, including Malcolm Allison's two spells, in 20 years; his successor Francis Lee was similarly self-destructive as he got through Brian Horton, Ball, Steve Coppell, the caretaker Phil Neal and Frank Clark, before finally turning to Royle. </p> <p>According to Ian Barton of the Centenary Supporters Association, however, the new, less hands-on chairman David Bernstein has brought stability to Maine Road. </p> <p>\"This club started going wrong when Joe Mercer was kicked upstairs,\" Barton says. \"He was our Bill Shankly.

But, for Lucas Radebe, they are crammed together inside the more crowded space within his own head. </p> <p>\"It's difficult,\" the captain of Leeds United and South Africa says, \"because from the weather to the people, from the culture to the football, nothing is the same. Except for one thing: I now belong to both Soweto and Leeds. They somehow live together in my mind and in my heart.\" </p> <p>Tomorrow night, four hours after he has led Leeds against Manchester City in the tie of the FA Cup's fourth round, Radebe will stretch out in his seat and again think of both his footballing homes as a darkened aircraft races down the runway and climbs into a black sky. He will then have the whole night, 11 hours in all, to consider the impact his ensuing five-week absence might yet have on Leeds's richly promising but recently faltering season. </p> <p>While Radebe and South Africa's cherished national team, Bafana Bafana (The Boys, The Boys), pursue the African Nations Cup in Nigeria, he is likely to miss four games in England which could decide whether his young Leeds side are ready to translate their undoubted potential into trophy-winning reality. </p> <p>Leeds may still head the Premiership and be in contention for both the FA Cup and Uefa Cup, but successive defeats to Arsenal and Aston Villa have reopened doubts about their sustained challenge. The more experienced heavyweight campaigners at Old Trafford and Highbury will have noted Monday's callow performance against Villa at Elland Road when Leeds were given an early and unpalatable taste of life without their captain. </p> <p>Missing the suspended Radebe, their rudderless display suggested that further cracks may emerge during the next month. While he is in Nigeria, Leeds face away matches against Sunderland and Liverpool, followed possibly by a fifth-round FA Cup tie. If South Africa reach the African Nations Cup final on February 13, as they have in their only two previous attempts, Radebe will also miss a home game against Tottenham. </p> <p>\"It's not a good time to be leaving,\" he agrees. \"I would have felt happier, and less guilty about deserting them, if we had got even three points over the new year. We were unlucky David Batty was injured. But other senior pros like David Hopkin and Robert Molenaar are coming back.\" </p> <p>David O'Leary, however, knows how badly Radebe will be missed. \"Lucas is a leader on and off the pitch,\" the manager says. \"Everyone looks up to him. Apart from being a very nice man he's the equal of any defender in this country. He has pace and a great ability to read a game. His distribution is good and his man-marking excellent. There's no one in England I would pick ahead of him.\" </p> <p>His influence on Bafana Bafana is even more celebrated, and his failure to return for the African Nations Cup would have had a shattering affect on their hopes of upsetting Nigeria, still Africa's most accomplished team. </p> <p>\"It's great to be wanted,\" he says, \"but it causes terrible problems. You are torn between two places. If it was only a footballing decision I might have stayed in England. But how could I refuse playing for my country in a tournament as important as the African Nations Cup? Back home it's just as significant as Euro 2000 is here. </p> <p>\"After so many years in the darkness we did incredibly well to win it on our return from isolation in 1996. We then reached the final in '98 while also qualifying for the World Cup. We have to build on that. And I am always conscious of what we went through in South Africa to reach this point.\" </p> <p><strong> Diepkloof memories</strong><br> </p> <p> Although it is a source of some amusement to us, as we grow nostalgic in an empty Portakabin at Leeds's training ground, Radebe and I share a past not only in South Africa but in <strong> </strong> Soweto too. More than 15 years ago, when he was a teenager thirsting for an education and I was a young and hopeless English teacher, we spent time at the same Soweto school in the invigorating but volatile township zone of Diepkloof. </p> <p>My years as the token white guy at Bopasenatla High, or \"Bop\" as Radebe still calls it, are filtered by hazy memories of getting drunk in funky shebeens in between failing to explain the intricacies of Tess Of The D'Urbevilles on steaming township summer days. But for Radebe, who lived with 14 others in a tiny four-room house, there is a darker undertow. </p> <p>\"I always remember those days at Bop High,\" he murmurs, \"because we were desperate to learn and to take what little opportunity apartheid allowed. A lot of our friends fell by the wayside. Students were detained or died in the riots. And, even here in Leeds, I remember the pain. There are people without limbs and people who are crippled. </p> <p>\"I was lucky. I found this football life. So I have to play too for those more talented kids who never had the chance I got.\" </p> <p>Of all of the Soweto memories we hold, both the sweet and the grave, the image of so many astonishingly skilled players juggling a ball on the hard and dusty fields of Diepkloof returns most sharply. While other teachers with names such as Shortie and Moses would reel with delight on the touchline, extravagantly gifted boys from Bop High would make a football bend, curl and almost sing with the pleasure of being struck, even by a split boot or a bare foot. </p> <p>\"It was unbelievable to play with such guys,\" Radebe confirms. \"But we lost so many of them. My older brother was much better than me. But I'm the one who got to Leeds. When I left Soweto six years ago I was very depressed in Leeds. I was so homesick I wanted to give up. But I decided to try harder because I knew that a day gone is a day forgotten. Our time in this game goes very quickly.\" </p> <p>Without Radebe the next five weeks may drag more for Leeds United. Further defeats might ruin their Premiership ambitions even before their captain returns. \"I hope not,\" he stresses, \"because this team has a good chance of doing something this year. If we stay together, who knows what we might achieve?\" </p> <p>Radebe's enduring loyalty to Leeds emerges even more strongly when asked if he would swap African glory for a Premiership title. \"Shoo,\" he yelps, \"how can you ask me that question?\" But after an agonising pause he gives his answer. \"I've played in two African Nations Cup finals and have a winner's medal. So I have to say the Premiership. I would really love to achieve something special in England with Leeds. To win the Premiership would be incredible.\" </p> <p>From tomorrow night until the second Sunday in February, Radebe will first chase his different African dream. But, whether he is in Soweto or Lagos, a part of him will still worry and yearn for his now beloved Leeds. </p> <p>\"I know that wherever I am,\" he says, \"I will have to hunt down a television for coverage of Leeds. It's the same story. When I am here I always think of home; and when I am there I always think of here. It always happens when you belong in more than one place . . .\"</p>",

Indications are that he will be holding court for many years to come. Two weeks and two Tests into his career, he has already taken 13 wickets, been on a hat-trick twice, gone within a whisker of bowling the fastest delivery of the Australian summer, been suspected - and cleared - of having an illegal action, and generally scared the wits out of anyone unfortunate enough to be standing 22 yards away with a bat in his hands. </p> <p>Pakistan's Shoaib Akhtar arrived in October with the cricket world mesmerised by his attempt to break 100mph. But the Rawalpindi Express was soon shunted into a siding and asked to straighten up his faster ball (presumably the one that is a bit faster than his fast ball). Even if his ban is now lifted, the first player to be so punished by the International Cricket Council for throwing may never be the same again. </p> <p>Shoaib's fastest missile of the series, as recorded by the host broadcaster Channel 9, whistled through at 96.4mph. That was on the speed-friendly Waca ground in Perth. Lee, on his debut in Melbourne, where he became the 13th Australian to take a wicket in his first Test over, was clocked at 96.31. With Shoaib in the pits, he is now a clear leader in what Nasser Hussain has dubbed cricket's \"race to go supersonic\". </p> <p>In that shy, retiring Aussie way, Lee had not even been called up for national duty when he was talking up the prospect of bowling faster still. </p> <p>\"As I get bigger and older I am becoming stronger and maturing, and I hope I can gain an extra yard or two over the next two years,\" he said in the week before Christmas, after the eight-wicket haul for New South Wales against Western Australia that led to his elevation. That display prompted Steve Waugh to endorse the 24-year-old as the fastest bowler in the world. </p> <p>Like so many Australians before him, Lee started his career in the family back yard. His father had rolled out a pitch at their Wollongong home, and he had a fair yardstick to bowl to - his older brother Shane, formerly of Somerset and a member of Australia's last two World Cup squads. </p> <p>Three years ago, Lee's current observation that \"to be able to hit batsmen... it's great\" must have seemed like a dream lost, as the curse of fast bowlers, stress fractures of the back, cost him a full season. </p> <p>Dennis Lillee stepped in, turning him front-on at the point of delivery and providing an action that should keep him free of further back trouble, with the bonus of naturally shaping the ball away from right-handers. </p> <p>\"I used to just run in and let go of the ball,\" Lee says. \"Dennis has helped me learn how to be patient, helped me with my technique and also taught me how to think a batsman out.

I see a big future for him.\" </p> <p>Like all good heroes, Lee has his own appeal, and not just the Baywatch looks that were featured in a recent GQ magazine. There is more than a touch of Lillee in the outstretched arms and pleading posture that ques tions the umpire's resolve, to which he has added a furious backpedalling routine that ends with a triumphant faint into the arms of the slips cordon, like a Broadway star as the curtain comes down. </p> <p>Doubtless there will be further scrutiny of Lee's action, an occupational hazard now for anyone who reaches express pace. But perhaps his biggest worry is that Australia's prime minister, John Howard, might be moved to put in his tuppence worth. </p> <p>Having stridently backed the monarchy in the recent republic referendum, further alienating himself from \"young\" Australia, Howard is desperately trying to tap the popular market. In such a golden summer there is nothing more popular than cricket, and so it was that Howard bobbed up behind a radio microphone at the Sydney Cricket Ground last week, lending his support to the embattled Mark Waugh, who continues to tread a thin line towards superannuation. </p> <p>\"I think we're starting to see the old Mark Waugh again,\" Howard noted, after a rare six from the veteran right-hander.

      "body": "<p>\"You see things vacationing on a motorcycle in a way that is completely different from any other. In a car, you're always in a compartment, and because you're used to it you don't realise that through that car window everything you see is just more TV. You're a passive observer and it is all moving by you boringly in a frame. On a cycle the frame is gone. You're completely in contact with it all. You're in the scene, not just watching it anymore, and the sense of presence is overwhelming.\"<br>Robert M Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</p> <p>It had to be a Harley-Davidson. I don't care for them much normally - big, cumbersome, noisy things with all the disadvantages of motorcycles (you get cold, you might die) and none of the advantages (they're neither fast nor good for weaving in and out of traffic). But to cross America, coast to coast, by any other means would have been ridiculous. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper did it on Harleys, so I was going to do it on a Harley, too. </p> <p>And they have good names: Night Train, Dyna Low Rider, Fatboy, Electra Glide. Mine was a Heritage Softail Classic. Heritage, I imagine, means that this bike has a lot of pedigree. The Softail bit refers to the rear suspension. Classic speaks for itself. I rented it in New Jersey for three weeks, to be returned in Los Angeles. </p> <p>It was red, and there was a lot of chrome about the place, and black studded leather - nothing like my Vespa at all. For a start, it had a 1,340cc - or bigger than a lot of cars. And I had absolutely no idea how to operate it, but I wasn't going to let them know that. Right, here's a button with \"Start\" written on it... Brrrmmm. There's that pneumatic drill noise. Now, which way to New York? </p> <p>That was probably the scariest bit of all, that first ride into Manhattan. Before I had a chance to think about it and do something more sensible, we were out on a highway with an absurd number of lanes. (Note that the bike and I have already become \"we\".) I was pretty sure we would make a wrong turn somewhere and do a Bonfire of the Vanities. But then we got on to one of those wonderful skyways, and there was Manhattan stretched out in front, glorious in the autumn sunshine. I let out a whoop (the first of many), a mixture of sheer joy and extreme terror. </p> <p>Twenty days later, we rolled into Los Angeles. Twenty days, 4,283 miles, 13 states, one-and-a-half breakdowns, one wedding (not mine) and one dead chipmunk. I tried to avoid the chipmunk, promise, but like I said, Harleys aren't really bikes for swerving. Oh, and half a suntan - because when you go west for a long time, only the left side of your face gets done. </p> <p>I'm not sure how it worked out as 4,283 miles (that's London to Delhi, or Chicago even, if you're a crow and you have a lot of stamina). In my Rand McNally Road Atlas, it says New York to Los Angeles is 2,824 miles. We did avoid the interstates, the big multi-laned roads, where possible, and took a few detours. And detours in the US tend to be about 400 miles, generally. </p> <p>We stayed a day and a night in New York, then set off up the Hudson River - or next to it rather - past Bear Mountain, where Sal Paradise turned back for the first time in On The Road because it was raining. But it wasn't raining, so we kept going, up through New York State with all the trees doing their big fall show-off display. Woodstock for bad art and very good blueberry pancakes, Ithaca for the finger lakes, Niagara Falls for the big waterfall (good, but not as good as the fountain display in front of the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas). After that, it was pretty much west: Buffalo, Cleveland, Chicago for the wedding. Then the big skies and cornscapes of the Mid-West - like Lincolnshire, except forever. (And there's Lincoln right in the middle, just to prove it.) </p> <p>Route 66 only exists in parts now, and anyway we were a long way north of it. But we found lots of other good, romantic roads. Like Route 28 through the Catskill Mountains, 92 across the plains of Iowa, or 2 through Nebraska. The road is everything in America; it has a romantic quality you just don't find on the M6. This is because they are much, much longer; you spend a lot more time on them, so they do assume characters. Most states even have an \"Adopt a Highway\" scheme. In this country, we adopt elephants at the zoo. Americans adopt American roads. </p> <p>It's a big, old place, the States. I think that really struck me round about Nebraska, probably on Highway 2 - lonely Highway 2 - which meanders through Nebraska's sand hills. This is how lonely Highway 2 is: at the start of the trip I reserved my waves strictly for other Harleys (not so much a wave, actually, more of a subtle gesture with the left hand). But as you get further into the heart of the country, there aren't so many around, so you have to wave at any old bike. And then you start getting roads where even a car or a truck is so rare it deserves a wave. On highway 2, I was waving at trees. </p> <p>Trees and trains, because Highway 2 runs beside the railroad. Some trains they were, too: 120 wagons of coal coming east from Wyoming. That's a mile long. And they blasted their horns back at me when I waved - that sad noise only American trains do properly. I can't explain how special it is to have a mile-long train say hello to you. </p> <p>As you get further away from the coast you start to notice stuff - like how the people get friendlier and less attractive. And their jeans fit less well. I discovered the place with the worst fitting jeans in the world: Iowa 80 (named after the state it's in and the road it's on). It's a huge truck stop; a glorious city of arcade games, Wendy's, shops selling soft toys, model cars, games. </p> <p>We cut a little corner of Wyoming, then Colorado and over the Rockies, and down through the canyons and deserts of the southwest to California. </p> <p>The southwest was best to ride through - Colorado, Utah, Arizona - where deserted roads twist along the bottom of red canyons, or run straight across big country, scenery you recognise from a thousand films. This was, I realised, what I'd come for. And it was here that I began to understand what Harley- Davidsons are all about. They're the Bentley Continentals of the two-wheeled world. They're not for nipping about town; they're for effortless, comfortable cruising across big countries, preferably America. </p> <p>In Colorado, I discovered the throttle lock. You pick your favoured engine speed, lock on to it, and then there's nothing to do at all. You can study the map, take photos, or just sit back and watch as America slides under that big, fat, chrome headlamp up front. And in Colorado, you don't need to wear a helmet, so you've got the wind in your hair as well. Truly wonderful. Now, if I'd had an Electra Glide I would have had a cassette player, too, a journey with a soundtrack...</p> <p>There were lots of good times. Like going over big bridges - it's a wonderful thing to go over a big bridge on a motorcycle. And crossing big rivers, rivers you know all about from school: the Hudson, Mississippi, Missouri, Colorado. We went through bridges, too - little covered ones, in Madison County, Iowa. Yes, those bridges. </p> <p>Carhenge was a good time - a copy of Stonehenge made from old cars, in a remote cornfield in the panhandle of Nebraska. And Mesa Verde National Park, high up in Colorado, was wonderful, once home to the Anastasia people who lived in towered dwellings in the sides of cliffs. And the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, it goes on. </p> <p>There was, of course, the odd bad time. Like the girl at the Super 8 motel in Kingston - she was definitely a bad time: </p> <p>\"We're all full.\" </p> <p>\"Yes, I know. You said. But are there any other motels in Kingston?\" </p> <p>\"They're all full.\" </p> <p>\"Where do you think I might find a motel that isn't full?\" </p> <p>\"I don't know.\" </p> <p>And so it went on. She was very determined not to pass on any information that might be of any help to me. They weren't all full either. I hope you rot in that reception in Kingston the rest of your life, honey. </p> <p>The wind in Wyoming was a bad time, too, so strong we had to ride at an angle just to stay upright, if that makes sense. And it was cold at 12,000ft in the Rockies, but we missed the snow by a day and the hot springs at Idaho Springs, on the other side, soon warm you up. </p> <p>Breaking down on Interstate 80 going into Cleveland started off being bad. There was a popping noise, and we just stopped. Now I'm no expert in the art of motorcycle maintenance, so I just sat there, wondering what the hell to do... for about four minutes: then state patrolman Art Demico showed up in his patrol car and got on the radio. \"Got one from London here, and I don't mean London, Ohio.\" Art also said I should have been on a Honda; where's your patriotism, man? </p> <p>Within an hour, I was on the back of a tow truck, on the way to South East Harley-Davidson, where I had to say everything twice because the way I spoke cracked them up so much. I was happy to keep them amused so long as they fixed it - an electrical problem they said. </p> <p>The other half time I broke down was when the starter motor packed up in the Rockies, which just meant I could only stop on slopes until I got it fixed in Vegas. But that wasn't so bad because it's mostly downhill to Vegas. </p> <p>It got a little lonely at times. I'd done a long motorcycle trip before - Madras to Colchester - but I'd forgotten how little there is to do except think. And sing, but I don't know more than the beginnings of many songs. So I just read the signs by the side of the road: \"Re-elect Fox sheriff\", \"Single-shot training rifles at $59.95\" (tempting), \"We fought four wars for this land\", \"The 10 commandments aren't suggestions\". </p> <p>And I like American place names, too. Generally it's obvious how they came about: Muddy Creek, Red Lake, Pleasant View (though Disappointment Valley I thought was wonderful). But you do get the odd one: What Cheer, Normal, Hygiene, Paradox. </p> <p>I also found the fastest way to dry socks in the world: tie them to the handlebars and drive them at 75mph through the Nevada desert. </p> <p>I knew my way round Los Angeles before I got there because I'd driven a Harley round it on an arcade game in the Harley-Davidson Caf\u00e9 in Las Vegas a couple of days earlier. Interesting that on a day off, while the bike was being fixed, I'd gone to the Harley-Davidson Caf\u00e9 and sat at the bar on a Harley-Davidson seat. But it got like that; after a while, you just want to go on and on. </p> <p>Arriving in LA was exciting and a little sad. Exciting because we'd made it across, and sad because it was all over. We went to see the sea at Santa Monica, just to prove we'd made it all the way across.

      "bodyText": "\"You see things vacationing on a motorcycle in a way that is completely different from any other. In a car, you're always in a compartment, and because you're used to it you don't realise that through that car window everything you see is just more TV. You're a passive observer and it is all moving by you boringly in a frame. On a cycle the frame is gone. You're completely in contact with it all. You're in the scene, not just watching it anymore, and the sense of presence is overwhelming.\" Robert M Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance It had to be a Harley-Davidson. I don't care for them much normally - big, cumbersome, noisy things with all the disadvantages of motorcycles (you get cold, you might die) and none of the advantages (they're neither fast nor good for weaving in and out of traffic). But to cross America, coast to coast, by any other means would have been ridiculous. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper did it on Harleys, so I was going to do it on a Harley, too. And they have good names: Night Train, Dyna Low Rider, Fatboy, Electra Glide. Mine was a Heritage Softail Classic. Heritage, I imagine, means that this bike has a lot of pedigree. The Softail bit refers to the rear suspension. Classic speaks for itself. I rented it in New Jersey for three weeks, to be returned in Los Angeles. It was red, and there was a lot of chrome about the place, and black studded leather - nothing like my Vespa at all. For a start, it had a 1,340cc - or bigger than a lot of cars. And I had absolutely no idea how to operate it, but I wasn't going to let them know that. Right, here's a button with \"Start\" written on it... Brrrmmm. There's that pneumatic drill noise. Now, which way to New York? That was probably the scariest bit of all, that first ride into Manhattan. Before I had a chance to think about it and do something more sensible, we were out on a highway with an absurd number of lanes. (Note that the bike and I have already become \"we\".) I was pretty sure we would make a wrong turn somewhere and do a Bonfire of the Vanities. But then we got on to one of those wonderful skyways, and there was Manhattan stretched out in front, glorious in the autumn sunshine. I let out a whoop (the first of many), a mixture of sheer joy and extreme terror. Twenty days later, we rolled into Los Angeles. Twenty days, 4,283 miles, 13 states, one-and-a-half breakdowns, one wedding (not mine) and one dead chipmunk. I tried to avoid the chipmunk, promise, but like I said, Harleys aren't really bikes for swerving. Oh, and half a suntan - because when you go west for a long time, only the left side of your face gets done. I'm not sure how it worked out as 4,283 miles (that's London to Delhi, or Chicago even, if you're a crow and you have a lot of stamina). In my Rand McNally Road Atlas, it says New York to Los Angeles is 2,824 miles. We did avoid the interstates, the big multi-laned roads, where possible, and took a few detours. And detours in the US tend to be about 400 miles, generally. We stayed a day and a night in New York, then set off up the Hudson River - or next to it rather - past Bear Mountain, where Sal Paradise turned back for the first time in On The Road because it was raining. But it wasn't raining, so we kept going, up through New York State with all the trees doing their big fall show-off display. Woodstock for bad art and very good blueberry pancakes, Ithaca for the finger lakes, Niagara Falls for the big waterfall (good, but not as good as the fountain display in front of the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas). After that, it was pretty much west: Buffalo, Cleveland, Chicago for the wedding. Then the big skies and cornscapes of the Mid-West - like Lincolnshire, except forever. (And there's Lincoln right in the middle, just to prove it.) Route 66 only exists in parts now, and anyway we were a long way north of it. But we found lots of other good, romantic roads. Like Route 28 through the Catskill Mountains, 92 across the plains of Iowa, or 2 through Nebraska. The road is everything in America; it has a romantic quality you just don't find on the M6. This is because they are much, much longer; you spend a lot more time on them, so they do assume characters. Most states even have an \"Adopt a Highway\" scheme. In this country, we adopt elephants at the zoo. Americans adopt American roads. It's a big, old place, the States. I think that really struck me round about Nebraska, probably on Highway 2 - lonely Highway 2 - which meanders through Nebraska's sand hills. This is how lonely Highway 2 is: at the start of the trip I reserved my waves strictly for other Harleys (not so much a wave, actually, more of a subtle gesture with the left hand). But as you get further into the heart of the country, there aren't so many around, so you have to wave at any old bike. And then you start getting roads where even a car or a truck is so rare it deserves a wave. On highway 2, I was waving at trees. Trees and trains, because Highway 2 runs beside the railroad. Some trains they were, too: 120 wagons of coal coming east from Wyoming. That's a mile long. And they blasted their horns back at me when I waved - that sad noise only American trains do properly. I can't explain how special it is to have a mile-long train say hello to you. As you get further away from the coast you start to notice stuff - like how the people get friendlier and less attractive. And their jeans fit less well. I discovered the place with the worst fitting jeans in the world: Iowa 80 (named after the state it's in and the road it's on). It's a huge truck stop; a glorious city of arcade games, Wendy's, shops selling soft toys, model cars, games. We cut a little corner of Wyoming, then Colorado and over the Rockies, and down through the canyons and deserts of the southwest to California. The southwest was best to ride through - Colorado, Utah, Arizona - where deserted roads twist along the bottom of red canyons, or run straight across big country, scenery you recognise from a thousand films. This was, I realised, what I'd come for. And it was here that I began to understand what Harley- Davidsons are all about. They're the Bentley Continentals of the two-wheeled world. They're not for nipping about town; they're for effortless, comfortable cruising across big countries, preferably America. In Colorado, I discovered the throttle lock. You pick your favoured engine speed, lock on to it, and then there's nothing to do at all. You can study the map, take photos, or just sit back and watch as America slides under that big, fat, chrome headlamp up front. And in Colorado, you don't need to wear a helmet, so you've got the wind in your hair as well. Truly wonderful. Now, if I'd had an Electra Glide I would have had a cassette player, too, a journey with a soundtrack... There were lots of good times. Like going over big bridges - it's a wonderful thing to go over a big bridge on a motorcycle. And crossing big rivers, rivers you know all about from school: the Hudson, Mississippi, Missouri, Colorado. We went through bridges, too - little covered ones, in Madison County, Iowa. Yes, those bridges. Carhenge was a good time - a copy of Stonehenge made from old cars, in a remote cornfield in the panhandle of Nebraska. And Mesa Verde National Park, high up in Colorado, was wonderful, once home to the Anastasia people who lived in towered dwellings in the sides of cliffs. And the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, it goes on. There was, of course, the odd bad time. Like the girl at the Super 8 motel in Kingston - she was definitely a bad time: \"We're all full.\" \"Yes, I know. You said. But are there any other motels in Kingston?\" \"They're all full.\" \"Where do you think I might find a motel that isn't full?\" \"I don't know.\" And so it went on. She was very determined not to pass on any information that might be of any help to me. They weren't all full either. I hope you rot in that reception in Kingston the rest of your life, honey. The wind in Wyoming was a bad time, too, so strong we had to ride at an angle just to stay upright, if that makes sense. And it was cold at 12,000ft in the Rockies, but we missed the snow by a day and the hot springs at Idaho Springs, on the other side, soon warm you up. Breaking down on Interstate 80 going into Cleveland started off being bad. There was a popping noise, and we just stopped. Now I'm no expert in the art of motorcycle maintenance, so I just sat there, wondering what the hell to do... for about four minutes: then state patrolman Art Demico showed up in his patrol car and got on the radio. \"Got one from London here, and I don't mean London, Ohio.\" Art also said I should have been on a Honda; where's your patriotism, man? Within an hour, I was on the back of a tow truck, on the way to South East Harley-Davidson, where I had to say everything twice because the way I spoke cracked them up so much. I was happy to keep them amused so long as they fixed it - an electrical problem they said.

I'd done a long motorcycle trip before - Madras to Colchester - but I'd forgotten how little there is to do except think. And sing, but I don't know more than the beginnings of many songs. So I just read the signs by the side of the road: \"Re-elect Fox sheriff\", \"Single-shot training rifles at $59.95\" (tempting), \"We fought four wars for this land\", \"The 10 commandments aren't suggestions\". And I like American place names, too. Generally it's obvious how they came about: Muddy Creek, Red Lake, Pleasant View (though Disappointment Valley I thought was wonderful).

Admit you're going to the Bahamas or Las Vegas, for instance, and your interrogator will swoon \"Oooo... gorgeous.\" If you say you're going to Belgium or Sark, on the other hand, they'll giggle and say, \"Poor you! Are you being punished for something?\" Then there are the in-between places; Madeira is one of these. When I told people I was going there, they looked blank for a minute and then said, \"So.

Frankly, and I know it sounds spoilt, I couldn't have looked at another long-haul holiday this year, though I'll probably get over it by, oh, next February. I've never had a long-haul holiday that wasn't overshadowed by the spectre of the return flight.

We're all going to perish!\" speech bubbles on the safety procedure cartoons. </p> <p>And for such a short flight, Madeira is hot; even in its winter months, December and January, it was hot enough to swim in the Atlantic. In summer, it can be hotter than Brazil. To make it even better, they're on exactly the same time as us. </p> <p>There are drawbacks. The phrase \"Rain stopped play\" takes on a whole new meaning in Madeira. Its strange climate means that while we were there, there was snow on the mountains yet we were swimming in a warmish sea. One of the ways that Madeirans get their kicks, apparently, is to drive up into the snowy mountains, build a snowman, stick him on the roof-rack and watch him melt as he's driven back down into the noon-day heat - it must be post-modern or something. But, in compensation for the rain, you get the amazing flora of Madeira, whereby blooms that would cost you \u00a37 a head in a poncey London bouquet here grow as high as a horse by the roadsides. </p> <p>There are no beaches - Madeira is built on a towering volcanic crater that looms over the sea like an ocean-liner. To make up for this, though, it is covered with the most gorgeous swimming pools. Outdoor swimming pools and lidos are my passion and, since I've been going abroad, I've been really disappointed, especially in the Caribbean and the US, at the way one can invariably stand up in them, even at the \"deep\" end, and the way there have to be more lifeguards than swimmers. But in Madeira, they're good and deep, with negligible fussing. </p> <p>Perhaps one of the reasons for this is that there are so few children around. Tourists here tend to be quite a bit older than the average; ideally, you could dump your teenage children on the nearby Canary Islands and then come here for a bit of grown-up R&amp;R. Suitably, the harbour capital of Funchal - all white houses, black shutters and terracotta roofs; Gothic Lite and a bit like the magic city in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang - also resembles Torquay (and I say this as one who loves Torquay beyond all other places) if God had got angry and thrown it against a huge wall. </p> <p>You've never seen a place built on such a steep incline - one day we went up so far into the mountains that we literally had our heads in the clouds. This, along with the riot of flowers, gives Madeira a slightly strange, unbalanced look. There is a distinct air of eccentricity about the place, which sits pleasingly alongside the reserve of the Portuguese-descended islanders. Think about it, the Portuguese must be the most unknowable, unclassifiable people in Europe, despite the amount of tourists who've been there. We all know what a typical Frenchman, Italian or German is like, but what character traits sum up the Portuguese? </p> <p>This eccentricity seems like complete and utter madness when you go out on a boat along the coastline of Madeira and look at the layers of volcanic rock and the petrified lava trails; once more, you have to marvel at mankind's ingenuity and bull-headedness. \"Here's an old volcano - I'll live on it, I will! And, furthermore, I'll make it a floating flower shop!\" </p> <p>The effort that has gone into making Madeira blossom - without aid of tractors, thanks to its severe slopes - can be seen everywhere, even in the national dance. These are usually jolly, mindless affairs, but the Madeiran version is all about the back-breaking bending it takes to till the soil - to the unitiated, it can look as though the dancer has dropped a contact lens and is doing his or her level best to find it. Another dance, the Ponto do Sol, recalls the island's involvement with slavery, as the dancers move with bowed heads, their feet shuffling as though chained. Ibiza it isn't. </p> <p>But again, this is Madeira's strength rather than its weakness. For surely Ibiza could never live up to the high standards of Reid's Palace, the strange and beautiful hotel which, set in 10 acres of sub-tropical garden, looms 150 feet above the Atlantic like a House of Usher dedicated to service and excellence. The dream of a young Scot, William Reid - who arrived in Madeira in 1886 with \u00a35 in his pocket but died just before its completion in 1891 - Reid's is one of those hotels, like Raffles in Singapore, that people actually visit for itself as opposed to the country around it and, of course, for the sheer snob appeal of the people who have stayed there before; in this case, not only all the royal white trash of Europe but GB Shaw, Rainer Maria Rilke, Gregory Peck (they made \"Moby Dick\" here - no cracks), the Sitwells, Albert Schweitzer, John dos Passos, Anthony Eden and Lloyd George. </p> <p>Most famously, though, Reid's was the choice of the ailing Winston Churchill, who first arrived in January 1950, understandably exhausted after a lifetime of getting drunk and saving civilisation as we know it. The Churchills occupied a suite of rooms on the ground floor, which had been Lloyd George's holiday home a quarter of a century earlier. This is where we stayed. </p> <p>Churchill wouldn't have had the fax machine or the TV at the foot of the bed that rose out of a large silver box with a flick of a switch, but he would have appreciated the Illustrated London News and the ashtrays everywhere, which even to a non-smoking wretch such as I signalled a haven of civilisation and tranquillity. </p> <p>There were old Vicky cartoons of him all over the suite - as a cowboy and as Sir Walter Raleigh - and one of his watercolours of the nearby harbour town of Camara de Lobos in the vestibule. It was very weird, in a nice kind of way, to sit in his drawing room with the radio tuned to a strange, un-named, ghost station that played song after song from the Thirties and Forties: Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree, I'll Be Seeing You and all the Glenn Miller tunes. </p> <p>But it would be wrong to indicate that Reid's is some sort of mausoleum. It is run with the sort of sumptuous efficiency that is thrilling in an almost sexual way, like being in bed with someone who knows eactly what you want without you telling them (in my case, these days, this is usually a hot-water bottle). Everything worked beautifully. The bathroom, for instance, held the only shower attachment (there was also a separate shower room) I've ever come across which had to be approached as though it was a jet-ski every time you wanted to rinse your hair, so powerful and likely to leap out of your hand was it if you turned it up too high. </p> <p>Extremely clean, we took ourselves off to the cocktail bar to drink champagne cocktails made with the passion-fruit juice that is so ubiquitous on this island (also used to make Maracuja, the local soda) and thence to Les Faunes, one of its four restaurants. Picasso used to draw on the tablecloths here, but I told my sweetie that perhaps he shouldn't. Instead, we ate duck and artichoke pat\u00e9, scallops wrapped in spinach, beef tenderloin with celery and parmesan and drank a gorgeous Portuguese wine, Jo\u00e3o Pires. (There's another Portuguese wine called BSE that I didn't much like the sound of.) </p> <p>We could hear the piano next door, playing all those songs that make you feel really glad to be modern and complex and divorced: It's Almost Like Being in Love, The Lady is a Tramp and Night and Day. It was swoonsome. </p> <p>Back in our suite, instead of the usual crap satellite channels showing films starring Melanie Griffiths and Steve Guttenberg, we could have ordered up from the Oscar Library, offering every winner of Best Film from 1928 to 1998. Instead, we found the TV equivalent of the ghost radio station, and were amazed to be confronted with Fred Astaire singing There's a Small Hotel, followed by Nice Work If You Can Get It. You really couldn't make it up. </p> <p>The danger of a hotel like Reid's, combined with the tendency towards rain, is that it's so tempting just to stay put; especially if you're with someone you really like. It's so nice to sit having tea on the terrace, watching the luxury liners carry their lush burden of sorrows, and feeling like a Noel Coward heroine driven into exile by unspecified scandalous behaviour. </p> <p>\"Do you miss England terribly, darling?\" </p> <p>\"Terribly, darling. But I could murder another ginja [cherry liquor]. Cheers!\" </p> <p>On the third day, we made ourselves go out for one of the notorious toboggan rides. To do this, you have to get to Monte, the hill town above Funchal where in the 19th century the wealthy merchants and aristocratic European immigrants built their gorgeous homes, or quintas, away from the bustle of Funchal. If you like museums and gardens, you're in for a big treat; I don't and desperately needed to be thrilled or scared or both in order to clear my head. One 10-minute ride in the toboggans of Monte - wicker chairs attached to basic sleds - with two men pushing and pulling you down the staggeringly steep three-mile hill leading back down to Funchal, will take 10 years off your life and stay with you forever. </p> <p>Funchal could never be mistaken for one of the great cities of the world. But the lights reflected magically off the lovely monochrome mosaics of the pavements and squares, and the people are charming, with none of the smarm that passes for charm in Americanised tourist haunts. It's not the sort of place that you can imagine wanting to come back to time after time, but it is a place you can imagine wanting to live in, which is surely more of a compliment. </p> <p>Madeira is a strange and beautiful island, whose respectability hides a basic non-conformity. The week we were there, the first McDonald's opened; in any other country you'd have had a riot as people pushed and shoved to purchase their quarter pound of the American Dream, but the Madeirans were altogether more reserved, examining the outside menu for ages, often walking away with a smile and a shake of the head. </p> <p>We watched as four old men in their generation's preferred rig of suits and berets (leather jackets are favoured by men under 45), fags in mouth (everyone in Funchal smokes in the street), approach and peer in. Two of them decided to risk it; the other two pulled them back. They stood on the pavement debating the matter for a good five minutes before the two rebels took the plunge, their friends walking away shaking their heads. </p> <p>Even teenagers who had muscled in enthusiastically came out looking somewhat confused and dismayed. \"Was that the great McDonald's experience? Is that all there is?\" Tellingly, it opened the day after, not before, their independence day. Though I was only there for a week, it seems to me that the Madeirans - unlike other nations, both richer and poorer - would never knowingly compromise their national pride; not even for extra fries.</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Julie Burchill travelled to Madeira with Cadogan Holidays (023 808 28303).

      "bodyText": "Since I became a globetrotter five years ago, I have learned that some holiday destinations provoke an immediately favourable response from people, like sex and chocolate. Admit you're going to the Bahamas or Las Vegas, for instance, and your interrogator will swoon \"Oooo... gorgeous.\" If you say you're going to Belgium or Sark, on the other hand, they'll giggle and say, \"Poor you! Are you being punished for something?\" Then there are the in-between places; Madeira is one of these. When I told people I was going there, they looked blank for a minute and then said, \"So. Is that good or bad?\" I'm here to tell you that it's very, very good, for several reasons. First, Madeira is only three and a half hours away on the plane. Three and a half hours! Frankly, and I know it sounds spoilt, I couldn't have looked at another long-haul holiday this year, though I'll probably get over it by, oh, next February. I've never had a long-haul holiday that wasn't overshadowed by the spectre of the return flight. But three and a half hours is just time enough to toy with a cold drink and a hot boy, bolt down an airport novel, take a light lunch and draw \"Aagh!

      "body": "<p>I am standing on the steps of the Sydney Opera House on a glorious sunny afternoon in early February, surrounded by 22,000 revellers. Descending from the sky on a crane is a Sister of Perpetual Indulgence, the order of gay male nuns. Dressed in a fresh-starched habit and clutching a pink rosary, his blessings ceremonially launch the Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras - three weeks of non-stop parties, plus parallel sporting and cultural festivals, culminating in the grand parade and post-parade party. </p> <p>During Mardi Gras, Sydney becomes the queerest place on Earth - the closest thing to Homo Heaven. Mardi Gras totally dominates the city. Yet heterosexuals don't feel threatened. They join in. More than 600,000 line the streets to watch the night-time parade of glittering floats and costumed marchers. So many straight people want to go to the end-of-parade party that the organisers have had to restrict sales to gay outlets. Mardi Gras is, my dear, The Event in the Sydney calendar. Everybody who's anybody wants to party with the faggerati. </p> <p>So many parties, so little time. Will it be the Blue Hawaii Pool Party? The theme is South Pacific, as Victoria Park swimming pool is transformed into a tropical island paradise and everyone splashes around in their bikinis - even the boys. </p> <p>Or should I wait for the Chinese New Year Party? To the sounds of Chinese techno, the city's Asian gay community is celebrating The Year of the Rabbit in Sydney's stunning oriental gardens, reputedly the finest outside Beijing. </p> <p>Or how about the Harbour Party? Staged in the Royal Botanic Gardens, on a spit of land jutting out into Sydney Harbour and overlooking the Opera House, this has to be the most spectacular dance party location in the world. On a balmy summer's evening, as tugboats spray water jets 100 metres in the air, 3,500 gorgeous fags and dykes party the night away. Showing off their bronzed, gym-honed bodies, most are stripped to the waist. </p> <p>Call me greedy, but I did all three. Afterwards, I squeezed in Fair Day as well. This open-air Oz Pop festival and picnic-in-the-park pulls in 60,000 people. But the side events grabbed my attention most, especially the dog drag show - it was toss up between the spike and leatherette SM bulldog and the poodle in pink tights and tutu. Ms Fair Day competition was also a hoot. More drag. This time human, though some may disagree. Boys dressed as girls dressed as boys. So confusing, but that's part of the fun. </p> <p>As for the costumes: how on earth did he/she manage with those four-foot high sequinned platforms and that three-tiered wedding cake hat with a groom and groom on top? As we all know, queens love to shop, and Mardi Gras has a tailor-made event to fulfil every big spender fantasy. Shop Yourself Stupid is nirvana for shopaholics, and all for a good cause. More than 300 of Sydney's most stylish stores join forces to donate a share of the day's takings to the Aids charity, the Bobby Goldsmith Foundation. Sixty drag queens on stilts mince up and down the main shopping thoroughfares all day, urging everyone to \"Spend! Spend! Spend!\" The result: $80,000 raised for the care of people with HIV. </p> <p>In Sydney, the pink dollar has real clout. Mardi Gras is sponsored by the national airline, Qantas, and by the national telecom corporation, Telstra. Bus shelters and billboards all over the city advertise the festivities with the slogan \"Gay Icon\", a reference to the official online Mardi Gras guide, which is sponsored by the leading daily newspaper, Sydney Morning Herald. Big bucks are at stake. Mardi Gras earns nearly $100 million for the local economy, generating more income than any other cultural or sporting event in Australia. </p> <p>Much more than a three-week party, Mardi Gras also offers unexpected treats for Mr and Ms Butch. The sports festival is a mini-gay Olympics, ranging from big girl's blouse events like softball and golf, to the hardman sports of ju-jitsu and triathlon. </p> <p>For those who love the wilderness, the Southern Cross Outdoors Group organises special Mardi Gras \"queer treks\" in the nearby Blue Mountains - Australia's version of the Grand Canyon. I joined 50 designer-label-wearing gay bushwalkers for an 8km hike at Wentworth Falls, retracing the steps of Charles Darwin in 1836. </p> <p>For the cerebrally-minded, Mardi Gras has some absolute gems. The cultural festival brings in audiences of 250,000, and showcases some brilliant avant-garde performances. Move over Xena! Razor Baby, performed by the dykon aerialists of Club Swing, fuses martial arts, dance, gymnastics and trapeze dare-devilry, backed by an all-women big percussion band. </p> <p>If it's laughs you want, look no further than the Mile-High Club: cabaret hosted by Pam Ann, \"the world's greatest celebrity air hostess\". And for the highbrow, there is the Opera House. I made sure I didn't miss the stunning homoerotic production of Billy Budd, with its semi-naked, all-male cast tenderly vocalising Britten's tragedy of sexual repression and class privilege. </p> <p>But all these events are just foreplay, leading up to the orgasmic grand finale: the spectacular street parade of floats and marching ensembles, followed by the mother of all dance parties. Tonight is that night. It is 8pm and getting dark. Rev Fred Nile (Australia's Mary Whitehouse) is still praying for rain. But God refuses to punish us sodomites. Who cares? We're here to party. And so is half of straight Sydney. Mums and dads, and loads of kids. Japanese tourists. Mardi Gras transcends all barriers. </p> <p>And they're off! More than 200 entries, led by Dykes on Bikes, the 30-strong, leather-clad lesbian motorcycle club. On come the massed ranks of the marching ensembles: the Bassey Bitches (30 Shirley look-alikes belting out Hey, Big Spender), the George Michaels (40 women dressed as LAPD officers escorting a George Michael clone) and the Monicas (50 Lewinsky impersonators wearing stained blue dresses and waving moist cigars). </p> <p>Then there's some political satire with a float featuring a two-faced caricature of Labour State premier, Bob Carr, condemning his failure to deliver same-sex partnership rights. Can satire change the world? A couple of months later, Carr granted legal recognition to gay couples. Poking fun at oppressive religion, the Temple of More Men float is a take-off of the Mormon Church, featuring the \"More Men Tab-of-acid\" male choir singing \"hims\", shouting \"A mens!\", and \"promoting faith in disco devotion\". </p> <p>Two dazzling hours later, the parade is over and the party begins. Twenty thousand people pour into four aircraft-hanger-sized pavilions at the Showgrounds for the biggest queer rave in the world, lasting from 10pm to 10am the next morning. </p> <p>The Big Top has an \"Aloha Dot\" South Sea islands theme and hosts the costume pageant, presided over by Jean-Paul Gaultier.

      "bodyText": "I am standing on the steps of the Sydney Opera House on a glorious sunny afternoon in early February, surrounded by 22,000 revellers. Descending from the sky on a crane is a Sister of Perpetual Indulgence, the order of gay male nuns. Dressed in a fresh-starched habit and clutching a pink rosary, his blessings ceremonially launch the Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras - three weeks of non-stop parties, plus parallel sporting and cultural festivals, culminating in the grand parade and post-parade party. During Mardi Gras, Sydney becomes the queerest place on Earth - the closest thing to Homo Heaven. Mardi Gras totally dominates the city. Yet heterosexuals don't feel threatened. They join in. More than 600,000 line the streets to watch the night-time parade of glittering floats and costumed marchers. So many straight people want to go to the end-of-parade party that the organisers have had to restrict sales to gay outlets. Mardi Gras is, my dear, The Event in the Sydney calendar. Everybody who's anybody wants to party with the faggerati. So many parties, so little time. Will it be the Blue Hawaii Pool Party? The theme is South Pacific, as Victoria Park swimming pool is transformed into a tropical island paradise and everyone splashes around in their bikinis - even the boys. Or should I wait for the Chinese New Year Party? To the sounds of Chinese techno, the city's Asian gay community is celebrating The Year of the Rabbit in Sydney's stunning oriental gardens, reputedly the finest outside Beijing. Or how about the Harbour Party? Staged in the Royal Botanic Gardens, on a spit of land jutting out into Sydney Harbour and overlooking the Opera House, this has to be the most spectacular dance party location in the world. On a balmy summer's evening, as tugboats spray water jets 100 metres in the air, 3,500 gorgeous fags and dykes party the night away. Showing off their bronzed, gym-honed bodies, most are stripped to the waist. Call me greedy, but I did all three. Afterwards, I squeezed in Fair Day as well. This open-air Oz Pop festival and picnic-in-the-park pulls in 60,000 people. But the side events grabbed my attention most, especially the dog drag show - it was toss up between the spike and leatherette SM bulldog and the poodle in pink tights and tutu. Ms Fair Day competition was also a hoot. More drag. This time human, though some may disagree. Boys dressed as girls dressed as boys. So confusing, but that's part of the fun. As for the costumes: how on earth did he/she manage with those four-foot high sequinned platforms and that three-tiered wedding cake hat with a groom and groom on top? As we all know, queens love to shop, and Mardi Gras has a tailor-made event to fulfil every big spender fantasy. Shop Yourself Stupid is nirvana for shopaholics, and all for a good cause. More than 300 of Sydney's most stylish stores join forces to donate a share of the day's takings to the Aids charity, the Bobby Goldsmith Foundation. Sixty drag queens on stilts mince up and down the main shopping thoroughfares all day, urging everyone to \"Spend! Spend! Spend!\" The result: $80,000 raised for the care of people with HIV. In Sydney, the pink dollar has real clout. Mardi Gras is sponsored by the national airline, Qantas, and by the national telecom corporation, Telstra. Bus shelters and billboards all over the city advertise the festivities with the slogan \"Gay Icon\", a reference to the official online Mardi Gras guide, which is sponsored by the leading daily newspaper, Sydney Morning Herald. Big bucks are at stake. Mardi Gras earns nearly $100 million for the local economy, generating more income than any other cultural or sporting event in Australia. Much more than a three-week party, Mardi Gras also offers unexpected treats for Mr and Ms Butch. The sports festival is a mini-gay Olympics, ranging from big girl's blouse events like softball and golf, to the hardman sports of ju-jitsu and triathlon. For those who love the wilderness, the Southern Cross Outdoors Group organises special Mardi Gras \"queer treks\" in the nearby Blue Mountains - Australia's version of the Grand Canyon. I joined 50 designer-label-wearing gay bushwalkers for an 8km hike at Wentworth Falls, retracing the steps of Charles Darwin in 1836. For the cerebrally-minded, Mardi Gras has some absolute gems. The cultural festival brings in audiences of 250,000, and showcases some brilliant avant-garde performances. Move over Xena! Razor Baby, performed by the dykon aerialists of Club Swing, fuses martial arts, dance, gymnastics and trapeze dare-devilry, backed by an all-women big percussion band. If it's laughs you want, look no further than the Mile-High Club: cabaret hosted by Pam Ann, \"the world's greatest celebrity air hostess\". And for the highbrow, there is the Opera House. I made sure I didn't miss the stunning homoerotic production of Billy Budd, with its semi-naked, all-male cast tenderly vocalising Britten's tragedy of sexual repression and class privilege. But all these events are just foreplay, leading up to the orgasmic grand finale: the spectacular street parade of floats and marching ensembles, followed by the mother of all dance parties. Tonight is that night. It is 8pm and getting dark. Rev Fred Nile (Australia's Mary Whitehouse) is still praying for rain. But God refuses to punish us sodomites. Who cares? We're here to party. And so is half of straight Sydney. Mums and dads, and loads of kids. Japanese tourists. Mardi Gras transcends all barriers. And they're off! More than 200 entries, led by Dykes on Bikes, the 30-strong, leather-clad lesbian motorcycle club. On come the massed ranks of the marching ensembles: the Bassey Bitches (30 Shirley look-alikes belting out Hey, Big Spender), the George Michaels (40 women dressed as LAPD officers escorting a George Michael clone) and the Monicas (50 Lewinsky impersonators wearing stained blue dresses and waving moist cigars). Then there's some political satire with a float featuring a two-faced caricature of Labour State premier, Bob Carr, condemning his failure to deliver same-sex partnership rights. Can satire change the world? A couple of months later, Carr granted legal recognition to gay couples. Poking fun at oppressive religion, the Temple of More Men float is a take-off of the Mormon Church, featuring the \"More Men Tab-of-acid\" male choir singing \"hims\", shouting \"A mens!\", and \"promoting faith in disco devotion\". Two dazzling hours later, the parade is over and the party begins. Twenty thousand people pour into four aircraft-hanger-sized pavilions at the Showgrounds for the biggest queer rave in the world, lasting from 10pm to 10am the next morning. The Big Top has an \"Aloha Dot\" South Sea islands theme and hosts the costume pageant, presided over by Jean-Paul Gaultier. With giant wind machines, The Dome is the \"Temple of Thunder\". Topping both is the Horden Pavilion - \"Satellite of Love\" - where a towering silver laser gun sends shafts of shimmering light ricocheting off the walls, ceilings and floors. But the big daddy of them all is the Royal Hall of Industries, which hosts a staggering 9,000 party-goers. Here the theme is red: \"Vegas is Burning\". Probably the greatest light show in the world, its 5,000 spots and lasers arc the colours of the rainbow flag across the dance floor. Just when you think nothing can top this, disco diva Dannii Minogue descends from the rafters on a sparkling silver crescent moon, belting out her chart-topping hits to the accompaniment of 20 drag queens, 70 dancers and incandescent pyrotechnics.

That's what they all said and, for the first half hour, climbing out of the upper Coquet valley on to the lumpy heather moorlands with only sheep for company, that was how it seemed. Then we realised that the dark cluster ahead of us was not a stray stand of conifers but a bunch of soldiers in camouflage gear. They turned out to be part of the Dutch army training on the Otterburn ranges at the southern end of the Northumberland National Park. They stayed with us for a couple of miles, chatting excitedly at the sight of all these hills and dales. A few hundred yards behind came half a dozen grim-looking instructors from the Parachute Regiment, their guns and radios a reminder that this was border country, always closely linked to warfare.</p> <p> The Romans built camps here before retreating behind Hadrian's Wall, and William the Conqueror marched back down the Coquet after giving the Scots a slap as a prelude to three centuries of raiding and skirmishing. We shook off our military escort at the border ridge where we turned north along the the last section of the Pennine Way, looking across at the Scottish lowlands under weak sun streaming here and there through banks of cloud. We passed the pile of rocks on the 2,000ft summit of Windy Gyle, named for a day like today with the breeze sharp enough to take your ears off. Now we were well clear of Otterburn, with its red flags and trudging squaddies, and it was indeed deserted and peaceful with fans of afternoon sunlight falling into the steep valleys. The hillsides were covered with the pale grass which brought the name of 'the white country' to the Cheviots, and each hidden valley had its dry-stone sheepfold, perfectly circular and beautifully constructed.</p> <p> Even the Norwegian spruce acquired an alluring turquoise tinge in the low light, and the only puzzle was a small flock of sheep in the village of Barrowburn with orange fleeces - not just the odd blob for identification, but a whole overcoat. The Cheviots are only one of three parts of Northumberland that offer fine walking routes, mostly neglected as people rush past to get to Scotland or go instead for the overcrowded dramas of the Lake District. The other two are the coast, and the central strip of hill and moorland country divided from the Cheviots by the River Till as it flows northwards to join the Tweed. 'The north-east suffers from the misconception that it's covered in slagheaps and coalmines,' says Ron Shaw, a retired tourism official who's helped develop walking in the region. 'That's only true of the bottom corner. The rest is the most unspoilt part of England. There are far more sheep than people.</p> <p>'Whichever way you go, there's not only delightful countryside but a wealth of interest since prehistoric times. And it's ideal walking country, especially on the coast.' In the Cheviots, it's mostly an in-between kind of walking, ideal for the time when you want more than a lowland amble but don't fancy getting your hands dirty on cold, hard rock. The mood is more spacious and reflective, the stride more relaxed and rhythmic, than in really mountainous areas such as Snowdonia, the Lake District and the Western Highlands of Scotland. The central crags and dales have wide views and a varied terrain while the warlike past has left more castles, fortalices, peles, bastles and barmikins than you can shake a stick at. </p> <p>But perhaps the greatest rewards are on the coast, where you can walk for miles along beaches and dunes with the sea air filling your lungs as the breakers roll lazily up the shelving, red-golden sand. The coast is a natural candidate for a waymarked, long-distance path, with all the brouhaha that would bring with it. But so far, fortunately, it hasn't happened and, apart from the last gasps of the Pennine Way, the main long-distance route in the county is the St Cuthbert's Way. </p> <p>This leads from Melrose, where the seventh- century saint began his ministry, to Holy Island, where he was buried and his followers later produced the Lindisfarne Gospels. Devised by Ron Shaw, it's a 62-mile route, covered comfortably in a week. There is a pub on Holy Island and, if you're cut off by the tide there, it just seems to stay open. Ten miles south, you come to the huge hilltop fortress of Bamburgh. The village has a cricket field below the battlements, several small baronial-style hotels, and a Grace Darling museum. She was the one who rescued nine shipwrecked sailors in an open boat in 1838, only to die of consumption at the age of 26. </p> <p>But perhaps the most spectacular castle is the ruin of Dunstanburgh, nine miles south of Bamburgh and three to the north of the little fishing village of Craster. It's hard to look at the gaunt silhouette without medieval cliches flooding into your head: the ring of sword striking helmet, trumpets sounding from the battlements, Mel Gibson rolling his eyes... My companion on the walk to Dunstanburgh was Carole Field, the local Liberal-Democrat councillor who runs a bed and breakfast in Beadnell, said to be the only east-coast port where the harbour actually faces west. We headed across the wide, damp sands of Embleton Bay, where the sand dunes behind the beach support an eccentric cluster of wooden shacks and bungalows staring out towards Norway.</p> <p> As we came closer to the fortified headland, the beach turned into a great, rough pavement of black boulders, just right for one of those catapults they used to break down castle walls. Carole was outlining a siege plan of 'more visitors for Northumberland, but no more development' - she's just beaten off a a caravan site application from the mighty estates of the Duke of Northumberland.</p> <p> 'And it's just not true that the weather's bad up here,' she said. 'We're on the dry side of the country and we have warmer summers now.'

      "bodyText": "Former Tottenham ace Mousa Saib headed an 85th-minute winner against Raja Casablanca to keep Saudi Arabia's Al-Nassr on track for an unlikely place in the final with a dramatic 4-3 victory in Group A last night. The result left Casablanca tumbling out of the competition in front of just a handful of spectators in the Morumbi Stadium. Al-Nassr opened the scoring after three minutes when Casablanca keeper Mustapha Chadili allowed Fuad Al-Amin's shot to squirm under his body at the near post. Casablanca equalised with an own goal from Al Nassr's Fahad Al Husseini, who nutmegged his keeper Mohammed Babkr Khojalli from Omar Nejjary's free-kick. Shortly afterwards, in a bizarre incident, Babkr Khojalli collapsed in a heap and after heated discussions with his team-mates, left the field in tears although the reason for his discomfort was unclear. Al-Nassr then took a two-goal lead within five minutes of the start of the second-half through Ahmed Bahja and Fahad Al Husseini. But Casablanca hit back through substitute Bouchaib El Moubarki after 67 minutes and four minutes later Talal El Karkouri equalised after Al-Nassr keeper Mahdi Al Dosari, who had replaced Babkr Khojalli, made a meal of his tame shot which squeezed through his fingers. The Moroccans were reduced to 10 men on 75 minutes when Youssef Safri was sent off. But in one further twist Saib, who has also played for Valencia and Auxerre, stooped to head the winner from a corner. Al-Nassr still have their work cut out to progress as they must beat local favourites Corinthians in their final match and hope Casablanca pick themselves up to deny victory to Real Madrid.",

      "body": "<p>Imagine Europe's capital cities lined up on a graph according to how self-satisfied they are. Paris, almost jealous of its own chic genius, heads the field at the far right. Lurking off the other end of the scale is Lisbon. For while it may mix lovely cafes and shabby old-world charm with breathtaking architecture, the refreshing aspect of what in Portuguese is called the 'white town' is that it can't really be bothered to shout about it.</p> <p> If you want to search out Lisbon's treasures, fine; if all you want to do is sip coffee while watching the world go by, that's fine, too. Lisbon is a city built for the ultra-relaxed, aimless fl3/4aneur, with its shuttered houses clad in beautiful blue and green tiling, and shimmering suddenly at the end of narrow streets a hilly vista of dusty red, blue and mustard rooftops, with the golden castle of Seao Jorge glowing atop one of the city's seven hills. Many buildings are in an advanced state of dilapidation: cats enjoy leisurely tongue-baths in the windows of overgrown empty stone houses. As Portugal's most celebrated poet, Fernando Pessoa, who lived nearly all his life in Lisbon, wrote: 'All is scattered, nothing entire./ O Portugal, fog you are...'</p> <p> The cutest example of Lisbon's rather lackadaisical attitude is the clanking, old, wrought-iron Elevador de Santa Justa, a 45m lift built in 1901 by a pupil of Gustav Eiffel to connect the west end of Baixa, the shopping district, with the Carmo church in Chiado. Unfortunately, the viaduct these days is closed, as the buildings on the hill are in danger of collapsing. So you buy a ticket and go up, and once you've done that, er, you go down again. It doesn't matter, though, because there is, surreally, a little cafe perched at the top, dispensing beverages against the ferocious wind and affording an impressive view of the city.</p> <p> The more practical downside of laid-back Lisbon is that you may well turn up to a museum only to find the main hall closed, or search out a cathedral cloister to find a messy web of scaffolding disfiguring the space. And be sure to avoid Lisbon if you're a lobster, as you will be piled into a restaurant window's tiny aquarium six deep among your suffering comrades, antennae futilely awaggle, with only the boiling pot to look forward to.</p> <p> Lisbon is a waterside city, but the shoreline is a dirty strip of pebbles, cut off from the conurbation by a choking motorway. The Atlantic is first and foremost the city's larder - bacalhau, the national dish of salt cod, or any number of grilled seabass, grouper and so on are the main fare in restaurants. Seen from a high vantage point, in fact, the precarious jumble of white and rosy buildings plonked up the hillside that constitutes Lisbon seems to be all a-huddle, a city at Europe's westernmost tip seeking consolation before the seas whose mastery was once its country's glory.</p> <p> Travellers to Lisbon should start the day like the Lisboetas do - shaking off cosmic-historical woes at a cafe. The celebrated Cafe A Brasileira is a Rua Garrett institution that has been serving short, strong coffees and pastries since 1905, and its green-and-gold facade invites the visitor into a narrow interior of carved dark wood, brass and mirrors. It was also a favourite hang-out of that man Pessoa, who is immortalised in a bronze statue outside, sitting forever at his regular table, dreaming up new poetries of metaphysics.</p> <p> Lisbon is also home to hundreds of cheaper, more rough-and-ready coffee shacks called pastelarias, after the mouthwatering collection of custard tarts and bite-sized sponge cakes that the natives seem to snack on obsessively. Choose one with the legend 'Fabrico Proprio' outside and you're assured that they bake the stuff on the premises.</p> <p> Once you're sufficiently jacked up on six espressos and a kilogram of cake, it's time to take a leisurely stroll to a sight or two. The great twin 12th-century castellated bell towers of Se Cathedral, hewn out of great blocks of sandstone punctuated by arrow slits, usher the visitor into a riot of dusty pink and gold High Catholic decor. From here, you can wander up steep lanes into the pretty Alfama residential district of tiny cobbled streets, stairways and gar dens, ducking under washing lines and stopping off to climb the dome of the Panteeao Nacional de Santa Engracia, a church dedicated to dead Portuguese heroes.</p> <p> The city's most obvious tourist destination is the Castelo de Seao Jorge itself, but apart from another view over the harbour, it's actually quite dull - and whatever you do, don't have lunch in the snooty and overpriced castle restaurant, whose mediocre food and attitude problem aren't even funny.</p> <p> For a real castle, head out for the day to the lush sub-tropical greenery of Sintra. Fifty minutes by train from Rossio station, this is where Byron began writing Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, famously calling the place 'glorious Eden'.</p> <p> Dominating Sintra's lower skyline is the 14th-century Palacio Nacional in the town centre, with its two enormous white chimneys. The dazzle of its lavishly-themed rooms, with tiles, gilt and ceiling paintings, may well have your stomach clamouring to keep up with your overfed eyes, and there's no shortage of little cafes across the way offering the local speciality cakes. Thus fortified, catch a bus up to the Moorish castle with endless vistas in all directions, is a magical experience.</p> <p> In the summer months, Lisbon is something of a dance mecca for tourists, with a slew of anonymous superclub villages spreading out around the docks. Once winter draws in, however, the evenings are best spent in the quirkier, cosier Bairro Alto, or 'high town', the original nightlife centre of Lisbon.</p> <p> Start around 8pm, pick a restaurant stuffed with well-fed locals and order fish: you can't go wrong. By about 10pm the bars have opened: everything from tiny one-room jazz shacks to clubby drum'n'bass joints with dancefloors.</p> <p> But to soak up Lisbon's true spirit of aesthetic melan choly, you should also reserve an evening to sample the Portuguese folk music, fado. This song style, named after the word for 'fate', supposedly derives from the homesick shanties of 16th-century Portuguese sailors: in its modern, more bohemian, urban incarnation it is a deliciously evocative mixture of lugubrious minor-key guitar rhythms and melodies with a distinctive Arabic weave.</p> <p> Make a night of it at the warm Clube do Fado, which boasts excellent food and wine and a stone-arched dining room. A leisurely meal is regularly interrupted as, under gloomy red candelight, local singers delight the aficionados with songs of passion and doom.</p> <p> While fado may be mournful, the end of each song characteristically sees the singer roused into an attitude of vig orous defiance. In Lisbon, life and the sea may be sorrowful, but the small things spread joy: a glass of cherry liqueur with the besuited old men in Rossio Square; an old-fashioned shoeshine among the scattered pigeons of Chiado; a sundowner at altitude, in the shadow of the gargoyles of Igreja da Graca.

He sounded entirely convincing - but, then, it's a long time since Mark was a beginner. Lesson Number One: they'll tell you it's easy - they lie.</p> <p> Our first morning on the hill - it is dreadfully uncool to call them mountains - was testament to this.

You'd be wrong.</p> <p> We began by strapping one foot to the board so tightly that, as my foot and lower leg began to numb, my eyes began in turn to bulge with excess blood. Through slightly blurred vision, I then attempted to stand up. Success and, for a second, I stupidly began to believe those 'it's easy' claims.</p> <p> There then followed an extremely tiring but hardly taxing period of walking stupidly around with a snowboard attached to one leg before we reached the bunny hill.</p> <p> There, the humiliation began in earnest. We started with side-slipping: this involves manoeuvring oneself, on an ice-laden 1-in-2 incline, from a seated position to fully balanced vertical on the pencil-thin edge of the board. Move a millimetre and you fall. I did. Repeatedly.</p> <p> The next morning we arrived at Lake Louise, where the turquoise of the glacier-fed lake was just beginning to break from its frozen intransigence. It was undoubtedly breathtaking - but I had more pressing things on my mind than scenery. Owing to my complete lack of snowboarding proficiency, I had been singled out along with a few other unfortunates for some personal attention. It was a bit like being the last person to be picked for playground games of football.</p> <p> Marc, our new instructor, had that ridiculous enthusiasm only found in North American males.

Hurt and humiliation at the same time. Boy this was fun.</p> <p> When, somewhat bruised, I eventually reached the top, something strange happened. I could stand up. Without falling. Then I could side-slip. Not elegantly, but backwards and forwards. It may not sound like much, but to me it was a miracle. Shortly after, the next snowboarding lesson arrived: the minute you can stand up, the real pain begins.</p> <p> Arrogantly buffered by an over-inflated pride in my modest achievements, I allowed myself to be hoodwinked into believing that now I should learn to turn. This involves shifting one's weight from the pencil-thin toe edge on to the pencil-thin heel edge, or vice-versa. While this sounds simple enough, successful completion in reality requires the agility of an under-fed Romanian acrobat coupled with the calf strength of an Eastern bloc weightlifter.</p> <p> The next few days are spent in a similar state of incompetence. But as we left Lake Louise and headed for Jasper, travelling along what is reputedly the world's most beautiful road, the realisation gradually dawned. Tomorrow was our last day. I had left Britain with one determination - by the end of the holiday I had to be able to get down a mountain.</p> <p> Len, our new instructor, looked as if he was wanted in 18 states. 'All right, it's time you guys learned to ride. Let's go,' he said pointing to the ski-lift. We were terrified. At the top, we were petrified. 'Let's ride,' said Len, before disappearing . And then we were all alone. The only way down was on a board.</p> <p> With the strains of Carmina Burana blasting in my head, I took off. Within a hundred yards, terminal velocity was approaching - I threw myself on to the succour of snow. It wasn't exactly merciful: bruised knees, a grazed nose and mild concussion.</p> <p> 'Hey dude,' said Rico, Len's Hispanic chum. 'Awesome. To fall like that, you gotta be enjoying it.' And, as I reached the bottom of my first hill, I had to grudgingly admit that I was.</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Canadian Airlines (0345 616767) flies to Calgary nine times a week from Heathrow.

Hurt and humiliation at the same time. Boy this was fun. When, somewhat bruised, I eventually reached the top, something strange happened. I could stand up. Without falling. Then I could side-slip. Not elegantly, but backwards and forwards. It may not sound like much, but to me it was a miracle. Shortly after, the next snowboarding lesson arrived: the minute you can stand up, the real pain begins. Arrogantly buffered by an over-inflated pride in my modest achievements, I allowed myself to be hoodwinked into believing that now I should learn to turn. This involves shifting one's weight from the pencil-thin toe edge on to the pencil-thin heel edge, or vice-versa. While this sounds simple enough, successful completion in reality requires the agility of an under-fed Romanian acrobat coupled with the calf strength of an Eastern bloc weightlifter. The next few days are spent in a similar state of incompetence. But as we left Lake Louise and headed for Jasper, travelling along what is reputedly the world's most beautiful road, the realisation gradually dawned. Tomorrow was our last day. I had left Britain with one determination - by the end of the holiday I had to be able to get down a mountain. Len, our new instructor, looked as if he was wanted in 18 states. 'All right, it's time you guys learned to ride. Let's go,' he said pointing to the ski-lift. We were terrified. At the top, we were petrified. 'Let's ride,' said Len, before disappearing . And then we were all alone. The only way down was on a board. With the strains of Carmina Burana blasting in my head, I took off. Within a hundred yards, terminal velocity was approaching - I threw myself on to the succour of snow. It wasn't exactly merciful: bruised knees, a grazed nose and mild concussion. 'Hey dude,' said Rico, Len's Hispanic chum. 'Awesome. To fall like that, you gotta be enjoying it.' And, as I reached the bottom of my first hill, I had to grudgingly admit that I was.

Before that, writers had \"booms\". The noisiest boom of the 1890s was caused by Trilby, a 3-vol melodrama about an artists' model fashioned into a superstar by a mesmerist, Svengali. Its succ\u00e8s fou astounded both author George du Maurier and publishers Osgood &amp; McIlvaine. The caution of the latter may be inferred from their advance of \u00a3500 against a 25 per cent royalty. </p> <p>The big boom of the 1990s, still booming, is JK Rowling's steady sequence of children's books about Harry Potter, the schoolboy wizard, and known to their publishers, Bloomsbury, as HP1, HP2 and HP3. (HP4 comes next June, the HP1 Warner film in 2001.) </p> <p>For the whole boiling, including fancy editions at \u00a318, and editions for adults (87,949 so far) who blush if seen with a children's book, the HP total is 4,159,884. In America, where Scholastic is the publisher, there are 17.7m copies in print of the three hardbacks plus HP1 paperback, which might mean 16m sold. I don't suppose Rowling is on a 25 per cent royalty (come back, Osgood &amp; McIlvaine). </p> <p>I took a seat at Bloomsbury with editorial director Liz Calder and colleague Minna Fry to see if we could discover some reason for such a phenomenon as Harry's success. \"Ros de la Haye,\" they said. \"Our children's marketing director. We hadn't read it, but she went on and on, wouldn't shut up, until we said 'Peace, we'll publish'.\" </p> <p>I asked other publishers to recall titles that caused similar reading frenzies. For Pan's marketing director Michael Halden, the culprit was Jaws. \"Our biggest success (and our greatest mistake. We were reprinting in tranches of 500,000, because the demand was too pacey to do less. We sold 4 million, put in another 500,000 reprint, and the market went suddenly flat.\" </p> <p>For Mark Barty-King, Transworld MD, the epiphanic moment was - well, actually, the 255 weeks that A Brief History of Time spent as a top-ten hardcover, 60 of them at Number One. \"It was the book you had to have and be seen to have. Reprinting every minute. 550,000.\" Meanwhile, Cookson went steaming on, unloading 80 million, sure as clogs go with shawls. </p> <p>Martin Neild, Hodder MD, remembers Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally as an unassuming bestseller, strolling along at 30,000 a year, not much affected by the Booker. But with the film, now called Schindler's List, it just went whiz! And not just whiz, it had legs. It trotted into motorway service stations, into Boots, and supermarkets before they'd heard of books. Of course, they've also sold 25 million of Stephen King's titles. </p> <p> MD Simon Master adds a hardback souvenir of recent date. In a year of discounting and further discounting, Thomas Harris's Silence of the Lambs follow-up Hannibal sold 656,001 copies, without benefit of club or other concessions. This kind of thing has a dire impact on other sales, he says, because your average person isn't going to buy more than one hardback in a year, and this was it. (Now it's Delia, the Margaret Patten of the 1990s, selling maybe a million.) </p> <p>John Grisham soldiers implacably on, Number One for the decade, 387,012 for his new hardback and the figures in this chart taking him over the 12 million. In America, Pelican Brief has done almost as many on its own, and his total for ten thrillers is computed at 60,742,288, with Stephen King second on 40,877,577. </p> <p>For much of the decade Maeve Binchy has Box-and-Coxed with Grisham at the top. She's more of a biennial but her novels are twice as long. Her publisher at Orion, Susan Lamb, has only had her for the last four, but they've done 4.5m. \"Maeve's your girl for a million,\" she says, \"though that huge export figure is due to Oprah.\" Everyone agrees that Oprah Winfrey herself is your girl for an instant boom. But Lamb is not happy with the discounting farrago, which she calls \"a buggers' muddle\". </p> <p>Nor is Philippa Harrison, CEO at Little, Brown. \"We've just come across a fascinating statistic: that for hardbacks the average price we received in 1994 was a penny more than the average we expect to receive in 2000.\" There's a risk that with front-of-store price-driven items catching the trade, and on-line bookshops offering 50 per cent off to win market share, customers will believe any title can be cheapened. \"They don't know,\" says MD David Young, \"whether the book's reduced because it's a wonder or a failure.\" </p> <p>But nothing deters juggernauts. Reviewers flayed Jilly Cooper's new novel, which promptly grew a new skin at Number One, with the hardback sale now 183,712. Similarly, HarperCollins MD Adrian Bourne has no fear that, with a wheel off, Jeffrey Archer will crash. \"Won't affect his next paperback one jot. If anyone can sell short stories it's Jeffrey.\" Historically this is true. In the last 20 years, among 2,000 titles in these fastseller lists, only seven were collections of short stories, two of them Archer's. </p> <p>Helen Fraser, MD at Penguin, is spoilt for choice. But Lady Chatterley's Lover imposes itself (even the book of the trial was a nice little earner. It did 2m in the six weeks before Christmas 1960, and 1.3m next year. And scads more since. But then look at the Penguin granary: 3,793,014 for Catcher in the Rye; 3,946,994 for 1984; 5,602,726 for Animal Farm... But Allen Lane acquired those. The satisfaction today is 679,270 for Alex Garland's The Beach, with the film imminent. And a clutch of \"city girl\" authors poised to fill the reading gap for 20-somethings, hitherto ignored. Most of all perhaps, Stalingrad, whose figures of 60,000 hardback and 243,870 trade paperback were unthinkable, she says, five years ago. </p> <p>This year 139 new paperbacks passed 100,000, ten more than the previous record of 1998, defying the feeling that you can only sell more of fewer books. Between them the top 100 sold 27,941,894 (up from 25.4m) for a return of \u00a3181.8m (up from \u00a3171.1m): for both years the money is notional -some 10 per cent might have to come off for discounts. The commonest price points are \u00a35.99 (59) and \u00a36.99 (25) - very little change. With few exceptions the format channelling is now orthodoxy: mass market into A, literary books into B, and original publication or high-profile authors with an extra edition into C, or trade paperback. </p> <p>The only new entrant to the first 25 is JK Rowling. The very British look of the list must partly account for the steady downward slant of the export percentage, from a regular 33 per cent in the early 90s, to 28 per cent last year, to 25 per cent this. The strength of the pound does a lot of damage. </p> <p>The proportion of women authors goes up. Throughout the 1980s it hardly varied from 25 per cent. In the 1990s it gradually rose, to a new high this year of 45, plus one joint authorship. The rash of new young \"city girl\" products promised for 2000 could even the balance. Mustn't forget though the new young \"town boy\" lot, from the \"post-Hornby generation\".</p>",

For much of the decade Maeve Binchy has Box-and-Coxed with Grisham at the top. She's more of a biennial but her novels are twice as long. Her publisher at Orion, Susan Lamb, has only had her for the last four, but they've done 4.5m. \"Maeve's your girl for a million,\" she says, \"though that huge export figure is due to Oprah.\" Everyone agrees that Oprah Winfrey herself is your girl for an instant boom. But Lamb is not happy with the discounting farrago, which she calls \"a buggers' muddle\". Nor is Philippa Harrison, CEO at Little, Brown. \"We've just come across a fascinating statistic: that for hardbacks the average price we received in 1994 was a penny more than the average we expect to receive in 2000.\" There's a risk that with front-of-store price-driven items catching the trade, and on-line bookshops offering 50 per cent off to win market share, customers will believe any title can be cheapened. \"They don't know,\" says MD David Young, \"whether the book's reduced because it's a wonder or a failure.\" But nothing deters juggernauts. Reviewers flayed Jilly Cooper's new novel, which promptly grew a new skin at Number One, with the hardback sale now 183,712. Similarly, HarperCollins MD Adrian Bourne has no fear that, with a wheel off, Jeffrey Archer will crash. \"Won't affect his next paperback one jot. If anyone can sell short stories it's Jeffrey.\" Historically this is true. In the last 20 years, among 2,000 titles in these fastseller lists, only seven were collections of short stories, two of them Archer's. Helen Fraser, MD at Penguin, is spoilt for choice. But Lady Chatterley's Lover imposes itself (even the book of the trial was a nice little earner. It did 2m in the six weeks before Christmas 1960, and 1.3m next year. And scads more since. But then look at the Penguin granary: 3,793,014 for Catcher in the Rye; 3,946,994 for 1984; 5,602,726 for Animal Farm... But Allen Lane acquired those. The satisfaction today is 679,270 for Alex Garland's The Beach, with the film imminent. And a clutch of \"city girl\" authors poised to fill the reading gap for 20-somethings, hitherto ignored. Most of all perhaps, Stalingrad, whose figures of 60,000 hardback and 243,870 trade paperback were unthinkable, she says, five years ago. This year 139 new paperbacks passed 100,000, ten more than the previous record of 1998, defying the feeling that you can only sell more of fewer books. Between them the top 100 sold 27,941,894 (up from 25.4m) for a return of \u00a3181.8m (up from \u00a3171.1m): for both years the money is notional -some 10 per cent might have to come off for discounts. The commonest price points are \u00a35.99 (59) and \u00a36.99 (25) - very little change. With few exceptions the format channelling is now orthodoxy: mass market into A, literary books into B, and original publication or high-profile authors with an extra edition into C, or trade paperback. The only new entrant to the first 25 is JK Rowling. The very British look of the list must partly account for the steady downward slant of the export percentage, from a regular 33 per cent in the early 90s, to 28 per cent last year, to 25 per cent this. The strength of the pound does a lot of damage. The proportion of women authors goes up. Throughout the 1980s it hardly varied from 25 per cent. In the 1990s it gradually rose, to a new high this year of 45, plus one joint authorship. The rash of new young \"city girl\" products promised for 2000 could even the balance. Mustn't forget though the new young \"town boy\" lot, from the \"post-Hornby generation\".",

The British historian, David Irving, who has been widely vilified for questioning whether 6m Jews were killed by the Nazis - and who believes that Hitler knew nothing of the Final Solution until late in the war - is suing an American academic for claiming that he is a \"Hitler partisan\" who twists history to cast the German dictator in a better light. Deborah Lipstadt, professor of modern Jewish and Holocaust studies at Emory university in Atlanta, Georgia, accused Mr Irving of being one of the most prominent and dangerous \"Holocaust deniers\" in the world in her book Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault On Truth and Memory, published by Penguin four years ago.

      "bodyText": "Neville Lawrence, father of the murdered black teenager Stephen, yesterday lodged a formal complaint against Scotland Yard after he was stopped and questioned about a street robbery. Officers also questioned Mr Lawrence about the ownership of the car he was in. Lawyers acting for Mr Lawrence have written to the police complaints authority saying that he was \"unlawfully stopped\" because the officers lacked reasonable grounds. The revelations are yet another public relations disaster for Scotland Yard over their treatment of black people. Police bungled the investigation into the stabbing of Stephen Lawrence partly because of \"institutional racism\" in the force, a public inquiry concluded last year. Mr Lawrence and his wife Doreen received awards and praise for their campaign for justice for their son Stephen, murdered in a racist attack at a bus stop in south London in April 1993. Mr Lawrence was stopped just after midnight on December 27, while travelling in his own car. He was leaving the Lisson Green estate in London with his cousin. Officers questioned the two men for between 15 and 20 minutes about a mugging that had happened on the estate 20 minutes earlier. Scotland Yard said that a woman told them that she had been robbed in the street of her mobile phone, credit cards and cash by two black men and that a description was then circulated. Scotland Yard declined to say how old the suspects were believed to be. Mr Lawrence is 57 and his cousin is in his 30s. Mr Lawrence is believed to have told officers where he had been all day. The two officers then questioned him about who owned the car he was in. Last month Mr Lawrence and Stephen's mother Doreen issued writs against 42 police officers involved in the investigation, including the outgoing commissioner, Sir Paul Condon. Suresh Grover of the monitoring group which campaigns against police harassment, said: \"It's disgusting that they stopped someone of Neville's stature for a robbery. It appears like harassment. It shows stop and search is arbitrary and racist.\" Richard Stone, a member of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry panel,said: \"If they had evidence of a man reasonably matching my description, then they are entitled to stop me, but if they didn't then I'd be very concerned. In a statement Scotland Yard said: \"Two police constables from Marylebone police station spoke to two men at approximately 12.50 on the morning of December 27, as they left an address in St John's Wood. \"They spoke to the men to see if they could provide information following a robbery which took place earlier in the St John's Wood area. While speaking to the men the officers clarified the ownership details of their car. The two men were not arrested and went on their way. \"We can confirm that the Met police has received a complaint alleging that two men were unlawfully stopped by police. The complaint is being investigated. No officers have been suspended.\"",

Though I've no idea about Poller's emotional and sexual life, he shares his hero's love of a fancy phrase and, you've guessed it, works in a bookshop.

Breznik writes without sentimentality about far-from-perfect lives and the coming of death. She is cool, but always humane, and through an unbroken stream of consciousness conveys a father and daughter relationship which, though cracked, is held together by an almost inexplicable affection. Breznik is a psychiatrist turned novelist and Night Duty is a beautiful elegy. </p> <p> <strong> The Knife Thrower</strong> <br> Steven Millhauser<br> (Phoenix, \u00a36.99) <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502357017,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> Small -own life is disturbed when its teenaged daughters take to nocturnal adventures in the woods not, as is revealed, for some black ritual but to escape from an all-knowing, entirely explicable world.

In the light of this evidence surely even sceptics should acknowledge the urgent need for further research in this field?</p> <p>Yours,<br> Patrick Holden,<br> Director, the Soil Association</p> <p><strong>Dear Patrick,</strong><br> The only difference between \"organic\" and conventional food is that organic food uses fewer synthetic chemicals. As a result, organic crops tend to have lower yields, so that more land must be used in their production for the same output and they are more expensive. To make up for this, organic farmers often use manure, which if improperly treated may contain high levels of the deadly bacterium E coli 0157:H7. Organic food is also more likely to perish during transport and storage because of a reluctance to use preservatives. Many organic enthusiasts justify their reluctance to use synthetic chemicals on the now discredited grounds that they are carcinogenic. It is true that rodents given high doses of certain synthetic pesticides contract cancer. But the same is true for about half of all chemicals, including many found naturally in foods such as broccoli and oranges. We survive because the human immune system is able to deal with low doses of carcinogens. </p> <p>Pesticide residues on food are not poisonous. The level of carcinogens from pesticides present in all the fruit and vegetables we consume in a year is approximately the same as the level of carcinogens in one cup of coffee. Fresh fruit and vegetables contain immune-boosting chemicals that enable us to fight cancer, so more cheap fresh fruit and vegetables improve our health regardless of the tiny amounts of pesticide residues that might remain.</p> <p>Yours, <br> Julian Morris,<br> Institute of Economic Affairs,<br> Editor, Fearing Food (Butterworth-Heinemann)<br></p> <p><strong>Dear Julian,</strong><br> I am surprised that your response manages to incorporate so many of the key misconceptions conventional scientists tend to make about organic farming. Your assertion that the only difference between organic and conventional food is the absence of synthetic chemicals misses the most important attribute of organic farming - that it promotes healthy plants and natural pest control.</p> <p>An organically farmed world might mean a little more land in agricultural production. But don't forget that wildlife and biodiversity can co-exist with organic farming - not the case with high-input intensive monocropping. You also have it wrong on manures. Organic standards only permit the use of manures from animals on the organic holding or brought-in manure from extensive farming systems, both of which must be thoroughly composted before use, virtually eliminating the risk of any pathogenic bacteria in the crops.</p> <p>The Environmental Protection Agency attributes 220,000 deaths a year to pesticide poisoning. Neither you nor I have any idea about what the long-term effect of consuming small traces of pesticides will be over decades, even in trace quantities. As for your last point, the latest research from Denmark suggests that organic production systems actually increase their presence, giving organic food stronger anti-cancer properties than its conventional equivalent.</p> <p>Yours,<br> Patrick</p> <p><strong>Dear Patrick,</strong><br> Talk about misconceptions. First, organic farmers do engage in artificial stimulation of growth and chemical suppression of disease. They use copper sulphate and lime, a pesticide that kills indiscriminately, and they stimulate with shit, which contains an assortment of unpleasant chemicals. Is it good enough \"virtually\" to eliminate bacteria through composting? And what about the 70% of organic food imported to the UK, much of it subject to less rigorous procedures than those of the Soil Association? Conventional farmers use a far broader array of chemical pesticides, many of which kill only a few target pests, and use fertilisers that target nutrient deficiencies without spreading disease.</p> <p>Second, there is more biological diversity in a few acres of wilderness than in a million square miles of organic cropland. Third, nobody has ever died as a result of consuming pesticide residues on food, nor are they likely to. According to the World Health Organisation, over 90% of pesticide deaths are suicides; a further 7% are the result of household poisoning; the remaining few are the result of careless application. Many foods contain far higher levels of toxic natural pesticides than anything added by man. </p> <p>Fourth, most studies have found no significant nutritional benefits from organic food; some have found the opposite. To adapt an old saying, \"manure in, manure out\".</p> <p>Yours,<br> Julian</p> <p><strong>Dear Julian,</strong><br> Your depiction of organic farming as entailing crude 19th-century practices is a serious distortion of the principles and practices which govern it. Surely the challenge confronting agriculture is to develop systems which produce healthy food, using a minimum of non-renewable inputs, and to do so without polluting, destroying wildlife, eroding soils or compromising food safety. Our contention is that organic farming is the best developed prescription which meets these objectives. The alternative is a brave new world of technologies with unquantifiable risks.</p> <p>However, your points still need a rebuttal: copper sulphate will be phased out of organic standards by 2003; lime is not a pesticide but a means of neutralising soil acidity; animal manures have acquired their \"unhealthy\" image largely because the bacteria and toxic residues they contain are the direct result of industrialised production; organic standards are remarkably consistent globally.</p> <p>Your advocacy of target-killing and fertilisers and the separation of food production from the preservation of biodiversity epitomises the current \"food factories and parks\" attitude that prevails in conventional science. This is the reverse of the organic philosophy. On your points about pesticide poisoning and food quality, we could trade further statistics on this but we have not yet had time to fully assess the effects of intensive farming on human health. What is beyond dispute is that more and more residues are finding a way into our food. Lady Eve Balfour, who founded the Soil Association in 1946, suggested that farmers should focus their attention on promoting what she called \"the causes of health\". She was right then and she still is today.</p> <p>Yours,<br> Patrick</p> <p><strong>Dear Patrick,</strong><br> Organic farming is less healthy and less sustainable then conventional agriculture. In most developed countries, age-corrected rates of death from nearly all cancers have been falling for the past 40 years. This in spite of widespread use of synthetic pesticides and fertiliser. The simple explanation is that they increase output, reducing the cost of fresh fruit and vegetables, which help protect against cancer. Forty years should surely be long enough to show a causal relationship between pesticide and cancer if one existed; yet none has been shown. With our relatively high incomes, you and I can spend a little more on our sprouts and potatoes and buy \"organic\" if we don't mind a bit of E coli, listeria, or aflatoxin. The vast majority, however, have no such luxury. For them, cheaper is better.</p>",

Yours, Patrick Holden, Director, the Soil Association Dear Patrick, The only difference between \"organic\" and conventional food is that organic food uses fewer synthetic chemicals. As a result, organic crops tend to have lower yields, so that more land must be used in their production for the same output and they are more expensive. To make up for this, organic farmers often use manure, which if improperly treated may contain high levels of the deadly bacterium E coli 0157:H7. Organic food is also more likely to perish during transport and storage because of a reluctance to use preservatives. Many organic enthusiasts justify their reluctance to use synthetic chemicals on the now discredited grounds that they are carcinogenic. It is true that rodents given high doses of certain synthetic pesticides contract cancer. But the same is true for about half of all chemicals, including many found naturally in foods such as broccoli and oranges. We survive because the human immune system is able to deal with low doses of carcinogens. Pesticide residues on food are not poisonous. The level of carcinogens from pesticides present in all the fruit and vegetables we consume in a year is approximately the same as the level of carcinogens in one cup of coffee. Fresh fruit and vegetables contain immune-boosting chemicals that enable us to fight cancer, so more cheap fresh fruit and vegetables improve our health regardless of the tiny amounts of pesticide residues that might remain. Yours, Julian Morris, Institute of Economic Affairs, Editor, Fearing Food (Butterworth-Heinemann) Dear Julian, I am surprised that your response manages to incorporate so many of the key misconceptions conventional scientists tend to make about organic farming. Your assertion that the only difference between organic and conventional food is the absence of synthetic chemicals misses the most important attribute of organic farming - that it promotes healthy plants and natural pest control. An organically farmed world might mean a little more land in agricultural production. But don't forget that wildlife and biodiversity can co-exist with organic farming - not the case with high-input intensive monocropping. You also have it wrong on manures. Organic standards only permit the use of manures from animals on the organic holding or brought-in manure from extensive farming systems, both of which must be thoroughly composted before use, virtually eliminating the risk of any pathogenic bacteria in the crops. The Environmental Protection Agency attributes 220,000 deaths a year to pesticide poisoning. Neither you nor I have any idea about what the long-term effect of consuming small traces of pesticides will be over decades, even in trace quantities. As for your last point, the latest research from Denmark suggests that organic production systems actually increase their presence, giving organic food stronger anti-cancer properties than its conventional equivalent. Yours, Patrick Dear Patrick, Talk about misconceptions. First, organic farmers do engage in artificial stimulation of growth and chemical suppression of disease. They use copper sulphate and lime, a pesticide that kills indiscriminately, and they stimulate with shit, which contains an assortment of unpleasant chemicals. Is it good enough \"virtually\" to eliminate bacteria through composting? And what about the 70% of organic food imported to the UK, much of it subject to less rigorous procedures than those of the Soil Association? Conventional farmers use a far broader array of chemical pesticides, many of which kill only a few target pests, and use fertilisers that target nutrient deficiencies without spreading disease. Second, there is more biological diversity in a few acres of wilderness than in a million square miles of organic cropland. Third, nobody has ever died as a result of consuming pesticide residues on food, nor are they likely to. According to the World Health Organisation, over 90% of pesticide deaths are suicides; a further 7% are the result of household poisoning; the remaining few are the result of careless application. Many foods contain far higher levels of toxic natural pesticides than anything added by man. Fourth, most studies have found no significant nutritional benefits from organic food; some have found the opposite. To adapt an old saying, \"manure in, manure out\". Yours, Julian Dear Julian, Your depiction of organic farming as entailing crude 19th-century practices is a serious distortion of the principles and practices which govern it. Surely the challenge confronting agriculture is to develop systems which produce healthy food, using a minimum of non-renewable inputs, and to do so without polluting, destroying wildlife, eroding soils or compromising food safety. Our contention is that organic farming is the best developed prescription which meets these objectives. The alternative is a brave new world of technologies with unquantifiable risks. However, your points still need a rebuttal: copper sulphate will be phased out of organic standards by 2003; lime is not a pesticide but a means of neutralising soil acidity; animal manures have acquired their \"unhealthy\" image largely because the bacteria and toxic residues they contain are the direct result of industrialised production; organic standards are remarkably consistent globally. Your advocacy of target-killing and fertilisers and the separation of food production from the preservation of biodiversity epitomises the current \"food factories and parks\" attitude that prevails in conventional science. This is the reverse of the organic philosophy. On your points about pesticide poisoning and food quality, we could trade further statistics on this but we have not yet had time to fully assess the effects of intensive farming on human health. What is beyond dispute is that more and more residues are finding a way into our food. Lady Eve Balfour, who founded the Soil Association in 1946, suggested that farmers should focus their attention on promoting what she called \"the causes of health\". She was right then and she still is today. Yours, Patrick Dear Patrick, Organic farming is less healthy and less sustainable then conventional agriculture. In most developed countries, age-corrected rates of death from nearly all cancers have been falling for the past 40 years. This in spite of widespread use of synthetic pesticides and fertiliser. The simple explanation is that they increase output, reducing the cost of fresh fruit and vegetables, which help protect against cancer. Forty years should surely be long enough to show a causal relationship between pesticide and cancer if one existed; yet none has been shown. With our relatively high incomes, you and I can spend a little more on our sprouts and potatoes and buy \"organic\" if we don't mind a bit of E coli, listeria, or aflatoxin. The vast majority, however, have no such luxury. For them, cheaper is better.",

Ask the fund manager for a performance check based on discrete one-year periods. Any fund in this state is unlikely to make even a modestly respectable return over long periods. So, unless the managers have been sacked and replaced by brighter people, ditch it. Resolve to make the first \u00a37,000 of any new investment - or money freed up by switching from a useless fund manager - into an individual savings account. Go for a maxi-Isa if you have more than \u00a33,000. The initial tax saving is not large but it should build up over time. Unlike personal equity plans, Isas can also be invested worldwide. Your credit card * Slash the interest bill Paying an annual fee is \u00a310 to \u00a315 a year down the drain. And going for a high interest level card that offers loyalty gifts is a waste of time if you fail to pay off your monthly bill just once or twice a year. Many cards offer low rates for a fixed period, according to Moneyfacts. But several allow the concession only on balance transfers - you will have to pay the full whack on new purchases. Some are no-strings offers: Tesco charges 4.9% on goods and services until January 2001; RBS Advanta weighs in at 5.8% until July; People's Bank's rate is 5.9% for six months; MBNA's level is 6.5% for six months; Direct Line is 6.8% during the first six months of issue. And Capital One has a long term 11.9% rate. It's not so easy to change a personal loan - there are penalties for early redemption. But make sure that any new loan is one of the best on the market rather than simply the package your bank wants to sell. Good deals on \u00a33,000 loans come from Co-op Bank, Frizzell Bank, Leek United, People's Bank, Sainsbury's and Tesco. Your tax bill * Avoid unnecessary payments Tax guru John Battersby at accountants KPMG suggests: Sending in your self-assessment tax form as soon as possible - there's an automatic \u00a3100 fine after the end of this month; Checking whether you would be better off with extra salary rather than a company car; Splitting assets with a lower paid spouse to cut tax on savings and investment income - it works if one of a married couple pays tax at a lower rate than the partner; Delaying any sale of a business until the new tax year in April as capital gains tax rules could be eased Helping those less fortunate with a tax-saving charitable donation. Gift Aid, which applies to all good causes, has a \u00a3250 minimum while Millennium Gift Aid, which goes to anti-poverty and education projects in 80 of the poorest countries, starts at \u00a3100. And finally... You can replenish your booze stocks with a day trip to France. But unless you really enjoy a day in a Calais supermarket car park, don't forget to calculate your petrol, ferry fares - and the value of your time.",

The Latvian consul general in Australia, Emils Delins, said yesterday the foreign affairs department in Riga had asked his office to examine the Australian files on Kalejs to see if there were grounds for having him extradited for crimes committed on Latvian soil. The new investigation has been prompted by the flurry of publicity over the Kalejs case in Britain in the past fortnight. \"We want to know on what information these publications were based and what the crimes supposedly committed by Kalejs were,\" Ms Subrovska said. The move followed a visit to Riga by Tom Lantos, the US Democratic congressman and Holocaust survivor who is a leading lobbyist on war crimes issues. \"I have every expectation, having talked to the [Latvian] president, the prime minister, the foreign minister and others, that the Latvian government will proceed with full speed and determination,\" Mr Lantos, a native Hungarian, told the BBC.

The County Championship no longer provides enough excitement, and there is no need for the three one-day competitions that will be in place this summer after the absurd reintroduction of the Benson and Hedges Cup.</p> <p>Instead, we should be aiming for a streamlined system where the top players in the country play a relatively small amount of four- and one-day games, and are allowed plenty of time to develop their game in practice sessions. This option may leave county members with less cricket for their money, and this may mean that, as a proposal, it would probably be rejected by the counties. No matter. They must learn to see past their selfish view-points and recognise the good such changes would do for the national game. After all, that is what their prime focus should be. </p> <p>If the counties need further persuading, then they should look no further than our arch-rivals. Australia, it is safe to say, are the best in the world at both forms of cricket, but this is not because they have a larger pool of talent to call upon (the UK's population is three times the size).</p> <p>It is instead because of their system of domestic cricket.

      "bodyText": "I know it's been said a number of times before, but English cricket is in dire need of a change. The County Championship no longer provides enough excitement, and there is no need for the three one-day competitions that will be in place this summer after the absurd reintroduction of the Benson and Hedges Cup. Instead, we should be aiming for a streamlined system where the top players in the country play a relatively small amount of four- and one-day games, and are allowed plenty of time to develop their game in practice sessions. This option may leave county members with less cricket for their money, and this may mean that, as a proposal, it would probably be rejected by the counties. No matter. They must learn to see past their selfish view-points and recognise the good such changes would do for the national game. After all, that is what their prime focus should be. If the counties need further persuading, then they should look no further than our arch-rivals. Australia, it is safe to say, are the best in the world at both forms of cricket, but this is not because they have a larger pool of talent to call upon (the UK's population is three times the size). It is instead because of their system of domestic cricket. The Pura Milk Cup promotes intense competition and an extremely high standard of play. This is not only because players are desperate to get into the national side, but they are also never really assured of their place in the state side. And much less cricket is played per season than in England. It is this system that has produced players like Steve Waugh and Glenn McGrath, who consistently perform on the international stage.

After that, electronic sales collapsed to a level lower than normal while ordinary bookshop trade surged ahead. The sales pattern emerges from the first market research to compare the two sectors of the book trade in their peak pre-Christmas season, when they do more than a quarter of their yearly business. Net companies have until now been highly secretive about sales figures.

      "body": "<p>I took my family to the Dome this week (yes, we paid the full entry fee, which at less than \u00a358 for a family ticket is remarkable value) and I don't mind admitting it, I enjoyed the day out very much. We all did. We might even go again. </p> <p>I know this will make me a pariah among many people, including my colleagues. But there's something weirdly British about the way everything in our national life has to be either a complete catastrophe or an international triumph. The Dome isn't either. It could be better, but it could be an awful lot worse. </p> <p>If we created the thing to make the rest of the world envious, that was a stupid thing to do. And if we're now cringing with shame because the rest of the world doesn't even notice, that's a mistake as well. I might ponder before taking an overnight bus journey from Aberdeen, but living in west London, I thought it was well worthwhile. Vaut le voyage, as the French say. </p> <p>We went, with two of the children's friends, on Monday. Our journey by tube was smooth and speedy and we were walking into the Dome 15 minutes before it was supposed to open. The first thing that hits you is the sheer, outrageous size of the structure. The nearest I've seen is the Boeing hangar in Seattle where they assemble 747s, but there's less fun for children there. </p> <p>Everywhere you look, every angle, offers some new extraordinary vista. The juxtaposition of the modern, the old, the angular and the plain weird, all in the boldest colours, gives the thing a dreamlike feel; as, for example, a woman dressed as a Venetian mummer on stilts walking past one of the great yellow struts. </p> <p>With one exception, the staff were pleasant in a genuinely friendly way, without the tense, I'm-being-nice-to-you-because-my-livelihood-depends-on-it manner you get at Disney parks. Within two minutes, the children were in the millennium timekeepers' zone, firing foam tennis balls through guns at each other and everyone else. </p> <p>We enjoyed the journey zone, with its mocked-up high-speed train cabin and models of future cars, bikes, planes etc, and even the living island zone, which is terribly preachy about the environment. You get to play seaside arcade games free, though I don't think that shooting the balls into a jokey dustbin will convince children that they must spend their lives recycling. </p> <p>The Gerald Scarfe statues in the self-portrait zone are quite sensational and cut against the self-congratulatory message of the exhibits around them. His thug, racist and couch potato are far more disturbing than any number of pickled sharks, and if the burden, with its gasping taxpayer suffering under the weight of fat cats, politicians, bishops and judges, looks like an old Pravda cartoon, it's very powerful for all that. </p> <p>The children loved morphing; you sit in front of a computer screen and can see how you would look as a member of the opposite sex, or a different race or in 20 years' time. They liked the giant table football in the word and learning zone, and we all enjoyed the rest zone, a giant pod like a three-dimensional figure-of-eight, in which you lie on white concrete as strange pastel colours and new age windy-music type sounds wash all over you. Sounds boring but is hypnotic. </p> <p>Nearly all the queues were short or non-existent. We waited less than 10 minutes to get into the planet zone, a somewhat lost opportunity, since the ride, a space ship journey to earth, begins excitingly and ends with a dreary film of people (\"6 bn faces, but only one heart\") including plenty of ethnic minorities and paraplegic basketball players. Fine, but more like a BA commercial than a journey into our global psyche. </p> <p>There are failings, some very British. Too many things had broken down even by day three. There's too much litter, and I noticed that a spilled cup of soup hadn't been cleared up after 10 minutes. It suffers from the modern British curse of trendy design, which allows precious, stressy design people to lord it over content. (\"Oh, no, you can't possibly tell people what part of the body they're in, \"I imagine them saying, \"it would completely spoil the concept!\") Actually, you can avoid the body zone queue by not joining it; the zone, apart from the thundering heart, isn't much good anyway. </p> <p>The show in the central arena is a meaningless bit of ponderous, metaphorical sci-fi which would have been appropriate in France, but not here. However, it is very spectacular and we watched with pleasure. The trouble is that as people leave they can accidentally get caught up with the queues for the body zone, which we did, leading one attendant to react in a way which might have been apt if he'd caught me urinating on the crowds below. I feared he was about to have a cardiac arrest. </p> <p>Advice: I would leave early to get there, and if you possibly can, take your own food. Do a bit of planning first. Ignore the body and head straight for work and learning. Take it easy and don't expect to do it all. Queues are shorter while the show is on in the main arena. </p> <p>As it is we spent eight full hours there, and the main complaint from our offspring and their friends was that we hadn't had time to see it all. No, it isn't Disneyland and it is awfully didactic, but it's convenient, remarkable value and plenty of fun. </p> <p>\u0095 A year ago I pointed out that the millennium bug was a psychological problem rather than a real one. I said: \"My guess is that on January 2 we'll be bored out of our skulls and desperate to get back to work,\" which was clearly not true, but at least got closer than those people who envisaged wild, feral gangs roaming through the streets stealing the last crust from starving pensioners, while total chaos drove us back into the Dark Ages, but without the erudite sophistication. </p> <p>Of course, we now have other horrors to worry about. We seem to need a looming disaster, preferably one we can blame on ourselves, such as global warming. It was interesting that the moment the millennium bug had vanished in a puff of smoke, up popped the asteroid which is about to wipe out human life, and the Ebola virus, which will do the same thing, only slower. </p> <p>\u0095 I should have written before to thank you for all the letters about cyclists. I was reminded of them the other day, walking near Oxford Street, when a maniac with helmet and drop handlebars failed to signal and scorched round a corner, almost taking my feet off. Did he stop to apologise? Of course not; he was a cyclist and thus was beyond criticism. </p> <p>Several older people wrote to say how terrified they were of walking down pavements while cyclists bear down on them, sometimes graciously ringing a bell to warn that they have two seconds to get out of the way. There were some letters disagreeing, too, but they were mostly in pious cyclist-speak, so I binned them.</p>",

And if we're now cringing with shame because the rest of the world doesn't even notice, that's a mistake as well. I might ponder before taking an overnight bus journey from Aberdeen, but living in west London, I thought it was well worthwhile. Vaut le voyage, as the French say. We went, with two of the children's friends, on Monday. Our journey by tube was smooth and speedy and we were walking into the Dome 15 minutes before it was supposed to open. The first thing that hits you is the sheer, outrageous size of the structure. The nearest I've seen is the Boeing hangar in Seattle where they assemble 747s, but there's less fun for children there. Everywhere you look, every angle, offers some new extraordinary vista. The juxtaposition of the modern, the old, the angular and the plain weird, all in the boldest colours, gives the thing a dreamlike feel; as, for example, a woman dressed as a Venetian mummer on stilts walking past one of the great yellow struts. With one exception, the staff were pleasant in a genuinely friendly way, without the tense, I'm-being-nice-to-you-because-my-livelihood-depends-on-it manner you get at Disney parks. Within two minutes, the children were in the millennium timekeepers' zone, firing foam tennis balls through guns at each other and everyone else. We enjoyed the journey zone, with its mocked-up high-speed train cabin and models of future cars, bikes, planes etc, and even the living island zone, which is terribly preachy about the environment. You get to play seaside arcade games free, though I don't think that shooting the balls into a jokey dustbin will convince children that they must spend their lives recycling. The Gerald Scarfe statues in the self-portrait zone are quite sensational and cut against the self-congratulatory message of the exhibits around them. His thug, racist and couch potato are far more disturbing than any number of pickled sharks, and if the burden, with its gasping taxpayer suffering under the weight of fat cats, politicians, bishops and judges, looks like an old Pravda cartoon, it's very powerful for all that. The children loved morphing; you sit in front of a computer screen and can see how you would look as a member of the opposite sex, or a different race or in 20 years' time. They liked the giant table football in the word and learning zone, and we all enjoyed the rest zone, a giant pod like a three-dimensional figure-of-eight, in which you lie on white concrete as strange pastel colours and new age windy-music type sounds wash all over you. Sounds boring but is hypnotic. Nearly all the queues were short or non-existent. We waited less than 10 minutes to get into the planet zone, a somewhat lost opportunity, since the ride, a space ship journey to earth, begins excitingly and ends with a dreary film of people (\"6 bn faces, but only one heart\") including plenty of ethnic minorities and paraplegic basketball players. Fine, but more like a BA commercial than a journey into our global psyche. There are failings, some very British. Too many things had broken down even by day three. There's too much litter, and I noticed that a spilled cup of soup hadn't been cleared up after 10 minutes. It suffers from the modern British curse of trendy design, which allows precious, stressy design people to lord it over content. (\"Oh, no, you can't possibly tell people what part of the body they're in, \"I imagine them saying, \"it would completely spoil the concept!\") Actually, you can avoid the body zone queue by not joining it; the zone, apart from the thundering heart, isn't much good anyway. The show in the central arena is a meaningless bit of ponderous, metaphorical sci-fi which would have been appropriate in France, but not here. However, it is very spectacular and we watched with pleasure. The trouble is that as people leave they can accidentally get caught up with the queues for the body zone, which we did, leading one attendant to react in a way which might have been apt if he'd caught me urinating on the crowds below. I feared he was about to have a cardiac arrest. Advice: I would leave early to get there, and if you possibly can, take your own food. Do a bit of planning first. Ignore the body and head straight for work and learning. Take it easy and don't expect to do it all. Queues are shorter while the show is on in the main arena. As it is we spent eight full hours there, and the main complaint from our offspring and their friends was that we hadn't had time to see it all. No, it isn't Disneyland and it is awfully didactic, but it's convenient, remarkable value and plenty of fun. \u0095 A year ago I pointed out that the millennium bug was a psychological problem rather than a real one. I said: \"My guess is that on January 2 we'll be bored out of our skulls and desperate to get back to work,\" which was clearly not true, but at least got closer than those people who envisaged wild, feral gangs roaming through the streets stealing the last crust from starving pensioners, while total chaos drove us back into the Dark Ages, but without the erudite sophistication. Of course, we now have other horrors to worry about. We seem to need a looming disaster, preferably one we can blame on ourselves, such as global warming. It was interesting that the moment the millennium bug had vanished in a puff of smoke, up popped the asteroid which is about to wipe out human life, and the Ebola virus, which will do the same thing, only slower. \u0095 I should have written before to thank you for all the letters about cyclists. I was reminded of them the other day, walking near Oxford Street, when a maniac with helmet and drop handlebars failed to signal and scorched round a corner, almost taking my feet off. Did he stop to apologise? Of course not; he was a cyclist and thus was beyond criticism. Several older people wrote to say how terrified they were of walking down pavements while cyclists bear down on them, sometimes graciously ringing a bell to warn that they have two seconds to get out of the way. There were some letters disagreeing, too, but they were mostly in pious cyclist-speak, so I binned them.",

Average negotiators know what their own side's bottom line is: good negotiators are aware of the bottom line of the other side. The US failed to appreciate the depth of feeling among developing countries, heartily sick of being ignored and pushed around. The final straw came when the Americans, seeking an interpreter for an impromptu meeting on labour rights, removed the translator from a meeting of African countries and then turned off the microphones. This may one day feature in management manuals as the epitome of \"how not to do it\". Faced with this catalogue of structural weaknesses and tactical errors, it was little wonder that the talks ended as they did. But next time - assuming there is a next time - will be just as bad unless some basic management skills are brought to bear. Larry Elliott is the Guardian's economics editor",

      "bodyText": "Britain is moving towards normal relations with Pakistan next week after being one of the most outspoken critics of its military coup that overthrew an unpopular elected government last October. The overture comes at a sensitive time, with relations between Pakistan and India strained over the hijack of an Indian plane last month. The man being deputed to talk to the military-controlled administration in Islamabad is Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the British defence staff, who starts a three-day visit to Pakistan on Thursday. It is rare for a military man to be used for such a diplomatic role but during the conflicts with Iraq and Serbia in the course of the 90s Sir Charles became close to British ministers. He has been delegated to discuss with the leader of the October 12 coup, General Pervez Musharraf, the prospects for return to democracy and ways to reduce tension with India. The Pakistan-India dispute over Kashmir is seen by the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, as one of the most dangerous flashpoints in the world. Both states have nuclear devices - though their ability to deliver them to a remote target is uncertain - but the more immediate worry is terrorism. The emotional heat generated by the issue of Kashmir's status has led to the murders of foreign visitors in Kashmir and December's hijack of the Indian airliner carrying 155 people. One passenger was killed by the hijackers, who supported Pakistan's claim to Kashmir. The foreign office hopes that Sir Charles's visit will not ruffle feathers in India. Stephen Byers, Britain's secretary of state for trade and industry, briefed the Indian foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, in Delhi yesterday, telling him that the defence chief will deliver a blunt message to Gen Musharraf. The foreign office said it was not backtracking on its criticism of the coup but was seeking to nudge Pakistan towards setting a timetable for a return to democracy. The coup ousted Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, who now faces a show trial. If Pakistan moves towards democracy, Britain is offering to help it reform institutions such as its police and judiciary. The foreign office also wants to encourage Pakistan and India to resume talks over the future of Kashmir. The Muslim-majority state is claimed by Pakistan but ruled by India, which has never held a promised referendum to ascertain what Kashmir's people would prefer. Peter Hain, the foreign office minister, said: \"It is absolutely vital that Pakistan be a stable country rather than a haven for terrorists, source for regional insecurity and threat to neighbouring countries or base for Islamic extremism.\" He added: \"This is not a return to business as usual. Speaking as one military man to another, Charlies Guthrie will be making clear to Gen Musharraf that Britain does not approve of military coups and wants to see an irreversible time frame for a return to democracy.\" Right after Gen Musharraf took over, Mr Cook said that no coup was acceptable. If the west accepts a coup in one country, he believes, it will encourage disaffected officers elsewhere. Mr Cook took a lead in persuading Commonwealth leaders in November to make clear their unease by suspending Pakistan from all Commonwealth bodies, though they stopped short of expulsion. Discussions between Pakistan and Britain on economic aid were also frozen. But the US, after initially condemning the coup, softened its line, seeing Gen Musharraf as in many ways preferable to Mr Sharif, whose government was widely accused of corruption. Britain retains influence in Pakistan through direct aid, European Union aid and significant arms sales. Arms sales continued after coup. A British government spokesman said yesterday that each arms licence is examined on merit and that Pakistan had legitimate defence interests. Sir Charles will press Pakistan to sign the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. He will also urge the leadership to ensure that Mr Sharif will not face a show trial but one that is open and fair. He is being held on charges of attempted murder for allegedly trying to prevent the landing of a plane carrying Gen Musharraf back to Pakistan just before the coup. But more charges are almost certain as a big corruption investigation is proceeding against the former prime minister and his entourage.",

      "body": "<p>Wheee! That's all over, then. It's safe to dive back into the airwaves. No sucker's going to play the wretched 1999 ever again, and a good thing, too. Of all the times Prince has shown us that not every black musician has rhythm, soul and grace (he, like Jimi Hendrix, was the black musician of his decade for people who don't like black music), that lumbering piece of pedantry was the worst. Hopefully, too, we've seen the back of Pulp's Disco 2000, which is not the Greatest Living Englishman's finest moment, though it's still better than 99% of the swill that passes for classic pop. </p> <p>People always tell you about the Wonder Years and the Difficult Years, but they never tell you about the Stupid Years until it's too late. Every supposedly sinister year that a bunch of middle-class male tossers have been warning each other about for ages just comes and goes, leaving the alarmists with a right royal egg on their faces. For instance, I always thought George Orwell was a right-wing, public-school Commie-baiter, so it had a certain bitter poetry to it that, when 1984 actually arrived, it was in the midst of Mrs Thatcher's dismantling of the state and denationalisation of its industry. It was too much freedom, not too much regimentation, that made this a country fit for fat cats - a bit of Big Brother wouldn't have gone amiss. The year got the songs it deserved, too, which are thankfully never aired these days: 1984 by a) David Bowie (\"Beware the savage jaw/Of nineteen eighty fawww!\") and b) the Eurythmics (\"Sex crime/Sex cri-cri-crime/Sex crime/ Nine-teen-eighty-four!\") </p> <p>A year from now, there's bound to be a temporary hiccup when the men of the chattering classes won't be able to resist a bit of pontificating along the lines of \"2001: A Space Odyssey Or Oddity?\", but I don't think people are too interested in space now that they've got the internet. Space wasn't just the final frontier, it was where all the spare men could go and get laid by Martian women too daft to know better. Now, they can go into a chatroom as a 6ft Aussie surfer called Hot Stuff and do the deed - sort of. </p> <p>The next big year will be 2525, as immortalised in the late 60s by one-hit wonders Zager &amp; Evans. You just wait: slews of newsprint will be given over to the likes of Paul Johnson (against) and Andrew Marr (for) debating whether we will, as Zager &amp; Evans predicted, \"pick our sons, and pick our daughters, too, from the bottom of a long glass tube\".

      "bodyText": "Wheee! That's all over, then. It's safe to dive back into the airwaves. No sucker's going to play the wretched 1999 ever again, and a good thing, too. Of all the times Prince has shown us that not every black musician has rhythm, soul and grace (he, like Jimi Hendrix, was the black musician of his decade for people who don't like black music), that lumbering piece of pedantry was the worst. Hopefully, too, we've seen the back of Pulp's Disco 2000, which is not the Greatest Living Englishman's finest moment, though it's still better than 99% of the swill that passes for classic pop. People always tell you about the Wonder Years and the Difficult Years, but they never tell you about the Stupid Years until it's too late. Every supposedly sinister year that a bunch of middle-class male tossers have been warning each other about for ages just comes and goes, leaving the alarmists with a right royal egg on their faces. For instance, I always thought George Orwell was a right-wing, public-school Commie-baiter, so it had a certain bitter poetry to it that, when 1984 actually arrived, it was in the midst of Mrs Thatcher's dismantling of the state and denationalisation of its industry. It was too much freedom, not too much regimentation, that made this a country fit for fat cats - a bit of Big Brother wouldn't have gone amiss. The year got the songs it deserved, too, which are thankfully never aired these days: 1984 by a) David Bowie (\"Beware the savage jaw/Of nineteen eighty fawww!\") and b) the Eurythmics (\"Sex crime/Sex cri-cri-crime/Sex crime/ Nine-teen-eighty-four!\") A year from now, there's bound to be a temporary hiccup when the men of the chattering classes won't be able to resist a bit of pontificating along the lines of \"2001: A Space Odyssey Or Oddity?\", but I don't think people are too interested in space now that they've got the internet. Space wasn't just the final frontier, it was where all the spare men could go and get laid by Martian women too daft to know better. Now, they can go into a chatroom as a 6ft Aussie surfer called Hot Stuff and do the deed - sort of. The next big year will be 2525, as immortalised in the late 60s by one-hit wonders Zager &amp; Evans. You just wait: slews of newsprint will be given over to the likes of Paul Johnson (against) and Andrew Marr (for) debating whether we will, as Zager &amp; Evans predicted, \"pick our sons, and pick our daughters, too, from the bottom of a long glass tube\". Will everything we \"think, do and say be in the pill we took today\"? If so, we \"won't have a thing to chew\"; furthermore, \"nobody's going to look at you\". The jury's still out on whether or not your arms will be \"hanging limp by your sides\" and \"your hands have nothing to do\" because \"some machine's doing it for you\".

      "body": "<p>We're back in spin-off land. Will Angel (Sky 1) be to Buffy the Vampire Slayer what Rhoda was to the Mary Tyler Moore Show? Or will it be George and Mildred to Man About the House? Ah, Yootha Joyce, sad-eyed lady of the comedy lowlands, where did it all go wrong? </p> <p>Younger readers who have spent the last paragraph rolling their eyes skywards and wondering whether it's really true that there ain't no party like an S Club party can rejoin us now. </p> <p>You remember Angel. He was the one with the big black coat, a full set of strap-on wristbands, about 55 well-filled black singlets and a vast, empty canvas for a forehead. He was also a recovering vampire, seducing little Buffy with his eternal charms. </p> <p>Just a note about that forehead: it was created by Angel over a period of perhaps 200 years by lowering his eyebrows severely as he sank his fangs into his food. But after his blood-sucking days came to an end (a gypsy curse filled the vampire with all-too-human remorse for his nocturnal life of mass murder, as it would), his face stayed in that comely way. It made him look, like, deep. Boys, if you want to delay the ladies with your brooding, gothic charm as Angel does, practise pulling down your eyebrows in front of a mirror. That's the way - and the other eyebrow. Now you're cooking! This, of course, is something Angel can't do. Vampires, even recovering ones, I am reliably told, don't use mirrors. </p> <p>The premise for this spin-off was that Angel had to leave Sunnydale and lovely Buffy. But why? This, frankly, is where it gets weird. Every time Angel achieved what the script coyly referred to as \"perfect happiness\" with Buffy, he became a vampire and needed an immediate transfusion of blood from whichever human was nearest. Which can be a trial for a girl already coming to terms with post-coital tristesse. And also for a boy, I should imagine, who finds himself mutating inopportunely. </p> <p>In terms of the special effects, this mutation involved Angel's forehead becoming artfully filled with swollen vampire brows at what we shall laughingly call the key moment. He thereby became a dead ringer for those aliens in Deep Space Nine. You know, the chaps who throng the bridge of the new starship and look as though they have forgotten more about tele-transporting and inter-galactic engineering than Scotty ever knew. Once it was pointy ears; now the special- effects johnnies suggest alien species by appliqu\u00e9ing plastic brows to foreheads. And this, we are meant to believe, is progress in the representation of non-human life forms. I mean, really. </p> <p>Angel moved to LA to atone for his sins, to mourn the loss of Buffy, to forget about that California high- school schtick and become an adult. Or as adult as a dark destroyer of evil in an evil town can be. \"He's a shadow,\" some joker mentioned to set this pilot episode in its proper context, \"a faceless champion of the hapless human race.\" Well, yes, though hardly faceless. Another angel in a city of fallen... oh, you know the drill. </p> <p>The first hapless one was Tina, a waitress, menaced by someone called Russell. In my experience, admittedly limited, Tinas rarely get it on in untroubled fashion with Russells. And so it was in this case. \"Russell likes pain,\" said Tina, in a chilling modulation of the normal light-hearted mood. \"He really does. He talks about it like it's a friend. And you don't leave him. He leaves you when he's had enough.\" After she was killed, Angel set about getting medieval on Russell's bottom. Which was only fair. </p> <p>Will this spin-off work? Angel is hardly the most interesting of the Buffy ensemble. As if in recognition of this fact, the creators have brought along Cordelia, that vacuous, glamorous graduate of Sunnydale High, to be Cybill Shepherd to his Bruce Willis. Cordelia is in LA trying to make it as an actress and living in Malibu. \"A small condo on the beach,\" she told glowering Angel. \"Not a private beach, but I'm young, so I forbear.\" As in Buffy, there is fancifully eloquent writing by Joss Whedon, expanding the teenage Californian vocabulary massively and unexpectedly. Only occasionally does it collapse into solecism (\"Forbear\"? I think not). </p> <p>But the stage is set for an appealing series. Angel will fight evil and Cordelia will be the decorous comedy foil and rather more human than he could ever be. It needs time for this relationship to flourish before we can judge Angel properly. Maybe this isn't the spin-off I need right now. I am suffering Seinfeld-withdrawal symptoms and so live in hope of a show called Kramerica, or one involving George Castanza's parents (the George and Mildred parallels, admittedly, would be uncanny). </p> <p>Instead, all I have in the dark lonely hours waiting for Paramount to schedule some Seinfeld repeats is Jerry Stiller. He's the guy who plays George's dad and in the New York-set King of Queens (Paramount) is acting substantially the same angry, angry father figure. It's a poor substitute for undiluted Seinfeld, but it'll have to do. Jerry, you know, is Ben Stiller's dad. Ben can be seen as Mr Furious (ironically enough) in Mystery Men. This sort of stuff probably doesn't mean anything to you. But it really should.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We're back in spin-off land. Will Angel (Sky 1) be to Buffy the Vampire Slayer what Rhoda was to the Mary Tyler Moore Show? Or will it be George and Mildred to Man About the House? Ah, Yootha Joyce, sad-eyed lady of the comedy lowlands, where did it all go wrong? Younger readers who have spent the last paragraph rolling their eyes skywards and wondering whether it's really true that there ain't no party like an S Club party can rejoin us now. You remember Angel. He was the one with the big black coat, a full set of strap-on wristbands, about 55 well-filled black singlets and a vast, empty canvas for a forehead. He was also a recovering vampire, seducing little Buffy with his eternal charms. Just a note about that forehead: it was created by Angel over a period of perhaps 200 years by lowering his eyebrows severely as he sank his fangs into his food. But after his blood-sucking days came to an end (a gypsy curse filled the vampire with all-too-human remorse for his nocturnal life of mass murder, as it would), his face stayed in that comely way. It made him look, like, deep. Boys, if you want to delay the ladies with your brooding, gothic charm as Angel does, practise pulling down your eyebrows in front of a mirror. That's the way - and the other eyebrow. Now you're cooking! This, of course, is something Angel can't do. Vampires, even recovering ones, I am reliably told, don't use mirrors. The premise for this spin-off was that Angel had to leave Sunnydale and lovely Buffy. But why? This, frankly, is where it gets weird. Every time Angel achieved what the script coyly referred to as \"perfect happiness\" with Buffy, he became a vampire and needed an immediate transfusion of blood from whichever human was nearest. Which can be a trial for a girl already coming to terms with post-coital tristesse. And also for a boy, I should imagine, who finds himself mutating inopportunely. In terms of the special effects, this mutation involved Angel's forehead becoming artfully filled with swollen vampire brows at what we shall laughingly call the key moment. He thereby became a dead ringer for those aliens in Deep Space Nine. You know, the chaps who throng the bridge of the new starship and look as though they have forgotten more about tele-transporting and inter-galactic engineering than Scotty ever knew. Once it was pointy ears; now the special- effects johnnies suggest alien species by appliqu\u00e9ing plastic brows to foreheads. And this, we are meant to believe, is progress in the representation of non-human life forms. I mean, really. Angel moved to LA to atone for his sins, to mourn the loss of Buffy, to forget about that California high- school schtick and become an adult. Or as adult as a dark destroyer of evil in an evil town can be. \"He's a shadow,\" some joker mentioned to set this pilot episode in its proper context, \"a faceless champion of the hapless human race.\" Well, yes, though hardly faceless. Another angel in a city of fallen... oh, you know the drill. The first hapless one was Tina, a waitress, menaced by someone called Russell. In my experience, admittedly limited, Tinas rarely get it on in untroubled fashion with Russells. And so it was in this case. \"Russell likes pain,\" said Tina, in a chilling modulation of the normal light-hearted mood. \"He really does. He talks about it like it's a friend. And you don't leave him. He leaves you when he's had enough.\" After she was killed, Angel set about getting medieval on Russell's bottom. Which was only fair. Will this spin-off work? Angel is hardly the most interesting of the Buffy ensemble. As if in recognition of this fact, the creators have brought along Cordelia, that vacuous, glamorous graduate of Sunnydale High, to be Cybill Shepherd to his Bruce Willis. Cordelia is in LA trying to make it as an actress and living in Malibu. \"A small condo on the beach,\" she told glowering Angel. \"Not a private beach, but I'm young, so I forbear.\" As in Buffy, there is fancifully eloquent writing by Joss Whedon, expanding the teenage Californian vocabulary massively and unexpectedly. Only occasionally does it collapse into solecism (\"Forbear\"? I think not). But the stage is set for an appealing series. Angel will fight evil and Cordelia will be the decorous comedy foil and rather more human than he could ever be. It needs time for this relationship to flourish before we can judge Angel properly. Maybe this isn't the spin-off I need right now. I am suffering Seinfeld-withdrawal symptoms and so live in hope of a show called Kramerica, or one involving George Castanza's parents (the George and Mildred parallels, admittedly, would be uncanny). Instead, all I have in the dark lonely hours waiting for Paramount to schedule some Seinfeld repeats is Jerry Stiller. He's the guy who plays George's dad and in the New York-set King of Queens (Paramount) is acting substantially the same angry, angry father figure. It's a poor substitute for undiluted Seinfeld, but it'll have to do. Jerry, you know, is Ben Stiller's dad. Ben can be seen as Mr Furious (ironically enough) in Mystery Men. This sort of stuff probably doesn't mean anything to you. But it really should.",

      "body": "<p>It's only a week since the millennium party, and it is already a fading memory. I imagine that if I had been one of the special guests who had to queue for three hours at Stratford Underground station before being allowed to go on to the Dome, the memory would still be quite vivid, not to say sharp. But, having witnessed the celebrations only on television, I am left with not much more than a blurred image of fireworks merging from every corner of the world. The Sydney pyrotechnics were quite memorable, as was the exploding Eiffel Tower in Paris, but otherwise the fireworks all looked much the same, wherever they were. That's the trouble with fireworks - however expensive and ingenious they are, they are never quite surprising enough. </p> <p>I had been looking forward to the River Of Fire, which had sounded genuinely exciting. It had been billed as a 200ft-high wall of flame that would race up the Thames at nearly 800 miles an hour, but, like the emperor's new clothes, nobody quite dared to admit that they couldn't see it. In his BBC television commentary, David Dimbleby expressed puzzlement that it wasn't more obvious to the naked eye, but then moved on to other matters. Most newspaper reports next day mentioned it as a feature of the celebrations, but avoided trying to describe it. </p> <p>Only on Monday did the Daily Mail reveal that the River Of Fire had been \"one of the most awe-inspiring effects seen anywhere in the world\", but only if you happened to be high up in the sky. The Mail published a photograph of several plumes of flame rising from the Thames taken from the 34th floor of the Telecom tower. From the ground, you couldn't see a thing. The organisers said that the River Of Fire had gone exactly as planned and had been \"a great success\". But can they really have planned it only to be enjoyed from the air or from the tops of tall buildings? It seems unlikely. </p> <p>At home in Hammersmith, we spent the evening and half the night in front of the television set, with only the occasional bang of a firecracker from outside reminding us that something was actually happening in the real world. We weren't feeling like going out. I had spent most of the previous fortnight in bed with pneumonia, and one of my daughters was still recovering from flu. So it was reassuring to see from the television that we weren't missing anything. And it was positively delightful to witness the misery of those invited to the Dome's grand opening when they got stuck for hours at Stratford in the cold. Thank heavens we weren't on the guest list. We might even have succumbed to temptation and gone. </p> <p>In our street in Hammersmith, the only sign of celebration was on a house opposite, which had been festooned from top to bottom with union flags. This gave the street a strangely parochial, old-fashioned look, as if we were celebrating VE Day or a royal jubilee, rather than a global event. The government, it is true, had tried to turn the millennium into a patriotic festival by spending more money on it than any other country, and at midnight the Queen was serenaded with more verses of the National Anthem than she has probably ever had to endure before. This seemed a little weird, but at the same time rather comforting after all the vapid, space-age symbolism that had preceded it. The Queen's symbolic role is at least something one can understand, which is more than can be said about the significance of two teenagers solemnly extinguishing rays of light from a giant diamond in the middle of the Dome. </p> <p> To tell the truth, I was glad to be ill in the days preceding the millennium.

      "bodyText": "It's only a week since the millennium party, and it is already a fading memory. I imagine that if I had been one of the special guests who had to queue for three hours at Stratford Underground station before being allowed to go on to the Dome, the memory would still be quite vivid, not to say sharp. But, having witnessed the celebrations only on television, I am left with not much more than a blurred image of fireworks merging from every corner of the world. The Sydney pyrotechnics were quite memorable, as was the exploding Eiffel Tower in Paris, but otherwise the fireworks all looked much the same, wherever they were. That's the trouble with fireworks - however expensive and ingenious they are, they are never quite surprising enough. I had been looking forward to the River Of Fire, which had sounded genuinely exciting. It had been billed as a 200ft-high wall of flame that would race up the Thames at nearly 800 miles an hour, but, like the emperor's new clothes, nobody quite dared to admit that they couldn't see it. In his BBC television commentary, David Dimbleby expressed puzzlement that it wasn't more obvious to the naked eye, but then moved on to other matters. Most newspaper reports next day mentioned it as a feature of the celebrations, but avoided trying to describe it. Only on Monday did the Daily Mail reveal that the River Of Fire had been \"one of the most awe-inspiring effects seen anywhere in the world\", but only if you happened to be high up in the sky. The Mail published a photograph of several plumes of flame rising from the Thames taken from the 34th floor of the Telecom tower. From the ground, you couldn't see a thing. The organisers said that the River Of Fire had gone exactly as planned and had been \"a great success\". But can they really have planned it only to be enjoyed from the air or from the tops of tall buildings? It seems unlikely. At home in Hammersmith, we spent the evening and half the night in front of the television set, with only the occasional bang of a firecracker from outside reminding us that something was actually happening in the real world. We weren't feeling like going out. I had spent most of the previous fortnight in bed with pneumonia, and one of my daughters was still recovering from flu. So it was reassuring to see from the television that we weren't missing anything. And it was positively delightful to witness the misery of those invited to the Dome's grand opening when they got stuck for hours at Stratford in the cold. Thank heavens we weren't on the guest list. We might even have succumbed to temptation and gone. In our street in Hammersmith, the only sign of celebration was on a house opposite, which had been festooned from top to bottom with union flags. This gave the street a strangely parochial, old-fashioned look, as if we were celebrating VE Day or a royal jubilee, rather than a global event. The government, it is true, had tried to turn the millennium into a patriotic festival by spending more money on it than any other country, and at midnight the Queen was serenaded with more verses of the National Anthem than she has probably ever had to endure before. This seemed a little weird, but at the same time rather comforting after all the vapid, space-age symbolism that had preceded it. The Queen's symbolic role is at least something one can understand, which is more than can be said about the significance of two teenagers solemnly extinguishing rays of light from a giant diamond in the middle of the Dome. To tell the truth, I was glad to be ill in the days preceding the millennium. My pneumonia protected me against all the hype and humbug, and ensured a quiet and untroubled transition into this new century. I felt a bit like Rip Van Winkle, awaking one day to find that, while I was sleeping, the world had moved on into a new era. Rip Van Winkle fell asleep as a subject of George III and awoke 20 years later as a citizen of a free United States. Nothing so exciting has happened to me. I am still a subject of Queen Elizabeth II and am still governed by Tony Blair, as I will doubtless continue to be for many years to come.

But the talks, predictably, have quickly run into problems. In truth, the positions adopted by both sides in Shepherdstown are weighed down by old thinking, old fears and old prejudices which could yet wreck the process. For its part, Israel has asked Washington to supply, gratis, up to $17bn worth of military assistance on top of its $2bn annual stipend. Jerusalem's wish-list includes nuclear-capable Tomahawk cruise missiles, real-time satellite intelligence and funding for its own missile defence system. It is also reportedly seeking a US-run regional weapons inspection regime and guarantees of emergency aid and oil during times of crisis. To those who may say that this a wondrous strange way to prepare for peace, Israel's reply is that such enhanced capability is essential if the prime minister, Ehud Barak, is to overcome strong domestic political opposition, assuage fears that his country's security may be compromised, and win the referendum in which Israelis will be asked to ratify any deal with Damascus. But while seeking what Mr Barak has called the \"peace of the brave\", Israel is in fact bent, as ever, on maintaining, indeed bolstering, its qualitative edge in terms of regional military power and thus its de facto political and economic Middle East dominance.</p> <p>Syria, a chronically repressed country held in thrall by its reclusive president, Hafez Assad, also has a post-Golan agenda, some of which has become apparent at Shepherdstown, and some of which is merely suspected. Its adamant insistence on a full Israeli withdrawal to the exact June 4 1967 border may or may not prove to be a show-stopper; Israel has so far firmly rejected it. But it could also presage, in the view of some Israeli commentators, destabilising Syrian attempts to revise its other international boundaries, such as that with Jordan, which it has disputed since its creation in 1923. Syria, a Cold War client of the Soviet Union and still officially deemed a sponsor of terrorism by the US is, unabashed, also looking for substantial US and international economic and security aid as the price of making peace with Israel. The confrontational behaviour at the talks of its foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, has meanwhile reminded Israelis that, in Syria's current view at least, normalised relations will not mean embassies and shopping trips in each other's capitals, let alone a sort of Damascus spring. Syria's citizens will not get the chance to vote on any agreement. While nobody can yet tell what Syria's heir apparent, Bashar Assad, may do, his father, while he remains at the helm, will have no truck with democracy or other western concepts of accountability, Golan deal or no. What is on offer from Damascus is at best a cold, barren peace; a peace rooted in the past, not the future. Like Israel, Syria seems to see Shepherdstown only as a way to advance increasingly stale, out-moded objectives based on old strategic models.

      "trailText": "Art Deco is the design movement that started originally in Paris in the 20s, characterised by bold, angular, sometimes odd shapes, geometric patterns and vivid colours. It was at first associated with high society homes between the wars, but then the same styles were adapted for more modest homes and applied to almost every household item, including chairs, electric fires, wireless sets and wall ornaments.",

It was at first associated with high society homes between the wars, but then the same styles were adapted for more modest homes and applied to almost every household item, including chairs, electric fires, wireless sets and wall ornaments.</p> <p>Demand for Art Deco remains strong, with Christie's South Kensington holding two sales in February. On the 8th is the Art Deco sale covering a range of ceramics, glass, bronzes, furniture graphics and objets of vertu. The second, on February 25, is devoted to the works of Clarice Cliff, who if not Britain's most prominent Art Deco artist was certainly its foremost ceramicist.</p> <p>The highlights of the first sale include an Argy Rousseau table lamp estimated at \u00a36,200-\u00a36,800. A poster by Willy Mucha, (no relation to the better known Alphonse) entitled Ouistreham Riva Bellu, 1934 and priced at \u00a3800-\u00a31,200, a pair of polished steel and glass gates, the glass panels designed by Rene Lalique, will be offered with an estimate at \u00a38,000 to \u00a312,000. Art Deco has gone in and out of fashion over the past 20 years, but according to Michael Jeffrey, the specialist at Christie's, demand and prices are currently strong. Prices are not out of the reach of the smaller investor, starting at around \u00a3200.</p> <p>However popular the general auction is, however, it is a safe bet that it will be surpassed by the single-owner collection of Clarice Cliff pieces. Michael Jeffrey says the Clarice Cliff sales are among the most packed of all auctions held at Christie's South Kensington.</p> <p>The industrial ceramicist from the Potteries has become a bit of a phenomenon in the collecting world with prices doubling and trebling in the past 10 years. In 1997 Christie's achieved a record for her work when an Age of Jazz Bizarre centrepiece modelled as a drummer and oboe player sold for \u00a313,800.</p> <p>Her history is well documented. She was born in Turnstall, Staffordshire in 1899 to a working class family and at 13 she joined the thousands of women working in the potteries. She achieved the rare distinction of having her name on pieces when she joined Wilkinson's factory and was taken up by its director Colley Shorter. When Shorter purchased the Newport Pottery he acquired thousands of odd shapes and Cliff suggested covering the ware in vivid geometrics. She called the results Bizarre ware. The public loved it and it was mass-produced for department stores.</p> <p>During the second world war the government stopped the production of decorated ware for domestic use. By 1952 restrictions were lifted but by then Cliff had gone out of fashion. In the 60s her pieces could be found in junk shops for a few pounds. She died in the 70s before the revival in her work truly got underway.</p> <p>The sale in February is the Barry Jones Collection. It is thought to be the largest single-owner collection ever to come to the market. The late Barry Jones began collecting in the 80s, and the sale will comprise over 400 lots and should realise between \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3250,000. The majority of the auction is dedicated to decorative plates. At one end of the sale a Beachball pattern plate and a Castellated circle plate are expected to fetch \u00a3300 to \u00a3500 each. At the other end an Applique Blue Lucerne octagonal plate, one of the highlights of the plate section, is expected to fetch \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,000.</p> <p>The collection also includes a range of rare Art Deco vases such as Cliff's Double Decker rose bowl, estimated at \u00a3800 to \u00a31,200. Age of Jazz figures are popular with collectors. A double dancing figure is estimated at \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000. Even rarer than the Age of Jazz figures is a Lady Lido ashtray estimated at \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,000. These are estimated prices. On the basis of the other recent Clarice Cliff sales these estimated prices could easily be exceeded. For further information call Christie's South Kensington, 020 7321 3120.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Art Deco is the design movement that started originally in Paris in the 20s, characterised by bold, angular, sometimes odd shapes, geometric patterns and vivid colours. It was at first associated with high society homes between the wars, but then the same styles were adapted for more modest homes and applied to almost every household item, including chairs, electric fires, wireless sets and wall ornaments. Demand for Art Deco remains strong, with Christie's South Kensington holding two sales in February. On the 8th is the Art Deco sale covering a range of ceramics, glass, bronzes, furniture graphics and objets of vertu. The second, on February 25, is devoted to the works of Clarice Cliff, who if not Britain's most prominent Art Deco artist was certainly its foremost ceramicist. The highlights of the first sale include an Argy Rousseau table lamp estimated at \u00a36,200-\u00a36,800. A poster by Willy Mucha, (no relation to the better known Alphonse) entitled Ouistreham Riva Bellu, 1934 and priced at \u00a3800-\u00a31,200, a pair of polished steel and glass gates, the glass panels designed by Rene Lalique, will be offered with an estimate at \u00a38,000 to \u00a312,000. Art Deco has gone in and out of fashion over the past 20 years, but according to Michael Jeffrey, the specialist at Christie's, demand and prices are currently strong. Prices are not out of the reach of the smaller investor, starting at around \u00a3200. However popular the general auction is, however, it is a safe bet that it will be surpassed by the single-owner collection of Clarice Cliff pieces. Michael Jeffrey says the Clarice Cliff sales are among the most packed of all auctions held at Christie's South Kensington. The industrial ceramicist from the Potteries has become a bit of a phenomenon in the collecting world with prices doubling and trebling in the past 10 years. In 1997 Christie's achieved a record for her work when an Age of Jazz Bizarre centrepiece modelled as a drummer and oboe player sold for \u00a313,800. Her history is well documented. She was born in Turnstall, Staffordshire in 1899 to a working class family and at 13 she joined the thousands of women working in the potteries. She achieved the rare distinction of having her name on pieces when she joined Wilkinson's factory and was taken up by its director Colley Shorter. When Shorter purchased the Newport Pottery he acquired thousands of odd shapes and Cliff suggested covering the ware in vivid geometrics. She called the results Bizarre ware. The public loved it and it was mass-produced for department stores. During the second world war the government stopped the production of decorated ware for domestic use. By 1952 restrictions were lifted but by then Cliff had gone out of fashion. In the 60s her pieces could be found in junk shops for a few pounds. She died in the 70s before the revival in her work truly got underway. The sale in February is the Barry Jones Collection. It is thought to be the largest single-owner collection ever to come to the market. The late Barry Jones began collecting in the 80s, and the sale will comprise over 400 lots and should realise between \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3250,000. The majority of the auction is dedicated to decorative plates. At one end of the sale a Beachball pattern plate and a Castellated circle plate are expected to fetch \u00a3300 to \u00a3500 each. At the other end an Applique Blue Lucerne octagonal plate, one of the highlights of the plate section, is expected to fetch \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,000. The collection also includes a range of rare Art Deco vases such as Cliff's Double Decker rose bowl, estimated at \u00a3800 to \u00a31,200. Age of Jazz figures are popular with collectors. A double dancing figure is estimated at \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000. Even rarer than the Age of Jazz figures is a Lady Lido ashtray estimated at \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,000. These are estimated prices. On the basis of the other recent Clarice Cliff sales these estimated prices could easily be exceeded. For further information call Christie's South Kensington, 020 7321 3120.",

This volte-face has nothing to do with bosses being overcome by new-age touchy-feeliness and everything to do with the bottom line. Finding and retaining specialist staff is increasingly difficult, employment law is a potential minefield and training and maintaining staff morale is reflected in the company's profits. In short, HR has become something of a growth industry, with top managers in great demand, and this trend will grow as the new century progresses.</p> <p>Not that you would necessarily notice the expansion from the outside. Many firms' HR departments are the same size, if not smaller, than they were in the 80s. A corporate HR department is now more often than not a channel through which others communicate rather than the originator of any action, and much of what was the core role, with the exception of employment law, is hived off to independent HR specialists. So recruitment is often delegated to agencies and consultants are brought in to assist with staff training and supervise major changes.</p> <p>There are now some 4,500 recruitment agencies in the UK, most of which are doing very nicely, thank you. The reasons are not hard to figure out. Companies simply do not have the time to wade through the stacks of CVs that arrive after jobs are advertised, nor does the HR department necessarily have the expertise to differentiate between the CVs to pick the right people.</p> <p>\"We recruit for the engineering and petro-chemical industries and our recruiters are fully qualified in these areas,\" says Jacqui Thompson, operations manager of the Human Resource Bureau. \"We have a database of personnel from all over the country, from which we put forward potential candidates that we feel meet the client's requirements. Ninety per cent of companies in our field now recruit externally. Moreover, we often find that those companies which do go it alone come to us six months later when they still haven't found the type of candidate they want.\"</p> <p>Ms Thompson's experience is borne out in other areas. \"Traditionally, companies only used headhunters for top jobs,\" says Sharon Pinner of FSS, a company which recruits for the financial and IT sectors. \"Now we are regularly asked to recruit middle-managers with starting salaries of \u00a328K. Companies are facing a shortage of good candidates for some key positions, such as accountancy and IT, and they don't have the resources to ensure they make the right choice.\"</p> <p>The willingness of companies to outsource their recruitment is not just an admission of their own failure to find employees. It is a statement of trust in the agencies. Over the past 10 years the agencies have formed an umbrella body, the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services (FRES), an industry ombudsman has been appointed and there is a rising tide of professionalism.</p> <p>\"Everyone on my team is a graduate,\" says Ms Pinner. \"Some were accountants, some teachers and some were brokers.\" This expertise does not come cheap. Salaries have been rising steadily and a top recruiter can expect to earn \u00a360K including bonus.</p> <p>Many firms are still happy to recruit junior personnel themselves but even here there has been a shift of emphasis as line managers are now encouraged to take a much more active role in the hiring and firing process, with the HR department acting as the eminence grise. But some companies cannot even be bothered with this.</p> <p>Peter Hague is the operations director for the Human Factor, an agency which places 300-400 manual-grade workers, such as refuse collectors and fork-lift truck operators per week for both private and public sector employers in the south Hampshire area. \"Our lead times are usually measured in hours if not minutes, especially when we have to find cover for absenteeism,\" he says. His responsibilities do not end there. It is his job to ensure that the minimum wage and the EU working-time directive are complied with and, come Friday, it is his company that sorts out the payroll.</p> <p>Finding the staff is only half the battle - keeping them is another. No one wants to invest a lot of time and money in training staff only to see them decamp to the opposition after a couple of years. Yet this is precisely what often takes place and the causes are usually as much personal as financial. Keeping staff happy sounds like prime HR territory and to some extent it is.</p> <p>But there has been a gradual blurring of the HR boundaries here too, as line managers have increasingly been trained to take on responsibility for some of the \"softer\" personnel issues. Conflicts and disaffections can usually be contained if dealt with by an immediate superior. If they get as far as the HR department they are almost certainly crises.</p> <p>This means that in-house HR is again one step removed from its traditional coalface and is left to co-ordinate and supervise the line managers' training so they can respond appropriately to any employee problems. Even this training function, though, is frequently outsourced to HR specialists. Ashley Callaghan, a training and development consultant, has seen his role diversify significantly in the past few years. \"There has been a huge rise in the number of companies requiring help facilitating employee issues, such as conflicts, stress, mentoring and coaching,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Many employees are now struggling to come to terms with flatter organisational structures which make any change seem like a sideways move rather than promotion. This is especially true of the new IT start-ups which typically also have only a skeleton HR function.\"</p> <p>If you're looking for the true financial worth of HR, then look no further than mergers and acquisitions. Fifty per cent are generally considered to have failed within one year, and if one assumes that the accountants had done their sums properly before the takeover then the financial unknown has to be the people. Managing the change therefore becomes of prime strategic importance and is almost always delegated to specialists.</p> <p>Michael Greenspan, a partner at Kiddy &amp; Partners, an organisational and business psychology consultancy, believes that companies have rightly identified HR as a business rather than a people issue. \"We know mergers and acquisitions are disruptive and our aim is to minimise the disruption and distraction,\" he says. \"You have to recognise that you can't make everyone happy, and try to get the staff to re-focus on the commercial issues as soon as possible.\"</p> <p>Mr Greenspan's underlying philosophy is empowerment. \"We're trying to create a culture of less dependency,\" he continues. \"We aim to help staff make their own decisions rather than doing it for them. This way we know the business will survive when we leave.\"</p> <p>This accent on personal responsibility has echoes throughout the HR sector. The people issues are no longer dumped into one office. Rather, they are spread across the entire workplace, which leaves us with a neat contradiction. There are now more opportunities and more people working in HR than ever before. The only problem is that you just might have to think a little more laterally and work a little harder to find them.</p>",

This is especially true of the new IT start-ups which typically also have only a skeleton HR function.\" If you're looking for the true financial worth of HR, then look no further than mergers and acquisitions. Fifty per cent are generally considered to have failed within one year, and if one assumes that the accountants had done their sums properly before the takeover then the financial unknown has to be the people. Managing the change therefore becomes of prime strategic importance and is almost always delegated to specialists. Michael Greenspan, a partner at Kiddy &amp; Partners, an organisational and business psychology consultancy, believes that companies have rightly identified HR as a business rather than a people issue. \"We know mergers and acquisitions are disruptive and our aim is to minimise the disruption and distraction,\" he says. \"You have to recognise that you can't make everyone happy, and try to get the staff to re-focus on the commercial issues as soon as possible.\" Mr Greenspan's underlying philosophy is empowerment. \"We're trying to create a culture of less dependency,\" he continues. \"We aim to help staff make their own decisions rather than doing it for them. This way we know the business will survive when we leave.\" This accent on personal responsibility has echoes throughout the HR sector. The people issues are no longer dumped into one office. Rather, they are spread across the entire workplace, which leaves us with a neat contradiction. There are now more opportunities and more people working in HR than ever before. The only problem is that you just might have to think a little more laterally and work a little harder to find them.",

      "body": "<p>There are several moments in David Lynch's acclaimed new film, The Straight Story, that have the audience reaching for the Kleenex. One of the most achingly beautiful comes when our hero, the 73-year-old Iowan Alvin Straight - crossing the plains of the mid-West on a humble lawnmower - is sitting by his meagre campfire, exchanging late-night philosophy with a young, scared hitch-hiker. \"When I was a kid,\" he tells her, \"my dad would tell us to pick up a stick, or a twig, and see if we could break it. And, of course, we could. Then he would tell us to tie the sticks in a bundle, and see if we could break that. And, of course, we couldn't.\" Alone, the twigs were weak. Together, they were unbreakable.</p> <p>Straight tells the story to persuade his young friend of the virtues of family, but the tale might stand for something much wider, too. In its own small, neat way, it is a parable on the limits of the individual and the strength of the collective. And right now, at the dawn of a new century, we seem ready to hear it.</p> <p>The early signs are tentative, but they are there. In almost every field of British life - from the games we play to the work we do, from the movies we watch to the products we buy - you can spot the greenshoots of a new kind of landscape, less centred on the self, more collective than before. Look around, and you can catch a glimpse of a different future. After years of fretting over Me, we might be on the brink of the decade of Us.</p> <p>It's a tall order: we're still recovering from the 80s, when the buzzwords were \"Greed is good\". Admittedly, we felt enough guilt about that to promise that the 90s would be different: caring and sharing, kinder and gentler. But the evidence was not convincing. Sure, things looked better on the outside. We created a National Lottery, raising money for good causes. We had a high street full of socially-conscious retailers, from the Body Shop to Ben &amp; Jerry. We were learning to think of someone else besides me. At least, that's how it looked.</p> <p>Underneath, though, the old, 80s self- interest still throbbed away. Powering the Lottery was not so much a new, selfless philanthropy, as the familiar 80s desire to get rich quick. The same was true of the high street. The big companies seemed softer and more caring: the corporate lettering, from Monsanto to Boots, was now written in the faux-homemade style of an innocent child. They wanted to look earthy and alternative (Boots slogan: \"Someone cares\"). But the reality did not change. Starbucks may have used a hippie-style mermaid as its logo, but it was still determined to take over the world. The Starbucks founder, Howard Schultz, admitted that the inspiration that had led him to create a chain of more than 2,500 coffee outlets across the world was not Janis Joplin but Ronald McDonald. Capitalism became cuddly in the 90s, but it was still capitalism.</p> <p>And the individualism that loomed so large in the 80s kept going strong. More people than ever before were navigating through life alone. The 90s was the decade of meals for one, of single-parent families, of Bridget Jones and her fellow singletons. Church attendances were in freefall, as the self became the new religion. Meditation, The Little Book Of Calm, feng shui: all were aimed at achieving an inner peace, inside the individual. Self-help books, from Chicken Soup For The Soul to Feel The Fear And Do It Anyway, were on the bestseller lists. Whitney Houston captured the mood when she declared in song that the Greatest Love Of All is \"learning to love yourself\".</p> <p>No, the 90s did not deliver us from the decade of Me. We may have worn looser fabrics, eaten more organic food and even done the odd bit of recycling, but that kinder, gentler era remained stubbornly out of reach. At the decade's end, a national survey found that becoming rich had become a greater personal priority than attaining either health or happiness. Janie Rogers, a sixth-former from south London, spoke for her time when she admitted her ambition was to become a newspaper reporter: \"My focus is getting good qualifications to get a good job. No one else is going to look after you. I want to earn as much as I can. Only then will it be safe to decide what I really want to do and where I want to be.\" Or, to put it another way: I, I, I; me, me, me.</p> <p>Not that Janie was charting some wholly new course for the human race. For the best part of a millennium, it's been me, me, me. Ever since Galileo and Copernicus found a way to explain the universe without God, we have placed ourselves at the centre of the cosmos. From that day on, say the historians, the self strode to the middle of the stage and refused to budge. In Shakespeare's Hamlet, Laertes asks the meaning of life and receives the answer from his father: \"To thine own self be true.\" It has been the Millennium of Me.</p> <p>Now, though, there are reasons to dare for something better. Some have been around for a while, surfacing first in the mid-90s. Why did we all get so excited in the summer of 1996? Was it really a collective passion for the European Football Championships, or was it a collective passion for collective passion? We seemed to like the camaraderie of coming together in large groups, sharing a national moment in the sun. We'd had a taste the year before, in the 50th anniversary celebrations of VE Day, and we kept coming back for more. In 1997, we had two rich doses, first with election night on May 1 and then with that still-remarkable week of mourning for Princess Diana. On each occasion, the original catalyst almost faded in importance alongside the thrill of the mass moment. In September 1999, the Sun asked readers to send in their memories not of Diana herself, but of the collective experience of the week in which we buried her. We rediscovered our appetite for belonging, and seized every chance we got to have another fix. In 1998, it was watching England play Argentina and Scotland take on Brazil in the World Cup. In 1999, the total eclipse of the sun, and millennium eve itself.</p> <p>Not that we confine our penchant for the collective to the epic event. We are finding smaller, less spectacular ways to join together. Even that most solitary of activities, reading, has become a social activity. Book clubs are spreading across the country, as friends and neighbours meet once a month to read and discuss a new (or old) story. The Book Trust, which lends supports to reading circles, says it's seen numbers double in the past year. Young couples, including those who have never joined anything before, sign up for ante-natal classes in increasing numbers: the National Childbirth Trust reports demand so great that it can barely keep up. Visit a country town or village on the weekend, and you'll soon stumble into a craft fair; organised by local people for local people. Flick through the most recent edition of the British Social Attitudes survey, and you'll see that a staggering 87% of Britons are members of something, whether of a ramblers' club or as a member of the night-staff of a rape crisis centre. Susie Orbach, the feminist writer and therapist, says that the people she sees \"want individual recognition, but they also want to be involved in mutual endeavour\".</p> <p>For some, that togetherness has come from an unexpected quarter: work. Every smart manager now seeks to turn his or her employees into a team, working as much for each other as for the company. Studies have shown that, if workers feel a sense of comradeship, they're prepared to make enormous sacrifices; sacrifices that they would never make for the boss. That's why the hottest business schools now teach team-building and communication skills; the incentive of a cash bonus may have appealed to the Me, but the real prize comes when workers bond into the Us.</p> <p>British industry is waking up to the new collectivism, too. Where once there was strife, now management and staff talk only of \"partnership\". That word is to the industrial relations of the new decade what \"strike\" was to the 70s. The employers of the CBI and the employees of the TUC talk of little else. Self-interest is seen as the way of the past; shared interest is the goal now.</p> <p>Workers are cottoning on. In the past few months, trades union membership has begun to rise for the first time since the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979. After 20 years of being ground down by the rhetoric of looking after number one, Britain's employees are realising their self-interest may lie with others. And so they are joining together.</p> <p>And the TUC has no monopoly on that sentiment. One of the country's biggest companies, Standard Life (valued at \u00a319 billion), remains a mutual society, owned by its own members. In 1998, members of the country's largest building society, Nationwide, voted to stay that way, too, resisting all moves to demutualise, even though that would have brought each of them a hefty cash windfall. The quick buck may have been tempting to the 1,130,000 Nationwiders, but they knew they'd be better off sticking together.</p> <p>Even that most self-interested and capitalistic activity, playing the stock market, has acquired an Us dimension. An unheralded phenomenon has been the recent growth of the investment club - up to 20 people, each putting up around \u00a3500, getting together to buy stocks: all amateurs, they like to spread the risk and split the profits. Five years ago, there were just 300 of these clubs; today, there are some 3,300.</p> <p>This is quite a shift in a country that once embraced Margaret Thatcher's 1987 declaration that \"there is no such thing as society\". Yet a close ear to the political ground suggests that it is real. The contempt for the public sector, and reverence for the private, that was such a feature of the Thatcher years appears to be in sharp retreat. Now it is Railtrack which is demonised in the public mind, and British Rail which is remembered fondly. Voters tell pollsters that they want private companies keeping their hands off air-traffic control and the London Underground, seeing their pursuit of profit as inherently selfish. Instead, they want people in charge who will put public safety first. They want to put their trust in people who will think about Us - not about Me.</p> <p>Indeed, attitudes that would once have been considered left wing are gaining ground among a whole range of the population. Support is rising for greater taxation, for better services, for redistribution of wealth and for regulation of industry. Voters don't want a return to old Labour methods - even if one poll found strong public backing for the renationalisation of the railways - but they do seem to hanker for those kind of public-spirited values. As if gorged on the greed-is-good fatcattery of the 80s and 90s, they now want people to think about all of us instead of just themselves.</p> <p>Still, this return to collective action and solidarity should not be misread as a wholesale lurch to the left. For the right are at it, too. The Countryside Alliance, and its campaign against foxhunting, is a textbook illustration of the noise individuals can make when they come together. Most of those at the big Alliance demos confessed that this was their debut in political activism. Until then, they had kept their heads down, preferring to look after their own. But then came what they saw as a threat to their own communities - the attempted ban on hunting with hounds - which turned this disparate group of Mes into an Us.</p> <p>Our leisure habits are beginning to tell the same story. Sport has always provided a tribal affiliation (for men, anyway), but there are signs that the coming era will take that collective impulse to a new level. The lead has been set by a town whose name hardly echoes with football history, but that might one day find itself lauded as a pioneer. AFC Bournemouth has become the first British football club to be owned by its supporters after hundreds joined together to buy their team - saving it from extinction. Now, the fans at Luton Town FC have their hearts set on a similar, shared ambition.</p> <p>When they're not cheering from terraces they may one day own, Britain's sports fans are reaching out to each other in other ways, too. Amateur participation in team sports is on the rise, with nearly one in three younger Britons of both sexes taking part. Individual activity is still the preference (with walking, weight-training and swimming the most popular), but amateur football is gaining on them, earning a place in the top five recreational sports. The loneliness of the long distance runner has given way to the gregariousness of the mass marathon. Whether at the Great North Run or the annual London Marathon, tens of thousands of Britons now jump at the chance to run in a crowd. After the race, they all say the same thing: the real kick came from being with so many like-minded people.</p> <p>Even armchair athletes are not immune to this new enthusiasm for the collective. A shift noticed by several sports commentators is the move away from the triumph of the individual to the glory of the team. We used to cheer for Connors or McEnroe, Coe or Ovett. Today, the Wimbledon of Sampras and Rusedski is widely condemned as a snoozathon, and the Olympics has been displaced as the planet's premier sporting event by the World Cup. In that shift, we have chosen the contest of teams over the ancient battle of individuals - Us over Me. In 1998, these alternatives collided, in the World Cup final. France was the team, larger than any one individual. Brazil was the assortment of stars, typified by the dazzling Ronaldo. On the day, the individual could not perform; the team won.</p> <p>Popular culture, too, seems to be bursting with, if not togetherness, then at least the yearning for it. Soap opera remains the most enduring television genre, serving up near-daily glimpses of community. The long- suffering, hard-working people of Albert Square, Coronation Street and Brookside Close live in imagined communities, directly appealing to our longing for a place where everybody knows your name. Fewer and fewer of us actually live in small, rural villages, but we enjoy picturing ourselves in Ballykissangel or Ambridge. And these are not just the yearnings of the middle-aged, hankering for a close-knit world gone by. Their children are looking for television to provide a community, too. Think of two of the most successful TV shows of our time: Friends and Neighbours. Or listen to the radio. The kids' favourites - from Steps to Boyzone, Westlife to Five, B*witched to A1 - are all groups, where the individuals are forgettable and the collective is the star. And, in case we hadn't noticed, the cinema has survived. The futurologists assumed that first the TV set and then the home video would kill off the movies: why on earth would people go out when they could stay in their living room? Answer: we like to be with other people.</p> <p>That same logic has led to one of the unlikeliest sources of the new connectedness: the computer. Once again, the doomsayers feared the worse for the electronic age. Surely we would retreat behind our terminals, shrinking into atomised, virtual people - our eyes green from the screen, our skin pale without daylight. Our best friend would be the keyboard; we would forget how to be human.</p> <p>And yet the reverse has happened. As the millionaires of the internet goldrush have discovered, the number one use of the personal computer has proved to be... communication. From workers trading gossipy, flirtatious emails to grandparents clicking on minutes-old, digital pictures of their grandchildren, the computer has become, above all, a tool of connection. The web groans with chat-rooms, on-line debates and discussion forums. Custom-built websites enable even the followers of the narrowest of specialist interests to gather with others who share the obsession. Cyber-communities are forming, and not all of them new: people have started constructing family trees on-line, in the process bumping into relatives they never knew they had.</p> <p>Sega can see where this is leading. That's why it has taken the videogame - once a byword for the loneliness of computer technology - and crossed it with the telephone modem. The result is Dreamcast, a game designed to be played with other people, all over the world. (Slogan: \"For up to Six Billion Players.\") Cyberspace is not, after all, the lonely, draughty black hole of our nightmares. Instead, it's a noisy, crowded village square - jammed with other people.</p> <p>Why is this happening? Why, after so many years of Me, is the Us beginning to break out? The first, tentative answer lies in selfishness itself. The pursuit of the self has not delivered; it has not made us happy. The most striking feature of a recent New York Times magazine special edition on the Me millennium was its consistent tone of sadness, its melancholic yearning for change. One essay, In The Age Of Radical Selfishness, culminated in a declaration that the notion of the self had done a great deal for civilisation, inspiring art, law, even morality. \"But it was never meant to save us from death, or imbue our lives with meaning and purpose,\" it said. \"The self is the root of selfishness, and selfishness is what makes us unhappy.\"</p> <p>It is as if the human race has spent two decades - and maybe much, much longer - looking after number one, and it is growing tired of the effort. Social trendspotters, such as Martin Hayward, director of consumer consultancy at the Henley Centre, say that we are now entering a \"post-materialist phase\". In the 80s, as affluence spread, we binged on wealth and on material things. But the thrill did not last. According to Hayward, \"People are sitting back and thinking, 'I've got my car, my TV, my Versace, but I'm still not happy.'\" The kick of buying has worn thin; that's why clothing retailers report flagging sales. We have the money - we just see little point in spending it. \"We've satisfied our material needs,\" says Hayward. \"Now, we want emotional satisfaction.\" And that takes other people.</p> <p>Susie Orbach has noticed something similar from her perch next to the couch. Her clients come to realise that they cannot focus solely on themselves; the self alone cannot take the weight. After all, she says, \"the self is constructed only in connection with others\". It is a straight, simple truth: if we cannot make a connection, we cease to be human.</p> <p>The modern focus on Me is triggering a growth in Us in less abstract ways, too. The fastest-growing social category is singles:there will be 55% more of them in 2011 than there were in 1991. One might imagine this new army of singletons to be the crack troops of the age of the self: with no long-term partner and no dependents, they have no one to think of but themselves, right? Wrong. It turns out that single people are the avant garde of the Us decade. They may have pursued personal autonomy by getting divorced, or escaped oppressive families by raising children alone, but that does not mean they are in the business of serving Me alone. On the contrary, they are seeking connections - looser than the nuclear families of old perhaps - but connections all the same. While marrieds have an automatic community to come home to, in the form of their family, singles have to form ties elsewhere. And they are, whether by polishing up their tembleque at the neighbourhood salsa class or by planting bulbs in the communal garden. They may look like the Me generation, but the growing ranks of the unattached are actually laying the foundations of the new Us.</p> <p>A second factor is power. A shift has hap-pened in these past few years, a move of authority away from Them and toward Us. Perhaps the first to be hit by the change was big business. The major firms used to be in charge, enjoying the polite respect of their customers: just look at the meekness of a 50s letter of complaint. Now, it's the other way around, with the consumer in control. If they don't like a product, they say so in a brash, terse message usually sent by email.</p> <p>Sometimes, it's organised, such as the worldwide movement against Monsanto, a campaign whose impact has been so great that some believe it may eventually bring down the company. The balance of power is shifting. Just as individual workers clubbed together to form unions in the 19th century, so today's consumers are uniting, demanding a new kind of collective bargaining: for lower prices and, increasingly, for good corporate behaviour. Where once workers threatened a strike, today's mass consumers threaten an internet-organised, global boycott. They are realising that even in that most stereotypically selfish of activities - shopping - there is a fearsome power to Us.</p> <p>An equivalent shift is happening outside the mall, in the other arenas of public life. Philip Dodd, director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts, reckons that on December 31 we buried \"the century not of the common man, but of the expert\". In the past, we relied on elites - Them - to make our big decisions for us, whether that was doctors determining our health or the Arts Council and the BBC deciding our culture. Professionals mediated, sifted and graded it all for us. Now, thanks to new technology, we can do all that for ourselves. We can read a full speech by Tony Blair on the web; we don't need a newspaper to tell us what he said. \"We live in a karaoke culture,\" says Dodd. We have no need for an authority figure: we can sing the song ourselves.</p> <p>The result is a greater emphasis on the Us - not as a reaction to Me, but as an alternative to Them. If power is no longer with the men at the top, then the burden shifts to us. To carry it, we have to join together. Hence the new breed of \"social entrepreneurs\", such as the patients who own their own health centre in Bromley-by-Bow, east London, or the citizens of Balsall Heath, Birmingham, who set up their own self-policing scheme. These groups have realised that if there is no Them to look to, it will have to be Us instead.</p> <p>Let's say that the optimists are right. What might this new Us look like? Most stargazers agree that the communities of the future will have little in common with the ones of the past. For a start, they will be groups that we choose to belong to. For most of the past millennium, people did not opt in; they were born in. If a boy was raised in a mining village, that meant he would become a miner and know miners and miners' wives until the day he died. Now, it is rare to live and work in the same place. That leaves no guarantee that we will, no reason why we should, know our next-door neighbours.</p> <p>Instead, we select our communities. Thanks to the internet, we can be part of a global network of green activists or Star Trek obsessives - and live nowhere near any of them. The \"members\" may never meet, and nobody will have forced them to join. It is what Martin Hayward calls \"elective collectivism\" and it is wholly new. To take one example: in the communities of the past, membership of one group automatically excluded membership of another. It was hard to live in a small, Catholic village, say, and be a homosexual. Today, you can live in Brighton's gayest district and read the Catholic Herald online; you can choose to be part of two or more groups at once. People do not have an identity; they have multiple identities.</p> <p>So, the new communities will be very different from the old, only rarely tied to geography. They will probably be looser, more self-selecting. So, when we speak about the Jewish community of the future, we will talk less about a cluster of people living together in London's Golders Green or Stamford Hill and more about two Jews - one in Chicago, the other in Wrexham - emailing each other about the story of Chanukah. Tomorrow's communities are likely to be more provisional, more fleeting, too - such as the protesters against the World Trade Organisation, who took over Seattle last month. Briefly united in a cause, coralled by the rallying cry of the internet, they broke away as quickly as they came together.</p> <p>We will find it hard to make this transition, for it is a journey into uncharted territory. Our pop culture is not much of a guide. It wants to depict community the way it used to be: the pub in EastEnders, the garden f te at Ambridge. \"We should see these as works of elegy,\" says Dodd, as farewells to \"a whole lot of Us's that we've lost\". The mining village of Brassed Off, the yeoman England of Bobby Moore's 1966 team: we yearn for them, but only because we know they're gone. The communities of the future will be different. This, says Dodd, should be our millennial resolution: to accept that old models of belonging have gone, and to start dreaming of new ones.</p> <p>The American writer Thomas Friedman says that the old, cold-war world was defined by division and was symbolised by the Berlin Wall. Today's globalised world, meanwhile, is defined by integration and is symbolised by the web. It is a hopeful symbol: a collection of loose, frail threads tying one individual to another. Will it work? Will the new century be different from the last? There can be only one answer: it's up to us.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are several moments in David Lynch's acclaimed new film, The Straight Story, that have the audience reaching for the Kleenex. One of the most achingly beautiful comes when our hero, the 73-year-old Iowan Alvin Straight - crossing the plains of the mid-West on a humble lawnmower - is sitting by his meagre campfire, exchanging late-night philosophy with a young, scared hitch-hiker. \"When I was a kid,\" he tells her, \"my dad would tell us to pick up a stick, or a twig, and see if we could break it. And, of course, we could. Then he would tell us to tie the sticks in a bundle, and see if we could break that. And, of course, we couldn't.\" Alone, the twigs were weak. Together, they were unbreakable. Straight tells the story to persuade his young friend of the virtues of family, but the tale might stand for something much wider, too. In its own small, neat way, it is a parable on the limits of the individual and the strength of the collective. And right now, at the dawn of a new century, we seem ready to hear it. The early signs are tentative, but they are there. In almost every field of British life - from the games we play to the work we do, from the movies we watch to the products we buy - you can spot the greenshoots of a new kind of landscape, less centred on the self, more collective than before. Look around, and you can catch a glimpse of a different future. After years of fretting over Me, we might be on the brink of the decade of Us. It's a tall order: we're still recovering from the 80s, when the buzzwords were \"Greed is good\". Admittedly, we felt enough guilt about that to promise that the 90s would be different: caring and sharing, kinder and gentler. But the evidence was not convincing. Sure, things looked better on the outside. We created a National Lottery, raising money for good causes. We had a high street full of socially-conscious retailers, from the Body Shop to Ben &amp; Jerry. We were learning to think of someone else besides me. At least, that's how it looked. Underneath, though, the old, 80s self- interest still throbbed away. Powering the Lottery was not so much a new, selfless philanthropy, as the familiar 80s desire to get rich quick. The same was true of the high street. The big companies seemed softer and more caring: the corporate lettering, from Monsanto to Boots, was now written in the faux-homemade style of an innocent child. They wanted to look earthy and alternative (Boots slogan: \"Someone cares\"). But the reality did not change. Starbucks may have used a hippie-style mermaid as its logo, but it was still determined to take over the world. The Starbucks founder, Howard Schultz, admitted that the inspiration that had led him to create a chain of more than 2,500 coffee outlets across the world was not Janis Joplin but Ronald McDonald. Capitalism became cuddly in the 90s, but it was still capitalism. And the individualism that loomed so large in the 80s kept going strong. More people than ever before were navigating through life alone. The 90s was the decade of meals for one, of single-parent families, of Bridget Jones and her fellow singletons. Church attendances were in freefall, as the self became the new religion. Meditation, The Little Book Of Calm, feng shui: all were aimed at achieving an inner peace, inside the individual. Self-help books, from Chicken Soup For The Soul to Feel The Fear And Do It Anyway, were on the bestseller lists. Whitney Houston captured the mood when she declared in song that the Greatest Love Of All is \"learning to love yourself\". No, the 90s did not deliver us from the decade of Me. We may have worn looser fabrics, eaten more organic food and even done the odd bit of recycling, but that kinder, gentler era remained stubbornly out of reach. At the decade's end, a national survey found that becoming rich had become a greater personal priority than attaining either health or happiness. Janie Rogers, a sixth-former from south London, spoke for her time when she admitted her ambition was to become a newspaper reporter: \"My focus is getting good qualifications to get a good job. No one else is going to look after you. I want to earn as much as I can. Only then will it be safe to decide what I really want to do and where I want to be.\" Or, to put it another way: I, I, I; me, me, me. Not that Janie was charting some wholly new course for the human race. For the best part of a millennium, it's been me, me, me. Ever since Galileo and Copernicus found a way to explain the universe without God, we have placed ourselves at the centre of the cosmos. From that day on, say the historians, the self strode to the middle of the stage and refused to budge. In Shakespeare's Hamlet, Laertes asks the meaning of life and receives the answer from his father: \"To thine own self be true.\" It has been the Millennium of Me. Now, though, there are reasons to dare for something better. Some have been around for a while, surfacing first in the mid-90s. Why did we all get so excited in the summer of 1996? Was it really a collective passion for the European Football Championships, or was it a collective passion for collective passion? We seemed to like the camaraderie of coming together in large groups, sharing a national moment in the sun. We'd had a taste the year before, in the 50th anniversary celebrations of VE Day, and we kept coming back for more. In 1997, we had two rich doses, first with election night on May 1 and then with that still-remarkable week of mourning for Princess Diana. On each occasion, the original catalyst almost faded in importance alongside the thrill of the mass moment. In September 1999, the Sun asked readers to send in their memories not of Diana herself, but of the collective experience of the week in which we buried her. We rediscovered our appetite for belonging, and seized every chance we got to have another fix. In 1998, it was watching England play Argentina and Scotland take on Brazil in the World Cup. In 1999, the total eclipse of the sun, and millennium eve itself. Not that we confine our penchant for the collective to the epic event. We are finding smaller, less spectacular ways to join together. Even that most solitary of activities, reading, has become a social activity. Book clubs are spreading across the country, as friends and neighbours meet once a month to read and discuss a new (or old) story. The Book Trust, which lends supports to reading circles, says it's seen numbers double in the past year. Young couples, including those who have never joined anything before, sign up for ante-natal classes in increasing numbers: the National Childbirth Trust reports demand so great that it can barely keep up. Visit a country town or village on the weekend, and you'll soon stumble into a craft fair; organised by local people for local people. Flick through the most recent edition of the British Social Attitudes survey, and you'll see that a staggering 87% of Britons are members of something, whether of a ramblers' club or as a member of the night-staff of a rape crisis centre. Susie Orbach, the feminist writer and therapist, says that the people she sees \"want individual recognition, but they also want to be involved in mutual endeavour\". For some, that togetherness has come from an unexpected quarter: work. Every smart manager now seeks to turn his or her employees into a team, working as much for each other as for the company. Studies have shown that, if workers feel a sense of comradeship, they're prepared to make enormous sacrifices; sacrifices that they would never make for the boss. That's why the hottest business schools now teach team-building and communication skills; the incentive of a cash bonus may have appealed to the Me, but the real prize comes when workers bond into the Us. British industry is waking up to the new collectivism, too. Where once there was strife, now management and staff talk only of \"partnership\". That word is to the industrial relations of the new decade what \"strike\" was to the 70s. The employers of the CBI and the employees of the TUC talk of little else. Self-interest is seen as the way of the past; shared interest is the goal now. Workers are cottoning on. In the past few months, trades union membership has begun to rise for the first time since the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979. After 20 years of being ground down by the rhetoric of looking after number one, Britain's employees are realising their self-interest may lie with others. And so they are joining together. And the TUC has no monopoly on that sentiment. One of the country's biggest companies, Standard Life (valued at \u00a319 billion), remains a mutual society, owned by its own members. In 1998, members of the country's largest building society, Nationwide, voted to stay that way, too, resisting all moves to demutualise, even though that would have brought each of them a hefty cash windfall. The quick buck may have been tempting to the 1,130,000 Nationwiders, but they knew they'd be better off sticking together. Even that most self-interested and capitalistic activity, playing the stock market, has acquired an Us dimension. An unheralded phenomenon has been the recent growth of the investment club - up to 20 people, each putting up around \u00a3500, getting together to buy stocks: all amateurs, they like to spread the risk and split the profits. Five years ago, there were just 300 of these clubs; today, there are some 3,300. This is quite a shift in a country that once embraced Margaret Thatcher's 1987 declaration that \"there is no such thing as society\". Yet a close ear to the political ground suggests that it is real. The contempt for the public sector, and reverence for the private, that was such a feature of the Thatcher years appears to be in sharp retreat. Now it is Railtrack which is demonised in the public mind, and British Rail which is remembered fondly. Voters tell pollsters that they want private companies keeping their hands off air-traffic control and the London Underground, seeing their pursuit of profit as inherently selfish. Instead, they want people in charge who will put public safety first. They want to put their trust in people who will think about Us - not about Me. Indeed, attitudes that would once have been considered left wing are gaining ground among a whole range of the population. Support is rising for greater taxation, for better services, for redistribution of wealth and for regulation of industry. Voters don't want a return to old Labour methods - even if one poll found strong public backing for the renationalisation of the railways - but they do seem to hanker for those kind of public-spirited values. As if gorged on the greed-is-good fatcattery of the 80s and 90s, they now want people to think about all of us instead of just themselves. Still, this return to collective action and solidarity should not be misread as a wholesale lurch to the left. For the right are at it, too. The Countryside Alliance, and its campaign against foxhunting, is a textbook illustration of the noise individuals can make when they come together. Most of those at the big Alliance demos confessed that this was their debut in political activism. Until then, they had kept their heads down, preferring to look after their own. But then came what they saw as a threat to their own communities - the attempted ban on hunting with hounds - which turned this disparate group of Mes into an Us. Our leisure habits are beginning to tell the same story. Sport has always provided a tribal affiliation (for men, anyway), but there are signs that the coming era will take that collective impulse to a new level. The lead has been set by a town whose name hardly echoes with football history, but that might one day find itself lauded as a pioneer. AFC Bournemouth has become the first British football club to be owned by its supporters after hundreds joined together to buy their team - saving it from extinction. Now, the fans at Luton Town FC have their hearts set on a similar, shared ambition. When they're not cheering from terraces they may one day own, Britain's sports fans are reaching out to each other in other ways, too. Amateur participation in team sports is on the rise, with nearly one in three younger Britons of both sexes taking part. Individual activity is still the preference (with walking, weight-training and swimming the most popular), but amateur football is gaining on them, earning a place in the top five recreational sports. The loneliness of the long distance runner has given way to the gregariousness of the mass marathon. Whether at the Great North Run or the annual London Marathon, tens of thousands of Britons now jump at the chance to run in a crowd. After the race, they all say the same thing: the real kick came from being with so many like-minded people. Even armchair athletes are not immune to this new enthusiasm for the collective. A shift noticed by several sports commentators is the move away from the triumph of the individual to the glory of the team. We used to cheer for Connors or McEnroe, Coe or Ovett. Today, the Wimbledon of Sampras and Rusedski is widely condemned as a snoozathon, and the Olympics has been displaced as the planet's premier sporting event by the World Cup. In that shift, we have chosen the contest of teams over the ancient battle of individuals - Us over Me. In 1998, these alternatives collided, in the World Cup final. France was the team, larger than any one individual. Brazil was the assortment of stars, typified by the dazzling Ronaldo. On the day, the individual could not perform; the team won. Popular culture, too, seems to be bursting with, if not togetherness, then at least the yearning for it. Soap opera remains the most enduring television genre, serving up near-daily glimpses of community. The long- suffering, hard-working people of Albert Square, Coronation Street and Brookside Close live in imagined communities, directly appealing to our longing for a place where everybody knows your name. Fewer and fewer of us actually live in small, rural villages, but we enjoy picturing ourselves in Ballykissangel or Ambridge. And these are not just the yearnings of the middle-aged, hankering for a close-knit world gone by. Their children are looking for television to provide a community, too. Think of two of the most successful TV shows of our time: Friends and Neighbours. Or listen to the radio. The kids' favourites - from Steps to Boyzone, Westlife to Five, B*witched to A1 - are all groups, where the individuals are forgettable and the collective is the star. And, in case we hadn't noticed, the cinema has survived. The futurologists assumed that first the TV set and then the home video would kill off the movies: why on earth would people go out when they could stay in their living room? Answer: we like to be with other people. That same logic has led to one of the unlikeliest sources of the new connectedness: the computer. Once again, the doomsayers feared the worse for the electronic age. Surely we would retreat behind our terminals, shrinking into atomised, virtual people - our eyes green from the screen, our skin pale without daylight. Our best friend would be the keyboard; we would forget how to be human. And yet the reverse has happened. As the millionaires of the internet goldrush have discovered, the number one use of the personal computer has proved to be... communication. From workers trading gossipy, flirtatious emails to grandparents clicking on minutes-old, digital pictures of their grandchildren, the computer has become, above all, a tool of connection. The web groans with chat-rooms, on-line debates and discussion forums. Custom-built websites enable even the followers of the narrowest of specialist interests to gather with others who share the obsession. Cyber-communities are forming, and not all of them new: people have started constructing family trees on-line, in the process bumping into relatives they never knew they had. Sega can see where this is leading. That's why it has taken the videogame - once a byword for the loneliness of computer technology - and crossed it with the telephone modem. The result is Dreamcast, a game designed to be played with other people, all over the world. (Slogan: \"For up to Six Billion Players.\") Cyberspace is not, after all, the lonely, draughty black hole of our nightmares. Instead, it's a noisy, crowded village square - jammed with other people. Why is this happening? Why, after so many years of Me, is the Us beginning to break out? The first, tentative answer lies in selfishness itself. The pursuit of the self has not delivered; it has not made us happy. The most striking feature of a recent New York Times magazine special edition on the Me millennium was its consistent tone of sadness, its melancholic yearning for change. One essay, In The Age Of Radical Selfishness, culminated in a declaration that the notion of the self had done a great deal for civilisation, inspiring art, law, even morality. \"But it was never meant to save us from death, or imbue our lives with meaning and purpose,\" it said. \"The self is the root of selfishness, and selfishness is what makes us unhappy.\" It is as if the human race has spent two decades - and maybe much, much longer - looking after number one, and it is growing tired of the effort.

We have the money - we just see little point in spending it. \"We've satisfied our material needs,\" says Hayward. \"Now, we want emotional satisfaction.\" And that takes other people. Susie Orbach has noticed something similar from her perch next to the couch. Her clients come to realise that they cannot focus solely on themselves; the self alone cannot take the weight. After all, she says, \"the self is constructed only in connection with others\". It is a straight, simple truth: if we cannot make a connection, we cease to be human. The modern focus on Me is triggering a growth in Us in less abstract ways, too. The fastest-growing social category is singles:there will be 55% more of them in 2011 than there were in 1991.

And they are, whether by polishing up their tembleque at the neighbourhood salsa class or by planting bulbs in the communal garden. They may look like the Me generation, but the growing ranks of the unattached are actually laying the foundations of the new Us. A second factor is power. A shift has hap-pened in these past few years, a move of authority away from Them and toward Us. Perhaps the first to be hit by the change was big business. The major firms used to be in charge, enjoying the polite respect of their customers: just look at the meekness of a 50s letter of complaint.

Today's globalised world, meanwhile, is defined by integration and is symbolised by the web. It is a hopeful symbol: a collection of loose, frail threads tying one individual to another. Will it work? Will the new century be different from the last? There can be only one answer: it's up to us.",

      "body": "<p>Shoreditch, in the London Borough of Hackney, has had its fair share of media hype. Billed as the latest place for the young and successful to live, work and play, its gentrification has masked some of the more gritty aspects of inner urban reality - such as the area's high rates of crime and deprivation.</p> <p>But where Neighbourhood Watch schemes lack any real clout, a collection of like-minded individuals has quietly ignored the problems and unwittingly developed a model for harmonious urban living. Five years ago, an old factory tucked behind the Hackney Council offices and that had been empty, bar the occasional Friday-night rave, for a decade had its leasehold bought by developer. Over the next year, the site was transformed, among the changes being the creation of a three-storey block with three differently-shaped live/work units on each of its floors. The result was nine seductively spacious, oak-floored flats averaging 1,000ft square. All were snapped up within days of their white-painted walls going dry.</p> <p>Website designer Paul Crowley, 30, is the block's latest recruit, and has lived with his girlfriend Louise Ventris, another web designer, on the ground floor for a year. He claims, like the others in the building, simply to \"have been in the right place at the right time\", although his decision to move in was clinched by the letting agents' patter: \"Your neighbours are all young, do similar things and have lots of parties.\"</p> <p>\"I'm always amazed by the friendliness here,\" says Crowley. \"Within three weeks of moving in, I was asked to a party upstairs. I'm having a party soon, and I've just invited a bloke I've never met before who lives on the other side of the street.\"</p> <p>The generous dimensions, copious light and quiet location offered by each unit has, perhaps unsurprisingly, pulled together similar minds. Nearly every creative art is represented over the three floors, including photographers, an interior architect, a jewellery designer and an art director. One second-floor flat was, until recently, the home of a Turner Prize nominee. The only exception in the building is a lawyer.</p> <p>Art director Paul Griggs, like many of his neighbours, works inches from his bed. His top-floor flat, which he shares with pop promo director Dominic Leung, gives him the benefits of the long hours of afternoon light. \"Being of like minds here means we can always lend and borrow things,\" he says. \"I needed an extension lead this morning and after five knocks I had one.\"</p> <p>Being from similar professions also means that everyone respects the long hours that their fellow residents often do. Ed Reeve, 27, who took the photographs for this article, lives on the second floor and often works late into the night. \"I don't have the time or energy to go out far,\" he says. \"It is so easy to nip upstairs to chill or grab someone to go to the nearest bar.\"</p> <p>Adam Bryant, 33, is a freelance hairdresser who lives with his partner, Ellis MacDonald, 32, a cook, next door to Griggs. \"We both work very long days,\" he says, \"and I appreciate my privacy at the end of them. But I like the fact that I know everyone in the building and that we are all looking out for each other. For example, I never have to worry about my cat when I go away. I have never had that before with other places I've lived in in London.\"</p> <p>Some very strong professional and social bonds have been forged beyond the background harmony. Reeve lives on the second floor with Teak Tse, 26, but works (and plays) closely with Griggs. \"When we moved in three-and-a-half years ago,\" he says, \"it was like moving into a halls of residence. Paul and I moved the same weekend, excitedly lugging our boxes up the stairs. We look after each other. Paul has a set of keys to my flat, so he can use my email whenever he wants. My flat and his generally take it in turns to cook for each other. It's usually a case of whoever has the food.\"</p> <p>Reeve has also worked with Charlotte Dinesen, an interior designer who lives next door, and also seeks the advice of Neil Wilder upstairs, who is the only photographer Reeve knows socially. In turn, Wilder has become close to Dinesen as a result of being the equivalent of her IT help desk. \"I used to pop down and fix her computer,\" he says, \"but we have now become great friends. The two of us are always up and down between our flats. I turned 40 last October and muttered something about having a party. Within days, Charlotte had organised everything: invites, the music, food and drink. Now, going to the flower market together on a Sunday has become a bit of an institution.\"</p> <p>Sometimes, four-year-old Olga joins them. She lives next door to Wilder with her parents, Camilla and Steen Rosenfalch, and siblings Hector, two, and Hannibal, six months. The children happily play at home, of course, but the magical, uncluttered space of Wilder's floor is a toddlers' delight - \"Until they go near the rice lamps and Neil gets that look in his eye,\" says Dinesen.</p> <p>Having a friendly network around a young family has proved useful at other crucial times, too. When Camilla's contractions began in the early hours for each of her boys, Dinesen held the fort while Steen was at the hospital. \"In the last flat we lived in in London, we didn't know anyone around us,\" says Camilla. \"The day we tested out our new stereo, our neighbour threw a complete fit and showed us which notch we could turn the volume to. Here, it's give and take. Everyone makes noise or throws a party once in a while.\"</p> <p>So, when Wilder celebrated his birthday, rather than complain about Hannibal's sleep being disturbed, the family loaned their flat as storage for his furniture and took themselves away for the weekend. Unsurprisingly, Wilder, who moved to the capital two years ago, says that \"living here has definitely helped me to love London\".</p> <p>Dinesen, the \"house mummy\", meanwhile, is reluctantly thinking of moving permanently, for work reasons. \"But I can't let go of this place completely,\" she says. \"I hope to be able to afford a unit for office space. I'm now terrified of grumpy neighbours and grumpy landlords. We have just a very casual but comfortable way of getting on with it here.\"</p> <p>Camilla agrees: \"It's just nice to know that if you are happy or sad, there's always someone to talk to.\"</p>",

I'm having a party soon, and I've just invited a bloke I've never met before who lives on the other side of the street.\" The generous dimensions, copious light and quiet location offered by each unit has, perhaps unsurprisingly, pulled together similar minds. Nearly every creative art is represented over the three floors, including photographers, an interior architect, a jewellery designer and an art director. One second-floor flat was, until recently, the home of a Turner Prize nominee. The only exception in the building is a lawyer. Art director Paul Griggs, like many of his neighbours, works inches from his bed. His top-floor flat, which he shares with pop promo director Dominic Leung, gives him the benefits of the long hours of afternoon light. \"Being of like minds here means we can always lend and borrow things,\" he says. \"I needed an extension lead this morning and after five knocks I had one.\" Being from similar professions also means that everyone respects the long hours that their fellow residents often do. Ed Reeve, 27, who took the photographs for this article, lives on the second floor and often works late into the night. \"I don't have the time or energy to go out far,\" he says. \"It is so easy to nip upstairs to chill or grab someone to go to the nearest bar.\" Adam Bryant, 33, is a freelance hairdresser who lives with his partner, Ellis MacDonald, 32, a cook, next door to Griggs. \"We both work very long days,\" he says, \"and I appreciate my privacy at the end of them. But I like the fact that I know everyone in the building and that we are all looking out for each other. For example, I never have to worry about my cat when I go away. I have never had that before with other places I've lived in in London.\" Some very strong professional and social bonds have been forged beyond the background harmony. Reeve lives on the second floor with Teak Tse, 26, but works (and plays) closely with Griggs. \"When we moved in three-and-a-half years ago,\" he says, \"it was like moving into a halls of residence. Paul and I moved the same weekend, excitedly lugging our boxes up the stairs. We look after each other. Paul has a set of keys to my flat, so he can use my email whenever he wants. My flat and his generally take it in turns to cook for each other. It's usually a case of whoever has the food.\" Reeve has also worked with Charlotte Dinesen, an interior designer who lives next door, and also seeks the advice of Neil Wilder upstairs, who is the only photographer Reeve knows socially. In turn, Wilder has become close to Dinesen as a result of being the equivalent of her IT help desk. \"I used to pop down and fix her computer,\" he says, \"but we have now become great friends. The two of us are always up and down between our flats. I turned 40 last October and muttered something about having a party. Within days, Charlotte had organised everything: invites, the music, food and drink. Now, going to the flower market together on a Sunday has become a bit of an institution.\" Sometimes, four-year-old Olga joins them. She lives next door to Wilder with her parents, Camilla and Steen Rosenfalch, and siblings Hector, two, and Hannibal, six months. The children happily play at home, of course, but the magical, uncluttered space of Wilder's floor is a toddlers' delight - \"Until they go near the rice lamps and Neil gets that look in his eye,\" says Dinesen. Having a friendly network around a young family has proved useful at other crucial times, too. When Camilla's contractions began in the early hours for each of her boys, Dinesen held the fort while Steen was at the hospital. \"In the last flat we lived in in London, we didn't know anyone around us,\" says Camilla. \"The day we tested out our new stereo, our neighbour threw a complete fit and showed us which notch we could turn the volume to. Here, it's give and take. Everyone makes noise or throws a party once in a while.\" So, when Wilder celebrated his birthday, rather than complain about Hannibal's sleep being disturbed, the family loaned their flat as storage for his furniture and took themselves away for the weekend. Unsurprisingly, Wilder, who moved to the capital two years ago, says that \"living here has definitely helped me to love London\". Dinesen, the \"house mummy\", meanwhile, is reluctantly thinking of moving permanently, for work reasons. \"But I can't let go of this place completely,\" she says. \"I hope to be able to afford a unit for office space. I'm now terrified of grumpy neighbours and grumpy landlords. We have just a very casual but comfortable way of getting on with it here.\" Camilla agrees: \"It's just nice to know that if you are happy or sad, there's always someone to talk to.\"",

Clinging to a rock face and a massive Victorian railway retaining wall, the graceful steel structure in New Mills, Derbyshire, completes the final, missing section of the 220-mile Midshires long distance trail. The \u00a3525,000 steel path snakes along the side of the Torrs gorge in New Mills, where the river Goyt tumbles down from the High Peak towards Cheshire. Superficially a typical small northern industrial town built of dark millstone grit, New Mills's huddle of buildings suddenly gives way to one of the most striking landscapes in urban Britain. \"It's more like something out of the Himalayas,\" said Chris Hartley of Derbyshire county council, which has financed the walkway along with New Mills and High Peak councils and \u00a3215,000 from the millennium commission. \"Up to now, you could only get through the gorge by rock climbing and abseiling - you trekked all the way up the Midshires trail from Buckinghamshire and then found this 175-yard stretch which was impassable to walkers.\" New Mills is a shrine to walkers as the base of the Kinder trespass of the 1930s, which launched the struggle to open up miles of moorland to public access. Ramblers were held in the town's police station after clashes with police and gamekeepers on the nearby grouse-shooting heights of Kinder Scout fell.

She kept on dancing.</p> <p>\"It's amazing what adrenaline will do. I managed to fake it by putting all weight on left foot and inventing steps to get me where I needed to be.\" When she came offstage at the end of the scene, she insisted on returning for a few minutes in the next scene. She felt she had to.</p> <p>\"It was Natalia Makarova's second performance in Giselle and she wasn't yet completely familiar with the production. I was doing the Queen of the Willies. I said, 'I have to get her on stage'. I did so, but when I had finished I had a football on my foot: I ended up in full makeup in casualty in Charing Cross hospital.\"</p> <p>She was 30 then, and it was her first bad injury. \"I wasn't really dancing fully for a year, but I learnt an awful lot in that year.\"</p> <p>Now she is 58, and teaching: she is second in command at the Royal Ballet. Brilliance you might expect at the Royal Opera House; competence as well is rather shocking. Next Wednesday they perform three Kenneth MacMillan ballets under her supervision. She takes rehearsals, mothers, the younger dancers, and above all, I think, teaches the things that cannot be written down, but which constitute the life and experience of the ballet company.</p> <p>She has been there almost all her life: \"I joined the company at 16 and have been here 42 years. It sounds a very long time. It doesn't feel like a very long time.\" As a child in South Africa she did not even know that such a life was possible. Though she started dancing at four, she did not realise she wanted to be a professional dancer until she was 10 and saw Oklahoma and Annie Get Your Gun.</p> <p>She did not realise it was possible until she was 12, and the Sadler's Wells Ballet came to Johannesburg on tour. \"Then I realised what all the hard work had been in aid of.\" At 16, her newly widowed mother returned to England and she enrolled in the Royal Ballet School. At 20, Kenneth MacMillan made Rite of Spring for her.</p> <p>\"My younger sister did dance, and was I think talented, but she was a regular young person, involved with clothes and makeup and boys. I was already working and all of that went on hold a bit. I didn't have time to be a teenager.</p> <p>\"I think that I was a very natural dancer. Movement and performance came naturally to me. I wasn't a particularly good classical dancer, but I know that in my generation I made a contribution to this company and that I was a very useful and felt a very valued member.</p> <p>\"One of my teachers, Miss Edwards said to me, 'If I can compare the company to an orchestra, you're not in among the violins, but you're more like a cello or a bass. Wherever you play you'll always be heard'.</p> <p>\"The drug for us actually is the use of your body to express something. It is a very physical art form, and you are always attempting to get two arms, two legs and a body to serve your purposes. That's an extraordinary feeling: being exhausted, being out of breath and being hot and sweaty is all part of it.\"</p> <p>It is terribly important, she says, that the Royal Ballet has kept its orchestra and does not dance to tapes, which are the same every night, as most other companies now must. Though they spend hours every day drilling the dancers, the point of it all is a sort of spontaneity.</p> <p>She has a strong, lean, sympathetic face, as if it had been out in a desert wind for a long time, but as she talks, I realise this is wrong: it's not that she has been weathered but that she's actually a phoenix, passing on the flame.</p>",

She felt she had to. \"It was Natalia Makarova's second performance in Giselle and she wasn't yet completely familiar with the production. I was doing the Queen of the Willies. I said, 'I have to get her on stage'. I did so, but when I had finished I had a football on my foot: I ended up in full makeup in casualty in Charing Cross hospital.\" She was 30 then, and it was her first bad injury. \"I wasn't really dancing fully for a year, but I learnt an awful lot in that year.\" Now she is 58, and teaching: she is second in command at the Royal Ballet. Brilliance you might expect at the Royal Opera House; competence as well is rather shocking. Next Wednesday they perform three Kenneth MacMillan ballets under her supervision. She takes rehearsals, mothers, the younger dancers, and above all, I think, teaches the things that cannot be written down, but which constitute the life and experience of the ballet company. She has been there almost all her life: \"I joined the company at 16 and have been here 42 years. It sounds a very long time. It doesn't feel like a very long time.\" As a child in South Africa she did not even know that such a life was possible. Though she started dancing at four, she did not realise she wanted to be a professional dancer until she was 10 and saw Oklahoma and Annie Get Your Gun. She did not realise it was possible until she was 12, and the Sadler's Wells Ballet came to Johannesburg on tour. \"Then I realised what all the hard work had been in aid of.\" At 16, her newly widowed mother returned to England and she enrolled in the Royal Ballet School. At 20, Kenneth MacMillan made Rite of Spring for her. \"My younger sister did dance, and was I think talented, but she was a regular young person, involved with clothes and makeup and boys. I was already working and all of that went on hold a bit. I didn't have time to be a teenager. \"I think that I was a very natural dancer. Movement and performance came naturally to me. I wasn't a particularly good classical dancer, but I know that in my generation I made a contribution to this company and that I was a very useful and felt a very valued member. \"One of my teachers, Miss Edwards said to me, 'If I can compare the company to an orchestra, you're not in among the violins, but you're more like a cello or a bass. Wherever you play you'll always be heard'. \"The drug for us actually is the use of your body to express something. It is a very physical art form, and you are always attempting to get two arms, two legs and a body to serve your purposes. That's an extraordinary feeling: being exhausted, being out of breath and being hot and sweaty is all part of it.\" It is terribly important, she says, that the Royal Ballet has kept its orchestra and does not dance to tapes, which are the same every night, as most other companies now must. Though they spend hours every day drilling the dancers, the point of it all is a sort of spontaneity. She has a strong, lean, sympathetic face, as if it had been out in a desert wind for a long time, but as she talks, I realise this is wrong: it's not that she has been weathered but that she's actually a phoenix, passing on the flame.",

Although women are still five percentage points off parity, Hamilton said the \"city girl\" phenomenon had helped close the gap. Women dominate the top of the list, with Maeve Binchy's Tara Road and JK Rowling's second installment of Harry Potter seeing off Nick Hornby's About A Boy and John Grisham's latest court room saga. Also for the first time this year, the \"city girl\" oeuvre has been elevated to a genre of its own in fastseller lists alongside such esteemed and traditional forms as the novel, thriller and autobiography. Helen Fielding, author of the Bridget Jones books, said the \"city girl\" genre had sprung up because of the gap between what women were expected to be and what they actually were. \"These are complicated times for women. Bridget is groping through the complexities of dealing with relationships and shifting roles while being bombarded with idealised images of modern womanhood.\" Susan Kerr, of the Women Writers Network, said women should not feel guilty about indulging themselves with \"city girl\" type literature. Kerr claimed the key to women authors' new success was that they wrote \"more intimate books that tend to be sensitive to emotions and current issues. Women tend to write more from what they know.\" The Fastseller list, which excludes cookbooks and other such perennial bestsellers as Birdsong and Captain Corelli's Mandolin, is regarded as one of the most reliable indicators in the books industry.",

      "bodyText": "When part of Beachy Head fell into the Channel last year, everyone blamed rising sea levels and storms - nobody fingered the Patella vulgata, otherwise known as the humble limpet. But scientists have worked out that the chalk guzzling gastropods, together with tunneling piddocks and polydora worms, are nibbling away at the soft rocks round our shores year by year, undermining Britain's chalk cliffs and sea defences and whittling away the coastline. Engineers have previously assumed that chalk rocks made sure foundations for concrete sea defences, but Brighton is having to replace sea walls finished only 10 years ago because the foundations are collapsing. The work on the limpet was done by a PhD student, Claire Andrews, at the centre for environmental science, at the University of Sussex, near Brighton. Ms Andrews was following up work done by an obscure Victorian scientist, known only as Hawkshore, who calculated that limpets were reducing the height of the foreshore at Dover by 1.5mm a year. No one believed him. But over three years Ms Andrews collected limpets and measured the calcium carbonate content of their faeces. She came up with the figure of 1.3mm a year in an area where there was a dense limpet population - which is about 30% of the natural erosion thought to be caused by wind and weather and is significant in the continuing issue of coastal erosion. So serious is the problem that the European Union has paid \u00a3660,000 for Sussex to do further research in France, Portugal, Spain and Sweden as well as Britain. Rendel Williams, head of the environmental science department at the University of Sussex, said that as the limpets crept round the rocks eating the algae, they also ate the chalk. They also hollowed out places to rest between tides. By measuring the quantity of chalk in their faeces it was possible to work out the erosion the limpets were causing. \"What on earth made Claire spend three years doing this I have no idea, but the results are very valuable.

Paul Lucas, 37, was feared drowned after he went missing in rough seas during a scuba diving expedition off Australia's east coast on Wednesday. For a day and a night, he was swept along in his wet suit before he managed to swim ashore to the tiny uninhabited Split Solitary island, three miles off the mainland, where he was marooned on the rocks for a further 15 hours. The freelance computer programmer from Leicestershire was finally rescued after being spotted by the crew of a passing leisure cruiser shortly after dawn yesterday. The heavy swells of up to 2 metres high around the island made it impossible for rescuers from Coff's Harbour, 250 miles north of Sydney, to reach him by boat, but police divers managed to swim ashore with water and food before he was plucked to safety by helicopter. Speaking from hospital in Coff's Harbour yesterday, Mr Lucas, who was on a 10-week holiday and had completed only nine previous dives, said: \"I feel sore, but I am just happy that I am not dead.

      "body": "<p>A majority of parents want corporal punishment to be reintroduced in schools to tackle what they perceive is an increasing problem of classroom disorder, according to a poll published yesterday. </p> <p>It showed that two-thirds of parents think discipline has declined over the past 10 years, while only one in 10 believe it has improved. Almost a quarter think disruptive and badly behaved children are the biggest problem facing schools - a higher proportion than those blaming poor teaching, overcrowding or lack of parental support. </p> <p>The opinion poll showed 51% of parents think reintroduction of corporal punishment is the answer to the problem. Among working class parents 60% are in favour, but the proportion falls to 40% among middle class parents. </p> <p>Corporal punishment was abolished 14 years ago throughout all state schools and in the private sector last year. </p> <p>Teachers' leaders said there was no realistic chance of its reintroduction. David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"Parents might want to bring back the cane, but it is not a feasible option. I don't know any head or teachers who want it and it would be in contravention of the European convention on human rights. </p> <p>\"I'm not surprised parents identify bad behaviour in schools as a problem. But schools can only operate within the communities they serve. Indiscipline often results from factors outside the school. A lot of the blame lies not with teachers but with parents.\" </p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"Corporal punishment is off the agenda. It never worked. The discipline problem is a comment on society rather than on schools. Schools work within the context of what happens outside. Children have become less biddable and keeping good discipline in schools has become much harder for teachers.\" </p> <p>The survey of 1,000 parents in England and Wales, conducted by FDS International for the Times Educational Supplement, also found that more than four in five parents think the government spends too little on schools. </p> <p>David Moore, head of behaviour policy at Ofsted, told the North of England education conference in Wigan yesterday that primary schools expelled 300 children a year who were under the age of six. This was 20% of all permanent exclusions from primary schools. Most of these expulsions were for hitting other pupils, fighting or disrupting lessons. </p> <p>Mr Moore said many of the infant troublemakers arrived at school without experience of dealing with any adults other than their own parents. They were likely to leave primary school with a reading age of seven or eight and then struggle to cope at secondary school. Boys were 10 times more likely to be expelled from primary school than girls. \"There are some very damaged children in our schools,\" he said. </p> <p>About 24,000 children aged between two and 18 are receiving psychiatric treatment and 18% of them are in mainstream schools.</p> <p><strong>Discipline or arbitrary violence?</strong></p> <p><strong> For</strong> </p> <p><strong>Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former Conservative MP for Brent North and former headteacher:</strong></p> <p>\"I was caned two or three times when I was at school for minor offences - I took my punishment and it seemed fair.\" </p> <p>\"As far as I am concerned, it is a good form of punishment for boys which instils a sense of discipline. Generally discipline in schools has deteriorated since it was taken away. </p> <p>\"If a boy gets away with violence at school he will continue to get away with it throughout his life unless he is punished. </p> <p>\"I think caning should be brought back to schools that want it so that parents can make up their own minds.\" </p> <p><strong> Against</strong> </p> <p><strong>Dick Davison, joint director of the Independent Schools Information Service:</strong> </p> <p>\"I was caned twice at school - more than 30 years ago - and I was struck by how arbitrary and unjust the whole thing was. </p> <p>\"I was caned at the age of 12 for a fairly serious misdemeanour committed by someone else. The headmaster decided to punish the class by quite literally decimating us. </p> <p>\"Like the Roman army, which punished disgraced regiments by executing the 10th person on the roll, our headteacher chose to cane every seventh person on the register. </p> <p>\"I was unfortunate to be number eight on the register, so I was beaten. At the time I was struck by the injustice, when I was punished for someone else's misdemeanour. The second time was for a trivial offence at boarding school after lights out - which just seemed so pointless.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Interviews by Helen Carter.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A majority of parents want corporal punishment to be reintroduced in schools to tackle what they perceive is an increasing problem of classroom disorder, according to a poll published yesterday. It showed that two-thirds of parents think discipline has declined over the past 10 years, while only one in 10 believe it has improved. Almost a quarter think disruptive and badly behaved children are the biggest problem facing schools - a higher proportion than those blaming poor teaching, overcrowding or lack of parental support. The opinion poll showed 51% of parents think reintroduction of corporal punishment is the answer to the problem. Among working class parents 60% are in favour, but the proportion falls to 40% among middle class parents. Corporal punishment was abolished 14 years ago throughout all state schools and in the private sector last year. Teachers' leaders said there was no realistic chance of its reintroduction. David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"Parents might want to bring back the cane, but it is not a feasible option. I don't know any head or teachers who want it and it would be in contravention of the European convention on human rights. \"I'm not surprised parents identify bad behaviour in schools as a problem. But schools can only operate within the communities they serve. Indiscipline often results from factors outside the school. A lot of the blame lies not with teachers but with parents.\" John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"Corporal punishment is off the agenda. It never worked. The discipline problem is a comment on society rather than on schools. Schools work within the context of what happens outside. Children have become less biddable and keeping good discipline in schools has become much harder for teachers.\" The survey of 1,000 parents in England and Wales, conducted by FDS International for the Times Educational Supplement, also found that more than four in five parents think the government spends too little on schools. David Moore, head of behaviour policy at Ofsted, told the North of England education conference in Wigan yesterday that primary schools expelled 300 children a year who were under the age of six. This was 20% of all permanent exclusions from primary schools. Most of these expulsions were for hitting other pupils, fighting or disrupting lessons. Mr Moore said many of the infant troublemakers arrived at school without experience of dealing with any adults other than their own parents. They were likely to leave primary school with a reading age of seven or eight and then struggle to cope at secondary school. Boys were 10 times more likely to be expelled from primary school than girls. \"There are some very damaged children in our schools,\" he said. About 24,000 children aged between two and 18 are receiving psychiatric treatment and 18% of them are in mainstream schools. Discipline or arbitrary violence? For Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former Conservative MP for Brent North and former headteacher: \"I was caned two or three times when I was at school for minor offences - I took my punishment and it seemed fair.\" \"As far as I am concerned, it is a good form of punishment for boys which instils a sense of discipline. Generally discipline in schools has deteriorated since it was taken away. \"If a boy gets away with violence at school he will continue to get away with it throughout his life unless he is punished. \"I think caning should be brought back to schools that want it so that parents can make up their own minds.\" Against Dick Davison, joint director of the Independent Schools Information Service: \"I was caned twice at school - more than 30 years ago - and I was struck by how arbitrary and unjust the whole thing was. \"I was caned at the age of 12 for a fairly serious misdemeanour committed by someone else. The headmaster decided to punish the class by quite literally decimating us. \"Like the Roman army, which punished disgraced regiments by executing the 10th person on the roll, our headteacher chose to cane every seventh person on the register. \"I was unfortunate to be number eight on the register, so I was beaten. At the time I was struck by the injustice, when I was punished for someone else's misdemeanour. The second time was for a trivial offence at boarding school after lights out - which just seemed so pointless.\" \u0095 Interviews by Helen Carter.",

      "bodyText": "A project in Manchester which allows women to get the morning-after pill from their local pharmacy has been hailed such a success that 50 more pharmacists have asked to become involved. The trial scheme, the first of its kind in Britain, involves 16 pharmacies in the Manchester, Salford and Trafford health action zone. Women usually have to attend hospital casualty departments or visit their doctor or family planning clinic for emergency contraception. The pharmacists involved had to complete a training programme and a contraception course before they could take part in the scheme. Women needing emergency contraception are given a 10-minute consultation with a pharmacist, and asked a series of questions, before being supplied with the pill. Health officials said the scheme has been such a success that at least another 50 pharmacists in Manchester have indicated that they would like to take part. Christine Glover, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: \"We welcome the project, which allows women quicker access to this safe and effective form of emergency contraception, combined with expert care and advice.\" She said the RPS believed it was in the public interest for pharmacists to be given the responsibility of providing emergency contraception. \"Pharmacists are highly trained and already manage the safe supply to the public of many potent medicinal products,\" she added. A spokesman for the health action zone said: \"The initiative was taken as part of the social exclusion report which identified these areas as having some of the highest rates of teenage pregnancies in the country. \"The trust is supportive of any service which makes contraception more accessible to young women.\" The trial scheme is due to finish in March.",

The court will sit for what is believed to be the first time with five judges - rather than the normal three - to decide whether damages for injuries are now too low. The week-long hearing, due to start on February 28, will be presided over by the master of the rolls Lord Woolf, who is head of the appeal court's civil division and the second most senior judge in England and Wales. It will look at around six test cases ranging from the less serious to the most catastrophic injuries suffered in road, work and medical accidents. The move has been prompted by a law commission report last April, which concluded that compensation for pain, suffering and loss of enjoyment of life should be between 50 and 100% higher. Because the case will break new ground, the judges will be advised by an independent lawyer. The outcome will not affect damages for loss of earnings and the cost of long-term care, which make up the bulk of \u00a31m-plus compensation awards for severely disabled accident victims. The judges look only at the element which is hardest to compensate in financial terms - the effect of the injury on the victim in terms of pain, limitations on bodily capacity and inability to enjoy leisure activities. Even the most severe disability, such as permanent paralysis of all four limbs, currently rates only at around \u00a3150,000, under informal tariffs set by judges. The law commission report pointed out that damages are higher in Scotland and typically at least twice as high in Northern Ireland than in England and Wales. The appeal court will be able to lay down new tariffs without the need for legislation. The hearing follows the commission's recommendation that damages would be best increased by the higher courts issuing guidelines in a series of cases.

      "bodyText": "Safeguards for civil service impartiality were yesterday demanded by former senior Whitehall officials and MPs following the Guardian's disclosure of government plans to develop a powerful electronic information and rebuttal system. Leaked cabinet office documents described the aim of the Knowledge Network Project, as it is officially known, as explaining \"the government's core message\" so that the public could get \"the full facts without going through the distorting prism of media reporting\". Critics of the hi-tech project yesterday raised questions about what effect it would have on the impartiality of the civil service and the accountability of government. They expressed fears that a system intended to make the running of government more efficient and professional, could be used for party political purposes. The system, a descendent of the Excalibur database the Labour party successfully used at the 1997 election, opens a new chapter in the relationship between the Labour government and the civil service. The project, devised by Frank Dobson's former spin doctor, Joe McCrea, recommended that the database included the \"best five arguments and the best three facts\" for every key government policy, as well as the \"key quotes, key facts and rapid reaction to attacks on departmental policy and practice\". One former senior cabinet office civil servant, Sir Peter Kemp, told the BBC yesterday: \"The question is whether civil servants and the rest will actually be able, or indeed allowed, to put out totally objective material.\" If the new machinery meant civil servants could not put out the \"four bad facts\" as well as the three good ones, then \"I think we may be in trouble\". The idea of trying to cut out the \"distorting prism of the media\" was mistaken, he said, since it was media reporting that kept democracy alive. Jonathan Baume, head of the civil service union the First Division Association, said that there were clear rules for civil servants and the government's information service, and the Knowledge Network would help modernise work that was already being carried out. However, he warned: \"What would be difficult is if this system was hijacked in some way to be used for party political purposes. The danger would be if people who had access to it, which must clearly include special advisers, would then misuse this information for party purposes.\" The home secretary, Jack Straw, defended the system as a sensible use of new information technology systems, and said it was consistent with traditional political debate.

In 1999 I had only one ambition: to go to this annual happening [a music festival] in the Nevada desert; this year my sole ambition is to go back, not to see but to participate in the temporary realisation of a utopian ideal, to show - like Auden in 1939 - an affirming flame.\" </p> <p> <strong>Anna Ford</strong> Newsreader </p> <p> \"Solving the debt of the third world.

Yet we're still intact and doing rather well. This will be a great year for putting a few superstitions to rest. The year will also see a long overdue fightback against parental paranoia - helping those responsible for families to realise they can raise them adequately without constant interference from politicians, state agencies and self-appointed experts.\" </p> <p><strong>Daniel Goldhagen</strong> Historian </p> <p> \"The small things in life can bring cheer, no matter what the big things might bring: the laugh of one's child in the morning, the joke of a colleague at noon, putting a room in order after work, an hour with a good book in the evening, a kiss from a loved one at night. In this respect 2000 is no different from any other year.\" </p> <p><strong>Sally Greengross</strong> Age Concern </p> <p> \"Older people should look forward to this millennium with great optimism. Demographic changes mean they cannot be ignored. There will soon be nearly 12 million older people in the UK who can claim the state pension, and I hope those extra voices may lead to a more \"age-neutral\" Britain, where people are valued as individuals and not devalued simply because of their age. This should be the new call of all older people: we have a lot to shout about, and we need to find our voices.\" </p> <p><strong>Oliver James</strong> Clinical psychologist </p> <p> \"No more Thatcher as PM, the cold war is over and the Tory press have not yet spotted how New Labour is secretly redistributing wealth - for example, 3.5% stamp duty for house purchases over \u00a3500k.\" </p> <p><strong>Ben Pimlott</strong> Warden, Goldsmiths College </p> <p> \"I am hopeful that life in the West will stay much as it is. People talk about the speed of change, but the odd feature of the second half of the 20th century (in contrast to the first half) has been an expectation of stability. In the last 50 years, peace, growing prosperity and improving social welfare have come to be seen as the natural order. Sooner or later, there will be a return to the normal pattern of war, pestilence and famine, but there is no strong reason to think that the present run of luck will change immediately. To this extent, I'm optimistic.\" </p> <p><strong>Mary Robinson</strong>Director, Amnesty International UK </p> <p> \"One of the strangest anomalies of the 20th century has been that a person responsible for killing people in their thousands was less likely to be brought to justice than someone responsible for a single murder.

In 1999 I had only one ambition: to go to this annual happening [a music festival] in the Nevada desert; this year my sole ambition is to go back, not to see but to participate in the temporary realisation of a utopian ideal, to show - like Auden in 1939 - an affirming flame.\" Anna Ford Newsreader \"Solving the debt of the third world. And I think our daughters are going to have a chance of greater equality than women have had in the last century. And I detect a kindness, in terms of less materialism, and greater pleasure in the simple things of life - like talking, and just being, really.\" Frank Furedi Sociologist \"We have spent so much energy refusing to face up to the promise of the Enlightenment that we even invented an insect to symbolise the transition from the last millennium to this one. Yet we're still intact and doing rather well. This will be a great year for putting a few superstitions to rest. The year will also see a long overdue fightback against parental paranoia - helping those responsible for families to realise they can raise them adequately without constant interference from politicians, state agencies and self-appointed experts.\" Daniel Goldhagen Historian \"The small things in life can bring cheer, no matter what the big things might bring: the laugh of one's child in the morning, the joke of a colleague at noon, putting a room in order after work, an hour with a good book in the evening, a kiss from a loved one at night. In this respect 2000 is no different from any other year.\" Sally Greengross Age Concern \"Older people should look forward to this millennium with great optimism. Demographic changes mean they cannot be ignored. There will soon be nearly 12 million older people in the UK who can claim the state pension, and I hope those extra voices may lead to a more \"age-neutral\" Britain, where people are valued as individuals and not devalued simply because of their age. This should be the new call of all older people: we have a lot to shout about, and we need to find our voices.\" Oliver James Clinical psychologist \"No more Thatcher as PM, the cold war is over and the Tory press have not yet spotted how New Labour is secretly redistributing wealth - for example, 3.5% stamp duty for house purchases over \u00a3500k.\" Ben Pimlott Warden, Goldsmiths College \"I am hopeful that life in the West will stay much as it is. People talk about the speed of change, but the odd feature of the second half of the 20th century (in contrast to the first half) has been an expectation of stability. In the last 50 years, peace, growing prosperity and improving social welfare have come to be seen as the natural order. Sooner or later, there will be a return to the normal pattern of war, pestilence and famine, but there is no strong reason to think that the present run of luck will change immediately. To this extent, I'm optimistic.\" Mary RobinsonDirector, Amnesty International UK \"One of the strangest anomalies of the 20th century has been that a person responsible for killing people in their thousands was less likely to be brought to justice than someone responsible for a single murder. One of the great challenges of the first years of the millennium lies in setting up the International Criminal Court in a way that ensures that this anomaly does not follow us into the new century.\" Elaine Showalter Academic \"1) The second season of The Sopranos airs in January 2) Sylvia Plath's lost second novel might turn up 3) If Linda Tripp can look good, there's hope for all of us 4) John Cleese as the New Q 5) The Paddington-Heathrow Express.\" Peter Tatchell Gay rights campaigner \"Ken Livingstone will be mayor of London by the summer. The Human Rights Act will come into force and give new protection against the abuse of state power, and global warming will mean I may soon be able to grow bananas on my balcony at Elephant and Castle.\" \u0095 Interviews by Andy Ajiz, Oliver Burkeman and Merope Mills",

That is the \"experiment\" being conducted in British agriculture. </p> <p>On the likely outcome, opinion is sharply divided. In one camp are the vast majority of the conventional scientific community, the agricultural establishment and most of the cabinet. Their position has been \"You can't provide a scrap of evidence showing any significant differences between the quality of organic and intensively produced food. In fact all the indications are that public health has never been better.\" But a growing percentage of the public feels that food grown without chemical fertilisers and pesticides must be healthier. This intuition is supported anecdotally by organic farmers convinced by observation of a direct link between the method of production and the health of crops and livestock. </p> <p>Today at a conference entitled The Renaissance of Farming at the Royal Agricultural College, in Cirencester, Danish and German researchers will present new evidence suggesting that there are qualitative differences between organic and conventional foods derived directly from the method of primary production. In the light of this evidence surely even sceptics should acknowledge the urgent need for further research in this field? <br> Yours, Patrick Holden, Director, the Soil Association </p> <p> <strong> Dear Patrick,</strong> <br> The only difference between \"organic\" and conventional food is that organic food uses fewer synthetic chemicals. As a result, organic crops tend to have lower yields, so that more land must be used in their production for the same output and they are more expensive. To make up for this, organic farmers often use manure, which if improperly treated may contain high levels of the deadly bacterium E coli 0157:H7. </p> <p>Organic food is also more likely to perish during transport and storage because of a reluctance to use preservatives. Many organic enthusiasts justify their reluctance to use synthetic chemicals on the now discredited grounds that they are carcinogenic. It is true that rodents given high doses of certain synthetic pesticides contract cancer. But the same is true for about half of all chemicals, including many found naturally in foods such as broccoli and oranges. We survive because the human immune system is able to deal with low doses of carcinogens. </p> <p>Pesticide residues on food are not poisonous. The level of carcinogens from pesticides present in all the fruit and vegetables we consume in a year is approximately the same as the level of carcinogens in one cup of coffee. Fresh fruit and vegetables contain immune-boosting chemicals that enable us to fight cancer, so more cheap fresh fruit and vegetables improve our health regardless of the tiny amounts of pesticide residues that might remain. <br> Yours, Julian Morris, Institute of Economic Affairs, Editor, Fearing Food (Butterworth-Heinemann) </p> <p><strong> Dear Julian,</strong><br> I am surprised that your response manages to incorporate so many of the key misconceptions conventional scientists tend to make about organic farming. Your assertion that the only difference between organic and conventional food is the absence of synthetic chemicals misses the most important attribute of organic farming - that it promotes healthy plants and natural pest control. </p> <p>An organically farmed world might mean a little more land in agricultural production. But don't forget that wildlife and biodiversity can co-exist with organic farming - not the case with high-input intensive monocropping. You also have it wrong on manures. Organic standards only permit the use of manures from animals on the organic holding or brought-in manure from extensive farming systems, both of which must be thoroughly composted before use, virtually eliminating the risk of any pathogenic bacteria in the crops. </p> <p>The Environmental Protection Agency attributes 220,000 deaths a year to pesticide poisoning. Neither you nor I have any idea about what the long-term effect of consuming small traces of pesticides will be over decades, even in trace quantities. As for your last point, the latest research from Denmark suggests that organic production systems actually increase their presence, giving organic food stronger anti-cancer properties than its conventional equivalent. <br> Yours, Patrick </p> <p><strong> Dear Patrick,</strong><br> Talk about misconceptions. First, organic farmers do engage in artifi cial stimulation of growth and chemical suppression of disease. They use copper sulphate and lime, a pesticide that kills indiscriminately, and they stimulate with shit, which contains an assortment of unpleasant chemicals. Is it good enough \"virtually\" to eliminate bacteria through composting? And what about the 70% of organic food imported to the UK, much of it subject to less rigorous procedures than those of the Soil Association? Conventional farmers use a far broader array of chemical pesticides, many of which kill only a few target pests, and use fertilisers that target nutrient deficiencies without spreading disease. </p> <p>Second, there is more biological diversity in a few acres of wilderness than in a million square miles of organic cropland. Third, nobody has ever died as a result of consuming pesticide residues on food, nor are they likely to. According to the World Health Organisation, over 90% of pesticide deaths are suicides; a further 7% are the result of household poisoning; the remaining few are the result of careless application. Many foods contain far higher levels of toxic natural pesticides than anything added by man. </p> <p>Fourth, most studies have found no significant nutritional benefits from organic food; some have found the opposite. To adapt an old saying, \"manure in, manure out\". </p> <p>Yours, Julian </p> <p><strong> Dear Julian,</strong><br> Your depiction of organic farming as entailing crude 19th-century practices is a serious distortion of the principles and practices which govern it. Surely the challenge confronting agriculture is to develop systems which produce healthy food, using a minimum of non-renewable inputs and to do so without polluting, destroying wildlife, eroding soils or compromising food safety. Our contention is that organic farming is the best developed prescription which meets these objectives. The alternative is a brave new world of technologies with unquantifiable risks. </p> <p>However, your points still need a rebuttal: copper sulphate will be phased out of organic standards by 2003; lime is not a pesticide but a means of neutralising soil acidity; animal manures have acquired their \"unhealthy\" image largely because the bacteria and toxic residues they contain are the direct result of industrialised production; organic standards are remarkably consistent globally. </p> <p>Your advocacy of target-killing and fertilisers and the separation of food production from the preservation of biodiversity epitomises the current \"food factories and parks\" attitude that prevails in conventional science. This is the reverse of the organic philosophy. On your points about pesticide poisoning and food quality, we could trade further statistics on this but we have not yet had time to fully assess the effects of intensive farming on human health. What is beyond dispute is that more and more residues are finding a way into our food. Lady Eve Balfour, who founded the Soil Association in 1946, suggested that farmers should focus their attention on promoting what she called \"the causes of health\". She was right then and she still is today. <br> Yours, Patrick </p> <p><strong> Dear Patrick,</strong><br> Organic farming is less healthy and less sustainable then conventional agriculture. In most developed countries, age-corrected rates of death from nearly all cancers have been falling for the past 40 years. This in spite of widespread use of synthetic pesticides and fertiliser. The simple explanation is that they increase output, reducing the cost of fresh fruit and vegetables, which help protect against cancer. Forty years should surely be long enough to show a causal relationship between pesticide and cancer if one existed; yet none has been shown. With our relatively high incomes, you and I can spend a little more on our sprouts and potatoes and buy \"organic\" if we don't mind a bit of E coli, listeria, or aflatoxin. The vast majority, however, have no such luxury. For them, cheaper is better. </p> <p>I'm glad you are phasing out copper sulphate. But I am worried that instead of permitting organic farmers to use better, more specific pesticides, you will force them to rely more heavily on carnivorous insects, which are more difficult to control. You will no doubt ban the use of such insects too. Unfortunately, such bans reduce the scope for farmers to develop better techniques aiming to combine the best of chemical and biological pest control. A move to organic farming is a move back to the days of our forebears when the masses had no choice but to eat the decaying and disease-ridden cast-offs of the elite. <br> Yours, Julian </p> <p>\u0095 Join the debate and have your say at <a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/debate\">www.newsunlimited.co.uk/debate</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Oasis are calling their forthcoming album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants, a title that manages to be both self-deprecating and self-indicting. If the sound of Oasis represents the full roar of rock'n' roll at the beginning of the new century, the album might more accurately be called Standing in the Shadow of Giants, since the Beatles, and John Lennon in particular, continue to exercise an obsessive hold on the Gallagher brothers' creative psyches. </p> <p>Four albums into their stride, it will be interesting to hear if Liam and Noel have cast off the cloak of homage-cum-pastiche that still characterises their often excellent, but essentially traditional, pop-rock bluster. Oasis are only the loudest and most visible example of rock's protracted post-mid-life crisis, and at least Liam has a punk swagger about him that runs counter to the middle-class artiness of the group's nearest rivals. But the fact remains that nearly 50 years on from the shock of the new that was Presley, Little Richard and the rest, rock music has struggled and generally failed to transcend its core influences, to such a degree that pastiche has been elevated to the ultimate pop art form. </p> <p>Beck, the great white hope of American rock, has just made the best Prince album in recent years, and already seems defeated by the weight of expectation he has had to carry since his startling debut. It is unlikely that pop culture will ever again produce anyone with the iconic resonance of a Dylan or a Lennon or a Lou Reed. It may well produce songwriters of an equal or even better calibre, but the social context that threw up the giants of pop is long gone - replaced by mass entertainment, by vulgar hype and the hard sell, by self-congratulatory awards ceremonies. </p> <p>Right now, ironically, we have greater access to rock history than ever before. In the past few years every overlooked genius, from Gram Parsons to Nick Drake, from Gene Clarke to Arthur Lee, from Sun Ra to Lee Perry, has been excavated and re-appraised - and most of the time the present has been found wanting in relation to the richness, and indeed the strangeness, of the past. To listen to the Dylan Bootlegs series, to the exhaustive Byrds, Velvet Underground and Marvin Gaye box sets that have arrived over the past decade is not just to hear pop history but also, in places, to approach the realm of myth. </p> <p>Rock'n'roll at its most potent is, like cinema or photography (the other two great pop art forms of the 20th century) essentially mythic.

      "bodyText": "Oasis are calling their forthcoming album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants, a title that manages to be both self-deprecating and self-indicting. If the sound of Oasis represents the full roar of rock'n' roll at the beginning of the new century, the album might more accurately be called Standing in the Shadow of Giants, since the Beatles, and John Lennon in particular, continue to exercise an obsessive hold on the Gallagher brothers' creative psyches. Four albums into their stride, it will be interesting to hear if Liam and Noel have cast off the cloak of homage-cum-pastiche that still characterises their often excellent, but essentially traditional, pop-rock bluster. Oasis are only the loudest and most visible example of rock's protracted post-mid-life crisis, and at least Liam has a punk swagger about him that runs counter to the middle-class artiness of the group's nearest rivals. But the fact remains that nearly 50 years on from the shock of the new that was Presley, Little Richard and the rest, rock music has struggled and generally failed to transcend its core influences, to such a degree that pastiche has been elevated to the ultimate pop art form. Beck, the great white hope of American rock, has just made the best Prince album in recent years, and already seems defeated by the weight of expectation he has had to carry since his startling debut. It is unlikely that pop culture will ever again produce anyone with the iconic resonance of a Dylan or a Lennon or a Lou Reed. It may well produce songwriters of an equal or even better calibre, but the social context that threw up the giants of pop is long gone - replaced by mass entertainment, by vulgar hype and the hard sell, by self-congratulatory awards ceremonies. Right now, ironically, we have greater access to rock history than ever before. In the past few years every overlooked genius, from Gram Parsons to Nick Drake, from Gene Clarke to Arthur Lee, from Sun Ra to Lee Perry, has been excavated and re-appraised - and most of the time the present has been found wanting in relation to the richness, and indeed the strangeness, of the past. To listen to the Dylan Bootlegs series, to the exhaustive Byrds, Velvet Underground and Marvin Gaye box sets that have arrived over the past decade is not just to hear pop history but also, in places, to approach the realm of myth. Rock'n'roll at its most potent is, like cinema or photography (the other two great pop art forms of the 20th century) essentially mythic. That is why Greil Marcus's book, Mystery Train, which places its extended musical portraits in the context of a fast-fading mythical America, remains the best study of the subject. Dylan circa 1966 - like Scorsese in the early 70s - was a myth-maker.

      "body": "<p>The European City of Culture is one of the most successful initiatives ever undertaken by the European commission. We may debate the euro, we may argue over national sovereignty, but what city wouldn't want to be European City of Culture? There is such a backlog of applicants that this year, with the excuse of marking the millennium, the Commission has named nine Cities of Culture, not just in member states but also in what it euphemistically calls \"European third countries\". Prague and Krakow get to join Bergen, Avignon, Bologna, Reykjavik, Helsinki, Santiago de Compostela and Brussels as this year's European Cities of Culture. </p> <p>The Scandinavian-Mediterranean-Mitteleuropean smorgasbord of events on offer includes the streets of Avignon being decorated by Christian Lacroix, a son et lumi\u00e8re event devised by Peter Greenaway in Bologna and a festival of Baltic herring in Helsinki. There's something going on here, and we all know what it is. Every politician has learned to praise culture because nowadays we all know about the service sector and the postmodern economy. In the economy of Europe at the beginning of the 21st century it is culture that makes the wheels go round. It smooths the path: Prague, one of the chosen nine, will also play host this year to meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. As a communiqu\u00e9 from Britain's department for culture, media and sport puts it - while urging British cities to apply for our allotted turn in 2008 - \"culture is central to the life of a city, given the demonstrable links it has with regeneration, social inclusion, education and business\". </p> <p>The European City of Culture was born at the moment when we became aware of the city again as a place of culture, style and artistic excellence, when the world economy was changing and industrial production was less of a boast than nice squares and art galleries. The scheme was proposed by Melina Mercouri, then Greek culture minister, in 1984. This was the time when one city after another was learning to define itself by its culture, to promote itself as a tourist destination and artistic centre. It's a process that has become routine now, with cheap flights to European cities and the dissolution of the Soviet bloc; you can discover the culture of any city from Dundee (vibrant in visual art) to Reykjavik (Bj\u00f6rk!) in a weekend. Back then it was all very new. Cities that had been neglected suddenly emerged as great European centres. Barcelona, Seville and Glasgow reinvented themselves. </p> <p>This new idea of the city belongs to the end of the industrial era. From Charles Dickens to Francis Bacon, the Victorian and modern idea of the city was of a dehumanising, ugly wasteland. The phrase \"city of culture\" would have made a Victorian laugh, and TS Eliot weep, unless you were talking about the great cities of the past that the industrial city so failed to emulate - Venice, Florence, Athens. In the 20th century the modernist city of tower blocks was imagined as the opposite of the cultured past - Poisonville, as a city is called in Dashiell Hammett's novel Red Harvest. </p> <p>The early-21st-century city no longer feels insecure. Service industries and new living habits mean the city is soft, cultural. It's a fiction, of course. Poverty, bad housing, poor transport, homelessness give it the lie. But it's an enormously seductive fiction that has enabled cities to re-imagine themselves as cosmopolitan, cappuccino-saturated paradises. Renaissance Florence? We can compete with that. </p> <p>The City of Culture scheme makes this new sense of the city explicit. It claims a direct continuity between the great civilised European cities of the past and the cities of today. It insists that culture can shape our cities just as it shaped Athens in the time of Sophocles, and Florence in the age of Michelangelo. That's why it was so apposite that Athens was the first City of Culture in 1985, followed by Florence in 1986. </p> <p>And yet the roster of recent Cities of Culture is scarcely a list of the most avant-garde centres of creativity in Europe. Copenhagen (1996), Thessaloniki (1997), Stockholm (1998) - the City of Culture scheme has become a way for cities to try to latch on to the Barcelona phenomenon, but there's a false, clumsy feeling to the whole thing. Last year's city was Weimar, the city of Goethe and the Bauhaus, but also part of the former DDR. Clearly it was made City of Culture as a leg-up initiative. Its main event was a top-heavy examination of modern art that caused controversy by seeming to equate Nazi art and the art of the DDR. There was no sense of the city projecting itself outwards, like Glasgow in 1990. </p> <p>\"Ah, Glasgow\", you can almost hear politicians sigh. \"Most people agree that Glasgow in 1990 was the most successful designation since the scheme began,\" said Chris Smith earlier this year when he announced that Britain is to nominate a new city as Capital of Culture in 2008 (the scheme is being renamed Capital of Culture, an upgrade from City, from 2005). Glasgow is the one City of Culture everyone can name. It made a big international eye-catching event of the opportunity. But to be a successful City of Culture - to be a successful player in the new global economy - you have to suppress your real culture and sanitise yourself for others' eyes. </p> <p>The Glasgow celebrated by the City of Culture was all art-nouveau tea shops and Peter Brook, with little reference to the actual culture of the city, which in 1990 included James Kelman's splenetic Dostoevskian novels of working-class life and Jerry Sadowitz's vicious comedy, cultural phenomena that reflect the city's texture. \"Glaswegians are warm people with a tremendous sense of self-deprecating humour, and their personalities are reflected in the astonishing variety of pubs, wine bars and other places of conviviality,\" says an official website still promoting Glasgow as City of Culture. </p> <p>Being City of Culture does not change real social conditions. It replaces them with an illusion: the dream that any city, however poor its suburbs, however dilapidated its infrastructure, can be \"regenerated\" by culture. What this does is produce two cities, one city for business travellers, weekenders and cultural connoisseurs and another for the people who live there. </p> <p>Culture is Europe's answer to Starbucks. Rioters in Seattle smashed branches of Starbucks because the cosy coffee empire was a symbol not just of the global economy but of the vacuous post-grunge culture of Clinton's USA. In European cities the idea that culture is the way to bring in businesses by making your dingy town more habitable means that art and theatre are no longer valued for themselves but as assets. This is why the actual contents of this year's celebrations in the nine Cities of Culture are so nebulous. It doesn't matter what precise artistic happenings you have, so long as there are enough of them over the year to justify that precious title. It's culture in the abstract that is being celebrated, the one thing every European can get behind. </p> <p> You can't plan for great art, and if the history of Europe has taught us anything it is that cultural excellence has nothing to do with social well-being or economic stability. The biggest European cultural revolutions have been during wars. The Romantic movement took place during the Napoleonic wars and gave birth to modern nationalism. Russian art and writing nurtured the Russian Revolution. Whoever said that art was about \"getting the best possible results from cultural regeneration\", as Chris Smith said in praising the scheme? </p> <p>Harry Lime put it better in The Third Man, in a ferris wheel above war-ruined Vienna: \"In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed. They produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.\" European culture is steeped in blood and war. It is not a benign archive of great achievements that can be sealed off from the horrors of history. Europe's culture can only be understood, can only be enjoyed, if you see it for what it is - part of that long, tortured history. Nor is art a universal good. Art can do harm. The Italian futurists provided an aesthetic for Italian fascism; Ezra Pound ended the second world war in a PoW camp as a fascist propagandist. Pound's poetry is full of the love of European culture, especially the Cantos he wrote behind bars. </p> <p>The only people who think culture is a universal force for good are politicians and bad artists. The driving force of European art since the first world war has been a suspicion that art is worthless and culture a bourgeois lie. The dadaists attacked \"culture\" as something people wage war for; Samuel Beckett reduced what can be called art to almost nothing. \"There is no document of civilisation which is not at the same time a document of barbarism,\" said Walter Benjamin. Where is this modern European sensibility in the City of Culture scheme? Politely swept under the carpet. </p> <p>Franz Kafka is being celebrated as a cultural icon this year with an exhibition about him in Prague - Kafka, who walked around the city full of agony, imagining himself being thrown out of a window by his furious father. Would he have been pleased by his elevation, or would he have sat in the corner starving himself to death amid this cultural glut?</p>",

      "body": "<p>Depression caused by winter's dark days is called \"seasonal affective disorder,\" the apt and expressive acronym for which is Sad. In the great majority of cases relief is afforded by a daily half-hour exposure to bright light. Most sufferers are women, and the complaint seems to be genetic. Ordinary light bulbs do not help; the light must be intense and broad spectrum (but not full spectrum, because harmful ultra-violet is best excluded.) </p> <p>The theory is that melatonin, which regulates sleep and mood, is over-produced by prolonged darkness, and broad spectrum light suppresses it. One can likewise alter one's internal clock in jet-lag by adjusting melatonin levels. </p> <p>Sad is a winter disease - \"See, Winter comes to rule the varied year,/ Sullen and Sad\" wrote James Thompson. It is also a geographical one: not surprisingly, far more people suffer from it in Alaska than Florida, but the reason is not solely the number of photons available in each place. The ancient Egyptians saw their god every day and felt his power on their backs - Ra, the Sun - and one has only to compare the giant oranges of Florida with their nonexistence in Alaska to see what such a god can do. </p> <p>With light comes warmth, loose clothing, freer movement, more exercise, and the avocations of summer: sea, and sails dotted upon it, the cry of gulls, ice cream, bikinis, sand between the toes: in short, everything calculated to cheer one up. The contrast with dark bleak mornings and the onset of night in mid-afternoon, all horizons closed and everything muffled, could not be sharper. </p> <p>\"Let us love winter, for it is the spring of genius,\" said Pietro Aretino; and only an Italian could say such a thing. In the far north, where humans first undoubtedly went, not for love of cold and dark, but to escape the danger of other humans, the sunless months are long and many. </p> <p>Suppose it to be true that humanity's first home was hot, strongly lit, riotous with vivid tropical colours and luscious scents; what deep instincts are forced to lie dormant in a silent world of snow, where night never ends? Jacques Maritain says, \"What makes man most unhappy is to be deprived not of that which he had, but of that which he did not have, and did not really know.\" That makes Sad a genetic yearning for Eden. </p> <p>Clinical depression - as opposed to the minor fluctuations of mood for which Dodie Smith bracingly recommends \"noble deeds and hot baths\" as the best cures - is a serious illness, requiring careful and sympathetic treatment. Sad is a form of clinical depression, although happily for suffers its cause is clear and its cure easy for most. </p> <p>But between the normal ups and downs and the serious medical condition there is a state which, inevitably and appropriately, visits every inhabitant of the human condition. The Greek tragedians, in characteristic Eeyore vein, are apt to overstate it: \"Fate finds for every man/His share of misery,\" Euripides says; but the state in question is not misery or grief, but a kind of melancholy, in which it is possible to feel and understand things not available in other moods - for our moods are like tunings on the wireless, picking up truths at different frequencies, so that if we do not know the gamut of human feelings, neither can we know the gamut of truth. </p> <p>Such melancholy is fitted to the fact that life offers causes for regret, that happiness is not always the point, and that there is enough hardship and struggle to go round, but not enough of the good things; and reflection on these useful insights is a check on thoughtlessness and self-satisfaction - what the Russians expressively call \"poshlost\" - which threaten to make one live in banal fashion. So a little depression is good at times, in any season. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Depression caused by winter's dark days is called \"seasonal affective disorder,\" the apt and expressive acronym for which is Sad. In the great majority of cases relief is afforded by a daily half-hour exposure to bright light. Most sufferers are women, and the complaint seems to be genetic. Ordinary light bulbs do not help; the light must be intense and broad spectrum (but not full spectrum, because harmful ultra-violet is best excluded.) The theory is that melatonin, which regulates sleep and mood, is over-produced by prolonged darkness, and broad spectrum light suppresses it. One can likewise alter one's internal clock in jet-lag by adjusting melatonin levels. Sad is a winter disease - \"See, Winter comes to rule the varied year,/ Sullen and Sad\" wrote James Thompson. It is also a geographical one: not surprisingly, far more people suffer from it in Alaska than Florida, but the reason is not solely the number of photons available in each place. The ancient Egyptians saw their god every day and felt his power on their backs - Ra, the Sun - and one has only to compare the giant oranges of Florida with their nonexistence in Alaska to see what such a god can do. With light comes warmth, loose clothing, freer movement, more exercise, and the avocations of summer: sea, and sails dotted upon it, the cry of gulls, ice cream, bikinis, sand between the toes: in short, everything calculated to cheer one up. The contrast with dark bleak mornings and the onset of night in mid-afternoon, all horizons closed and everything muffled, could not be sharper. \"Let us love winter, for it is the spring of genius,\" said Pietro Aretino; and only an Italian could say such a thing. In the far north, where humans first undoubtedly went, not for love of cold and dark, but to escape the danger of other humans, the sunless months are long and many. Suppose it to be true that humanity's first home was hot, strongly lit, riotous with vivid tropical colours and luscious scents; what deep instincts are forced to lie dormant in a silent world of snow, where night never ends? Jacques Maritain says, \"What makes man most unhappy is to be deprived not of that which he had, but of that which he did not have, and did not really know.\" That makes Sad a genetic yearning for Eden. Clinical depression - as opposed to the minor fluctuations of mood for which Dodie Smith bracingly recommends \"noble deeds and hot baths\" as the best cures - is a serious illness, requiring careful and sympathetic treatment. Sad is a form of clinical depression, although happily for suffers its cause is clear and its cure easy for most. But between the normal ups and downs and the serious medical condition there is a state which, inevitably and appropriately, visits every inhabitant of the human condition. The Greek tragedians, in characteristic Eeyore vein, are apt to overstate it: \"Fate finds for every man/His share of misery,\" Euripides says; but the state in question is not misery or grief, but a kind of melancholy, in which it is possible to feel and understand things not available in other moods - for our moods are like tunings on the wireless, picking up truths at different frequencies, so that if we do not know the gamut of human feelings, neither can we know the gamut of truth. Such melancholy is fitted to the fact that life offers causes for regret, that happiness is not always the point, and that there is enough hardship and struggle to go round, but not enough of the good things; and reflection on these useful insights is a check on thoughtlessness and self-satisfaction - what the Russians expressively call \"poshlost\" - which threaten to make one live in banal fashion. So a little depression is good at times, in any season.",

      "body": "<p>Almost 100 young mothers formed a rainbow of saris outside Pushta Road health centre in one of the poorest parts of east Delhi this week. Each carried a warmly wrapped infant waiting to be given two drops of oral vaccine from a small plastic vial - a scene that will be repeated at 650,000 immunisation points across India a fortnight from now.</p> <p>More than 125m children are confidently expected to be immunised in India on January 23 alone. More than 125m have already been vaccinated on one day in each of the past three months as part of this huge health initiative.</p> <p>Man has only ever succeeded in eradicating one disease: smallpox. By the end of this year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) hopes a second will be gone.</p> <p>The doctor squirting the vaccine at Pushta Road was Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, director general of WHO. She immunised half a dozen children for the TV cameras. Last year 470m children worldwide - two-thirds of all children under five - were immunised in the campaign.</p> <p>It is 12 years since the World Health Assembly set 2000 as the target date for the eradication of the disease. In 1988 there were an estimated 350,000 cases of polio round the world. Last year there were little more than 5,000. The Indian subcontinent accounts for about 70%.</p> <p>Pushta Road explains why India has such a high number. The health centre serves a community of 42,000 people. Most live in temporary shacks along the nearby motorway and rail line. Open sewers run through the shanty settlements, a perfect conduit for polio. The disease is caused by a virus and spread through faeces-contaminated water.</p> <p>Polio can strike at any age but mainly affects children under three. It usually enters through the mouth and multiplies in the intestines. Once established, it can enter the bloodstream and invade the central nervous system, causing acute paralysis.</p> <p><b>The 'silent virus'</b></p> <p>Five decades ago in the western world, polio was a serious threat. It brought dread to communities, and swimming pools were closed to stop it spreading. In Britain, thousands were paralysed in the first two decades after the second world war.</p> <p>The only treatment was the \"iron lung\", a coffin-like metal cylinder that helped paralysed people to breathe. Not until the late 50s were the first effective vaccines introduced. Eradication in the west followed. The last British outbreak was 40 years ago.</p> <p>But in developing countries, where there were diseases with higher mortality rates, polio was not a priority. Even WHO was wary of eradication programmes. Until smallpox, there had been only failures; with malaria, hookworm, yellow fever.</p> <p>The 10-year smallpox offensive began in 1966 to combat up to 15m cases in 44 countries. This time, eradication was achieved - and only one year past the deadline.</p> <p>Polio shares some of the characteristics that allowed smallpox to be wiped out: a virus restricted to humans and not carried by animals or insects; lifelong immunity once a person is properly vaccinated; an effective vaccine.</p> <p>But there were differences that made polio a bigger challenge. Anyone could see the signs of smallpox on the skin; polio is known as the \"silent virus\". Only one in 200 people who have it may develop paralysis. No one knows why. With one particular strain, it is one in 1,000.</p> <p>Moreover, polio needs at least four doses of vaccine, preferably in the first year, and the vaccine requires refrigeration. But compared to smallpox, there is one advantage: the polio vaccine does not require an injection. The two drops can be delivered by non-medical people.</p> <p>No country has had a bigger challenge than India in such a health initiative. More than 25m babies are born every year. How do you immunise such huge numbers?</p> <p>It was the local Rotarians who helped persuade Indian officials to hold a national immunisation day. The officials were dubious. There are a billion people, three religions: Friday is a holy day for Muslims; Tuesday for Hindus; Sunday for Christians. Many villages lack electricity for refrigeration.</p> <p>In 1994 it was decided to try Delhi first. Sunday was chosen when the schools were empty and could be used as immunisation posts. The drive succeeded and officials were persuaded to go for a national day the next year. That succeeded too.</p> <p>The logistics are intimidating. The day begins at 9am and requires 650,000 immunisation posts. Some 2.6m people are involved in the organisation, only 200,000 of them health officials. By sunset on last month's national immunisation day, more than 134m children had been vaccinated.</p> <p>In urban areas, a polio army of secondary-school students helps get the children to the vaccination centres in schools, temples, churches, public squares. Mobilising the community begins weeks before the day, using radio, television, billboards, schools and pulpits.</p> <p>The national \"cold chain\" to keep the vaccine cool is equally daunting. Dairy companies and other firms with walk-in refrigerators are coopted. Mountains of ice are used in ice-packs and cool boxes. Transport ranges, according to WHO, from camel trains to helicopters.</p> <p>The aim of these national days is to create a wall of immunity that the virus cannot penetrate. The virus can multiply only in humans. With no one to infect, the virus dies. The dramatic drop in cases after national immunisation days on two consecutive months prompted India to try for four. In the words of one official, it was like organising four national elections, each needing at least a 90% turnout.</p> <p>Already 18 out of the 32 Indian states are polio-free. The two states with the most cases, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, are having six immunisation days.</p> <p>Yet national vaccine days are only one prong in the polio campaign. There is also routine immunisation at local health centres. Then come the supplementary doses after national immunisation days. And there is surveillance to pinpoint and isolate any new cases, and mopping up: house-to-house visits in affected areas to ensure every child is immunised.</p> <p><b>Posters on Afghan tanks</b></p> <p>Will WHO make it by the end of the year? Jon Andrus, who oversaw the final stages of polio eradication in the Americas, is impressed with India's speed in setting up its surveillance system. China took four years; India has done it in one.</p> <p>On the other hand, say deadline sceptics, Africa has 30% of the world's cases, but a number of its vaccination campaigns have been disrupted by wars.</p> <p>Bruce Aylward, global co-ordinator for WHO, was optimistic in Delhi this week. He pointed to three African states where ceasefires were negotiated in the past year to allow immunisation days. He has a picture of a Taliban tank in Afghanistan plastered with posters urging parents to have their children immunised.</p> <p>Dr Brundtland points to the progress so far. When the campaign began 12 years ago, 1,000 children a day were being paralysed by polio; today the number is down to 30. \"So long as a single child remains infected with polio\", she says, \"children everywhere are at risk.\"</p> <p><b>Other health battlefronts</b></p> <p><b> Eradication and control projects:</b></p> <p>\u0095<b> Guinea worm</b> Expected to be the next disease wiped out.

      "bodyText": "Almost 100 young mothers formed a rainbow of saris outside Pushta Road health centre in one of the poorest parts of east Delhi this week. Each carried a warmly wrapped infant waiting to be given two drops of oral vaccine from a small plastic vial - a scene that will be repeated at 650,000 immunisation points across India a fortnight from now. More than 125m children are confidently expected to be immunised in India on January 23 alone. More than 125m have already been vaccinated on one day in each of the past three months as part of this huge health initiative. Man has only ever succeeded in eradicating one disease: smallpox. By the end of this year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) hopes a second will be gone. The doctor squirting the vaccine at Pushta Road was Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, director general of WHO. She immunised half a dozen children for the TV cameras. Last year 470m children worldwide - two-thirds of all children under five - were immunised in the campaign. It is 12 years since the World Health Assembly set 2000 as the target date for the eradication of the disease. In 1988 there were an estimated 350,000 cases of polio round the world. Last year there were little more than 5,000. The Indian subcontinent accounts for about 70%. Pushta Road explains why India has such a high number. The health centre serves a community of 42,000 people. Most live in temporary shacks along the nearby motorway and rail line. Open sewers run through the shanty settlements, a perfect conduit for polio. The disease is caused by a virus and spread through faeces-contaminated water. Polio can strike at any age but mainly affects children under three. It usually enters through the mouth and multiplies in the intestines. Once established, it can enter the bloodstream and invade the central nervous system, causing acute paralysis. The 'silent virus' Five decades ago in the western world, polio was a serious threat. It brought dread to communities, and swimming pools were closed to stop it spreading. In Britain, thousands were paralysed in the first two decades after the second world war. The only treatment was the \"iron lung\", a coffin-like metal cylinder that helped paralysed people to breathe. Not until the late 50s were the first effective vaccines introduced. Eradication in the west followed. The last British outbreak was 40 years ago. But in developing countries, where there were diseases with higher mortality rates, polio was not a priority. Even WHO was wary of eradication programmes. Until smallpox, there had been only failures; with malaria, hookworm, yellow fever. The 10-year smallpox offensive began in 1966 to combat up to 15m cases in 44 countries. This time, eradication was achieved - and only one year past the deadline. Polio shares some of the characteristics that allowed smallpox to be wiped out: a virus restricted to humans and not carried by animals or insects; lifelong immunity once a person is properly vaccinated; an effective vaccine. But there were differences that made polio a bigger challenge. Anyone could see the signs of smallpox on the skin; polio is known as the \"silent virus\". Only one in 200 people who have it may develop paralysis. No one knows why. With one particular strain, it is one in 1,000. Moreover, polio needs at least four doses of vaccine, preferably in the first year, and the vaccine requires refrigeration. But compared to smallpox, there is one advantage: the polio vaccine does not require an injection. The two drops can be delivered by non-medical people. No country has had a bigger challenge than India in such a health initiative. More than 25m babies are born every year. How do you immunise such huge numbers? It was the local Rotarians who helped persuade Indian officials to hold a national immunisation day. The officials were dubious. There are a billion people, three religions: Friday is a holy day for Muslims; Tuesday for Hindus; Sunday for Christians. Many villages lack electricity for refrigeration. In 1994 it was decided to try Delhi first. Sunday was chosen when the schools were empty and could be used as immunisation posts. The drive succeeded and officials were persuaded to go for a national day the next year. That succeeded too. The logistics are intimidating. The day begins at 9am and requires 650,000 immunisation posts. Some 2.6m people are involved in the organisation, only 200,000 of them health officials. By sunset on last month's national immunisation day, more than 134m children had been vaccinated. In urban areas, a polio army of secondary-school students helps get the children to the vaccination centres in schools, temples, churches, public squares. Mobilising the community begins weeks before the day, using radio, television, billboards, schools and pulpits. The national \"cold chain\" to keep the vaccine cool is equally daunting. Dairy companies and other firms with walk-in refrigerators are coopted. Mountains of ice are used in ice-packs and cool boxes. Transport ranges, according to WHO, from camel trains to helicopters. The aim of these national days is to create a wall of immunity that the virus cannot penetrate. The virus can multiply only in humans. With no one to infect, the virus dies. The dramatic drop in cases after national immunisation days on two consecutive months prompted India to try for four. In the words of one official, it was like organising four national elections, each needing at least a 90% turnout. Already 18 out of the 32 Indian states are polio-free. The two states with the most cases, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, are having six immunisation days. Yet national vaccine days are only one prong in the polio campaign. There is also routine immunisation at local health centres. Then come the supplementary doses after national immunisation days. And there is surveillance to pinpoint and isolate any new cases, and mopping up: house-to-house visits in affected areas to ensure every child is immunised. Posters on Afghan tanks Will WHO make it by the end of the year? Jon Andrus, who oversaw the final stages of polio eradication in the Americas, is impressed with India's speed in setting up its surveillance system. China took four years; India has done it in one. On the other hand, say deadline sceptics, Africa has 30% of the world's cases, but a number of its vaccination campaigns have been disrupted by wars. Bruce Aylward, global co-ordinator for WHO, was optimistic in Delhi this week. He pointed to three African states where ceasefires were negotiated in the past year to allow immunisation days. He has a picture of a Taliban tank in Afghanistan plastered with posters urging parents to have their children immunised. Dr Brundtland points to the progress so far. When the campaign began 12 years ago, 1,000 children a day were being paralysed by polio; today the number is down to 30. \"So long as a single child remains infected with polio\", she says, \"children everywhere are at risk.\" Other health battlefronts Eradication and control projects: \u0095 Guinea worm Expected to be the next disease wiped out. More than 20 countries where it used to be endemic - most of them in Africa - now certified as clear \u0095 Neonatal tetanus The third-highest killer of children among the six main diseases known to be preventable through vaccines. Killed 1m newborn babies a year in the early 80s, now cut by a fifth with 90% of cases centred in 25 countries. \u0095 Leprosy A new global programme aims to detect and cure 2.8m sufferers by 2005. \u0095 Elephantiasis (lymphatic filariasis) More than 120m are infected. A WHO project with the pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham and medical products firm Merck aims for elimination within 20 years. \u0095 River blindness (onchocerciasis) The drive against this disease started in west Africa in 1974, and has protected 36m against river blindness. The current goal is control. \u0095 Tuberculosis No vaccine, but a new campaign is reducing TB deaths fivefold where it is being adopted: 7m new cases a year; 1.5m deaths. \u0095 Malaria Up to 500m cases a year, the majority in Africa. More than 1m deaths. The new Roll Back Malaria campaign is focused on Africa. The leading infectious killers: Respiratory illnesses (including pneumonia,flu) 3.5m Aids 2.3m Diarrhoeal forms 2.2m Tuberculosis 1.5m Malarial forms lm Measles 0.9m",

Fearing a clash, the army last night deployed more than 1,000 soldiers and several armoured cars in the deserted, burnt-out streets that have become the city's no man's land.

      "bodyText": "The Tibetan youth was heavily muffled against the Himalayan cold - and to avoid discovery by Chinese police patrols. With a small group of four of five monks, also in disguise, he had travelled across the high plateau for nearly a week, on foot and by mule. The snow in the final pass was so deep that it buried the prayer flags and cairns of stones left by generations of pilgrims. A piercing wind swept down from Mount Everest as the party struggled on, down a perilous road threatened by ice-falls. From Tsurphu monastery, near Lhasa, to the border usually takes two days by land-cruiser. Urgyen Trinley Doje, the 17th Karmapa of the Kagyu sect, who is being groomed by China to be the Living Buddha, took nearly a week to reach Nepal and then Dharamsala, in the hills of northern India - the seat of the Tibetan government in exile. But the atrocious weather and the distraction of the new year must have helped the group circumvent Chinese checkpoints and find an unguarded route across the border. Yesterday Beijing was struggling in embarrassment to explain why the 17th Karmapa - the third most important figure in Tibetan Buddhist hierarchy - has joined the Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, in exile. A statement from the official Chinese news agency admitted that he had \"gone abroad\", without saying that he is now in Dharamsala. Traitor Even if 15-year-old Urgyen Trinley Dorje remains silent, keeping the door open for an eventual return home, it is a heavy blow for Beijing to see him in the camp of the spiritual leader it so bitterly denounced as a traitor. Beijing claimed yesterday that the Karmapa had left a letter saying he was just going to collect some musical instruments and sacred headgear used in his sect's ceremonies. It did not explain why the youth should have done so without first telling his Chinese minders - who were perhaps lulled by his previous good behaviour. Only last year the Chinese press poured praise on the young Karmapa. He was taken to Beijing to meet senior Communist party leaders, and was quoted as saying he would \"follow the teachings of President Jiang Zemin\" as well as those of Buddha. In accordance with Tibetan Buddhist practice, the 17th Karmapa had been identified was identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor when a child. A search team was sent out in 1992, armed with a prediction by the late 16th Karmapa and instructions from the Dalai Lama and found the boy. He had already been talent-spotted by a local abbot who was impressed by his fine white, clear features. When the party approached, the future 17th Karmapa is supposed to have cried out, \"my monks are coming. I'm going to my monastery!\" Though re-incarnation is hardly a socialist doctrine, Beijing made the shrewd tactical decision to approve the Dalai's choice, hoping to cultivate the young man as a religious counter-weight. Like the young Dalai Lama in the early 1950s, the Karmapa was taken to Beijing and coached in the wisdom of the Communist party. But his secret journey to India revives memories of the Dalai Lama's flight, after the March 1959 Tibetan uprising in Lhasa. Yesterday's Chinese statement said that the young Karmapa had left Tsurphu monastery \"with a small number of people around him.\" The wording may allow Beijing to argue later that the young man was led astray by his entourage - just it claimed the Dalai was in 1959. Beijing says that he left behind a letter saying that he did not mean to \"betray the state, the nation, the monastery or the [national] leadership.\" The admission that the journey could be seen as an act of \"betrayal\" shows China's anxiety. Karma Yeshi, vice-president of the militant Tibetan Youth Congress, said yesterday in Dharamsala. \"We welcomed him into India and paid homage to him. It is good news for all Tibetans, both in exile and still living in Tibet.\" The Tsurphu monastery has become a tourist attraction, with the support of the Chinese authorities. Supporters have funded its rebuilding after its destruction in the Cultural Revolution. Videotapes of the Karmapa and holy relics can be ordered from the movement's websites abroad. But in spite of Beijing's approval of the Karmapa, his monastery has suffered from increasingly crude efforts by local communist officials in Tibet to weed out potential dissent. Repression The young Karmapa complains that he was denied permission to visit his guru in exile, Tai Situ Rinpoche. This may have spurred him to leave. Re-education teams have made repeated visits to Tibetan monasteries giving compulsory lessons in \"patriotism\" under the slogan \"Love your country, love religion.\" Monks and nuns have been forced to repudiate the Dalai Lama, and some monasteries have been closed. In 1995 five monks at the Karmapa's monastery were said to have been arrested after throwing stones at government officials. Recent visitors to Tibet say that officials have become more heavy-handed since summer when Beijing launched its campaign against the Falun Gong sect - even though the Falun Gong has no appeal to Tibetan Buddhists. Leaders in faith and politics The system of reincarnation for Living Buddhas distinguishes Tibetan from other forms of Buddhism. Tibetans believe that the same individual is born again in successive generations: elaborate procedures have been devised for discovering the right child. There are more than 150 Living Buddhas alive today but until this week only the two most powerful - the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama - were involved in controversy. The young Karmapa, protege till now of Beijing, has now emerged dramatically. Dalai Lama Tibet's top spiritual leader is Living Buddha of the Yellow Sect. Worshipped by all Tibetans, he was also a symbol of political power.

The $1.5m was to set up an educational fund that would instruct all auditors in the virtues of total independence. </p> <p>Less publicised at the time was PwC's agreement to set up an internal review to check for other violations, and this week all PwC partners received an internal memo warning that the results \"will soon be published by the SEC and will reveal a large number of violations\". The number-crunchers should brace themselves, it said. </p> <p>How very true. The report discloses 8,064 breaches of the no-shares-in-clients rule by 1,885 PwC professionals over a two-year period, involving 2,159 client firms. </p> <p>The heavy-handed SEC has now requested PwC-style reviews of other big accounting firms in the US. </p> <p>The real danger now is not that the SEC's monkish-seeming rules will migrate to Europe but that the drive in Britain and elsewhere to end the concept of professional partnerships in favour of monster law-cum-accountancy corporations will tip the balance much too far the other way, and leave internal \"Chinese walls\" in the professions as ineffective as those that after 1986 supposedly kept broking, market-making and merchant banking on the straight and narrow. </p> <p>Fortunately, it seems our department of trade and industry is determined that will not happen. In April last year it confirmed that no audit client would be permitted to own a single share in any flotation of its auditors. Given the deep and liquid nature of City and Wall Street markets, this rule effectively scuppers any float. </p> <p>It must be hoped that for all professional services firms, whether lawyers such as Linklaters or accountants such as PwC, the new year message is clear: size is far from everything. </p> <p><strong> Wobbly words </strong><br> </p> <p> You could almost see the scenery shaking in the background during yesterday's episode of Media in the City. In fact, if you weren't concentrating, you might have mistaken it for a repeat showing of that Scottish Media Group/Talk Radio/Flextech soap - another cheap and cheerful production where Granada's Gerry Robinson and Charles Allen also jumped to their feet and started opinionising on a deal that wasn't theirs. </p> <p>The fact is that the British television industry long ago burst out of the delicately wrapped regulatory package created to hold it 10 years ago. Whatever the legislation says, all the main industry plays seem to assume that sooner or later Britain will end up with one powerful ITV broadcaster, a cable major and a satellite powerhouse. Until news of the planned merger of equal egos at United News &amp; Media and Carlton Communications emerged, Granada looked a shoo-in for the ITV bit of the new television picture. Now that its preeminent status is threatened, the company is fighting back, saying it is ready to bid for either United or Carlton if the authorities will let it. </p> <p>This is all simple enough stuff. Granada wants to be the biggest and the best in its bit of the business. It would be strange if Messrs Robinson and Allen were otherwise motivated. But, more to the immediate point, it is clear that Granada does not want to watch the rules surrounding television and media ownership in general reformed on some sort of creeping basis, where the odd problematic line is smudged here and there, while the overall regulatory structure remains as confusing as ever. </p> <p>That is a sensible enough wish. </p> <p><strong> Good terms </strong><br> </p> <p> Gordon Pell's appointment at NatWest was seen as a coup yesterday for Sir David Rowland in his newly expanded position as chairman and chief executive of the bank, although it might also have done his attackers a favour. Bank of Scotland was hinting yesterday that it might keep the man on board, if it wins. </p> <p>Whatever happens, BoS and rival predator Royal Bank of Scotland face increasingly hefty redundancy bills in the new-look NatWest boardroom. Mr Pell would cost \u00a31m to remove, while Ron Sandler, parachuted in as chief operating officer, is on a similar package. The terms of another recent recruit, Alistair Lyons, are unclear but can also be expected to be lucrative. These are the sort of short-term contracts that would make a millennium de-bugger blush.</p>",

Fortunately, it seems our department of trade and industry is determined that will not happen. In April last year it confirmed that no audit client would be permitted to own a single share in any flotation of its auditors. Given the deep and liquid nature of City and Wall Street markets, this rule effectively scuppers any float. It must be hoped that for all professional services firms, whether lawyers such as Linklaters or accountants such as PwC, the new year message is clear: size is far from everything. Wobbly words You could almost see the scenery shaking in the background during yesterday's episode of Media in the City. In fact, if you weren't concentrating, you might have mistaken it for a repeat showing of that Scottish Media Group/Talk Radio/Flextech soap - another cheap and cheerful production where Granada's Gerry Robinson and Charles Allen also jumped to their feet and started opinionising on a deal that wasn't theirs. The fact is that the British television industry long ago burst out of the delicately wrapped regulatory package created to hold it 10 years ago. Whatever the legislation says, all the main industry plays seem to assume that sooner or later Britain will end up with one powerful ITV broadcaster, a cable major and a satellite powerhouse. Until news of the planned merger of equal egos at United News &amp; Media and Carlton Communications emerged, Granada looked a shoo-in for the ITV bit of the new television picture. Now that its preeminent status is threatened, the company is fighting back, saying it is ready to bid for either United or Carlton if the authorities will let it. This is all simple enough stuff. Granada wants to be the biggest and the best in its bit of the business. It would be strange if Messrs Robinson and Allen were otherwise motivated. But, more to the immediate point, it is clear that Granada does not want to watch the rules surrounding television and media ownership in general reformed on some sort of creeping basis, where the odd problematic line is smudged here and there, while the overall regulatory structure remains as confusing as ever. That is a sensible enough wish. Good terms Gordon Pell's appointment at NatWest was seen as a coup yesterday for Sir David Rowland in his newly expanded position as chairman and chief executive of the bank, although it might also have done his attackers a favour. Bank of Scotland was hinting yesterday that it might keep the man on board, if it wins. Whatever happens, BoS and rival predator Royal Bank of Scotland face increasingly hefty redundancy bills in the new-look NatWest boardroom. Mr Pell would cost \u00a31m to remove, while Ron Sandler, parachuted in as chief operating officer, is on a similar package. The terms of another recent recruit, Alistair Lyons, are unclear but can also be expected to be lucrative. These are the sort of short-term contracts that would make a millennium de-bugger blush.",

      "body": "<p>When the imposing figure of Sir John Eliot Gardiner strode across the floor of Weimar's Herderkirche two days before Christmas to summon his beloved Monteverdi Choir and English Baroque Soloists to order, it was hard to avoid feeling that his life had reached its apogee. Virtually everything that constitutes his nature - his musical, historical, spiritual, even architectural passions - are expressible through the 200 Bach sacred cantatas, every one of which Gardiner will be performing through the year 2000 on the days for which they were written, at venues (usually churches) for which they seem fitted. </p> <p>It is an extraordinary pilgrimage, and in other musicians it might seem almost overweening; in Gardiner, though, this way of spending the first year of a new millennium seems almost a natural evolution. Which is not to say that it very nearly didn't happen: the whole project is going to cost around \u00a36m, flying musicians and singers all around Europe from Leipzig to Iona, and ultimately to America, giving a total of 60 concerts - the first in Britain will be at Greenwich a week tomorrow. And, despite having spent a large part of the last four years battling to raise the money, with the close support of his friend, Prince Charles, Gardiner still suspects that he will have to raise the last million on the run, between rehearsals. </p> <p>All of which makes you suspect that Gardiner has always wanted to embark on this campaign - particularly given that 2000 is also, felicitously, the 250th anniversary of Bach's death. Not so. In fact, the idea came quite serendipitously, while he was browsing through his own cv in a concert programme in 1996, in which, to his great surprise, he read that he was recording all of Bach's cantatas for Deutsche Grammophon. \"I thought, 'Oh really, am I? Well, I'm doing about one a year, so it'll be a long time before I've recorded the lot!' And then I started thinking, there are approximately three Jahrg\u00e4nge , complete cycles, with roughly three cantatas for each Sunday or religious festival, so you could perform concert-length programmes for each one.\" </p> <p>Gardiner recognises that the programme note sparked an \"inner need\" - his urge to perform ancient music in a context which brings it alive. Though he carries a reputation for almost inhuman fervour, it is the intense delight in the humanity of ancient music - its dancing rhythms and earthiness - that most distinguishes his performances, and makes him one of Britain's most-purchased conductors on CD. </p> <p>Gardiner's self-willed, impassioned intensity, and the universal reputation for abrasive arrogance that goes with it, run deep into his youth - indeed, they run in his blood. His grandfather, Sir Alan Gardiner, was an eminent Egyptologist who cracked the code which enabled entry to Tutankhamun's tomb. Alan's brother, Balfour, was a bachelor composer, part of the group which studied in Frankfurt in the 1880s along with Percy Grainger. Regarded as the most gifted orchestrator of his period, Balfour (who had private means from his merchant father) often spent more money and energy staging other composers' new work than his own; he paid, for example, for the first public rehearsal of Holst's Planets in 1918, supported Vaughan Williams, and was Delius' executor. </p> <p>But in the 1920s, Balfour became disillusioned with his own music, burnt most of his manuscripts, and decamped instead to a derelict stretch of the 300m escarpment that looks steeply down on the vale south of Shaftesbury on the Dorset-Wiltshire border. There he summoned Rolf, his nephew and John Eliot's soon-to-be father, to set up home in Gore Farm, an old house he'd bought on the top of the windswept hill for \u00a3150. Both men became prominent pioneers in the nascent organic farming movement, and set about attempting to recreate the ancient Cranborne Chase forest that once covered their 1,500 acres: they planted roughly four million trees, and ran the farm as near to self-sufficiency as they could man age. They even took their straw to the nearby army camp at Blandford, filled the barracks's septic tanks with it, and then brought back the soldier's sewage to fertilise their chalk fields. </p> <p>When John Eliot describes his father as \"off the wall\" it's important to understand that that's a compliment in the Gardiner lexicon. To him it means eccentrically alternative, sure, but it also means individualist, adventurous, original, as opposed to downright bonkers. Along with John Eliot's mother, Marabel, Rolf, a founder member of the Soil Association and revivalist Morris dancer, set about converting their home into a kind of ersatz rural university. </p> <p>Marabel was, if anything, even more eccentric than her husband. Born into one of the Quaker families related to the Frys and Cadburys (Gardiner's first cousin on her side is Howard Hodgkin, the painter) she hired au pairs to cook and converse in German and French with her children, while she taught them singing, dancing, handicrafts, and everything academic. The couple, influenced heavily by the writings of Rudolf Steiner and DH Lawrence, invited people to work at the farm over weekends or during their summer holidays, and join in their music-making, mime, dance and drama. </p> <p> Unsurprisingly the local squirearchy regarded the Gardiner clan as a cluster of nutters, but for John Eliot it was a blissfully exciting normality. Gore Farm, now Gardiner's home, overlooks a long paddock where unemployed miners from Durham and Cleveland would spend the summer in tents, working for two or three hours a day in the woods, planting trees, and then putting on \"these amazing improvised mimes, where they'd take an ancient Greek myth, or Nordic saga, and dramatise it\". The family moved down the valley to Springhead, a larger house at the far end of the farm. Gardiner is aware that his childhood was faintly bizarre, but he recalls it with beguiling fondness. The family's life was an exotic blend of lofty hausmusik culture infused with a slightly whacky, open-sandalled, barn-dancing, artsy-craftsiness. </p> <p>Gardiner produced a surprisingly successful CD last Christmas putting together all the music he remembered from the Nativity shows, in which he first appeared at the age of two as a \"somewhat grumpy-looking angel\". As his parents extended their range, pieces were commissioned from contemporary composers, and the group performed everything from Gregorian chant through Palestrina, Schutz, Monteverdi, Bach. </p> <p>This was the environment in which Gardiner acquired a powerful sense of the turning seasons. \"At Whitsun for example, we had a weekend of choral singing and dancing - maybe 12 or 15 people would be staying - Imogen Holst came to conduct, John Gardner, the composer, expounded Palestrina to us all, we'd sing ballads in the evening, folk songs, then bless the springs at the end of Springhead garden. Usually there'd be a priest as well. </p> <p>\"I was allowed to sing Bach's motets, which I learnt by heart at the age of six or seven, conducted by Sir Thomas Armstrong from the Royal Academy. I don't know whether it was a good grounding, but it was certainly an original grounding.\" </p> <p>No wonder Bach's cycles of cantatas have such an insistent pull on the conductor's adult imagination nor that he should so want to perform them in place, rather than in the comparatively sterile atmosphere of a modern concert hall. </p> <p>Gardiner's friends say his mother was an immensely powerful, adoring influence, inflating her son's sense of self-belief with a conviction that he would go on to great things. \"It was a kind of spoiling, making him think that he was very special, which of course he was, and proved to be. Not the best thing, though, for the development of his personality,\" says one musician who has known Gardiner since his early years. </p> <p>Marabel taught her children individually, so that when Gardiner was finally sent \"kicking and screaming to prep school\" at the age of seven, he was already precociously ahead of his contemporaries, and couldn't understand why they couldn't write Latin, or speak French, German and Italian, as he could. She even took each child to Italy with her alone for a weeks' holiday, educating them in situ about Renaissance art, architecture, and music - a journey Gardiner loved so much, being luxuriously alone for a whole week with his mother, that he has repeated it with each of his own three girls when they turned 12. </p> <p>And how did he like Pinewood Preparatory? \"Horrible, vile, pederastic, corporal punishment, snobby, militaristic. I hated it.\" He spent as much of his term-time as possible in the art room, and yearned to be back on the farm, heading out early with the cowman, or cutting kale. His elder brother went to Eton and Gardiner was marked down for Winchester, but the family eventually sent him to Bryanston, a school then influenced, like Gordonstoun, by the teaching methods of Kurt Hahn - self-reliant, out-of-doorsy, with a high creative content. </p> <p>Just before he left for senior school Gardiner fell off the roof of the Springhead house and smashed the bones in both feet, hospitalising him for six weeks, and wiping out his first term. He clearly thinks those weeks were a crucial turning point in his life - as early teenage illnesses often are. He recalls lying in bed thinking about what he was going to do, and therefore arrived at school a term late, with a steely determination to apply himself. </p> <p>The pianist David Ward, who encouraged Gardiner to sing tenor at Bryanston, says: \"It's hard to explain how, but he did stand apart in some way, partly because he arrived late, partly because he came from the big country house. He seemed to be on the defensive quite a lot.\" Professor John Smyth, a cancer research doctor who still sings for the Monteverdi, also knew Gardiner at Bryanston: \"You certainly wouldn't have said he was the school music hero - it was a very musical place at the time, and there were many others who were thought to outshine him.\" </p> <p>Gardiner had no idea that he would make music his career. In fact he was more bitten by history, and had half a mind to return to the farm. He won a history scholarship to King's College, Cambridge, but took a year off first to travel in the Middle East. </p> <p>He spent the summer in Lebanon and Jordan, and, through a godfather who taught at the American University in Beirut, wangled a job on a dig at Petra, moved on to work in a Bethlehem refugee camp, and ended up helping to write a film script for a UN documentary about refugees in Beirut, visiting Jericho and Gaza by UN helicopter. He came back with a strong interest in the Arab world, the way astronomy, music, mathematics had come to Europe via the Arabs, through Spain. </p> <p>Gardiner knew he was going to be someone, but after a couple of years at Cambridge he still wasn't sure in what field. Arabist history don? Musician? He went to see Edmund Leach, his tutor and provost. \"He said, 'what do you really want to do?' and I found myself thinking, 'I'd really like to conduct the Monteverdi Vespers, it's never been done in Cambridge', and he said, 'Fine, take a year off - but you'll have to read something'.\" So in his third year Gardiner learnt classical Arabic and Spanish and set about planning his great concert, the event that transformed his life. </p> <p>There he was in 1964, 20 years old, multi-talented, topped up by his mother with a sense that he already had a place booked among life's achievers. Though he loved singing, he never deigned to join the famous King's College Choir, because he couldn't bear their creamy, bland sound. Instead he recruited his own crew of singers, and taught them to sing as they never had before: \"We wanted to get a multi-coloured, almost operatic sound, like the paintings of Monteverdi's time, we wanted the musical equivalent of that.\" </p> <p>He is touchingly wry about his young, single-minded self: \"I had all the passion and complete disregard of youth, I guess. There I was, up against David Willcocks, who ran the King's choir then, throwing down a gauntlet to him, in a way, saying there's a different way of making music, and that was a terribly arrogant thing to do, but I felt passionately that it needed to be done. It was a mixture of idealism, and, yes, arrogance.\" </p> <p>He organised the entire event, from putting up the chairs to booking soloists to rehearsing the Ely boys choir - \"the Cambridge boys' choirs were too snotty to want to be involved\". And, unusually for the time, he decided to use period instruments, proper cornets and sackbuts. The show was a barnstorming success. With typical determination, Gardiner ensured that the London broadsheet critics all came up, and they heaped praise. His future was fixed. As soon as he'd completed his degree he headed to London, where he kept the choir going. Suzanne Flowers, the longest remaining member of the Monteverdi Choir, says that their young group soon understood the character with whom they had signed up: \"We first sang together in a small quartet, I remember, with John Eliot singing tenor, and we started to prepare, and it was soon apparent that there wasn't any point in contesting whatever he said, or wanted. We just said, 'leave that to John Eliot'.\" </p> <p>Naturally dominant? Or brutally domineering? Plenty of musicians who have suffered Gardiner's caustic tongue would accuse him, as a young man, of having been needlessly, nastily sharp with musicians he felt were not up to his standards, or weren't pulling their weight. John Smyth says Gardiner was always \"relentlessly demanding\", but in pursuit of musical excellence, not his own self-aggrandisement: \"One of the great challenges of his life is that he doesn't suffer fools gladly at all, and he sets himself standards that are absolutely in the stratosphere. He's the most talented musician I've ever met, but it did come at a price for his personal reputation.\" </p> <p>On occasion Gardiner has had music stands thrown at him for his cutting remarks in rehearsal. But, says Smyth, \"those same musicians, who would sit around demanding to know who the hell John Eliot thinks he is, would go out that night and play better than they ever had before\". Member after member of his choirs and orchestras testifies to the intensity of his commitment, and the excitement of performing with him. Flowers, who is keen to emphasise that her relationship with Gardiner is purely professional, says that working on a piece with him \"is like sex for the spirit - he just takes it onto another plane\". Gardiner famously failed to land the job as musical director of Opera North because the musicians refused point blank to work with him. And many of his friends speculate that Jeggy (as they all call him, though not to his face) is at root a somewhat lonely character. </p> <p>At 22 he was embarking on a conducting career with virtually no formal training. When he went to study under Nadia Boulanger in Paris she was confronted with a precocious young man who had never learnt the kind of basic harmony that most musicians would have completed in their early teens. Gardiner recalls, \"Nadia told me that I was doing at 24 what she had done when she was six. 'Your 'armony,' she used to say, 'iz a tragedy wizout name'!\" </p> <p>Throughout his studies in Paris Gardiner kept the choir going, returning to London to do radio broadcasts, madrigals in the V&amp;A, performing baroque material that most audiences had barely heard before. He was deeply conscious of being in the vanguard of a revolution, but insists that he and his singers never felt like Trots: \"There wasn't that hair-shirt approach in the early days - that illness of self-denying puritanical minimalism that beset the early music revival in the 1980s.\" </p> <p>Edward Greenfield, the Guardian's long-standing music critic, who reviewed that first Monteverdi performance, confirms that Gardiner was always less extreme than many of the other pioneering early music practitioners. But, he adds: \"He is the leader of it all. And yes, he's arrogant - but he's got something to be arrogant about.\" </p> <p>Gardiner was not interested in doing Bach's B minor mass with only one voice to a part but he was very conscious of wanting to break new soil, \"to make the singing extrovert, extravagant, passionately delivered, not done in that prissy English way\". He admits, though, that \"I got a bloody nose in the process\". Because he had felt unhappy performing with technically insecure exponents of period instruments, he was slower than some others in switching from playing modern instruments in an idiomatic way to \"going the whole hog\". </p> <p>Hildburg Williams, a German violinist was among those who made the leap with Gardiner in 1977. Gardiner had realised, after a particular performance of Rameau that year, that he simply couldn't get the colour he wanted from modern instruments. So for a short time the orchestra used baroque bows on modern instruments. \"We all struggled a bit,\" she says, \"and John Eliot soon realised that this halfway approach was unsatisfactory.\" So, the following year, Gardiner switched to period instruments. Several regular players refused to follow him, and the split effectively led to the creation of the English Baroque Soloists, Gardiner's instrumentalists ever since. Williams, though, remembers it as the most exciting time of her career: \"The instruments and bows dictated a complete rethink of playing technique. It became possible to achieve absolute clarity in texture, to articulate, to speak with the instrument.\" Gardiner, as much a musicologist as a musician, often rehearsed pieces with the original manuscript or a facsimile as his guide. </p> <p>Sir Georg Solti expressed some of the reservations about the early music movement when he said: \"How many instruments do we have left from Mozart's time? Not one. Why should I conduct badly tuned instruments that were made yesterday when I can have perfect modern ones?\" </p> <p>Critic Norman Lebrecht has said that, led by Gardiner, the early music movement has won an elective majority in the market place. \"The cult has claimed the centreground, homeopathy has defeated the BMA.\" </p> <p>Gardiner says it took four or five years to get it right. \"Also, I wasn't accepted by the early music people to start with. They didn't approve of having a conductor at all, especially one who had very strong ideas, a stickler for discipline, wanting to get things in tune, rhythmically correct. And I think they were a bit resentful of the glamour and success of the choir, which was more manifest than that of the orchestra.\" </p> <p> His private and emotional life has been an equally stormy passage. His first marriage, to Cheryl, wound up when they were still both young and childless. The eventual failure of his much longer second marriage, to Elizabeth Wilcock, was a sadder affair. While Gardiner was intent on an exhaustive schedule that had him ricocheting around the world's concert halls and recording studies, Elizabeth (who had been a member of the choir) increasingly wanted to stay at home tending their three daughters. Touring conductors are never short of temptations, and it would have been surprising if Gardiner, given his huge emotional energy, had not succumbed. </p> <p>Gradually the couple drifted apart, and he now lives with Isabella de Sabata, a young Italian he met when she was helping as a publicist in Germany. Now they tour together, with Isabella acting as an occasional secretary, manager and agent: in between concerts they return to the peace of Gore Farm, where Gardiner enjoys the company of his daughters as much as he can. </p> <p>His brother inherited most of the land, farmed it for a while, but then sold up (provoking considerable family acrimony - something that seems almost traditional among Gardiner siblings). John Eliot inherited Gore Farm, and his sister moved into Springhead. Distressed by the loss of the farm, Gardiner set about trying to buy back as much as he could. As you walk around the 500 acres he has now accumulated, he points out barns and cattle sheds, explaining how that one was paid for by a stint at the Wiener Staatsoper, and that other one by a big American series. His handsome conducting income is, in large measure, ploughed back into Gore - a kind of recycling that his long-dead great uncle would no doubt have applauded. </p> <p>At one remove, it's easy to imagine that farming is just a quirky Gardiner hobby, a way of relaxing from the pressures of the music circuit. But he's no part-time agri-gent. When you see the man in his quilted jacket and muck-spattered boots slapping steers into weighing pens, trading plans with his stockman, and tramping over the fields to deliver his field hand's latest instructions, it's actually much harder to think of him as one of the world's most eminent, perfectionist conductors. \"The locals regard him as a farmer, who happens to do music as a bit of a sideline,\" says Suzanne Flowers. </p> <p>In fact, though, the farmer is intimately interwoven with the conductor. Perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of his music-making is its on-the-earth aliveness - you might almost say its organic quality. The cantata pilgrimage is like coming home for Gardiner. In recent years he has moved on from early music, recording Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann - and continuing to stack up recording awards like an Olympic athlete's trophies: the list of Grand Prix du Disque and Grammys runs on interminably. </p> <p>And yet, he has never run a major orchestra. He has guested with most, spent seasons with some of the greatest, led countless music festivals, and performed with most of the world's most outstanding soloists. Some musicians feel that this refusal to sign up with one of the great orchestras diminishes his status - but he is unrepentant, preferring to make music with the bands (including, more recently, the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique) that he has created himself. </p> <p>David Ward says: \"It's not only that he likes to do his own thing, although that's a large factor. It's also that the choir and orchestra he's created are like his family, and he is their patriarch: he's happier with them than with strangers.\" </p> <p>Even while spreading his repertoire wings, Eliot has remained content to treat music-making as a more or less peripatetic way of life, moving restlessly on from one event to the next, laying down a staggering career average of some six discs a year, many of them regarded as being among the outstanding contemporary recordings of the work, almost none of them duff (Edward Greenfield can only think of one, off the top of his head: a Schubert Unfinished Symphony for Erato which Gardiner inevitably reploughed for DG a little while later).The sheer energy, let alone quality, is enough to make his competitors wilt. </p> <p>But Bach is, for him, about as special as music gets. \"I believe that Schumann had it right when he said that the ultimate form of music-making in the west is when you bring choir and orchestra together, when you have the symbiosis of instrument and voice. And who does that better than Bach?\" Of course that union is most masterful in the B minor Mass, or the St Matthew Passion - but Gardiner says that, as he has worked through the 200 cantatas, many of which he'd never encountered before, he has been staggered not to find a single poor one among them. </p> <p>\"What I find fascinating about them is this constant variation on two planes at once: you hear them horizontally, as a haunting and beautiful melody, or as counterpoint or polyphony, all against the fundament of the basso continuo; and at the same time you hear them vertically, with all Bach's rhythmical bounce, his upward aspiration.\" </p> <p>Mostly, the texts for Bach's cantatas are not directly biblical, but drawn from a particularly esoteric strand of early 18th century Lutheran commentaries - so Gardiner does see a need to \"de-Germanise\" them. The musicologist in him connects Bach through Buxtehude and Schutz to Monteverdi and St Mark's, Venice, pointing out that Bach's multicoloured, spirited quality probably came from contemporary Italy. \"The way I approach Bach is ungermanic. I'm looking for the rhythmic zest. I believe passionately that you worship the gods in the Old Testament way, by dancing - and that of course comes from my upbringing. The aspiration [in Bach] comes from the voices, and above all the trumpets. Whenever Bach gets a trumpet out the heavens open for me.\" </p> <p>Curious, that this charismatically extroverted performer should be so moved, musically, by works that are at heart arcane, esoteric, in their source. And yet... after the bluster, and showmanship, all Jeggy's friends agree that the most discreet side of his personality is his faith. David Ward says: \"I'm sure this pilgrimage is, in a way, a means of proclaiming his faith.\" </p> <p>John Eliot Gardiner is certainly not among the most loved conductors: controversy and contumely attach to his reputation in equal measure. But he has inevitably mellowed, and bears the wounds of a turbulent personal life and professional career with reserved dignity. He is a grippingly interesting and often charming companion, more musicologically knowledgeable than most of his conducting peers. Bach's cantatas, whose eloquence principally celebrates man's ability, though flawed, to compass the heavens, seem an apt way for him to spend the 2000th year since the birth of Christ. </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance: Sir John Eliot Gardiner </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> April 20 1943. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Pinewood Preparatory School; Bryanston School; King's College, Cambridge (MA history); King's College London; with Nadia Boulanger, Paris 1966-68. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> 1981<strong> </strong> Elizabeth Wilcock (three daughters), marriage dissolved, 1997. </p> <p><strong> Career: </strong> Founder<strong> </strong> Monteverdi Choir, 1964; Monteverdi Orchestra, 1968; English Baroque Soloists, 1978; Orchestre R\u00e9volutionnaire et Romantique, 1990.

      "bodyText": "When the imposing figure of Sir John Eliot Gardiner strode across the floor of Weimar's Herderkirche two days before Christmas to summon his beloved Monteverdi Choir and English Baroque Soloists to order, it was hard to avoid feeling that his life had reached its apogee. Virtually everything that constitutes his nature - his musical, historical, spiritual, even architectural passions - are expressible through the 200 Bach sacred cantatas, every one of which Gardiner will be performing through the year 2000 on the days for which they were written, at venues (usually churches) for which they seem fitted. It is an extraordinary pilgrimage, and in other musicians it might seem almost overweening; in Gardiner, though, this way of spending the first year of a new millennium seems almost a natural evolution. Which is not to say that it very nearly didn't happen: the whole project is going to cost around \u00a36m, flying musicians and singers all around Europe from Leipzig to Iona, and ultimately to America, giving a total of 60 concerts - the first in Britain will be at Greenwich a week tomorrow. And, despite having spent a large part of the last four years battling to raise the money, with the close support of his friend, Prince Charles, Gardiner still suspects that he will have to raise the last million on the run, between rehearsals. All of which makes you suspect that Gardiner has always wanted to embark on this campaign - particularly given that 2000 is also, felicitously, the 250th anniversary of Bach's death. Not so. In fact, the idea came quite serendipitously, while he was browsing through his own cv in a concert programme in 1996, in which, to his great surprise, he read that he was recording all of Bach's cantatas for Deutsche Grammophon. \"I thought, 'Oh really, am I? Well, I'm doing about one a year, so it'll be a long time before I've recorded the lot!' And then I started thinking, there are approximately three Jahrg\u00e4nge , complete cycles, with roughly three cantatas for each Sunday or religious festival, so you could perform concert-length programmes for each one.\" Gardiner recognises that the programme note sparked an \"inner need\" - his urge to perform ancient music in a context which brings it alive. Though he carries a reputation for almost inhuman fervour, it is the intense delight in the humanity of ancient music - its dancing rhythms and earthiness - that most distinguishes his performances, and makes him one of Britain's most-purchased conductors on CD. Gardiner's self-willed, impassioned intensity, and the universal reputation for abrasive arrogance that goes with it, run deep into his youth - indeed, they run in his blood. His grandfather, Sir Alan Gardiner, was an eminent Egyptologist who cracked the code which enabled entry to Tutankhamun's tomb. Alan's brother, Balfour, was a bachelor composer, part of the group which studied in Frankfurt in the 1880s along with Percy Grainger. Regarded as the most gifted orchestrator of his period, Balfour (who had private means from his merchant father) often spent more money and energy staging other composers' new work than his own; he paid, for example, for the first public rehearsal of Holst's Planets in 1918, supported Vaughan Williams, and was Delius' executor. But in the 1920s, Balfour became disillusioned with his own music, burnt most of his manuscripts, and decamped instead to a derelict stretch of the 300m escarpment that looks steeply down on the vale south of Shaftesbury on the Dorset-Wiltshire border. There he summoned Rolf, his nephew and John Eliot's soon-to-be father, to set up home in Gore Farm, an old house he'd bought on the top of the windswept hill for \u00a3150. Both men became prominent pioneers in the nascent organic farming movement, and set about attempting to recreate the ancient Cranborne Chase forest that once covered their 1,500 acres: they planted roughly four million trees, and ran the farm as near to self-sufficiency as they could man age. They even took their straw to the nearby army camp at Blandford, filled the barracks's septic tanks with it, and then brought back the soldier's sewage to fertilise their chalk fields. When John Eliot describes his father as \"off the wall\" it's important to understand that that's a compliment in the Gardiner lexicon. To him it means eccentrically alternative, sure, but it also means individualist, adventurous, original, as opposed to downright bonkers. Along with John Eliot's mother, Marabel, Rolf, a founder member of the Soil Association and revivalist Morris dancer, set about converting their home into a kind of ersatz rural university. Marabel was, if anything, even more eccentric than her husband. Born into one of the Quaker families related to the Frys and Cadburys (Gardiner's first cousin on her side is Howard Hodgkin, the painter) she hired au pairs to cook and converse in German and French with her children, while she taught them singing, dancing, handicrafts, and everything academic. The couple, influenced heavily by the writings of Rudolf Steiner and DH Lawrence, invited people to work at the farm over weekends or during their summer holidays, and join in their music-making, mime, dance and drama. Unsurprisingly the local squirearchy regarded the Gardiner clan as a cluster of nutters, but for John Eliot it was a blissfully exciting normality. Gore Farm, now Gardiner's home, overlooks a long paddock where unemployed miners from Durham and Cleveland would spend the summer in tents, working for two or three hours a day in the woods, planting trees, and then putting on \"these amazing improvised mimes, where they'd take an ancient Greek myth, or Nordic saga, and dramatise it\". The family moved down the valley to Springhead, a larger house at the far end of the farm. Gardiner is aware that his childhood was faintly bizarre, but he recalls it with beguiling fondness. The family's life was an exotic blend of lofty hausmusik culture infused with a slightly whacky, open-sandalled, barn-dancing, artsy-craftsiness. Gardiner produced a surprisingly successful CD last Christmas putting together all the music he remembered from the Nativity shows, in which he first appeared at the age of two as a \"somewhat grumpy-looking angel\". As his parents extended their range, pieces were commissioned from contemporary composers, and the group performed everything from Gregorian chant through Palestrina, Schutz, Monteverdi, Bach. This was the environment in which Gardiner acquired a powerful sense of the turning seasons. \"At Whitsun for example, we had a weekend of choral singing and dancing - maybe 12 or 15 people would be staying - Imogen Holst came to conduct, John Gardner, the composer, expounded Palestrina to us all, we'd sing ballads in the evening, folk songs, then bless the springs at the end of Springhead garden. Usually there'd be a priest as well. \"I was allowed to sing Bach's motets, which I learnt by heart at the age of six or seven, conducted by Sir Thomas Armstrong from the Royal Academy. I don't know whether it was a good grounding, but it was certainly an original grounding.\" No wonder Bach's cycles of cantatas have such an insistent pull on the conductor's adult imagination nor that he should so want to perform them in place, rather than in the comparatively sterile atmosphere of a modern concert hall. Gardiner's friends say his mother was an immensely powerful, adoring influence, inflating her son's sense of self-belief with a conviction that he would go on to great things. \"It was a kind of spoiling, making him think that he was very special, which of course he was, and proved to be. Not the best thing, though, for the development of his personality,\" says one musician who has known Gardiner since his early years. Marabel taught her children individually, so that when Gardiner was finally sent \"kicking and screaming to prep school\" at the age of seven, he was already precociously ahead of his contemporaries, and couldn't understand why they couldn't write Latin, or speak French, German and Italian, as he could. She even took each child to Italy with her alone for a weeks' holiday, educating them in situ about Renaissance art, architecture, and music - a journey Gardiner loved so much, being luxuriously alone for a whole week with his mother, that he has repeated it with each of his own three girls when they turned 12. And how did he like Pinewood Preparatory? \"Horrible, vile, pederastic, corporal punishment, snobby, militaristic. I hated it.\" He spent as much of his term-time as possible in the art room, and yearned to be back on the farm, heading out early with the cowman, or cutting kale. His elder brother went to Eton and Gardiner was marked down for Winchester, but the family eventually sent him to Bryanston, a school then influenced, like Gordonstoun, by the teaching methods of Kurt Hahn - self-reliant, out-of-doorsy, with a high creative content. Just before he left for senior school Gardiner fell off the roof of the Springhead house and smashed the bones in both feet, hospitalising him for six weeks, and wiping out his first term. He clearly thinks those weeks were a crucial turning point in his life - as early teenage illnesses often are. He recalls lying in bed thinking about what he was going to do, and therefore arrived at school a term late, with a steely determination to apply himself. The pianist David Ward, who encouraged Gardiner to sing tenor at Bryanston, says: \"It's hard to explain how, but he did stand apart in some way, partly because he arrived late, partly because he came from the big country house. He seemed to be on the defensive quite a lot.\" Professor John Smyth, a cancer research doctor who still sings for the Monteverdi, also knew Gardiner at Bryanston: \"You certainly wouldn't have said he was the school music hero - it was a very musical place at the time, and there were many others who were thought to outshine him.\" Gardiner had no idea that he would make music his career. In fact he was more bitten by history, and had half a mind to return to the farm. He won a history scholarship to King's College, Cambridge, but took a year off first to travel in the Middle East. He spent the summer in Lebanon and Jordan, and, through a godfather who taught at the American University in Beirut, wangled a job on a dig at Petra, moved on to work in a Bethlehem refugee camp, and ended up helping to write a film script for a UN documentary about refugees in Beirut, visiting Jericho and Gaza by UN helicopter. He came back with a strong interest in the Arab world, the way astronomy, music, mathematics had come to Europe via the Arabs, through Spain. Gardiner knew he was going to be someone, but after a couple of years at Cambridge he still wasn't sure in what field. Arabist history don? Musician? He went to see Edmund Leach, his tutor and provost. \"He said, 'what do you really want to do?' and I found myself thinking, 'I'd really like to conduct the Monteverdi Vespers, it's never been done in Cambridge', and he said, 'Fine, take a year off - but you'll have to read something'.\" So in his third year Gardiner learnt classical Arabic and Spanish and set about planning his great concert, the event that transformed his life. There he was in 1964, 20 years old, multi-talented, topped up by his mother with a sense that he already had a place booked among life's achievers. Though he loved singing, he never deigned to join the famous King's College Choir, because he couldn't bear their creamy, bland sound. Instead he recruited his own crew of singers, and taught them to sing as they never had before: \"We wanted to get a multi-coloured, almost operatic sound, like the paintings of Monteverdi's time, we wanted the musical equivalent of that.\" He is touchingly wry about his young, single-minded self: \"I had all the passion and complete disregard of youth, I guess. There I was, up against David Willcocks, who ran the King's choir then, throwing down a gauntlet to him, in a way, saying there's a different way of making music, and that was a terribly arrogant thing to do, but I felt passionately that it needed to be done. It was a mixture of idealism, and, yes, arrogance.\" He organised the entire event, from putting up the chairs to booking soloists to rehearsing the Ely boys choir - \"the Cambridge boys' choirs were too snotty to want to be involved\". And, unusually for the time, he decided to use period instruments, proper cornets and sackbuts. The show was a barnstorming success. With typical determination, Gardiner ensured that the London broadsheet critics all came up, and they heaped praise. His future was fixed. As soon as he'd completed his degree he headed to London, where he kept the choir going. Suzanne Flowers, the longest remaining member of the Monteverdi Choir, says that their young group soon understood the character with whom they had signed up: \"We first sang together in a small quartet, I remember, with John Eliot singing tenor, and we started to prepare, and it was soon apparent that there wasn't any point in contesting whatever he said, or wanted. We just said, 'leave that to John Eliot'.\" Naturally dominant? Or brutally domineering? Plenty of musicians who have suffered Gardiner's caustic tongue would accuse him, as a young man, of having been needlessly, nastily sharp with musicians he felt were not up to his standards, or weren't pulling their weight. John Smyth says Gardiner was always \"relentlessly demanding\", but in pursuit of musical excellence, not his own self-aggrandisement: \"One of the great challenges of his life is that he doesn't suffer fools gladly at all, and he sets himself standards that are absolutely in the stratosphere. He's the most talented musician I've ever met, but it did come at a price for his personal reputation.\" On occasion Gardiner has had music stands thrown at him for his cutting remarks in rehearsal. But, says Smyth, \"those same musicians, who would sit around demanding to know who the hell John Eliot thinks he is, would go out that night and play better than they ever had before\". Member after member of his choirs and orchestras testifies to the intensity of his commitment, and the excitement of performing with him. Flowers, who is keen to emphasise that her relationship with Gardiner is purely professional, says that working on a piece with him \"is like sex for the spirit - he just takes it onto another plane\". Gardiner famously failed to land the job as musical director of Opera North because the musicians refused point blank to work with him. And many of his friends speculate that Jeggy (as they all call him, though not to his face) is at root a somewhat lonely character. At 22 he was embarking on a conducting career with virtually no formal training. When he went to study under Nadia Boulanger in Paris she was confronted with a precocious young man who had never learnt the kind of basic harmony that most musicians would have completed in their early teens. Gardiner recalls, \"Nadia told me that I was doing at 24 what she had done when she was six. 'Your 'armony,' she used to say, 'iz a tragedy wizout name'!\" Throughout his studies in Paris Gardiner kept the choir going, returning to London to do radio broadcasts, madrigals in the V&amp;A, performing baroque material that most audiences had barely heard before. He was deeply conscious of being in the vanguard of a revolution, but insists that he and his singers never felt like Trots: \"There wasn't that hair-shirt approach in the early days - that illness of self-denying puritanical minimalism that beset the early music revival in the 1980s.\" Edward Greenfield, the Guardian's long-standing music critic, who reviewed that first Monteverdi performance, confirms that Gardiner was always less extreme than many of the other pioneering early music practitioners. But, he adds: \"He is the leader of it all. And yes, he's arrogant - but he's got something to be arrogant about.\" Gardiner was not interested in doing Bach's B minor mass with only one voice to a part but he was very conscious of wanting to break new soil, \"to make the singing extrovert, extravagant, passionately delivered, not done in that prissy English way\". He admits, though, that \"I got a bloody nose in the process\". Because he had felt unhappy performing with technically insecure exponents of period instruments, he was slower than some others in switching from playing modern instruments in an idiomatic way to \"going the whole hog\". Hildburg Williams, a German violinist was among those who made the leap with Gardiner in 1977. Gardiner had realised, after a particular performance of Rameau that year, that he simply couldn't get the colour he wanted from modern instruments. So for a short time the orchestra used baroque bows on modern instruments. \"We all struggled a bit,\" she says, \"and John Eliot soon realised that this halfway approach was unsatisfactory.\" So, the following year, Gardiner switched to period instruments. Several regular players refused to follow him, and the split effectively led to the creation of the English Baroque Soloists, Gardiner's instrumentalists ever since. Williams, though, remembers it as the most exciting time of her career: \"The instruments and bows dictated a complete rethink of playing technique. It became possible to achieve absolute clarity in texture, to articulate, to speak with the instrument.\" Gardiner, as much a musicologist as a musician, often rehearsed pieces with the original manuscript or a facsimile as his guide. Sir Georg Solti expressed some of the reservations about the early music movement when he said: \"How many instruments do we have left from Mozart's time? Not one. Why should I conduct badly tuned instruments that were made yesterday when I can have perfect modern ones?\" Critic Norman Lebrecht has said that, led by Gardiner, the early music movement has won an elective majority in the market place. \"The cult has claimed the centreground, homeopathy has defeated the BMA.\" Gardiner says it took four or five years to get it right. \"Also, I wasn't accepted by the early music people to start with. They didn't approve of having a conductor at all, especially one who had very strong ideas, a stickler for discipline, wanting to get things in tune, rhythmically correct. And I think they were a bit resentful of the glamour and success of the choir, which was more manifest than that of the orchestra.\" His private and emotional life has been an equally stormy passage. His first marriage, to Cheryl, wound up when they were still both young and childless. The eventual failure of his much longer second marriage, to Elizabeth Wilcock, was a sadder affair. While Gardiner was intent on an exhaustive schedule that had him ricocheting around the world's concert halls and recording studies, Elizabeth (who had been a member of the choir) increasingly wanted to stay at home tending their three daughters. Touring conductors are never short of temptations, and it would have been surprising if Gardiner, given his huge emotional energy, had not succumbed. Gradually the couple drifted apart, and he now lives with Isabella de Sabata, a young Italian he met when she was helping as a publicist in Germany. Now they tour together, with Isabella acting as an occasional secretary, manager and agent: in between concerts they return to the peace of Gore Farm, where Gardiner enjoys the company of his daughters as much as he can. His brother inherited most of the land, farmed it for a while, but then sold up (provoking considerable family acrimony - something that seems almost traditional among Gardiner siblings). John Eliot inherited Gore Farm, and his sister moved into Springhead. Distressed by the loss of the farm, Gardiner set about trying to buy back as much as he could. As you walk around the 500 acres he has now accumulated, he points out barns and cattle sheds, explaining how that one was paid for by a stint at the Wiener Staatsoper, and that other one by a big American series. His handsome conducting income is, in large measure, ploughed back into Gore - a kind of recycling that his long-dead great uncle would no doubt have applauded. At one remove, it's easy to imagine that farming is just a quirky Gardiner hobby, a way of relaxing from the pressures of the music circuit. But he's no part-time agri-gent. When you see the man in his quilted jacket and muck-spattered boots slapping steers into weighing pens, trading plans with his stockman, and tramping over the fields to deliver his field hand's latest instructions, it's actually much harder to think of him as one of the world's most eminent, perfectionist conductors. \"The locals regard him as a farmer, who happens to do music as a bit of a sideline,\" says Suzanne Flowers. In fact, though, the farmer is intimately interwoven with the conductor. Perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of his music-making is its on-the-earth aliveness - you might almost say its organic quality. The cantata pilgrimage is like coming home for Gardiner. In recent years he has moved on from early music, recording Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann - and continuing to stack up recording awards like an Olympic athlete's trophies: the list of Grand Prix du Disque and Grammys runs on interminably. And yet, he has never run a major orchestra. He has guested with most, spent seasons with some of the greatest, led countless music festivals, and performed with most of the world's most outstanding soloists. Some musicians feel that this refusal to sign up with one of the great orchestras diminishes his status - but he is unrepentant, preferring to make music with the bands (including, more recently, the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique) that he has created himself. David Ward says: \"It's not only that he likes to do his own thing, although that's a large factor. It's also that the choir and orchestra he's created are like his family, and he is their patriarch: he's happier with them than with strangers.\" Even while spreading his repertoire wings, Eliot has remained content to treat music-making as a more or less peripatetic way of life, moving restlessly on from one event to the next, laying down a staggering career average of some six discs a year, many of them regarded as being among the outstanding contemporary recordings of the work, almost none of them duff (Edward Greenfield can only think of one, off the top of his head: a Schubert Unfinished Symphony for Erato which Gardiner inevitably reploughed for DG a little while later).The sheer energy, let alone quality, is enough to make his competitors wilt. But Bach is, for him, about as special as music gets. \"I believe that Schumann had it right when he said that the ultimate form of music-making in the west is when you bring choir and orchestra together, when you have the symbiosis of instrument and voice. And who does that better than Bach?\" Of course that union is most masterful in the B minor Mass, or the St Matthew Passion - but Gardiner says that, as he has worked through the 200 cantatas, many of which he'd never encountered before, he has been staggered not to find a single poor one among them. \"What I find fascinating about them is this constant variation on two planes at once: you hear them horizontally, as a haunting and beautiful melody, or as counterpoint or polyphony, all against the fundament of the basso continuo; and at the same time you hear them vertically, with all Bach's rhythmical bounce, his upward aspiration.\" Mostly, the texts for Bach's cantatas are not directly biblical, but drawn from a particularly esoteric strand of early 18th century Lutheran commentaries - so Gardiner does see a need to \"de-Germanise\" them. The musicologist in him connects Bach through Buxtehude and Schutz to Monteverdi and St Mark's, Venice, pointing out that Bach's multicoloured, spirited quality probably came from contemporary Italy. \"The way I approach Bach is ungermanic. I'm looking for the rhythmic zest. I believe passionately that you worship the gods in the Old Testament way, by dancing - and that of course comes from my upbringing. The aspiration [in Bach] comes from the voices, and above all the trumpets. Whenever Bach gets a trumpet out the heavens open for me.\" Curious, that this charismatically extroverted performer should be so moved, musically, by works that are at heart arcane, esoteric, in their source. And yet... after the bluster, and showmanship, all Jeggy's friends agree that the most discreet side of his personality is his faith. David Ward says: \"I'm sure this pilgrimage is, in a way, a means of proclaiming his faith.\" John Eliot Gardiner is certainly not among the most loved conductors: controversy and contumely attach to his reputation in equal measure. But he has inevitably mellowed, and bears the wounds of a turbulent personal life and professional career with reserved dignity. He is a grippingly interesting and often charming companion, more musicologically knowledgeable than most of his conducting peers. Bach's cantatas, whose eloquence principally celebrates man's ability, though flawed, to compass the heavens, seem an apt way for him to spend the 2000th year since the birth of Christ.

      "body": "<p>If, as Karl Kraus aphorised, the historian is merely a prophet facing backwards, then the science of prophecy is really the art of history facing forwards. Certainly, when thinking about what the novel might become in the next few decades, our surest guide is what the novel has been - or rather, what it has largely failed to be. For one can predict that it will go on failing in similar ways. </p> <p>Of course, this is my own emphasis, but it does seem that the creation of character, and especially the examination of consciousness, will continue to be the great quarry and greatest difficulty for the novelist.</p> <p>Consider the revolutions in the treatment of interiority that sprang up around the turn of the last century. In 1890, Knut Hamsun wrote his extraordinary, still violently modern, novel, Hunger, a portrait of fragmented and stochastic subjectivity. Hamsun, a Norwegian, had read Dostoevsky, and had taken from him the idea that stories do not simply happen to characters, but that character leads plot around like a weak dog. From Strindberg he took the notion of the soul as not a continuous wave but a storm of interruptions.</p> <p>In Hamsun, characters provoke pointless encounters which they then disown at whim. They are epistemological brawlers, always challenging meaning to a fight. Hamsun explicitly proposed his fiction as a reaction to Ibsen's more stable, structured idea of character. He lectured against Ibsen, whom he saw as a smooth purveyor of \"types\" and themes. Ten years later, Chekhov, in his milder, less programmatic way, broke with Ibsen for similar artistic reasons. \"Ibsen is no playwright,\" Chekhov complained to Stanislavsky. \"In life it simply isn't like that.\" </p> <p>\"Life,\" for Chekhov, was a bashful, milky complication, a series of dangling privacies, the very opposite of a solution. For Chekhov, as for Hamsun, Ibsen was too tidy. Twenty years later, Virginia Woolf, who had read and absorbed Chekhov, made a further, similar appeal: that the novel captures real \"life,\" and, above all, the life of consciousness.</p> <p>Woolf felt that character, to the Edwardians, was everything that could be described; for her, it was everything that could not be described. The Edwardians blunted character by stubbing it into things - politics, income, houses, clothes. She wanted to sharpen character into the invisible.</p> <p>This was not, as the John Carey/ Peter Kemp caricature has it, an evaporation into the diaphanously aesthetic. Woolf insisted on her word \"life\"; it was because she felt that life had escaped from Arnold Bennett's novels that she punished them so: \"Perhaps without life nothing else is worth while.\" I am sure that had Chekhov read Bennett, he would have said: \"Bennett is no novelist. In life it simply isn't like that.\" </p> <p>Woolf's generation might be generously expanded to include Hamsun, Chekhov and James, as well as the more usual figures like Joyce and Lawrence. All of these writers expressed a disquiet with what Lawrence famously called \"the old stable ego\" of literary character; all of them wanted to create what James once called characters in the \"plastic, irresponsible\" sense - characters of bottomless enigma - yet to do this in the service of what each of them defined (differently, of course) as \"life\" and \"realism\". And all of them thought the novel the greatest possible conduit, the very duct of life. </p> <p>These three ambitions - to create true consciousnesses with the highest artistic means; to do this as an examination of life; and to do this in the service of, and belief in, the novel as the bright book of life - still seem to me the greatest challenges for contemporary novelists, and a measure of our continued indebtedness to this period of literary history. For can it really be said that Hamsun's or Woolf's challenge is not exactly as pertinent now as it was a hundred or so years ago? </p> <p>An essay like Woolf's \"Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown\" might be written today about our current literary climate with as much force as it had in 1923. If Woolf were writing it today, she would have to acknowledge, as she had predicted, that her own generation had offered an efflorescence in the novel. But in dealing with the post-war novel, Woolf would have to acknowledge merely the varied ways in which writers had attempted, and failed, to create novelistic character and \"life,\" rather than the many successes. </p> <p>In other words, it is as hard and rare to be Chekhov now as it was a hundred years ago; and there is no reason to think this will change. In this sense, the great era of the novel in Britain ended around 1945, and has not yet begun again. (The greatest post-war novelists in English, Bellow and Beckett, were not British.) I have no doubt that it will begin again, when a writer, or a group of writers, takes seriously the novelistic function of the examination of consciousness.</p> <p>The difficulty, at present, is that most novelists are either incapable of, or theoretically hostile to, the creation of character, and, above all, deep interiority. This incapacity and hostility co-exists with a somewhat conservative era in literary fiction, in which great experiments in form and language are not expected, and not apparently desired by most people. The poorer writers simply resort to type, as they have always done; the greater writers, unwilling to do this, yet incapable of creating whole characters, use parody, critique and games to create an impression of vividly peopled fictions (Thomas Mann, Salman Rushdie, Angela Carter are obvious examples here).</p> <p>Yet the modernist period of early last century teaches us that only when language and form are placed under stress does the idea of literary character get renovated. The contemporary proof of this truth might be the self-entrapment of a writer like Ian McEwan, who has abundant intelligence and gifts, as everyone readily acknowledges, but who cannot create the deepest experiments in fictional subjectivity, despite his famously \"dark\" themes, because he will not allow his tidy control of form and language to be invaded by that very darkness. Next to Hamsun or Dostoevsky, McEwan is a relative naif, and his characters are toddlers. </p> <p>Of course, there are difficulties for contemporary novelists that are unique to our own time; we cannot simply write like Hamsun and Chekhov and Woolf and hope that contemporary consciousness will be laid bare. For consciousness, and the construction of consciousness, has changed, and is changing, rapidly. In fact, the rapidity of that change is one of the new challenges for writers.</p> <p>The reason that historical novels are nowadays almost always either failures or of no artistic merit has to do with the speed of change. Tolstoy was able to reach back 60 years to the Napoleonic Wars because he had a confidence that those 60 years had hardly made any difference to the kind of humans he was writing about; but by 1900 Henry James was warning, in his famous letter to Sarah Orne Jewett, that the historical novel was doomed precisely because the reconstruction of past consciousness could never be achieved by the novelist, and that the form always had, therefore, a \"fatal cheapness\". </p> <p>This is much more true now even than then; to reach back to 1940 is almost always to engage in bogus antiquarianism. But how impoverished we are as a result: one of the major forms of the novel at its greatest is practically denied to us. Or if not quite denied to us, then made much harder to achieve. For the pace of change makes more difficult that crucial balance that the writer must strike between the permanent and the contingent.</p> <p>What may seem here to stay has evaporated in a moment. Douglas Coupland's novel, Microserfs, for instance, is set in a Microsoft-style office, and is largely told through inter-office e-mails. It's already a slog. In 20 years' time, it will be of interest only to sociologists. The utterly vulgar and sensational Tom Wolfe - bewilderingly acclaimed in Britain as an American writer who \"brings the news\" - has produced two novels that are tied to their swiftly absconding decades (the 80s and 90s) like parole tags. They are already archival. </p> <p>It is very hard, and surely becoming harder, for the contemporary novelist to separate ephemera and trash from the truly permanent. As a result we abound in novels about ephemera and trash, in which the novelist, as it were, walks his Stendhalian mirror down Madison Avenue (or through Soho) and collects reflections. And part of that trash is not simply the new furniture of modern life, but the very quality of our consciousness.</p> <p>We have more trash in our minds, obviously enough, than humans did a century ago. More pertinently, thanks to video and television and the net, we see ourselves constantly represented and replicated. So we are more self-conscious than at any time in history; on the other hand, the low quality of most of this self-consciousness threatens to drown the self, what Lawrence called the \"quick\", the \"flame of being\". We have a very educated and theoretically refined sense of ourselves; but what self do we have? </p> <p>We might take Don DeLillo's Underworld as symptomatic of the challenges facing contemporary writers. It seems to me a relative failure. On the one hand, it is a super-contemporary novel about technology and paranoia, about systems of communication and recent history. On the other, it is a rather old-fashioned book, attempting to describe, in almost Dickensian detail, the interconnectedness of the whole of society.</p> <p>It insists on these connections, rather didactically (the atom bomb is connected in some way to baseball and to JFK and so on), as Dickens's plots insist on connections (wills, lost relatives, and so on). But, and unlike Dickens, at the level of the human, there are no connections at all, because there are no human beings in DeLillo's book, no one who really matters, and whose consciousness really matters to himself. Thus the paranoid connectedness DeLillo claims to find in American society of the last 50 years is almost entirely conceptual. DeLillo has said that he writes novels about \"the inner life of the culture\". But can you write novels about the inner life of the culture and not write about the inner life of characters? </p> <p>This will be the task of the next generation of novelists; to connect the inner life of our culture with the inner life of the human, and to describe both vividly; to achieve this evocation while not hiding from the reader that this connection has become problematic, both in actual life, and for the artist; and to fulfil this very modern challenge while holding to the older idea that the novel, of all forms, offers the greatest chance of providing this fulfilment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If, as Karl Kraus aphorised, the historian is merely a prophet facing backwards, then the science of prophecy is really the art of history facing forwards. Certainly, when thinking about what the novel might become in the next few decades, our surest guide is what the novel has been - or rather, what it has largely failed to be. For one can predict that it will go on failing in similar ways. Of course, this is my own emphasis, but it does seem that the creation of character, and especially the examination of consciousness, will continue to be the great quarry and greatest difficulty for the novelist. Consider the revolutions in the treatment of interiority that sprang up around the turn of the last century. In 1890, Knut Hamsun wrote his extraordinary, still violently modern, novel, Hunger, a portrait of fragmented and stochastic subjectivity. Hamsun, a Norwegian, had read Dostoevsky, and had taken from him the idea that stories do not simply happen to characters, but that character leads plot around like a weak dog. From Strindberg he took the notion of the soul as not a continuous wave but a storm of interruptions. In Hamsun, characters provoke pointless encounters which they then disown at whim. They are epistemological brawlers, always challenging meaning to a fight. Hamsun explicitly proposed his fiction as a reaction to Ibsen's more stable, structured idea of character. He lectured against Ibsen, whom he saw as a smooth purveyor of \"types\" and themes. Ten years later, Chekhov, in his milder, less programmatic way, broke with Ibsen for similar artistic reasons. \"Ibsen is no playwright,\" Chekhov complained to Stanislavsky. \"In life it simply isn't like that.\" \"Life,\" for Chekhov, was a bashful, milky complication, a series of dangling privacies, the very opposite of a solution. For Chekhov, as for Hamsun, Ibsen was too tidy. Twenty years later, Virginia Woolf, who had read and absorbed Chekhov, made a further, similar appeal: that the novel captures real \"life,\" and, above all, the life of consciousness. Woolf felt that character, to the Edwardians, was everything that could be described; for her, it was everything that could not be described. The Edwardians blunted character by stubbing it into things - politics, income, houses, clothes. She wanted to sharpen character into the invisible. This was not, as the John Carey/ Peter Kemp caricature has it, an evaporation into the diaphanously aesthetic. Woolf insisted on her word \"life\"; it was because she felt that life had escaped from Arnold Bennett's novels that she punished them so: \"Perhaps without life nothing else is worth while.\" I am sure that had Chekhov read Bennett, he would have said: \"Bennett is no novelist.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Mr Phillips</strong> </p> <p>John Lanchester </p> <p>247pp, Faber, \u00a316.99 </p> <p> In his first novel, the Nabokovian The Debt to Pleasure , John Lanchester presented us with a fallible narrator who is unmasked, without too much readerly effort, as a raving lunatic. The eponymous protagonist of his second is neither raving, nor a lunatic; instead, he is a chartered accountant. Not, however, a gainfully employed one, as we quickly come to realise when Mr Phillips steps off his crowded commuter train and goes walkabout in Battersea Park. It doesn't take long for Lanchester to tell us that Phillips has just been made redundant from the accounts department of Wilkins and Co, a catering services supply company; he's not even a sexy sort of accountant, then, but a bog standard number cruncher. Phillips himself, though, has not told Mrs Phillips, nor either of his two sons, one an enigmatic teenage layabout, the other a wannabe Richard Branson, nor his fellow members of the Wellesley Crescent Neighbourhood Watch Association. Which is why, on the 31st of July 1995, his first day of enforced purposelessness, he is wandering about the streets and parks of London killing time before he can make a plausible re-entry to the soothing precincts of his semi-detached Edwardian villa south of the river. </p> <p>And that, pretty much, is the story. It would be a little too much to call the events that mark Mr Phillips's ruminative and haphazard day \"adventures\", although he does, at one point, get mixed up in an armed bank robbery. Rather, his visits to the Tate Gallery, to the fleshpots of Soho, to a doctrinally hazy church, through trendy restaurant, crowded pub and held-up bank have something of the unconscious pilgrimage about them, little stations where Mr Phillips can puzzle quietly and inwardly over his failure to understand the outside world. </p> <p>Lanchester's version of London rejects the wonderment of the tourist or the obsessional zeal of the fashionable psychogeographer; as a describer of the city, he has little in common with the painstaking engagement of a writer like, for example, Alan Hollinghurst. London is portrayed here as many of its long-term residents find it, or as it finds them -always slightly too hot, slightly too weary, and slightly too full. Above all, it is just there, a cluttered backdrop both theoretically alluring and infuriatingly inconvenient. As Mr Phillips passes by skimpily dressed tennis players, art gallery eccentrics and uncouth bar staff, his thoughts are constantly re-directed towards himself and his newly voided life, on a roll that begins with the minutiae of everyday life and ends in the panicky contemplation of the unknown. </p> <p>To these considerations, he brings his professional expertise. For him, sums and statistics are roughly equal to a psychological comfort blanket, a way of measuring and regulating, ordering and subjugating. They are also the closest thing the novel has to a running gag, unless you include the constant repetition of the name \"Mr Phillips\", familiarised on only a couple of occasions by the first name Victor, daring you to be irritated. Throughout the book, our bewildered accountant, reluctant to relinquish the mental tic of reckoning, applies his numeracy skills to anything that troubles him. Frequently this is sex, with predictably amusing results. How many British women are there who are willing to be photographed in the nude? On the basis of page threes and pornographic magazines, approximately 17,000, or a town one and a half times the size of St Ives. What's the probability of your not having sex on any given day? 96.71223 per cent, of course (allowing for local and seasonal variations). </p> <p>Sex, in Mr Phillips's mind, is not just for sums, though. It runs through virtually everything, from blush-making dreams of kissing his secretary's hairy neck to the near-stalking of a TV celebrity and the poignant memory of his father's secret stash of soft porn, pictures cut neatly out of magazines and stored in a clear plastic folder. And for Mr Phillips, as the prospect of ageing and dying begins to loom larger than the pressing business of sizing up women's bottoms, it comes close to becoming memory itself. </p> <p>This is a novel primarily concerned with nostalgia, distant and partly-falsified memories and desires mediated through the clich\u00e9 of a middle-aged, middle-class, middle-of-the-road man failing to recognise the world or himself in it. Nostalgia permeates and makes a joke of the writing's sitcomish sensibility, its creation of a world that we half recognise but still know to be incomplete, and somehow not true.

      "bodyText": "Mr Phillips John Lanchester 247pp, Faber, \u00a316.99 In his first novel, the Nabokovian The Debt to Pleasure , John Lanchester presented us with a fallible narrator who is unmasked, without too much readerly effort, as a raving lunatic. The eponymous protagonist of his second is neither raving, nor a lunatic; instead, he is a chartered accountant. Not, however, a gainfully employed one, as we quickly come to realise when Mr Phillips steps off his crowded commuter train and goes walkabout in Battersea Park. It doesn't take long for Lanchester to tell us that Phillips has just been made redundant from the accounts department of Wilkins and Co, a catering services supply company; he's not even a sexy sort of accountant, then, but a bog standard number cruncher. Phillips himself, though, has not told Mrs Phillips, nor either of his two sons, one an enigmatic teenage layabout, the other a wannabe Richard Branson, nor his fellow members of the Wellesley Crescent Neighbourhood Watch Association. Which is why, on the 31st of July 1995, his first day of enforced purposelessness, he is wandering about the streets and parks of London killing time before he can make a plausible re-entry to the soothing precincts of his semi-detached Edwardian villa south of the river. And that, pretty much, is the story. It would be a little too much to call the events that mark Mr Phillips's ruminative and haphazard day \"adventures\", although he does, at one point, get mixed up in an armed bank robbery. Rather, his visits to the Tate Gallery, to the fleshpots of Soho, to a doctrinally hazy church, through trendy restaurant, crowded pub and held-up bank have something of the unconscious pilgrimage about them, little stations where Mr Phillips can puzzle quietly and inwardly over his failure to understand the outside world. Lanchester's version of London rejects the wonderment of the tourist or the obsessional zeal of the fashionable psychogeographer; as a describer of the city, he has little in common with the painstaking engagement of a writer like, for example, Alan Hollinghurst. London is portrayed here as many of its long-term residents find it, or as it finds them -always slightly too hot, slightly too weary, and slightly too full. Above all, it is just there, a cluttered backdrop both theoretically alluring and infuriatingly inconvenient. As Mr Phillips passes by skimpily dressed tennis players, art gallery eccentrics and uncouth bar staff, his thoughts are constantly re-directed towards himself and his newly voided life, on a roll that begins with the minutiae of everyday life and ends in the panicky contemplation of the unknown. To these considerations, he brings his professional expertise. For him, sums and statistics are roughly equal to a psychological comfort blanket, a way of measuring and regulating, ordering and subjugating. They are also the closest thing the novel has to a running gag, unless you include the constant repetition of the name \"Mr Phillips\", familiarised on only a couple of occasions by the first name Victor, daring you to be irritated. Throughout the book, our bewildered accountant, reluctant to relinquish the mental tic of reckoning, applies his numeracy skills to anything that troubles him. Frequently this is sex, with predictably amusing results. How many British women are there who are willing to be photographed in the nude? On the basis of page threes and pornographic magazines, approximately 17,000, or a town one and a half times the size of St Ives. What's the probability of your not having sex on any given day? 96.71223 per cent, of course (allowing for local and seasonal variations). Sex, in Mr Phillips's mind, is not just for sums, though. It runs through virtually everything, from blush-making dreams of kissing his secretary's hairy neck to the near-stalking of a TV celebrity and the poignant memory of his father's secret stash of soft porn, pictures cut neatly out of magazines and stored in a clear plastic folder. And for Mr Phillips, as the prospect of ageing and dying begins to loom larger than the pressing business of sizing up women's bottoms, it comes close to becoming memory itself. This is a novel primarily concerned with nostalgia, distant and partly-falsified memories and desires mediated through the clich\u00e9 of a middle-aged, middle-class, middle-of-the-road man failing to recognise the world or himself in it. Nostalgia permeates and makes a joke of the writing's sitcomish sensibility, its creation of a world that we half recognise but still know to be incomplete, and somehow not true. The situation relies on a life in which loaf-haired secretaries bring their bosses digestive biscuits balanced on a saucer, and Residents' Associations gather to mull ineffectively over the noise from the flight-path. The comedy is Lanchester's finest balancing act, a series of subtle and minute adjustments that allow us to see Mr Phillips one minute as acute and sensitive observer, the other as faintly ridiculous, Prufrockishly cautious and Pooterishly pedantic. \"The man looks like a swot but also randy and quite nice - you are on his side.\" That's Mr Phillips's judgment on Stanley Spencer as he stands before his self-portrait in the Tate, and one that we are covertly encouraged to apply to him. There are moments in this masterly display of authorial control when things go awry, and they most usually occur when Lanchester goes too far in a joke, and loses sight of his character. It's humorous enough, for example, to think of Mr Phillips's fantasy of the Neighbourhood Watch approaching Mujahedeen guerrillas for the loan of a Stinger missile to shoot down a jumbo jet, but dwelt on and filled in too much to smack very convincingly of the fillers of real life's idle moments; it's akin to that sinking, disappointing sensation you get when you see the gag coming and suddenly your face straightens, in spite of your willingness to laugh. Lanchester, here as in The Debt to Pleasure , does not always conceal the scribbles and workings in the margin, and there's an uncomfortable sense of self-conscious cleverness at play, all the more disappointing because he is clever. And yet this homage to the extraordinariness of ordinariness, to the weird goulash of desire, shame, embarrassment, fear and desperation that characterises most people's inner lives, works far more often than it does not.

The stands at the Maracana were empty, the game between Manchester United and Necaxa was poor. Fifa's talk yesterday of holding the competition every year would have seemed a bad joke. </p> <p>Come 6.59, though, Beckham changed everything. One lunge with his studs into Jose Milian's thigh and the tournament hit the front pages, the back pages and news broadcasts worldwide. The crowd awoke, the match came to life. In a strange way Fifa may have been delighted yesterday to give the midfielder a one-match ban. </p> <p>After the publicity came the credibility, to Fifa's delight. The determination of United's second-half performance cast aside any doubts that they were here for the ride. The noise and colour during Vasco da Gama's victory over South Mel bourne was a joy. As United prepare to play Vasco this evening, there is a genuine sense of excitement around. The BBC must be delighted. </p> <p>\"You saw the atmosphere during the Vasco game,\" said United's manager Sir Alex Ferguson. \"That's the sort of thing you want to be involved in. That's why we are happy to be here.\" No wonder Fifa was happy to announce it hopes to make this an annual, January extravaganza. </p> <p>\"Every one of our tournaments, even the 1930 World Cup, has started off somewhat experimentally,\" said its communications director Keith Cooper, \"and every one has been retained, so you might draw your certain conclusions from that. It would appear only to make sense to take place annually.\" </p> <p>The next tournament is likely to take place in December 2001 but after that Fifa wants to gather the champions every year. It will invite tenders from national associations to host the tournament. Brazil won out this time over seven other bidders. The bad news for the FA Cup, Ferguson and United's chairman Martin Edwards is that new year is seen as the logical time. What chance a Premiership winter break? </p> <p>Not surprisingly it was Beckham's clash with Milian which grabbed more attention yesterday. The 24-year-old's suspension came with an \u00a3800 (2,000 Swiss francs) fine, which will probably not break the bank. Ferguson's punishment for his sending-off was a one-match ban from the technical area and \u00a32,000 fine. United have asked Fifa to donate the money to a local children's charity, part of a charm offensive after their bad publicity in the Brazilian press. \"I think the case of David is fair,\" said Ferguson, who will be allowed in the dressing room this evening and can communicate with the bench from the stands. \"There was a worry for us that it would be carried on to the European Cup.\" </p> <p>More worrying for Ferguson is that Beckham has not learnt from his mistakes. Still he cannot contain his frustrations or control his emotions. His reckless challenge on Thursday was far more serious than his kick at Argentina's Diego Simeone in the 1998 World Cup. He can expect to become even more of a target for fans and fellow players now. </p> <p>Given the abuse he received, in English, from Vasco fans on Thursday it may be just as well he cannot play tonight. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will most likely take his place. Assuming he returns against South Melbourne on Tuesday, one or two extra viewers might tune in to discover whether Australia's footballers are as good at sledging as their cricketing counterparts. </p> <p>Ferguson, as expected, continued to defend his player in public yesterday, though it is more than likely he has taken him to task in private. He said he had not watched a replay but reiterated his initial view: \"I think the [Necaxa] lad's come flying in. [Beckham's] put his leg up to protect himself and I think it's turned out looking more nasty than it was. I still maintain the Mexican players got him sent off with their reaction.\" </p> <p>Ferguson's protective approach is understandable given the damage caused by Glenn Hoddle's remark in St Etienne and his realisation that much with Beckham can be blown out of proportion. He is reluctant to criticise his players at the best of times and declined to discuss the midfielder's worrying temperament. \"I'm not going to add to your agenda,\" he said. </p> <p>He must be concerned, though. Beckham's predicament is hardly helped by Posh Spice. Her \"knickers\" comment proved again that she is a dangerously loose cannon. Her love of publicity has too often rebounded in her husband's face. </p> <p>\"I feel sorry for him as a player,\" the former Brazil international Jairzinho said yesterday. \"He let his temperature go higher than you normally do without thinking. I'm sure Beckham is feeling a bit of regret. </p> <p>\"I feel sorry especially for the Brazilian people who paid to watch the game and know him from the World Cup. They wanted to see him because he's a star and now he's done that.\" Presumably, though, Vasco fans will not be devastated by his absence from the crucial tie tonight. </p> <p>Ferguson might be a little upset to discover that the referee, Kuwait's Saad Kamel Mane, was the fourth official he upset on Thursday. \"We are coming to a situation where Vasco da Gama are in front of their own fans, their own climate, maybe their own ref,\" he said. Not surprisingly, before the interpreter could translate he insisted that was a joke.</p>",

He must be concerned, though. Beckham's predicament is hardly helped by Posh Spice. Her \"knickers\" comment proved again that she is a dangerously loose cannon. Her love of publicity has too often rebounded in her husband's face. \"I feel sorry for him as a player,\" the former Brazil international Jairzinho said yesterday. \"He let his temperature go higher than you normally do without thinking. I'm sure Beckham is feeling a bit of regret. \"I feel sorry especially for the Brazilian people who paid to watch the game and know him from the World Cup. They wanted to see him because he's a star and now he's done that.\" Presumably, though, Vasco fans will not be devastated by his absence from the crucial tie tonight. Ferguson might be a little upset to discover that the referee, Kuwait's Saad Kamel Mane, was the fourth official he upset on Thursday. \"We are coming to a situation where Vasco da Gama are in front of their own fans, their own climate, maybe their own ref,\" he said. Not surprisingly, before the interpreter could translate he insisted that was a joke.",

Everyone followed Elder's beat minutely, but it was the vitality and beauty of the phrasing which held the ear. Parts of The Mask of Time that had previously seemed fatally opaque suddenly made sense. Tippett's melodic lines, even at their most angular and dislocated, really breathed. In so many performances one is too often aware of singers desperately trying to hold on to the notes. But Elder put musical understanding first. And his achievement in communicating that understanding to the performers was simply phenomenal. If this is a foretaste of what his directorship of the Hall\u00e9 is to be like (Elder takes up his post in September), Manchester is set for a great musical adventure.</p>",

What impressed above all, though, was the sheer musicality of this performance. Everyone followed Elder's beat minutely, but it was the vitality and beauty of the phrasing which held the ear. Parts of The Mask of Time that had previously seemed fatally opaque suddenly made sense. Tippett's melodic lines, even at their most angular and dislocated, really breathed. In so many performances one is too often aware of singers desperately trying to hold on to the notes. But Elder put musical understanding first. And his achievement in communicating that understanding to the performers was simply phenomenal. If this is a foretaste of what his directorship of the Hall\u00e9 is to be like (Elder takes up his post in September), Manchester is set for a great musical adventure.",

It helps that in Attenborough's production, the two men are seen as blood brothers: both products of the same rigid, unbending military ethos that finds its crudest expression in the homoerotic nocturnal revels and drinking bouts in Cyprus. </p> <p>And McCabe's excellent Iago is defined entirely by his profession.

      "body": "<p>If you've got some Christmas present money to stash away on behalf of your children, is it possible to find a profitable home for it via the internet? </p> <p>The short answer is that you or your child can get a lot of useful information from the net on the various deposit accounts and equity-based investments aimed at young savers. But I've yet to come across any providers whose websites allow you to open an account or buy into a fund online. </p> <p>Bank and building society children's accounts, which usually offer free gifts and magazines to tempt children, provide a useful home for smallish cash gifts. Children from age seven can get an early introduction to the savings habit by operating their own account, which they can add to with pocket money deposits and make withdrawals from. Parents generally need to open and operate accounts for younger children. </p> <p>The financial search site <a href=\"http://www.moneyworld.co.uk\">www.moneyworld.co.uk</a> is a useful place to start. Here you can quickly call up the best high street rates available on children's accounts. Unfortunately, by sticking to a short list of major providers, it doesn't paint a complete picture. </p> <p>Missing are some high interest paying children's accounts offered by smaller building societies such as Lambeth's new Cat's Whiskers instant-access account which is paying an attractive 6.5% gross on deposits of \u00a3100 or more. It also misses out those societies offering good rates to children of local residents such as the Saffron Walden's Ladybird account, currently paying 6.4% on \u00a31 or more. </p> <p>For a fuller list of children's account providers, you'll have to leave your screen and pop down to your local library for a look at the rates tables in Moneyfacts' monthly guide to personal finance or call Moneyfacts, whose website is still under construction, for a one-off complimentary copy on 01603 476100. </p> <p>The best high street buy just now is Nationwide's Smart 2 Save account, which is open to children up to age 12 and is paying 6.4% on deposits of \u00a31 or more. Nationwide's website on <a href=\"http://www.nationwide.co.uk\">www.nationwide.co.uk</a> wins my vote as one of the clearest and most straightforward to use with particular merit for aiming certain screens directly at children. Clicking the \"young savers 0-12 yrs\" icon brings you directly into details of Smart 2 Save including the option to click on \"I'm 7 or over and I want to do it myself\". </p> <p>Up comes a child-friendly screen explaining that, to open an account, the child will need to come into a branch armed with at least \u00a31, their birth certificate, proof of their address (such as a gas, electricity or phone bill to your parents' address) and a completed application form. They can click on an icon to e-mail for a form sent by return of post and ask any questions they fancy. </p> <p>This screen also waves the account's freebie carrots under your youngster's nose. Their welcome pack will include a wallchart, money box, a pencil with a monkey eraser and free entry to one of a range of zoos and other family attractions if they go with a full paying adult. </p> <p>Also attractive to kids is the facility to click on to the Monkey House, a screen which tells young browsers about Nationwide's sponsorship of the Tamarin monkeys at London Zoo. Users are invited to e-mail their questions about monkeys and send in drawings, some of which will be reprinted on the website. </p> <p>Lambeth's website on <a href=\"http://www.lambeth.co.uk\">www.lambeth.co.uk</a> is also clear and attractive. Click on the first item on its first screen and up comes full details of its Cat's Whiskers account illustrated with moving images of domestic and wild cats. </p> <p>I had a frustrating time trying to download an application form and make a request for literature to be sent, but was assured by head office when I rang to query this that the problem was rare. \"It's a problem with the server. There's a break in the link somewhere and we are on to them to sort it out. It's best in the meantime to ring our freephone number on 0500 200020.\" You can normally download and print off an application form in seconds, they said, which you fill in, sign and send by post. </p> <p>This is the best method most children's account websites offer. So why can't you open an account online? Lambeth says it's all to do with money laundering regulations which make it mandatory for providers to physically see proof of identification when a child, or an adult for that matter, wants to open a savings account. Nationwide, on the other hand, says it can open card-based accounts online but it makes no sense to offer online opening of passbook type accounts, including children's accounts, because all transactions thereafter have to be carried out through a branch in order to update the passbook. </p> <p>Whatever the reasons, you can't yet open a children's account on screen. But you can make an online request to be sent literature and an application for accounts on most societies' websites. This includes Coventry's Interest Zone account (<a href=\"http://www.covbsoc.co.uk\">www.covbsoc.co.uk</a>), Bradford &amp; Bingley's KidZone account (<a href=\"http://www.bradford-bingley.co.uk\">www.bradford-bingley.co.uk</a>) and Birmingham Midshires' SmartStart account (www.birmingham-midshires.co.uk). </p> <p>Most children are non taxpayers because they earn less than the annual personal tax allowance of \u00a34,335. They also have a capital gains tax allowance of \u00a37,100. So, they don't have to pay income or capital gains tax on their sav ings and investments. To get tax-free gross interest paid on a child's bank or building society account, you will need to register them as a non-taxpayer by filling in form R85. This will normally be included with the application form. </p> <p>A child's tax-free amount depends on who gave them the money to invest in the first place. If it comes from anyone other than the parents, it is treated as their own. But if it comes from a parent, only the first \u00a3100 is tax-free. The rest is taxed at the parents' highest rate. </p> <p>For wealthy kids with sizeable cash gifts to invest over the longer term, it's worth looking at pooled equity-based funds like unit and investment trusts, a few of which are marketed for children. These are not so attractive for small investors because of costly charges and relatively high minimum investment rules - most such savings vehicles demand a minimum of \u00a350 a month or a lump sum of \u00a3500. </p> <p>Giant fund manager M&amp;G has recently issued a free guide Investing for Children, a copy of which you can request online via its website on <a href=\"http://www.mandg.co.uk\">www.mandg.co.uk</a> or by calling 0800 210 200. The website offers a clear guide to M&amp;G's 40-odd unit trusts - but, again, you cannot invest online. You can download and print off an application form to complete and send in by post, but it is quicker and easier to call M&amp;G's dealing line on 0800 328 3196 where you can complete your transaction over the phone. </p> <p>The same story is true for Save &amp; Prosper's new website on <a href=\"http://www.prosper.co.uk\">www.prosper.co.uk</a> which goes live this weekend. S&amp;P have also published a new guide, Saving for Children, which you can order online or download and print off.</p>",

Nationwide's website on www.nationwide.co.uk wins my vote as one of the clearest and most straightforward to use with particular merit for aiming certain screens directly at children. Clicking the \"young savers 0-12 yrs\" icon brings you directly into details of Smart 2 Save including the option to click on \"I'm 7 or over and I want to do it myself\". Up comes a child-friendly screen explaining that, to open an account, the child will need to come into a branch armed with at least \u00a31, their birth certificate, proof of their address (such as a gas, electricity or phone bill to your parents' address) and a completed application form. They can click on an icon to e-mail for a form sent by return of post and ask any questions they fancy. This screen also waves the account's freebie carrots under your youngster's nose. Their welcome pack will include a wallchart, money box, a pencil with a monkey eraser and free entry to one of a range of zoos and other family attractions if they go with a full paying adult. Also attractive to kids is the facility to click on to the Monkey House, a screen which tells young browsers about Nationwide's sponsorship of the Tamarin monkeys at London Zoo. Users are invited to e-mail their questions about monkeys and send in drawings, some of which will be reprinted on the website. Lambeth's website on www.lambeth.co.uk is also clear and attractive. Click on the first item on its first screen and up comes full details of its Cat's Whiskers account illustrated with moving images of domestic and wild cats. I had a frustrating time trying to download an application form and make a request for literature to be sent, but was assured by head office when I rang to query this that the problem was rare. \"It's a problem with the server. There's a break in the link somewhere and we are on to them to sort it out. It's best in the meantime to ring our freephone number on 0500 200020.\" You can normally download and print off an application form in seconds, they said, which you fill in, sign and send by post. This is the best method most children's account websites offer. So why can't you open an account online? Lambeth says it's all to do with money laundering regulations which make it mandatory for providers to physically see proof of identification when a child, or an adult for that matter, wants to open a savings account. Nationwide, on the other hand, says it can open card-based accounts online but it makes no sense to offer online opening of passbook type accounts, including children's accounts, because all transactions thereafter have to be carried out through a branch in order to update the passbook. Whatever the reasons, you can't yet open a children's account on screen. But you can make an online request to be sent literature and an application for accounts on most societies' websites. This includes Coventry's Interest Zone account (www.covbsoc.co.uk), Bradford &amp; Bingley's KidZone account (www.bradford-bingley.co.uk) and Birmingham Midshires' SmartStart account (www.birmingham-midshires.co.uk). Most children are non taxpayers because they earn less than the annual personal tax allowance of \u00a34,335. They also have a capital gains tax allowance of \u00a37,100. So, they don't have to pay income or capital gains tax on their sav ings and investments. To get tax-free gross interest paid on a child's bank or building society account, you will need to register them as a non-taxpayer by filling in form R85. This will normally be included with the application form. A child's tax-free amount depends on who gave them the money to invest in the first place. If it comes from anyone other than the parents, it is treated as their own. But if it comes from a parent, only the first \u00a3100 is tax-free. The rest is taxed at the parents' highest rate. For wealthy kids with sizeable cash gifts to invest over the longer term, it's worth looking at pooled equity-based funds like unit and investment trusts, a few of which are marketed for children. These are not so attractive for small investors because of costly charges and relatively high minimum investment rules - most such savings vehicles demand a minimum of \u00a350 a month or a lump sum of \u00a3500. Giant fund manager M&amp;G has recently issued a free guide Investing for Children, a copy of which you can request online via its website on www.mandg.co.uk or by calling 0800 210 200. The website offers a clear guide to M&amp;G's 40-odd unit trusts - but, again, you cannot invest online. You can download and print off an application form to complete and send in by post, but it is quicker and easier to call M&amp;G's dealing line on 0800 328 3196 where you can complete your transaction over the phone. The same story is true for Save &amp; Prosper's new website on www.prosper.co.uk which goes live this weekend. S&amp;P have also published a new guide, Saving for Children, which you can order online or download and print off.",
