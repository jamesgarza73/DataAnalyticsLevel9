At the age of 10 he was profoundly influenced by the landing of the Prince of Wales's aircraft on the beach at Pembury, Carmarthenshire. Educated at Twyford preparatory school and Winchester College, he joined the Officers Air Training Corps and by 1940 had decided to make the RAF his career, joining at Lord's cricket ground in August 1942. He undertook his flying training in the United States, returning to Britain in December 1943 and joining Bomber Command in 1944.

There was the Vickers Valiant, the first of the RAF's V-bombers which was to provide the original British nuclear deterrent capability; the big Vanguard turbo-prop airliner; the VC10 and super VC10 civil and military rear-engined intercontinental jetliners; and the BAC 1-11 regional twin-jet airliner. In 1961 he became Vickers' chief test pilot.</p> <p>Trubshaw's big move was to become director of flight tests and chief test pilot of British Aircraft Corporation/British Aerospace from 1965 to 1980, heading the British share of the Anglo-French Concorde flight test programme at Fairford. His final six years were then spent as director and general manager of the British Aerospace Filton site before his obligatory retirement in 1986 at the age of 62. Thereafter, he became a widely sought after aviation consultant. He was notably in charge of the flying displays at successive Farnborough air shows for many years and a board member of the British Civil Aviation Authority for six years.</p> <p>He wrote two excellent books, putting on record much of his exceptional test flying experience - Brian Trubshaw: Test Pilot, (1988), and Concorde: The Inside Story (2000), which ironically was published only days before the loss of the Air France Concorde near Paris last July.

During 33 years in the lobbies of Westminster he dug out more scoops and exposed more hidden truth about government than most of his peers could imagine possible. He was a one-off, unbound by false respect or comforting convention - qualities that ensured he was adored by close friends and colleagues, and maddened those he antagonised.</p> <p>Yet even the many politicians and hacks whose complacencies and evasions he revealed regarded him with a wary admiration.

Educated at Liverpool Collegiate School and the London School of Economics, he was the son of the only working class Tory minister in Harold Macmillan's cabinet - Reggie Bevins, who turned Disraeli's phrase \"the greasy pole\" into common currency when he wrote a book of that title describing - shockingly frankly - the morally corrupting machinations that people will engage in to remain in the political ascendancy.</p> <p>This background gave Tony an almost intuitive grasp of the way politics worked. It enabled him frequently to fight the tide of received Westminster opinion - oh yes, lobby journalists really do agree among themselves what view they are going to take, and many of them hated Tony for standing apart.</p> <p>After a year in Bengal on Voluntary Service Overseas, where he met his wife, Mishtu, Bevins started at the Liverpool Post in 1967, moved to London as its lobby man in 1970, and then on to the political staff of the Sunday Express in 1973. Later that year he became the Sun's political correspondent, moving to the Daily Mail in 1976. In 1981 he became chief political correspondent of the Times but when Rupert Murdoch herded that paper's staff over to Wapping Bevins stood in the final union chapel meeting and told his colleagues, \"I will go to Wapping with ashes in my mouth\".</p> <p>Along with Sarah Hogg and myself he was the first to walk from Wapping to join Andreas Whittam Smith working on something we then knew as the \"Daily Arthur\" - what became the Independent in 1986. Those were his outstanding years, journalistically. Bevins, as the Independent's first political editor, created a small cadre of young political reporters, teaching them not to lean on the comfortable props governments provide, but to treasure the evidence of their own sources.</p> <p>He was the first political editor to step formally outside the daily Number 10 lobby briefings, believing passionately at the time that they had become a feeding bottle for the press. He was never partisan in the party sense - but everyone close to him knew that he detested what Margaret Thatcher had done to the communities of Britain. Behind the wild delight in making journalistic mischief, his journalism was driven utterly by a ferocious ethical intent. Even she respected him, though: no one who was there will forget the moment during the 1987 general election campaign when he stood at the back of the morning Tory press conference with his hand raised throughout, while Thatcher studiously avoided calling him to ask his question. Finally, and condescendingly, she relented: \"Now Mister Bevins, it's your turn.\"</p> <p>Tony, always impeccably polite, asked: 'Prime Minister, can you tell us - if you admire the National Health Service so much why don't you use it?' The silence was sliceable.</p> <p>Tony and Mishtu's searingly honest, openly emotional relationship made for legendary dinners at their home in Cookham, Berkshire, eating the best curry this side of Calcutta, fighting over politics, reciting Tagore aloud in the original over the eau de vie at 4am. Out on the road, at party conferences, he would always choose one night to stay up till dawn drinking. It was on one such night that he threw punches at Bruce Anderson, the right-wing hack, who had decided it might be amusing to bait Bevins on the matter of race. For \"Ani\", as Tony's two half-Bengali children Rabi and Nandini always called him, race was not an issue that could ever be treated lightly.</p> <p>Bevins was frequently garlanded by peers who recognised his unique talents. In 1990 he won the What The Papers Say political reporter of the year award for being the only political journalist to persist with the stalking horse story that finally led to Thatcher being toppled. There is little doubt that his reporting was instrumental in her demise. In 1993 he was joint winner of the British Press Awards exclusive of the year for scooping the world on the Tory Government's secret talks with the IRA in the early 1990s - in the Observer, where he moved in 1993 after the Independent.</p> <p>He returned to the Indy in 1996, and then moved on to the Express in 1998.

Sir Richard Branson is also considering plans to start Virgin Atlantic operations to the Middle East following meetings in Dubai last week.

They are an invisible workforce, the only sign of whose presence is the cleanliness and order they leave behind.

Disturbingly, the brutal politics of class, race and exploitation are masked by \"the peace of mutual indifference\" as the sociologist Richard Sennett phrased it in a recent essay on the decline of urban civic culture.

But New Labour, fearful of a conflict with big business, takes the traditional right-wing route of ignoring the economic causes of civic decline, and pins the responsibility firmly on the individual. Labour rhetoric treats us as a nation of lazy couch-potatoes, and subjects us to sermons on the walk-by culture.</p> <p>But look what happens when someone does get off the couch. Rosie (her name has been changed) has had enough. She's worked as cook for an east London hospital for 10 years, and the contract has now been taken over by Compass Granada. Her verdict is: \"They don't know anything about catering, us girls tell them how to run things. I wish they'd stayed on the motorways.\" She objects to being moved from contract to contract, she objects to the permanent understaffing which results in frequent arguments with the management. And, she objects to her pay, \u00a36 an hour for a 39-hour week, with little left over after the rent and bills. She often ends up working seven days a week and double shifts to make ends meet, yet she counts herself as one of the lucky ones, whose conditions are legally protected. Those getting new contracts and doing the same work can earn as little as \u00a34.75 an hour. Rosie, now in her fifties, is exactly the kind of essential worker who is now being forced out of central London through a combination of low wages and high housing costs.</p> <p>Rosie is one of hundreds who have joined the Living Wage campaign organised by Telco (the East London Community Organisation) and Unison, to be launched next week. The campaign is based on a US model where a new generation of organisations, drawn initially from faith communities and human rights groups and subsequently teaming up with unions, have succeeded in getting \"living wages\" as a condition of contracts with public authorities in scores of US cities.</p> <p>The Living Wage campaign's first target is the Greater London Authority's \u00a33bn budget, but if the condition was built into every public contract, they argue, it would have a bigger impact on poverty across the east of London than any of the huge regeneration grants the government routinely pours into the area. So what is Labour's response? Here is a grassroots organisation working with some of the most marginalised groups, tackling poverty: it hits all Labour's favourite buttons. Yet, so far, not one local Labour MP has agreed to turn up to the launch of the campaign. Financial secretary, Stephen Timms, a long-time supporter of Telco, admits privately he's sympathetic, but can't publicly endorse a challenge to the minimum wage. Only Nicky Gavron, London's deputy mayor, to her credit, has promised to sign up.</p> <p>The Living Wage campaign exposes the bind Labour is in. It is an excellent instance of Gordon Brown's much-trailed \"renewal of civic society\" and his proclamation of a \"new era - an age of active citizenship and an enabling state\" earlier this year. But what he envisaged was nice, malleable volunteers running toddler groups for Sure Start rather than those women gaining the confidence to challenge the whole system which consigns their children to poverty in the first place. A curiously macho muscular language of weight-lifting has crept into poverty policy: Brown boasts of New Labour's lifting women and children out of poverty - but woe betide anyone uppity enough to want to do it for themselves.</p> <p>Worst of all is how Rosie's low wages are a massive rip-off on us, the taxpayer. Prem Sikka of Essex University has compiled a top 50 list of companies with the highest differentials between the pay of the top and the bottom. Based on 1998-99 figures, Compass Granada came 19th; the highest paid director earned \u00a31m and the average wages among the workforce were \u00a311,000. Another big player scooping up government contracts is Rentokil Initial: the highest paid director was on \u00a31.5m, compared to \u00a39,000 at the bottom. Between 1990-99, Rentokil Initial's profits soared from \u00a374.6m to \u00a3541.1m.</p> <p>These kinds of profits are not a mystery of the market. In large part, they're made of our money. Firstly, it is our taxes which pay, through the local authorities, hospitals and schools, for the contracts with the like of Rentokil Initial and Compass Granada. Secondly, when those profits don't translate into living wages, it is our taxes, again, which pay for the tax credits, benefits and low-cost housing which are necessary to subsidise their employees. Plus there are the things which get missed off a balance sheet such as stress, but most importantly, the dignity and self-worth of people like Rosie in earning a decent wage for themselves so they don't have to rely on Mr Brown's muscles.</p> <p>If the Living Wage campaigns can work in the US, hardly known as a model of good labour relations, it can work here. It's about time the taxpayer, let alone Rosie, got a bigger pay-back from the companies making millions out of public contracts.

Come 4.30pm, you're shifting your neck, this way and that, in your prickly collar, and squirming about in your seat. Ants in your pants because it's the weekend. Would they notice if you sloped off just 30 minutes early so you can primp your hair and curl your lashes before hitting the town? Despite the fact that all we want to do is go home and get drunk, senior executives have conspired to come up with the most hair-brained schemes imaginable to keep us office-bound and enthused on Friday afternoons. We are all well-acquainted with the mongrelish horror of dress down Fridays. Three hundred people lurching around in Gap khakis, instinctively clutching at the place where their ties ought to be. But what do companies hope to achieve by forcing us into our casual clobber? And more to the point, why Fridays? Do they think we won't notice it is a work day? Perhaps it is just a corporate method of integrating us back into society before we are forced to pursue weekend activities such as mowing the lawn and having a kickabout in the park with the lads.

Or what about those unreported loose floor tiles that send staff into a finely choreographed dance to avoid landing face down. From spillages to appalling lighting, health and safety matters at work really do matter. Recent statistics by the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH) reveal that, each year, around 25 people between the ages of 16 and 24 are killed at work in the UK, with a further 18,000 suffering injuries, many of them serious. And that's just the young guys. </p> <p>Young people's safety is the theme of the institution's latest position statement. Representing more than 25,000 health and safety professionals, the IOSH considers it vital that young people are prepared for a safer working life. Head of professional affairs, Hazel Harvey, says: \"It's a well-known fact that young people are most vulnerable in their first few weeks at work. They lack the experience of being in a work environment and have often come from an education culture where things are done in a very safe manner. This is not necessarily the case at work.\" </p> <p>From construction sites to offices - any young person beginning work for the first time will naturally be anxious if not a little discombobulated - they also lack the vocabulary of safety. \"Young folk tend to do more mundane things, so they might be asked to move something heavy and, instead of using a trolley, they might think that because they are strong they can just lift it. What seems obvious to us may not to them - they may not realise how easy it is to hurt yourself when lifting things incorrectly,\" explains Harvey. </p> <p>Recent figures released by the TUC reveal that younger staff are also more likely than older people to suffer from repetitive strain injury. An alarming 78% of younger workers perform jobs in which there is a repetition of a sequence of movements, and more than half the UK's 4m workers aged between 16 and 24 are performing their duties while sitting awkwardly or uncomfortably. Accident books at work are likely to be full of little more than falls, slips and trips - most accidents in offices occur when staff are carrying loads and usually because of neglected floor conditions. Poor lighting and untidiness are also the cause of many injuries. Under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, if you have a contract of employment, it is up to your boss to ensure you are not exposed to unnecessary risk. However, you do have a legal duty to \"take reasonable care of yourself and others\" and to \"cooperate with your employer\" to reach health and safety standards. </p> <p>This means keeping a vigilant eye out for the common causes such as: trailing leads likely to cause falls; spillages, which should be reported immediately (do not assume it is someone else's responsibility, chances are if you ignored it so might they); loose flooring, get someone on the case before there is an office pile-up; staircases should be well lit with handrails - if not, ask your employer to do something; blocked passageways and corridors are not too clever either, they are a major fire risk, ask for the stuff to be shifted and pronto. </p> <p>By law, employers are required to identify and train employees on health and safety issues of any job. Under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, you must be given induction training when recruited and further training when increased risks are introduced into your job. Under the Employment Rights Act 1996, you also have the right to refuse to do anything that would place you in \"serious and imminent danger\". By law, your employer must publicise the company's safety policy - usually this ends up as a large poster with a lot of small print that nobody reads. </p> <p>Make sure that you are getting enough light, preferably natural light, to avoid problems of visual fatigue. Each permanent employee is also entitled to 11 cubic metres of space, so you might just want to get out the measuring tape. Health and safety also covers welfare rights - wholesome drinking water should be provided and there should be a rest area where you can relax in a non-smoking environment. For most office workers, however, a vital safety issue is the layout of the desk and terminal. How, where and on what you sit are crucial - your work area should be ergonomically sound. </p> <p>If a reportable injury does occur, it should be recorded. Include the date, time and place of the event, personal details of all involved and the nature of the occurrence and contact your safety rep. If there is no union organisation at work, contact the health and safety executive, which is the main enforcement body in the UK. </p> <p>\u0095 Free copies of Preparing young people for a safer working life are available from IOSH, tel: 0116-257 3100, fax: 0116-257 3101.

This is not necessarily the case at work.\" From construction sites to offices - any young person beginning work for the first time will naturally be anxious if not a little discombobulated - they also lack the vocabulary of safety. \"Young folk tend to do more mundane things, so they might be asked to move something heavy and, instead of using a trolley, they might think that because they are strong they can just lift it. What seems obvious to us may not to them - they may not realise how easy it is to hurt yourself when lifting things incorrectly,\" explains Harvey. Recent figures released by the TUC reveal that younger staff are also more likely than older people to suffer from repetitive strain injury. An alarming 78% of younger workers perform jobs in which there is a repetition of a sequence of movements, and more than half the UK's 4m workers aged between 16 and 24 are performing their duties while sitting awkwardly or uncomfortably. Accident books at work are likely to be full of little more than falls, slips and trips - most accidents in offices occur when staff are carrying loads and usually because of neglected floor conditions. Poor lighting and untidiness are also the cause of many injuries. Under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, if you have a contract of employment, it is up to your boss to ensure you are not exposed to unnecessary risk. However, you do have a legal duty to \"take reasonable care of yourself and others\" and to \"cooperate with your employer\" to reach health and safety standards. This means keeping a vigilant eye out for the common causes such as: trailing leads likely to cause falls; spillages, which should be reported immediately (do not assume it is someone else's responsibility, chances are if you ignored it so might they); loose flooring, get someone on the case before there is an office pile-up; staircases should be well lit with handrails - if not, ask your employer to do something; blocked passageways and corridors are not too clever either, they are a major fire risk, ask for the stuff to be shifted and pronto. By law, employers are required to identify and train employees on health and safety issues of any job. Under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, you must be given induction training when recruited and further training when increased risks are introduced into your job. Under the Employment Rights Act 1996, you also have the right to refuse to do anything that would place you in \"serious and imminent danger\". By law, your employer must publicise the company's safety policy - usually this ends up as a large poster with a lot of small print that nobody reads. Make sure that you are getting enough light, preferably natural light, to avoid problems of visual fatigue. Each permanent employee is also entitled to 11 cubic metres of space, so you might just want to get out the measuring tape. Health and safety also covers welfare rights - wholesome drinking water should be provided and there should be a rest area where you can relax in a non-smoking environment. For most office workers, however, a vital safety issue is the layout of the desk and terminal. How, where and on what you sit are crucial - your work area should be ergonomically sound. If a reportable injury does occur, it should be recorded. Include the date, time and place of the event, personal details of all involved and the nature of the occurrence and contact your safety rep. If there is no union organisation at work, contact the health and safety executive, which is the main enforcement body in the UK. \u0095 Free copies of Preparing young people for a safer working life are available from IOSH, tel: 0116-257 3100, fax: 0116-257 3101. The health and safety executive's InfoLine number is: 08701 545 500.",

      "body": "<p>Heard the one about the female secretary who slept with her boss and, hey presto, she was promoted? The truth is that it's men who are more likely to sleep with their superiors to secure promotion at work, according to a new survey by online recruitment agency PlanetRecruit. </p> <p>Of the men questioned, 72% said they would have sex with their boss if it would get them a higher-status job, while less than a third of the women said they would do so. </p> <p>The survey, which reveals the lengths office workers will go to get ahead at work, also found that 62% of men said they would be happy to resort to character assassination to secure better jobs, whereas only 38% of women said they would. What's more, twice as many men as women were happy to take credit for some one else's work. This doesn't mean that women are less manipulative, however. </p> <p>Far more women than men, claims the report, are prepared to moan to win the boss's sympathy vote. \"The report shows very clearly that women feel more comfortable employing less obvious or more underhand career- enhancing tactics than men,\" says its author, Megan Hayes. \"If she's found to have done something wrong at work, she'll play the, 'Oh, but things are so hard at home' card. Or she'll keep making comments about how she's not being challenged enough in her environment, in the hope of getting a better job,\" says Hayes. </p> <p>Nevertheless, as other research shows, women are more likely than men to shoot themselves in the foot when offered the chance to prove they're ready for promotion. \"Our study found that women are far more likely than men to underrate their own performance at work. This could be one of the reasons that women find it harder than men to get promoted,\" says Haihai Yuan, co-author and researcher at Gallup Organisation. </p> <p>The chief reason that more women than men are willing to devalue themselves is because of lack of confidence in their own abilities, found the report. This comes as no surprise to Debra Allcock, author of High Flying, who trains women to be more assertive at all levels of organisations. \"Typically, they tend to measure themselves in terms of what they cannot do, rather than what they can. As a result, they think that they are less deserving - not necessarily than men are, but than any other employee.\" </p> <p>It doesn't help that women are more likely than men to take criticism as a sign that they're inadequate, says Anne Dickson, author of Women At Work. \"The stereotypical accusation that women cannot handle criticism at work and take it too personally is partly true,\" she says. \"The ability to respond to criticism without being wounded is easily undermined by our need for approval.\" </p> <p>Whether secretaries are male or female, there's a growing body of advice on the best ways to ensure promotion. Exposure - showing the right people how hard you are working - and networking are increasingly crucial, says Beverley Stone, a corporate psychologist. \"It's about letting the right people know what you are doing, what your plans are and that you're doing well,\" she says. \"After all, in today's office, there are more managers than ever who have a say in promoting secretaries.\" </p> <p>Fiona Elsa, specialist in training and development at Ashridge Management College, believes that it's worth asking as early as possible if a promotion route is mapped out for you. \"If so, ask to see your development plan. If not, ask how else you can best move up the ladder. It will show your employer that you're keen to give your best to the company.\" </p> <p>The best time to ask about promotion is at your annual performance appraisal. Max A Eggert, an appraisal specialist, says secretarial staff are at a particular advantage when it comes to getting the best from appraisals. \"Most occur annually,\" he says.</p> <p>\"But throughout the year, there should really be 'one-to-one's', which are essentially mini appraisals, ensuring that no progress is missed. Since secretaries are usually in charge of their manager's diary, they can just book in a half-hour slot once a month or so.\" <br> If you're turned down for what you think is a deserved promotion, always ask why. Ask, too, what you can do to improve your chances next time round. If the improvements mean training is required, suggest a date to start it.

      "bodyText": "Heard the one about the female secretary who slept with her boss and, hey presto, she was promoted? The truth is that it's men who are more likely to sleep with their superiors to secure promotion at work, according to a new survey by online recruitment agency PlanetRecruit. Of the men questioned, 72% said they would have sex with their boss if it would get them a higher-status job, while less than a third of the women said they would do so. The survey, which reveals the lengths office workers will go to get ahead at work, also found that 62% of men said they would be happy to resort to character assassination to secure better jobs, whereas only 38% of women said they would. What's more, twice as many men as women were happy to take credit for some one else's work. This doesn't mean that women are less manipulative, however. Far more women than men, claims the report, are prepared to moan to win the boss's sympathy vote. \"The report shows very clearly that women feel more comfortable employing less obvious or more underhand career- enhancing tactics than men,\" says its author, Megan Hayes. \"If she's found to have done something wrong at work, she'll play the, 'Oh, but things are so hard at home' card. Or she'll keep making comments about how she's not being challenged enough in her environment, in the hope of getting a better job,\" says Hayes. Nevertheless, as other research shows, women are more likely than men to shoot themselves in the foot when offered the chance to prove they're ready for promotion. \"Our study found that women are far more likely than men to underrate their own performance at work. This could be one of the reasons that women find it harder than men to get promoted,\" says Haihai Yuan, co-author and researcher at Gallup Organisation. The chief reason that more women than men are willing to devalue themselves is because of lack of confidence in their own abilities, found the report. This comes as no surprise to Debra Allcock, author of High Flying, who trains women to be more assertive at all levels of organisations. \"Typically, they tend to measure themselves in terms of what they cannot do, rather than what they can. As a result, they think that they are less deserving - not necessarily than men are, but than any other employee.\" It doesn't help that women are more likely than men to take criticism as a sign that they're inadequate, says Anne Dickson, author of Women At Work. \"The stereotypical accusation that women cannot handle criticism at work and take it too personally is partly true,\" she says. \"The ability to respond to criticism without being wounded is easily undermined by our need for approval.\" Whether secretaries are male or female, there's a growing body of advice on the best ways to ensure promotion. Exposure - showing the right people how hard you are working - and networking are increasingly crucial, says Beverley Stone, a corporate psychologist. \"It's about letting the right people know what you are doing, what your plans are and that you're doing well,\" she says. \"After all, in today's office, there are more managers than ever who have a say in promoting secretaries.\" Fiona Elsa, specialist in training and development at Ashridge Management College, believes that it's worth asking as early as possible if a promotion route is mapped out for you. \"If so, ask to see your development plan. If not, ask how else you can best move up the ladder. It will show your employer that you're keen to give your best to the company.\" The best time to ask about promotion is at your annual performance appraisal. Max A Eggert, an appraisal specialist, says secretarial staff are at a particular advantage when it comes to getting the best from appraisals. \"Most occur annually,\" he says. \"But throughout the year, there should really be 'one-to-one's', which are essentially mini appraisals, ensuring that no progress is missed. Since secretaries are usually in charge of their manager's diary, they can just book in a half-hour slot once a month or so.\" If you're turned down for what you think is a deserved promotion, always ask why. Ask, too, what you can do to improve your chances next time round. If the improvements mean training is required, suggest a date to start it. No ambitious secretary will hang around in a post where there's no chance of development - and your employers will know that.",

No doubt you will live until the next Ice Age, but you will never know the delights of a Four Cheese pizza with extra pepperoni - therefore your long, long existence will be but a meaningless sham. </p> <p>All this rampant illness had a strange effect on the office. Phone calls were abruptly curtailed by one participant or the other needing to dash to the loo. Colleagues edged around one another, wary of being on the receiving end of a bout of projectile vomiting. By mid-afternoon, half the office had admitted defeat and gone home to the privacy of their own bathrooms. And then it was upon me: cold sweat, shakes, churning stomach - the lot. </p> <p>Seeing your own lunch for the second time in one day holds limited pleasure, but as I headed home three hours early, I was at least comforted by the thought of Sara left in the office, in perfect health, with only her steamed brown rice and four people's work for company.</p>",

It seems that the cafe down the road, as well as being the conveniently located provider of bacon butties and all-day breakfast fry-ups, is also a breeding ground for a bewildering range of organisms, simply biding their time before they strike with devastating effect. As Chloe, Lyndsey and Mark fought it out over access to the toilet bowl, New Girl Sara decided that now was an appropriate moment to inform those of us not yet doubled up with abdominal pain about the delights of a macrobiotic vegan diet. Again, Sara, you mistake us for people who care. No doubt you will live until the next Ice Age, but you will never know the delights of a Four Cheese pizza with extra pepperoni - therefore your long, long existence will be but a meaningless sham. All this rampant illness had a strange effect on the office. Phone calls were abruptly curtailed by one participant or the other needing to dash to the loo. Colleagues edged around one another, wary of being on the receiving end of a bout of projectile vomiting. By mid-afternoon, half the office had admitted defeat and gone home to the privacy of their own bathrooms. And then it was upon me: cold sweat, shakes, churning stomach - the lot. Seeing your own lunch for the second time in one day holds limited pleasure, but as I headed home three hours early, I was at least comforted by the thought of Sara left in the office, in perfect health, with only her steamed brown rice and four people's work for company.",

      "byline": "Harriet Lane",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>How things change. A few years ago, Denise Van Outen was quoted as saying: 'You'll never hear me say theatre is my first love - bingo is.' But she strikes a rather different pose today. 'Now I just think, \"God, how weird. I just suddenly don't like bingo any more.\"' Denise favours turn-ups, as you can see, and there's a fair chance that hers are full of earth. Where Anna Friel and Martine McCutcheon and Dannii Minogue have gone before, Denise is hoping to follow, tunnelling out of the trash telly ghetto and into the West End. In April, she will be taking over one of the main roles in Chicago, a musical which owes equal amounts to Bob Fosse spectaculars and Ann Summers lingerie parties. </p> <p>It's not really such a surprise. Denise sent herself to Sylvia Young's, a north London stage school famous for churning out a particular brand of precocious, streetwise talent (most of All Saints, Baby Spice and the aforementioned Martine), and used to startle Johnny Vaughan with the occasional spontaneous tap routine when they co-hosted The Big Breakfast. </p> <p>A blonde with a filthy mouth and, she would have you believe, a filthier mind, Denise may be best known for her lairy antics on breakfast telly and the shortlived people show, Something For the Weekend (not quite as subtle as its euphemistic title), but she gives every impression of being supremely confident about making the switch to theatre. After all, she did stints in Stop the World: I Want To Get Off and A Midsummer Night's Dream with the RSC. Never mind that this was back in 1989. When she was 14. </p> <p>'It's not really scary; I just know that I'm going to have to work hard again. Much as I loved doing The Big Breakfast, it almost became automatic. I need something to keep my brain ticking over, something that I have to concentrate on.' </p> <p>Is it really that simple? No anxieties at all? Denise looks at me, her eyes dark and shiny as boot buttons in what is a pretty, tough little face. In the artificial light of the subterranean, windowless Royal Room at the Adelphi Theatre, the faint shadows under her eyes only slightly undermine the boldness of her words. 'Well, I'm determined to make it work. I've had training so it's not like I've never danced before and I can't sing. I know I can do those things; it's just a case of working hard to make sure that they're up to scratch.' At first glance, the omens are promising. When I admire her purple snakeskin boots from Gina, with dizzying five-inch heels, she tells me that she danced in them for her audition. </p> <p>The character she plays in Chicago is 'ballsy - I'm a little bit like that myself'. She has just finished filming a comedy drama, Nightmare Neighbour, for the BBC and she tells me that yesterday, on the final day, the director made a confession. He said that when the show was being cast, someone had said: 'What we need for this part is someone like Denise Van Outen', and then he had said: 'Oh no, because she's known as being a TV presenter.' But someone else had a feeling that Denise could act, so they called her up anyway, without thinking too much about it, and to everyone's surprise (except, you sense, her own) she got the job. </p> <p>'That is very much the mentality of people in this business and this industry,' sighs Denise. 'Everybody thinks if you do one thing, you can't do something else. So I like the fact that I can be versatile if I want to.' The fact remains that in the BBC thing, as in Chicago, and indeed everything else on her CV (the sitcom Babes in the Wood, films such as Love, Honour and Obey), she hasn't been called upon to be versatile - she has simply been called on to play the knowing saucepot, the shrewd, up-for-it dollybird. Again and again and again. </p> <p>'With a lot of the parts I've played, the characters are quite similar to me, but these parts are always more challenging,' says Denise, coming off auto-pilot to add, disarmingly, 'although you wouldn't think it. But with this, I'm obviously playing an American as well, and you've got to be able to do it singing, you've got to be able to dance.' </p> <p>Wouldn't she just kill to play a librarian or a pottery teacher? Wouldn't she rather, just for a change, do specs rather than sex? </p> <p>'Yes, that will come later,' she pronounces, sounding rather biblical, and changes the subject very quickly. I change it back. Can she imagine a time when she'll want to play someone completely different? </p> <p>'Yes, I will want to. But this is already taking it to the next stage, because I'm trying to come away from that flirty, bubbly TV blonde. I mean, this is very different. I'm not changing to the point where suddenly I wear floor-length skirts and start playing the violin; I'm just growing up a little bit, I guess.' </p> <p>However, Denise is not turning her back on the 'bubbly blonde thing', because she is currently talking to a production company about a new television show later this year, 'and I can't help how I am on TV; it's just an exaggerated version of me. I don't think I'll ever escape that, but I want to show that I can do other things. Which I can.' </p> <p>Screen Denise has often been rather useful to the real Denise, as you can tell from her press cuttings. It was Screen Denise who nicked an ashtray from a royal reception for 'young achievers', and then returned it, with an apologetic note and a Tunisian camel toy, to Buckingham Palace. It was Screen Denise who flashed her bra at Prince Charles's back during a charity pop concert, and told reporters that she'd only done it to make the pop group Steps laugh at an inappropriate moment. </p> <p>And then there was her interview technique. In the past, whether she was talking to the Mirror or the Times, you could bet that Denise would talk about farts, or make much of her bosoms, cupping them judiciously and guessing their weight, and saying things like: 'I do like my breasts. They're great, so much fun. You can do what you like with them.' </p> <p> Today, they are in purdah beneath a high-necked, hibiscus-pink jersey and do not enter the conversation once, evidence indeed of the New Mature Denise. (In fact, Denise is is so keen to act her age that occasionally she gets ahead of herself. 'I'm 27,' she volunteers at one point. I query this, as I am fairly sure she is 26 and will be until the end of May. 'Well, I'm 27 soon. But I love growing up, I think it's really exciting.') </p> <p>There's little doubt that in the past, Denise's bosoms always hijacked interviews, commanding the attention she has always craved and, simultaneously, robbing the situation of any seriousness whatsoever. In the old days, if the decoy breasts were in evidence (her production company is called Whack 'Em Out), she never had to bother with giving sensible answers. Denise does seem rather struck when I ask her if this was a deliberate policy. 'I suppose... yeah, you're right. I did kind of... they didn't... nobody ever got to see the real me.' </p> <p>But Denise is still far too canny an operator really to give herself away. This is the first one-to-one interview she has given since breaking up with her musician boyfriend of three years, Jay Kay of Jamiroquai, and the tabloids have many unanswered questions. To me, she trots out the usual lines - incompatible work schedules, gradually drifted apart, still good friends - but there is an interesting moment a little later when Denise is talking about how unmoved she felt by all the programme proposals that came her way after she left The Big Breakfast in January. </p> <p>'It was all very much the same old thing that I'd done before - late-night Friday night, for that post-pub crowd. There was nothing there that excited me. I've had my fun with that but to be honest with you, it's not shocking any more; there's nowhere to go with it. I am always very good at seeing that, in anything in my life. If it's not going to go another stage and excite me, then I move on.' </p> <p>The other thing Denise was always happy to talk about in interviews, apart from boobs and flatulence, was her boundless enthusiasm for marriage. Whenever she spoke to a tabloid, she would always confide (proof of her stainless-steel nerves) that she was gagging for Jay to pop the question. </p> <p>'I don't regret being open, but sometimes I should keep my mouth shut,' she says now. 'I don't know what's wrong with me. I am quite open and the way I see it is that if my eyes light up, I might as well just say, yes, I can't wait to get married. But unfortunately, you only have to say that and then it's all blown up out of proportion.' </p> <p>In the end, of course, Jay Kay did propose, but Denise never moved out of her bachelor-girl flat in Islington, and it wasn't long before stories about postponed weddings started doing the rounds. Denise explains that they 'officially' split five weeks ago (though they decided to call it quits way back in January), a few days after her arrival at the Brits with one handcuff locked around her wrist, the other provocatively empty. Denise regrets that very much; she wasn't intending to send out any message, and the handcuffs were part of a fearfully complicated-sounding belt with 'killer' spelled out on it in studs. </p> <p>'I mean, it was just stupid of me. It was one of those moments when you've had a glass of champagne and you don't really think.' </p> <p>So yes, she has learned from the experience, though she wants to point out that, contrary to popular belief, she and Jay never exploited their relationship to boost their profiles. She says, and I can hardly believe this, that the last time they were photographed together at a party was actually last April. But Denise says she learnt that particular lesson a very long time ago, at 14, when she had a small part in Anthony Newley's Stop the World: I Want to Get Off (Newley himself was forever plundering his private life for professional inspiration). 'I am totally aware; I didn't go into the business with my eyes shut. I grew up working on productions with people who had been successful and well known, and I became very aware of how easy it is to lose everything to the public. I wouldn't do that. There were some things sometimes with Anthony Newley, things that he would be very upset about. You can give too much away.' </p> <p>At these moments, it's worth remembering that Denise has two decades' worth of experience. Her father is a security guard, her mother a child carer, her sister a PA and her brother a hairdresser, but Denise, the youngest, was always a bit of a cuckoo, a terrible show-off, sewing costumes and putting on shows for the neighbours, using the patio doors at home in Basildon as a proscenium arch. At seven, she started modelling for knitting patterns; all her own idea, she just liked the idea of making a bit of cash. Five hopefuls would be called for a look-see, and, like Cinderella, the one who fitted the clothes got the job. Denise was the only one to realise that if a dress didn't fit, she could help things along a bit. 'I'd hold the skirt so that it looked like it fitted me. Because I thought: yeah, \u00a370 in the bank, ker-ching.' </p> <p>Her copper-bottomed self-belief, she's sure, is a result of the way she was brought up. Her mum, who was raised in the East End, had always been impressed by the confidence of her Jewish friends, and decided to try to instill the same thing in her youngest, most extrovert child. </p> <p>'If they tried to do anything, achieve anything, and it didn't work out, their parents would say to them, \"You didn't get it because you're too good.\" So my mum did it as a bit of an experiment with me. If I went to a local dance school and I didn't get the part, my mum would say to me, \"It's because you outshone everybody else.\" And I did really believe her. I mean, if I had a child like that, I'd be going, \"Stop it!\"' </p> <p>She doubles back to the balmy knitting-pattern days, explaining that if she shot her mouth off about doing a swimsuit shoot for Kay's catalogue, the kids on her street used to trip her up deliberately, knowing that if she was bruised she would lose the job. </p> <p>'So that in the end, I'd almost not say anything. I'd just say, \"Oh I didn't really get that one\" and they'd leave me alone.' Smart old Denise. She's not half as gobby as she seems. </p> <p> Denise Van Outen opens in Chicago on 17 April at the Adelphi, London WC2</p>",

      "bodyText": "How things change. A few years ago, Denise Van Outen was quoted as saying: 'You'll never hear me say theatre is my first love - bingo is.' But she strikes a rather different pose today. 'Now I just think, \"God, how weird. I just suddenly don't like bingo any more.\"' Denise favours turn-ups, as you can see, and there's a fair chance that hers are full of earth. Where Anna Friel and Martine McCutcheon and Dannii Minogue have gone before, Denise is hoping to follow, tunnelling out of the trash telly ghetto and into the West End. In April, she will be taking over one of the main roles in Chicago, a musical which owes equal amounts to Bob Fosse spectaculars and Ann Summers lingerie parties. It's not really such a surprise. Denise sent herself to Sylvia Young's, a north London stage school famous for churning out a particular brand of precocious, streetwise talent (most of All Saints, Baby Spice and the aforementioned Martine), and used to startle Johnny Vaughan with the occasional spontaneous tap routine when they co-hosted The Big Breakfast. A blonde with a filthy mouth and, she would have you believe, a filthier mind, Denise may be best known for her lairy antics on breakfast telly and the shortlived people show, Something For the Weekend (not quite as subtle as its euphemistic title), but she gives every impression of being supremely confident about making the switch to theatre. After all, she did stints in Stop the World: I Want To Get Off and A Midsummer Night's Dream with the RSC. Never mind that this was back in 1989. When she was 14. 'It's not really scary; I just know that I'm going to have to work hard again. Much as I loved doing The Big Breakfast, it almost became automatic. I need something to keep my brain ticking over, something that I have to concentrate on.' Is it really that simple? No anxieties at all? Denise looks at me, her eyes dark and shiny as boot buttons in what is a pretty, tough little face. In the artificial light of the subterranean, windowless Royal Room at the Adelphi Theatre, the faint shadows under her eyes only slightly undermine the boldness of her words. 'Well, I'm determined to make it work. I've had training so it's not like I've never danced before and I can't sing. I know I can do those things; it's just a case of working hard to make sure that they're up to scratch.' At first glance, the omens are promising. When I admire her purple snakeskin boots from Gina, with dizzying five-inch heels, she tells me that she danced in them for her audition. The character she plays in Chicago is 'ballsy - I'm a little bit like that myself'. She has just finished filming a comedy drama, Nightmare Neighbour, for the BBC and she tells me that yesterday, on the final day, the director made a confession. He said that when the show was being cast, someone had said: 'What we need for this part is someone like Denise Van Outen', and then he had said: 'Oh no, because she's known as being a TV presenter.' But someone else had a feeling that Denise could act, so they called her up anyway, without thinking too much about it, and to everyone's surprise (except, you sense, her own) she got the job. 'That is very much the mentality of people in this business and this industry,' sighs Denise. 'Everybody thinks if you do one thing, you can't do something else. So I like the fact that I can be versatile if I want to.' The fact remains that in the BBC thing, as in Chicago, and indeed everything else on her CV (the sitcom Babes in the Wood, films such as Love, Honour and Obey), she hasn't been called upon to be versatile - she has simply been called on to play the knowing saucepot, the shrewd, up-for-it dollybird. Again and again and again. 'With a lot of the parts I've played, the characters are quite similar to me, but these parts are always more challenging,' says Denise, coming off auto-pilot to add, disarmingly, 'although you wouldn't think it. But with this, I'm obviously playing an American as well, and you've got to be able to do it singing, you've got to be able to dance.' Wouldn't she just kill to play a librarian or a pottery teacher? Wouldn't she rather, just for a change, do specs rather than sex? 'Yes, that will come later,' she pronounces, sounding rather biblical, and changes the subject very quickly. I change it back. Can she imagine a time when she'll want to play someone completely different? 'Yes, I will want to. But this is already taking it to the next stage, because I'm trying to come away from that flirty, bubbly TV blonde. I mean, this is very different. I'm not changing to the point where suddenly I wear floor-length skirts and start playing the violin; I'm just growing up a little bit, I guess.' However, Denise is not turning her back on the 'bubbly blonde thing', because she is currently talking to a production company about a new television show later this year, 'and I can't help how I am on TV; it's just an exaggerated version of me. I don't think I'll ever escape that, but I want to show that I can do other things. Which I can.' Screen Denise has often been rather useful to the real Denise, as you can tell from her press cuttings. It was Screen Denise who nicked an ashtray from a royal reception for 'young achievers', and then returned it, with an apologetic note and a Tunisian camel toy, to Buckingham Palace. It was Screen Denise who flashed her bra at Prince Charles's back during a charity pop concert, and told reporters that she'd only done it to make the pop group Steps laugh at an inappropriate moment. And then there was her interview technique. In the past, whether she was talking to the Mirror or the Times, you could bet that Denise would talk about farts, or make much of her bosoms, cupping them judiciously and guessing their weight, and saying things like: 'I do like my breasts. They're great, so much fun. You can do what you like with them.' Today, they are in purdah beneath a high-necked, hibiscus-pink jersey and do not enter the conversation once, evidence indeed of the New Mature Denise. (In fact, Denise is is so keen to act her age that occasionally she gets ahead of herself. 'I'm 27,' she volunteers at one point. I query this, as I am fairly sure she is 26 and will be until the end of May. 'Well, I'm 27 soon. But I love growing up, I think it's really exciting.') There's little doubt that in the past, Denise's bosoms always hijacked interviews, commanding the attention she has always craved and, simultaneously, robbing the situation of any seriousness whatsoever. In the old days, if the decoy breasts were in evidence (her production company is called Whack 'Em Out), she never had to bother with giving sensible answers. Denise does seem rather struck when I ask her if this was a deliberate policy. 'I suppose... yeah, you're right. I did kind of... they didn't... nobody ever got to see the real me.' But Denise is still far too canny an operator really to give herself away. This is the first one-to-one interview she has given since breaking up with her musician boyfriend of three years, Jay Kay of Jamiroquai, and the tabloids have many unanswered questions. To me, she trots out the usual lines - incompatible work schedules, gradually drifted apart, still good friends - but there is an interesting moment a little later when Denise is talking about how unmoved she felt by all the programme proposals that came her way after she left The Big Breakfast in January. 'It was all very much the same old thing that I'd done before - late-night Friday night, for that post-pub crowd. There was nothing there that excited me. I've had my fun with that but to be honest with you, it's not shocking any more; there's nowhere to go with it. I am always very good at seeing that, in anything in my life. If it's not going to go another stage and excite me, then I move on.' The other thing Denise was always happy to talk about in interviews, apart from boobs and flatulence, was her boundless enthusiasm for marriage. Whenever she spoke to a tabloid, she would always confide (proof of her stainless-steel nerves) that she was gagging for Jay to pop the question. 'I don't regret being open, but sometimes I should keep my mouth shut,' she says now. 'I don't know what's wrong with me. I am quite open and the way I see it is that if my eyes light up, I might as well just say, yes, I can't wait to get married. But unfortunately, you only have to say that and then it's all blown up out of proportion.' In the end, of course, Jay Kay did propose, but Denise never moved out of her bachelor-girl flat in Islington, and it wasn't long before stories about postponed weddings started doing the rounds. Denise explains that they 'officially' split five weeks ago (though they decided to call it quits way back in January), a few days after her arrival at the Brits with one handcuff locked around her wrist, the other provocatively empty. Denise regrets that very much; she wasn't intending to send out any message, and the handcuffs were part of a fearfully complicated-sounding belt with 'killer' spelled out on it in studs. 'I mean, it was just stupid of me. It was one of those moments when you've had a glass of champagne and you don't really think.' So yes, she has learned from the experience, though she wants to point out that, contrary to popular belief, she and Jay never exploited their relationship to boost their profiles. She says, and I can hardly believe this, that the last time they were photographed together at a party was actually last April. But Denise says she learnt that particular lesson a very long time ago, at 14, when she had a small part in Anthony Newley's Stop the World: I Want to Get Off (Newley himself was forever plundering his private life for professional inspiration). 'I am totally aware; I didn't go into the business with my eyes shut. I grew up working on productions with people who had been successful and well known, and I became very aware of how easy it is to lose everything to the public. I wouldn't do that. There were some things sometimes with Anthony Newley, things that he would be very upset about. You can give too much away.' At these moments, it's worth remembering that Denise has two decades' worth of experience. Her father is a security guard, her mother a child carer, her sister a PA and her brother a hairdresser, but Denise, the youngest, was always a bit of a cuckoo, a terrible show-off, sewing costumes and putting on shows for the neighbours, using the patio doors at home in Basildon as a proscenium arch. At seven, she started modelling for knitting patterns; all her own idea, she just liked the idea of making a bit of cash. Five hopefuls would be called for a look-see, and, like Cinderella, the one who fitted the clothes got the job. Denise was the only one to realise that if a dress didn't fit, she could help things along a bit. 'I'd hold the skirt so that it looked like it fitted me. Because I thought: yeah, \u00a370 in the bank, ker-ching.' Her copper-bottomed self-belief, she's sure, is a result of the way she was brought up. Her mum, who was raised in the East End, had always been impressed by the confidence of her Jewish friends, and decided to try to instill the same thing in her youngest, most extrovert child. 'If they tried to do anything, achieve anything, and it didn't work out, their parents would say to them, \"You didn't get it because you're too good.\" So my mum did it as a bit of an experiment with me. If I went to a local dance school and I didn't get the part, my mum would say to me, \"It's because you outshone everybody else.\" And I did really believe her. I mean, if I had a child like that, I'd be going, \"Stop it!\"' She doubles back to the balmy knitting-pattern days, explaining that if she shot her mouth off about doing a swimsuit shoot for Kay's catalogue, the kids on her street used to trip her up deliberately, knowing that if she was bruised she would lose the job. 'So that in the end, I'd almost not say anything. I'd just say, \"Oh I didn't really get that one\" and they'd leave me alone.' Smart old Denise. She's not half as gobby as she seems.

Places like Poitiers, Murcia, Gerona, Esbjerg, Pescara and Gothenburg have suddenly popped up on airline summer schedules alongside old favourites such as Paris and Barcelona. But where are these newcomers - and why on earth would you want to visit them when the museums of Madrid or the restaurants of Rome (also featured by low-cost airlines) are beckoning you for the same price? </p> <p>For a start, isn't it a bit pass\u00e9 to spend the weekend somewhere too well-trodden, too well-known? And wouldn't it be fun to hit a beach for the weekend rather than a city? Murcia, Nice, La Rochelle, Gerona, Pescara and Trieste are all near the sea. Poiters gets you close to the Futuroscope theme park; Cologne is perfect for a stag weekend of cheap pub crawls in civilised surroundings and Gothenburg is good if you want a weekend of seafood restaurants at their best.</p> <p>With the strong pound, cheap flights from as little as \u00a365 return and even several new routes from Bristol - which means that 'westerners' don't have to fork out for London hotels and expensive parking - what's stopping you?</p> <p><strong> 1 La Rochelle</strong><br> <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413356,00.html\">France</a>, south-west Atlantic coast. </p> <p> <strong> Airline:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.buzzaway.com/\">Buzz</a> (London Stansted) <br> <strong> Why go there?</strong> An unpretentious alternative to Nice. La Rochelle is developing a reputation as a chic and lively port city with some great beaches. The restaurant and caf\u00e9-lined old port provides plenty of opportunity for people-watching and basking in the sun, but can get rather crowded in summer. <br> <strong> How much? </strong> From \u00a370 to \u00a3340 return including taxes. <br> <strong> Top tip:</strong> Book your accommodation well in advance. There is a shortage of cheap hotels, particularly during July and August when most hotels are full before noon. </p> <p> <strong> 2 Poitiers</strong><br> <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413356,00.html\">France</a>, south-west of Paris </p> <p> <strong> Airline:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.buzzaway.com/\">Buzz</a> (London Stansted) <br> <strong> Why go there?</strong> It's worth spending a day visiting this hilltop town's Romanesque churches but Poitiers' main appeal is as a gateway to Futuroscope, the high-tech theme park 8km north of the city. <br> Futuroscope is full of gut-churning, virtual-reality rides, the park also hosts nightly laser and fireworks shows from April to August. <strong> How much? </strong> \u00a370 - \u00a3340 <br> <strong> Top tip:</strong> Futuroscope's rides are not for the faint-hearted. The park is not suitable for children younger than eight - they must also be taller than 124cm (about 4ft) for some rides. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Murcia</strong> <br><a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413543,00.html\">Spain</a>, south-east Mediterranean coast </p> <p> <strong> Airline: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.buzzaway.com/\">Buzz</a> (London Stansted) <br> <strong> Why go there?</strong> This attractive university city is a good gateway to resorts along the nearby Costa Blanca such as the fast-growing Torrevieja where a large number of Brits have holiday homes. The new service also provides competition for British Airways, which operates flights to Murcia on behalf of Barwell Leisure, the UK agent for the five-star sports and leisure Hyatt La Manga resort which is a 20-minute drive from the airport. <br> <strong> How much? </strong> \u00a3120 -\u00a3340 <br> <strong> Top tip:</strong> Buzz's lunchtime flights to Murcia may be a better bet than some UK charter flights to Alicante, the main gateway to the Costa Blanca, which often leave at night. </p> <p> <strong> 4 Gerona</strong><br> <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413543,00.html\">Spain</a>, north Catalonia </p> <p> <strong> Airline:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.buzzaway.com/\">Buzz</a> (London Stansted) <br> <strong> Why go there?</strong> More commonly associated as a gateway to the Costa Brava, this walled city is worthy of a stopover. Guidebooks lavish praise on the medieval old town's narrow streets and baroque cathedral. Avoid the night-time charter flights from the UK for which Gerona is renowned. All Buzz flights arrive before 8pm. <br> <strong> How much? </strong> \u00a3120 - \u00a3340 <br> <strong> Top tip:</strong> Combine Gerona with a city break in Barcelona, only 90-minutes away by train. </p> <p> <strong> 5 Cologne</strong><br> <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,411927,00.html\">Germany</a>, near the border with Belgium </p> <p> <strong> Airline:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.buzzaway.com/\">Buzz</a> (London Stansted) <br> <strong> Why go there?</strong> Despite Second World bombings, Cologne still retains a few quirky buildings in the old part of town, a stunning cathedral and a buzzing bar scene. The local beer, K\u00f6lsch, comes in test-tube size glasses which slip down in one gulp. Waiters flock round replacing test tubes as fast as you drink them, marking how many you have drunk on your beer mat before bringing the final bill. See how chocolate is made at the waterfront Chocolate Museum, take a trip on the Rhine and visit nearby Bonn where the bureaucrats lived before power moved to Berlin. <br> <strong> How much? </strong> \u00a370 - \u00a3340 <br> <strong> Top tip:</strong> Go to the Kaufhof department store in the centre, which has a fantastic foodhall and stock up on traditional German food such as Bavarian white sausages, pots of sweet mustard and deer salami. </p> <p> <strong> 6 Brussels </strong><br> (Charleroi airport) </p> <p> <strong> Airline:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com/\">Ryanair</a> (London Stansted) <br> <strong> Why go there?</strong> Brussels gets a bit of a bad press as a dull centre of commerce and diplomacy but it does have its own charm. You can gorge yourself on moules frites at the Rue des Bouchers near the fifteenth-century market square Grand Place and then walk it all off by exploring nearby sights. These include the Brewery Museum, where you can learn everything you ever wanted to know about beer as well as sample some. Ryanair has organised a coach to take passengers from the airport (37 miles south of Brussels) to the metro station at Maalbeek which costs \u00a33.90 one-way. The same coach will pick up passengers for the return flight. <br> <strong> How much? </strong> \u00a383 - \u00a3159 <br> <strong> Top tip:</strong> Bruges, one of the best preserved medieval cities in Europe is only an hour away by train. </p> <p> <strong> 7 Salzburg</strong><br> <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413022,00.html\">Austria</a>'s second city </p> <p> <strong> Airline:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com/\">Ryanair</a> (London Stansted) <br> <strong> Why go there?</strong> The Sound of Music has got a lot to answer for. Salzburg's setting for part of the film has spawned numerous tacky tours in the summer months. But this picturesque city still has much in its favour such as the old town, which is deservedly a Unesco World Heritage site. The cheap fares open up possibilities for skiing breaks, city breaks and lakes and mountain touring holidays in the summer months. <br> <strong> How much? </strong> \u00a383 - \u00a3259 <br> <strong> Top tip:</strong> Book skiing to the Austrian Alps now for next winter to get the lowest fares. </p> <p> <strong> 8 Esbjerg</strong> East coast of <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413067,00.html\">Denmark</a> </p> <p> <strong> Airline:</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com/\">Ryanair</a> (London Stansted) </p> <p><strong> Why go there?</strong> Esbjerg is nothing to write home about: a North Sea oil centre and Denmark's largest fishing harbour. Ryanair, therefore, is targeting the daily flights at business travellers. But the new service offers a stress-free and quicker way to get to Jutland in western Denmark for UK tourists. Currently many UK tourists going on self-drive holidays in Denmark use DFDS Seaways' ferry service between Harwich and Esbjerg which takes 22 hours. <br> <strong> How much? </strong> \u00a333 - \u00a3259 <br> <strong> Top tip:</strong> Take the kids for a short break to Legoland in nearby Billund. Car hire is available from Esbjerg airport. </p> <p> <strong> 9 Pescara</strong><br> Italy's Adriatic coast </p> <p> <strong> Airline: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com/\">Ryanair</a> (London Stansted) <br> <strong> Why go there?</strong> Pescara is a heavily developed beach resort and commercial centre. Its only attraction is the beach and that is nothing special. Hire a car and discover the beautiful mountain scenery and medieval towns of L'Aquila and Sulmona. The route is targeted at the UK's Italian ethnic population visiting friends and relatives in the region. <br> <strong> How much? </strong> \u00a360 - \u00a3259 <br> <strong> Top tip: </strong> Get out of Pescara as quickly as you can. </p> <p> <strong> 10 Trieste</strong><br> <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413410,00.html\">Italy</a>'s Adriatic Coast </p> <p> <strong> Airline: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com/\">Ryanair</a> (London Stansted) <br> <strong> Why go there?</strong> Situated between the Adriatic Coast and Slovenia, Trieste makes an ideal gateway to the Balkans. You can mix urban culture with nature and head for the beaches, northern ski slopes or try out the numerous forest walking tracks. Trieste itself is attractive but not big on specific tourist sights. However, the city's main museum, the Civico Museo Revoltella, houses some impressive art. <br> <strong> How much? </strong> \u00a360 - \u00a3259 <br> <strong> Top tip:</strong> Avoid August when Trieste's locals go on holiday and many restaurants and hotels close down </p> <p> <strong> 11 Stockholm </strong><br> (V\u00e4ster s airport) </p> <p> <strong> Airline:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com/\">Ryanair</a> (London Stansted) <br> <strong> Why go there?</strong> Chuck out your chintz and head for the interior design shops of Stockholm. This capital city, which spawned Ikea, has become one of the trendiest in Europe. Hang out with the beautiful people in the city's bars and restaurants, which spill out on to the streets in the warm summer months. If that's not enough to keep you occupied there are 26,000 islands to explore. <br> <strong> How much? </strong> \u00a344 - \u00a3259 <br> <strong> Top tip:</strong> Buy a 24-hour Stockholm Card for entry into more than 70 attractions, as well as sightseeing by boat and public transport. It costs around \u00a315.20 for adults and \u00a34.10 for kids (aged seven to 17). </p> <p> <strong> 12 Gothenburg</strong> <br>(Save airport) East coast of <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413555,00.html\">Sweden</a> </p> <p> <strong> Airline: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com/\">Ryanair</a> (London Stansted) <br> <strong> Why go there?</strong> Don't let Gothenburg's reputation as the home of Scandinavia's biggest port put you off. It's a big city but manages to maintain quite an intimate atmosphere. All the tourist sights are within walking distance of the centre, where Sweden's top attraction, the Liseberg fun park, is based. It's also becoming a mecca for foodies who go there for the seafood restaurants. The southern archipelago has some great beaches, too. Save airport is actually closer to the city (12km) than the main airport, Landvetter. A taxi costs about \u00a315 and an hourly coach service costs about \u00a32.50. <br> <strong> How much? </strong> \u00a346 - \u00a3259 <br> <strong> Top tip:</strong> Save money by buying a Gothenburg Card which allows entry to six city museums, Liseberg and boat trips and public transport. Price per day: about \u00a36.55 for adults, \u00a33.45 for those under 17.</p> <p><strong>In need of a hotel? </strong></p> <p>All the low-cost carriers offer their own online accommodation booking services covering their destinations. But the choice can be very limited. Buzz, for example, only offers a two-star hotel in La Rochelle.</p> <p>Short break specialists have also started to make hotel-only bookings. <a href=\"http://www.crestaholidays.co.uk\">Cresta</a> (0870 1610900), <a href=\"http://www.travelscene.co.uk\">Travelscene</a> (020 8424 9648) and Kirker Holidays (0207 231 3333) now offer the service for all the short break destinations they feature but do ask for a booking fee. Cresta charges \u00a330 per transaction while Travelscene charges \u00a315 per person to a maximum of \u00a330. Kirker includes transfers with hotel bookings and charges a fee of seven per cent of the total price.</p> <p>Other good bets are companies that don't charge a booking fee. <a href=\"http://www.thehoteldirectory.co.uk\">The Hotel Directory</a> (020 8770 0123) can book accommodation in more than 100 European cities including Murcia and Cologne. Go's accommodation booking company, <a href=\"http://www.hotelconnect.co.uk\">HotelConnect</a> (020 8381 2233), offers more than 600 hotels in more than 80 European cities and will go live with its own online bookable website at the beginning of May.</p> <p><strong>Twice as nice </strong></p> <p>If you've the inclination and stamina you could combine two cities in one weekend. <a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com/\">EasyJet</a> has hubs at Amsterdam and Geneva, which opens up a number of possibilities such as combining Amsterdam and Nice or Barcelona and Geneva. The flight timings tie in with this quite nicely. For example, you can fly from Luton to Amsterdam at 9.15am on Thursday, arriving at 11.25am. After two days of sightseeing and partying a 9.15am flight gets you into Nice at 11.10, just in time for lunch. You could flop out on the beach for the rest of the day or hit the chic boutiques. A late afternoon flight on Sunday gets you back to Luton at 5.55pm. </p> <p>A combination of single fares comes to around \u00a3135 plus taxes if booked over the internet.</p> <p>Other possible combinations include: Liverpool-Barcelona-Geneva-Liverpool or Luton-Nice-Geneva-Luton. </p> <p><strong>Tips for saving even more </strong></p> <p>\u0095 Save money by booking your flight over the internet rather than ringing a call centre. All the low-cost airlines offer a discount for online bookings. EasyJet, for example, offers a \u00a35 discount on its return fares. </p> <p>\u0095 If you can be flexible on dates, the cheapest flights are available between midday on Monday and midday on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u0095 The earlier you book, the lower the price will be. Go, EasyJet and Buzz currently have flights available until mid or late September. Ryanair is selling flights for departures up to January 2002.</p> <p>\u0095 Organise your hotel accommodation as soon as you buy your flight. Destinations such as Dublin, Amsterdam and Barcelona are big problem areas when it comes to finding hotels.</p> <p>\u0095 Check if the airline offers any discounted rail travel to the outbound airport. Passengers travelling with EasyJet, for example, can buy a return ticket from central London to Luton for \u00a38 if they book more than eight weeks in advance.</p> <p><strong>Getting there </strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.buzzaway.com\">Buzz</a> 0870 240 7070. <br><strong>Established routes:</strong> London Stansted to Berlin, Bordeaux, Chambery (winter only), D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Geneva (winter only), Gerona, Helsinki, Jerez, Lyons, Marseilles, Milan, Montpellier, Murcia, Paris, Toulouse and Vienna. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com\">EasyJet</a> 0870 6000 000. <br><strong>Established routes:</strong> London Luton to Aberdeen, Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Belfast International, Edinburgh, Geneva, Glasgow, Inverness, Liverpool, Madrid, Nice, Palma and Zurich.

Places like Poitiers, Murcia, Gerona, Esbjerg, Pescara and Gothenburg have suddenly popped up on airline summer schedules alongside old favourites such as Paris and Barcelona. But where are these newcomers - and why on earth would you want to visit them when the museums of Madrid or the restaurants of Rome (also featured by low-cost airlines) are beckoning you for the same price? For a start, isn't it a bit pass\u00e9 to spend the weekend somewhere too well-trodden, too well-known? And wouldn't it be fun to hit a beach for the weekend rather than a city?

Poiters gets you close to the Futuroscope theme park; Cologne is perfect for a stag weekend of cheap pub crawls in civilised surroundings and Gothenburg is good if you want a weekend of seafood restaurants at their best. With the strong pound, cheap flights from as little as \u00a365 return and even several new routes from Bristol - which means that 'westerners' don't have to fork out for London hotels and expensive parking - what's stopping you? 1 La Rochelle France, south-west Atlantic coast. Airline: Buzz (London Stansted) Why go there? An unpretentious alternative to Nice. La Rochelle is developing a reputation as a chic and lively port city with some great beaches. The restaurant and caf\u00e9-lined old port provides plenty of opportunity for people-watching and basking in the sun, but can get rather crowded in summer. How much? From \u00a370 to \u00a3340 return including taxes. Top tip: Book your accommodation well in advance. There is a shortage of cheap hotels, particularly during July and August when most hotels are full before noon. 2 Poitiers France, south-west of Paris Airline: Buzz (London Stansted) Why go there? It's worth spending a day visiting this hilltop town's Romanesque churches but Poitiers' main appeal is as a gateway to Futuroscope, the high-tech theme park 8km north of the city. Futuroscope is full of gut-churning, virtual-reality rides, the park also hosts nightly laser and fireworks shows from April to August. How much? \u00a370 - \u00a3340 Top tip: Futuroscope's rides are not for the faint-hearted. The park is not suitable for children younger than eight - they must also be taller than 124cm (about 4ft) for some rides. 3 Murcia Spain, south-east Mediterranean coast Airline: Buzz (London Stansted) Why go there? This attractive university city is a good gateway to resorts along the nearby Costa Blanca such as the fast-growing Torrevieja where a large number of Brits have holiday homes. The new service also provides competition for British Airways, which operates flights to Murcia on behalf of Barwell Leisure, the UK agent for the five-star sports and leisure Hyatt La Manga resort which is a 20-minute drive from the airport. How much? \u00a3120 -\u00a3340 Top tip: Buzz's lunchtime flights to Murcia may be a better bet than some UK charter flights to Alicante, the main gateway to the Costa Blanca, which often leave at night. 4 Gerona Spain, north Catalonia Airline: Buzz (London Stansted) Why go there? More commonly associated as a gateway to the Costa Brava, this walled city is worthy of a stopover. Guidebooks lavish praise on the medieval old town's narrow streets and baroque cathedral. Avoid the night-time charter flights from the UK for which Gerona is renowned. All Buzz flights arrive before 8pm. How much? \u00a3120 - \u00a3340 Top tip: Combine Gerona with a city break in Barcelona, only 90-minutes away by train. 5 Cologne Germany, near the border with Belgium Airline: Buzz (London Stansted) Why go there? Despite Second World bombings, Cologne still retains a few quirky buildings in the old part of town, a stunning cathedral and a buzzing bar scene. The local beer, K\u00f6lsch, comes in test-tube size glasses which slip down in one gulp. Waiters flock round replacing test tubes as fast as you drink them, marking how many you have drunk on your beer mat before bringing the final bill. See how chocolate is made at the waterfront Chocolate Museum, take a trip on the Rhine and visit nearby Bonn where the bureaucrats lived before power moved to Berlin.

How much? \u00a383 - \u00a3159 Top tip: Bruges, one of the best preserved medieval cities in Europe is only an hour away by train. 7 Salzburg Austria's second city Airline: Ryanair (London Stansted) Why go there? The Sound of Music has got a lot to answer for. Salzburg's setting for part of the film has spawned numerous tacky tours in the summer months. But this picturesque city still has much in its favour such as the old town, which is deservedly a Unesco World Heritage site. The cheap fares open up possibilities for skiing breaks, city breaks and lakes and mountain touring holidays in the summer months. How much? \u00a383 - \u00a3259 Top tip: Book skiing to the Austrian Alps now for next winter to get the lowest fares. 8 Esbjerg East coast of Denmark Airline: Ryanair (London Stansted) Why go there? Esbjerg is nothing to write home about: a North Sea oil centre and Denmark's largest fishing harbour. Ryanair, therefore, is targeting the daily flights at business travellers. But the new service offers a stress-free and quicker way to get to Jutland in western Denmark for UK tourists. Currently many UK tourists going on self-drive holidays in Denmark use DFDS Seaways' ferry service between Harwich and Esbjerg which takes 22 hours. How much? \u00a333 - \u00a3259 Top tip: Take the kids for a short break to Legoland in nearby Billund. Car hire is available from Esbjerg airport. 9 Pescara Italy's Adriatic coast Airline: Ryanair (London Stansted) Why go there? Pescara is a heavily developed beach resort and commercial centre. Its only attraction is the beach and that is nothing special. Hire a car and discover the beautiful mountain scenery and medieval towns of L'Aquila and Sulmona. The route is targeted at the UK's Italian ethnic population visiting friends and relatives in the region. How much? \u00a360 - \u00a3259 Top tip: Get out of Pescara as quickly as you can. 10 Trieste Italy's Adriatic Coast Airline: Ryanair (London Stansted) Why go there? Situated between the Adriatic Coast and Slovenia, Trieste makes an ideal gateway to the Balkans. You can mix urban culture with nature and head for the beaches, northern ski slopes or try out the numerous forest walking tracks. Trieste itself is attractive but not big on specific tourist sights. However, the city's main museum, the Civico Museo Revoltella, houses some impressive art. How much? \u00a360 - \u00a3259 Top tip: Avoid August when Trieste's locals go on holiday and many restaurants and hotels close down 11 Stockholm (V\u00e4ster s airport) Airline: Ryanair (London Stansted) Why go there? Chuck out your chintz and head for the interior design shops of Stockholm. This capital city, which spawned Ikea, has become one of the trendiest in Europe. Hang out with the beautiful people in the city's bars and restaurants, which spill out on to the streets in the warm summer months. If that's not enough to keep you occupied there are 26,000 islands to explore. How much? \u00a344 - \u00a3259 Top tip: Buy a 24-hour Stockholm Card for entry into more than 70 attractions, as well as sightseeing by boat and public transport. It costs around \u00a315.20 for adults and \u00a34.10 for kids (aged seven to 17). 12 Gothenburg (Save airport) East coast of Sweden Airline: Ryanair (London Stansted) Why go there? Don't let Gothenburg's reputation as the home of Scandinavia's biggest port put you off. It's a big city but manages to maintain quite an intimate atmosphere. All the tourist sights are within walking distance of the centre, where Sweden's top attraction, the Liseberg fun park, is based.

A late afternoon flight on Sunday gets you back to Luton at 5.55pm. A combination of single fares comes to around \u00a3135 plus taxes if booked over the internet. Other possible combinations include: Liverpool-Barcelona-Geneva-Liverpool or Luton-Nice-Geneva-Luton. Tips for saving even more \u0095 Save money by booking your flight over the internet rather than ringing a call centre. All the low-cost airlines offer a discount for online bookings. EasyJet, for example, offers a \u00a35 discount on its return fares. \u0095 If you can be flexible on dates, the cheapest flights are available between midday on Monday and midday on Wednesday. \u0095 The earlier you book, the lower the price will be. Go, EasyJet and Buzz currently have flights available until mid or late September. Ryanair is selling flights for departures up to January 2002. \u0095 Organise your hotel accommodation as soon as you buy your flight. Destinations such as Dublin, Amsterdam and Barcelona are big problem areas when it comes to finding hotels. \u0095 Check if the airline offers any discounted rail travel to the outbound airport. Passengers travelling with EasyJet, for example, can buy a return ticket from central London to Luton for \u00a38 if they book more than eight weeks in advance. Getting there Buzz 0870 240 7070. Established routes: London Stansted to Berlin, Bordeaux, Chambery (winter only), D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Geneva (winter only), Gerona, Helsinki, Jerez, Lyons, Marseilles, Milan, Montpellier, Murcia, Paris, Toulouse and Vienna.

      "body": "<p>When I was 18 I travelled in Indonesia. Returning home I held the inevitable slideshow for long-suffering friends. There was a shot of an old farmer. He was as sinewy as a Balinese carving. He stands, unsmiling, holding on to some willowy branches, as if he has indeed been hewn from the tree. 'Don't you mind taking pictures of people?' asked a friend. I thought it a strange question. </p> <p>There was a perfect picture opportunity and I made the most of it. I didn't speak Indonesian and I had to physically position him for my desired pose. He didn't seem to mind. I got my photo and perhaps he felt flattered. I said thank you. </p> <p>When I think about it now, I cringe - how I felt I had the right to control someone, just to get a photo. But it's something you see everywhere: the abuse of the power of the camera. </p> <p>The issue has been in the news recently. Teirney Gearon's pictures of her naked children at the Saatchi Gallery provoked accusations of pornography. And when Lord Healey exhibited a picture he had taken of a half-dressed boy in Beijing, the debate widened to examine the ethics of travel photography, and the limits of acceptable behaviour in seeking a particular shot. </p> <p>Taking holiday snaps of people is not necessarily wrong; it's whether the process is intrusive. Should you ask permission or candidly use a zoom? What about the sticky issue of payment? There's rarely a correct answer. Different cultures, classes, religions, sexes and age groups will have varied opinions, even in the same country. Your age, sex, culture and attitude will make a difference, too. In some countries, notably Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, photographing people may be viewed as evil; in others, people earn a living from posing for tourists. </p> <p>Near Bombay (Mumbai) there are historic caves which are a popular day-trip destination. Climbing several hundred steps, you are assaulted by trinket sellers, caf\u00e9 owners, monkeys and, most bizarrely, village women with empty metal water-pots on their heads. They run ahead of you to pose stiffly and insist that you take a picture. Then they ask for money. These women know what tourists want: an 'authentic' look. No plastic water containers please. Even their new metal ones have been deliberately dented to give a time-worn appearance. Inevitably, pictures of them, staged and rushed as they eye up other passing tourists, look awful. </p> <p>While some argue that paying people for their pictures is demeaning and exploitative, what should never be disputed is the common courtesy of asking permission for close-up pictures. If the person says no, respect their wish and go without the picture. If they say yes, it does mean you may have sacrificed candidness, but spying on people with long lenses is tacky and, sometimes, risky. Whipping out a camera in someone's surprised face is even worse. </p> <p>For general street scenes it's a different story. It's impossible to ask permission, but if you position yourself - without hiding - and wait for picture 'opportunities' to come along, you can at least reassure yourself that people had the option of avoiding you. But when there's a whole group of tourists doing this, as I saw recently in Cape Town's picturesque Bo Kaap district, residents must feel like ducks trying to escape a shooting party. </p> <p>It helps to strike up some kind of rapport with people before talking about close-ups. In developing countries especially, this is easier if the person is the same sex as yourself and, sometimes, if they are of a similar age or younger. Engage in some non-photo graphic banter. Then ask permission, explaining why you want to take a picture. If the answer is a genuine yes (rather than resignation), keep talking as you photograph. Explain what you're doing. Joke, laugh, direct politely and keep taking pictures as the person relaxes and carries on with the activity that caught your eye initially. If you can't speak the language, an interpreter is invaluable. If the person you've been photographing is selling goods be gracious and buy something and, if you had negotiated it initially, pay a fee. </p> <p>It is during such close-up shoots that I admit I can be duplicitous. With a wide-angle lens, you can photograph people who do not realise they are in the frame. Yet unlike spying from afar, they are usually aware of the picture-taking. Their observation often makes the picture. </p> <p>It is always appreciated if you can also take an instant picture to give to your main 'subject'. An instant photograph is an excellent way to thank people. You will probably find that everyone else in the place will want pictures taken too. </p> <p>More radically, you could consider not taking pictures at all. Leave the camera behind. It is a liberating experience, and, while mental images may not last as long as prints, they are much more vivid during the taking. If you can't bear to be without photos, ask others to take them. </p> <p>If you befriend your hosts, you could ask if they would like to take part in a simplified photographic 'project'. You and your hosts will end up with pictures that they have taken. I did a full-scale version of this with children in the Solomon Islands for Save the Children. It entails giving disposable cameras to volunteers to take their own pictures. You may have to explain the technicalities of photography, and brief participants about possible subject matter, for example, 'a day in their life'. You then develop the films and give prints to the participants and - having explained in advance - keep a duplicate set for yourself. You will have a unique perspective on your hosts' environment: their own 'photo-voice'. </p> <p>If you haven't got time for such an ambitious venture, then asking permission, being respectful and friendly, paying a fee when asked and giving an instant picture, all pave the way to good people photography. </p> <p>Handled in the right way, photography doesn't need to be an abuse of power or something which distances you from the local people: it can provide a valuable insight and an excuse for interaction. </p> <p>\u0095 Paul Miles won the Tourism Council of the South Pacific/Kodak Award for Excellence 1997.

Book a cheap package that doesn't include meals and use shared taxis to get out to local restaurants or just buy spicy jerk chicken straight off the big oil drum barbecues on the streets with a can of ice-cold Red Stripe beer.

Its restaurants are more fish fingers than tapas and high chairs sometimes outnumber grown-ups' ones. The beaches are sandy and the sea is calm and turquoise blue.

Lateoffers@holidayleaders.com has one-week deals to Jamaica for \u00a3697 including flights from Manchester and accommodation at the Golden Seas Beach Resort on the beach Oracabessa, St Mary. \u0095If you like doing your own thing, get hold of a good independent guide book to check out accommodation (such as the Rough Guide to Cuba - which was this week shortlisted for best guidebook 2001 in the Oscars of travel writing, the Travelex Travel Writers' Awards) and book a flight to Cuba. Trailfinders (020 7937 5400) has returns from Heathrow to Havana (via Amsterdam on KLM) for \u00a3388 return before 6 April. Something for less than \u00a3600 \u0095 Are today's Oscars making your feet itch for California? Bon Voyage (0800 316 0194) has fly-drive holidays on direct BA flights from Gatwick to San Diego for \u00a3585 including hotels, car hire and return flights between 18 and 30 April. The beaches around San Diego are great for surfing, and playing beach dude. It's just a short hop over the border to Mexico to Tijuana if you want some hot nightlife. \u0095Yes, those really cheap deals for Dubai are cropping up again which means the scorching Middle Eastern summer is almost upon us. If you can bear the heat (between 25C and 36C degrees in June) you can snap up a sun, sea and shopping trip to Dubai for \u00a3399 including six nights at the luxury Le Meridien hotel and return flights from Gatwick. Tradewinds (0870 751 0004). Applies 1 - 30 June. \u0095 Jerusalem is back on the tourist map after the Foreign Office relaxed its advice against Britons visiting that part of Israel.

Three-night packages through Superstar Holidays (0645 125847) cost \u00a3327 including B&amp;B and flights from Stansted on departures next week.

Price includes crossing and accommodation in self-catering holiday homes and unlimited use of indoor swimming pool complex. Amsterdam Travel Service (0870 727 5916). \u0095You can't get more child-friendly than the Spanish island of Menorca . Its restaurants are more fish fingers than tapas and high chairs sometimes outnumber grown-ups' ones. The beaches are sandy and the sea is calm and turquoise blue. About the only drawback at Easter can be the weather (18C is about as hot as it gets at this time, but at least there's no chance of baby getting burnt). Owners' Syndicate (020 7801 9804) has the Villas es Pedegral in Biniparrell from \u00a3300 per person per week including flights (based on eight people sharing). Available from 5 April. \u0095 If you have a big family, holidays can be massively expensive so camping (however much you hated it in the scouts) suddenly becomes an attractive option.

      "body": "<p>I'm not terribly good at that Proustian remembrance thing. You could drop a two-tonne madeleine on my head and it wouldn't record a flicker of recognition, let alone unlock a lifetime of reflection. </p> <p>It is a standing, if somewhat bitter, joke chez Beaumont that, while my partner has a photographic recollection of our wooing, wedding and shared life, my recollections are full of dark lacunae. Still, I did have some hopes of my return to the Italian resort of Bardonecchia, where, as a rather spotty teenager, I learnt to ski on a school trip and - being at that age - got utterly hammered for the first time on local liquor. </p> <p>My memories of the resort a quarter of a century ago are not exactly complete, but I have flashes. I remember winding up a long mountain road from Turin airport. I have intimations of a particular ski run, tootling round a little narrow bend among the trees. More strongly etched is the rather rough bar where we would sneak off for a drink - the kind of place the French call zincs . What I do remember very clearly - with a twinge of shame - is scaring the wits out of the hotel owners' toddler by coming down for dinner with a crepe bandage wrapped around my face and wearing sunglasses in some questionable homage to The Invisible Man . </p> <p>So I can't really be blamed if in the intervening period a rather nice motorway has been built all the way from the airport to the resort. Or for not finding a particular bar in a town still full of rather similar bars. And trust me, I tried. </p> <p>The reasons for going back to Bardonecchia were twofold. First, there was the personal odyssey thing. Second, the town is in the news. It is one of the centres for the 2006 Winter Olympics, bringing some much needed develop ment money to the Piedmont ski resorts.

      "bodyText": "I'm not terribly good at that Proustian remembrance thing. You could drop a two-tonne madeleine on my head and it wouldn't record a flicker of recognition, let alone unlock a lifetime of reflection. It is a standing, if somewhat bitter, joke chez Beaumont that, while my partner has a photographic recollection of our wooing, wedding and shared life, my recollections are full of dark lacunae. Still, I did have some hopes of my return to the Italian resort of Bardonecchia, where, as a rather spotty teenager, I learnt to ski on a school trip and - being at that age - got utterly hammered for the first time on local liquor. My memories of the resort a quarter of a century ago are not exactly complete, but I have flashes. I remember winding up a long mountain road from Turin airport. I have intimations of a particular ski run, tootling round a little narrow bend among the trees. More strongly etched is the rather rough bar where we would sneak off for a drink - the kind of place the French call zincs . What I do remember very clearly - with a twinge of shame - is scaring the wits out of the hotel owners' toddler by coming down for dinner with a crepe bandage wrapped around my face and wearing sunglasses in some questionable homage to The Invisible Man . So I can't really be blamed if in the intervening period a rather nice motorway has been built all the way from the airport to the resort. Or for not finding a particular bar in a town still full of rather similar bars. And trust me, I tried. The reasons for going back to Bardonecchia were twofold. First, there was the personal odyssey thing. Second, the town is in the news. It is one of the centres for the 2006 Winter Olympics, bringing some much needed develop ment money to the Piedmont ski resorts. Bardonecchia, where skiing has been going on for more than a century, will host the women's downhill races and a series of snowboard events. The Olympics may threaten to raise the profile of the resort, but Bardonecchia remains one of those places where you can ski on a budget without sacrificing the quality of the skiing. The season is shorter than elsewhere, but even at its height a week's pass comes in well short of \u00a3100.

This week the Government is expected finally to announce a ban on pigswill.</p> <p>Professor Harriet Kimbell MBE, a Seac member, said: 'One should never recycle pigs to pigs, sheep to sheep. Anything that is from the same species is a risk and should be stopped.'</p> <p>'You have to wonder why the hell we continued to bother with pigswill for so long,' said Peter Jinman, a vet and Seac member. 'The benefits cannot possibly outweigh the risks. Now we have learnt that lesson the hard way.'</p> <p>The news will add to the sense of crisis dogging the Government over the foot and mouth affair.</p> <p>Senior figures in the Labour Party are for the first time talking about a 'short pause' in plans for a general election, saying that the poll should be delayed until June.</p> <p>'When the centre, and I mean by that Downing Street, has control of the issue, then the general election can go ahead,' said one of Tony Blair's closest political friends, a very senior figure in the Labour Party. 'That will take two to three weeks, and that means there should be a short pause in the general election planning.</p> <p>'The public will not take kindly to the image of a Prime Minister breaking off focusing on the foot and mouth issue in order to launch a campaign.

      "bodyText": "Crucial scientific advice that could have averted the foot and mouth disaster was ignored by the Government for more than three years on economic grounds. The advice, which came from the Government's own panel of agriculture experts set up to deal with the BSE epidemic, would have stopped contaminated pigswill being fed to animals - thought to be the cause of the original outbreak in north-east England. But the Government rejected a ban on pigswill - the slops from airline food, restaurants and school dinners - because this would have hit farmers, who would then have had to buy expensive feed. The disclosure was seized on by opposition parties yesterday, who pointed out that such a saving had cost the economy \u00a39 billion, and called the revelation 'devastating', saying it revealed how badly the Government was handling the epidemic, which spread to nine more farms yesterday. In 1998 the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (Seac) told agriculture Ministers that they should outlaw the feeding of swill containing catering waste to pigs to prevent the transmission of diseases. The advice was ignored because the Government was concerned about the economic consequences of a ban. This week the Government is expected finally to announce a ban on pigswill. Professor Harriet Kimbell MBE, a Seac member, said: 'One should never recycle pigs to pigs, sheep to sheep. Anything that is from the same species is a risk and should be stopped.' 'You have to wonder why the hell we continued to bother with pigswill for so long,' said Peter Jinman, a vet and Seac member. 'The benefits cannot possibly outweigh the risks. Now we have learnt that lesson the hard way.' The news will add to the sense of crisis dogging the Government over the foot and mouth affair. Senior figures in the Labour Party are for the first time talking about a 'short pause' in plans for a general election, saying that the poll should be delayed until June. 'When the centre, and I mean by that Downing Street, has control of the issue, then the general election can go ahead,' said one of Tony Blair's closest political friends, a very senior figure in the Labour Party. 'That will take two to three weeks, and that means there should be a short pause in the general election planning. 'The public will not take kindly to the image of a Prime Minister breaking off focusing on the foot and mouth issue in order to launch a campaign. That should be avoided.' An autumn poll has been all but ruled out. On a tour of affected areas in Devon yesterday, Blair said the situation had been 'hellish' for the farming community, adding: 'We are doing everything we can, not only to get on top of the disease, to control and eradicate it, but to make sure that people here get not just the compensation they need but financial help they need for the future.' The number of reported cases climbed yesterday to 524, as the Government authorised a policy of automatic slaughter on any farms which shared a boundary with any infected farm - a significant widening of the cull. There is no sign that the rate of infection was slowing. The policy will affect the whole of the UK and will involve the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of sheep, cattle and pigs. New plans to control sheep movements will also be announced this week. Downing Street sources said the movement of sheep hundreds of miles across the country to market was one of the reasons the disease had spread so quickly. Cobra - the Government's national emergency management room beneath the Cabinet Office in Whitehall - has been opened for the first time since last year's fuel crisis. Jonathan Powell, the Prime Minister's chief of staff and one of his most trusted lieutenants, is to head a crisis team, in effect overruling Nick Brown, the Agriculture Minister, who has been criticised for failing to bring the crisis under control. Brown has hinted strongly that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food may start vaccinating livestock against the disease in coming days to buy time to kill animals at risk. However, he ruled out a national vaccination policy. 'There is no question of [that], but it is right just to consider if it would help our containment policies locally,' he said. Vaccination would mean an end to British meat and livestock exports, worth an annual \u00a3570 million, for anything from three months to two years. The news that Maff ignored advice that would have prevented the outbreak in the first place will further embarrass the Ministry. Maff documents reveal that Seac 'felt that recycling pig waste as feed for the same species could create the potential to spread disease and recommended that the Government should remove this risk'. The documents show that the Government agreed to 'consult on the issue of [a ban on] feeding catering waste containing pig material to pigs' - exactly what is believed to have happened at Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland, where the outbreak started. No ban was imposed. 'Pigswill is only one of a number of possible causes being considered. The Government takes a range of scientific advice in policy decisions,' a Maff spokesman said. The logistics of the cull are continuing to cause problems, with the Army helping vets. 'It's like a war,' said one vet yesterday. 'There's mud up to your knees and carcasses everywhere.'",

The move represents a dramatic new initiative in the package holiday sector, which is best known for staid family vacations. </p> <p>The company, founded by a temperance campaigner in 1841, has opened negotiations with operators providing leisure facilities in destinations all over the world, as well as in established gay holiday locations such as Sydney and Lesbos. Operators will be vetted to ensure owners of hotels, villas, ski chalets and cruise ships offer gays as warm a welcome as heterosexuals. </p> <p>'We've identified a market of two million [lesbian and gay holidaymakers] in Britain,' said Mike Beaumont, Thomas Cook's commercial director. 'We estimate that those people are already booking 120,000 package holidays every year. Mainstream retailers like ourselves have simply not done enough in the past to tap into this area. We intend to rectify that.' </p> <p>Packages are being assembled for a string of traditional gay tourist venues, including Ibiza, Mykonos, Australia and San Francisco. 'However, we're aware that a large part of the market is also looking for holiday destinations common to everyone else,' said Beaumont. 'They don't just want to go to a gay venue any more. We have a very mixed workforce ourselves, just like any large company. We want to offer a clear signal that we're catering for gay people.' </p> <p>'My partner and I want to go on holiday like everyone else,' said 44-year-old Jane Duffy, an information processor from west London. 'But there's always an anxiety when you're booking. Will they query why two women want to share a room, why we live at the same address? We booked into a Hilton hotel in Glasgow a couple of years ago and when we arrived they made a huge song and dance about our sharing a room with a double bed.' </p> <p>Tim Hughes, a 24-year-old waiter from Leeds, said: 'A group of us go to Ibiza every summer. We book through a small company which specialises in gay business but we'd be only too happy to use a high-street travel firm once they made it clear we were welcome.' </p> <p>When Thomas Cook first took a group of holidaymakers to Paris 160 years ago - after booking tickets and accommodation in bulk - the attractions on offer included an execution by guillotine. Within a decade his eponymous firm was transporting travellers to destinations as far away as Palestine. A flotilla of the firm's ships helped carry 18,000 British soldiers on their attempt to relieve General Gordon at Khartoum. </p> <p>More than a century later, the business sells holidays to 3.5 mil lion people a year. As well as its core brand, it also runs the notoriously heterosexual Club 18-30, celebrated for its raunchy holidays for young people. The expansion into the gay market is expected to be accompanied by major promotional investment in brochures, guides and internet marketing. Angela Mason, director of the gay equality campaign Stonewall, said: 'One of the most interesting things about this exercise is that it tokens the assimilation of gays and lesbians into the mainstream market. Companies are waking up to the fact that diversity is good for business.' </p> <p>'We've seen a remarkable transformation in 20 years,' said Mike McCann, a retailer who founded the Gay Business Association in 1984. 'We were dealing then mainly with the police harassment of gay- run pubs and shops. Gays were regarded as dodgy by straight businesses. Now, if we go fashion-buying in America or Europe we're greeted with open arms. People are falling over themselves to sell through the gay market.' </p> <p>Historically, little research has been done into the spending habits of lesbians and gays. The 'pink pound' has been identified as a commercial opportunity but fully exploited only in the bar, fashion and music sectors. A 1996 survey in America found that gay men had an income 41 per cent above the US national average and gay women's earnings were 26 per cent above those of their heterosexual counterparts. The cause was not only that many gay people were childless and could devote more time and energy to their careers, but that they were three times more likely than the general population to have a college degree. </p> <p>'We're aware of the children issue,' said Beaumont. 'However, our interest is more to do with the considerable size of this market sector and the number who take package holidays. We spend a huge amount of time researching segments of the market and providing services for those segments.

She declared herself the \"enemy of the old, wet Tories who think they were born to rule.\" Her 1994-95 Europhobe rebellions provoked her chief whip to want to exile her to the Falklands. In 1997 she deserted John Redwood as \"a bad-mannered, insensitive snob whose remarks on single mothers were a disaster\", dismissed William Hague as a \"Willie\" and voted for Europhile Ken Clarke. It was an example of a bright woman who \"considers every subject on its merits\", as Gerald Kaufman confirms. Typical of her independence is her rejection of accepted wisdom about global warming. As a biologist with a first class honours degree from London University, she prefers blaming sunspots. Her militant feminism made her part of the bipartisan Commons feminist sisterhood into which she was welcomed by admiring Labour and LibDem women. But she only had contempt for the docile \"New Labour\" Blair-worshipping 1997 generation of women MPs who refused to use their enhanced strength independently. Mrs Gorman, though, had always acted independently. Her low horizon family expected her to become \"a hairdresser or someone's secretary\". Instead she became a biology teacher. When she found schools could not afford microscopes, she developed teaching aids which she sold all over the world through her firm Banta. Only middle class conformist Conservative chauvinists will not miss her. Ask Aristotle about Teresa Gorman",

      "body": "<p>Spring time and the giving is easy. At least that is what UK charities are finding thanks to generous new incentives from the taxman for charitable donations. </p> <p>Relief on gifts of shares and securities to charity and changes to the Gift Aid scheme have unlocked a flood of money for charitable causes, and much more is expected to flow into their coffers over the next few weeks as higher earners seek to cut their tax liability before the end of the tax year. </p> <p>The Charities Aid Foundation, which last year distributed more than \u00a3100 million to various UK charities, hopes to see gifts of shares to good causes quadruple in size from \u00a38 million in 1999-2000 to\u00a335m this year. </p> <p>Sylvia Baig, trust manager for CAF, said clients for its CharityCard scheme, who would in previous tax years give small sums of money split between different charities, have been making average donations of \u00a35,000 in shares in 2000-01. </p> <p>'We asked them to give us at least \u00a3500 if they were donating shares, but they've given much more,' she said. </p> <p>Donations from individuals who have set up charitable trusts with CAF have also shot up. 'Quite rich people are realising they can get income tax relief as well as capital gains tax relief on a gift of shares. It has really made a difference,' Baig said. </p> <p>Donation of quoted shares and securities to charity has always meant avoidance of capital gains tax (CGT). As of this tax year, however, taxpayers can also gain relief at their marginal rate of income tax - a double boost from the Treasury. </p> <p>Here's how it works: If you are earning \u00a360,000 and were to give quoted shares valued at \u00a310,000, you would pay income tax on only \u00a350,000, reducing your tax liability by \u00a34,000.

      "bodyText": "Spring time and the giving is easy. At least that is what UK charities are finding thanks to generous new incentives from the taxman for charitable donations. Relief on gifts of shares and securities to charity and changes to the Gift Aid scheme have unlocked a flood of money for charitable causes, and much more is expected to flow into their coffers over the next few weeks as higher earners seek to cut their tax liability before the end of the tax year. The Charities Aid Foundation, which last year distributed more than \u00a3100 million to various UK charities, hopes to see gifts of shares to good causes quadruple in size from \u00a38 million in 1999-2000 to\u00a335m this year. Sylvia Baig, trust manager for CAF, said clients for its CharityCard scheme, who would in previous tax years give small sums of money split between different charities, have been making average donations of \u00a35,000 in shares in 2000-01. 'We asked them to give us at least \u00a3500 if they were donating shares, but they've given much more,' she said. Donations from individuals who have set up charitable trusts with CAF have also shot up. 'Quite rich people are realising they can get income tax relief as well as capital gains tax relief on a gift of shares. It has really made a difference,' Baig said. Donation of quoted shares and securities to charity has always meant avoidance of capital gains tax (CGT). As of this tax year, however, taxpayers can also gain relief at their marginal rate of income tax - a double boost from the Treasury. Here's how it works: If you are earning \u00a360,000 and were to give quoted shares valued at \u00a310,000, you would pay income tax on only \u00a350,000, reducing your tax liability by \u00a34,000. If the shares included a capital gain of \u00a35,000, CGT liability of \u00a32,000 is avoided. Your \u00a310,000 gift to charity effectively costs you only \u00a34,000. Hilary Browne-Wilkinson, director of the newly established Institute for Philanthropy, and a former partner at City law firm Allen and Overy, is delighted by the new tax regime. 'It's a wonderful initiative of the Government to go ahead with this and I think it will make a big difference to the amount of giving in the UK,' Browne-Wilkinson said. She says the Treasury is progressively making the tax system more liberal in a bid to encourage the kind of largesse seen in the US, where average giving per household is about five times that seen here. Stephen Burgess, charities consultant to accountant Saffery Champness, says the tax change will unlock vast sums for charity. Wealthy individuals who have exceeded their annual CGT allowance will find donating to charity extremely tax-efficient. 'If you organise it properly the value to charity can be up to five times the after-tax costs to the donor,' he said. One cancer charity seeking rich donors to fund palliative care centres had estimated that instead of targeting people with a net worth of \u00a310m, it could now target people worth \u00a35m as a result of the new tax incentives: 'There aren't that many people worth more than \u00a35m, but there are nine times more than people worth \u00a310m.' The UK shares that qualify for relief include those dealt on a recognised stock exchange in the UK or elsewhere; authorised unit trusts; UK open-ended investment company shares; and some foreign collective investment schemes. At the Charities Aid Foundation, donors can use their shares in three ways. \u0095 To open a CharityCard account, into which the proceeds of the sold shares will be placed, and from which you can distribute money to the causes of your choice; \u0095 To start a charitable trust, where CAF will sell the shares and invest in tax-advantaged funds. You can then make donations to charities of your choice from the dividends and interest; \u0095 To give or sell your shares to CAF, so long as the proceeds less the purchase cost paid to the donor exceeds \u00a3250 and the market value is at least 25 per cent higher than the purchase figure. If you don't have shares to sell, there are other ways to divert money from Gordon Brown's coffers to charity - and give your donation a boost along the way. Gift Aid This scheme, for one-off and regular donations, received an enormous fillip in the past year, when it was extended from a minimum of \u00a3250 to gifts of any amount. If you stipulate that your donation is under Gift Aid, the Inland Revenue treats it as net of basic-rate tax. Charities can claim the equivalent of basic-rate tax on your gift from the Revenue. Higher-rate donors can claim 18 per cent relief (the difference between basic and higher rate) for the gift on their returns.

In fact, Test cricket has been in pretty rude health for that past decade, but we have not always noticed that in England.</p> <p>The reason for the transformation here is plain to see. England now have a handy side and they are winning. Bring on the Aussies, we cry. </p> <p>But before we dredge up our collective animosity towards the old enemy in advance of the Ashes series we should recognise that, of all the Test-playing countries, it is the Australians who have been most responsible for the resurgence of modern Test cricket. A drawn game is an anathema to Australia. Mark Taylor, recognising that he had a potent attack, instigated this policy: score the runs fast and give the bowlers time to win the game. Steve Waugh has pursued that philosophy with equal vigour. Even in Chennai, when Australia were on the rack on the fourth evening of the deciding Test, Waugh had no thoughts of hanging on for a draw. 'If we can get 180 ahead, we can win this game,' he said. They almost did. Draws are far less frequent now in every part of the globe. Pitches are not so reliable and batsman-friendly - except in New Zealand. Batsmen, schooled in one-day cricket, are more aggressive - except the English. One oddity about this winter, which we won't complain about too much, is that Nasser Hussain's England scored far more slowly than their opponents in both their winter tours, yet they still prevailed. And there is more variety in the modern Test match. In the Eighties, the West Indies set out their template for success: four awesome fast bowlers working to a rigid rota system was all they needed. With the discovery of a genius, Shane Warne, the Australians discovered a better way, which has given the twiddlers - from Murali, Saqlain, Mushtaq Ahmed, Kumble to Singh - hope and encouragement (we won't include Giles and Croft just yet). Moreover, in this past week, whether in Colombo, Port of Spain or Chennai we have witnessed the magic of the five-day format, which is mirrored only in golf, whose Ryder Cup mercilessly exposes the bare bones of the players day after day. Five days allow us to become absorbed in the main characters in the plot; the tempo can change dramatically as a tranquil partnership gives way to a sudden collapse. There is time for the game to fluctuate deliciously, for the tension to build imperceptibly. A five-act play can be so much more rewarding than a video short. It is remarkable that we can be thinking such thoughts after a year in which cricket has been riddled with crises. Much still needs to be sorted: the stain of match-fixing, the standard and procedures of umpiring Test matches and, with particular reference to this summer of cricket in England, the quality of the Test pitches. The English game cannot afford many more three-day Tests, especially since the presence of those Australians could provide such a bonanza. Yet we are all now hungry for more. Even though the first Test against Australia does not start until 5 July at Edgbaston and there are two Tests against Pakistan and a triangular series before then, the Ashes series already beguiles us. It will underpin all our cricketing deliberations. So here's this week's Ashes thought. Did you spot Shane Warne's bowling figures in Chennai - two for 181 on a pitch where Harbhajan Singh took 15 wickets? Has Warne, like his kindred spirit, Ian Botham, at the tail-end of his Test career, come to rely more on his charisma and reputation rather than any intrinsic venom in his deliveries for his wickets? England are an ageing side with about a year to run and one final chance of glory before changes are inevitable. Next autumn the rebuilding must start in earnest. Maybe one or two of the Aussies are creaking as well. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Equal pay 'tsars' will shame sexist employers into giving women a fair wage under a government action plan to root out workplace discrimination. Ministers will stage an annual summit to review the progress made for working women, at which poor performers will be expected to explain why they pay their female workers less than males. Meanwhile, leading figures from the arts, trade unions and business will be appointed as fair pay 'champions' within their industries. However, Employment Minister Tessa Jowell, who is to unveil the package on Tuesday, is likely to come under fire from equal opportunities' watchdogs for rejecting their demands for mandatory 'pay audits' or for a change in the law. The Equal Opportunities Commission wants employers to be forced to review the salaries of all staff and publish findings, exposing any discrimination. But Ministers have rejected the idea, which risks antagonising the business lobby, arguing that the pay gap is not only caused by sexism but also by women choosing or being steered into low-paid and low-skilled jobs. Jowell will say these are practical problems requiring 'practical solutions', not more legislation. 'An 18 per cent pay gap is totally unacceptable. Even an 0.8 per cent pay gap is totally unacceptable. Any pay gap driven by discrimination is totally unacceptable,' she will say. 'The Government will be working in partnership with business and the trade unions to make sure that the next ten years will be a decade for women in work, a decade in which the employment opportunities for all women will improve and in which the unfair, unacceptable and unlawful pay gap will be closed.' Women currently earn only 82 per cent of men's rates for equivalent work. Although the gap has closed since 1979, when women on average earned 63p for every pound taken home by a man in the same job, experts argue that 30 years of anti-sex discrimination laws have failed to close it and that more drastic action is needed. Recent research by the Women's Unit in Whitehall exploded the myth that women earn less simply because they have family responsibilities, showing that even childless females can expect to earn more than \u00a3100,000 less than men in the same jobs over their lifetimes. Jowell's plan will focus on part-time workers, for whom the gap in hourly pay is even wider, and women returning to work after having children. New mothers on average see their hourly pay fall by up to 16 per cent when they go back, partly because employers may assume they are no longer as committed to careers and partly because many go back to slightly different jobs. The network of 'pay champions' will spearhead a public campaign making it unacceptable to give women workers a poorer deal. Jowell will organise a yearly summit, the first of which is expected later this year, for business and the unions at which progress will be reviewed and poor performers identified.

      "body": "<p>During his chats in Stockholm with his European confr\u00e8res, there was much private pity from his peer group for the predicament of Tony Blair, a sympathy which extended even to those leaders whose own countries have been infected by foot and mouth. They will have winced in empathy with the humiliation reportedly meted out to Mr Blair by the Swedish authorities when they demanded that the food on his plane be incinerated for fear that the Prime Minister was a carrier of disease from plague island. The compassion felt for Mr Blair by his counterparts ran even deeper. The world over, premiers and presidents fear the same thing. All leaders are gripped by terror of the unknown.</p> <p>Politicians must believe - as they also need their electorates to be convinced - that they are in control of events. The leaders to be admired are those who, in the phrase of Joe Chamberlain, 'make the weather'. The leaders who become despised are those, like John Major, who get rained on until they are washed away by contempt. A dismal omen of the gravity of this emergency is the reappearance of Mr Major on the airwaves. There's a man worth listening to about crises - and how not to handle them.</p> <p>Foot and mouth is growing from an agricultural disaster into a political calamity because it increasingly seems beyond the capacity of the Government to get it under control. Burning the disease is not working. Trying to talk the epidemic away is proving no more successful. Despite the combined attentions of the veterinary service and the college of spin doctors, the evil bug is more virulent than ever.</p> <p>Not only do the number of outbreaks continue to increase. Even more importantly from the anguished perspective of Number 10, each news bulletin and newspaper headline announcing further surges in the infection brings out blisters and weals on the Government's reputation for competence. Another sure signal of the severity of the crisis is that the blame game has begun within Whitehall. No one can fault Nick Brown for scrupulously following the guidance of his officials. The Agriculture Minister has been a dedicated implementer and frontman of the advice from the experts. What Mr Brown can be faulted for is precisely that - following the advice of officialdom. The bureaucracy of the Ministry of Agriculture, whose previous triumphs include salmonella in eggs and mad cow disease, has again failed both its farming client group and the nation. When the Prime Minister finally applies himself to reconfiguring Whitehall, he must surely send this most wretched department to the abattoir.</p> <p>The Conservatives have been emboldened to become more oppositional because they sense that the Government has fallen badly behind the curve.

      "bodyText": "During his chats in Stockholm with his European confr\u00e8res, there was much private pity from his peer group for the predicament of Tony Blair, a sympathy which extended even to those leaders whose own countries have been infected by foot and mouth. They will have winced in empathy with the humiliation reportedly meted out to Mr Blair by the Swedish authorities when they demanded that the food on his plane be incinerated for fear that the Prime Minister was a carrier of disease from plague island. The compassion felt for Mr Blair by his counterparts ran even deeper. The world over, premiers and presidents fear the same thing. All leaders are gripped by terror of the unknown. Politicians must believe - as they also need their electorates to be convinced - that they are in control of events. The leaders to be admired are those who, in the phrase of Joe Chamberlain, 'make the weather'. The leaders who become despised are those, like John Major, who get rained on until they are washed away by contempt. A dismal omen of the gravity of this emergency is the reappearance of Mr Major on the airwaves. There's a man worth listening to about crises - and how not to handle them. Foot and mouth is growing from an agricultural disaster into a political calamity because it increasingly seems beyond the capacity of the Government to get it under control. Burning the disease is not working. Trying to talk the epidemic away is proving no more successful. Despite the combined attentions of the veterinary service and the college of spin doctors, the evil bug is more virulent than ever. Not only do the number of outbreaks continue to increase. Even more importantly from the anguished perspective of Number 10, each news bulletin and newspaper headline announcing further surges in the infection brings out blisters and weals on the Government's reputation for competence. Another sure signal of the severity of the crisis is that the blame game has begun within Whitehall. No one can fault Nick Brown for scrupulously following the guidance of his officials. The Agriculture Minister has been a dedicated implementer and frontman of the advice from the experts. What Mr Brown can be faulted for is precisely that - following the advice of officialdom. The bureaucracy of the Ministry of Agriculture, whose previous triumphs include salmonella in eggs and mad cow disease, has again failed both its farming client group and the nation. When the Prime Minister finally applies himself to reconfiguring Whitehall, he must surely send this most wretched department to the abattoir. The Conservatives have been emboldened to become more oppositional because they sense that the Government has fallen badly behind the curve. We have it on the damaging testimony of the Government's chief scientist that the central thrust of the policy - slaughter - has not been carried out properly. Condemned animals are being left to live too long and carcasses are being allowed to rot, permitting the virus to be spread by the passing breeze.

      "body": "<p> 'It's not a question of breaking the rules, don't you understand?' the 25-year-old, amphetamine-fuelled, stick thin, impossibly cool Bob Dylan told his biographer Robert Shelton in 1966. 'I don't break rules because I don't see any rules to break. As far as I'm concerned there aren't any rules.' As a statement of intent, it was suitably fearless, consummately self-confident and, as pop history would prove, utterly self-fulfilling. It was also Dylan willing himself into pop history as the first avatar of a new kind of cool, the first truly modern pop icon, standing, unchallenged, at the epicentre of a seismic pop cultural shift, the reverberations of which are still being felt today. </p> <p>And, back then, of course, Bob Dylan was breaking all the rules, and doing it with a momentum that was both breathtaking and almost arrogantly casual in its iconoclasm. He was not a new Elvis Presley, oozing untrammelled sexual energy, speaking the inchoate language of pure rock and roll. He was something else entirely; something new, unforeseen: a visionary, a surrealist of sorts. 'What made you decide to go the rock and roll route?' Nat Hentoff asked him in a famously suppressed 1966 interview for Playboy. To which Dylan answered: 'Carelessness.' </p> <p>From the start though, as the unlikely self-styled heir to dustbowl balladeer Woody Guthrie, Dylan was someone who saw the bigger picture, and his place within it. Born Robert Allen Zimmerman, son of a middle-class Jewish shopkeeper, in Duluth, Minnesota in 1941 he grew up in Hibbing, a mining area already in terminal decline that would later become the setting for songs like 'North Country Blues'. In 1959 he attended the University of Minnesota, where he immersed himself in the burgeoning coffee house folk circuit. </p> <p>There, he changed his name in homage, he said later, to the western hero Matt Dillon. By 1962 Dillon had become Dylan, in deference to Welsh poet Dylan Thomas. After dropping out of college he lived in Dinkytown, the bohemian quarter of Minneapolis, and absorbed the heady atmosphere of the time: beat poetry, radical politics and protest folk. Around this time, too, Dylan started reinventing his past, passing himself off as a hobo musician in the mould of his hero Guthrie. In 1960 he made a pilgrimage to New York, turning up unannounced at the ailing singer's house. They talked; the baton of history and tradition was passed, and the following year, on his spartan, eponymous debut album, Dylan recorded 'Song To Woody', a farewell song to his mentor. </p> <p>By 1964 he had triumphed at the Newport Folk Festival, formed a romantic liaison with Joan Baez, leading light of American musical liberalism, and recorded The Times They Are A-Changin', an album that pushed him into the vanguard of the protest folk movement. The following year, though, he released Another Side of Bob Dylan, which included 'My Back Pages', another farewell song, with the refrain, 'I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now'. This time he was saying goodbye to the folk genre he had done so much to revitalise. </p> <p>In D.A. Pennebaker's film of his 1965 British tour, Don't Look Back, Dylan is restless, confined, cool to the point of dismissive of those around him. You can see Baez shrinking into the background, as a newer, more ruthless Dylan emerges: a man with a mission to rearrange the contours of the popular song, to make history by riding roughshod over the past. Even he, though, could not have anticipated the furore and the scenes of mixed up confusion that would attend his reinvention as a rock demi-god. When he walked on stage at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, trailing a hastily assembled pick-up band and carrying an electric guitar the way some people carried a gun, nonchalantly but with latent intent, the world of pop shifted on its axis. </p> <p>To howls of disapproval and disbelief that were to be echoed across America and Britain on his subsequent tour with the Hawks, (soon to become The Band), Dylan single-highhandedly blasted protest folk, a form he had already redefined, into oblivion. In 1965 and 1966 he unleashed a clutch of songs that were nothing short of revelatory: the jangled-up thrust of 'Subterranean Homesick Blues'; the rolling, tumbling electric poetry of 'Like A Rolling Stone' and 'Positively 4th Street'; the cryptic, multi-layered allusion of 'Visions of Johanna'. These were brash, fearless, declamatory songs, that, in their majestic newness, heralded the birth of the modern rock era and the end of the pop song as a signifier of a certain kind of teen innocence. This 'wild mercury sound', as Dylan would later describe it, was the sound of the future breaking, confused and uncertain and unstoppable. </p> <p>In retrospect we can see how this new, electric music and strange, druggy poetry, surging along on the momentum of discovery, pitched popular music, lyrically and tonally, into a brave new world where, to one degree or another, it has remained ever since. A world were the humble pop song, until then a vehicle for untainted romance and a certain kind of inarticulate but potent teen frustration, suddenly became a medium of infinite possibility. This intense mid-Sixties burst of creativity has remained unmatched in modern music. The young Dylan rewrote the rules of pop like no one before or since, and, one way or another, we have been living with the legacy ever since. </p> <p>And so, of course, has he. 'Everybody works in the shadow of what they have previously done,' he said in 1989, 'but you have to overcome that.' More than any other postwar performer, Bob Dylan has done his best to demolish his own mythology, at first retreating into blissful domesticity in rural Woodstock in the late Sixties; then doing his best to simply ignore his iconic standing throughout the Seventies; then actively dismantling it in the Eighties with certain records that were so ugly and unlistenable, so perfunctory and perverse, even the most obsessive Dylanologist - and, believe me, there is no bore like a Dylan bore - had to shake their head and cover their ears in dismay. 'Bob took his art so low,' his one-time accomplice Cesar Diaz once remarked, 'that all he had to do to come back was just to throw out a signal that he was still alive.' </p> <p>Along the way, too, he has embraced cocaine and booze, Judaism and born-again Christianity, the latter with a self-righteous fervour that astonished and alienated all but his most faithful fans. And, latterly, he has toured and toured, and then toured some more, as if over-familiarity, alongside a wilful perversity when it comes to the choosing and reinterpreting of his own songs, might dispel the myth. He has toured so much it made him ill. Then, having recovered, he has toured some more. If he's not playing somewhere tonight, it's only because he might be picking up an Oscar for Best Song (for 'Things Have Changed' from The Wonder Boys). </p> <p>It has been that way for the past 10 years or more: a series of ever-changing performances - Dylan never plays the same song the same way twice - in a series of depressingly similar, soul-destroying mid-size arenas across the globe. The Never Ending Tour, he calls it, without a trace of irony. 'A lot of people don't like the road,' he said in 1997, 'but it's as natural to me as breathing. It's the only place you can be who you want to be. I don't want to put on the mask of celebrity. I'd rather just do my work and see it as a trade'. </p> <p>' I don't want to put on the mask of celebrity .' Think about that for a moment. Then think how long Bob Dylan has thought about it. He said it when he was 56 - 30 years after retreating from his initial celebrity (though it was not called that back then), and after a decade of dogged globetrotting in pursuit of some ideal of ubiquitous anonymity. He must surely have had John Updike's darkly prescient remark echoing in his head: 'Celebrity is a mask that eats into the face'. </p> <p>For a while back there, when Dylan shows had reached a nadir of sorts in the bleak, sleek Eighties, he even took to appearing on stage behind a mask, his kohl-rimmed eyes staring out of a haggard face caked in pale make-up. I am a performer, he seemed to be saying, not a myth; an actor, not a celebrity. </p> <p>And in a way, through sheer force of will, he has hauled himself to a place that is outside of, or beyond, what we now understand by the word celebrity. In his often startling sleeve notes to 1993's World Gone Wrong album - one of what I would call the great critically misunderstood Bob Dylan albums, alongside 1969's Nashville Skyline and 1979's Slow Train Coming - he wrote, apropos of the traditional song, 'Stack A Lee': 'What does the song say exactly? It says no man gains immortality through public acclaim ... fame is a trick.' </p> <p>What World Gone Wrong, like many of Dylan's late albums, spoke of most loudly, though, was his disgust at the world, and the world of pop culture in particular. Bob Dylan, as he has told us over and over again, in one way or another, does not fit. Bob Dylan belongs somewhere else: outside of pop, outside of fame, outside, even, of time as it is now measured in pop terms. And yet, Bob Dylan lives on in pop, and pop legend: inviolate, iconic and enduringly mysterious, despite himself. </p> <p>'I'd rather just do my work and see it as a trade.' This, too, is where Dylan is at right now. His view of his work, and, by extension, of himself, is as wildly out of step with the broad thrust of contemporary pop culture as his self-styled 'wild mercury sound' was with the prevailing tameness of the pre-electric pop Sixties. Again, he wills it this way. Whatever else his trawling through beliefs, styles and traditions, and his myriad often grotesque re-readings of his own classics may tell us, they speak most loudly of a sustained restlessness, a refusal to stay put, in musical terms, but, more importantly, in terms of pop history's idea of him. He is governed by the true artist's dictum, which, as the poet Paul Muldoon points out, was best articulated by Yeats's line, 'Myself I must remake'. Thus, Dylan keeps on moving, tries his best not to stand still long enough to be canonised, or reduced - and, in a way, they are the same things - by pop history and pop tradition as it is defined by a now middle-aged industry intent on endless, essentially insecure self-aggrandisement. </p> <p>When Dylan, looking not so much uncomfortable as demoralised, reluctantly received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 1991 Grammys, he held it at arm's length like a diseased rag and made the most cryptic yet chillingly apposite short acceptance speech ever: 'My daddy once said to me, he said, \"Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own Mother and Father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in your own ability to mend your own ways\".' </p> <p> God will believe in your own ability to mend your ways . That is so effortlessly Dylanesque, yet so dripping in Biblical resonances, you have to wonder whether he ad-libbed it or rehearsed it in his head beforehand. Either way, his response speaks of a profound distaste for the trappings of contemporary music culture, and a healthy disregard for the protocol of pop's industry-led celebration of itself. The late period Dylan, then, like the early Dylan, but in an altogether different way, is a moralist. Disgust, though, has replaced righteous anger just as iconoclasm has long since given way to wilful perversity. </p> <p>Dylan the contrary first surfaced after his initial flight from fame in 1966. Riding his beloved motorcycle to the repair shop in Woodstock, he came off on a corner, was knocked unconscious and taken to hospital wearing a neck brace. The accident turned out not to be that serious, but the ensuing year-long silence from Dylan fuelled rumours that he had been seriously hurt, even disfigured. In his absence, the myth grew accordingly. The chastened singer, meanwhile, retreated behind the gates of his rambling house in Woodstock in upstate New York. </p> <p>He had just completed his gruelling 1966 tour, every electrified performance a battle of wills with an audience still in thrall to his increasingly labyrinthine, but reassuringly acoustic, songs; an audience unknowingly resisting the tidal sway of pop history, who were playing out an age-old drama centring on the battle between the almost new and the truly, terrifyingly new. </p> <p>Combative concert performances like the one captured on the now infamous Manchester Free Trade Hall bootleg, where one irate audience member cries out 'Judas' just before the thunderous intro to 'Like A Rolling Stone', had left Dylan and The Band exhausted and demoralised, limping back to America without the stamina, nor indeed the will, to persevere with their great sonic adventure. </p> <p>In Pennebaker's unreleased tour film, Eat the Document, a visibly strung-out Dylan trades acid one-liners with John Lennon in the back of a limo before suddenly turning pale and pleading with the driver to take them back to the hotel. He looks wounded and fragile, panicky and close to breakdown, the psychic cost of his unparalleled surge of creativity visible in every twitch and stammer. </p> <p>Behind Dylan the icon, the arbiter of new cool, behind that mask of seeming invincibility, there was an uncertain, even desolate individual. 'People live with hope for green trees and beautiful flowers,' his first serious girlfriend, Suze Rotolo, would later say of this time, 'but Dylan seems to lack that simple hope, at least he did from 1964 to 1966. This darkness wasn't new to me, but it became stronger as the years passed by.' </p> <p>The motorcycle crash then, though not serious, seems to have pulled him back from a bigger abyss. For a while, as the pop world waited for guidance from its most revered sage, Dylan, approaching 30, found solace in the simple comforts of home and hearth. Outside, America raged in a fitful war with itself; the psychedelic era, which he had prefigured as far back as 1965 with 'Mr Tambourine Man', came and went while Dylan rediscovered his folk roots and delved deep into country. A plushly packaged photographic book, Dylan in Woodstock by Elliot Landy, surfaced last year: it shows a bucolic family man, his hair and beard trimmed, his filled-out features smiling mischievously for the camera. Whether bouncing on a trampoline in his back garden or shopping at the local store, Dylan, looking like a country rabbi, seems for once utterly content, free from the weight of his own myth, at one with himself. He has never seemed anywhere near as content since. </p> <p>The root of his enduring unhappiness, it would appear, lies in his divorce in 1977 from his long-suffering wife, Sara, mother of five of his children. Their protracted break-up followed a long, volatile period where Dylan's immersion in booze, cocaine and a series of casual adulteries fractured the short-lived calm of the family-centred Woodstock years. Both 1975's Blood on the Tracks, his last truly great album, and its successor, Desire (1976), had mapped out his obsessive devotion to Sara who, even as he let her slip away, exerted an almost mystical hold on him. She remains an enduring muse, and seems as palpably present on his most recent album, 1999's Time Out of Mind, as she did on the plaintive lost love song that bore her name on Desire. </p> <p>For a while, the void left by Sara's departure was filled by reckless, seemingly obsessive womanising: he even shacked up briefly with their children's nanny. By 1979, and the release of Slow Train Coming, it was clear that another unlikely shift of consciousness had occurred: Dylan had done the unthinkable and embraced born-again Christianity. On the subsequent triumvirate of Christian albums, Saved (1980), Shot of Love (1981) and Infidels (1984), he raged and fulminated against the wickedness of the world and the folly of those who did not share his post-conversion world view. </p> <p>His performances, uneven at the best of times, were now punctuated with long semi-extemporised, disturbingly self-righteous sermons. The master of irony and symbolism had, for a time at least, become a born-again bore. 'Happiness is not on my list of priorities,' he told a reporter in 1986. 'I just deal with day to day things... it's not happiness or unhappiness, it's either blessed or unblessed. As the Bible says, \"Blessed is the man who walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly\".' </p> <p>And yet sparks of greatness remained. Today, Slow Train Coming has, as the initial shock of its unfashionable, god-fearing message has faded, come to be regarded as a powerful if uneasy testament. A God album that manages to sound as bitter and twisted, and indeed ungodly, as some of his old spleen-venting songs like 'Positively 4th Street'. On Shot of Love, he sang 'Every Grain of Sand', a secular song that, for me, stands head and shoulders in its craft and spare poetry above many of the inflated, symbolist outpourings like 'Desolation Row', which always seem, bafflingly, to precipitate those weary old Is Dylan Better Than Keats? debates that surface from the bowels of academia every so often. </p> <p>The late period Dylan, too, has surprised all but the most faithful: 1989's No Mercy, and 1999's Time Out of Mind, garnered ecstatic reviews, though the consensual chorus of approval that greeted the latter album, which followed on his recent health scare and hospitalisation, seemed to suggest a collective mild hysteria rather than reasoned thinking. Last year's European tour, though, often approached the revelatory, despite Dylan looking frail and suddenly old on stage, his gaunt frame in silhouette a cruel echo of the stick-thin, seemingly immortal Dylan circa 1966. </p> <p>Thus, he perseveres, changes, yet remains essentially the same: a voyager, an artist following no one's rules but his own. In a strange but no doubt conscious way he has become his heroes - the old folk singers and gospel singers, the itinerant balladeers and blues men whose legacy of love songs, death ballads, spirituals and moral tales he steeped himself in as a teenager in Hibbing, Minnesota. The endless touring, the insistence that performance is a job like any other, that music is essentially a craft that must be practised, honed, forever reinvented, are old-fashioned ideals. Their currency precedes a time not just before samplers and digital recordings, but before pop as we know it. </p> <p>Dylan at 60 seems to be saying what he has always, even at his most self-destructive, said: that he is part of a longer, deeper lineage, that encompasses the whole sweep of American music, of American experience as it was rendered through the ballad, the blues song, and the folk song, as well as the pop song. </p> <p>He is bigger than pop, and his music is bigger than any of these generic terms. In his ragged voice, and in the range of his poetry, from the freeform surrealism of that iconoclastic mid-Sixties moment when he was young and fearless, to the busted, frail beauty of a song like the valedictory 'Not Dark Yet', you can hear echoes of other American poets like Herman Melville and Woody Guthrie, Mark Twain and Robert Johnson; you can hear echoes of America, old and young, innocent and defamed. </p> <p>And Dylan, in his way, is as unfathomable and indefinable as America itself. When he was asked by a journalist in 1985 whom he would like to interview, he plucked, as if from thin air, names like Hank Williams, Apollinaire and Paul the Apostle. 'I'd like to interview people who died leaving a great unsolved mess behind,' he explained, 'who left people for ages with nothing to do but speculate.' </p> <p>He could have included himself at the top of that list. As he approaches 60, one feels that the speculation is only just beginning. In an age where music has all but surrendered its ability to startle, Dylan remains the template for a certain, increasingly rare, kind of artistic reinvention: endless, ongoing, unpredictable. Long may he continue to question our assumptions about the Bob Dylan we think we know. </p> <p><strong>Bob Dylan: Myths and facts</strong> </p> <p>Myth: Dylan broke his neck in a serious motorcycle accident in July 1966 and nearly died. The accident scared him so much he quit heroin. </p> <p>Fact: Dylan fell off his bike while pootling around his estate, cracked a vertebra and had to wear a neck brace for a while, but was otherwise unscathed. He did get off smack, however. </p> <p>Fact: Singers hyped as 'The New Dylan' have included Bruce Springsteen, Donovan, Loudon Wainwright III, John Prine, Steve Forbert, David Blue and Neil Young. Dylan made reference to them in Idiot Wind as 'Imitators who steal me blind'. The only real new Dylan is Bob's son Jakob, leader of The Wallflowers. </p> <p>Fact: When Dylan showed up in the north London suburb of Crouch End to meet his buddy, Eurythmic Dave Stewart, he dropped in on the wrong Dave Stewart, whose wife served the star tea and biscuits unaware of who he was. Her husband, when he appeared, was somewhat more impressed... </p> <p>Myth: Dylan and Elvis played together in Nashville in May 1971. The set list included 'Blowin' In The Wind', 'In The Ghetto' and 'Silent Night'. </p> <p>Fact: No tape of this encounter has ever surfaced. </p> <p>Myth: Dylan turned the Beatles on to pot. </p> <p>Fact: Dylan and journalist Al Aronowitz did indeed hand the Fab Four joints at New York's Delmonico hotel in August 1965 but as former model Cherri Gilham revealed recently in The Observer, she had already smoked pot with Lennon and McCartney in London. </p> <p>Myth: The woman in red on the cover of Bringing It All Back Home is really a man in drag. </p> <p>Fact: She is Sally Grossman, wife of Bob's manager Albert Grossman. The cuff links Dylan wears in the shot were given to him by Joan Baez, who years later mentioned them in her song, 'Diamonds and Rust'. </p> <p>Myth: Dylan has dozens of love children. </p> <p>Fact: Dylan has claimed that 'many women in the world have my children', but there are only known to be seven; five with his wife Sara and two others since by now-departed lovers. </p> <p>Fact: 'Bob Dylan knows all the secrets of the universe - but he ain't telling.'

      "bodyText": "'It's not a question of breaking the rules, don't you understand?' the 25-year-old, amphetamine-fuelled, stick thin, impossibly cool Bob Dylan told his biographer Robert Shelton in 1966. 'I don't break rules because I don't see any rules to break. As far as I'm concerned there aren't any rules.' As a statement of intent, it was suitably fearless, consummately self-confident and, as pop history would prove, utterly self-fulfilling. It was also Dylan willing himself into pop history as the first avatar of a new kind of cool, the first truly modern pop icon, standing, unchallenged, at the epicentre of a seismic pop cultural shift, the reverberations of which are still being felt today. And, back then, of course, Bob Dylan was breaking all the rules, and doing it with a momentum that was both breathtaking and almost arrogantly casual in its iconoclasm. He was not a new Elvis Presley, oozing untrammelled sexual energy, speaking the inchoate language of pure rock and roll. He was something else entirely; something new, unforeseen: a visionary, a surrealist of sorts. 'What made you decide to go the rock and roll route?' Nat Hentoff asked him in a famously suppressed 1966 interview for Playboy. To which Dylan answered: 'Carelessness.' From the start though, as the unlikely self-styled heir to dustbowl balladeer Woody Guthrie, Dylan was someone who saw the bigger picture, and his place within it. Born Robert Allen Zimmerman, son of a middle-class Jewish shopkeeper, in Duluth, Minnesota in 1941 he grew up in Hibbing, a mining area already in terminal decline that would later become the setting for songs like 'North Country Blues'. In 1959 he attended the University of Minnesota, where he immersed himself in the burgeoning coffee house folk circuit. There, he changed his name in homage, he said later, to the western hero Matt Dillon. By 1962 Dillon had become Dylan, in deference to Welsh poet Dylan Thomas. After dropping out of college he lived in Dinkytown, the bohemian quarter of Minneapolis, and absorbed the heady atmosphere of the time: beat poetry, radical politics and protest folk. Around this time, too, Dylan started reinventing his past, passing himself off as a hobo musician in the mould of his hero Guthrie. In 1960 he made a pilgrimage to New York, turning up unannounced at the ailing singer's house. They talked; the baton of history and tradition was passed, and the following year, on his spartan, eponymous debut album, Dylan recorded 'Song To Woody', a farewell song to his mentor. By 1964 he had triumphed at the Newport Folk Festival, formed a romantic liaison with Joan Baez, leading light of American musical liberalism, and recorded The Times They Are A-Changin', an album that pushed him into the vanguard of the protest folk movement. The following year, though, he released Another Side of Bob Dylan, which included 'My Back Pages', another farewell song, with the refrain, 'I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now'. This time he was saying goodbye to the folk genre he had done so much to revitalise. In D.A. Pennebaker's film of his 1965 British tour, Don't Look Back, Dylan is restless, confined, cool to the point of dismissive of those around him. You can see Baez shrinking into the background, as a newer, more ruthless Dylan emerges: a man with a mission to rearrange the contours of the popular song, to make history by riding roughshod over the past. Even he, though, could not have anticipated the furore and the scenes of mixed up confusion that would attend his reinvention as a rock demi-god. When he walked on stage at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, trailing a hastily assembled pick-up band and carrying an electric guitar the way some people carried a gun, nonchalantly but with latent intent, the world of pop shifted on its axis. To howls of disapproval and disbelief that were to be echoed across America and Britain on his subsequent tour with the Hawks, (soon to become The Band), Dylan single-highhandedly blasted protest folk, a form he had already redefined, into oblivion. In 1965 and 1966 he unleashed a clutch of songs that were nothing short of revelatory: the jangled-up thrust of 'Subterranean Homesick Blues'; the rolling, tumbling electric poetry of 'Like A Rolling Stone' and 'Positively 4th Street'; the cryptic, multi-layered allusion of 'Visions of Johanna'. These were brash, fearless, declamatory songs, that, in their majestic newness, heralded the birth of the modern rock era and the end of the pop song as a signifier of a certain kind of teen innocence. This 'wild mercury sound', as Dylan would later describe it, was the sound of the future breaking, confused and uncertain and unstoppable. In retrospect we can see how this new, electric music and strange, druggy poetry, surging along on the momentum of discovery, pitched popular music, lyrically and tonally, into a brave new world where, to one degree or another, it has remained ever since. A world were the humble pop song, until then a vehicle for untainted romance and a certain kind of inarticulate but potent teen frustration, suddenly became a medium of infinite possibility. This intense mid-Sixties burst of creativity has remained unmatched in modern music. The young Dylan rewrote the rules of pop like no one before or since, and, one way or another, we have been living with the legacy ever since. And so, of course, has he. 'Everybody works in the shadow of what they have previously done,' he said in 1989, 'but you have to overcome that.' More than any other postwar performer, Bob Dylan has done his best to demolish his own mythology, at first retreating into blissful domesticity in rural Woodstock in the late Sixties; then doing his best to simply ignore his iconic standing throughout the Seventies; then actively dismantling it in the Eighties with certain records that were so ugly and unlistenable, so perfunctory and perverse, even the most obsessive Dylanologist - and, believe me, there is no bore like a Dylan bore - had to shake their head and cover their ears in dismay. 'Bob took his art so low,' his one-time accomplice Cesar Diaz once remarked, 'that all he had to do to come back was just to throw out a signal that he was still alive.' Along the way, too, he has embraced cocaine and booze, Judaism and born-again Christianity, the latter with a self-righteous fervour that astonished and alienated all but his most faithful fans. And, latterly, he has toured and toured, and then toured some more, as if over-familiarity, alongside a wilful perversity when it comes to the choosing and reinterpreting of his own songs, might dispel the myth. He has toured so much it made him ill. Then, having recovered, he has toured some more. If he's not playing somewhere tonight, it's only because he might be picking up an Oscar for Best Song (for 'Things Have Changed' from The Wonder Boys). It has been that way for the past 10 years or more: a series of ever-changing performances - Dylan never plays the same song the same way twice - in a series of depressingly similar, soul-destroying mid-size arenas across the globe. The Never Ending Tour, he calls it, without a trace of irony. 'A lot of people don't like the road,' he said in 1997, 'but it's as natural to me as breathing. It's the only place you can be who you want to be. I don't want to put on the mask of celebrity. I'd rather just do my work and see it as a trade'. ' I don't want to put on the mask of celebrity .' Think about that for a moment. Then think how long Bob Dylan has thought about it. He said it when he was 56 - 30 years after retreating from his initial celebrity (though it was not called that back then), and after a decade of dogged globetrotting in pursuit of some ideal of ubiquitous anonymity. He must surely have had John Updike's darkly prescient remark echoing in his head: 'Celebrity is a mask that eats into the face'. For a while back there, when Dylan shows had reached a nadir of sorts in the bleak, sleek Eighties, he even took to appearing on stage behind a mask, his kohl-rimmed eyes staring out of a haggard face caked in pale make-up. I am a performer, he seemed to be saying, not a myth; an actor, not a celebrity. And in a way, through sheer force of will, he has hauled himself to a place that is outside of, or beyond, what we now understand by the word celebrity. In his often startling sleeve notes to 1993's World Gone Wrong album - one of what I would call the great critically misunderstood Bob Dylan albums, alongside 1969's Nashville Skyline and 1979's Slow Train Coming - he wrote, apropos of the traditional song, 'Stack A Lee': 'What does the song say exactly? It says no man gains immortality through public acclaim ... fame is a trick.' What World Gone Wrong, like many of Dylan's late albums, spoke of most loudly, though, was his disgust at the world, and the world of pop culture in particular. Bob Dylan, as he has told us over and over again, in one way or another, does not fit. Bob Dylan belongs somewhere else: outside of pop, outside of fame, outside, even, of time as it is now measured in pop terms. And yet, Bob Dylan lives on in pop, and pop legend: inviolate, iconic and enduringly mysterious, despite himself. 'I'd rather just do my work and see it as a trade.'

He is governed by the true artist's dictum, which, as the poet Paul Muldoon points out, was best articulated by Yeats's line, 'Myself I must remake'. Thus, Dylan keeps on moving, tries his best not to stand still long enough to be canonised, or reduced - and, in a way, they are the same things - by pop history and pop tradition as it is defined by a now middle-aged industry intent on endless, essentially insecure self-aggrandisement. When Dylan, looking not so much uncomfortable as demoralised, reluctantly received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 1991 Grammys, he held it at arm's length like a diseased rag and made the most cryptic yet chillingly apposite short acceptance speech ever: 'My daddy once said to me, he said, \"Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own Mother and Father will abandon you.

Combative concert performances like the one captured on the now infamous Manchester Free Trade Hall bootleg, where one irate audience member cries out 'Judas' just before the thunderous intro to 'Like A Rolling Stone', had left Dylan and The Band exhausted and demoralised, limping back to America without the stamina, nor indeed the will, to persevere with their great sonic adventure. In Pennebaker's unreleased tour film, Eat the Document, a visibly strung-out Dylan trades acid one-liners with John Lennon in the back of a limo before suddenly turning pale and pleading with the driver to take them back to the hotel. He looks wounded and fragile, panicky and close to breakdown, the psychic cost of his unparalleled surge of creativity visible in every twitch and stammer. Behind Dylan the icon, the arbiter of new cool, behind that mask of seeming invincibility, there was an uncertain, even desolate individual. 'People live with hope for green trees and beautiful flowers,' his first serious girlfriend, Suze Rotolo, would later say of this time, 'but Dylan seems to lack that simple hope, at least he did from 1964 to 1966. This darkness wasn't new to me, but it became stronger as the years passed by.' The motorcycle crash then, though not serious, seems to have pulled him back from a bigger abyss. For a while, as the pop world waited for guidance from its most revered sage, Dylan, approaching 30, found solace in the simple comforts of home and hearth. Outside, America raged in a fitful war with itself; the psychedelic era, which he had prefigured as far back as 1965 with 'Mr Tambourine Man', came and went while Dylan rediscovered his folk roots and delved deep into country. A plushly packaged photographic book, Dylan in Woodstock by Elliot Landy, surfaced last year: it shows a bucolic family man, his hair and beard trimmed, his filled-out features smiling mischievously for the camera. Whether bouncing on a trampoline in his back garden or shopping at the local store, Dylan, looking like a country rabbi, seems for once utterly content, free from the weight of his own myth, at one with himself. He has never seemed anywhere near as content since. The root of his enduring unhappiness, it would appear, lies in his divorce in 1977 from his long-suffering wife, Sara, mother of five of his children. Their protracted break-up followed a long, volatile period where Dylan's immersion in booze, cocaine and a series of casual adulteries fractured the short-lived calm of the family-centred Woodstock years. Both 1975's Blood on the Tracks, his last truly great album, and its successor, Desire (1976), had mapped out his obsessive devotion to Sara who, even as he let her slip away, exerted an almost mystical hold on him. She remains an enduring muse, and seems as palpably present on his most recent album, 1999's Time Out of Mind, as she did on the plaintive lost love song that bore her name on Desire. For a while, the void left by Sara's departure was filled by reckless, seemingly obsessive womanising: he even shacked up briefly with their children's nanny. By 1979, and the release of Slow Train Coming, it was clear that another unlikely shift of consciousness had occurred: Dylan had done the unthinkable and embraced born-again Christianity. On the subsequent triumvirate of Christian albums, Saved (1980), Shot of Love (1981) and Infidels (1984), he raged and fulminated against the wickedness of the world and the folly of those who did not share his post-conversion world view. His performances, uneven at the best of times, were now punctuated with long semi-extemporised, disturbingly self-righteous sermons. The master of irony and symbolism had, for a time at least, become a born-again bore. 'Happiness is not on my list of priorities,' he told a reporter in 1986. 'I just deal with day to day things... it's not happiness or unhappiness, it's either blessed or unblessed. As the Bible says, \"Blessed is the man who walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly\".' And yet sparks of greatness remained. Today, Slow Train Coming has, as the initial shock of its unfashionable, god-fearing message has faded, come to be regarded as a powerful if uneasy testament. A God album that manages to sound as bitter and twisted, and indeed ungodly, as some of his old spleen-venting songs like 'Positively 4th Street'. On Shot of Love, he sang 'Every Grain of Sand', a secular song that, for me, stands head and shoulders in its craft and spare poetry above many of the inflated, symbolist outpourings like 'Desolation Row', which always seem, bafflingly, to precipitate those weary old Is Dylan Better Than Keats? debates that surface from the bowels of academia every so often. The late period Dylan, too, has surprised all but the most faithful: 1989's No Mercy, and 1999's Time Out of Mind, garnered ecstatic reviews, though the consensual chorus of approval that greeted the latter album, which followed on his recent health scare and hospitalisation, seemed to suggest a collective mild hysteria rather than reasoned thinking. Last year's European tour, though, often approached the revelatory, despite Dylan looking frail and suddenly old on stage, his gaunt frame in silhouette a cruel echo of the stick-thin, seemingly immortal Dylan circa 1966. Thus, he perseveres, changes, yet remains essentially the same: a voyager, an artist following no one's rules but his own. In a strange but no doubt conscious way he has become his heroes - the old folk singers and gospel singers, the itinerant balladeers and blues men whose legacy of love songs, death ballads, spirituals and moral tales he steeped himself in as a teenager in Hibbing, Minnesota. The endless touring, the insistence that performance is a job like any other, that music is essentially a craft that must be practised, honed, forever reinvented, are old-fashioned ideals. Their currency precedes a time not just before samplers and digital recordings, but before pop as we know it. Dylan at 60 seems to be saying what he has always, even at his most self-destructive, said: that he is part of a longer, deeper lineage, that encompasses the whole sweep of American music, of American experience as it was rendered through the ballad, the blues song, and the folk song, as well as the pop song. He is bigger than pop, and his music is bigger than any of these generic terms. In his ragged voice, and in the range of his poetry, from the freeform surrealism of that iconoclastic mid-Sixties moment when he was young and fearless, to the busted, frail beauty of a song like the valedictory 'Not Dark Yet', you can hear echoes of other American poets like Herman Melville and Woody Guthrie, Mark Twain and Robert Johnson; you can hear echoes of America, old and young, innocent and defamed. And Dylan, in his way, is as unfathomable and indefinable as America itself. When he was asked by a journalist in 1985 whom he would like to interview, he plucked, as if from thin air, names like Hank Williams, Apollinaire and Paul the Apostle. 'I'd like to interview people who died leaving a great unsolved mess behind,' he explained, 'who left people for ages with nothing to do but speculate.' He could have included himself at the top of that list. As he approaches 60, one feels that the speculation is only just beginning. In an age where music has all but surrendered its ability to startle, Dylan remains the template for a certain, increasingly rare, kind of artistic reinvention: endless, ongoing, unpredictable. Long may he continue to question our assumptions about the Bob Dylan we think we know. Bob Dylan: Myths and facts Myth: Dylan broke his neck in a serious motorcycle accident in July 1966 and nearly died. The accident scared him so much he quit heroin. Fact: Dylan fell off his bike while pootling around his estate, cracked a vertebra and had to wear a neck brace for a while, but was otherwise unscathed. He did get off smack, however. Fact: Singers hyped as 'The New Dylan' have included Bruce Springsteen, Donovan, Loudon Wainwright III, John Prine, Steve Forbert, David Blue and Neil Young. Dylan made reference to them in Idiot Wind as 'Imitators who steal me blind'. The only real new Dylan is Bob's son Jakob, leader of The Wallflowers. Fact: When Dylan showed up in the north London suburb of Crouch End to meet his buddy, Eurythmic Dave Stewart, he dropped in on the wrong Dave Stewart, whose wife served the star tea and biscuits unaware of who he was. Her husband, when he appeared, was somewhat more impressed... Myth: Dylan and Elvis played together in Nashville in May 1971. The set list included 'Blowin' In The Wind', 'In The Ghetto' and 'Silent Night'. Fact: No tape of this encounter has ever surfaced. Myth: Dylan turned the Beatles on to pot. Fact: Dylan and journalist Al Aronowitz did indeed hand the Fab Four joints at New York's Delmonico hotel in August 1965 but as former model Cherri Gilham revealed recently in The Observer, she had already smoked pot with Lennon and McCartney in London. Myth: The woman in red on the cover of Bringing It All Back Home is really a man in drag. Fact: She is Sally Grossman, wife of Bob's manager Albert Grossman. The cuff links Dylan wears in the shot were given to him by Joan Baez, who years later mentioned them in her song, 'Diamonds and Rust'. Myth: Dylan has dozens of love children. Fact: Dylan has claimed that 'many women in the world have my children', but there are only known to be seven; five with his wife Sara and two others since by now-departed lovers. Fact: 'Bob Dylan knows all the secrets of the universe - but he ain't telling.' Caption to a late 1960s Robert Crumb cartoon.",

An innovative rights issue of shares in BT Wireless - the mobile arm which owns Cellnet - is also being considered among the options to cut BT's \u00a332 billion debt mountain, The Observer has established. BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance and chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield have so far resisted pressure to quit as the price of a financial rescue by City institutions. Non-executive director Tony Greener, ex-head of drinks giant Diageo, is one choice as a new chairman by City investors keen to see Vallance go first. Former Orange boss Hans Snook is also favoured as a chief executive. BT's debt has ballooned following the huge cost of new mobile licences, acquisitions and capital investment. Market conditions have forced it to postpone flotations of BT Wireless and Yellow Pages, plus non-core asset sales, to cut borrowings by \u00a310bn this year. This weekend BT declined to comment on its next move. 'There are no imminent announcements, nor summary judgments of management,' a BT spokesman said. On Friday, a senior BT executive in Tokyo was non-committal about the firm's future in Japan. This weekend, however, City sources close to BT confirmed that the group's 20 per cent stakes in Japan Telecom and J-Phone, its mobile arm, were up for grabs. Also on the block are BT's stakes in Cegetel in France and Airtel in Spain, which it had previously intended to keep. BT is also now in talks with buyers for Yell, the Yellow Pages arm, sources said. The group's 21.9p dividend absorbed \u00a31.4bn last year. BT has already kept its interim payout at 8.7p this year, at a cost of \u00a3570m. Maintaining the final dividend at 13.2p would cost a further \u00a3860m. 'BT will only discuss all the options at its board meeting in April,' one source said. 'But to make any meaningful difference, the final dividend payout would have to be cut by at least half.' The line on BT? It'll cost you...",

Driving with a safety belt does not guarantee protection in the event of an accident and in some cases may be even be a disadvantage because it may trap the driver inside the car. But usually it is safer to drive wearing a safety belt than not.</p> <p>Other examples spring readily to mind. The common theme is that most of the time, the outcomes are happy ones. But the probability of an unhappy one rises in certain circumstances. This is exactly the case with family structure. Marriage remains a valuable institution, for the individuals concerned, for their children, and for society as a whole. The empirical evidence is now overwhelmingly in support of all three of these propositions.</p> <p>It is now clear that children brought up in a stable, two-parent family as a rule do better than in other family types. This is true for almost every indicator used to measure their personal development. Family break-up often damages children, even when it makes one or both of their parents happier. To give just one example, boys living with both natural parents are less likely to commit crime than if they are brought up by a lone parent or in a step-family. Here are some of the ways in which research shows marriage to be beneficial.</p> <p>On average, married people are physically healthier and have lower mortality rates than single, cohabiting, divorced or separated people. They live more regular and secure lives, and engage in less substance abuse and other harmful activities. They suffer from less anxiety, depression, and other mental ailments. These findings apply to both sexes. In 1972, the American Jesse Barnard claimed that 'marriage may be hazardous to women's health'. It is true that men gain most from marriage, but the modern evidence indicates that in general, women benefit. Married women engage in fewer risky forms of behaviour than single or divorced women, and they receive more financial and emotional support than other women. They are less likely to become disabled in old age or enter a nursing home, they live longer and are less likely to commit suicide. They also report higher levels of emotional satisfaction with their primary partner than cohabiting or other women. And serious violence among married couples is uncommon, while violence of all kinds is much less frequent than among cohabiting couples.</p> <p>Both physical and sexual abuse are much less frequent for children who live with their married, biological parents than in other kinds of family set-up. By far the riskiest situation for a child is to live in a step-family. And marriages are on average more stable than cohabiting unions. This applies whether or not children are present. The instability of cohabiting unions is to be expected since many of them involve no lifelong commitment and the option of breaking up is consciously preserved.</p> <p>Married men work harder, earn more and are more likely to have a job than other men. Their stable families create a network of reciprocal obligations between generations, siblings and spouses. Despite the growth of nursing homes and social services, care for old or sick adults in our society is mainly the responsibility of close relatives. Friends and neighbours hardly figure. Modern family trends mean that millions of extra men and women in the future will have no close relative prepared to care for them in sickness or old age. On every measure of achievement and emotional condition, children living with their married parents usually do better than other children. This applies to both adopted and biological children. The children of lone parents on average perform less well on all measures than those with married parents. Part of this gap is explained by the fact that lone parents as a group are relatively poor, but much of it is due to other disadvantages associated with lone parenthood.</p> <p>Although divorce can be beneficial to children in the case of severe parental conflict, it frequently damages children emotionally and harms their future life chances. The conventional view at one time was that parents should normally stick together for the sake of the children even if one or both of them was unhappy. For decades this view was criticised by therapeutic professionals who claimed that children are better off if unhappy parents separate</p> <p>But the traditional view was usually right. Only in high conflict families - a distinct minority of cases - is divorce on average better for the children. The worst situation for children is to be in a continuing high-conflict marriage or in a low-conflict marriage that ends in divorce. Another debilitating aspect of marriage break up, and of lone parenthood in general, is its impact on family finances. Lone parenthood is a powerful cause of poverty. The stereotype, of course, is the 19-year-old semi-literate mother of two children by separate fathers living in a tower block. Most lone parents are not of this type, but it is universally true that lone parenthood greatly increases the chances of a family ending up in poverty.</p> <p>All these various findings refer to averages and may not apply in individual cases. Thus, some cohabiting unions are very successful, some divorces may be good for the children, and many lone parents and step-families bring up their children well. But despite these caveats, the scientific evidence in favour of marriage as an institution is now overwhelming. There can be no doubt that, generally, marriage is superior to other family types.</p> <p>None of this implies a holier-than-thou morality. What goes on behind the net curtains to preserve marriage is not our concern. Support for marriage is based on its practical benefits to both individuals and society.

They flowed from the disenchantment of the old Left and cynicism among the young about politics itself.</p> <p>In Scotland, we run a particular risk of overdosing on elections. Gerry Hassan, co-author of The Almanac of Scottish Politics (Politicos), pointed out last week that Scotland has a new expanded political class, consisting of 209 national representatives (MPs, MSPs and MEPs). Take a stroll down the High Street in Edinburgh on a day Parliament is sitting and you will soon meet members of this new \u00e9lite. They wear a purposeful air and have a mobile phone clamped to their ear.</p> <p>Signs of satiation with politics emerged in the low turnout at the local elections. But Labour's hegemony has more active opponents than simple apathy. It is under attack by an SNP which, Hassan noted, has turned itself into a traditional social democratic party, supporting every demand for extra public spending.</p> <p>This munificent message plays well not just in the scrappy little towns of old industrial Scotland but also in the fishing communities tied up in enforced idleness and on the farm lands lambent with animal pyres.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats, having taken the soup in the coalition, face being squeezed not just by the Nats but also by the Tories, though it is a curiosity of modern Scottish politics that the Conservative Party, which once ruled the roost in the deferential countryside, now is very much a party of urban man. Leader David McLetchie and sidekicks like Brian Monteith are the very personification of what the French call the 'bobo' - or 'bourgeois bohemian'.</p> <p>If Scotland is beginning to have problems with its electoral digestive system, England is unlikely to be far behind. We already have an elected mayor in London but in the next Parliament, if Labour is elected, we shall almost certainly see a strengthening of regional political consciousness. Gordon Brown has promised more resources for regional development agencies. And although regional 'nationalism' is still feeble, a campaign to stimulate it is gathering pace. Last week the Campaign for the English Regions published an advertisement in the Guardian demanding legislation for English devolution in the next Parliament.</p> <p>It is only a matter of time, too, before the Scottish Office is subsumed into a new department for constitutional affairs. A report in the Herald last week that the days of Dover House as the Scottish bastion in Whitehall are almost over was quickly denied. But it remains a credible notion.</p> <p>In the hydra-headed world of our new politics, the Prime Minister must be careful not to vex the country with an election many will regard as otiose, inappropriate and an irresponsible divergence from the higher tasks of government.</p>",

Gerry Hassan, co-author of The Almanac of Scottish Politics (Politicos), pointed out last week that Scotland has a new expanded political class, consisting of 209 national representatives (MPs, MSPs and MEPs). Take a stroll down the High Street in Edinburgh on a day Parliament is sitting and you will soon meet members of this new \u00e9lite. They wear a purposeful air and have a mobile phone clamped to their ear. Signs of satiation with politics emerged in the low turnout at the local elections. But Labour's hegemony has more active opponents than simple apathy. It is under attack by an SNP which, Hassan noted, has turned itself into a traditional social democratic party, supporting every demand for extra public spending. This munificent message plays well not just in the scrappy little towns of old industrial Scotland but also in the fishing communities tied up in enforced idleness and on the farm lands lambent with animal pyres. The Liberal Democrats, having taken the soup in the coalition, face being squeezed not just by the Nats but also by the Tories, though it is a curiosity of modern Scottish politics that the Conservative Party, which once ruled the roost in the deferential countryside, now is very much a party of urban man. Leader David McLetchie and sidekicks like Brian Monteith are the very personification of what the French call the 'bobo' - or 'bourgeois bohemian'. If Scotland is beginning to have problems with its electoral digestive system, England is unlikely to be far behind. We already have an elected mayor in London but in the next Parliament, if Labour is elected, we shall almost certainly see a strengthening of regional political consciousness. Gordon Brown has promised more resources for regional development agencies. And although regional 'nationalism' is still feeble, a campaign to stimulate it is gathering pace. Last week the Campaign for the English Regions published an advertisement in the Guardian demanding legislation for English devolution in the next Parliament. It is only a matter of time, too, before the Scottish Office is subsumed into a new department for constitutional affairs. A report in the Herald last week that the days of Dover House as the Scottish bastion in Whitehall are almost over was quickly denied. But it remains a credible notion. In the hydra-headed world of our new politics, the Prime Minister must be careful not to vex the country with an election many will regard as otiose, inappropriate and an irresponsible divergence from the higher tasks of government.",

I even heard Hague calling today for us to begin 'slaughtering on suspicion' but it's OK, Jack reassures me, he only meant asylum-seekers. <p>Speaking of whom, Jack's been playing a blinder. Latest musings apparently include a brilliant strategy to get us out of the foot and mouth election mess by getting the Army - and why is it, by the way, that so many of Our Brave Falklands Boys' exercises over the past 20 years have had such a strong recurring sheep motif? - to supervise the election itself, visiting houses throughout the land, advising who can vote and who must stay at home and who must be locked up in a vat of disinfectant etc. Quiet murmurs of jealous congratulation from the usual suspects - Alastair, Thatcher, Bush, Pinochet and the rest. </p> <p> <b> Tuesday</b> <br><br>More ethical dilemmas for poor Tony; terrible torn arguments over whether we should, as an allegedly tolerant nation, be feeling genuine remorse for the misbegotten beasts, all helpless and lank and covered in sad cowshit and misery through this endless wet March, or view them, with Darwinian enlightenment, as inevitable historical victims. </p> <p>Finally, tolerance wins. He'll still speak to the farmers' spokesmen. </p> <p> <b>Wednesday</b><br><br> A mild sense of shock that the Mail hasn't used the Mir story to turn the paper into a 'The Sky Is Falling' special. Perhaps they've been distracted by the shock of winning Newspaper of the Year: same sense of shock, presumably, that poleaxed Kissinger when he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, or Hague when he was nominated for birth. </p> <p> <b> Thurday</b><br><br> Rather embarrassing for Tony, being caught out on camera like that telling election secrets to Prodi that he doesn't even tell to, for example, his own bloody wife. But it could have been worse; at least the mike didn't pick up the two of them rocking with laughter as he added: 'Still, at least I've shafted Kennedy!' </p> <p> <b> Friday</b><br><br> It took young Kathryn to offer up the most poignant question of all, when she asked what the sheep must feel as they watch politicians arguing over their future to score points before the election - her words, but still. </p> <p>Perhaps it's this gloomy, cynical March, but I find myself drawn to answer through literature. Wasn't there some famous closing passage about sheep? 'An uproar of voices was coming from the farmhouse. They rushed back and looked through the window again. Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Monday Slightly surprised, frankly, that it's taken so long for us all to switch from good old British rational inaction to good new British absurd Draconian over-reaction, with each side vying to come up with the most ludicrously Grand Guignol endgame. I even heard Hague calling today for us to begin 'slaughtering on suspicion' but it's OK, Jack reassures me, he only meant asylum-seekers. Speaking of whom, Jack's been playing a blinder. Latest musings apparently include a brilliant strategy to get us out of the foot and mouth election mess by getting the Army - and why is it, by the way, that so many of Our Brave Falklands Boys' exercises over the past 20 years have had such a strong recurring sheep motif? - to supervise the election itself, visiting houses throughout the land, advising who can vote and who must stay at home and who must be locked up in a vat of disinfectant etc. Quiet murmurs of jealous congratulation from the usual suspects - Alastair, Thatcher, Bush, Pinochet and the rest. Tuesday More ethical dilemmas for poor Tony; terrible torn arguments over whether we should, as an allegedly tolerant nation, be feeling genuine remorse for the misbegotten beasts, all helpless and lank and covered in sad cowshit and misery through this endless wet March, or view them, with Darwinian enlightenment, as inevitable historical victims. Finally, tolerance wins. He'll still speak to the farmers' spokesmen. Wednesday A mild sense of shock that the Mail hasn't used the Mir story to turn the paper into a 'The Sky Is Falling' special. Perhaps they've been distracted by the shock of winning Newspaper of the Year: same sense of shock, presumably, that poleaxed Kissinger when he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, or Hague when he was nominated for birth. Thurday Rather embarrassing for Tony, being caught out on camera like that telling election secrets to Prodi that he doesn't even tell to, for example, his own bloody wife. But it could have been worse; at least the mike didn't pick up the two of them rocking with laughter as he added: 'Still, at least I've shafted Kennedy!' Friday It took young Kathryn to offer up the most poignant question of all, when she asked what the sheep must feel as they watch politicians arguing over their future to score points before the election - her words, but still. Perhaps it's this gloomy, cynical March, but I find myself drawn to answer through literature. Wasn't there some famous closing passage about sheep? 'An uproar of voices was coming from the farmhouse. They rushed back and looked through the window again. Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.'",

Record numbers of us play the game of 10-pins today - indeed, more Americans bowl than vote - but organised bowling in leagues has plunged by two-thirds in the last quarter of a century. Vanishing bowling leagues are a metaphor for disappearing civic togetherness as measured by virtually all indicators, formal and informal, high-minded and casual, public and private.</p> <p>Americans today are far less likely to participate in community meetings, join local organisations, attend church, vote, contribute to charities or fulfil other civic responsibilities than we were just a few decades ago. Compared to our parents' generation, we are less likely to know our neighbours, to invite friends home, to go on picnics or hang out in bars, to belong to trade unions and professional associations or simply to spend time chatting with acquaintances.</p> <p>Even within the family circle, social isolation is growing. Families are about a third less likely to eat dinner together, take holidays together or even to watch television together. Not surprisingly, as our connections with one another have declined, so too has our trust in one another. We are losing an essential lubricant for social co-operation.</p> <p>So what? Is concern about fading togetherness simply a faddish form of nostalgia? Emphatically not. A vast and growing range of evidence from around the world shows that social connections - social capital - have measurable value. Communities with more social capital have lower crime rates and more effective schools. Children in such communities are at lower risk of teen pregnancy, child abuse, drug use or juvenile delinquency. Citizens in high social-capital communities enjoy more responsive, honest and efficient government and are, in turn, more likely to pay taxes and fulfil other civic obligations.</p> <p>And connected people live longer, happier lives. Money can buy a bit of happiness, the evidence suggests, but active participation in even a single community group is the 'happiness equivalent' of doubling your annual income.</p> <p>Is 'bowling alone' a uniquely American malady or are there similar trends in other countries? The verdict on that question is not yet in and the evidence so far is equivocal. There isn't a single global metronome ticking off simultaneous rhythms of social capital change everywhere. On the other hand, some evidence suggests that Europe may be about to follow the American pattern with a lag of a few decades. Europe may have a social capital 'cold', but not yet the full-blown American pneumonia.</p> <p>In virtually all industrialised nations, political parties, unions and churches have experienced declining participation over the last decade or two, roughly 20 years after the comparable American slumps began. Electoral turnout is down in almost all established democracies. Over the last generation, when increasing levels of education should have prompted large increases in voting, turnout in the developed nations has slumped by up to 20 per cent. Membership of political parties has declined by almost two-thirds in the last few decades.</p> <p>With the exception of Scandinavia, these same countries have experienced drops of more than one-third in union membership in the last two decades. Across Europe, church attendance has been nearly halved since 1970. And in the UK, these declines in social participation have been accompanied by a decline in trust in other people, perhaps the most sensitive indicator of social capital.</p> <p>Evidence of civic engagement in Britain and the rest of Europe is not so dire and unambiguous as in the US. Some grassroots social and political groups seem to be growing here. Nevertheless, emptying polling booths, withering party membership, fading unions and vacant pews are worrying, because places of worship, unions and political parties have been important training grounds for civic skills and leadership among our countries' less affluent citizens.</p> <p>The last time that many countries faced a social-capital crisis of this magnitude was in the Industrial Revolution's aftermath. In the US at the end of the nineteenth century (and several decades earlier in the UK), as people migrated from villages to factory towns, they left friends and community ties behind. The result was a weakening of community bonds, a social-capital deficit.</p> <p>But then, in a burst of social creativity, a remarkable generation of social reformers invented new forms of social connection that fitted the way we had come to live. The UK, first to experience the social dislocation of the Industrial Revolution, was the first to begin to develop new forms of social capital. Many of the institutions invented by mid-Victorian social reformers to restore community bonds - the Salvation Army, unions, settlement houses, friendly societies - were then eagerly adopted a few decades later by US social entrepreneurs to address our own developing social-capital crisis.</p> <p>This time around, the social-capital crisis seems to be hitting America earlier and harder, probably because some of the underlying causes of the decline - suburbanisation, two-career families - emerged in our country several decades earlier than elsewhere. If the UK and Europe are lucky, you may escape our problems, but if not, you may want to learn from our efforts to find solutions.</p> <p>First, government must play a role. Big government can sometimes erode social capital, but I reject the simple-minded view that the state is intrinsically the enemy of civil society. Just as governments routinely evaluate policies for their impact on the physical environment, a bipartisan reform group in the US has recently recommended the use of a 'social-capital impact statement' to warn of policies that could damage community bonds. Government decision-making should be pushed downward. Strategies that devolve real decision-making to the neighbourhood level have proven effective. 'Smart growth' strategies to curtail suburban sprawl not only reduce air pollution, but also enable workers to spend more time with family and friends.</p> <p>Since the decline in civic engagement is particularly marked in the younger generation, we need to take more seriously our obligation to educate youth in civic responsibilities. We already know some educational policies that will work. Smaller schools, more extracurricular activities, enlivened civic education and community service requirements have all been shown to encourage broader civic engagement by young people.</p> <p>Religious communities have great potential to enhance civic life. For that reason, from the progressive side of the political spectrum, I welcome President Bush's new initiative to support faith-based social-action programmes. Faith-based organisations have a proven ability to reweave the fabric of distressed communities and they deserve support from government and foundations.</p> <p>Finally, we need greater workplace flexibility to allow employees to reconcile the conflicting demands of work, family and community. In a world in which virtually all adults work outside the home, we have drastically 'downsized' the unpaid caring sector of our society. Both mums and dads need flexibility in their work life, so that family and community obligations do not go unmet. Smart firms will adopt flexible policies to attract top talent. Europe is ahead of the US in this area and we should learn from your innovations.</p> <p>Regardless of who imports what ideas from whom, we have a lot to learn from one another in our common quest to avert this crisis of community.</p> <p>\u0095 Robert D.

      "body": "<p>When I arrived in Britain 20 years ago, money was grubby. After a middle class up-bringing in openly materialist America, I was shocked at how the upper classes here were coy about their wealth, and camouflaged it with their frayed shirt collars, beaten-up Minis and draughty homes. The working class and the left-wing intelligentsia, meanwhile, badmouthed prosperity with the words they inherited from the Methodists who had taught that money was the root of all evil, while the Marxists portrayed it as the means with which the capitalists oppressed the proletariat.</p> <p>Today, all that is gone. Money is respectable; and wealth is universally regarded as a good thing. The affluent don't want to hide their prosperity - quite the opposite. Banks propose to give two-tier customer services - so that the very wealthy can bear a card that proclaims them as special. Fashion trends from Burberry plaid to pashminas ensure that consumers can be conspicuous in their consumption. And even if today's rich folk buy their food from Tesco, they want it delivered incognito, in nameless green Land Rovers that won't let the neighbours in on the secret of their humble purveyors.</p> <p>Money came out of the closet during the Thatcher years. But what is different about today's climate is that the Left too is peeling the stigma from wealth. It is Tony Blair who alerted us to this sea-change. In a candid interview last week, the Prime Minister spoke of the many friends from school and university who had 'ended up so rich'. The sigh of envy was unspoken but understood - and it liberated Labour from a lingering guilt about being or even wanting to be rich.</p> <p>Blair's admission could never have been uttered by a Neil Kinnock - or indeed any Labour leader before him. Politicians of the Left traditionally condemned money as the oil that made the shameful Tory machine work: brown envelopes and cash for questions. Today, half of the political establishment is well-paid lawyers - and the other half is married to them. Everybody at those Millbank drinks parties speaks of a second home and prattles knowledgeably about stocks and shares.</p> <p>Beyond Westminster, too, the Left no longer automatically suspects those who try to attain it. They have even debunked the cherished myth, peddled by Christians, Socialists and Christian Socialists above all, that poverty is morally superior to wealth. Blessed were the poor, for their pitiful conditions ensured their goodness and worth, not to mention a passport to heaven. Such condescending claptrap kept millions trapped in grinding poverty: Jesus meant well, but they'd like to stop starving and freezing right there and then, thank you. They saw their economic difficulties as more oppressive and corrosive than any fat-cat boss.

      "bodyText": "When I arrived in Britain 20 years ago, money was grubby. After a middle class up-bringing in openly materialist America, I was shocked at how the upper classes here were coy about their wealth, and camouflaged it with their frayed shirt collars, beaten-up Minis and draughty homes. The working class and the left-wing intelligentsia, meanwhile, badmouthed prosperity with the words they inherited from the Methodists who had taught that money was the root of all evil, while the Marxists portrayed it as the means with which the capitalists oppressed the proletariat. Today, all that is gone. Money is respectable; and wealth is universally regarded as a good thing. The affluent don't want to hide their prosperity - quite the opposite. Banks propose to give two-tier customer services - so that the very wealthy can bear a card that proclaims them as special. Fashion trends from Burberry plaid to pashminas ensure that consumers can be conspicuous in their consumption. And even if today's rich folk buy their food from Tesco, they want it delivered incognito, in nameless green Land Rovers that won't let the neighbours in on the secret of their humble purveyors. Money came out of the closet during the Thatcher years. But what is different about today's climate is that the Left too is peeling the stigma from wealth. It is Tony Blair who alerted us to this sea-change. In a candid interview last week, the Prime Minister spoke of the many friends from school and university who had 'ended up so rich'. The sigh of envy was unspoken but understood - and it liberated Labour from a lingering guilt about being or even wanting to be rich. Blair's admission could never have been uttered by a Neil Kinnock - or indeed any Labour leader before him. Politicians of the Left traditionally condemned money as the oil that made the shameful Tory machine work: brown envelopes and cash for questions. Today, half of the political establishment is well-paid lawyers - and the other half is married to them. Everybody at those Millbank drinks parties speaks of a second home and prattles knowledgeably about stocks and shares. Beyond Westminster, too, the Left no longer automatically suspects those who try to attain it. They have even debunked the cherished myth, peddled by Christians, Socialists and Christian Socialists above all, that poverty is morally superior to wealth. Blessed were the poor, for their pitiful conditions ensured their goodness and worth, not to mention a passport to heaven. Such condescending claptrap kept millions trapped in grinding poverty: Jesus meant well, but they'd like to stop starving and freezing right there and then, thank you. They saw their economic difficulties as more oppressive and corrosive than any fat-cat boss. They recognised that hunger and being unable to clothe your freezing children, far from promoting goodness, gnaws the body and soul with temptations to break the law, bully someone more vulnerable and prejudice the course of justice. Money, too, can hold out temptation: it can cocoon you from the plight of others, and the instant satisfaction of possessions can inspire a Gordon Gekko greed for more and more. But, on the whole, the rich make our society infinitely better. Those who want to accumulate wealth have to deploy their talents, channel their energies and unfurl their imagination - thereby setting new frontiers in every field. Economic competitiveness, almost as much as ambition, has men and women sweating over the design for a more powerful and cheaper car, or the script for a more entertaining television series; and the rest of us benefit. Rich money may not always trickle down to the rest of us, as politicians like to promise, but we can borrow it. Even in the wake of the IT debacle that turned investors into debtors almost overnight, there are banks that boast the savings of the rich, which they will recycle as loans to enterprises that invest in more equipment, more space - and more jobs for the rest of us. The purchasing power of the prosperous translates into more, and more affordable, choice for all of us. From the 20-pence kiwi fruit to the \u00a35 Hong Kong knock-off of a Gucci key chain, the poor of today have more access to more material goods. The well-off may have joined the rest of us in deserting the boy scouts, church choirs and bowling leagues that forge the social connections that make up civic life; but there are plenty of rich with a social conscience - from the lawyer who takes on pro bono cases to the philanthropists who build schools and fund art grants, to the Sloane who organises a charity ball. Collectively, these individuals can look above the grinding concern of where their next meal will come from to the soaring ideals that are the trademarks of progress - social justice, equal rights. Most may not want to concern themselves with fighting pay discrimination or racially motivated crime, but when they do they have the leisure with which to champion these ideas in public and private debates, so that they become everyday currency - even, sometimes, laws - rather than academic theory.

'We were at Bournemouth, demonstrating outside the Labour conference there, and he had set off walking downhill from his farm some time before dawn.</p> <p>'He didn't seem to know quite where he was. But then as the last delegates were going in, he pushed to the railing and said to a woman in his quiet voice: \"Will you not help us?\" And she just said: \"You didn't turn out for the miners, did you?\" And she walked on and that was it.'</p> <p>In every British heart these days, there is a cold spot for the farmers. Well, almost every heart, subtracting the 250,000 surviving farmers and their families, plus those who live on the land and from the land in other ways.</p> <p>The cold spot in the heart is as widespread as the sore place in the hoof or the slaver at the muzzle. But it has been there - it is now clear - for far longer than this foot and mouth pandemic.</p> <p>The farmer's wife and her husband David have watched this coldness spreading for many years. They are tenant farmers with 300 acres of fine, chalky Dorset earth, working another 100 acres on contract. They do malting barley and seed wheat, but milk is the thing: 75 meltingly beautiful Guernsey cows with silky ginger topknots and trustful natures. The herd goes back to 1922. The family knows each cow.</p> <p>The nearest virus outbreak is still 20 miles away, but it's blowing in the wind. The farmer's wife, who is a Scot, said: 'The first week after it started was like Passover in Egypt. The angel moving at nights from door to door, smearing some with blood. I lay awake, listening.' She laughed grimly, and she and her husband knocked on the table for luck.</p> <p>'WHAT THEY breed is diseases, not food,' said the London social worker, sheltering in the newsagent's from the rain. 'It's BSE and E. coli and listeria in eggs, and now this. And the way they breed chickens and pigs, it's like a well, Auschwitz or something, out there. And the whole farming business is just totally unreal, with us paying subsidies for stuff nobody wants, produced in sick conditions and screwing up the environment. It's the farmers who are past their sell-by date.'</p> <p>The coldness has spread through England, through the cities and large towns where almost everyone lives. Until now, no Government dared to exploit it. But a torrent of anti-farmer articles and columns began to flow about six weeks ago. They are close to the view of farming entertained at 10 Downing Street. Pretty certainly, some of the articles were prompted there.</p> <p>'Sorry about the families among the shots and the pyres', the message goes. 'But not sorry for farmers as such. They are living off public funds to which sink estates, bad schools and crowded wards have a far better claim. Their numbers are tiny, their output insignificant and flaky - and now they are poisoning the tourist trade! Farmers, you have finally run out of rope!'</p> <p>Where did it go, that rosy English vision of the farmer and his virtues, of the farmyard and its wholesome produce? And when did it start fading away? David, the Dorset farmer, thinks that it was in the 1970s. 'There were the rich farmers showing off in their big Land-Rovers, and the public were told that we were being feather-bedded. That's when it started going sour, and when farming got unpopular.'</p> <p>Town and country have never got along, in England or anywhere else. But the English experience was - as usual - different to that of continental nations. England began to destroy its peasantry 400 years ago, long before any other European country did so. For the past few centuries, the classes of England's countryside were landlord, tenant farmer and landless labourer. So town attitudes to country in England were unlike attitudes in nations - France, Italy, Poland - where the post-feudal countryside was held by millions of independent small peasants.The peasants were crude, but they were big stakeholders in the nationalism stakes. The Polish peasants' motto was 'We Nourish, We Defend'. They grew the nation's bread and meat and they fought for its independence with their scythes.</p> <p>Urban people, all the same, were not romantic about peasants. Too many of them, especially as the industrial revolution began to swell the cities, had been born on small farms themselves. As a Polish friend remembers, 'it was up before dawn, chilblains, and father with a big stick'. And politics divided town and country, as they still do. French intellectuals traditionally see peasants as dirty, ignorant, violent, superstitious, anti-semitic and addicted to ultra-right demagogues. During the Commune of 1871, the workers of Red Paris fought it out with the White armies of the Catholic peasantry - and lost.</p> <p>But English townies, with no peasantry left, could afford to be friendly. After all, the landed gentry trundling up from the sticks in their coaches were their best customers. And the tenant farmers were perceived as the backbone of England. Not only did they grow food, they paid the rents which kept up the gentry's purchasing power and provided - even less willingly - the soldiers and sailors who could give the French and Spaniards a drubbing. As for the farm labourers and their families, nobody in town paid attention to them until they started burning ricks. Then the gallows and transportation took care of them.</p> <p>So England stayed fond of its farmers, and sentimental about rural life. (Scotland was different: by 1900, most town-dwellers had country roots and knew all too much about Highland and Lowland landlords). The fondness survived the Depression of the 1930s and the sensational boost given to farming in the Second World War. But then the mood changed.</p> <p>David in Dorset said it was the Common Agricultural Policy that did it. A discreet British subsidy system was replaced by a glaringly prominent European one, benefiting the big cereal farmers who were already rich. Then came the plague years, starting with BSE.</p> <p>As the Countryside Alliance gloomily remarked last year, 'the culture of government has been urban for a long time... the myth of a wealthy and over-subsidised countryside lives on...' Average farm incomes have plunged by 90 per cent since 1995 (though they had doubled in the previous five years). Disastrously, the alliance had built its initial campaign around the threat to hunting, the one issue guaranteed to slam urban minds shut. Four farmers I spoke to - all in hunting shires - agreed that 'whipping hunting into the farming question' had been a bad mistake.</p> <p>So what is to be done with the countryside? 'Set-aside' is already an institution; David is paid \u00a390 an acre to leave 10 per cent of his fields uncultivated. But the slide goes on. 'I have lost money for two years and the bleeding has to stop; I have to take desperate measures this year. We are strung up by the supermarkets who screw us to the last drop; they now buy my Guernsey milk at only 19p a litre - and sell it at 50p a pint!'</p> <p>He wonders about going organic - but the government conversion fund has run out of cash already. Maybe the country should become one huge National Park, he says, and farmers should turn into park-keepers and clip the hedges for the incomers.</p> <p>But if the farmers give up their fields, the Green dream of an England peacefully reverting to oak forest is not what will happen. Instead, a different tribe will move in and take over, looking for somewhere to garden, run a business or simply live.</p> <p>It has happened so often in the English past. William Cobbett, writing in the 1820s, moaned about rural incomers. An old 'native' gentry attached to the soil was being pushed out by a new, weekending gentry 'viewing [the soil] as a mere object of speculation'. They were 'nabobs, negro-drivers, generals, admirals, governors, commissaries, contractors, pensioners... lottery dealers, bankers, stock-jobbers; not to mention the long and black list in gowns and three-tailed wigs'</p> <p>This next invasion will be far more than a commuter group. The historian Professor Eric Hobsbawm told me: 'There will be a new kind of country person. They will identify with parts of it, city people who prefer to regard themselves as country people, but who will enjoy the enormous acreage of the place without being one or the other.'</p> <p>The newcomers would be very white, he said. This chimes in with the Countryside Alliance study of migration into a Wiltshire village, where the top third now earn more than \u00a340,000 a year while the bottom third earn less than \u00a36,000. David says: 'Ninety per cent of them desperately want to be part of the countryside. But how can farmers rate as feather-bedded when people from London are running a country home on \u00a3120,000 a year? I wonder: why not go and be a bus driver?'</p> <p>The tenant farmers were supposed to be the backbone of England. But England does not want a backbone any more. The subsidies, British or European, were meant not just to pad out incomes but to help people - farmers, peasants, crofters - to go on living in their native landscapes. But the free market hates the very idea of native roots.</p> <p>Sometimes David reckons the farming game is up. 'We lived in a fool's paradise, not the real world, I admit that.' Then, looking at his rampart of feed for the Guernseys, he adds: 'It's hard and grim. But the sun comes out, and there's always something about it worthwhile.'</p>",

Russell, who has bitterly opposed former Minister Sam Galbraith's decision to approve a \u00a31.9 million grant to secure the Glasgow-based company's future, told The Observer it was 'time to face harsh economic and cultural realities'. The nationalists' move will reignite the bitter row over the future of Scottish Opera which broke out last week when SNP MSPs claimed that the announcement of the grant was rushed through before Galbraith resigned on health grounds. In an interview with The Observer Russell said: 'We are happy to support publicly funded arts, from traditional Scottish arts and music to opera, but there has to be a balance. When it comes to Scottish Opera, if it cannot survive on the \u00a36.5m a year it receives from the taxpayer, we cannot afford it. That is the harsh reality.' The SNP did not want to deprive audiences of opera. It could be staged in new ways, he said, and one possibility was a merger of Scottish Opera with a company south of the border. 'There are a number of options. One is to merge with Opera North or Welsh Opera. The second is to take the money and pay for visiting opera companies to come to Scotland to perform and do community projects, and to put some money aside to train Scottish performers.' The decision to award extra cash to Scottish Opera when farmers were demanding compensation for the foot and mouth epidemic and the fishing industry was in crisis was bringing the public funding process into disrepute, Russell said. 'How can politicians say to hard-pressed groups anywhere in the community that they cannot help with extra cash and then give an arts group a couple of million pounds that they have not asked for? People will simply see that as unfair.' Scottish Opera said it could not comment on the SNP's move, but an official referred critics to a statement issued by the company on Friday.

      "bodyText": "British troops serving in Kosovo will be deployed to seal the Kosovo-Macedonian border in a move that could bring them into the firing line of the three-week-old Albanian rebellion. The announcement, by Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, is certain to fuel fears that British troops are in danger of being sucked into fighting in the escalating crisis. Macedonian police and the Albanian National Liberation Army are fighting for control of Macedonia's second city, Tetovo, and the mountainous northern border area. According to Cook, British troops will take part in beefed-up border controls to help prevent arms being smuggled from Kosovo to the rebels. Cook was speaking after talks between Tony Blair and Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski at the European Union summit in Stockholm. He said Trajkovski had been assured of Britain's 'partnership' in the fight against what he described as 'terrorists', who have sparked an insurgency around Tetovo and border villages over the past three weeks. The announcement came after a day of sporadic shelling and gunfire in Tetovo between Macedonian forces in the city and ethnic Albanian guerrillas in the surrounding hills. Despite claims by the Macedonian government to have pushed back the rebels, the Albanian insurgents - who claim to be fighting for equal rights in the former Yugoslav republic - man positions within 200 metres of Tetovo's outskirts. Yesterday four Macedonian civilians were injured in the Koltuk area of the city, close to the Albanian lines, when a mortar hit their house. Some senior Macedonian officials admit their forces, numbering some 12,000 soldiers and police, are incapable of ending the uprising. One told The Observer: 'We believe the Albanians could put 5,000 fighters under arms. We talk about removing them in a measured operation but in a week of shelling we have not claimed back a single metre, and there are fewer than 300 fighters. All we are doing is shelling empty hillsides.' Although Britain has no plans to send extra troops to the Balkans in response to an appeal from Nato secretary-general George Robertson, Cook suggested British contingents of the K-For peacekeeping force in Kosovo would be switched to border patrol duties. British troops in Kosovo have been operating in a similar role on the border with southern Serbia, where a similar insurgency in ethnic Albanian towns has been under way for almost a year.

      "bodyText": "Fresh allegations of murky dealings between the Hinduja brothers and Britain threaten to embarrass Ministers who helped them obtain their British passports. A former adviser to the Indian government has claimed that British Aerospace - the UK's largest defence contractor - paid commission to the Indian tycoons to fix a \u00a31bn arms deal with the Indian air force to sell them 66 Hawk jets. The accusations will be hugely embarrassing for BAe, which has been trying to distance itself from the Indian-born tycoons currently facing charges in India of taking millions of pounds in illegal kickbacks from another arms deal involving the Swedish arms group Bofors. According to Home Office documents, it was the brothers' fear of prosecution in India over this arms deal that led them to pressure senior politicians to help them win British citizenship. It was Peter Mandelson's interventions on behalf of the Hindujas that led to his resignation in January. Earlier this month Indian Defence Minister George Fernandes resigned following allegations of widespread corruption in the ministry, which rocked India's Hindu nationalist-led government. Last June, British Aerospace hosted a dinner for Fernandes at the Portland Hotel, where Fernandes sat between the company's two senior executives, chairman Sir Richard Evans and chief executive John Weston. Fernandes has been accused by political opponents of 'manipulating' the deal to procure the Hawks at the cost of better and cheaper alternatives, although his supporters claim he has done nothing wrong. Sources have, however, told The Observer that 'irregularities' have been discovered in the Hawk deal although it was not clear to what period this related to. BAe started negotiating with the Indian government more than a decade ago to sell the Hawk jets and was initially awarded the contract without any competition. Sources now claim that the contract is unlikely to be signed, which will be a bitter blow to BAe. Mohan Guruswamy, who was a special adviser to the Indian Finance Secretary Yashwant Sinha, told The Observer : 'An amount of 14 per cent of the entire value of the deal is being paid by British Aerospace to the Hinduja brothers or their front companies.' He also told The Observer that the company had refused to sign a legal document promising that no illegal commission had been paid to middlemen. The Indian press has been running stories of a 'Bofors-related arms agent' being active in the BAe contract and have been highly critical of the price the Indian Air Force is paying for the planes. While BAe has sold Hawks to Australia and South Africa for around \u00a312m per aircraft, the Indian government is being charged \u00a315m. The current political corruption scandal in India erupted after journalists from an Indian website posing as sales agents of a British company captured on camera politicians, senior army and civil service officials accepting bribes to facilitate the sale of a non-existent hand-held thermal imaging system to the army. A spokesman for BAe said: 'We have no connections with the Hindujas and always abide by the law in whatever country we do business in.' BAe has also been dragged into a political row in South Africa after allegations that senior officials in the ANC government siphoned off million of pounds in a \u00a31.5bn arms deal to supply 24 Hawk trainer aircraft and 38 Gripen fighters to the South African air force. This was one of BAe's biggest deals but it faces criticism in South Africa for wasting limited resources which could be used for education, housing and health provision. BAe has always denied wrongdoing, but the chairman of a South African parliamentary committee has called for an investigation into a \u00a3500,000 donation paid by the aerospace company to a charity linked to the ANC's military wing shortly after the Hawk deal was signed.",

      "body": "<p>We are witnessing the traditional fiction that nothing could be further from a Prime Minister's mind than the timing of the general election. It is a pantomime that Mr Blair's sole pre-occupation this weekend is the foot and mouth crisis.</p> <p>The truth is that New Labour pencilled in 3 May, the date of the local council elections, as a likely general election date at least 18 months ago. The legislative programme for this parliament is complete. The Government has been contemplating action for its hoped-for second term for at least six months. The poster sites are booked; the manifesto ready; Millbank fully staffed. All that is awaited is the formal nod.</p> <p>The question now is whether the Government should defer the election and so freeze the political life of the nation for up to a year - all because of the distress in some farming communities and the national pall of gloom that has descended. It is a sign of our febrile times that the question, posed in these terms, should be considered for a second.</p> <p>The arguments for lengthy deferral are specious. It is plainly not propitious to hold an election when the Government's own chief scientist predicts the epidemic will be at a peak. But there is no guarantee, given the momentum that has built up, that the disease will be under control until the autumn. The proposition that the wider economic and political life of the country should be held to ransom by a single small interest group, and one whose own practices have contributed to the spread of the disease, is outrageous.</p> <p>If the Ministry of Agriculture, whose case for abolition is now overwhelming, had acted with more expedition, then the Tories and the so-called rural interest would have had no apparent national mood to exploit in their self-serving campaign to defer a poll. That is why Conservative Central Office can hardly believe its luck. It can pursue naked party advantage cloaked in the mantle of democratic propriety. But the response should be that there is no practical obstacle to an election, even in affected rural areas.</p> <p>Local council elections are essential to the life of local democracy; the notion that they should be deferred as if the country faced invasion is a vast exaggeration of the threat that foot and mouth constitutes. A computer virus which disabled some of the country's computers would be seen for what it was; an unfortunate event that had to be dealt with. The same coolness and objectivity should be applied to the blight hitting agriculture, even though the economic impact is very much less.</p> <p>The only issue now is whether Labour should announce a pause until, say, the first week of June. It could use the next month to do everything in its power to get control of the disease, from pre-emptive culling and vaccination to making sure that elimination of infected herds takes place within 24 hours This is clearly not as risky a strategy as waiting until October, when the country might well be starting to feel a chill from the slowdowns in the Japanese and US economies. But delay until June is still pregnant with uncertainty. The risk is that deferral will simply validate unscrupulous Tory critics.</p> <p>The Government may suffer some harsh criticism on the day of its decision, but the momentum of an election campaign will soon take foot and mouth out of the headlines. The real issue of control of the disease is non-political. This week, Mr Blair must establish a credible crisis management unit that can control officials, vets and the army. What is happening to some farmers is very sad. But it is no reason to freeze the political process and condemn Britain to many more months of futile political manoeuvring while causing untold damage to other areas of the economy, such as tourism, which suffer from the blight of our appearing to be a nation in crisis. Let's for once have some straight talking about the timing of this election.</p>",

The truth is that New Labour pencilled in 3 May, the date of the local council elections, as a likely general election date at least 18 months ago. The legislative programme for this parliament is complete. The Government has been contemplating action for its hoped-for second term for at least six months. The poster sites are booked; the manifesto ready; Millbank fully staffed. All that is awaited is the formal nod. The question now is whether the Government should defer the election and so freeze the political life of the nation for up to a year - all because of the distress in some farming communities and the national pall of gloom that has descended. It is a sign of our febrile times that the question, posed in these terms, should be considered for a second. The arguments for lengthy deferral are specious. It is plainly not propitious to hold an election when the Government's own chief scientist predicts the epidemic will be at a peak. But there is no guarantee, given the momentum that has built up, that the disease will be under control until the autumn. The proposition that the wider economic and political life of the country should be held to ransom by a single small interest group, and one whose own practices have contributed to the spread of the disease, is outrageous. If the Ministry of Agriculture, whose case for abolition is now overwhelming, had acted with more expedition, then the Tories and the so-called rural interest would have had no apparent national mood to exploit in their self-serving campaign to defer a poll. That is why Conservative Central Office can hardly believe its luck. It can pursue naked party advantage cloaked in the mantle of democratic propriety. But the response should be that there is no practical obstacle to an election, even in affected rural areas. Local council elections are essential to the life of local democracy; the notion that they should be deferred as if the country faced invasion is a vast exaggeration of the threat that foot and mouth constitutes. A computer virus which disabled some of the country's computers would be seen for what it was; an unfortunate event that had to be dealt with. The same coolness and objectivity should be applied to the blight hitting agriculture, even though the economic impact is very much less. The only issue now is whether Labour should announce a pause until, say, the first week of June. It could use the next month to do everything in its power to get control of the disease, from pre-emptive culling and vaccination to making sure that elimination of infected herds takes place within 24 hours This is clearly not as risky a strategy as waiting until October, when the country might well be starting to feel a chill from the slowdowns in the Japanese and US economies. But delay until June is still pregnant with uncertainty. The risk is that deferral will simply validate unscrupulous Tory critics. The Government may suffer some harsh criticism on the day of its decision, but the momentum of an election campaign will soon take foot and mouth out of the headlines. The real issue of control of the disease is non-political. This week, Mr Blair must establish a credible crisis management unit that can control officials, vets and the army. What is happening to some farmers is very sad. But it is no reason to freeze the political process and condemn Britain to many more months of futile political manoeuvring while causing untold damage to other areas of the economy, such as tourism, which suffer from the blight of our appearing to be a nation in crisis. Let's for once have some straight talking about the timing of this election.",

In official speak it is known as the Cabinet Office Briefing Room. In Government shorthand it is Cobra. When the large doors to Cobra are unlocked, the telephones dusted down and the lights switched on, everyone in Whitehall knows that things are getting serious. At 8am on Monday the message came from Downing Street: could a Cobra team be assembled and senior Ministers and officials be called to a meeting?</p> <p>No 10 was concerned that the crisis in the countryside was not getting better but worse, that messages from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that the foot and mouth epidemic was under control were increasingly unbelievable and that if the situation was not taken by the throat in the next two weeks then the most important decision of the Prime Minister's career was in danger of being compromised.</p> <p>Tony Blair's historic second-term election was under threat.</p> <p>The launch of Cobra for the first time since the fuel crisis last year reveals the sense of panic gripping the heart of Government. The number of cases of foot and mouth show no sign of abating, 80,000 carcasses lie in the fields waiting to be burnt or are being piled onto smouldering funeral pyres, nearly 300,000 animals have been slaughtered, a further 130,000 are condemned, half of Britain's livestock is under threat and Government scientists have admitted they have no 'end prediction' about when the disease will be eradicated. Blair fears political meltdown.</p> <p>A month ago Nick Brown, the Agriculture Minister, was confidently predicting Maff's 'tough measures' would bring the crisis under control. By the end of last week he had to seek refuge in weasel words to hold the increasingly tatty line. 'When I say it is under control I am speaking in terms of control zones and control measures in place,' he said to a briefing of incredulous journalists. 'The phrase \"out of control\" implies we are beaten and the disease is being allowed to let rip.' The groans could be heard across Downing Street.</p> <p>Observer journalists have spent the past month investigating the cause of the outbreak and its rapid spread. Our inquiries have revealed an appalling tale of complacency, greed, lax enforcement of key regulations, maladministration and incompetence. Maff and Downing Street have clashed over tactics, expert advice on disease in animal feed has been ignored, the Ministry of Defence has been turned down by agriculture officials when offering extra resources, animal welfare issues have been short-circuited, Blair has demanded some 'bloody direction' from the people trying to control the disease. 'If you are facing a crisis the one department you don't want in charge is Maff,' said one senior Downing Street source. 'Things that should have happened, simply haven't.'</p> <p>Last Tuesday afternoon Ben Gill and Richard Macdonald arrived at the gates of Downing Street. The president and director general of the National Union of Farmers have been regular visitors to Tony Blair's study at No 10. The two men, with colleagues from Scotland and Wales, were ushered up the grand staircase to be greeted by the Prime Minister. In the background was Jonathan Powell, Blair's chief of staff and one of the most powerful men in Government. His presence was significant.</p> <p>Gill and Macdonald's message was bleak. The culling policy was failing. The disease was running out of control because of ridiculous delays between diagnosing the disease and killing the infected animals. Public perception of the crisis was becoming more and more negative. The Government needed to up its game.</p> <p>In a moment of sudden understanding, Blair realised what he was being told. If something did not change rapidly the support of the NFU would be withdrawn. 'The NFU were struggling to keep their members on board. Blair knew if they pulled out then the battle was all but lost,' said a key Government strategist. Blair nodded in tense agreement as criticism after criticism was listed in detail by Gill and Macdonald. 'Give me 48 hours,' Blair said.</p> <p>Immediately after the gloomy meeting Blair ordered Powell to become closely involved in the crisis. Brown and his colleagues at Maff were clearly not coping. Powell was ordered down to the Cobra room to start knocking heads together, and it was made clear Brown was no longer in charge. It was that or face the possibility of another fuel crisis and the resultant plunge in the polls, two weeks before the Prime Minister was going to call a general election.'Maff were not taking the difficult decisions,' the strategist said.</p> <p>Powell was shocked when he discovered what Maff was up to. Vets were waiting around between farm visits because after visiting an infected farm they had to wait four days before visiting another. Culls were delayed because vets had to supervise slaughterman. Carcasses were piling up. Powell said the rules had to be relaxed.</p> <p>Last Thursday morning Blair faced more bad news. He was briefed that three epidemiology reports which were going to be published on Friday would say the epidemic was out of control and the slaughter of half of Britain's livestock could not be ruled out. Every day of delay in killing animals meant the disease would spread by an extra 25 to 50 per cent.</p> <p>For 90 minutes before the weekly Cabinet gathering Blair and Brown held a tense meeting. Blair said the situation had to be taken 'by the scruff of the neck'. Maff was failing, the Government was starting to look rocky. Brown's car whisked him back to Maff's headquarters in Smith Square. There he met Brian Bender, the Permanent Secretary, Jim Scudamore, the Chief Vet, and Jenny Bacon, Maff's head of animal health. Results, he said, were what mattered now.</p> <p>Seven days ago 800 cows and 770 sheep were grazing in John Hall's rolling Lake District fields. Now they lie in six huge piles, rotting under rubber sheets, a few hundred yards from his farmhouse. He does not know when their cremation pyre will be built, much less lit. It could still be many days away.</p> <p>'This is the way it had to be,' he said. But it didn't. This weekend there is a growing realisation that Hall's fate, and that of so many farmers, was in fact avoidable. The foot and mouth outbreak need never have happened. And at its centre, in all the confusion about culls and eradication zones, is the dirty issue of pigswill.</p> <p>Pigswill is the cooked-up remains of hospital food, school dinners and other catering waste. It has been banned in Portugal and Luxembourg because of fears it leads to the spread of disease. Now it is being blamed for the British foot and mouth crisis.</p> <p>The disease was first spotted among sheep at an Essex abbatoir on 19 February. The virus was rapidly traced back to a pig farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall in Northumbria. There, it is thought, pigswill including contaminated pork had been fed to livestock.</p> <p>But we can reveal that the Government rejected advice from its own disease control advisory group - the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee - to outlaw the feeding of catering waste to pigs nearly three years ago. Instead Maff decided 'tighter regulation' should be imposed after its officials highlighted the potential cost to farmers of outlawing swill, although it is only fed to 82,000 pigs or 1.4 per cent of the overall herd. Processors and farmers were told to boil all swill for an hour to kill infections. But the new system was flawed.</p> <p>'The irony is that the cost to farming of a ban was thought to be prohibitive and politically problematic,' said one former Maff adviser. 'But if we'd outlawed it the current outbreak would never have happened.' Now the Government has finally moved, three years too late, to ban the feed.</p> <p>Trading standards officers say the use of unprocessed pig swill is almost certainly continuing among a minority of farmers. There have been at least four pigswill prosecutions in the past nine months.'It is putting the whole of the livestock community at risk. It is criminal,' said Tony Shore, a trading standards officer involved with one case.</p> <p>The swill issue is just one of a number of significant cracks in Maff's policy to control the disease. The variant of the virus affecting British livestock is called Type O Pan Asian. It has reached Britain after a decade's journey via south Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Last November Swaziland and south Africa reported outbreaks of foot and mouth disease. But no ban was imposed on meat imports from the two countries until seven weeks later. Beef from Swaziland was on sale in a caterer's wholesalers 10 days ago. There is also concern that food is still being imported from other countries where foot and mouth disease is endemic.</p> <p>Shadow Agriculture Minister Tim Yeo said the delay in banning imports was shocking. 'We have to make absolutely sure that we don't import meat at all from any country with a recent outbreak,' he said.</p> <p>But even that may not be feasible. Unscrupulous dealers are exploiting a loophole in food importing regulations to bring in tonnes of high-risk meat every week. Port Health Authority sources say there are 200 seizures each month of meat products at airports. The bulk of these are of 'bush meat' from Africa - for which there is a large and growing demand in Britain.</p> <p>The meat, often from species of animals that infect local cattle herds with foot and mouth disease, can be hidden in fruit and vegetable consignments which, unlike meat imports, are rarely checked rigorously. 'It is just not feasible to see what is hidden down the end of a 40ft lorry full of melons. There's loads of stuff coming in,' said one PHA official.</p> <p>Professor Tim Lang, a food policy expert at Thames Valley University, said Britain's under-resourced food regulatory regime was tearing at the seams. 'We just can't currently cope with modern globalised trade. It is a mess.'</p> <p>The mobility of modern livestock is also a serious problem. In 1967, when foot and mouth last hit Britain, farms were smaller and animals were raised, slaughtered and eaten locally. Now the industrialised, globalised agricultural economy means livestock regularly travel thousands of miles to abattoirs or farms around the country or indeed the world. Senior EU officials are now demanding a 'tagging' system to monitor movements.</p> <p>But the sins of some farmers and the structural problems with the industry have been compounded by a catalogue of mismanagement by Maff which has infuriated Downing Street.</p> <p>Start with the idea of culling, which was always controversial. It was sold as the only way to swiftly contain the virus. By killing all livestock within two miles of an infected farm in the hotspots of Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway - and now possibly the rest of the country too - 'firebreaks' around the disease would be created. But the policy has been a failure.</p> <p>Experts recommend that an infected herd should be killed within 24 hours. In most of the country this has simply not happened. In the Devon village of Highampton, one of the worst-hit spots in the country, George Thomas had to wait four days before his cattle were killed. During that time the animals were highly infectious and still in the field. At the time Thomas's farm was the second in Devon to be infected. Now there are 53. It is happening across the country. Downing Street has now re-instated the 24-hour deadline, and demanded that Maff stick to it. But No 10 knows that it is weeks too late.</p> <p>The lack of vets and slaughtermen - as well as the resources to burn the bodies - is becoming obvious. Maff only had 220 vets when the crisis began. Now that number has risen to 700, boosted by people from other departments and more than 100 volunteers from overseas. About 120 final year veterinary students have also been recruited. Again it has taken weeks for the Government to get on top of the problem.</p> <p>The burning of a dead animal is an ugly sight. As the animal starts to heat up just after the fire is lit and the flames are still small, the air in its lungs expands, forcing out its last breath in a pathetic sigh. The air is full of the virus. As the meat turns black from the flames, the blisters on the cows' and pigs' mouths and feet warm and burst, propelling more virus on a vortex of hot air.</p> <p>The public has not been told, but scientists who advise Maff know the truth. Burning animals does not eradicate disease. Although the virus hates heat, many of the fires have been partial and, far from stopping the virus, have merely served to spread it.</p> <p>'It could theoretically be a mechanism of spread. We are investigating it,' admitted Professor Alex Donaldson, head of the laboratories at the Institute of Animal Health at Pirbright. Burying the animals would be preferable, he said, but the water companies and the Environment Agency have objected because of the possibility of contamination of underground supplies.</p> <p>Donaldson went further. The closure of all footpaths - even in woods and in areas away from livestock - has also been exposed as having no scientific justification. There has never been a single example anywhere of a casual walker not in contact with animals spreading the disease,' he said. This week the Forestry Commission and local authorities will bow to science and reopen many of the country's woods and parks to walkers.</p> <p>The clear inadequacy of the Government's measures in controlling the outbreak is rapidly forcing it to abandon one of its most cherished beliefs. Vaccination, which until now it had dismissed as unthinkable, is on the political agenda. Britain, alone in Europe, has never vaccinated against the disease. It was the pioneer of the mass-slaughter and eradicate policy, and persuaded the rest of Europe to abandon vaccination a decade ago. In Maff circles vaccination is considered akin to treason.</p> <p>So unthinkable was vaccination that Maff simply did not look at it, and failed to realise science has moved on since they last considered it decades ago. None of the contingency plans even mentioned vaccination as an option. Many of the briefings given to journalists were embarrassingly out of date.</p> <p>The Observer can reveal that so strong was the anti-vaccination fervour that veterinary scientists who thought that vaccination could be an option were told they could lose their jobs if they spoke out. All veterinary scientists with knowledge of foot and mouth either work directly for Maff, or for Government departments that are funded by Maff. No one dared to openly criticise the policy.</p> <p>It took the Soil Association, which sets organic standards in this country, to open the debate. 'It was becoming increasingly obvious that the control measures weren't working, so we decided we had to put our heads above the parapet,' said Patrick Holden, director of the Soil Association. The association agreed to commission a study from the Elm Farm Research Centre into the possible benefits of vaccination. Half a dozen veterinary scientists agreed to work on it, but all on an anonymous basis because of the close links between veterinary expertise and the Government. At least one was threatened with the sack if he helped this heretical operation.</p> <p>The paper set out a devastating critique of the mass slaughter policy. Quoting endless studies, and examples around the world of where vaccination had been used, it showed that it could rapidly reduce the spread of the disease. The epidemiology reports that had so shocked Blair on Thursday morning agreed that the present policy was not working. One, from Imperial College, said that vaccination would reduce the virulence of the disease.</p> <p>Last week the association held a debate to discuss its findings, but Maff refused to send anyone along to answer questions. Later in the evening, Brown, without any of his veterinary advisers, met the director of the Soil Association, and seemed open to the idea. The association had been helped in its campaign by the Netherlands government which had announced a vaccination programme as soon as it had its first case of foot and mouth. In that country there have been a total of four cases.</p> <p>This weekend Blair returned early to Chequers from the European summit at Stockholm, telling officials it was better that he was at the centre of things rather than bogged down in negotiations on market regulation.</p> <p>He has now given himself seven days to decide on the date of the general election. Until last week he was sure that he could go ahead with his preferred date of 3 May, but unguarded comments to the president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, revealed that Blair now realises that he may have to postpone. He told Prodi on Friday, overheard by a camera crew, that he had '10 days' to decide, suggesting that he would either call the election on 2 April or plump for a pre-summer election in June.</p> <p>Senior figures within the party are now counselling a 'short pause' on the general election plans to show the public that the Government is taking the disease seriously. One of the Prime Minister's closest allies said a few weeks' delay would allow Downing Street to keep control of the issue until all the practical obstacles to eradicating the disease had been overcome. Then it was a question of allowing foot and mouth to run its course.</p> <p>Labour is now drawing up a June contingency plan in case the disease still appears out of control by Friday. Although the war rooms are ready in Millbank and most officials say there are no practical difficulties to having an election, Blair is most worried about the perception the public may gain if pushes for an early election. He will make a final decision on Saturday.</p> <p>Blair knows time is running out. As he looks out over the grey stone walls and green hilly fields of Inglewood Edge Farm that have shaped his life since he was a boy, John Hall is starting to think the unthinkable. Foot and mouth may be the last blow to a life on the land that was becoming difficult to sustain. 'We have a big farm and we employ a few people. But it has just become impossible. This is, I think, the end.'</p> <p><b>The main players</b><br><br></p> <p><b> Jonathan Powel: </b>Number 10 chief of staff, ordered by Blair to head fightback against foot and mouth.<br><br> <b> Jim Scudamore: </b>Maff's chief veterinary officer, relied on by Government to develop cull policy.<br><br><b>David King: </b>Chief scientist, advising Blair directly on likely extent of outbreak.<br><br><b> Nick Brown: </b> Minister for Agriculture, in the firing line as extent of epidemic becomes clear.</p>",

But the policy has been a failure. Experts recommend that an infected herd should be killed within 24 hours. In most of the country this has simply not happened. In the Devon village of Highampton, one of the worst-hit spots in the country, George Thomas had to wait four days before his cattle were killed. During that time the animals were highly infectious and still in the field. At the time Thomas's farm was the second in Devon to be infected. Now there are 53. It is happening across the country. Downing Street has now re-instated the 24-hour deadline, and demanded that Maff stick to it. But No 10 knows that it is weeks too late. The lack of vets and slaughtermen - as well as the resources to burn the bodies - is becoming obvious. Maff only had 220 vets when the crisis began. Now that number has risen to 700, boosted by people from other departments and more than 100 volunteers from overseas. About 120 final year veterinary students have also been recruited. Again it has taken weeks for the Government to get on top of the problem. The burning of a dead animal is an ugly sight. As the animal starts to heat up just after the fire is lit and the flames are still small, the air in its lungs expands, forcing out its last breath in a pathetic sigh. The air is full of the virus. As the meat turns black from the flames, the blisters on the cows' and pigs' mouths and feet warm and burst, propelling more virus on a vortex of hot air. The public has not been told, but scientists who advise Maff know the truth. Burning animals does not eradicate disease. Although the virus hates heat, many of the fires have been partial and, far from stopping the virus, have merely served to spread it. 'It could theoretically be a mechanism of spread. We are investigating it,' admitted Professor Alex Donaldson, head of the laboratories at the Institute of Animal Health at Pirbright. Burying the animals would be preferable, he said, but the water companies and the Environment Agency have objected because of the possibility of contamination of underground supplies. Donaldson went further. The closure of all footpaths - even in woods and in areas away from livestock - has also been exposed as having no scientific justification. There has never been a single example anywhere of a casual walker not in contact with animals spreading the disease,' he said. This week the Forestry Commission and local authorities will bow to science and reopen many of the country's woods and parks to walkers. The clear inadequacy of the Government's measures in controlling the outbreak is rapidly forcing it to abandon one of its most cherished beliefs. Vaccination, which until now it had dismissed as unthinkable, is on the political agenda. Britain, alone in Europe, has never vaccinated against the disease. It was the pioneer of the mass-slaughter and eradicate policy, and persuaded the rest of Europe to abandon vaccination a decade ago. In Maff circles vaccination is considered akin to treason. So unthinkable was vaccination that Maff simply did not look at it, and failed to realise science has moved on since they last considered it decades ago. None of the contingency plans even mentioned vaccination as an option. Many of the briefings given to journalists were embarrassingly out of date. The Observer can reveal that so strong was the anti-vaccination fervour that veterinary scientists who thought that vaccination could be an option were told they could lose their jobs if they spoke out. All veterinary scientists with knowledge of foot and mouth either work directly for Maff, or for Government departments that are funded by Maff. No one dared to openly criticise the policy. It took the Soil Association, which sets organic standards in this country, to open the debate. 'It was becoming increasingly obvious that the control measures weren't working, so we decided we had to put our heads above the parapet,' said Patrick Holden, director of the Soil Association. The association agreed to commission a study from the Elm Farm Research Centre into the possible benefits of vaccination. Half a dozen veterinary scientists agreed to work on it, but all on an anonymous basis because of the close links between veterinary expertise and the Government. At least one was threatened with the sack if he helped this heretical operation. The paper set out a devastating critique of the mass slaughter policy. Quoting endless studies, and examples around the world of where vaccination had been used, it showed that it could rapidly reduce the spread of the disease. The epidemiology reports that had so shocked Blair on Thursday morning agreed that the present policy was not working. One, from Imperial College, said that vaccination would reduce the virulence of the disease. Last week the association held a debate to discuss its findings, but Maff refused to send anyone along to answer questions. Later in the evening, Brown, without any of his veterinary advisers, met the director of the Soil Association, and seemed open to the idea. The association had been helped in its campaign by the Netherlands government which had announced a vaccination programme as soon as it had its first case of foot and mouth. In that country there have been a total of four cases. This weekend Blair returned early to Chequers from the European summit at Stockholm, telling officials it was better that he was at the centre of things rather than bogged down in negotiations on market regulation. He has now given himself seven days to decide on the date of the general election. Until last week he was sure that he could go ahead with his preferred date of 3 May, but unguarded comments to the president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, revealed that Blair now realises that he may have to postpone. He told Prodi on Friday, overheard by a camera crew, that he had '10 days' to decide, suggesting that he would either call the election on 2 April or plump for a pre-summer election in June. Senior figures within the party are now counselling a 'short pause' on the general election plans to show the public that the Government is taking the disease seriously. One of the Prime Minister's closest allies said a few weeks' delay would allow Downing Street to keep control of the issue until all the practical obstacles to eradicating the disease had been overcome. Then it was a question of allowing foot and mouth to run its course. Labour is now drawing up a June contingency plan in case the disease still appears out of control by Friday. Although the war rooms are ready in Millbank and most officials say there are no practical difficulties to having an election, Blair is most worried about the perception the public may gain if pushes for an early election. He will make a final decision on Saturday. Blair knows time is running out. As he looks out over the grey stone walls and green hilly fields of Inglewood Edge Farm that have shaped his life since he was a boy, John Hall is starting to think the unthinkable. Foot and mouth may be the last blow to a life on the land that was becoming difficult to sustain. 'We have a big farm and we employ a few people. But it has just become impossible. This is, I think, the end.' The main players Jonathan Powel: Number 10 chief of staff, ordered by Blair to head fightback against foot and mouth. Jim Scudamore: Maff's chief veterinary officer, relied on by Government to develop cull policy. David King: Chief scientist, advising Blair directly on likely extent of outbreak. Nick Brown: Minister for Agriculture, in the firing line as extent of epidemic becomes clear.",

      "body": "<p>She went to Cheltenham Ladies College and recalls 'knicker checks' with undisguised bitterness. He was sent to Charterhouse and has not forgotten being held against study fires by school bullies. Both left university early, desperately impatient to embark on careers in journalism. </p> <p>He hurried into Fleet Street where, as a young reporter, he gained a reputation among young female colleagues as NSIT - deb-speak for Not Safe In Taxis. She went on to become part of the collective which founded Spare Rib, enjoying run-ins with alcohol and drugs on the way. </p> <p>Now Max Hastings edits London's Evening Standard. He is driven about town - and down to his beloved countryside - in a chauffeured Range-Rover. With his patrician manner, pinstripe suits and Gatling Gun bark, he rarely runs into Rosie Boycott, who networks through the arts, publishing, New Labour and fashion. But if he had not registered her fully until now, Boycott will soon enter Hastings's gun-sights. Having edited Esquire, the Independent and lately the Daily and Sunday Express - she walked out with a \u00a3350,000 pay-off after its takeover by porn magnate Richard Desmond - Boycott has been in discreet talks with City institutions. According to friends, she will soon announce plans to launch a new London daily newspaper to rival the Standard. </p> <p>Arts-inspired. Feature-led. Softer. Kinder. Less abrasive. Less snide. Those are the whispers that pals of Boycott say describe 'The Project'. She is amazed our capital city supports only one evening paper. A paper out of kilter, she thinks, with the liberal consensus that exists in one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. </p> <p>She faces a tough fight. With Hastings in the editor's chair since 1996, the Standard has maintained its circulation at around 450,000, higher than some national dailies. And it has seen off friendly fire from its stablemate Metro, a daily freesheet launched to stifle rival insurgents. </p> <p>Complaints from detractors that Hastings does not represent the 'real' London are easily rehearsed. He is devoted to country living, and has made the Standard the most vocal Fleet Street opponent of the abolition of hunting. His passion is shooting. </p> <p>His publication employs a tiny number of black staff - something he recently acknowledged to be a genuine embarrassment in a city where 15 per cent of the workforce is from ethnic minorities. It has been observed that his news pages rarely feature photographs of black people unless they have committed a criminal offence. The paper employs a similarly tiny number of gays. </p> <p>Hastings is best known for 'liberating' Port Stanley during the Falklands War. As a war correspondent, he entered the Upland Goose pub in Port Stanley - and asked for a snifter - some hours before British troops finally arrived. Boycott is now feted as 'Rizla Rosie', the committed radical who once launched a campaign backing the decriminalisation of cannabis. </p> <p>However, Hastings is not as predictable as caricatures often paint him. After moving to the Standard from the Daily Telegraph , he persuaded his new proprietor, Lord Rothermere, to let the paper back Labour in 1997, for the first time in its history. The move dismayed the Conservative Party. Insiders expect Hastings to offend his old party once again when this year's election is finally called. 'It hurts him deeply, but Max regards William Hague as a ghastly little twerp,' disclosed a senior Standard executive. 'Max is also Euro-sensible, rather than Eurosceptic.' </p> <p>'Max would blanch if you suggested it,' says one journalist from the tiny coterie who have worked for both Boycott and Hastings, 'but the remarkable thing is just how similar they are. Both he and Rosie are doggedly loyal to staff they rate. Both have barks far worse than their bite. Both are actually very good listeners. </p> <p>'And both are also keen to praise success. For all his military talk of not sharing trenches with unreliable sorts and avoiding the flak, Max can be sensitive. He'll send you a slightly awkward \"herogram\" memo, marked private and confidential. Rosie, of course, will come up and hug you in front of the entire newsroom.' </p> <p>Boycott may have to do lots and lots of hugging if she is to succeed in the tough London newspaper market, in spite of her friends' insistence that she will demand investors' backing for five years before promising success. The last serious project to take on the Evening Standard - the London Daily News, launched by Robert Maxwell in 1987 - floundered in months. 'If Rosie is going to succeed,' says Magnus Linklater, former editor of the Daily News, 'she needs to focus just as much on the distribution as the editorial. We also placed ourselves to the left of the Standard, but we still did not make much inroad. The paper has a pretty strong lockhold on its readership.' </p> <p>Yesterday, Boycott was not available to comment. But Hastings was gallantry itself: 'I wish Rosie the best of luck. No journalist should be anything other than delighted if another newspaper comes into the field. It's good for everyone. She's a very brave girl if she's able to make it work. However, we'll give her a good run for her money. ' </p> <p>'Max is one of the big beasts of Fleet Street,' acknowledges a Boycott admirer, 'but no one should underestimate Rosie either. She may be a woman who champions female ways of doing things but ironically she is tougher - much tougher - than many think.' </p> <p>When the guns start firing, probably some time early next year, Boycott's mettle will be tested. The greatest irony of all is that she is exactly the sort of spunky subaltern that Hastings would like to have somewhere in his trench. Except, of course, he's bitterly opposed to women on the frontline. </p> <p><strong> Rosie Boycott, 49 </strong></p> <p><strong>Recreations:</strong> Gardening, 'making cushions' </p> <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Jogging, Pilates </p> <p><strong>Obsessions:</strong> Reading, the arts </p> <p><strong> Pets:</strong> Bingo, a mongrel rescued from the Battersea Dogs Home </p> <p><strong> Clubs:</strong> Groucho </p> <p><strong> Home:</strong> Town house in Notting Hill </p> <p><strong> On London:</strong> 'One of the most vibrant, exciting, happening cities in the world.

According to friends, she will soon announce plans to launch a new London daily newspaper to rival the Standard. Arts-inspired. Feature-led. Softer. Kinder. Less abrasive. Less snide. Those are the whispers that pals of Boycott say describe 'The Project'. She is amazed our capital city supports only one evening paper. A paper out of kilter, she thinks, with the liberal consensus that exists in one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. She faces a tough fight. With Hastings in the editor's chair since 1996, the Standard has maintained its circulation at around 450,000, higher than some national dailies. And it has seen off friendly fire from its stablemate Metro, a daily freesheet launched to stifle rival insurgents. Complaints from detractors that Hastings does not represent the 'real' London are easily rehearsed. He is devoted to country living, and has made the Standard the most vocal Fleet Street opponent of the abolition of hunting. His passion is shooting. His publication employs a tiny number of black staff - something he recently acknowledged to be a genuine embarrassment in a city where 15 per cent of the workforce is from ethnic minorities. It has been observed that his news pages rarely feature photographs of black people unless they have committed a criminal offence. The paper employs a similarly tiny number of gays. Hastings is best known for 'liberating' Port Stanley during the Falklands War. As a war correspondent, he entered the Upland Goose pub in Port Stanley - and asked for a snifter - some hours before British troops finally arrived. Boycott is now feted as 'Rizla Rosie', the committed radical who once launched a campaign backing the decriminalisation of cannabis. However, Hastings is not as predictable as caricatures often paint him. After moving to the Standard from the Daily Telegraph , he persuaded his new proprietor, Lord Rothermere, to let the paper back Labour in 1997, for the first time in its history. The move dismayed the Conservative Party. Insiders expect Hastings to offend his old party once again when this year's election is finally called. 'It hurts him deeply, but Max regards William Hague as a ghastly little twerp,' disclosed a senior Standard executive. 'Max is also Euro-sensible, rather than Eurosceptic.' 'Max would blanch if you suggested it,' says one journalist from the tiny coterie who have worked for both Boycott and Hastings, 'but the remarkable thing is just how similar they are. Both he and Rosie are doggedly loyal to staff they rate. Both have barks far worse than their bite. Both are actually very good listeners. 'And both are also keen to praise success. For all his military talk of not sharing trenches with unreliable sorts and avoiding the flak, Max can be sensitive. He'll send you a slightly awkward \"herogram\" memo, marked private and confidential. Rosie, of course, will come up and hug you in front of the entire newsroom.' Boycott may have to do lots and lots of hugging if she is to succeed in the tough London newspaper market, in spite of her friends' insistence that she will demand investors' backing for five years before promising success. The last serious project to take on the Evening Standard - the London Daily News, launched by Robert Maxwell in 1987 - floundered in months. 'If Rosie is going to succeed,' says Magnus Linklater, former editor of the Daily News, 'she needs to focus just as much on the distribution as the editorial. We also placed ourselves to the left of the Standard, but we still did not make much inroad. The paper has a pretty strong lockhold on its readership.' Yesterday, Boycott was not available to comment. But Hastings was gallantry itself: 'I wish Rosie the best of luck. No journalist should be anything other than delighted if another newspaper comes into the field. It's good for everyone. She's a very brave girl if she's able to make it work. However, we'll give her a good run for her money. ' 'Max is one of the big beasts of Fleet Street,' acknowledges a Boycott admirer, 'but no one should underestimate Rosie either. She may be a woman who champions female ways of doing things but ironically she is tougher - much tougher - than many think.' When the guns start firing, probably some time early next year, Boycott's mettle will be tested. The greatest irony of all is that she is exactly the sort of spunky subaltern that Hastings would like to have somewhere in his trench. Except, of course, he's bitterly opposed to women on the frontline.

It was Carrie's job to trek round North London playgroups in pursuit of the perfect pushchair, although it was Justine who has since confessed that she became a pushchair bore, compulsively wheeling into dinner parties with conversation-stoppers such as: 'Nice and light, the Graco Mirage, great shopping basket and good value as well.

Now we ask: how long will newspapers keep the web going? Both questions, of course, can be put too melodramatically. The truth is usually somewhere in between. Even so, consider the climate of the times in, say, 1999, just before Trinity bought the Mirror Group. Then it was conventional media companies without (in the analysts' opinion) a convincing internet strategy whose share prices were suffering. Lord Hollick proclaimed the vital Express synergies of print and net. Rupert Murdoch cancelled his last sceptical announcement. Unless you meant web business, you were liable to be out of business in a trice. The great consultancies prophesied the end of newspapers as we know them within half a decade. And now? Two months ago, there was a trickle of doubt; today there is a flood. Trinity cuts its planned internet spending in half and looks to sell its most problematical ventures.

But the overall task is large - the MoD did a 100 per cent stock survey of its married quarters after the deal with Annington in the mid-Nineties and found that repair work would cost \u00a3112 million more than its original estimate of \u00a3450m. </p> <p>'Everything we do is driven by affordability,' says Annington chief executive James Hopkins.

In other cases, Annington pays the 5 per cent deposit for buyers as part of a financial package to attract its target audience. Like most developers, the firm has preferred lenders and conveyancers to handle the purchases. </p> <p>The low-cost Annington homes have produced a benefit for the taxpayer - the MoD is in a profit-sharing scheme with the developer, and so far has received \u00a318m from sales. </p> <p>Up to 42,000 other homes may become available, although the MoD informs Annington of its property releases only six months in advance. </p> <p>Ironically, since mid-1997 the MoD has built around 650 new married quarters houses, mainly in areas where defence bases have been established in the recent past. </p> <p>But the MoD does not deal only in basic properties for the foot soldiers.

So it's hardly surprising that some of the talking points over the years have been labour-saving devices, such as the vacuum cleaner, first shown in 1920 and the automatic dishwasher (1959). This year some half a million people are expected to attend the show, which runs at Earls Court, London until 8 April and boasts an 18-metre lighthouse as its centrepiece. </p> <p>Research conducted by Mintel/NOP for the show underpins the role of the home as an external indica tor of social status; accordingly, our decorating priorities lie with the room that is seen the most. Some 66 per cent of respondents said it was important for the living room to be redecorated regularly, with the kitchen coming second at 16 per cent. </p> <p>Ideally, home improvements should be driven by our desire or need for them rather than just financial gain. It can make financial sense to carry out certain repairs and renovations before you sell your home, but this often has to do with saleability rather than price. A critical thing to remember is whether the level of improvement planned is right for the house. </p> <p>'You can actually over-improve a house,' said Mark Hemingway at the Halifax. 'An end-of-terrace house will only ever be an end-of-terrace house. Putting in a Jacuzzi might actually make it less marketable.' </p> <p>The Halifax says most improvements will add some value to a property, but this may only be a percentage of the actual cost: central heating or a garage add immediate value equal or more than equal to the cost. But a fitted kitchen, additional bedrooms, period restoration, additional bathroom/WC may only add value at a percentage of the actual cost. </p> <p>Double glazing/replacement windows, a conservatory, house extension or loft conversion add value at a percentage of the cost as well as extra saleability, while garden landscaping adds saleability. </p> <p>When considering home improvements, remember the following: more value is added where properties are in need of repair; space-increasing improvements tend to add the most value; properties in high-priced areas can benefit more significantly in terms of value from well-planned increases in floor space; and the value added also relates to the quality and aptness of the improvement. </p> <p>According to the Halifax Home Improvements Sur vey, adding value is increasingly given as the main motivation, quoted by 40 per cent of respondents last year, against 28 per cent in 1996. Just over half used personal savings, an option preferred more by women (62 per cent) than men (46 per cent). The number of people taking out secured personal loans to fund improvements doubled between 1998 and last year. A secured personal loan was third on the list. </p> <p>According to Mark Hemingway at the Halifax, the lender grants about 350,000 further mortgage advances to fund home improvements each year. </p> <p>'This can cover everything from a new roof down to redecoration,' he says. </p> <p>With interest rates so low, many people may well dip into their savings to finance their home improvements. </p> <p>But if you shop around, and particularly if you check out internet accounts, it is possible to find homes for your savings that are paying a higher rate of interest than would be charged on a further mortgage advance.</p> <p><strong>Five points to remember... </strong></p> <p>\u0095 If you do use your savings, make sure you keep some cash for emergencies. </p> <p>\u0095 A personal loan may seem more flexible but the interest will normally be higher than that on a further mortgage advance.</p> <p>\u0095 Mortgages are more flexible these days; for example, a further mortgage advance could run for a shorter period than the main mortgage.</p> <p>\u0095 You may think of remortgaging at the same time, but always check the terms and conditions on your loan.</p> <p>\u0095 If your mortgage was taken out before 1995, you enjoy increased mortgage protection under Income Support should you need to claim.</p>",

But if you shop around, and particularly if you check out internet accounts, it is possible to find homes for your savings that are paying a higher rate of interest than would be charged on a further mortgage advance. Five points to remember... \u0095 If you do use your savings, make sure you keep some cash for emergencies. \u0095 A personal loan may seem more flexible but the interest will normally be higher than that on a further mortgage advance. \u0095 Mortgages are more flexible these days; for example, a further mortgage advance could run for a shorter period than the main mortgage. \u0095 You may think of remortgaging at the same time, but always check the terms and conditions on your loan. \u0095 If your mortgage was taken out before 1995, you enjoy increased mortgage protection under Income Support should you need to claim.",

      "bodyText": "Wary of the stock market and wondering what to do with the money you set aside for Isas? How about using it to cut your mortgage? Increasing your monthly payments by \u00a350 will save just over \u00a318,500 over the 25-year life of a \u00a370,000 loan and chop five years off the term, says Virgin One. Or a lump sum payment of \u00a35,000 in the second year of the loan would save you just under \u00a318,000 and cut the term by nearly four years. Reducing a loan is heartily recommended by mortgage advisers. 'If you put that money into a deposit account instead, it would have to be getting a pretty good rate to beat reducing the mortgage,' says David Hollingworth of London &amp; Country Mortgages. A higher-rate taxpayer who chose another investment instead would need a gross return of 11.6 per cent to beat the example given by Virgin. Someone on basic-rate tax would need 8.9 per cent gross. These figures would be predicted for 2001 by only the bravest spirits. It has to be said, however, that the Virgin figures assume a mortgage rate of 6.95 per cent - more than many of us are paying. Even if your mortgage rate was just 6 per cent, however, as a higher-rate taxpayer you would need to earn 10 per cent to get a better return than cutting the mortgage. A basic-rate taxpayer would have to earn 7.7 per cent. Good as the idea sounds, there are complications. If you are on a fixed-rate or discounted mortgage deal, there may be a penalty for paying off some or all the loan early. In these cases, it will rarely be worthwhile, says Hollingworth. Some lenders do, however, let people on these deals pay off something extra each year without incurring the penalty. At many lenders the figure is 10 per cent of the loan. If you decide to pay off part of your loan, be careful. Many lenders' bureaucratic systems have traditionally been very poor at accepting early repayments. Hollingworth says: 'Lenders would rather you didn't pay off early. The more you owe, the better it is for them because they are charging you interest.' So find out from your lender what its system is for partial repayments. Write a note to go with your cheque, explaining it is an early repayment. Keep a copy of the note and check afterwards that the sum has been processed as you wanted. It could be that your lender will need someone at head office to make a manual adjustment to your account - surprising, but true. Some lenders set a minimum amount which they will accept as a partial repayment, usually about \u00a3250 or \u00a3500. So if you are diverting a \u00a350-a-month Isa contribution to your mortgage, you may need to save up the right amount first. Consumer demand is encouraging lenders to make things easier, however. Among those playing a part are the Nationwide building society, which will take a little as \u00a31 as an early repayment, and Virgin One which offers a 'flexible' mortgage where customers can decide how much to repay each month. Virgin's 60,000 clients can take payment holidays or overpay. But 92 per cent of them choose to pay more than they need, 2 per cent are on target to pay off their loans in exactly 25 years and just 6 per cent are underpaying. Research from the Council of Mortgage Lenders concludes that 16 per cent of borrowers are on 'flexible' loans where they can over- and underpay. London &amp; Country's Hollingworth says most homeowners are risk-averse: 'They see the mortgage as a millstone and they want to get rid of it.' But payment holidays are useful to people whose circumstances change - if they have a child, for instance. At a time of stock market uncertainty, paying off some of your loan early can be a sensible. Reducing your liabilities when you have some spare cash can help you sleep better at night - especially if you are worried about losing your job. Yet if you are laid off, you may want to keep some spare cash to help pay your mortgage before state help kicks in. For homes bought or remortgaged after Octo ber 1995, you have to pay your own homeloan costs for the first nine months of unemployment before the state takes over. For other properties, the state pays half after two months and the full amount after another four For some people, it will be better not to have Isas and other savings worth more than \u00a38,000. This is the cut-off threshold for many means-tested benefits, including Working Families Tax Credit and the income-based Job Seekers' Allowance, the form of unemployment benefit paid after the first six months of non-means-tested help is over. Welfare workers warn, however, that deliberately offloading savings may disqualify you from pay-outs. Even when there are no clouds on the economic horizon, there is a strong argument for minimising what you owe. The smaller your debts, the more insulated you are from stock market volatility and other unpredictable events.",

His biographer, Henry McDonald, says: \"He grew up in a psychological atmosphere dominated by an ever-present state of siege and a sense of unbroken service to the British Crown.\" His education in primary and grammar schools was in Bangor, but he returned to Queen's University in Belfast where he was awarded a first class honours in law. He was in the air cadets there but, at 17, he had already joined the Orange order and begun his career as a political battler. Some 40 years later the battle is far from over. Two years after winning the Nobel Peace Prize his position as party leader was so weakened by rejectionists among Protestant unionists that in March 2000 he had to fight off a challenge for the leadership from the extreme Rev Martin Smyth MP. In May 2000 he survived by just 56 votes after a \"back me or sack me\" speech. In September 2000 his party lost its safest seat, South Antrim, to Billy McCrea, an extreme hymn-singing Paisleyite, and a month later, he only survived as Ulster Unionist leader by promising to ban Sinn Fein from crossborder talks unless they increased the pace of arms decommissioning. Through his political agility, Mr Trimble has often managed to make his opponents lean out to help him reach the centre. The British Government replaced Mo Mowlam as Northern Ireland secretary - first with Peter Mandelson and then John Reid - and eased up on the Patten reforms of the RUC. Even Sinn Fein has apparently pressed the IRA to speed up the beginning of its arms handover. Flinty David Trimble shows no outward sign of the flexibility needed for this act. Uptight, irascible and tetchy, he is known for his bad temper. He is far from the stereotypical gladhanding, backslapping Irish professional politician. In fact, his aversion to the \"touchy-feely\" approach of Mrs Mowlam led him to ask Tony Blair to replace her. What marks cerebral Mr Trimble out from his colleagues is that he is much brighter than those he dismisses as \"wooden tops\". He could see the advantages of being recognised as a \"bridgebuilder\" in such a divided society as Northern Ireland. But he dislikes being seen as the De Klerk of Northern Ireland: \"I would much rather be the Mandela. De Klerk was the leader of a minority group that was frustrating the rights of the majority.\" This openness to change has secured his place in history. Whether he stays to achieve a lasting peace in the province, or falls, with the honour of having tried, will determine if that place is in a footnote, or earns a chapter all of its own.

      "body": "<p>On Thursday, 1 March 2001, I ate a perfect meal. Flawless, immaculate, irreproachable. A meal astounding in its simplicity yet as exciting as anything I have ever put in my mouth. A meal devoid of the usual bells and whistles so beloved of restaurant chefs and Michelin inspectors. There was no hiding place on this plate, no frills, no ego: just a piece of white fish on a white plate on a white tablecloth. A paper tablecloth, at that. </p> <p>It takes a brave cook to ask a king's ransom for a piece of fish unadorned but for a spoonful of greens and a wedge of lemon. Even if that fish is a slice of turbot as thick as your thumb and as pure and white as the snow that falls whilst we sleep. For once, a piece of fish that had actually been cooked properly, none of this raw-in-the-middle stuff that's so popular right now. (If I wanted sushi, I'd have gone to a Japanese restaurant.) But this was the real thing - understated and cleanly presented. No sauce, no twiddly bits, no bull. Nothing to hide behind, you see - for once the chef is truly naked. It takes a genius to pull off such cooking. But they did, that rain-lashed, winter-spring lunchtime at the River Cafe in London. </p> <p>I have never been the sort of gushing foodie who asks a chef for 'the recipe'. Only a naive home cook could assume that a professional chef can communicate the accumulated nous of a decade behind the stove in a single sentence. Such enjoyable eating isn't about recipes. It is about cooking. No sieves, pestles and mortars, blenders, blow torches and piping bags here. No truffles, foie gras, cocks' combs and bee pollen either. I am willing to bet this cook's recipe involved little more than fish, olive oil, salt and pepper. </p> <p>But what fish! I have probably eaten more memorable fish dishes in the past 12 months than I have eaten at any time in my life. There was the immaculate grilled lemon sole at St John in London's Clerkenwell last June, served with runner beans that tasted like they used to and followed by a tender and homely gooseberry tart; the black cod at Ubon in Canary Wharf with its fat, silken flakes and sweet coating of miso and mirin; the Dover sole at Sheekey's in Theatreland and its accompanying silver sauce-boat of Hollandaise sauce and creamed spinach. Less expensively, and less than a week ago, the lump of pearl-white halibut at Fish!, the bustling restaurant that now has branches in Birmingham and Guildford as well as London. Pity about the chips. </p> <p>OK, so I hate mucked-about food and will invariably choose the simplest thing on the menu whether I am in Bristol or Bombay, but that can also be the biggest risk - good eating is more about the quality of the ingredients and the surefootedness of the cook than it is about recipes and frills. The upside for us home cooks is that we have only to grasp a technique and to work at it, quietly, thoughtfully, until we get it right. The downside is that we may not get it quite right for a while. </p> <p>There can be nothing wrong, surely, with doing something over and over again until you get it as you like it. In fact, I see every reason to work at a recipe or an idea till it is spot on and gives you certain pleasure as you eat. It may, or may not, be the classic way to do something, it is just that it as good as it can be. A perfect thing. And so it is with fish. </p> <p>I say a whispered 'thank you' every time I pass my local fishmonger and he is still there, busily trading. I dread the day he retires. I shall be the first there to adorn his empty windows with graffiti and good wishes - Cod rest his sole; gone to a better plaice; may he Rest In Peas - but I'd miss him terribly. Fish long ago replaced meat as my protein of choice. Local fishmongers are few and far between; we must support them. I go there - a 30-minute walk - twice a week, but rarely with a shopping list. I make a spot decision based on sight, smell and my fishmonger's suggestion. </p> <p>Right now I am into simple baked fish. It is not an exaggeration to say that we should pay more attention to baking a piece of fish than to a souffl\u00e9. More than meat or even vegetables, you can all too easily miss the moment. I don't go along with the trend for fish that is incinerated without and raw within. I don't even see the point. But it is the judging of whether a piece of haddock, hake, brill, cod or - for those who can find it and afford it - turbot that is at its point of perfection which remains the crux of fish cookery. </p> <p>It is easy enough, though. Fish is ready to eat when the meat has shrunk slightly from its bones; you can peel its skin off without difficulty and the flesh will come easily away from the bone. The flakes must be easy to separate and will have made the brief passage from translucent to opaque. We are talking minutes here. Even for fish that is cooked right through, you should start checking after 10 minutes, but please, let's squash this silly trend for the raw-in-the-middle. It is an affectation, but more to the point - not what they try to have us believe - it just ain't cooked.</p> <p><strong> Baked halibut, lemon and parsley</strong><br> </p> <p> The point here is the fish, so choose it wisely and be generous with the pre-oven seasoning. Fresh and perky parsley is essential. You will want something else on your plate, though I suggest not much. Some lightly cooked spinach, tossed in a little butter after draining or maybe some chard leaves given similar treatment. Or, if you can get it, some stems of sea kale. Serves 2. </p> <p><strong> 2 slices of halibut or monkfish, about 250g each </strong></p> <p><strong>olive oil and a big knob of butter </strong></p> <p><strong>juice of 1 lemon </strong></p> <p><strong>a good handful of roughly chopped, spanking-fresh flat-leaf parsley </strong></p> <p>Get the oven really hot, setting it to at least 220 C/ gas mark 7. Put a shallow, oven-proof frying pan (ie one with a metal handle) over a high heat and add enough olive oil and butter to cover the bottom. Rub the fish thoroughly with salt and black pepper and lower each piece carefully into the hot oil. Leave the fish be for a minute or two, then gently slide a palette knife or fish slice underneath and quickly, firmly turn it over. Dither and you will break it. Leave for a further minute or two till there is a thin golden layer on the underside, then put the whole thing in the hot oven. </p> <p>Bake the fish until it is just set and a brilliant chalky white inside, and test by teasing out a large flake. It should come fairly easily away from the bone. The fish should be ready in about 10 minutes depending on the thickness and variety. Lift the fish on to warm plates, leaving the meagre juices in the pan. Taking care of the hot handle, put the pan over a moderate heat, squeeze in the lemon and toss in the parsley. Bring to a fierce bubble and tip over the plated fish. </p> <p><strong> Baked bream or brill with oregano and bay leaves</strong><br> </p> <p> Any whole, white fish would be fine here. Take a look at your fishmonger's slab: there may be lemon sole, plaice, sea bass or red mullet. The point is that the fish is cooked for a short time at a high temperature. For more than one fish you will need a large roasting tin or baking tray. Serves 2, unless the fish is small. </p> <p><strong>a medium-sized bream or brill or any of the fish above </strong></p> <p><strong>olive oil </strong></p> <p><strong>6 bay leaves </strong></p> <p><strong>4 large sprigs of dried oregano or several fat pinches of the ready crumbled sort </strong></p> <p><strong>1 lemon </strong></p> <p>Set the oven at 240 C/gas mark 8. Rinse and dry the fish - I pat it with kitchen roll - then lay it flat in baking dish. Shake a little olive oil over the fish, then scatter with the herbs, squeeze over the lemon juice and season with a grinding of sea salt and black pepper. </p> <p>The fish is ready when the skin peels away easily and the flesh is opaque. Test to see if the flesh will part easily form the bone. If it doesn't, then bake it for another few minutes. The time it takes will, of course, depend on the type and weight of your fish, but you should start testing after 10 minutes. </p> <p>Lift the fish from the dish on to a warm serving plate and spoon any juices over the fish. Serve with the sauce below.</p> <p><strong> A punchy sauce for a baked fish</strong><br> </p> <p> Green sauces with lively flavours are best suited to fish that have been robustly roasted with lemon, garlic and the tougher herbs. </p> <p><strong> 1 large bunch of flat-leaf parsley </strong><br> <strong> 6 bushy sprigs of basil </strong><br> <strong> 6 anchovy fillets, salted or packed in oil </strong><br> <strong> 1 tbsp Dijon mustard </strong><br> <strong> 1 tbsp capers </strong><br> <strong> extra-virgin olive oil </strong><br> <strong> lemon juice </strong></p> <p>Tear the parsley and basil leaves from their stems and stuff them into a food processor. Rinse the salt or oil from the anchovies and toss them in with the herbs, the mustard and the capers and blitz till all is a thick mush. </p> <p>Start pouring in the oil in a long, steady drizzle, and watch the mixture start to thicken (we are only talking seconds here). The sauce should be a thick slush.

      "body": "<p><strong>Telephone: </strong>020 7738 6576 <br><strong>Address: </strong>Neon, 71 Atlantic Road, London SW9 <br>Dinner for two, including wine and service, \u00a355.</p> <p>Sometimes, hard as it may be to believe, I get things wrong. I was wrong a few weeks back when I pompously announced that the escabeche of partridge served at Cigala, delicious though it was, did not deserve the name because it had been cooked first rather than marinated raw in citrus juice. I was confusing escabeche with ceviche, as only 420 of you wrote in to tell me. </p> <p>I was also wrong on this page a little over a year ago in a review of a funky place called Neon on Brixton's famed Atlantic Road in south London. After saying a few favourable things about the very short Italian menu, I turned soothsayer and proclaimed that I wouldn't be surprised if, a few months down the line, they dumped the food operation. Young, groovy twentysomethings come to this part of London to booze in the increasing number of hip bars and, the margin on alcohol being so dependable and the menu being so short, it seemed a logical if depressing thing for Neon to do. </p> <p>Cue sound of klaxon blowing big raspberry: I was wrong, wrong, wrong. Tiresias I ain't. Word reached me a few months ago that Marco Rebora, the owner-manager of Neon, was fed up with watching people sloshing spirits down their necks. It was food that really pushed his boat out. Therefore, he had decided to increase the number of dishes on the menu by a factor of five. And so, aware that I would be infuriating all those restaurants which haven't even been reviewed once, I decided to review Neon for a second time. </p> <p>I was entirely justified in doing so. Because there is now something very special indeed going on down here: some seriously impressive, gloriously authentic Italian food is emerging from a kitchen staffed by a mighty brigade of, er, two. Plus a dishwasher. How they do it I don't know, because the dishes arrive swiftly enough. I am merely grateful that they do, because Neon happens to be only a seven-minute walk away from my house. </p> <p>I went with Robert, a restaurateur whose family owns a small plot of Tuscany and who therefore knows one end of an Italian menu from the other. He admitted that the place would not usually be to his taste and it might not be to yours. Decor-wise, there are low communal tables, with benches with no back support. The decoration is minimalist, and music, which I believe the young people call happening sounds, drifts across the room. Even if it's not your thing, it is worth putting up with for the food. </p> <p>The menu roughly divides up into two halves: oven-baked breads and pizzas on one side, pastas and other dishes on the other. We began by ordering the focaccia abruzzese with cumin, fennel and olive oil from the list of breads, which can easily serve as starters. It should, Robert said, be flat and crisp and straight from the oven. It was, the heat of the bread helping the aromatics to waft deliciously in the mouth. </p> <p>For my starter, I went for orecchiette pasta (\u00a34.80), which look like big models of blood platelets or small models of Dutch caps, depending upon which image you find more appetising. It came with turnip greens, garlic and anchovy and was terrific, the soft, slightly bitter edge of the greens spiked up by the garlic and salty fish. Robert choose arancini (\u00a35.40), a classic Italian dish of fried risotto balls with mozzarella and white wine which, he said, was a good test of an Italian kitchen. They were, he announced, perfect: soft and light, with a crisp skin. They could have done with a little slick of tomato sauce for dipping or some dressing on the salad. But, he accepted, this was a small quibble. </p> <p>Robert's main course was a stew of salt cod with roast peppers (\u00a311.50). 'Perfectly authentic,' he said. 'The cod is just the right side of salty.' I chose porchetta - spiced belly pork severely roasted and served in thin slices. It was sublime, the crackling crunching softly, the meat taken to that point where it falls apart in the mouth. Robert tried some. 'Gosh,' he said. 'I'd cross town for that dish.' I grinned. 'And I only have to walk down Railton Road for it,' I said. He looked out at the street, which, 20 years ago, was the heart of the Brixton riots and which is still a little funky in places. 'It might be safer to cross town,' he said dryly. Shame on him. Brixton is changing, and Neon is the proof. We finished with a tiramisu and a chocolate and almond cake. Robert approved of both. They were a taste of his summers at Tuscan trattorias. </p> <p>I have tried the pizzas on previous visits and they too are marvellous, particularly the pomodori al forno, which is made with lots of roasted tomatoes, slices of Parma ham and no cheese, all on the same crisp focaccia base. It turns out that the menu, which Marco insists will be completely seasonal, has just moved into its spring mode and so is almost completely different from that described here, but this pizza will remain and the great porchetta will occasionally appear as a special. </p> <p>If there's a criticism, it is that the wine list is pitifully short. Doubtless he feels the punters in Brixton tend to prefer their beer, and he may be right, but a significant number will, I think, be willing to be rather more adventurous. God knows, the food deserves it. In short, it was worth my coming a second time. I'm now looking to my third, fourth and fifth visits.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a>.</p>",

I was wrong a few weeks back when I pompously announced that the escabeche of partridge served at Cigala, delicious though it was, did not deserve the name because it had been cooked first rather than marinated raw in citrus juice. I was confusing escabeche with ceviche, as only 420 of you wrote in to tell me. I was also wrong on this page a little over a year ago in a review of a funky place called Neon on Brixton's famed Atlantic Road in south London. After saying a few favourable things about the very short Italian menu, I turned soothsayer and proclaimed that I wouldn't be surprised if, a few months down the line, they dumped the food operation. Young, groovy twentysomethings come to this part of London to booze in the increasing number of hip bars and, the margin on alcohol being so dependable and the menu being so short, it seemed a logical if depressing thing for Neon to do. Cue sound of klaxon blowing big raspberry: I was wrong, wrong, wrong. Tiresias I ain't. Word reached me a few months ago that Marco Rebora, the owner-manager of Neon, was fed up with watching people sloshing spirits down their necks. It was food that really pushed his boat out. Therefore, he had decided to increase the number of dishes on the menu by a factor of five. And so, aware that I would be infuriating all those restaurants which haven't even been reviewed once, I decided to review Neon for a second time. I was entirely justified in doing so. Because there is now something very special indeed going on down here: some seriously impressive, gloriously authentic Italian food is emerging from a kitchen staffed by a mighty brigade of, er, two. Plus a dishwasher. How they do it I don't know, because the dishes arrive swiftly enough. I am merely grateful that they do, because Neon happens to be only a seven-minute walk away from my house. I went with Robert, a restaurateur whose family owns a small plot of Tuscany and who therefore knows one end of an Italian menu from the other. He admitted that the place would not usually be to his taste and it might not be to yours. Decor-wise, there are low communal tables, with benches with no back support. The decoration is minimalist, and music, which I believe the young people call happening sounds, drifts across the room. Even if it's not your thing, it is worth putting up with for the food. The menu roughly divides up into two halves: oven-baked breads and pizzas on one side, pastas and other dishes on the other. We began by ordering the focaccia abruzzese with cumin, fennel and olive oil from the list of breads, which can easily serve as starters. It should, Robert said, be flat and crisp and straight from the oven. It was, the heat of the bread helping the aromatics to waft deliciously in the mouth. For my starter, I went for orecchiette pasta (\u00a34.80), which look like big models of blood platelets or small models of Dutch caps, depending upon which image you find more appetising. It came with turnip greens, garlic and anchovy and was terrific, the soft, slightly bitter edge of the greens spiked up by the garlic and salty fish. Robert choose arancini (\u00a35.40), a classic Italian dish of fried risotto balls with mozzarella and white wine which, he said, was a good test of an Italian kitchen. They were, he announced, perfect: soft and light, with a crisp skin. They could have done with a little slick of tomato sauce for dipping or some dressing on the salad. But, he accepted, this was a small quibble. Robert's main course was a stew of salt cod with roast peppers (\u00a311.50). 'Perfectly authentic,' he said. 'The cod is just the right side of salty.' I chose porchetta - spiced belly pork severely roasted and served in thin slices. It was sublime, the crackling crunching softly, the meat taken to that point where it falls apart in the mouth. Robert tried some. 'Gosh,' he said. 'I'd cross town for that dish.' I grinned. 'And I only have to walk down Railton Road for it,' I said. He looked out at the street, which, 20 years ago, was the heart of the Brixton riots and which is still a little funky in places. 'It might be safer to cross town,' he said dryly. Shame on him. Brixton is changing, and Neon is the proof. We finished with a tiramisu and a chocolate and almond cake. Robert approved of both. They were a taste of his summers at Tuscan trattorias. I have tried the pizzas on previous visits and they too are marvellous, particularly the pomodori al forno, which is made with lots of roasted tomatoes, slices of Parma ham and no cheese, all on the same crisp focaccia base. It turns out that the menu, which Marco insists will be completely seasonal, has just moved into its spring mode and so is almost completely different from that described here, but this pizza will remain and the great porchetta will occasionally appear as a special. If there's a criticism, it is that the wine list is pitifully short. Doubtless he feels the punters in Brixton tend to prefer their beer, and he may be right, but a significant number will, I think, be willing to be rather more adventurous. God knows, the food deserves it. In short, it was worth my coming a second time. I'm now looking to my third, fourth and fifth visits. jay.rayner@observer.co.uk.",

      "body": "<p> How many slugs do you think a clematis is worth? Swap 50 big brown ones for a Clematis viticella or 48 snails and a gross of keeled slugs for a 'Gipsy Queen' and 'Marie Boisselot'? I ask no more than a square deal to set the balance straight. You may remember me writing about global warming at the start of this year and pointing out that for gardeners the worst side effect was the prevalence of warm, wet winters and the ensuing explosion of slugs and snails and all things fungal. What we needed, I wrote, was a good hard bit of winter weather. Note the 'good'. Ice and scouring winds would be bracing and lethal to all the diseases and fungi, and remorselessly lethal to slugs and snails. </p> <p>Well, here, at least, we have had and are having quite a lot of cold weather. We have had perhaps a dozen nights below -5 C and one when it dropped down to -14 C. Inevitably there is a gardening price to pay for this. We have lost a couple of bay trees, some artichokes, an agapanthus , four melianthus , all our broccoli, cabbages and cavolo nero (but not the kale or Brussels sprouts) and no doubt more casualties will be revealed as the growing season unfolds. </p> <p>Certainly the C cirrhosa 'Freckles' is a goner. Raymond Evison, the largest clematis grower in the UK, if not the world, says it is hardy to -12 C. I planted it in the southern lee of a hawthorn with loads of compost, bonemeal and good technique. It repaid this in the first year or so by merely not dying. It then grudgingly grew a foot or so, before succumbing to the first spring frost (as ever, it is the frosts of March and April that do the damage). But it did finally take off and grew up to the top of the hawthorn, covered in delicate, bronzed leaves - although it never produced a single flower. But last year it was covered in yellow flower bells, although I had to squint up into the sky to see most of them, tangled up in among the black spikes and incipient buds of the tree. And now it is as dead as last year's unpruned viticella , and all the squinting in the world will not conjure any flowers in the sky. </p> <p> Clematis armandii would have no chance here, but it is the hardiest of all the evergreen clematis (of which there are 17) and it grew luxuriantly in our London garden where it never got much below -5 C. It is, of course, evergreen, which makes it more susceptible to hard frost, with leathery leaves like burnished green origami spearheads and a frothing mass of wonderfully fragrant white flowers with widely spaced, tiny petals. Some writers describe the scent as being like hawthorn, which has a distinct note of ordure about it. </p> <p>My own experience of C armandii is much sweeter than that. It is a must for any garden with a sheltered south or west wall. Ours faced straight west and was intertwined with the rose 'New Dawn', growing to smother an 8ft wall, despite cutting back each year. In fact C armandii wants to grow to at least 15ft and there is not much short of brutality that will stop it. The two went well together. But to make the most of its scent, C armandii should really be planted somewhere near either a window or by a path where you pass - because it will have pretty much finished flowering by the time you start sitting out in the garden. There are a few hybrids, namely C armandii 'Apple Blossom', which has a pinkish cast to the flowers and a strong vanilla scent, or C armandii 'Jefferies', with longer, more pointed leaflets and wider-spaced petals on the flowers, which also recur (erratically) in the summer. </p> <p>I was reading in A Comprehensive Guide to Clematis by Barry Fretwell (\u00a312.99, Harper Collins) that the author grew C armandii in the Peak District at 1,000ft and over a number of years it was only cut back by frost once and regrew immediately with renewed vigour. The moral of that is that if you have one that is too big, sprawly and neglected, you can cut it back to the ground with impunity and it will grow back. </p> <p>An altogether tougher, safer bet for early clematis is C alpina, which will be in flower now in a sheltered urban garden, but comes into flower in this garden around 3 April, just when the pear blossom is beginning to break. C alpina is of European origin, growing in the Alps and other central European mountains and is apparently hardy to -30 C. The species will grow completely happily against a north-facing wall, although our hybrid 'Pamela Jackman' is growing up the same tree that the C cirrhosa has died all over. </p> <p>They were both planted at about the same time and the alpina is merely a quarter of the size but has grown steadily and healthily and produced the most wonderful blue flowers each spring. These flowers are made up of single petals that hang down like psychedelic goat's ears, growing directly from the leaf axils of the previous year's growth (which is why they should not be pruned, except for tidiness and then only immediately after flowering). </p> <p>The leaves of the alpina are the freshest green imaginable, a green you only find in April and May, lit by that clear, almost cold light of a British spring. The flowers are lovely, but the leaves definitely make them lovelier still. The Chinese version, C alpina macropetala , has semi-double sepals that are also more open. The best-known alpina is probably 'Francis Rivis', which is actually alpina var. ochotensis, and is also, confusingly, sometimes known as 'Blue Giant'. By any name it is a beautiful pale blue, with tepals that are broader than the species. C ochotensis is from Korea, Siberia and Japan, and is very similar to the alpina, with the main difference being that the flowers are larger - which largely accounts for the popularity of 'Francis Rivis'. </p> <p>Blue is always at a premium in the garden at any season and goes particularly well with the primrose yellows of spring, so I have no real desire to vary from alpina 's natural inclination to be blue; but you can get varieties in plum red, such as 'Ruby', a pink such as 'Constance' or 'Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9', or white as in 'Albiflora' or 'Burford White'. Whatever the colour of the flower, the seedheads all resolve as a wispy call that lasts prettily right through winter, as dry as the seemingly dead brown stems that will miraculously break into hundreds of pointed buds by the beginning of March.</p> <p><strong>My roots: a week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>I have just had one day at home since I wrote my last piece for these pages, so I had to cram my gardening into that space, painfully aware that time was flowing away. Not that this stopped me fiddling about and wasting at least a third of it. But I did get my onion sets in the ground. These are two sorts, 'Brunswick', which we grow every year for their colour and convenience of size, and a new variety from Unwins, called 'Setton'. I fear that the name is made up from onion and set, which is distressing, but they are organically grown and to be encouraged. </p> <p>Organic seed is easier to get hold of every year, but there are still quite big compromises to be made if you refuse to use non-organic seeds or bulbs. My feeling is that this is not something to flagellate oneself with, but take the organic option as it presents itself and keep as much of your own seed as possible. The main problem with onion sets comes in the first week or two before they have secured themselves into the soil, because the birds love to pull them up. I cover mine with fleece until they all have green shoots showing and are firmly anchored. </p> <p>Sarah and I went through all the pots of overwintering plants, taking stock of what had survived, what needed planting out soon and what should be chucked. Despite it all looking bedraggled, most had come through OK. Two big trays of Digitalis ferruginea had been festering since last summer, looking as dead as dodos, but when I pulled away the rotten leaves almost all had a healthy core of new growth. </p> <p>These were intended for the new damp bit (no name as yet: Bog Garden? No, not wet enough. Damp Garden? For sure, but that applies to every square inch of the place) but I did not get them planted before the dampness became a flood. There are also two large trays of Digitalis purpurea f albiflora which, again, would have been better planted out last autumn if it had not been for the wet. I must get these into the lime walk to flower in June and be followed by Nicotiana sylvestris. </p> <p>Last year I had real problems with the latter and could not get more than about a fifth of the plants I raised from seed to grow to any decent size. I think they were sown a little late and did not mature early enough. So I sowed a packet of seed to be ahead of the game. They are a fiddle to sow, thin, prick out, pot on and plant out, but if they perform as they can then worth it all.</p> <p><strong> Your roots Planting and caring for clematis</strong></p> <p> \u0095 Soak the plant in its pot for 10 minutes in a bucket of water while preparing the planting hole. </p> <p> \u0095 Clematis like to have their roots in the shade in rich, well-watered soil. Prepare a hole at least twice the size of the container that the plant came in and add a bucket of compost and a handful of bonemeal if you have any. </p> <p> \u0095 If you are planting your clematis to cover a wall, fence or tree, make sure the hole is at least a foot away from the base and angle the supporting cane back towards the wall. </p> <p> \u0095 Like roses, clematis need to be planted deep. Take the plant carefully out of the pot and place it so that the soil level of the container is at least an inch below the soil level of your hole. Fill back the topsoil to the junction of plant and potted compost and give it a good bucket of water. When this has drained, top up with a thick mulch of more compost. </p> <p> \u0095 If the base of the clematis is in the sun, put large pebbles around the roots to keep them cool and moist. Give it a full bucket of water once a week for the first few weeks and repeat if the weather is dry. If you are planting a clematis to climb a tree, water it more frequently. </p> <p> \u0095 Once you have planted it, prune it down to a strong bud about a foot off the ground. This might seem drastic but it will ensure a strong, healthy framework to establish the plant and many more flowers in subsequent years.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Equal pay 'tsars' will shame sexist employers into giving women a fair wage under a government action plan to root out workplace discrimination. </p> <p>Ministers will stage an annual summit to review the progress made for working women, at which poor performers will be expected to explain why they pay their female workers less than males. </p> <p>Meanwhile, leading figures from the arts, trade unions and business will be appointed as fair pay 'champions' within their industries. </p> <p>However, Employment Minister Tessa Jowell, who is to unveil the package on Tuesday, is likely to come under fire from equal opportunities' watchdogs for rejecting their demands for mandatory 'pay audits' or for a change in the law. </p> <p>The Equal Opportunities Commission wants employers to be forced to review the salaries of all staff and publish findings, exposing any discrimination. </p> <p>But Ministers have rejected the idea, which risks antagonising the business lobby, arguing that the pay gap is not only caused by sexism but also by women choosing or being steered into low-paid and low-skilled jobs. Jowell will say these are practical problems requiring 'practical solutions', not more legislation. </p> <p>'An 18 per cent pay gap is totally unacceptable. Even an 0.8 per cent pay gap is totally unacceptable. Any pay gap driven by discrimination is totally unacceptable,' she will say.

      "bodyText": "Equal pay 'tsars' will shame sexist employers into giving women a fair wage under a government action plan to root out workplace discrimination. Ministers will stage an annual summit to review the progress made for working women, at which poor performers will be expected to explain why they pay their female workers less than males. Meanwhile, leading figures from the arts, trade unions and business will be appointed as fair pay 'champions' within their industries. However, Employment Minister Tessa Jowell, who is to unveil the package on Tuesday, is likely to come under fire from equal opportunities' watchdogs for rejecting their demands for mandatory 'pay audits' or for a change in the law. The Equal Opportunities Commission wants employers to be forced to review the salaries of all staff and publish findings, exposing any discrimination. But Ministers have rejected the idea, which risks antagonising the business lobby, arguing that the pay gap is not only caused by sexism but also by women choosing or being steered into low-paid and low-skilled jobs. Jowell will say these are practical problems requiring 'practical solutions', not more legislation. 'An 18 per cent pay gap is totally unacceptable. Even an 0.8 per cent pay gap is totally unacceptable. Any pay gap driven by discrimination is totally unacceptable,' she will say. 'The Government will be working in partnership with business and the trade unions to make sure that the next ten years will be a decade for women in work, a decade in which the employment opportunities for all women will improve and in which the unfair, unacceptable and unlawful pay gap will be closed.' Women currently earn only 82 per cent of men's rates for equivalent work. Although the gap has closed since 1979, when women on average earned 63p for every pound taken home by a man in the same job, experts argue that 30 years of anti-sex discrimination laws have failed to close it and that more drastic action is needed. Recent research by the Women's Unit in Whitehall exploded the myth that women earn less simply because they have family responsibilities, showing that even childless females can expect to earn more than \u00a3100,000 less than men in the same jobs over their lifetimes. Jowell's plan will focus on part-time workers, for whom the gap in hourly pay is even wider, and women returning to work after having children. New mothers on average see their hourly pay fall by up to 16 per cent when they go back, partly because employers may assume they are no longer as committed to careers and partly because many go back to slightly different jobs. The network of 'pay champions' will spearhead a public campaign making it unacceptable to give women workers a poorer deal. Jowell will organise a yearly summit, the first of which is expected later this year, for business and the unions at which progress will be reviewed and poor performers identified. 'They will then have questions to answer,' said a source at the Department for Education. Jowell will also confirm plans to streamline employment tribunals, making it easier for women to sue for sexual discrimination. There is likely to be an advertising campaign to ensure that women are aware of their rights. Polls show four in 10 women are not aware they are entitled to time off in a domestic emergency, for example. The EOC will get a \u00a3100,000 grant to encourage voluntary pay audits at work. The watchdog has argued that, as long as employers are not compelled to carry them out, only the best bosses, probably already paying fairer rates, will want to carry out audits",

It's taken four years, but at least the Government is offering a signal that sexual equality matters. The big question is whether enough men are prepared to listen - and change.",

This will get everyone here killed.'</p> <p>We ask him about Albanian claims that Macedonian police and civic leaders have already handed weapons to Macedonian citizens.</p> <p>'All I know,' he says, 'is that Macedonians have been saying that now the time for the final battle with the Albanians has come.'</p> <p>This is how civil wars begin; how hatreds congeal - with the myth of the extremist gunman answering the call to 'defend' his people.</p> <p>Already the Albanians of Macedonia have their National Liberation Army, which is fighting for 'equal rights' for Albanians, who make up a third of the population. Never mind that the discrimination they suffer is hardly the stuff of revolutions. And now Macedonian extremists are organising to fight for their own people.</p> <p>Last week the headlines across the world described Macedonia as being on the brink of war. In many people's minds the war has already started. The time for talk and international mediation is almost over.</p> <p>Each day the shells fly out of the Macedonian army positions in and around Tetovo and crash into the mountain-top positions of the NLA. And each shell hardens support for the gunmen and a rejection of the Albanian Democratic Party, which joined power with the Macedonian majority in 1998.</p> <p>Each night the gunmen of the NLA creep down Baltepe mountain towards the town and take a few shots at the Macedonian positions. With each shot the minority of Macedonians in the town become more angry.</p> <p>And what the violence - though sporadic - is creating is a war of sectarian imagination that is rapidly becoming a 'real war' as Albanians and Macedonians withdraw from the imperfect form of their shared state into positions of mutual hate. It is an imagination that is irreducible to logic or argument.</p> <p>The killing last week of Ramiz, aged 57, and his son Ramadan Koraci, aged 38, in Tetovo by Macedonian police is a case in point. It does not matter to ordinary Albanians that many foreign journalists - this one included - have seen the tapes of Thursday's fatal shooting taken from three different angles, filmed by three different cameramen. Or that it shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that a panicking Ramadan pulled out a grenade as he was hauled from his car, and threw it at police at the moment he was shot. They cannot afford to believe it. Or that we saw the unexploded grenades lying on the ground.</p> <p>At the funeral on Friday on the outskirts of Tetovo, mourners insisted they were murdered in cold blood. The grenades were planted, they say. The photographs faked. What you see in the television footage was a mobile phone in Ramadan's hand.</p> <p>I met his uncle, Mahi Loku, at the funeral. He said: 'This shows these people [the Macedonians] will do anything to insinuate a situation. Ramadan took out his mobile phone, so they killed him. And then, when they dare to commit these acts, the Macedonians complain about what is happening here.'</p> <p>War closes minds. But civil wars also create a lethal new social cohesion even as they exclude 'the other'. And already the communities are lining up behind the gunmen on both sides.</p> <p>On a street corner in front of a row of little kiosks on the outskirts of Tetovo, Macedonia's second city, last Tuesday the Macedonian machine-gunners had sandbagged themselves into a little nest.</p> <p>A group of men and boys squeezed in beside them, sitting on their haunches. They handed the soldiers cold drinks, ran errands and dampened towels for the soldiers to wrap around the steaming barrels of their guns.</p> <p>It is here that the statesmen and spokesmen of the European Union and Nato and the international community - popping into Skopje and Tetovo on their shuttle missions - are missing the point as they dismiss the simmering conflict. They count the shells and thankfully few bodies and call it a small and local security crisis encouraged by small and disparate groups of extremists operating across the Kosovo border.</p> <p>But what the statesmen are not seeing is what is in people's minds. In Tetovo every young Albanian man says he is prepared to go up to the woods and join the fighters. They blame discrimination in education, language and in the workplace, but this is a revolution that in Albanian minds at least has been a long time coming.</p> <p>So far the gunmen of the NLA have been playing to the gallery of the world stage. The uprising, as every Albanian will tell you, is about negotiation and 'rights', not ethnic hatred and borders. But as the fighting spreads, so does the potential for another disaster.</p> <p>'I remember after the war in Kosovo was over nearly two years,' says a young Albanian woman in one of Tetovo's bars, 'my friends started behaving and dressing differently. They wanted to be like the Kosovo Liberation Army or Mujahideen.'</p> <p>Locals admit that many of the men had fought in Kosovo, that arms and supplies were coming from the neighbouring province, but they insist this is a local expression of anger against discrimination.</p> <p>The young men in the mountains, she explains, work in her local shops and businesses. And they have risen now because they are afraid they will miss out on any renegotiation of the status of ethnic Albanian areas.</p> <p>But if there is a growing closure of Albanian minds to the possibility of an alternative democratic path to better rights than 'going to the woods', there is also a widespread refusal by many Macedonians to accept that Albanians have genuine grievances. And certainly they do. Unemployment in some Albanian areas runs at almost 60 per cent. They suffer too from discrimination in housing, health, education and social provision. It is most apparent in the issue of official recognition of their language.</p> <p>Tetovo's Restaurant Elektra is a vast empty hall full of deserted tables. In the days of communism it was run by the state for weddings and official celebrations. Now it is a co-operative of which Vojce Stojkovski is the manager. The staff are Bosnian, Albanian, Macedonian and Serb.</p> <p>Stojkovski seems a friendly and reasonable man. He tells us about his Albanian friends and his fears for the future.</p> <p>'To be honest,' he says, 'this all started in Kosovo. We all lived happily together, but it is the younger generation of Albanians that is raising the tensions.</p> <p>'They complain how they are treated, but who is driving the Mercedes and who is driving the Ficas [cheap low-quality Macedonian cars]? It is Albanians who are driving the Mercedes.'</p> <p>On the question of language too, he is equally uncompromising. 'If the majority in Tetovo are Albanian, then I would have to speak Albanian. Where would my equal rights be then? This is Macedonia. We should speak Macedonian.'</p> <p>I repeat Stojkovscki's comment about the Mercedes to a member of the Albanian crisis committee for the Tetovo neighbourhood of Teqe, who declines to be named. 'Tell the Macedonians,' he says, 'that the Mercedes are the reason men are fighting in the woods. Our men have to go abroad to work. They can afford to drive Mercedes because they have been forced to go abroad to work.'</p> <p>Final confirmation of the danger facing Macedonia comes in the strangest place. On the outskirts of the city, a few hundred yards below the NLA's hillside positions, we come across the leader of Macedonia's 10,000 Bektashis - Albanian dervishes - Baba Tahir Emini.</p> <p>A committed pacifist, he warns us of the 'coming catastrophe' unless the rival communities begin to talk.</p> <p>'If someone is crazy,' he says, 'we have to calm them down. We must not shout at them, as the Macedonians are doing with the Albanians. Violence cannot be solved with violence.'</p> <p>He believes, though, that the Albanian gunmen have a case after years of discrimination. 'If I were not a religious man,' he says, 'I would have had to grab a gun and fight.'</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,450658,00.html\">The fighting in Macedonia explained</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/graphic/0,5812,459237,00.html\">Map: where is Tetovo?</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee8064c/0\">Should Nato intervene?</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0320carroll.ra\">Rory</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0320carroll.ra\">Carroll on the mountain massacre threat (2mins 45)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/article/0,5814,387922,00.html\">How do I listen to audio reports?</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/audio/\">More audio reports</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,460071,00.html\">The conflict in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Kosovo/\">Kosovo</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/serbia/0,2759,221850,00.html\">Serbia</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/yugo\">Yugoslavia war crimes</a><br></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,461030,00.html\">22.3.2001:</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,461030,00.html\">Macedonia rejects ceasefire offer</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,461031,00.html\">22.3.2001:</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,461031,00.html\">Britain and US help drive against Albanians</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,461050,00.html\">22.3.2001:</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,461050,00.html\">Fear and suspicion seep into the capital</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,461270,00.html\">22.3.2001, Balkans dispatch: why Nato is ignoring Macedonia</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,460143,00.html\">20.3.2001, comment: Macedonian crisis does not mean war in Balkans</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,459864,00.html\">20.3.2001, leader: Macedonia on its own</a><br></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.gov.mk/english\" target=\"_NEW\">Macedonian government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.morm.gov.mk/granica/nastanie.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Macedonian defence ministry - updates on border clashes</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.al\" target=\"_NEW\">Albanian foreign ministry</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.albanian.com/main/countries/macedonia/\" target=\"_new\">Albania.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.gov.yu/1024/index.html\">Yugoslav government</a><br><a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/news/newstext.asp?4821\" target=\"_NEW\">Foreign secretary Robin Cook's statement on Macedonia</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.kforonline.com/news/updates.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">K-For news updates</a></p>",

It is an imagination that is irreducible to logic or argument. The killing last week of Ramiz, aged 57, and his son Ramadan Koraci, aged 38, in Tetovo by Macedonian police is a case in point. It does not matter to ordinary Albanians that many foreign journalists - this one included - have seen the tapes of Thursday's fatal shooting taken from three different angles, filmed by three different cameramen. Or that it shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that a panicking Ramadan pulled out a grenade as he was hauled from his car, and threw it at police at the moment he was shot. They cannot afford to believe it. Or that we saw the unexploded grenades lying on the ground. At the funeral on Friday on the outskirts of Tetovo, mourners insisted they were murdered in cold blood. The grenades were planted, they say. The photographs faked. What you see in the television footage was a mobile phone in Ramadan's hand. I met his uncle, Mahi Loku, at the funeral. He said: 'This shows these people [the Macedonians] will do anything to insinuate a situation. Ramadan took out his mobile phone, so they killed him. And then, when they dare to commit these acts, the Macedonians complain about what is happening here.' War closes minds. But civil wars also create a lethal new social cohesion even as they exclude 'the other'. And already the communities are lining up behind the gunmen on both sides. On a street corner in front of a row of little kiosks on the outskirts of Tetovo, Macedonia's second city, last Tuesday the Macedonian machine-gunners had sandbagged themselves into a little nest. A group of men and boys squeezed in beside them, sitting on their haunches. They handed the soldiers cold drinks, ran errands and dampened towels for the soldiers to wrap around the steaming barrels of their guns. It is here that the statesmen and spokesmen of the European Union and Nato and the international community - popping into Skopje and Tetovo on their shuttle missions - are missing the point as they dismiss the simmering conflict. They count the shells and thankfully few bodies and call it a small and local security crisis encouraged by small and disparate groups of extremists operating across the Kosovo border. But what the statesmen are not seeing is what is in people's minds. In Tetovo every young Albanian man says he is prepared to go up to the woods and join the fighters. They blame discrimination in education, language and in the workplace, but this is a revolution that in Albanian minds at least has been a long time coming. So far the gunmen of the NLA have been playing to the gallery of the world stage. The uprising, as every Albanian will tell you, is about negotiation and 'rights', not ethnic hatred and borders. But as the fighting spreads, so does the potential for another disaster. 'I remember after the war in Kosovo was over nearly two years,' says a young Albanian woman in one of Tetovo's bars, 'my friends started behaving and dressing differently. They wanted to be like the Kosovo Liberation Army or Mujahideen.' Locals admit that many of the men had fought in Kosovo, that arms and supplies were coming from the neighbouring province, but they insist this is a local expression of anger against discrimination. The young men in the mountains, she explains, work in her local shops and businesses. And they have risen now because they are afraid they will miss out on any renegotiation of the status of ethnic Albanian areas. But if there is a growing closure of Albanian minds to the possibility of an alternative democratic path to better rights than 'going to the woods', there is also a widespread refusal by many Macedonians to accept that Albanians have genuine grievances. And certainly they do. Unemployment in some Albanian areas runs at almost 60 per cent. They suffer too from discrimination in housing, health, education and social provision. It is most apparent in the issue of official recognition of their language. Tetovo's Restaurant Elektra is a vast empty hall full of deserted tables. In the days of communism it was run by the state for weddings and official celebrations. Now it is a co-operative of which Vojce Stojkovski is the manager. The staff are Bosnian, Albanian, Macedonian and Serb. Stojkovski seems a friendly and reasonable man. He tells us about his Albanian friends and his fears for the future. 'To be honest,' he says, 'this all started in Kosovo. We all lived happily together, but it is the younger generation of Albanians that is raising the tensions. 'They complain how they are treated, but who is driving the Mercedes and who is driving the Ficas [cheap low-quality Macedonian cars]? It is Albanians who are driving the Mercedes.' On the question of language too, he is equally uncompromising. 'If the majority in Tetovo are Albanian, then I would have to speak Albanian. Where would my equal rights be then? This is Macedonia. We should speak Macedonian.' I repeat Stojkovscki's comment about the Mercedes to a member of the Albanian crisis committee for the Tetovo neighbourhood of Teqe, who declines to be named. 'Tell the Macedonians,' he says, 'that the Mercedes are the reason men are fighting in the woods. Our men have to go abroad to work. They can afford to drive Mercedes because they have been forced to go abroad to work.' Final confirmation of the danger facing Macedonia comes in the strangest place. On the outskirts of the city, a few hundred yards below the NLA's hillside positions, we come across the leader of Macedonia's 10,000 Bektashis - Albanian dervishes - Baba Tahir Emini. A committed pacifist, he warns us of the 'coming catastrophe' unless the rival communities begin to talk. 'If someone is crazy,' he says, 'we have to calm them down. We must not shout at them, as the Macedonians are doing with the Albanians. Violence cannot be solved with violence.' He believes, though, that the Albanian gunmen have a case after years of discrimination. 'If I were not a religious man,' he says, 'I would have had to grab a gun and fight.' What's going on?

He was not elected President but merely declared it, and received fewer votes overall than the pro-environment Al Gore, not mentioning those cast for the green candidate, Ralph Nader. Bush did, however, get $47 million from energy companies. Several European leaders have made it clear that they will not sit by while the world's environment is mugged by a quirk of America's electoral system. European Commission President Romano Prodi, and Goran Persson, the Swedish Prime Minister, have told Bush he is heading for a clash with Europe. The French, always looking for a scrap with les \u00e9tats Unis, have had to be calmed down. And our leader? Tony Blair has shown he is prepared to do what it takes, such as bomb Baghdad, to earn a place as Bush's acolyte. But the future of the world's climate is more important than this 'special relationship'. Mr Blair must make it clear that this is one issue he won't sweep under the carpet.",

      "body": "<p>The big gold letters above the door at Time Warner's New York headquarters in Rockefeller Plaza now read AOL Time Warner. The additional letters are enough to strike fear into media competitors such as Disney and Viacom, but AOL Time Warner has yet to show that sheer size really matters. </p> <p>Since the merger was approved in January, the combined company has begun integrating. First came a purge of 2,400 jobs, nearly 3 per cent of the combined workforce. Staff were shocked, especially at CNN, where the 400 casualties included a number of prominent correspondents. The manner of the dismissals - people were called into an office one by one and told to be gone within an hour - immediately signalled that AOL's business practices were not those of a caring, new economy company. </p> <p>A lack of transparency and good communication is apparent at AOL Time Warner, but Wall Street approved signs of a serious, profit-orientated merged entity. It 'provides the template for the global diversified media company of tomorrow', enthused Paul Noglows, managing director of JP Morgan H&amp;Q. </p> <p>Mary Meeker, the discredited Queen of the Net, declared: 'AOL Time Warner is our best money-making idea.' She felt a merger that started as a defensive alliance could now become greater than the sum of its parts. </p> <p>Others are less sure. Most analysts believe it will find a way to deliver the $11 billion in gross earnings it has promised Wall Street in 2001, but the synergies promised sound distant. </p> <p>AOLTW's growth strategy depends on the health of the US economy. But it has the luxury of diversified revenues from Time Warner's vast media assets, such as People and Time magazines, CNN and the Warner Music Group. </p> <p>'AOL is the best house in a very bad neighbourhood because it relies the least on advertising,' said analyst Jordan Rohan of the media business website WitSoundView. But advertising revenue was slowing, and it would not be immune. Rohan warned: 'Even the strongest have the wind in their faces.' </p> <p>AOL, with 28 million internet subscribers and carrying a quarter of all US online traffic, must find a way of integrating and improving Time-Warner's content and cable TV systems. This depends on the wide adoption of broadband internet access, which is still rare. </p> <p>The company's aim of maximising cross-medium advertising depends on the health of the economy, and internet advertising generally has all but died out in the last few weeks. </p> <p>'They've talked about combining old media branding capabilities with the internet's ability to provide tools,' says UBS Warburg analyst Christopher Dixon. 'This is not about advertising on the internet,' he cautions, 'but rather, \"How do you enter into a major marketing relationship with these companies and bring something else to the table?\" ' </p> <p>While awaiting Federal Communications Commission approval, AOL's top brass, Steve Case, Gerald Levin and Bob Pittman talked of using the net for promotion, advertising and winning new magazine subscriptions. But observers doubt whether it can squeeze more money from the market while media buyers shun the internet. </p> <p>As Napster fights legal challenges from the music industry, there are signs that AOL and Yahoo are beginning to take their potential as digital music distributors seriously. The expert Kevin Conroy was a surprising choice to head AOL Music since he is an outspoken critic of online distributors such as Napster. He arrived to find a divided operation. Some staff assumed that colleagues were there merely because they were friends of AOL's joint chief executive, Bob Pittman. </p> <p>AOL's approach has been lacking from the start. It has yet to make sense of the online potential of the acquisition of Time-Warner's vast music labels except to slash hundreds of jobs. </p> <p>It has also yet to make sense of its $400 million acquisition of Nullsoft, maker of the Winamp MP3 player, and online radio outlet Spinner.com, beyond offering one-off digital downloads and streaming internet radio channels, chat and message boards and links featured on other internet music sites. Two weeks ago the company said it would place a new Netscape-branded toolbar on its Time, People, Money and Warner Bros websites.

      "bodyText": "The big gold letters above the door at Time Warner's New York headquarters in Rockefeller Plaza now read AOL Time Warner. The additional letters are enough to strike fear into media competitors such as Disney and Viacom, but AOL Time Warner has yet to show that sheer size really matters. Since the merger was approved in January, the combined company has begun integrating. First came a purge of 2,400 jobs, nearly 3 per cent of the combined workforce. Staff were shocked, especially at CNN, where the 400 casualties included a number of prominent correspondents. The manner of the dismissals - people were called into an office one by one and told to be gone within an hour - immediately signalled that AOL's business practices were not those of a caring, new economy company. A lack of transparency and good communication is apparent at AOL Time Warner, but Wall Street approved signs of a serious, profit-orientated merged entity. It 'provides the template for the global diversified media company of tomorrow', enthused Paul Noglows, managing director of JP Morgan H&amp;Q. Mary Meeker, the discredited Queen of the Net, declared: 'AOL Time Warner is our best money-making idea.' She felt a merger that started as a defensive alliance could now become greater than the sum of its parts. Others are less sure. Most analysts believe it will find a way to deliver the $11 billion in gross earnings it has promised Wall Street in 2001, but the synergies promised sound distant. AOLTW's growth strategy depends on the health of the US economy. But it has the luxury of diversified revenues from Time Warner's vast media assets, such as People and Time magazines, CNN and the Warner Music Group. 'AOL is the best house in a very bad neighbourhood because it relies the least on advertising,' said analyst Jordan Rohan of the media business website WitSoundView. But advertising revenue was slowing, and it would not be immune. Rohan warned: 'Even the strongest have the wind in their faces.' AOL, with 28 million internet subscribers and carrying a quarter of all US online traffic, must find a way of integrating and improving Time-Warner's content and cable TV systems. This depends on the wide adoption of broadband internet access, which is still rare. The company's aim of maximising cross-medium advertising depends on the health of the economy, and internet advertising generally has all but died out in the last few weeks. 'They've talked about combining old media branding capabilities with the internet's ability to provide tools,' says UBS Warburg analyst Christopher Dixon. 'This is not about advertising on the internet,' he cautions, 'but rather, \"How do you enter into a major marketing relationship with these companies and bring something else to the table?\" ' While awaiting Federal Communications Commission approval, AOL's top brass, Steve Case, Gerald Levin and Bob Pittman talked of using the net for promotion, advertising and winning new magazine subscriptions. But observers doubt whether it can squeeze more money from the market while media buyers shun the internet. As Napster fights legal challenges from the music industry, there are signs that AOL and Yahoo are beginning to take their potential as digital music distributors seriously. The expert Kevin Conroy was a surprising choice to head AOL Music since he is an outspoken critic of online distributors such as Napster. He arrived to find a divided operation. Some staff assumed that colleagues were there merely because they were friends of AOL's joint chief executive, Bob Pittman. AOL's approach has been lacking from the start. It has yet to make sense of the online potential of the acquisition of Time-Warner's vast music labels except to slash hundreds of jobs. It has also yet to make sense of its $400 million acquisition of Nullsoft, maker of the Winamp MP3 player, and online radio outlet Spinner.com, beyond offering one-off digital downloads and streaming internet radio channels, chat and message boards and links featured on other internet music sites. Two weeks ago the company said it would place a new Netscape-branded toolbar on its Time, People, Money and Warner Bros websites. This will allow surfers to access Netscape features such as messaging, email and online searches. AOLTW's uncertain intentions about digital music were made clear when it released and promptly shut down Gnutella, a peer-to-peer file-swapping system like Napster. The company has been busy working on plans for a music subscription service but is still grappling with such issues as format, copyright protection and how to license music from rival music companies who fear they will not be given the same prominence as AOL Warner artists. Earlier this month, AOLTW reorganised its TV holdings, putting the WB broadcast network and Ted Turner's old empire of cable channels such as CNN in a division headed by Jamie Kellner, founder and chief executive of the WB, a station popular with teenagers with such shows as Seventh Heaven and Dawson's Creek . Besides cutting Turner loose from the empire he created and then sold to Time-Warner, the rationale is to create a rival to the cable-to-grave reach of competitor Viacom, which lures young TV viewers with Nickelodeon, teenagers with MTV, their parents with VH1 and holds older viewers to CBS. 'Clearly, putting the WB into this company fills up this hole and makes it second to none in terms of teens and young-adult reach, which we couldn't say about Turner,' says Pittman. Signalling the new focus on teenagers, the WB successfully ventured into the music realm earlier this year with its latest US version of Popstars, about the making of an all-girl band. There is word that the company hopes to launch a direct rival to MTV, the Viacom cash cow, which has largely ceased broadcasting music videos in favour of teenage-orientated shows.

      "body": "<p>When 14 names drift in and out of the frame for one of the City's most important jobs, you know it's either a plum post or a poisoned chalice. No prizes for guessing which category the chairmanship of Railtrack falls into. </p> <p>But it appears that after five months of scouring, headhunting, offering the job and suffering the ignominy of having it spurned, the beleaguered company has found its man. </p> <p>Railtrack is close to luring Sir John Parker, chairman of the Lattice Group, the gas pipeline business demerged from the old British Gas. He faces what is widely agreed to be the most difficult job in British business today. There can be fewer tasks more daunting and more exposed to the risk of all-round opprobrium. </p> <p>Railtrack is a company in financial crisis at the heart of an industry in disarray, under attack from Government, regulators, passengers and freight customers and with the blood of crash victims on its hands. </p> <p>One institutional shareholder told The Observer this weekend: 'I cannot work out why he wants the job. For a FTSE 100 company you get a whole lot of hubris for a lower quartile salary. You are running a company that is in a huge mess and steeped in liabilities both financial and social. What they should be paying him is \u00a31 million - but then there would be a huge public outcry.' </p> <p>Despite reservations about the job itself, Parker can expect a favourable, if not ecstatic, reception in the City and is expected to orchestrate a shake-up in the boardroom and among senior management in the coming months. </p> <p>Parker stood down as chairman and chief executive last January at the age of 58, and is credited with having turned it in the mid-Nineties from an unfocused company bogged down in cash-hungry projects for little return into a streamlined business. </p> <p>He was also head of Belfast shipyard Harland and Wolff from 1983 to 1993. Despite the grim long-term outlook for Britain's shipbuilding business he pulled in vital orders and steered the yard through privatisation. He went on to head engineering group Babcock. </p> <p>One City source said: 'Parker would not be an absolutely fantastic appointment but is reasonably decent. His reputation in the Square Mile is pretty good. Babcock was in a hell of a mess and he made it better. And he is accustomed to large projects and has skills in heavy capital expenditure, where you are almost betting the company and cannot afford to get it wrong. He is quietly spoken but charismatic.' </p> <p>As Ulsterman Parker has already been knighted, the source joked, there must have been 'at least a double knighthood or more likely a peerage' in the the job description. Parker could be installed within 10 days. At one point it looked as if Railtrack might be trawling for a successful candidate until the annual general meeting in July when Sir Philip Beck departs. The former boss of construction group Mowlem, Beck has appeared so ineffective at the company during its prolonged crisis that he has been dubbed Mr Invisible. </p> <p>Beck was on a basic salary of \u00a3138,000 with a potential annual performance bonus of 50 per cent of salary. But Parker is likely to expect substantially more than this and, although officially in a non-executive, part-time role, will spend more time at Railtrack and be more hands-on than his predecessor. </p> <p>The institutional shareholder said Parker's top three priorities should be sorting out Railtrack's funding shortfall, bonding with Ministers, the Strategic Rail Authority and regulator Tom Winsor, and then dealing with the 'nuts and bolts' of the organisation. </p> <p>'You have to ask whether the current management team is up to the task of managing the rail network. Parker will bring people in and it will be interesting to see what kind of pulling power he has. I think it could take two or three years to turn Railtrack around,' said the shareholder. </p> <p>Parker already knows SRA chairman Sir Alastair Morton and has reportedly had the nod of approval from him and Government ministers - vital as the company tries to rehabilitate itself. </p> <p>Railtrack will this week attempt to resolve its immediate cash shortfall with the Government. It hopes to draw forward \u00a31.5 billion of \u00a315bn of taxpayers money expected to be paid over the next five years. </p> <p>It is currently in danger of losing its 'A' credit rating, falling behind on its core maintenance programme and being unable to compensate train operators for losses resulting from last year's Hatfield crash. </p> <p>If it had to borrow money in the capital markets to cover the shortfall, as opposed to being bailed out by the Government, it would be in danger of breaching its banking covenants next year after building up \u00a38bn of debt. </p> <p>Railtrack also needs to recover to the point where it can hold a rights issue to raise money to support the modernisation and expansion of the network over the next five to 10 years. </p> <p>Jim Steer, managing director of rail consultancy Steer Davies Gleave, said the new chairman would have to decide whether Railtrack's primary purpose was to its private sector shareholders or to the public interest as controller of the network. </p> <p>The company has admitted setting too much store by the City institutions. </p> <p>It has been roundly criticised for being at best incompetent and at worst obstructive in its relationships with the train operators, the rolling stock manufacturers and the maintenance contractors. It has been accused of failing the fare-paying passenger and the taxpayer as 'stakeholders'. </p> <p>So Railtrack needs a root and branch transformation that keeps it as a privatised national network owner separated from the operators - avoiding a long haul through fresh legislation - but improves its external relationships, raises service levels and boosts staff morale. </p> <p>It is the job of the chief executive, Steve Marshall, to organise the staff in their safety and operational roles as owner of the track, signals and stations as well as overseeing maintenance and capital projects, such as the West Coast Mainline modernisation and the Channel Tunnel rail link. </p> <p>But after the Ladbroke Grove crash in 1999 and last year's Hatfield derailment and subsequent paralysis of the network, a strong chairman will be needed behind his chief executive to face the Government, the media, the regulators, the public and the punchdrunk employees. </p> <p>One senior industry figure said this weekend: 'Just think of the problems.

      "bodyText": "When 14 names drift in and out of the frame for one of the City's most important jobs, you know it's either a plum post or a poisoned chalice. No prizes for guessing which category the chairmanship of Railtrack falls into. But it appears that after five months of scouring, headhunting, offering the job and suffering the ignominy of having it spurned, the beleaguered company has found its man. Railtrack is close to luring Sir John Parker, chairman of the Lattice Group, the gas pipeline business demerged from the old British Gas. He faces what is widely agreed to be the most difficult job in British business today. There can be fewer tasks more daunting and more exposed to the risk of all-round opprobrium. Railtrack is a company in financial crisis at the heart of an industry in disarray, under attack from Government, regulators, passengers and freight customers and with the blood of crash victims on its hands. One institutional shareholder told The Observer this weekend: 'I cannot work out why he wants the job. For a FTSE 100 company you get a whole lot of hubris for a lower quartile salary. You are running a company that is in a huge mess and steeped in liabilities both financial and social. What they should be paying him is \u00a31 million - but then there would be a huge public outcry.' Despite reservations about the job itself, Parker can expect a favourable, if not ecstatic, reception in the City and is expected to orchestrate a shake-up in the boardroom and among senior management in the coming months. Parker stood down as chairman and chief executive last January at the age of 58, and is credited with having turned it in the mid-Nineties from an unfocused company bogged down in cash-hungry projects for little return into a streamlined business. He was also head of Belfast shipyard Harland and Wolff from 1983 to 1993. Despite the grim long-term outlook for Britain's shipbuilding business he pulled in vital orders and steered the yard through privatisation. He went on to head engineering group Babcock. One City source said: 'Parker would not be an absolutely fantastic appointment but is reasonably decent. His reputation in the Square Mile is pretty good. Babcock was in a hell of a mess and he made it better. And he is accustomed to large projects and has skills in heavy capital expenditure, where you are almost betting the company and cannot afford to get it wrong. He is quietly spoken but charismatic.' As Ulsterman Parker has already been knighted, the source joked, there must have been 'at least a double knighthood or more likely a peerage' in the the job description. Parker could be installed within 10 days. At one point it looked as if Railtrack might be trawling for a successful candidate until the annual general meeting in July when Sir Philip Beck departs. The former boss of construction group Mowlem, Beck has appeared so ineffective at the company during its prolonged crisis that he has been dubbed Mr Invisible. Beck was on a basic salary of \u00a3138,000 with a potential annual performance bonus of 50 per cent of salary. But Parker is likely to expect substantially more than this and, although officially in a non-executive, part-time role, will spend more time at Railtrack and be more hands-on than his predecessor. The institutional shareholder said Parker's top three priorities should be sorting out Railtrack's funding shortfall, bonding with Ministers, the Strategic Rail Authority and regulator Tom Winsor, and then dealing with the 'nuts and bolts' of the organisation. 'You have to ask whether the current management team is up to the task of managing the rail network. Parker will bring people in and it will be interesting to see what kind of pulling power he has. I think it could take two or three years to turn Railtrack around,' said the shareholder. Parker already knows SRA chairman Sir Alastair Morton and has reportedly had the nod of approval from him and Government ministers - vital as the company tries to rehabilitate itself. Railtrack will this week attempt to resolve its immediate cash shortfall with the Government. It hopes to draw forward \u00a31.5 billion of \u00a315bn of taxpayers money expected to be paid over the next five years. It is currently in danger of losing its 'A' credit rating, falling behind on its core maintenance programme and being unable to compensate train operators for losses resulting from last year's Hatfield crash. If it had to borrow money in the capital markets to cover the shortfall, as opposed to being bailed out by the Government, it would be in danger of breaching its banking covenants next year after building up \u00a38bn of debt. Railtrack also needs to recover to the point where it can hold a rights issue to raise money to support the modernisation and expansion of the network over the next five to 10 years. Jim Steer, managing director of rail consultancy Steer Davies Gleave, said the new chairman would have to decide whether Railtrack's primary purpose was to its private sector shareholders or to the public interest as controller of the network. The company has admitted setting too much store by the City institutions. It has been roundly criticised for being at best incompetent and at worst obstructive in its relationships with the train operators, the rolling stock manufacturers and the maintenance contractors. It has been accused of failing the fare-paying passenger and the taxpayer as 'stakeholders'. So Railtrack needs a root and branch transformation that keeps it as a privatised national network owner separated from the operators - avoiding a long haul through fresh legislation - but improves its external relationships, raises service levels and boosts staff morale. It is the job of the chief executive, Steve Marshall, to organise the staff in their safety and operational roles as owner of the track, signals and stations as well as overseeing maintenance and capital projects, such as the West Coast Mainline modernisation and the Channel Tunnel rail link. But after the Ladbroke Grove crash in 1999 and last year's Hatfield derailment and subsequent paralysis of the network, a strong chairman will be needed behind his chief executive to face the Government, the media, the regulators, the public and the punchdrunk employees. One senior industry figure said this weekend: 'Just think of the problems. This is a dysfunctional organisation: cash is haemorrhaging out of the door and senior executives are disaffected. There is no stability and no long-term investment basis established - and it seems that the Treasury and the SRA are now in charge. This is the most enormous challenge for a chairman.' Quite a big job then? 'Think of the biggest corporate turnaround ever and then double it,' he said. Railtrack faces \u00a31.2bn bill",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Sir Anthony Hammond was so busy, busy, busy last month clearing absolutely everyone in Government over the Hinduja affair that he had no time to speak to the key witnesses. 'I have not interviewed any of the Hinduja brothers,' he writes in his report to the Prime Minister. 'There were obvious practical difficulties in visiting them in India.' Yes, and sea monsters had eaten all the phone lines to the sub-continent, I assume. </p> <p>If on his way to investigate the Hinduja-funded Spirit Zone at the Millennium Dome Sir Anthony hadn't been as hurried as the March Hare, I would have invited him on The Observer 's special tour of the Dome. Had he followed me through the doorway marked 'Privileged Access', he might have asked whether there was a flea market in favours surrounding Geoffrey Robinson, Peter Mandelson, John Prescott and others at the top of a Government obsessed with funding the Greenwich sinkhole and other New Labour projects. But Sir Anthony was not asked to ask questions about the Dome. </p> <p>June 1998 was One Amazing Month. Besides juggling Hinduja requests, the Government had to squeeze in the secret meetings with Tesco. John Prescott's Transportation Task Force was to announce a plan for a tax on shopping centre car parks; it would cost Tesco upwards of \u00a320 million a year. Tesco's lobbyists described how the retailer 'repositioned' after a Dome pledge, and the wording of the Task Force report was supposedly redrafted to exempt Tesco from the tax. </p> <p>Did the Dome dosh influence the tax break decision? Both the Government and Tesco say no. A government spokesman protested that Tesco made its pledge to the Dome in February, months before the Government had considered the tax. Not so, said Tesco's lobbyists (not knowing The Observer team was recording them). They had 'intelligence' about the tax from government insiders at least three months before they announced the Dome donation. So while there's no evidence that Tesco made the donation to get its way over the car park tax, advance knowledge of the proposal must have helped the tax break campaign. </p> <p>In June 1998, the Government was about to boot US-based Gtech from its National Lottery work following a libel jury's finding that Gtech's then CEO tried to bribe Richard Branson. But then... </p> <p>'The Government needed someone to sell tickets for this ridiculous Millennium Dome thing that my old boss [Mandelson] is building. Gtech has offered to do that via the National Lottery selling equipment,' said lobbyist Derek Draper into my concealed tape recorder. </p> <p>And it came to pass that Gtech provided the valuable national ticket-selling network for the Dome, without charge, and the Prime Minister went back on his election pledge to boot the tainted American firm from the Lottery. Camelot, which operates the Gtech machinery, says that contract renewal was 'not the reason' it helped the Dome. </p> <p>Sir Anthony asked no questions of Mandelson nor anyone else about alleged Dome deals in that busy, busy month of June 1998 other than in relation to the Hindujas. Sir Anthony was asked not to ask by the Prime Minister. By limiting the investigation's terms of reference, the PM effectively guided Sir Anthony blindfolded into the Hinduja Spirit Zone with orders to ignore any dripping knives, headless corpses, and bloody howls emanating from the other zones of the Government's cash-for-access funhouse. In that same month of June, The Observer learned that Robinson, then a Treasury official, held a secret meeting with the CEO of PowerGen Corporation. </p> <p>Its lobbyist says it discussed a scheme to trade approval for a three-way merger between PowerGen, East Midlands Electricity, and a US power firm. In return, the new mega-company would support another New Labour project: contracts for the UK coal industry. Trade and Industry Secretary Margaret Beckett, by law in charge of the matter, was kept in the dark about this alleged soto voce bargain. </p> <p>And, lo, it came to pass that the PowerGen East-Midlands merger (without the US company, which dropped out) was approved, but only after Blair bounced Beckett out of her ministry and replaced her, in September, with one Peter Mandelson. The day after Mandelson approved the merger, PowerGen signed the coal contracts. A Robinson chat with PowerGen about coal mines and energy policy is utterly legit. But if Robinson mixed in the quasi-judicial decision about mergers and passed that on to Mandy for action, isn't that worth an investigator's question or two? Sir Anthony would not be so rude as to ask. </p> <p>The Hammond investigation, as the late, great baseball player Yogi Berra would have said, is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. </p> <p>In August 1999, Lord Neill's Parliamentary Committee on Standards in Public Life was offered evidence of possible favours for Dome donors and the Robinson meeting but, 'the committee,' its spokesman said, 'believes the subject matter was thoroughly covered in the testimony of Derek Draper'. </p> <p>PowerGen lobbyist Draper, listed by the committee as 'former aide to the Rt Hon Peter Mandelson MP', assured the committee there was 'certainly no systematic corruption going on'. And that settled the matter. The committee may have reached the right conclusion, but the lack of hard questioning means we can never be certain. </p> <p>Contrast Sir Anthony's relaxed questioning of Mandelson to the grilling of Bill Clinton this month over the ex-President's pardon of fugitive Marc Rich.

      "bodyText": "Sir Anthony Hammond was so busy, busy, busy last month clearing absolutely everyone in Government over the Hinduja affair that he had no time to speak to the key witnesses. 'I have not interviewed any of the Hinduja brothers,' he writes in his report to the Prime Minister. 'There were obvious practical difficulties in visiting them in India.' Yes, and sea monsters had eaten all the phone lines to the sub-continent, I assume. If on his way to investigate the Hinduja-funded Spirit Zone at the Millennium Dome Sir Anthony hadn't been as hurried as the March Hare, I would have invited him on The Observer 's special tour of the Dome. Had he followed me through the doorway marked 'Privileged Access', he might have asked whether there was a flea market in favours surrounding Geoffrey Robinson, Peter Mandelson, John Prescott and others at the top of a Government obsessed with funding the Greenwich sinkhole and other New Labour projects. But Sir Anthony was not asked to ask questions about the Dome. June 1998 was One Amazing Month. Besides juggling Hinduja requests, the Government had to squeeze in the secret meetings with Tesco. John Prescott's Transportation Task Force was to announce a plan for a tax on shopping centre car parks; it would cost Tesco upwards of \u00a320 million a year. Tesco's lobbyists described how the retailer 'repositioned' after a Dome pledge, and the wording of the Task Force report was supposedly redrafted to exempt Tesco from the tax. Did the Dome dosh influence the tax break decision? Both the Government and Tesco say no. A government spokesman protested that Tesco made its pledge to the Dome in February, months before the Government had considered the tax. Not so, said Tesco's lobbyists (not knowing The Observer team was recording them). They had 'intelligence' about the tax from government insiders at least three months before they announced the Dome donation. So while there's no evidence that Tesco made the donation to get its way over the car park tax, advance knowledge of the proposal must have helped the tax break campaign. In June 1998, the Government was about to boot US-based Gtech from its National Lottery work following a libel jury's finding that Gtech's then CEO tried to bribe Richard Branson. But then... 'The Government needed someone to sell tickets for this ridiculous Millennium Dome thing that my old boss [Mandelson] is building. Gtech has offered to do that via the National Lottery selling equipment,' said lobbyist Derek Draper into my concealed tape recorder. And it came to pass that Gtech provided the valuable national ticket-selling network for the Dome, without charge, and the Prime Minister went back on his election pledge to boot the tainted American firm from the Lottery. Camelot, which operates the Gtech machinery, says that contract renewal was 'not the reason' it helped the Dome. Sir Anthony asked no questions of Mandelson nor anyone else about alleged Dome deals in that busy, busy month of June 1998 other than in relation to the Hindujas. Sir Anthony was asked not to ask by the Prime Minister. By limiting the investigation's terms of reference, the PM effectively guided Sir Anthony blindfolded into the Hinduja Spirit Zone with orders to ignore any dripping knives, headless corpses, and bloody howls emanating from the other zones of the Government's cash-for-access funhouse. In that same month of June, The Observer learned that Robinson, then a Treasury official, held a secret meeting with the CEO of PowerGen Corporation. Its lobbyist says it discussed a scheme to trade approval for a three-way merger between PowerGen, East Midlands Electricity, and a US power firm. In return, the new mega-company would support another New Labour project: contracts for the UK coal industry. Trade and Industry Secretary Margaret Beckett, by law in charge of the matter, was kept in the dark about this alleged soto voce bargain. And, lo, it came to pass that the PowerGen East-Midlands merger (without the US company, which dropped out) was approved, but only after Blair bounced Beckett out of her ministry and replaced her, in September, with one Peter Mandelson. The day after Mandelson approved the merger, PowerGen signed the coal contracts. A Robinson chat with PowerGen about coal mines and energy policy is utterly legit. But if Robinson mixed in the quasi-judicial decision about mergers and passed that on to Mandy for action, isn't that worth an investigator's question or two? Sir Anthony would not be so rude as to ask. The Hammond investigation, as the late, great baseball player Yogi Berra would have said, is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. In August 1999, Lord Neill's Parliamentary Committee on Standards in Public Life was offered evidence of possible favours for Dome donors and the Robinson meeting but, 'the committee,' its spokesman said, 'believes the subject matter was thoroughly covered in the testimony of Derek Draper'. PowerGen lobbyist Draper, listed by the committee as 'former aide to the Rt Hon Peter Mandelson MP', assured the committee there was 'certainly no systematic corruption going on'. And that settled the matter. The committee may have reached the right conclusion, but the lack of hard questioning means we can never be certain. Contrast Sir Anthony's relaxed questioning of Mandelson to the grilling of Bill Clinton this month over the ex-President's pardon of fugitive Marc Rich. Clinton and his White House aides had to withstand withering questions before a hostile Congress, under oath and the television lights. The inquisition exposed an extraordinary web of cash transfers to Clinton projects and a lobbying operation entangling the Prime Minister of Israel and the King of Spain. It is no accident that the names of foreigners such as Hinduja, and more often than not American operators, pop up in tales of cash for access. Outsiders, lacking family links and old school ties, need blunt instruments and insider contacts to break into Britain's power elite, one of the planet's oldest and sturdiest economic oligarchies. The American body politic is at least as corroded by cash for access as Britain's. But Americans don't grow up inculcated with illusions about the integrity of their leaders (excepting the dead ones on Mount Rushmore). Our inquiries are handled with the assumption that our leaders are rotten, it's just a matter of figuring to which vice they succumbed. If Britain's ruling gentlemen are now going to play US-style influence games, the public will need US-style investigations. Yogi Berra could have explained this to Sir Anthony. As he once said: it's amazing how much you can see when you're looking. gregory.palast@observer.co.uk",

Nearly three years after the bomb devastated the town and shocked the world, the Omagh Legal Fund has collected less than \u00a3160,000 towards the cost of a civil prosecution of the alleged perpetrators, woefully short of its \u00a31 million target. The Observer has also learnt that millions of pounds already raised to help the Omagh victims cannot be used to pay for the civil action against the suspects because it does not constitute a charitable cause. Families of those killed by the bomb, the worst single atrocity of the Troubles, said \u00a3100,000 had already been spent on legal fees, leaving \u00a360,000 in the fund. They have less than six months to raise the rest; the law allows victims three years from the date of a crime to mount private actions against those believed to be responsible. Many are angry at being unable to use \u00a31.5 million raised by music and sports stars such as The Corrs and Manchester United for the Omagh Fund, because the money was designated for charitable use only: \u00a33 million has already been distributed to 400 people caught up in the atrocity. Victor Barker, whose 12-year-old son James was killed, said he was saddened at public 'indifference' over the fundraising effort. 'It's because it's to do with Northern Ireland, and that is very sad,' he said. 'People in Britain are less inclined to help as a result. They just want to keep it away from their own doorstep.

Barker, an English solicitor based in Surrey, left Ireland last year, disgusted at the failure of the police on both sides of the border to prosecute the Real IRA figures believed to have carried out the attack.

Although the RUC and the Garda Siochana have built up a meticulous portrait of the gang, they say there is little chance of a conviction. \u0095 Donations can be sent to: Royal Bank of Scotland, Fleet Street Branch, London EC4 Sort code: 16-00-11 Account number: 100 84 990 Account name: Omagh Victims Legal Trust",

Nobody wanting it, nobody buying into it any more? 'Exactly,' he said. A Wall Street crash of maleness? 'Well, yes,' he said. </p> <p>It was certainly easy to paint a vivid sociological picture. Girls thrashing boys at school. Women still paid less, but also more adaptable and therefore more saleable in the workplace. Women instigating most live-in relationships, but women ending the vast majority of them, too. Femaleness prospering, evolving, moving on, swinging a jaunty briefcase. Maleness on the ropes, skidding belligerently and pathetically in its own bloody, beery juices. Exactly how attractive these somewhat simplistic scenarios seem probably depends on how much you're hating men at the moment. How much of a misandrist you are. </p> <p>The title of Nigel Planer's new novel is Faking It, but the working title was The Misandrists. A misandrist being 'one who hates men'. Planer has complained that the misandrist hasn't got anywhere near the swanky high profile of the misogynist ('one who hates women') and that, furthermore, negative male imagery is everywhere. </p> <p>Before we begin, it has to be seen as a bit rich for Planer to be moaning about media-generated images of male inadequacy. What was your most famous role again, Nigel? Oh yes, Neil from The Young Ones, that colossus of masculine integrity, and role model for little boys everywhere. As for Planer's other main point, it could be counter-argued that, since time immemorial, men have hated women far more systematically and efficiently than women have ever hated men. Ergo, it's understandable that their word for hating us should beat ours for hating them. Give us time, guys. </p> <p>That said, Planer has a point. It has to be seen as interesting that misandrist is perceived as such a second-division word that it doesn't even make it into most good dictionaries. In a way, this oversight can only be good news for women. It reminds one of Queen Victoria and lesbianism - it never crossed her mind that such a thing existed, so British lesbians rather wonderfully escaped the criminalisation that was the lot of the homosexual man. </p> <p>However, just like Victorian dykes, 'those who hate men' do exist in modern society, even if they lack a label. Moreover, just like misogynists, misandrists come in male and female varieties, with certain men hating each other, and themselves, just as much, if not more, than any woman could possibly be bothered to hate them. Which is probably where the real trouble starts. While women tend to only 'hate men' in short frenzied bursts after one too many glasses of Chablis, when men hate themselves, they tend to do it sober, and take it far too seriously. </p> <p>It seems to be a matter of getting used to something. While women have been enraged and frustrated by men for centuries, bitching about their menfolk even as they bore their children and scrubbed their smalls, men have only recently come to terms with their own limitations. Hence the emergence of 80s New Man (the abject apology for the sins of past decades) and 90s New Lad (the abrupt taking back of the apology). All of which could only have made the average sentient female over-10 laugh indulgently, but which probably confused the hell out of the boys. Now, in 2001, we seem to have bypassed all attempts at male maturity and come to the all-time low of New Baby Boy. </p> <p>He is a bit like New Man (he means well) and New Lad (a guy's got to have a pint), but with a creepy new infantile twist. Every time New Baby Boy is given a ribbing from the girls, he'll run off, blubbing, and telling tales to the media. Astonishing, really. When women felt that they were being oppressed and denigrated, they organised and fought back. Now that men feel the same way, they wail to the press about how badly they are being treated, and how confused they are. </p> <p>Men seem to have not yet learned, as women were forced to do, that self-esteem is not something you can hang on to. It is, at its most tangible, like a butterfly cupped in the hand - the harder you squeeze, the sooner it's dead. Moreover, it is unlikely that maleness is any more denigrated by women than it once was. Men are just sulking about it more these days. Which may in part account for why male stock seems to be going down faster than you can say dotcom millionaire. In the gender playground, like any other, no one likes a telltale, and even fewer care for snivellers.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk\">barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Canary-yellow bus shelters have flowered along Kosovo's roads. Last summer there were none. Now, at every village, outside every town, a few Kosovars stand waiting, sticking out their thumbs hopefully at passing cars.</p> <p>As quickly as they have appeared they have been daubed with Ukshin Hoti's name. It is a configuration that speaks volumes of Kosovo two years after Nato's jets pounded the Serb army and police; three years after the massacre of the Jashari clan by Serb police that led to the Kosovo Liberation Army's fateful uprising.</p> <p>If Kosovo's new bus stops are a visible sign of the beginning of a return to civic society, the scrawl of Ukshin Hoti's name signifies the problems that remain. Ukshin Hoti is one of the missing in a country that is alive with ghosts. An ethnic Albanian political activist, Ukshin Hoti was released from a prison sentence in the southern town of Prizren during the bombing. The Serbs were waiting. He has not been seen since.</p> <p>Louis Quail's portraits on these pages tell the story of Kosovo's conundrum: a territory trapped by its unresolved contradictions. It is a non-state: neither part of the Serb-dominated rump of Yugoslavia nor yet independent. It is a place, too, of pervasive violence - against ethnic Serbs and Albanians alike - and of guerilla insurrections on its borders. And this time it is Albanians who are carrying out the violence.</p> <p>The lives, though, of most Kosovars have been transfigured. They are free to work and study, to love and live, and pursue the project of establishing a national iden- tity after a decade of political violence and repression. Above all, these portraits remind us that, beyond the images of violence, Kosovo remains a space for ordinary human aspirations.</p> <p>I first visited the town of Djakova in 1998 during the first summer of the KLA uprising. Its old town was a maze of narrow cobbled streets, faced off by small wooden-fronted shops, restaurants and coffee houses. It was always a largely Albanian town. So when Nato started bombing, it was the first place the Serb paramilitaries hit. They burned the wooden shops of the old town and slaughtered the families of the men they suspected of being KLA.</p> <p>Today the shops are being rebuilt. Not fast enough, however, to hide the scars that remain. There are other wounds, too, that will never heal. In their family compound not far from the old town, Louis Quail photographed Ardit Koci, aged seven, holding a picture of his missing father Vlera, who was taken by the Serbs in May 1999. Like Ukshin Hoti, he had been imprisoned for political activism. Like Ukshin Hoti, they came for him during the bombing. Like Ukshin Hoti, he has not been seen since.</p> <p>His name is not on the list of those still imprisoned in Serbia for 'terrorism', of those released in the recent amnesty, or among the names of the dead. When we knock at the door, it is his elderly mother who answers. I have Louis's portrait, which I show to Luljeta, Vlera's widow, to remind her of the photographer's visit. But Nazlije, the mother, is confused.</p> <p>'Have you seen him?' she demands. 'Have you any news of my son?'</p> <p>'He was a driver with a clinic,' explains Luljeta later, as we sit drinking coffee in the main room of their house. Ardit, suffering from flu, lies wrapped in a blanket on another sofa. 'Vlera had been politically active and he had been imprisoned. When he was released he had no chance of proper work.</p> <p>'I last saw him on 10 May. They came and arrested him at the house of a friend. There were 30 people hiding in our house, but he was worried that they were looking for the men so he went to hide elsewhere.'</p> <p>Agim, a cousin, believes that the family cannot face the future until his fate has been resolved. 'We could face the future if only we knew what had happened to the missing.'</p> <p>But it is not only the missing who haunt Djakova. In April 1999, standing on Kosovo's border with Albania, I came across Dren Saka, then aged 10, only survivor of a massacre by Serb paramilitaries at a house on the outskirts of the old town. Nineteen people died that day. Dren survived only because he raised his arm to cover his face as a Serb paramilitary took aim at his head. The bullet was stopped by the bone in his arm and he crawled to hide in a smoke-filled room as the Serbs finished the killing.</p> <p>Dren now lives in Canada. But the owner of the house, the only survivor of his immediate family, has returned to live there after spending a year in Belgium. We find Lulzim Vejsa in the little caf\u00e9 he owns next to his family compound. Lulzim lost his wife, his five children, his sister and her three children, his mother and an uncle in the killing. With Dren's father Ali Saka and some other men, he was hiding out in a neighbouring building when the killings happened. Ali and Lulzim thought the Serbs were coming for the men and it was safer for everyone if they were hidden. He was wrong.</p> <p>At 35, he is a pale man, with a soft and gentle face. His eyes are hollowed out by grief. He clasps his hands before him as we speak to control a tremor in his hands. He takes us to see the cellar where his family was hiding when the killers came, and shows the new house he has built on the ruins of the old.</p> <p>'When I came back, there was a lot of talk in the town. People said I could not live here again after what happened,' he explains. 'But I wanted to show them. Originally, a Canadian aid agency wanted to build a clinic on the site. I wanted to build a monument. But we could not agree, so I decided I would rebuild the house.'</p> <p>As we talk, I am reminded of what Dren Saka told me after he had been shot: how he recognised the killers as Serb neighbours from the area. Lulzim pulls out his wallet and produces a piece of paper with a scrawled list of names. They are the men he believes murdered his family and friends.</p> <p>He has, he says, unfinished business. He would like to see these men tried before the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague. He also has unfinished business with the future. 'I would like to start all over,' he tells us. 'I hope that somehow the future will be better. I can go abroad if I want. But I want to stay.' I ask him if he has any fears for the future. 'I have no fear,' says Lulzim. 'What else can I do but continue?'</p> <p>Kosovo today is not just a place of loss and mourning. It is also a place of vibrant new beginnings. Pristina's Boro Ramiz shopping centre is full of new boutiques. Restaurants such as Tiffany's - once the favoured watering place of the international media and aid workers, and burned out by the Serbs in the days after Nato began its bombing - have reopened in new locations. Theatre, music and the media are flourishing.</p> <p>One evening, I meet up with a friend, Memli Krasniqi, Kosovo's biggest rap star whose highly political songs have provided a musical backdrop for young Albanians during their years of trouble. When we first met a few weeks before Nato's bombing, he could not leave his flat after dark for fear of his Serbian neighbours. Now Memli is making music again, performing around the country. We drink and dine and wander through the snow-covered streets of Pristina accompanied by the young brother of my translator and one of his friends - both fans of Memli's. Conversation turns to an enthusiastic debate about the lyrics of Eminem.</p> <p>Memli's problems now are not gunmen on the neighbouring balconies firing drunkenly in the dark. Some are quotidian. He complains about a lack of royalties in a non-state that has no mechanism for collecting fees for radio and TV. Where once he sang about the horrors of ethnic cleansing and communal violence, his new songs gnaw at the issue on which all Kosovars can agree: frustration at the way they feel the international community is keeping them from independence.</p> <p>It is a subject that comes up again and again. I ask everyone I meet what would make life better: 'Independence,' they reply. I ask them whether they can ever live again with the Serbs - who, like Bratislav Savic, cling to a desperate, threatened existence in their remaining enclaves protected by the troops of the international peace-keeping force, KFor. They answer: 'No.'</p> <p>In the Grand Hotel, Pristina's ugly monument to hotel architecture of the Cold War, I ask Sanie Krasniqi, who runs the hairdressing salon, how her life has changed for the better. 'Before the war, this hotel was run by Serbs,' she says. 'Now it is run by Albanians.' Sanie, 53, and her husband, who runs the barber's shop next door, were thrown out of Pristina during the bombing. In the 10 years of Serb repression after 1989, tens of thousands of Albanians were thrown out of their jobs. Sanie who cut hair at the Grand until 1989, was among them. After that she cut hair with a group of friends in local people's houses. Now she is running her own business back at the hotel where she started.</p> <p>'For me,' she says, preparing to perm a customer, 'the biggest change is that I feel free. I don't feel I have to be scared of my neighbours any more. My biggest hope is independence and all the good things that should come with it. My biggest fear? That we do not win independence.'</p> <p>The arrival of KFor - spearheaded by Nato forces - also transformed the life of Haki Shala and his family on their farm in a village near the ethnically divided town of Lipljan. Before the Serb forces were driven out, the Shalas farmed the land, barely surviving. Now a couple of bulldozers sit in front of his door, testament to the new business he has built up with his cousins: reconstructing houses destroyed by Serb forces.</p> <p>The Shala home is a traditional one. In the main room the men sit around the wood-burning stove on cushions placed around the walls, feet tucked beneath them to avoid offence. The room is hung with flags of the KLA, the Stars and Stripes, and Union Jacks. The family will never forget the time of Nato's bombing. Then, 15 soldiers of the Yugoslav army camped out in their cellar for weeks on end, threatening the family and getting drunk. Once the soldiers took them to where they had made an excavation near the farm and told them that this is where their bodies would be dumped.</p> <p>'We're free now,' says Haki, 'but the children will never forget. Sometimes they wake up in the night remembering the times when the soldiers were here. We will not forget the horror of what the Serbs did until we die.' He is dubious about how Serbs and Kosovars can ever live together. 'All of the Serbs in Kosovo and the former Yugoslavia were persuaded to hate Albanians. It will be difficult to live together.'</p> <p>Of all the subjects of Louis Quail's portraits, there is one I am desperate to find. He is Mexit Gurdina - 'The Man who Loves the Woods'. It is a soubriquet supplied by another resident of the city of Prizren as we ask for his address.</p> <p>In Kosovo, few people use addresses, so when we stop a young man in the street to seek directions he asks us instead who we are searching for. 'Ah, the man who loves the woods,' he says and gives us directions that take us to a narrow street just past the ancient Turkish baths. Quail spotted Mexit, a 51-year-old mechanic, on a chilly autumn day standing by a gorge in his swimming trunks and brewing up his tea. When we call, he is out skiing in the woods. Mexit, who has been walking, skiing and swimming in the outdoors since he was 13 years old, does not share the optimism of most Kosovars over Kosovo's future.</p> <p>'All through the war I never stopped going swimming, walking and skiing. I only stopped when I was turned back with a gun,' he says. 'Even then I would try and go around the checkpoints.' He turns gloomy for a moment. 'There is not much pleasure here now. I feel we are going to be poor. Crime is increasing. I am worried - we are all worried - about the future. That's why I walk and ski and swim. To forget my fears.'</p>",

Once the soldiers took them to where they had made an excavation near the farm and told them that this is where their bodies would be dumped. 'We're free now,' says Haki, 'but the children will never forget. Sometimes they wake up in the night remembering the times when the soldiers were here. We will not forget the horror of what the Serbs did until we die.' He is dubious about how Serbs and Kosovars can ever live together. 'All of the Serbs in Kosovo and the former Yugoslavia were persuaded to hate Albanians. It will be difficult to live together.' Of all the subjects of Louis Quail's portraits, there is one I am desperate to find. He is Mexit Gurdina - 'The Man who Loves the Woods'. It is a soubriquet supplied by another resident of the city of Prizren as we ask for his address. In Kosovo, few people use addresses, so when we stop a young man in the street to seek directions he asks us instead who we are searching for. 'Ah, the man who loves the woods,' he says and gives us directions that take us to a narrow street just past the ancient Turkish baths. Quail spotted Mexit, a 51-year-old mechanic, on a chilly autumn day standing by a gorge in his swimming trunks and brewing up his tea. When we call, he is out skiing in the woods. Mexit, who has been walking, skiing and swimming in the outdoors since he was 13 years old, does not share the optimism of most Kosovars over Kosovo's future. 'All through the war I never stopped going swimming, walking and skiing. I only stopped when I was turned back with a gun,' he says. 'Even then I would try and go around the checkpoints.' He turns gloomy for a moment. 'There is not much pleasure here now. I feel we are going to be poor. Crime is increasing. I am worried - we are all worried - about the future. That's why I walk and ski and swim. To forget my fears.'",

      "trailText": "<p>Three weeks ago Sue Townsend, author of the bestselling Adrian Mole books, was declared totally blind. In this remarkable interview with  <strong>Nicci Gerrard</strong> she talks for the first time about the new world she inhabits - and her plans for a fabulous pair of dark glasses.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Her house is crammed full of objects: paintings on every brightly painted wall; pale pink tulips in jugs; bowls and cups and odd little knick-knacks and pieces of bric-a-brac here, there and everywhere; photographs of her family whose faces she can no longer see; messages pinned on notice boards; books that she can no longer read on shelves and in piles on the floor; mirrors throwing back the reflection of her face that has become invisible to her. </p> <p>The great comic novelist Sue Townsend - aged 55 and a half - has gone blind. </p> <p>She has a white stick, an intense gaze that can no longer meet your own. She falls over her black Labrador, drops blocks of knives on to her foot, loses jewellery, earrings and keys, feels her way around the house she's lived in for years, bumps into chairs, talks to the coat hanging on the back of the door thinking it's her husband, Colin (the woman who mistook her husband for a mac). </p> <p>She says, as she sits in her study, at her desk where she used to write, that sometimes she feels invisible, sometimes she feels lost, sometimes she feels a sense of panic. But 'I've always loved change', she adds. 'And this is certainly a change.' She gives her throaty smoker's chuckle. 'It's quite exciting really. I'm trying to work out how to turn it to my advantage. I will, you know.' I know. </p> <p>Fifteen years ago, Sue Townsend became a diabetic - 'an everyday kind of thing, but there are lots of dangers attendant on it, like heart attacks [she's had one of those], kidney failure, amputations. And loss of sight.' </p> <p>A few years ago tiny blood vessels started to leak across her retina (diabetic retinopathy). She had laser treatment to cauterise the vessels, which caused a blurring of vision. Two years ago she was registered as partially sighted. Her sight deteriorated further, but 'I wasn't the type to go blind'. She roars with laughter. 'What on earth do I mean by that? My first experience of reading about blindness was in Beano or Dandy: Blind Bob the grumpy old shepherd, who used to walk around the moors like this.' She gets up and sticks both hands out and staggers across the room. 'Or there's Mr Magoo, who always falls down manholes or walks off the ends of girders; a comedy. I used to call myself Mrs Magoo, when I was partially sighted. \"Oh God, there you go, Mrs Magoo,\" I'd say as I threw the washing-up gloves on to the compost heap instead of the potato peelings. The world changes when you're partially sighted -- but slightly.' </p> <p>As her sight got worse, she went to the leading expert in her particular condition. 'I went privately. Well, I didn't care so much - I took the shilling. It was a place full of mega-rich people. The woman who took me to the lift said to me, \"I was in here with the Queen last week and I felt so ashamed of that carpet\".' She whoops again, lights a fag. </p> <p>Her first haemorrhage blinded her almost completely, over a weekend when she was struggling to write the script for the TV version of The Cappuccino Years. 'I just thought, I can't read or write; I can't do the work. I still didn't think I was the type to go blind. The day I realised I was the type, after all, was when I was in London for a meeting. I already had my retractable white stick but I'd never used it. It was a bright day - very bad for retinopathy; the eye has no filters and the light hits the retina directly - and I was walking towards Leicester Square and the sun came bursting out and I couldn't see a thing. </p> <p>'Well, I could make out I was in a crowd; I could hear roadworks, drilling. And I thought: I'm going to have to get my bloody stick out. Its glorious debut. I took it out and stood there for a while and then I made it to the corner of Dean Street and stumbled into a coffee shop; I realised that it must be because of the noise of chat and the clinking of cups. I went out again, holding on to the wall and my stick. Wanting people to see it and not wanting to. Then I knocked into a metal chair and just sat down in it, on the pavement. A girl with a Croatian accent came up to me and asked me what I wanted and I just said \"cappuccino\", without thinking, and she brought me one. She was very kind. I was trying to count out change, but I couldn't, so I just gave her a fistful of change. And these people with Italian voices told me my bag was wide open by the chair. I was helpless, relying on the kindness of strangers. </p> <p>'Ha! I've become Blanche du Bois. I feel like saying her words: \"Put out the light.\" I hate the sun shining now. I like the twilight hours, when I can make out certain shapes. But I'm never going to see an individual snowdrop again - have you ever looked at one properly? Beautiful. Or see the look in someone's eyes again, or watch how people I love have aged, how life has stamped its story on a face; never going to see my grandchildren grow and change.' </p> <p>For three weeks - after several months of haemorrhages - she has been registered as totally blind. Everyone, she says, tries to imagine blindness - they play that game of closing their eyes and staggering around with their arms outstretched. It is a feeling of lostness, the world disappearing. 'And I've had moments when I've felt quite lost like that, yes.' </p> <p>She points at the squashy red sofa where I'm sitting. 'I went to sleep there, one afternoon - you get very tired; learning to be blind is incredibly hard work. In my sleep I had a haemorrhage in both eyes and when I woke my eyes were full of this black haze, like thick black smoke. I thought there was a fire. I staggered around, trying to put it out. My spatial awareness is crap. It wasn't on the stove, so I thought it was upstairs, and of course I took the black smoke with me, looking for it. It was inside my head. Oh God. So I went to the doctor and said, \"Am I utterly blind now?\" And he said to me, \"Yes, you're quite blind.\" And that was it. All very English. There are no ceremonies for these things.' </p> <p>Most people imagine being blind and dread it. Sight is the sense we most cherish. Sue Townsend is a wonderful writer and a passionate reader. Since she was eight she has read in every spare corner of her day - in bed, on the loo, in the bath, on the bus. And she has written: her Adrian Mole diaries have sold in their millions. She is an observer, with an uncanny eye for detail and nuance. She watches the world, delighted by it. Her favourite hobby and only real recreation is 'mooching around', looking and seeing. </p> <p>She talks of losing her independence - ever since she was tiny, she has loved being able to go off on long bike rides or walks, nobody knowing where she was or when she would return. Now she relies on her family and friends to lead her. She relies on her husband to read to her. 'He is entering my secret life. I've always had a secret life. Oh, nothing shameful - but mine. Reading is private. Being read to, or listening to books on tape, is not. I don't mind so much - it's been quite nice, really.' </p> <p>She talks about the strangeness of never being able to see her own face again. 'It makes me feel as if I've disappeared. As if I'm no longer present - though the cruel irony is with my stick I am highly visible. Of course, any woman who's been behind a pushchair knows what it is like to become invisible; and any woman who's middle-aged. Even the cab drivers stop talking to you when you get to a certain age.' </p> <p>She talks about hating being needy (her expression is sour, as if she is sucking a lemon, at the very word); about hating being patronised: a woman came up to her at a reading in a blindingly sunlit conservatory in Cheltenham and told her she was so very brave and 'my throat closed up with rage and my heart started hammering - I've always had a problem with the misuse of the word \"brave\" - everybody's brave now.' </p> <p>But as she talks and quotes Dorothy Parker ('What fresh hell is this?') she also hoots with laughter, makes jokes, tells stories, demolishes any notion of self-pity, meets disaster and turns it into a triumph. She is, she says, going to turn blindness to her advantage. For instance, she is going to write a piece for this newspaper (a blind, all-seeing observer for The Observer) during the forthcoming election campaign about a terrifyingly poor council estate she visited four years ago and will now revisit, to find out how the people there have done after four years of a New Labour Government. </p> <p>'I wandered and wandered that estate. I didn't talk to anyone in authority. I wanted to see it for myself. The area is so poor they steal the paving stones to sell to people with patios. I wanted to see the pensioner dancing in the barbed-wire-protected town hall. I wanted to see the women wearing sparkly shoes on a Wednesday afternoon. I can't see that now. I can take someone with me to describe it. And I can get them to describe it themselves. It'll be different - like an educated imaginative leap I have to make, based on everything I've seen heard, known.' Because, she goes on, there's always memory. 'Fifty-five years of life to call on. I remember well.' </p> <p>She hasn't cried yet - or not properly, not the snotty, howling, shuddering kind of weeping that goes on and on. 'I haven't had the time. I did start crying in Ikea. Colin has redesigned the kitchen and we went there to choose new doors - not that I could bloody see them, but we went through the motions of me approving them. And there we were, walking along the Market Place aisle, full of the cheaper bits. I couldn't see a thing. I couldn't make out what was a cutting board and what was an orange squeezer. I felt my eyes filling up behind my dark glasses. I cried a bit behind the glasses.' She throws back her head and giggles. 'But then I thought, \"God, I can't cry in Ikea\". It'd be so naff. It is one thing to cry on the moors, striding around blind like Blind Bob the shepherd. Or to cry because I knew I'd never see Capri again. Something poetic. But not in the market place of Ikea.' </p> <p>She laughs about herself, mocks her new status. She had to take off the red shirt she put on to greet me because Colin told her it was filthy. She tells me about the blackheads her eldest daughter hesitantly told her were gathering beneath her eyes ('Oh my Gawd, how long had they been there?'). </p> <p>She hoots with laughter over the designer she heard on Radio 4 (a lifeline and she might end up sending John Humphrys her knickers one day) who designed a range of clothes for the blind. 'I thought, great, a capsule wardrobe, all co-ordinated, things in black and white. But no. It turned out she's got all these clothes that make a noise. Things with bells. Things that rustle when you walk. And they give off a fragrance as well. Very kind thought - but there we are trying to be normal, and we're supposed to go around like a smelly wind chime.' </p> <p>She dreams a lot - vivid dreams of things and faces she thought she had forgotten. And she dreams about Gordon Brown, with whom she identifies because he is blind in one eye. 'He has started to come and visit me, in my dreams. He comes to me for financial advice. He sits on that sofa and I speak in finance speak to him. He listens to me.' </p> <p>But when she wakes up in the morning and opens her eyes and can't see and has to remember all over again that she never will, then she feels lonely. 'It is my lowest point.' But - she brightens, casting her bright, blind gaze at me - 'it is a challenge. I was in a kind of rut, you know, and this is a change. All my life I have loved big changes. I mean, I wouldn't go as far as dashing out my eyes for change - but now they've been dashed out anyway, well, I'm off the treadmill.' </p> <p>Kingsley Amis, she says, used to make her laugh (guiltily) with his hilarious, rude descriptions of blind people. He had this thing about them moving their heads all the time and blinking. I'll be like that soon - blinking and twitching. But let me tell you, I am going to buy the most fantastic dark glasses you've ever seen.' </p> <p><strong>Blindness: the facts</strong></p> <p>\u0095 The most serious diabetic eye condition involves the retina and is called diabetic retinopathy. This condition is very common in people who have had diabetes for a long time. </p> <p>\u0095 There are two types of diabetic retinopathy which can damage sight. Both involve the fine network of blood vessels in the retina. </p> <p>\u0095 The Royal National Institute for the Blind offers advice on the disabling effects of sight loss by providing information and practical services to help people get on with their own lives.

      "body": "<p>Any institution that takes itself too seriously is bound, in the end, to come a cropper at the hands of satirists. It is the only way the world maintains a show of sanity. Few institutions have taken themselves so seriously down the ages as Catholicism, so it has inevitably been mercilessly sent up time after time - particularly in Ireland where, over the past decade, the confessional state has come under sustained attack. Its critics have been many and they have had plenty to go on - from the paedophile scandals that have robbed the priesthood of its natural authority to the growing influence of a socially liberal European Union. </p> <p>But the satirists have played a particular part on the front line of the revolution, fighting alongside acclaimed modern writers like Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn and the more stentorian voices of Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor - who had a penchant for ripping up pictures of the Pope before she succumbed to God and took to wearing a habit - and Shane MacGowan. Of those who choose humour as their weapon, few used it to better effect than Arthur Mathews, co-creator of the Bafta-winning Father Ted, from whose Craggy Island shadow Irish Catholic clerics are still struggling to emerge. </p> <p>Mathews is now giving the decline and fall of the Irish Church another helping hand with Well-Remembered Days, the spoof memoir of E\u00f3in O'Ceallaigh, an 88-year-old old-school Irish Catholic civil servant, confidant of cardinals, and founder of the League of the Mother of God against Sin. </p> <p>O'Ceallaigh - pronounced O'Kelly, in case you think it sounds like a dance - represents the embattled Catholic establishment in Ireland. He is ably assisted by cronies like Father Bunny Long, who lingers over the Thai porn flick 1001 Blow Jobs to make just the right cuts to satisfy public decency, Jimmy 'Kiss of Life' Traynor, a Department of Welfare official who is so fearful of euthanasia that he patrols hospitals giving unsuspecting patients the kiss of life and Father Tom Winlick, whose ministry to alcoholics consists of shouting 'stop drinking' at them. </p> <p>Despite such a cast list of grotesques, Mathews, an affable giant in his early forties with a look of John Hegley and a body as seemingly elastic as Woody's in Toy Story, insists that he has 'no dislike of priests at all'. Instead, he says it is the unrivalled power that Catholicism wielded in the Ireland of his childhood and adolescence that makes it such an alluring target. 'Catholicism and nationalism were the only two things that mattered in Ireland when I was growing up. To be Irish was to be pious and Catholic.' </p> <p>It is only in so far as they exercised this power that priests and bishops, long a similarly attractive source for other Irish comics like Dave Allen, attract Mathews's fire. </p> <p>'On the one hand they are meant to be this extraordinary thing, God's representatives on earth, all very spiritual, but at the same time they are human beings dealing in their parishes with the most mundane of problems. The two things just clash in a surreal way.' </p> <p>That was the basic joke in Father Ted, but one which Mathews and his co-writer Graham Linehan, plus their all-Irish cast, had to bring to Britain to get broadcast. And when it first came out in 1994, the series did not go down too well in those parts of Ireland that could pick up Channel 4. If the ensuing fuss ever caused him sleepless nights, Mathews is not admitting it now. </p> <p>With an infectiously happy, wheezy laugh he delights in the irony that something so totally Irish as Father Ted ended up being exported to Ireland when state broadcaster RTE finally and belatedly agreed to air it. It is, for him, a potent symbol of the absurdity of the old Catholic Ireland. </p> <p>Yet he is wary of those who try to accord Father Ted too great a role in turning the new generation in Ireland against its clerics. The Church was doing fine on its own. But the series was, he admits, part of some sea change that was already underway. ' Father Ted was silly rather than satirical. It did play up to clich\u00e9s, but it was basically berserk. You can't scrutinise it in any serious, political way.' </p> <p>It was blessed with good timing, riding and, for some, symbolising the new wave of disillusionment with the Church. Two of its stars - the late Dermot Morgan (Ted) and Frank Kelly (Father Jack) - had been working away for many years sending up Catholicism to small but appreciative audiences without ever seeing either their careers take off or the cathedrals start to crumble. With Father Ted they became household names. If the Inquisition were still around, the whole Father Ted crew would probably be on its books. Mathews himself is on the cusp of the two generations in Ireland - between an older one, caricatured in E\u00f3in O'Ceallaigh, and those in their twenties who now say that the Church is largely of no more than historical interest. </p> <p>For Mathews it was more real and destructive. A product of rural Ireland, educated at a Vincentian boarding school in Dublin, his student days were the period of the Catholic rearguard action to stop the legalisation of divorce and contraception. For him, as for many others, the fight proved a decisive moment. He had to take sides. </p> <p>'I still call myself an ethnic Catholic and if I'm in trouble my first thought is to pray, but after a lot of deep thought I decided that conflict between the rational and the illogical was too much, so I had to stop believing.' </p> <p>That decision has not stopped him taking Catholicism as the dominant theme in his work to date. There is in him something of the ex-nun who carries on writing about religion even when she has skipped over the wall of the convent. Though Mathews shows few signs of real bitterness at the Church, he sheds few tears about its decline. </p> <p>'If people can get some sort of solace out of Catholicism, then great, but religion seems to me to be a relic that came out of people's lives being utterly miserable.' </p> <p>And that decline, he argues, is far from complete. Twenty-year-olds in Dublin may adopt the the same attitudes as their European cousins to divorce and contraception, but abortion remains outlawed and RTE still broadcasts the Angelus bell each day at 6pm, albeit with a pastoral picture as the backdrop rather than an icon of the Holy Family. (He might also add that RTE has refused to go beyond the pilot of his new project - a spoof Irish radio phone-in, which he has now taken to BBC Radio 4.) </p> <p>Other Irish, or second-generation Irish comics, with a similar upbringing to Mathews, dabbled in their early days with Catholicism as a subject. And it does have much to recommend it - from its decidedly surreal penchant for accessories like moving statues, weeping Madonnas and singing nuns through to a vocabulary which describes the most earthy of acts, sex, by the most unworldly of words, genital expression. </p> <p>Caroline Aherne captured this to a tee when she used to do a turn as the bespectacled, repressive Irish nun, Sister Mary Immaculate. Brenda Gilhooley (who now plays Gayle Tuesday) was another who included the Church among her targets in her stand-up routine. Both have now moved on, but both, though Catholic with roots in Ireland, were wholly British-based. Certainly, they could be dismissed by the Catholic establishment in Ireland as pandering to the anti-Irish prejudices of their near neighbours. The same was said too of Mary O'Malley after her 1977 play Once a Catholic became a big success. Though having links to Ireland, she came from Middlesex. </p> <p>Mathews, though, moves between Dublin and London and of the two considers Dublin his home. He is hard to avoid. And he has stuck to his task. O'Ceallaigh, after all, has been around since July 1991 when he first surfaced in a newsletter called Majority Ethos, which Mathews produced and distributed to the piety stalls at the back of Dublin churches. Its banner proclaimed 'marriage, not sex - jobs, not condoms - faith, not sodomy'. It purported to be the mouthpiece of a traditionalist Catholic organisation. Those who wrote back clearly missed the joke. </p> <p>He laughs at the memory. 'Their irony antennae weren't up,' he says. But they had had precious little practice. Many of their previous debunkers - like the writer Edna O'Brien, or campaigning journalists like Nell McCafferty - majored on anger and the human cost of the Church's rule book. </p> <p>The antennae are up now. The book has already been given a rapturous welcome by the Irish critics who are hailing Mathews as a throwback to Flann O'Brien who was at the height of his powers in the 1950s. The comparison is apt for, like Mathews, O'Brien used ridicule and anarchy. </p> <p>Another comparison that is sometimes made about Mathews's work in Father Ted is with 1960s British television series such as All Gas and Gaiters. This Derek Nimmo vehicle worked in a similarly surreal way. It relied on the fact that, though the Church of England was increasingly out of step at the time with a swinging modern world, it still had some clout, as did Irish Catholicism when Father Ted first appeared. To work the comedy needed something to kick against. (Today's Anglican equivalent, The Vicar of Dibley, is less a send-up of the Church of England than a picture of the misfits to be found in any English village.) </p> <p>Yet by his successes does Mathews now run the risk of doing himself out of a job? Already Irish commentators like Mary Kenny have registered a new mood in her homeland that the Church has been over-trounced and should be left to get on with its twilight years in peace. Other stars of Father Ted, such as Pauline McFlynn and Ardal O'Hanlon, are, in her opinion, publicly sidestepping invitations to ridicule Catholicism. </p> <p>And Mathews too has begun to adapt. In Well-Remembered Days, there is a side-swipe at the Angela's Ashes industry. </p> <p>After recalling his rural childhood as one of a multitude with a mother who acted as wet nurse to half the village, including a schoolteacher who paid her a shilling a suck, O'Ceallaigh directly addresses Frank McCourt. </p> <p>'I remember people smiled more, but of course McCourt uses this fact to portray the Irish as gormless imbeciles... No, Frank, they were smiling because they were HAPPY, an emotion I'm sure you are unfamiliar with, despite the fact that you have over a million pounds.' </p> <p>For some critics, this broadening of horizons is not enough. Reviewing the book enthusiastically in the Irish Times (where Mathews also writes a cod television column, again as an old-style Catholic hardliner), Terry Eagleton, professor of English and author of The Truth about the Irish, ended by suggesting that if Ireland were really a truly modern European nation, it would be able 'to recall its history without either tearful sentimentalism or glib derision.

It was in the Sixties that he came into his own, and Couples (1968) was the supreme Zeitgeist bestseller of the decade; Portnoy's Complaint may have dragged masturbation into the spotlight, but Couples created the literature of oral sex. By then, he'd already written four novels, one of which, Rabbit, Run (1960), became the foundation-instalment for his most extensive survey of his times. </p> <p>The fact of having led Harry 'Rabbit' Angstrom to the grave in Rabbit at Rest (1990) seems not to have killed his 10-yearly itch to revisit those chronicles. His new book of stories, Licks of Love, ends with 'Rabbit Remembered', a further bulletin almost 200 pages long which takes Angstrom's children into the new millennium. The richly productive Updike is one of the few writers you can genuinely imagine taking pride in giving value for money. If these stories 'were written in much the order they have here', as a brisk sentence added to the acknowledgements indicates, then Updike has been weighing the joys and traumas of the Sixties, with his verdict gradually becoming less indulgent. </p> <p>In the first story, the tone is one of wry nostalgia: 'The Sixties had taught us the high moral value of copulation, and we were slow to give up on an activity so simultaneously pleasurable and healthy... we hadn't learned yet to take the emotion out of sex.' The paradoxical result of all this coupling is that the narrator ends up more obsessed with his few failures to connect ('The Women Who Got Away', as the story's title has it) than his many successes. This feeling of being cheated is likely to be shared by couples who refused to break up. Second marriages, though, seem to contain an element of stiffness, 'a certain considerate wariness', which seems a poor substitute. </p> <p>Later narrators are more sceptical about the usefulness of 'looking outside the home for strength to keep the home going'. One likens infidelity to a mind-expanding drug with disastrous side-effects - 'It destroys cells' - and by the end of the book the decade that licensed the drug is described by Rabbit's son, Nelson, as a 'sexual mess.' </p> <p>Updike has not ignored feminism, and is quite capable of writing thrilling pages from a woman's point of view, and right-on sentences like: 'Nobody wants war but men don't want only peace either.' In his descriptions of dealings between the sexes, though, there is a persistently ugly residue which is not necessarily untruthful. 'You fuck at first to stake a claim, and afterwards to keep the claim staked,' is the conclusion of Updike's other recurring character, the Jewish novelist Henry Bech, in 'His Oeuvre', but he isn't alone in his attitude. A number of sentences seem almost specifically written to corroborate L\u00e9vi-Strauss's idea that women are a medium of exchange between men, with an essentially symbolic function: 'The men she had slept with were each still in her, a kind of investment...' </p> <p>News of a woman's death calls up something more primal than regret, if she is a past partner: 'He is trying to joke away that trance men get into trying to remember what it was like entering a certain woman's space. Now that space is nowhere on earth and he will never get back into it.' Even alive, a woman can represent death, by withholding her body: 'I felt in her presence the fear of death a man feels with a woman who once opened herself to him and is available no more.' Is it possible that Updike hasn't noticed the decline in female prestige across this sentence, from the heights of opening herself to the humbling status of commodity no longer available? </p> <p>One narrator is cut from a coarser cloth than the others, and that's Eddie Chester, the Virginia banjo-player on a goodwill tour of the USSR in 'Licks of Love in the Heart of the Cold War'. Updike signals his distance from the character with plentiful clich\u00e9 ('my happy home'; 'his lovely wife') and a sex scene full of queasy euphemism ('I carried the courtesies down below'). But he can't long withhold his own richness of perception from his creatures: 'By the time the reception was breaking up, the whole scene might have been a picture printed on silk, waving gently in and out.' Not bad for a banjo-picker. </p> <p>Updike's parish of sympathies is unusually wide, but it must remain that, a parish. The chronicle aspect of the Rabbit saga requires much dutiful fullness, which early in 'Rabbit Remembered' threatens to silt up the narrative flow with historical details about the dry-cleaning industry. But some aspects of modern life are incorporated without flair, notably the homosexuality of one of Rabbit's extended family, Georgie, an unsuccessful dancer based in New York. </p> <p>In one of the stories, Updike tackles the subject more structurally, having his narrator end up with another man, but it feels more like a fictional permutation yet to be tried than a fully imagined experience. The male couple is presented as a fact of life, entirely without sensuousness, though if he has done nothing else in his work Updike has celebrated the fact of sensuousness. </p> <p>Though he has pursued the question 'What might my life be like if I wasn't a writer?' across the many hundred pages of the Rabbit books, and no less doggedly wondered what it might mean not to be a Gentile in the Bech stories, he flinches from launching into an exploration of what it might be like not to be heterosexual. It may be that he simply doesn't feel covetous of gay culture, in the way that he has seemed driven to co-opt Jewish vitality. Or it may be that he can't begin to imagine a life not polarised by the love and resentment of women. Either way, he finds this third chasm the hardest to jump.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Licks of Love John Updike Hamish Hamilton \u00a316.99, pp359 Buy it at a discount at BOL John Updike has been precocious and prodigious for 40 years. It was in the Sixties that he came into his own, and Couples (1968) was the supreme Zeitgeist bestseller of the decade; Portnoy's Complaint may have dragged masturbation into the spotlight, but Couples created the literature of oral sex. By then, he'd already written four novels, one of which, Rabbit, Run (1960), became the foundation-instalment for his most extensive survey of his times. The fact of having led Harry 'Rabbit' Angstrom to the grave in Rabbit at Rest (1990) seems not to have killed his 10-yearly itch to revisit those chronicles. His new book of stories, Licks of Love, ends with 'Rabbit Remembered', a further bulletin almost 200 pages long which takes Angstrom's children into the new millennium. The richly productive Updike is one of the few writers you can genuinely imagine taking pride in giving value for money. If these stories 'were written in much the order they have here', as a brisk sentence added to the acknowledgements indicates, then Updike has been weighing the joys and traumas of the Sixties, with his verdict gradually becoming less indulgent. In the first story, the tone is one of wry nostalgia: 'The Sixties had taught us the high moral value of copulation, and we were slow to give up on an activity so simultaneously pleasurable and healthy... we hadn't learned yet to take the emotion out of sex.' The paradoxical result of all this coupling is that the narrator ends up more obsessed with his few failures to connect ('The Women Who Got Away', as the story's title has it) than his many successes. This feeling of being cheated is likely to be shared by couples who refused to break up. Second marriages, though, seem to contain an element of stiffness, 'a certain considerate wariness', which seems a poor substitute. Later narrators are more sceptical about the usefulness of 'looking outside the home for strength to keep the home going'. One likens infidelity to a mind-expanding drug with disastrous side-effects - 'It destroys cells' - and by the end of the book the decade that licensed the drug is described by Rabbit's son, Nelson, as a 'sexual mess.' Updike has not ignored feminism, and is quite capable of writing thrilling pages from a woman's point of view, and right-on sentences like: 'Nobody wants war but men don't want only peace either.' In his descriptions of dealings between the sexes, though, there is a persistently ugly residue which is not necessarily untruthful. 'You fuck at first to stake a claim, and afterwards to keep the claim staked,' is the conclusion of Updike's other recurring character, the Jewish novelist Henry Bech, in 'His Oeuvre', but he isn't alone in his attitude. A number of sentences seem almost specifically written to corroborate L\u00e9vi-Strauss's idea that women are a medium of exchange between men, with an essentially symbolic function: 'The men she had slept with were each still in her, a kind of investment...' News of a woman's death calls up something more primal than regret, if she is a past partner: 'He is trying to joke away that trance men get into trying to remember what it was like entering a certain woman's space. Now that space is nowhere on earth and he will never get back into it.' Even alive, a woman can represent death, by withholding her body: 'I felt in her presence the fear of death a man feels with a woman who once opened herself to him and is available no more.' Is it possible that Updike hasn't noticed the decline in female prestige across this sentence, from the heights of opening herself to the humbling status of commodity no longer available? One narrator is cut from a coarser cloth than the others, and that's Eddie Chester, the Virginia banjo-player on a goodwill tour of the USSR in 'Licks of Love in the Heart of the Cold War'. Updike signals his distance from the character with plentiful clich\u00e9 ('my happy home'; 'his lovely wife') and a sex scene full of queasy euphemism ('I carried the courtesies down below'). But he can't long withhold his own richness of perception from his creatures: 'By the time the reception was breaking up, the whole scene might have been a picture printed on silk, waving gently in and out.' Not bad for a banjo-picker. Updike's parish of sympathies is unusually wide, but it must remain that, a parish. The chronicle aspect of the Rabbit saga requires much dutiful fullness, which early in 'Rabbit Remembered' threatens to silt up the narrative flow with historical details about the dry-cleaning industry. But some aspects of modern life are incorporated without flair, notably the homosexuality of one of Rabbit's extended family, Georgie, an unsuccessful dancer based in New York. In one of the stories, Updike tackles the subject more structurally, having his narrator end up with another man, but it feels more like a fictional permutation yet to be tried than a fully imagined experience. The male couple is presented as a fact of life, entirely without sensuousness, though if he has done nothing else in his work Updike has celebrated the fact of sensuousness. Though he has pursued the question 'What might my life be like if I wasn't a writer?' across the many hundred pages of the Rabbit books, and no less doggedly wondered what it might mean not to be a Gentile in the Bech stories, he flinches from launching into an exploration of what it might be like not to be heterosexual. It may be that he simply doesn't feel covetous of gay culture, in the way that he has seemed driven to co-opt Jewish vitality. Or it may be that he can't begin to imagine a life not polarised by the love and resentment of women. Either way, he finds this third chasm the hardest to jump.",

Superficially, there are obvious similarities; both went to Oxford, were deeply influenced by their fathers, spoilt their wayward sons and were skilled at manipulating populist sentiments. And, of course, they were implacable women, playing hard in a male-dominated world, leaders who grew hubristic and ruthless. Together with Benazir Bhutto, Thatcher and Gandhi have also joined the gallery of female demons who are invoked every time feminists need to be put in their place. </p> <p>When they met in September 1976, according to Hugo Young, Thatcher's biographer, they bonded immediately and developed a 'uniquely easy relationship'. But the similitude can be exaggerated. One was the ambitious daughter of a small grocer who skilfully gained entry into the corridors of power in a secure and stable country; the other was born at a historic moment and had power and politics thrust upon her from the moment of her birth into a rich and influential family which lived in a grand manor house with Serves porcelain, crystal, grand pianos and libraries, Savile Row suits and expensive whisky. The boys were educated at Harrow and Oxbridge and girls had English governesses who gave the children English names. Indira's father, Jawaharlal, became 'Joe' and his sisters were renamed 'Nan' and 'Betty'. </p> <p>This is the kind of exquisite detail we get from this well-researched book by Katherine Frank, an American biographer who lives in Britain. Astonishingly, this is the first definitive and objective biography of an exceptional woman who had deep flaws and, in the end, a tragic life whichever way you choose to examine it. The writing style is unexciting and, at times, even boring, but the material more than makes up for this. It may even be an advantage. Too many insufferably egotistic biographers allow their own flourishes to dominate the text and the subject ends up as a bit player. This story is rich and exhaustingly dramatic from start to finish; the protagonists are both making the destiny of the nation and negotiating their own lives in a wildly unpredictable political and social landscape. In fact, the domestic lives of the Nehru family read like episodes from Dallas, only more quarrelsome and cruel. </p> <p>Indira was a loved grandchild and daughter but was totally controlled and directed. When she was nine, her grandfather tried to ban physical contact between her and her beloved mother. Like Rousseau's Emile, she was expected to be physically resilient. Jawaharlal insisted that she had to run long distances every day and with grace, 'breathing through her heels'. He told her what to wear, to read, to think and she obeyed until much later on in life, when there were one or two mild rebellions. Eventually, she became the largely disappointed wife of an attractive but philandering man, Feroze Gandhi. These were the men who made the woman so many grew to hate in time. None of this excuses the inhumane policies such as the forced sterilisation programmes of 1976 or the betrayal of democratic principles which Indira is now infamous for (the worst of these was the suspension of the constitution in 1975) but it does perhaps help to understand why she was so often driven and unyielding. </p> <p>Until now, Jawaharlal Nehru seems to have got away with rather a benign historical reputation. He married a young and (at the time) insecure woman, Kamala, and then allowed his domineering sisters, particularly Nan, to maltreat her for the rest of her life, even when she was seriously ill several times with TB or pleurisy. Indira loved her mother intensely and worried whenever she was left alone with her in-laws, especially when Nehru was in and out of prison in the Thirties taking on the British as the independence movement grew. She wrote to him in 1934: 'Do you know anything about what happens to Mummy when you are absent? Do you know that when she was in agony, there was no one to help her?' He displayed that all-too-familiar behaviour of Asian men who leave their wives at the mercy of their families, some of whom think that it is their duty to treat the daughter-in-law with disregard and calculated unkindness. </p> <p>Indira was already uncomfortable in her skin when she heard Nan say that she was 'ugly and stupid'. The teenager was devastated and 50 years later confessed that the woman had 'blighted my youth'. She remained convinced that she was unattractive until she met Feroze Gandhi (not related to the mahatma, although many make that assumption) who so lifted her spirits (at that time) that she began to blossom. Her beauty was defrosted and came out from below the surface; you can see this in some of the photographs in the book. Perhaps this is why she could never quite let go of Feroze and forgave him repeatedly. They were on the point of another reconciliation in 1960 when he died of a heart attack, still only 48. </p> <p>Sex, too, was a big player in this saga of the Nehru and Gandhi families. Kamala developed into an irresistibly attractive woman in her thirties. Young men became her acolytes as she developed her own passions and policies, all concerned with the rights of women and girls in India. Feroze was a devotee and many reliable people believe they had a long and satisfying affair. After she died, Nehru had affairs too and then fell in love with Edwina Mountbatten. In time, Indira was rumoured to have taken on a lover too. </p> <p>The larger political picture is just as riveting. The long struggle for freedom, the assassination of the mahatma, partition and independence with her father leading the country, all affected and involved Indira profoundly. Her own shaky start (never intended - her father did not want a political dynasty for India) is well recorded as is the way she transformed the political culture of her country, moving it towards what the historian Sunil Khilnani describes as the Jacobin idea of popular sovereignty, with the poor increasingly committed to the idea of democracy and the vote. The role of the impetuous Sanjay in her eventual unpopularity is also clearly described, as are the staggering mistakes in Punjab and Kashmir. There is much more in this long and excellent book. </p> <p>My only gripe would be that the author becomes so awed by her subject that she makes the same mistake Indira made in coming to believe that she was India, or even Mother India. Nobody is that big or important, not in such a large, multifarious country and this is a lesson all leaders have had to learn, sometimes by dying brutally, as in the case of Indira.</p>",

Do you appear to be bonding? If not, she may register her concern in your notes. If her concern makes you fear the worst, it's nothing next to the host of anxieties that other health professionals will encourage in the weeks and months to come. If you're not worrying about babynappers, you're losing sleep because of that pamphlet on cot death. If you're not worrying about 'snapping', like those baby-battering parents in the NSPCC posters, you're worrying about the paedophiles who, the tabloids assure us, are lurking on every street. If, in spite of all this, you learn to relax and enjoy your child, it will probably be because you've built up your own network of helpful and reassuring friends and left the childcare gods to fight among themselves. </p> <p>That's what I think, anyway. Frank Furedi thinks so, too - even though he does not actually get around to saying it until the very last pages of his alarmist book on modern parenthood. Most of us, he believes, never do recover from those early upsets. Deranged by all the scare stories and finger-wagging professionals, we believe the world is a very dangerous place for children. Convinced that we must keep our children under constant surveillance, we do not give them enough room to grow. Fearful that we might be seen as child abusers, we are reluctant to engage with the ever-dwindling pool of children who are out and about without supervising adults. So, when our own children ask to go outside alone, we know we cannot depend on other adults to advise or protect them. They are on their own to a degree previous generations would have thought unimaginable. And so are we. </p> <p>Furedi calls this sad state of affairs the 'breakdown of adult solidarity'. He goes on to point out that is not a problem in all societies, even in Western Europe. In Germany, for example, adults still do take collective responsibility for children playing outside on their own, and children enjoy far greater independence much earlier than most British children. It would have been interesting to know why. Is their media more responsible in reporting scandals involving baby-batterers and baby snatchers? Do they refuse to bow to childcare gurus? Or is it that the government encourages mothers of young children to stay at home, thereby preserving the old neighbour hood networks eroded in countries where women return early to full-time work? Furedi is a sociologist, and therefore perfectly positioned to explore these questions in an even-handed way. </p> <p>If he does not do so here, it could be because he's in the grip of the very thing he wrote the book to challenge. One word that springs to mind is paranoid, but perhaps melodramatic would be more accurate. He likes to see himself as an intellectual David, conspired against on all sides by professional Goliaths. In fact, many people working in the 'parenting field' are just as concerned as he is about the issues he raises, and it is thanks to their research that Furedi can marshal so much evidence to support his claims. </p> <p>He is not above misrepresenting them. He does a lot of hemming and hawing, for example, about the Mental Health Foundation's recent claim that childhood mental health problems are increasing. He suggests, perhaps correctly, that this is based on research designed to justify a bid for better funding. What he does not bother to mention is that the same MHF document suggests that children might be suffering more today because they have so little opportunity for exploration and independent play. This is Furedi's line exactly, as is the MHF plea that we stop thinking of children as victims and start paying more attention to their capacity for resilience. Why is he so keen to obscure the common ground? And why does he work so hard to alienate ordinary parents?</p> <p>In his closing remarks, he urges us to push the expert culture to one side and trust our own eyes and ears and judgments. Instead of depending on an army of professionals, we should build our own informal networks of relatives and friends. Most importantly, we should relax. After 22 anxious years on the job, I know I still need to hear this. When I look around me, I see many younger parents who need to hear it even more than I do. But how many of them are going to pick up a book that promises to add to their troubles by labelling them paranoid? </p> <p>As a rule, parents buy books that promise to help them. Furedi goes to great lengths to show how empty that promise is in most cases. In fact, there is only one childcare book he can stand, and that is Perfect Families, Christina Hardyment's excellent survey of 200 years of wrong-headed and ideologically suspect childcare expertise. By a strange coincidence, Hardyment also seems to have inspired Rebecca Abrams's almost perfect book about second children.</p> <p>There are no empty promises here, and even Furedi would be hard pressed to find 'prejudice masquerading as expert knowledge'. Abrams talks to her readers as equals and would not dream of telling them what to think or how to live. Her aim is to give them all the information she would have liked to have had at her fingertips when she had her second child. She talks about how different it is to be pregnant when you are also looking after another young child. Having charted the physical changes, she looks at the emotional changes that mothers can go through and how relationships with the first-born can alter. </p> <p>Abrams goes on to consider sibling rivalry and the strains that can occur in the relationship between the parents. Last not but least, she looks at the question of work, pointing out that new research shows how it is after the second rather than the first child that mothers are more likely to leave the full-time workforce, at least in the short term. She mingles her personal experiences with accounts by many other parents, so that the wide variety of possibilities is always given. Never does she imply that there is only one way. All she does is give them the context and the facts, so that the new experience doesn't throw them and they can enjoy their children and relax. If Furedi and his wife ever decide to go for a second child, they'd be crazy not to read this book.</p>",

Do you appear to be bonding? If not, she may register her concern in your notes. If her concern makes you fear the worst, it's nothing next to the host of anxieties that other health professionals will encourage in the weeks and months to come. If you're not worrying about babynappers, you're losing sleep because of that pamphlet on cot death. If you're not worrying about 'snapping', like those baby-battering parents in the NSPCC posters, you're worrying about the paedophiles who, the tabloids assure us, are lurking on every street. If, in spite of all this, you learn to relax and enjoy your child, it will probably be because you've built up your own network of helpful and reassuring friends and left the childcare gods to fight among themselves. That's what I think, anyway. Frank Furedi thinks so, too - even though he does not actually get around to saying it until the very last pages of his alarmist book on modern parenthood. Most of us, he believes, never do recover from those early upsets. Deranged by all the scare stories and finger-wagging professionals, we believe the world is a very dangerous place for children. Convinced that we must keep our children under constant surveillance, we do not give them enough room to grow. Fearful that we might be seen as child abusers, we are reluctant to engage with the ever-dwindling pool of children who are out and about without supervising adults. So, when our own children ask to go outside alone, we know we cannot depend on other adults to advise or protect them. They are on their own to a degree previous generations would have thought unimaginable. And so are we. Furedi calls this sad state of affairs the 'breakdown of adult solidarity'. He goes on to point out that is not a problem in all societies, even in Western Europe. In Germany, for example, adults still do take collective responsibility for children playing outside on their own, and children enjoy far greater independence much earlier than most British children. It would have been interesting to know why. Is their media more responsible in reporting scandals involving baby-batterers and baby snatchers? Do they refuse to bow to childcare gurus? Or is it that the government encourages mothers of young children to stay at home, thereby preserving the old neighbour hood networks eroded in countries where women return early to full-time work? Furedi is a sociologist, and therefore perfectly positioned to explore these questions in an even-handed way. If he does not do so here, it could be because he's in the grip of the very thing he wrote the book to challenge. One word that springs to mind is paranoid, but perhaps melodramatic would be more accurate. He likes to see himself as an intellectual David, conspired against on all sides by professional Goliaths. In fact, many people working in the 'parenting field' are just as concerned as he is about the issues he raises, and it is thanks to their research that Furedi can marshal so much evidence to support his claims. He is not above misrepresenting them. He does a lot of hemming and hawing, for example, about the Mental Health Foundation's recent claim that childhood mental health problems are increasing. He suggests, perhaps correctly, that this is based on research designed to justify a bid for better funding. What he does not bother to mention is that the same MHF document suggests that children might be suffering more today because they have so little opportunity for exploration and independent play. This is Furedi's line exactly, as is the MHF plea that we stop thinking of children as victims and start paying more attention to their capacity for resilience. Why is he so keen to obscure the common ground? And why does he work so hard to alienate ordinary parents? In his closing remarks, he urges us to push the expert culture to one side and trust our own eyes and ears and judgments. Instead of depending on an army of professionals, we should build our own informal networks of relatives and friends. Most importantly, we should relax. After 22 anxious years on the job, I know I still need to hear this. When I look around me, I see many younger parents who need to hear it even more than I do. But how many of them are going to pick up a book that promises to add to their troubles by labelling them paranoid? As a rule, parents buy books that promise to help them. Furedi goes to great lengths to show how empty that promise is in most cases. In fact, there is only one childcare book he can stand, and that is Perfect Families, Christina Hardyment's excellent survey of 200 years of wrong-headed and ideologically suspect childcare expertise. By a strange coincidence, Hardyment also seems to have inspired Rebecca Abrams's almost perfect book about second children. There are no empty promises here, and even Furedi would be hard pressed to find 'prejudice masquerading as expert knowledge'. Abrams talks to her readers as equals and would not dream of telling them what to think or how to live. Her aim is to give them all the information she would have liked to have had at her fingertips when she had her second child. She talks about how different it is to be pregnant when you are also looking after another young child. Having charted the physical changes, she looks at the emotional changes that mothers can go through and how relationships with the first-born can alter. Abrams goes on to consider sibling rivalry and the strains that can occur in the relationship between the parents. Last not but least, she looks at the question of work, pointing out that new research shows how it is after the second rather than the first child that mothers are more likely to leave the full-time workforce, at least in the short term. She mingles her personal experiences with accounts by many other parents, so that the wide variety of possibilities is always given. Never does she imply that there is only one way. All she does is give them the context and the facts, so that the new experience doesn't throw them and they can enjoy their children and relax. If Furedi and his wife ever decide to go for a second child, they'd be crazy not to read this book.",

There is also a risk that this might just be an excuse to end a relationship.' Viewers of BBC1's Castaway last year saw this played out when Tricia Prater left her husband, Juan, for a year to 'find herself' on the remote Scottish island of Taransay with 25 strangers. 'You put an attractive woman like Tricia on an island for a year, and sooner or later some stud will be after her,' Juan opined to TV cameras before his wife's departure. The 'stud' turned out to be Trevor from Liverpool, another castaway. 'It's important people don't confuse sabbaticals of this sort with a trial separation,' cautioned Julia Coles of Relate, the relationship advisory service. 'It sounds a great kind of thing to do if you have a good healthy relationship without any buried problems. But if you do have problems, when you come back they'll still be there.' ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk",

In Bee Season, the girl is Ellie - Eliza Naumann - and there is a success story at the start. Eleven-year-old Ellie, lacklustre and overlooked at home and at her school in a small city in the American South, surprises herself by winning the class spelling bee, then the school-wide one, then goes on to the state and national finals.</p> <p>At first it seems as if the other Naumanns are all a success story - the mother a lawyer with uncanny powers of concentration, the father an outstanding scholar who gave it up for drugs and sex in the Sixties but is still on the track of revelation (through Jewish mystical studies), happily employed as a folkie leader of sung prayer at the local synogogue; and Aaron, a straight-A student who practices guitar with Dad every afternoon.

The father's appearance of paternal caring is at best narcissism disguised. You read this book as a partisan. In the way of the bestseller it was in the States, it is almost too involving - but you're too involved to care. As it turns out, all the family members are on extreme if not crazy quests for God and perfection. Ellie, ironically, is the one who seems to achieve something like revelation, but, in a Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner reversal, recognises it as a form of madness.</p> <p>If there is anything in common among the girls in these novels, it is the threat of madness. In Mary George, it mostly comes from outside, in the obsession the town psychotic, Tom Hepple, has with her as his potential saviour. Mary is the 17-year-old daughter of separated parents, who lives with and is embarrassed by a mother in ankle bells and big kaftans, though Mary's style also runs to the bohemian. She wears ill-fitting charity shop costumes. Her father is an architect who used to work out of a disused chapel in their village of Allnorthover. When Tom, whose mother helped bring up Mary's father, returns after years in mental hospitals, secrets begin to emerge about the break-up of Mary's parents and how it was related to Mr George's possibly too-warm feelings for Tom's mother.</p> <p>Mary, meanwhile, in her last year in the local school, is floundering to find where she belongs - with her friend Billy, a pot-smoking, motorcycling, long-haired village boy; with her old friend Julie, working as a waitress in a tarty uniform; with the flamboyant, artistic family of the new doctor in town; or with the foppish art student who seems to take Mary up only to lay her aside; does she belong to the country or London, to her mother or her father or crazy Tom, or anywhere?</p> <p>This novel is as much about England and village life as about Mary, who in many ways is a generic teenager of the artistic, sensitive type.

      "body": "<p>Sixty years after a British RAF pilot was shot down in a World War II dogfight, his remains have been found in the wreckage of his plane at a French seaside village.</p> <p>Workers discovered Flight Lieutenant Bruce Arthur Rogers's remains on Monday while digging a trench for a gas main in Ambleteuse, a village between Boulogne and Calais on the Channel coast.</p> <p>His plane - probably a Hurricane - was one of a convoy of fighters from the Royal Air Force's 242 Squadron. The convoy set off from RAF Coltishall near Norwich on 17 June 1941 to escort bombers on a raid to destroy a chemical factory at the nearby French town of Bethune.</p> <p>Rogers was 23 at the time and hailed from Eskdale in Cumbria. An Oxford graduate, he was married and his wife Dora was said to be expecting their first child.</p> <p>Bernard Duperier, a French fighter pilot who operated out of British airfields in 1941, recalled that the escort operation which Rogers was involved in was a new tactic tried out for the first time in the Bethune raid. He also recalled in his memoirs that Rogers was shot down in a dogfight with a German pilot.</p> <p>'During a series of engagements with enemy planes, 242 squadron lost three pilots of whom my flight commander, Rogers, was one.</p> <p>'Rogers was a very fine chap and an extremely good pilot. He had many good qualities that were appreciated by everyone,' he wrote.</p> <p>'The week before I had dined with him at his home. After his death, despite myself, I thought of his young wife who was expecting a baby in a few months.'</p> <p>One elderly Ambleteuse woman who declined to give her name said she had witnessed a German and a British plane dogfighting when she was a girl, walking with her father.</p> <p>'I was here,' she said, standing on the wind-lashed beach, 'and saw them chasing each other in the skies above the port of Boulogne. You could see the English coast in the distance.</p> <p>'The British plane was hit and it plummeted to the ground over there. I couldn't see where it crashed but I could see a plume of black smoke. The other plane flew off over the countryside.'</p> <p>The witness said she was certain it was Rogers's plane she had seen shot down because several days later her daughter was injured during bombardments in Rue Thiers in Ambleteuse. 'I can date it so precisely because I know when my daughter was hurt.'</p> <p>Another Ambleteuse resident, Ren\u00e9 Feutry, recalled that his father, Alexandre, was a voluntary fireman and was on duty on the day of the crash. 'I was just a baby at the time,' he said. 'But my father often spoke of the crash later. He said an English plane was shot down by a German fighter which had been in pursuit.</p> <p>'My father and his colleagues rushed to put out the blaze that followed the crash. But German soldiers intervened and ordered them to do nothing.' It is not clear whether Rogers died in the crash or whether he burned to death in the wreckage.</p> <p>'At the time, the German soldiers would let the pilots burn in their wreckage without helping them or allowing them to be helped,' said another Ambleteuse resident. 'People here even saw, in other crashes at Ambleteuse, some British pilots would be stoned if they were still alive.'</p> <p>According to the local paper, La Voix du Nord , Rogers's identity tag and 'a few fragments of his charred body' were buried by Nazi soldiers in a communal grave at the cemetery near the village. The rest of his body was covered over in the wreckage until last week.</p> <p>Rogers's 242 squadron was founded in World War I with mostly Canadian pilots.</p> <p>Dissolved in 1919, it was re-founded in 1939 under the motto 'Always Ready'.

      "bodyText": "Sixty years after a British RAF pilot was shot down in a World War II dogfight, his remains have been found in the wreckage of his plane at a French seaside village. Workers discovered Flight Lieutenant Bruce Arthur Rogers's remains on Monday while digging a trench for a gas main in Ambleteuse, a village between Boulogne and Calais on the Channel coast. His plane - probably a Hurricane - was one of a convoy of fighters from the Royal Air Force's 242 Squadron. The convoy set off from RAF Coltishall near Norwich on 17 June 1941 to escort bombers on a raid to destroy a chemical factory at the nearby French town of Bethune. Rogers was 23 at the time and hailed from Eskdale in Cumbria. An Oxford graduate, he was married and his wife Dora was said to be expecting their first child. Bernard Duperier, a French fighter pilot who operated out of British airfields in 1941, recalled that the escort operation which Rogers was involved in was a new tactic tried out for the first time in the Bethune raid. He also recalled in his memoirs that Rogers was shot down in a dogfight with a German pilot. 'During a series of engagements with enemy planes, 242 squadron lost three pilots of whom my flight commander, Rogers, was one. 'Rogers was a very fine chap and an extremely good pilot. He had many good qualities that were appreciated by everyone,' he wrote. 'The week before I had dined with him at his home. After his death, despite myself, I thought of his young wife who was expecting a baby in a few months.' One elderly Ambleteuse woman who declined to give her name said she had witnessed a German and a British plane dogfighting when she was a girl, walking with her father. 'I was here,' she said, standing on the wind-lashed beach, 'and saw them chasing each other in the skies above the port of Boulogne. You could see the English coast in the distance. 'The British plane was hit and it plummeted to the ground over there. I couldn't see where it crashed but I could see a plume of black smoke. The other plane flew off over the countryside.' The witness said she was certain it was Rogers's plane she had seen shot down because several days later her daughter was injured during bombardments in Rue Thiers in Ambleteuse. 'I can date it so precisely because I know when my daughter was hurt.' Another Ambleteuse resident, Ren\u00e9 Feutry, recalled that his father, Alexandre, was a voluntary fireman and was on duty on the day of the crash. 'I was just a baby at the time,' he said. 'But my father often spoke of the crash later. He said an English plane was shot down by a German fighter which had been in pursuit. 'My father and his colleagues rushed to put out the blaze that followed the crash. But German soldiers intervened and ordered them to do nothing.' It is not clear whether Rogers died in the crash or whether he burned to death in the wreckage. 'At the time, the German soldiers would let the pilots burn in their wreckage without helping them or allowing them to be helped,' said another Ambleteuse resident. 'People here even saw, in other crashes at Ambleteuse, some British pilots would be stoned if they were still alive.' According to the local paper, La Voix du Nord , Rogers's identity tag and 'a few fragments of his charred body' were buried by Nazi soldiers in a communal grave at the cemetery near the village. The rest of his body was covered over in the wreckage until last week. Rogers's 242 squadron was founded in World War I with mostly Canadian pilots. Dissolved in 1919, it was re-founded in 1939 under the motto 'Always Ready'. At the outset of the war it was based in France with British, Canadian and French pilots who mostly flew Hurricanes. The squadron, under the inspirational command of Douglas Bader, was later based at RAF Coltishall and saw much service in the Battle of Britain which took place between 10 July and 31 October in 1940. Of the 2,927 Royal Air Force and allied airmen who fought in the Battle of Britain, just 1,592 survived the war. Rogers is only the latest war pilot whose remains have been discovered recently. Last month the remains of US pilot Lieutenant William Patton and his P-51 Mustang were discovered during drainage work near the Belgian border. The bodies of three RAF pilots were found last autumn interred in a glacier in Iceland, nearly 60 years after their Fairey Battle bomber had crashed into a snow-covered mountain in May 1941. The pilot, Flight Officer Arthur Round, 26, a New Zealander, died in the mysterious crash along with two Britons, Flight Sergeant Keith Garrett, 22, and Flight Sergeant Reginald Hopkins, 21.",

He has been fired on by the Norwegian Coast Guard, attacked with rifles and tear gas by Faroese police, and been thrown in a Dutch jail.</p> <p>But Watson is not a mercenary, a drug baron or a mafia boss. He's probably the world's most extreme eco-activist, the self-styled 'Rambo of the environmental movement'. To whalers, governments and even other green campaigners, the Canadian is a terrorist. He was a co-founder of Greenpeace, but was ousted for being too violent. Now his life and exploits are about to be glorified in a new Hollywood film, Ocean Warrior .</p> <p>The \u00a330 million movie will star Aidan Quinn as Watson, Anne Heche as his girlfriend, and Billy Bob Thornton and Rutger Hauer as colleagues. Pierce Brosnan and Martin Sheen - big Watson supporters - will make cameo appearances.</p> <p>The film, due to start production in June, will be directed by John Badham, who directed Saturday Night Fever, WarGames and Stake Out. In preparation for the role, Quinn accompanied Watson on a trip to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands last December.</p> <p>Producer Pieter Kroonenburg said: 'There was a very dramatic story to tell. Here's a man obsessed with going after the pirate whalers and all those who rape and pillage the ocean. He's sort of an outcast - people don't know about him.'</p> <p>Watson grew up in Vancouver on the western coast of Canada, worked for the Norwegian merchant marine, and then with the Canadian Coast Guard. With friends he set sail to stop nuclear testing off the Alaskan Aleutian Islands, and then co-founded Greenpeace in 1972.</p> <p>By ramming them or scuttling them, Watson has sunk two Icelandic whaling vessels, two Spanish, four Norwegian and one Japanese. His direct action has saved hundreds of whales and led to the ban on the clubbing of seal pups. He also forced through a ban on the hunting of wolves by helicopter in North America. Last year Time magazine declared him environmental hero of the twentieth century.</p> <p>He was captain of all the Greenpeace whaling expeditions until 1977, when he was forced out after increasingly bitter arguments about his aggressive tactics. The final split came when he used direct action to stop the clubbing of Canadian seals. 'As a sealer's club descended towards the head of a seal pup, I ran forward, grabbed the sealer by the wrist, twisted the club from his grasp and threw it in the water,' he recalls in his memoirs.</p> <p>Watson picked up the seal and took it to safety, but was called before the board of directors of Greenpeace, which included lawyers, accountants and fundraisers. 'They accused me of acting violently and told me I had stolen property (the seal club). I was told I would have to apologise to the sealer. I refused,' said Watson, who was voted off the board and resigned.</p> <p>Members of Greenpeace often dismiss him as a terrorist and fanatic, and have even organised protests against his actions. Watson, who has been severely criticised in North American newspapers, has been keen for a film to give his version of events.</p> <p>Greenpeace was initially nervous about having its image damaged by the film.

      "bodyText": "Paul Watson has sunk nine ships and been pursued by the Soviet air force and navy. He has been fired on by the Norwegian Coast Guard, attacked with rifles and tear gas by Faroese police, and been thrown in a Dutch jail. But Watson is not a mercenary, a drug baron or a mafia boss. He's probably the world's most extreme eco-activist, the self-styled 'Rambo of the environmental movement'. To whalers, governments and even other green campaigners, the Canadian is a terrorist. He was a co-founder of Greenpeace, but was ousted for being too violent. Now his life and exploits are about to be glorified in a new Hollywood film, Ocean Warrior . The \u00a330 million movie will star Aidan Quinn as Watson, Anne Heche as his girlfriend, and Billy Bob Thornton and Rutger Hauer as colleagues. Pierce Brosnan and Martin Sheen - big Watson supporters - will make cameo appearances. The film, due to start production in June, will be directed by John Badham, who directed Saturday Night Fever, WarGames and Stake Out. In preparation for the role, Quinn accompanied Watson on a trip to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands last December. Producer Pieter Kroonenburg said: 'There was a very dramatic story to tell. Here's a man obsessed with going after the pirate whalers and all those who rape and pillage the ocean. He's sort of an outcast - people don't know about him.' Watson grew up in Vancouver on the western coast of Canada, worked for the Norwegian merchant marine, and then with the Canadian Coast Guard. With friends he set sail to stop nuclear testing off the Alaskan Aleutian Islands, and then co-founded Greenpeace in 1972. By ramming them or scuttling them, Watson has sunk two Icelandic whaling vessels, two Spanish, four Norwegian and one Japanese. His direct action has saved hundreds of whales and led to the ban on the clubbing of seal pups. He also forced through a ban on the hunting of wolves by helicopter in North America. Last year Time magazine declared him environmental hero of the twentieth century. He was captain of all the Greenpeace whaling expeditions until 1977, when he was forced out after increasingly bitter arguments about his aggressive tactics. The final split came when he used direct action to stop the clubbing of Canadian seals. 'As a sealer's club descended towards the head of a seal pup, I ran forward, grabbed the sealer by the wrist, twisted the club from his grasp and threw it in the water,' he recalls in his memoirs. Watson picked up the seal and took it to safety, but was called before the board of directors of Greenpeace, which included lawyers, accountants and fundraisers. 'They accused me of acting violently and told me I had stolen property (the seal club). I was told I would have to apologise to the sealer. I refused,' said Watson, who was voted off the board and resigned. Members of Greenpeace often dismiss him as a terrorist and fanatic, and have even organised protests against his actions. Watson, who has been severely criticised in North American newspapers, has been keen for a film to give his version of events. Greenpeace was initially nervous about having its image damaged by the film. However, they eventually decided to co-operate after ensuring that criticism was muted in return for letting the film-makers use the Greenpeace name. Miranda Holmes, of Greenpeace Canada, recently told the Vancouver Sun newspaper: 'Paul certainly had an interesting life that would make for a great movie. What can I say?' Watson says that he vowed to become a life-long defender of the creatures of the seas after seeing into the eye of a dying whale in a confrontation with a Russian whaler in 1975. A harpooned sperm whale loomed over Paul's small boat, and Paulthought he recognised a flicker of understanding. 'The whale's eye stared back, an eye the size of my fist, blackish brown and with a depth that astonished and gripped me. This was no brutish creature. The eye I saw reflected an intense intelligence.' The huge Russian whaler then rammed his boat. 'We were like mice, running before the onslaught of a descending meat cleaver,' he said. After leaving Greenpeace, Watson set up the environ ment group Sea Shepherd International to escalate his direct action. In 1979 he rammed the Sierra, thought to be the worst pirate whaling ship in history, killing an estimated 25,000 whales in ten years. Watson tracked it to Portugal and rammed the 650-tonne ship with his own 779-tonne one. He was ordered by a judge to hand over one of his own ships to the whalers as compensation, but instead he scuttled it. In 1980, he brought half of the Spanish whaling fleet to a standstill, and persuaded the South African government to confiscate two outlaw whaling ships, the Susan and the Theresa. He closed down the commercial Canadian seal hunt in 1983, followed by victories over seal hunts in Scotland and Ireland. In 1992, his crew scuttled the unmanned pirate whaler Nybraena as a 'Christmas gift to the whales'. Watson insists that, rather than breaking the law, he is enforcing it. 'We are often portrayed as an eco-terrorist group, but we're simply upholding international law,' says Watson, maintaining that Sea Shepherd respects and acts in accordance with international treaties and declarations. anthony.browne@observer.co.uk",

O'Byrne, Anna Friel, Billy Connolly </p> <p>The 15 minutes of John Herzfeld's satirical thriller are that quarter-hour of fame that Andy Warhol said everyone would have in the future. Searching for their moment in the spotlight and the subsequent spin-offs in the form of books and movies are the sly Czech criminal Emil Slovak, who comes to New York to collect a debt from a treacherous comrade, and his dim Russian sidekick Oleg. While Emil murders people, Oleg films their antics on a camcorder he steals on Fifth Avenue, and the ultimate aim of these natural born killers is to appear on Kelsey Grammer's high-paying, unscrupulous TV show Top Story. </p> <p>Chasing these crooks are ace homicide detective Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro) and inexperienced arson investigator Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns), a pair of decent public servants whose hands are tied by bureaucratic red-tape, whose actions are exploited and misrepresented by television, and who are traduced by the beneficiaries of victim culture. </p> <p>This slick, not unentertaining movie is a crude assault on the media, the legal profession and psychiatrists, and concludes with a rabble-rousing climax with the Statue of Liberty in the background. We're incited to violence, and bullets and punches are the catharsis. </p> <p>The body count in 15 Minutes is quite high, but the death toll in writer-director-editor Takeshi Kitano's <strong> Brother</strong>, his first gangster movie set in America, is larger than you'd find in a fairly serious earthquake. Takeshi himself plays a middle-aged yakuza who's sent into Californian exile after playing a leading role in a Toyko gang war. While a couple of bent cops appear in Japan, the US police are nowhere to be seen when he arrives in Los Angeles to join his younger brother, who has abandoned his university studies to work with a gang of black drug pushers. Takeshi immediately sets about instigating a succession of gang wars - blacks against Hispanics, blacks and Japanese against the established Little Tokyo gang, and finally Japanese against the Mafia. </p> <p>The killings are mostly by handgun or knife, though occasionally chopsticks are pushed up an informer's nostrils into his brain. The film is very cool, carefully composed and pared down, and everyone lives and dies by ancient codes. Like an Asian Charles Bronson, the stocky, bow-legged Takeshi strolls through it all, imperviously smoking, drinking beer and murdering people. It is a numbing experience. </p> <p>A more jocular approach to crime and law enforcement is found in <strong> Miss Congeniality</strong>, a police comedy starring its producer, Sandra Bullock, as a New Jersey tomboy who graduates from socking her male grade-school classmates to being an FBI agent. Her colleagues are so dumb they would probably say 'pass' if Anne Robinson asked them what FBI stands for, and when she convinces them that a mad bomber is planning to target the Miss United States pageant they press her into becoming an undercover agent. </p> <p>Such moving targets as beauty parades are sitting ducks for would-be satirists, and the picture has some amusing moments with Candice Bergen and William Shatner as the all-too-credible veteran presenters of the show. More laboured is the Henry Higgins-style makeover of Bullock into a beauty queen by gay British pageant consultant Victor Melling (Michael Caine reprising his seedy agent from Little Voice). Bullock, who acts with her nose the way some stars act with their eyes, is a likeable presence, and is much more attractive as a tomboy than as a made-up, depilated Miss New Jersey. </p> <p>Sean O'Casey was putting comic IRA men on the stage 80 years ago, and for more than 30 years now writers have been trying to see the funny side of the Ulster Troubles and find metaphors to capture its absurdity. Back in the mid-Seventies, for instance, Stewart Parker's Spokesong used a bicycle shop to represent Northern Ireland, and Bill Morrison's Flying Blind depicted a deranged world cruising helplessly without navigational aids. In the appallingly titled <strong>An Everlasting Piece</strong>, Barry Levinson has left the security of his native Baltimore to make a comedy set in 1980s Belfast where, God help us, the metaphor is hair. </p> <p>A Catholic barber (Barry McEvoy) and a Protestant barber (Brian F. O'Byrne) meet while giving short-back-and-sides to mental patients, and discover that one of the hospital's inmates (Billy Connolly) had the monopoly on selling wigs in the Six Counties until he was incarcerated as 'The Scalper'. With help from a feisty girlfriend (Anna Friel) they go into business peddling toupe\u00e9s as 'The Piece People', until they face a knock-out competition with a rival firm, 'Toup\u00e9e or not Toup\u00e9e'. Their work creates trouble on both sides of the fence, and also with the RUC who think they can capture a bald IRA leader through his captured toup\u00e9e and launch 'Operation Glass Slipper'. Can you guess where the police inspector loses the crucial hairpiece? </p> <p>The makers appreciate, more or less, that baldness isn't funny per se, but that toup\u00e9es, objects of vanity and embarrassment, are. But they turn serious and preachy at the end when our heroes and heroine decide that to win the business competition in its final two days they must target a special area of society. After rejecting cancer victims, they arrange a deal with the British Government to provide hairpieces for British soldiers who've contracted alopecia as a result of the stress of military service in Ulster. </p> <p>As someone who has lived with this condition for most of my life, I'm probably the person least qualified to review the picture. If I say it's rotten, I'll be considered a bad sport, though no one would say it to my face. If I praise it I'll be thought a good sport. So I'll neither raise nor flip the wig I have never worn.</p>",

Such moving targets as beauty parades are sitting ducks for would-be satirists, and the picture has some amusing moments with Candice Bergen and William Shatner as the all-too-credible veteran presenters of the show. More laboured is the Henry Higgins-style makeover of Bullock into a beauty queen by gay British pageant consultant Victor Melling (Michael Caine reprising his seedy agent from Little Voice). Bullock, who acts with her nose the way some stars act with their eyes, is a likeable presence, and is much more attractive as a tomboy than as a made-up, depilated Miss New Jersey. Sean O'Casey was putting comic IRA men on the stage 80 years ago, and for more than 30 years now writers have been trying to see the funny side of the Ulster Troubles and find metaphors to capture its absurdity. Back in the mid-Seventies, for instance, Stewart Parker's Spokesong used a bicycle shop to represent Northern Ireland, and Bill Morrison's Flying Blind depicted a deranged world cruising helplessly without navigational aids. In the appallingly titled An Everlasting Piece, Barry Levinson has left the security of his native Baltimore to make a comedy set in 1980s Belfast where, God help us, the metaphor is hair. A Catholic barber (Barry McEvoy) and a Protestant barber (Brian F. O'Byrne) meet while giving short-back-and-sides to mental patients, and discover that one of the hospital's inmates (Billy Connolly) had the monopoly on selling wigs in the Six Counties until he was incarcerated as 'The Scalper'. With help from a feisty girlfriend (Anna Friel) they go into business peddling toupe\u00e9s as 'The Piece People', until they face a knock-out competition with a rival firm, 'Toup\u00e9e or not Toup\u00e9e'. Their work creates trouble on both sides of the fence, and also with the RUC who think they can capture a bald IRA leader through his captured toup\u00e9e and launch 'Operation Glass Slipper'. Can you guess where the police inspector loses the crucial hairpiece? The makers appreciate, more or less, that baldness isn't funny per se, but that toup\u00e9es, objects of vanity and embarrassment, are. But they turn serious and preachy at the end when our heroes and heroine decide that to win the business competition in its final two days they must target a special area of society. After rejecting cancer victims, they arrange a deal with the British Government to provide hairpieces for British soldiers who've contracted alopecia as a result of the stress of military service in Ulster. As someone who has lived with this condition for most of my life, I'm probably the person least qualified to review the picture. If I say it's rotten, I'll be considered a bad sport, though no one would say it to my face. If I praise it I'll be thought a good sport. So I'll neither raise nor flip the wig I have never worn.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Happiness </strong> BBC2 <br><strong> Teachers </strong> C4 <br><strong> The Hunt</strong> ITV <br><strong> Silent Witness </strong> BBC1 </p> <p> When not hurtling down alpine pistes and sliding headfirst into conveniently situated vats of gluhwein, the week before last I read John O'Farrell's novel, The Best a Man Can Get. </p> <p>Towards the end of the book, the narrator/anti-hero Michael, a TV commercial jingles writer whose marriage has fallen apart through no fault but his own, is struggling to adapt Ken Dodd's 'Happiness' without breaching copyright, all the better to sell new Butterness: 'Butterness! Butterness! It tastes like butter but the fat is less.' </p> <p>Weeks, months, even years can go by without Ken Dodd impinging greatly on my consciousness, then last week he was to be found providing the irony soundtrack for Paul Whitehouse's new comedy drama, <strong> Happiness</strong>, or Butterness as I am now necessarily conditioned to call it. </p> <p>Coincidentally, Whitehouse's character, Danny, and O' Farrell's Michael both suffer from similar modern male-aises, jobs in which being professionally cheerful serve to exacerbate the emotional vacuity of their off-duty lives. In Whitehouse's case, this is, literally, the unbearable lightness of being a bear - providing the voice for Dexter (described as an 'animated kung-fu nurse bear'; a brief scene-stealingly realised by Wallace and Gromit creators, Aardman) shortly before attending his wife's funeral. </p> <p>But funny though this was, it wasn't even meant to be the funny bit; the show's comedic sting lies in the fact that Danny just isn't as cut up about his wife's death as he feels he should be. 'It hasn't sunk in yet,' observed all his friends pityingly, but, of course, Danny suspected that it had. </p> <p> Happiness has received some ferociously bad reviews, while even the gentler ones have said, in effect, 'Happiness! Happiness! It should be funny but the laughs are less'. Personally, I think it just hasn't sunk in yet; it's not The Fast Show but why on earth should it be? </p> <p>Whitehouse has, heroically, given almost all of the best lines away to the rest of his (excellent) cast, leaving himself as a kind of lugubrious comedy punchbag - one half Claymation bear ('I am Dexter'), one half hopelessly guilty, middle-aged, miserablist ('I've got a slow trundle into drool, piss and impotence at 40'), albeit with a very nice house. </p> <p> Happiness 's humour consistently disarms by switching deftly from dour pathos to slapstick to grimace-out-loud black comedy and, as a bonus, features an inspired compilation soundtrack. Where else on TV could one be taken on a journey from Ken Dodd to Elvis Costello via 'Angels' and 'Misty Blue' in a mere 29 minutes? Mmmm, nice! </p> <p>It was a good week in which to judge a series by its covers. Entirely befitting its self-conscious tilt at hipness, <strong> Teachers</strong> opted for a selection of semi-familiar jangly geetar toons that I couldn't quite place (Suede, maybe, plus some other bands that came and went in the charts of 1993), which provided the soundtrack for Andrew Lincoln's Simon (This Life 's Egg) and his kidult teacher colleagues. Teachers has, in effect, only one joke, but it's an entertaining one - teachers aren't grown-ups, they just pretend to be! They drink, they swear, they steal, they have casual sex, they smoke in the loos - and thankfully the sum total of the square root of the action was more Grange Hill than Hope and Glory . </p> <p>Still, it seems you can't be a TV teacher without, deep-down, dreaming of running the state-subsidised branch of the Dead Poet's Society. Simon might have an earring, be called by his first name in class and teach Romeo and Juliet with reference to Ryan Giggs, but underneath he's just another old-fashioned mentor who needs must, despite himself, coax wannabe teenage mothers and nascent glue-sniffers to fight their demons and find themselves in literature, whatever the fuck it takes. And in Teachers, it takes a fuck of a lot of 'fucks'. </p> <p>So to ITV's deliriously rubbishy and utterly addictive <strong> The Hunt</strong>, a rural romplet filling an important dramatic niche somewhere between Jilly Cooper and Joanna Trollope. Here, the only Suede to be found was on the seat of one's Herm\u00e8s saddle and the 'fucks' flew fast but never glottally-stoppered. </p> <p>Soundtrack-wise - mysteriously, mischievously? - The Hunt included Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls' in the scene during which Adrian Lukis, as Hugh, a deliciously lascivious country squire, first eyed-up Amanda Holden's pert posterior on horseback. </p> <p>Holden's Sarah is a townie, an expensive blonde who refuses to let the hunt ride over her land and for whom foot and mouth is a problem best dealt with in Bond and Harley Streets, married to rich mockney pop promoter, Rob (the woefully underused Philip Glenister). Sarah falls for Hugh for no reason other than that this provides Holden (otherwise known as Mrs Les Dennis, who last year famously had a fling with Neil Morrissey) with the excuse to get drunk and say the potentially ratings-grabbing line: 'I don't want to talk about my husband at the moment, thank you very much.' </p> <p>The plot, the script, the scenes in drawing-rooms that started abruptly with the tinkle of cut-crystal laughter, were all treats and everybody acted their cashmere socks off with dialogue that could have come straight from Crossroads . Here, for example, is the exchange between the (dis)honourably smouldering Hugh and Fiona, his local, lower-class bit on the side: </p> <p>'Things have run their natural course, Fiona.' (Cool, dispassionate.) </p> <p>'But you're the one thing that makes me feel special.' (Desperate.) </p> <p>'I'm sorry, I really think it's better this way.' (Turns away.) </p> <p>'You can't just throw me away like some piece of rubbish!' (Anguished.) </p> <p>'You knew exactly what I had to offer.' (Distancing himself now.) </p> <p>'Hugh! I need you!' (Hugh, gimlet-eyed, callously stubs out a cigarette on Fiona's filthy, feckless, working-class plates before caddishly turning on his Achilles heel, leaving her to the inevitable wrath of her cuckolded husband, Clem, who might actually be a poacher and certainly has a shotgun and who has, anyway, already spotted Hugh and the missus up to no good in Hugh's 4x4 etc.) </p> <p>I loved every minute of The Hunt and regret only that it finishes this week and that any future ban on the sport will presumably put paid to credits thanking the Vale of Aylesbury Hunt, whose hounds and followers starred. Hopefully, however, a few old hunts (no, not a typographical error) will survive for purely dramatic purposes, kept in carcasses, stirrup-cups, new horns and pink coats by the makers of addictively glossy rural tosh, a fine television tradition that no right-thinking British viewer will ever want to see die out, I'm sure. </p> <p>Siiii-lent! Wiiit-ness! The plots are good but the prof's a mess: 'I think it would be dangerous to encourage optimism in a situation like this,' said Professor Sam Ryan's doctor gravely, while he studied her X-rays in last week's <strong> Silent Witness</strong>. No danger of that, Doc, given that Ryan is never optimistic about anything other than her ability to pinpoint the exact time and cause of other people's death. </p> <p>Though, even by Sam's standards, last week's events took a particularly downbeat turn: a dark shadow had clouded Sam's lungs even as the habitual cloud of intense doom shadowed her Spock-ish brow. In the grand scheme of Sam's emotions, this news suggested that she might be a wee bit snappier and somewhat slammier-of-doors than usual. And, lo, it came to pass. </p> <p>The doctor's suggestion of a holiday was easy for Sam to ignore. Instead of popping round to a mate's for a cup of tea and a bit of a 'woe-is-me' before booking herself a fortnight in Jamaica at Hedonism 2, she made a quick visit to the scene of a high-profile shotgun suicide before slamming a door and departing for a gloom-laden seaside mini-break in a grim guest house, with the uniquely fun-laden opportunity to disinter a beatified, mummified nun who needed just one more miracle to her name in order to be canonised. </p> <p>Odd really, if not mildly miraculous, that Sam's creators have allowed her to grapple with the prospect of losing her life without ever having given her one to lose in the first place. Still, if the prognosis for the show's long-term survival looks increasingly slim, Sam would make a suitably miserable cameo wife for Paul Whitehouse.</p>",

'It hasn't sunk in yet,' observed all his friends pityingly, but, of course, Danny suspected that it had. Happiness has received some ferociously bad reviews, while even the gentler ones have said, in effect, 'Happiness! Happiness! It should be funny but the laughs are less'. Personally, I think it just hasn't sunk in yet; it's not The Fast Show but why on earth should it be? Whitehouse has, heroically, given almost all of the best lines away to the rest of his (excellent) cast, leaving himself as a kind of lugubrious comedy punchbag - one half Claymation bear ('I am Dexter'), one half hopelessly guilty, middle-aged, miserablist ('I've got a slow trundle into drool, piss and impotence at 40'), albeit with a very nice house. Happiness 's humour consistently disarms by switching deftly from dour pathos to slapstick to grimace-out-loud black comedy and, as a bonus, features an inspired compilation soundtrack. Where else on TV could one be taken on a journey from Ken Dodd to Elvis Costello via 'Angels' and 'Misty Blue' in a mere 29 minutes? Mmmm, nice! It was a good week in which to judge a series by its covers. Entirely befitting its self-conscious tilt at hipness, Teachers opted for a selection of semi-familiar jangly geetar toons that I couldn't quite place (Suede, maybe, plus some other bands that came and went in the charts of 1993), which provided the soundtrack for Andrew Lincoln's Simon (This Life 's Egg) and his kidult teacher colleagues. Teachers has, in effect, only one joke, but it's an entertaining one - teachers aren't grown-ups, they just pretend to be! They drink, they swear, they steal, they have casual sex, they smoke in the loos - and thankfully the sum total of the square root of the action was more Grange Hill than Hope and Glory . Still, it seems you can't be a TV teacher without, deep-down, dreaming of running the state-subsidised branch of the Dead Poet's Society. Simon might have an earring, be called by his first name in class and teach Romeo and Juliet with reference to Ryan Giggs, but underneath he's just another old-fashioned mentor who needs must, despite himself, coax wannabe teenage mothers and nascent glue-sniffers to fight their demons and find themselves in literature, whatever the fuck it takes. And in Teachers, it takes a fuck of a lot of 'fucks'. So to ITV's deliriously rubbishy and utterly addictive The Hunt, a rural romplet filling an important dramatic niche somewhere between Jilly Cooper and Joanna Trollope. Here, the only Suede to be found was on the seat of one's Herm\u00e8s saddle and the 'fucks' flew fast but never glottally-stoppered. Soundtrack-wise - mysteriously, mischievously? - The Hunt included Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls' in the scene during which Adrian Lukis, as Hugh, a deliciously lascivious country squire, first eyed-up Amanda Holden's pert posterior on horseback. Holden's Sarah is a townie, an expensive blonde who refuses to let the hunt ride over her land and for whom foot and mouth is a problem best dealt with in Bond and Harley Streets, married to rich mockney pop promoter, Rob (the woefully underused Philip Glenister). Sarah falls for Hugh for no reason other than that this provides Holden (otherwise known as Mrs Les Dennis, who last year famously had a fling with Neil Morrissey) with the excuse to get drunk and say the potentially ratings-grabbing line: 'I don't want to talk about my husband at the moment, thank you very much.' The plot, the script, the scenes in drawing-rooms that started abruptly with the tinkle of cut-crystal laughter, were all treats and everybody acted their cashmere socks off with dialogue that could have come straight from Crossroads . Here, for example, is the exchange between the (dis)honourably smouldering Hugh and Fiona, his local, lower-class bit on the side: 'Things have run their natural course, Fiona.' (Cool, dispassionate.) 'But you're the one thing that makes me feel special.' (Desperate.) 'I'm sorry, I really think it's better this way.' (Turns away.) 'You can't just throw me away like some piece of rubbish!' (Anguished.) 'You knew exactly what I had to offer.' (Distancing himself now.) 'Hugh! I need you!' (Hugh, gimlet-eyed, callously stubs out a cigarette on Fiona's filthy, feckless, working-class plates before caddishly turning on his Achilles heel, leaving her to the inevitable wrath of her cuckolded husband, Clem, who might actually be a poacher and certainly has a shotgun and who has, anyway, already spotted Hugh and the missus up to no good in Hugh's 4x4 etc.) I loved every minute of The Hunt and regret only that it finishes this week and that any future ban on the sport will presumably put paid to credits thanking the Vale of Aylesbury Hunt, whose hounds and followers starred. Hopefully, however, a few old hunts (no, not a typographical error) will survive for purely dramatic purposes, kept in carcasses, stirrup-cups, new horns and pink coats by the makers of addictively glossy rural tosh, a fine television tradition that no right-thinking British viewer will ever want to see die out, I'm sure. Siiii-lent! Wiiit-ness! The plots are good but the prof's a mess: 'I think it would be dangerous to encourage optimism in a situation like this,' said Professor Sam Ryan's doctor gravely, while he studied her X-rays in last week's Silent Witness. No danger of that, Doc, given that Ryan is never optimistic about anything other than her ability to pinpoint the exact time and cause of other people's death. Though, even by Sam's standards, last week's events took a particularly downbeat turn: a dark shadow had clouded Sam's lungs even as the habitual cloud of intense doom shadowed her Spock-ish brow. In the grand scheme of Sam's emotions, this news suggested that she might be a wee bit snappier and somewhat slammier-of-doors than usual. And, lo, it came to pass. The doctor's suggestion of a holiday was easy for Sam to ignore. Instead of popping round to a mate's for a cup of tea and a bit of a 'woe-is-me' before booking herself a fortnight in Jamaica at Hedonism 2, she made a quick visit to the scene of a high-profile shotgun suicide before slamming a door and departing for a gloom-laden seaside mini-break in a grim guest house, with the uniquely fun-laden opportunity to disinter a beatified, mummified nun who needed just one more miracle to her name in order to be canonised. Odd really, if not mildly miraculous, that Sam's creators have allowed her to grapple with the prospect of losing her life without ever having given her one to lose in the first place. Still, if the prognosis for the show's long-term survival looks increasingly slim, Sam would make a suitably miserable cameo wife for Paul Whitehouse.",

      "body": "<p>The 291 Gallery in Hackney is a former church converted into a bar, restaurant and art space. Tonight it is playing host to Extrasensory, a show of installations and electronic sound art. A car and a tent, both wired for sound in different ways, occupy the main space. In a side chapel, past a sculpture that rises and falls with hot air, an artist called Sachiko M is sitting at a laptop, playing a work that is so minimal it is barely there at all. The woman next to us on the sofa is fast asleep, and starting to snore. I'm glad it's Talvin Singh who breaks first, suppressing a giggle and suggesting we leave.</p> <p>It seems there are two Talvin Singhs, both of them Londoners who play the tablas and DJ at various clubs. One of them is the arrogant, pompous name-dropper you may have read about in recent interviews to promote his new album Ha, a man who takes himself too seriously by half. The other is the charming, funny man I've often met in clubs who talks a million ideas a minute and always has some new person to introduce, new project on the go. It's this Talvin I'm out with tonight.</p> <p>We move on to a relaxed night at the Mint Bar in Clerkenwell, where the sari-clad DJ Siren is playing classical music 'mainly Western, with a little Indian thrown in' over gentle dance beats. Here we meet up with Talvin's friend Suchitra, an actress making a short visit to London from Bombay; with Mukul, a DJ who is just back from university in California; and Shwetul, another long-time friend. Over dinner and a few glasses of wine, the conversation moves from Bombay bars to the effects of the dot.com boom in San Francisco and Bangalore, takes in the video Talvin was making the night before with Jerry Dammers and an Asian breakdance crew from Hitchin, and somehow ends with us discovering that most of our parents own Jim Reeves records. Although Talvin's dad at least had the grace to buy the disco classic 'Car Wash' too.</p> <p>Talvin Singh was born in Leytonstone, east London, where he still lives. His mother is from Madhya Pradesh in India, his father from the Punjab via Uganda. Here, Raghbir Singh worked as a TV engineer at Granada, and is still a bit of a dab hand with non-digital electronics - which comes in useful when his son wants his analogue synths fixed. Retired now, Raghbir watches a lot of Bollywood movies with his wife. Which is weird, Talvin says, because he was more of a Clint Eastwood man before.</p> <p>Talvin first showed interest in playing the tabla at the age of four. At 16 he went to India to study for two years. Before that, learning wasn't always easy. Some in London's close-knit Indian classical scene were helpful, others less so: 'I had to hustle.' Whenever any of the Indian masters was playing at the Royal Festival Hall he'd go down there early, try and get backstage: 'To show my respect to the artists, and hoping they'd show me a lick or two.'</p> <p>Last year Talvin did a tour performing solo, just him, his tablas and a visual artist reacting to the complex rhythms live on screens around the venues. He played a couple of nights at the Union Chapel in London, rose petals strewn on the floor, candles lit all around him, and many of the 'classical policemen' who used to dismiss him now in the audience. 'They all want me to record with them now,' he says coolly. 'I greet them, but I'm like, \"Yeah. Tomorrow\".' He's equally dismissive of Western artists who try to call him in to add exotica. 'I can't be arsed with people who borrow other cultures just to make themselves seem a bit spicy.'</p> <p>Some would see this as arrogance, but he loves interacting with other musicians and sees his solo albums more as collaborations with a cast he's assembled and directed, like a movie. He just doesn't like being used, and mentions a concert he did with one big star, who took in Talvin's quilted Nehru jacket from Alexander McQueen, then asked, 'Why aren't you wearing something Indian?'</p> <p>Growing up, there was other music too, sounds which to varying degrees resurface in his work now. Like many suburban boys, Talvin liked The Jam and affected a mod look for a while. When electro hit the UK, he hung out with local breakdancers and bought an 808 drum machine which he later used to keep time while practising his tablas. There was the dub reggae that appealed to so many London Asians, a thriving jazz scene, and when acid house took off he would go to the clubs and watch. 'I wasn't taking pills. It was only later I found out it was inspired by ecstasy. I just liked seeing it all. And it wasn't just white people - black people were into this new electronic sound.'</p> <p>He never felt comfortable mixing his Indian training with house music, even though he loved it. But when drum'n'bass came along, like many young Britons he found a music in which all his influences fitted comfortably.</p> <p>Anxious to prove that his parents' investment in him had been worthwhile, on his return from India Talvin had thrown himself into session work, playing on bhangra records, and with artists like Bj\u00f6rk, Sun-Ra, Massive Attack, Courtney Pine and Siouxsie Sioux. But it wasn't until the monthly club night Anokha ('unique' in Hindi) that things really came together. While Indian classics played in an ambient soundscape upstairs, Talvin would play drum'n'bass records downstairs, with jazz singer/jungle MC Cleveland Watkiss often performing live over the mix and West End club girls dancing in trainers and saris. The first Anokha compilation, billed as 'soundz of the Asian underground', came out in 1997, and a year later Talvin released OK, the album which was to win him the Mercury Music Prize.</p> <p>Since OK, he has collaborated on an album with New York producer Bill Laswell and tabla master Zakir Hussain under the name Tabla Beat Science. He went to the mountains of Morocco to produce an album by the Master Musicians of Joujuka. He's also spent more and more time in India, where he recently began doing his TV interviews in Hindi and Punjabi for the first time. His records don't sell particularly well there - most Indian kids with access to the internet download their music instead. But right now Talvin is more concerned with explaining himself, setting himself up for the long term.</p> <p>'My deal with a major label is not going to last for too long - the two albums I've made for Island are hardly commercial - but hopefully I've got years of making music.' And plans, lots of plans. There will be another Anokha compilation this year, and the club recently reopened in a new monthly home in Brick Lane. There will be a series of collaborations released on his own label, and he's hoping to bring his elderly teacher Ustad Lakshman Singh to Britain for the first time as part of a Meltdown festival he's programming on the South Bank in April. The Aids awareness organisation Red Hot and Blue has asked him to make a compilation, but he's hoping to convince them to commission new work instead. He wants to travel round India collaborating with regional artists - Punjabi folk musicians, Tamil rappers - to make music which might reach people an advertising campaign would not.</p> <p>As he talks, Talvin sprays out ideas: a book, a compilation, a film, an artwork, a new collaboration. Some are forgotten a day later. He works at others with an awesome tenacity until they come off. His enthusiasm is infectious, and you find yourself volunteering to edit the book, appear in the film. In his thirties now, he says his new challenge is finding a balance - having a life with room for something other than music.</p> <p>We ended our night out at Herbal, a small, crowded club in Shoreditch where Damien, a DJ friend of Talvin from the acid house era, is playing hard, bass-heavy beats while an MC delivers a frenetic, staccato stream of consciousness. In the space of a few hours, in one small part of London, we'd taken in experimental electronica played by Japanese and Canadian artists, Western classical music mixed by a British-Indian DJ and banging dance beats with rapping by an MC whose parents are probably Caribbean. None of it seemed particularly unusual. It's what living in London - in almost any of Britain's cosmopolitan cities - is all about.</p> <p>Earlier we'd been talking about the classical purists who have questioned Singh's right to fuse his traditional training with more modern influences.

My Indian classical roots, my dance roots, that whole mod underground vibe, it's all part of me. Part of us. We're not fusing anything. It's in us already.'</p> <p>Ha is out now on Island.

      "bodyText": "The 291 Gallery in Hackney is a former church converted into a bar, restaurant and art space. Tonight it is playing host to Extrasensory, a show of installations and electronic sound art. A car and a tent, both wired for sound in different ways, occupy the main space. In a side chapel, past a sculpture that rises and falls with hot air, an artist called Sachiko M is sitting at a laptop, playing a work that is so minimal it is barely there at all. The woman next to us on the sofa is fast asleep, and starting to snore. I'm glad it's Talvin Singh who breaks first, suppressing a giggle and suggesting we leave. It seems there are two Talvin Singhs, both of them Londoners who play the tablas and DJ at various clubs. One of them is the arrogant, pompous name-dropper you may have read about in recent interviews to promote his new album Ha, a man who takes himself too seriously by half. The other is the charming, funny man I've often met in clubs who talks a million ideas a minute and always has some new person to introduce, new project on the go. It's this Talvin I'm out with tonight. We move on to a relaxed night at the Mint Bar in Clerkenwell, where the sari-clad DJ Siren is playing classical music 'mainly Western, with a little Indian thrown in' over gentle dance beats. Here we meet up with Talvin's friend Suchitra, an actress making a short visit to London from Bombay; with Mukul, a DJ who is just back from university in California; and Shwetul, another long-time friend. Over dinner and a few glasses of wine, the conversation moves from Bombay bars to the effects of the dot.com boom in San Francisco and Bangalore, takes in the video Talvin was making the night before with Jerry Dammers and an Asian breakdance crew from Hitchin, and somehow ends with us discovering that most of our parents own Jim Reeves records. Although Talvin's dad at least had the grace to buy the disco classic 'Car Wash' too. Talvin Singh was born in Leytonstone, east London, where he still lives. His mother is from Madhya Pradesh in India, his father from the Punjab via Uganda. Here, Raghbir Singh worked as a TV engineer at Granada, and is still a bit of a dab hand with non-digital electronics - which comes in useful when his son wants his analogue synths fixed. Retired now, Raghbir watches a lot of Bollywood movies with his wife. Which is weird, Talvin says, because he was more of a Clint Eastwood man before. Talvin first showed interest in playing the tabla at the age of four. At 16 he went to India to study for two years. Before that, learning wasn't always easy. Some in London's close-knit Indian classical scene were helpful, others less so: 'I had to hustle.' Whenever any of the Indian masters was playing at the Royal Festival Hall he'd go down there early, try and get backstage: 'To show my respect to the artists, and hoping they'd show me a lick or two.' Last year Talvin did a tour performing solo, just him, his tablas and a visual artist reacting to the complex rhythms live on screens around the venues. He played a couple of nights at the Union Chapel in London, rose petals strewn on the floor, candles lit all around him, and many of the 'classical policemen' who used to dismiss him now in the audience. 'They all want me to record with them now,' he says coolly. 'I greet them, but I'm like, \"Yeah. Tomorrow\".' He's equally dismissive of Western artists who try to call him in to add exotica. 'I can't be arsed with people who borrow other cultures just to make themselves seem a bit spicy.' Some would see this as arrogance, but he loves interacting with other musicians and sees his solo albums more as collaborations with a cast he's assembled and directed, like a movie.

      "body": "<p><strong> Lulu</strong> Almeida at King's Cross, London N1 <br><strong> Boston Marriage</strong> Donmar, London WC2 <br><strong> Semi-Monde</strong> Lyric, London W1<br><strong> A Midsummer Night's Dream</strong> Albery, London WC2 </p> <p> What goes wrong when men write plays about women? No one thinks that Hamlet is about a crisis in masculinity simply because the Prince is a man. But a play with a female in the lead is liable to be interpreted, not as an exploration of human beings, but as a vehicle for a girl, or the occasion for a debate about women's lot. </p> <p>The Almeida's <strong> Lulu</strong> is a case in point. Wedekind's turn-of-the-last-century tale has always been tricky to stage. A young girl behaves like an old-fashioned man-about-town. She glides unceremoniously from lover to lover. She leaves a trail of dumped (and often dead) dopes in her wake. And she ends up as a victim of Jack the Ripper. Is she a cad or a free spirit? Is she an altogether new kind of creature? A strong production would raise these questions. A weak one, such as this, makes the drama more insipid: the story of a silly girl in pretty frocks who gets caught up in a glum French farce. </p> <p>This is infuriating, because Jonathan Kent's staging is surrounded by good ideas. The Almeida is to theatre what Penguin has been to books: you want to get the full set of whatever they produce, and once you've got it, you have a good grasp of what's going on in contemporary theatre. One of the things that's going on is a shift in the idea of what a theatre should be - and a growth in the notion that a show doesn't always stop at the door. </p> <p>While their Islington building is being improved, the Almeida have taken over a 1930s coach station in King's Cross, just down from the railway arches where the girls tout for business, just along from Thameslink, where the dealers hang around. On the opening night, a stream of Crombies tumbled out of taxis and fell on the Big Issue sellers in their attempts to find Omega Place. It is, you might think, a perfectly themed setting for Lulu. </p> <p>And inside, the space - with its elongated stage, steeply raked seats, its smell of timber and absence of plush - feels dynamic. Rob Howell's design looks alluring: a concertina of tarnished mirrors unfolds at the front of the stage; more mirrors at the back suggest an infinite peepshow; throughout, the figure of Jack the Ripper lurks in the wings. But then the show begins. </p> <p>The width of the stage sucks up energy: everyone takes ages to cross it; characters standing at far ends of the action look as if they're taking part in different plays. All the male actors are stolid, apart from Alan Howard, who twirls his cane and warbles. Anna Friel never looks less than delectable, but the underplaying that made her seem natural in Brookside makes her appear flat here: her voice is thin, and her gestures mechanical. For the first time, a play directed by Jonathan Kent - famous for whizzing the action along - creaks with slowness. </p> <p>It's often said of David Mamet that he can't write about women. His new play rises to that challenge. <strong> Boston Marriage</strong> is a bloke-free zone: indeed, of its female cast of three, two of them aren't interested in men other than as walking money bags. </p> <p>'Boston marriage' is late nineteenth-century New England parlance for a monogamous, long-lasting, probably sexual relationship between two women. Anna and Claire (Zo\u00eb Wanamaker and Anna Chancellor) are engaged on such a relationship; their maid (Lyndsey Marshal) is a lusty little hetero. The plot hinges on two characters who never appear. To keep the household going, Anna has felt obliged to succumb to a sugar daddy; meanwhile, Claire is attracted to a younger girl; these two characters turn out to be linked. But the play hinges on something different: on a verbal trick. </p> <p>Trying to resolve the tensions that have arisen between them, the characters slide between violently contrasting styles of dialogue. Most of their talk is made up of contorted sentences batted speedily at each other, as if Henry James were playing ping-pong with himself: they 'garner', they 'opine', and they drawl: 'Did I say abjure hypocrisy?' But then suddenly they lurch from the la-di-da to the direct and demotic, bursting out with: 'get off my tits', 'tell that to the marines'. The effect is quite often funny, quite often dirty. It's skilfully executed by strung-up, abstracted Wanamaker, and Chancellor - barbed and elegant as if she's strayed in from a Restoration comedy. Marshal's maid is full-on and natural. </p> <p>But to what purpose? This switching between two ways of speaking is simply a game which engages the audience with its hard-to-follow cleverness, and tells you nothing interesting or intimate about its characters.

      "bodyText": "Lulu Almeida at King's Cross, London N1 Boston Marriage Donmar, London WC2 Semi-Monde Lyric, London W1 A Midsummer Night's Dream Albery, London WC2 What goes wrong when men write plays about women? No one thinks that Hamlet is about a crisis in masculinity simply because the Prince is a man. But a play with a female in the lead is liable to be interpreted, not as an exploration of human beings, but as a vehicle for a girl, or the occasion for a debate about women's lot. The Almeida's Lulu is a case in point. Wedekind's turn-of-the-last-century tale has always been tricky to stage. A young girl behaves like an old-fashioned man-about-town. She glides unceremoniously from lover to lover. She leaves a trail of dumped (and often dead) dopes in her wake. And she ends up as a victim of Jack the Ripper. Is she a cad or a free spirit? Is she an altogether new kind of creature? A strong production would raise these questions. A weak one, such as this, makes the drama more insipid: the story of a silly girl in pretty frocks who gets caught up in a glum French farce. This is infuriating, because Jonathan Kent's staging is surrounded by good ideas. The Almeida is to theatre what Penguin has been to books: you want to get the full set of whatever they produce, and once you've got it, you have a good grasp of what's going on in contemporary theatre. One of the things that's going on is a shift in the idea of what a theatre should be - and a growth in the notion that a show doesn't always stop at the door. While their Islington building is being improved, the Almeida have taken over a 1930s coach station in King's Cross, just down from the railway arches where the girls tout for business, just along from Thameslink, where the dealers hang around. On the opening night, a stream of Crombies tumbled out of taxis and fell on the Big Issue sellers in their attempts to find Omega Place. It is, you might think, a perfectly themed setting for Lulu. And inside, the space - with its elongated stage, steeply raked seats, its smell of timber and absence of plush - feels dynamic. Rob Howell's design looks alluring: a concertina of tarnished mirrors unfolds at the front of the stage; more mirrors at the back suggest an infinite peepshow; throughout, the figure of Jack the Ripper lurks in the wings. But then the show begins. The width of the stage sucks up energy: everyone takes ages to cross it; characters standing at far ends of the action look as if they're taking part in different plays. All the male actors are stolid, apart from Alan Howard, who twirls his cane and warbles. Anna Friel never looks less than delectable, but the underplaying that made her seem natural in Brookside makes her appear flat here: her voice is thin, and her gestures mechanical. For the first time, a play directed by Jonathan Kent - famous for whizzing the action along - creaks with slowness. It's often said of David Mamet that he can't write about women. His new play rises to that challenge. Boston Marriage is a bloke-free zone: indeed, of its female cast of three, two of them aren't interested in men other than as walking money bags. 'Boston marriage' is late nineteenth-century New England parlance for a monogamous, long-lasting, probably sexual relationship between two women. Anna and Claire (Zo\u00eb Wanamaker and Anna Chancellor) are engaged on such a relationship; their maid (Lyndsey Marshal) is a lusty little hetero. The plot hinges on two characters who never appear. To keep the household going, Anna has felt obliged to succumb to a sugar daddy; meanwhile, Claire is attracted to a younger girl; these two characters turn out to be linked. But the play hinges on something different: on a verbal trick. Trying to resolve the tensions that have arisen between them, the characters slide between violently contrasting styles of dialogue. Most of their talk is made up of contorted sentences batted speedily at each other, as if Henry James were playing ping-pong with himself: they 'garner', they 'opine', and they drawl: 'Did I say abjure hypocrisy?' But then suddenly they lurch from the la-di-da to the direct and demotic, bursting out with: 'get off my tits', 'tell that to the marines'. The effect is quite often funny, quite often dirty. It's skilfully executed by strung-up, abstracted Wanamaker, and Chancellor - barbed and elegant as if she's strayed in from a Restoration comedy. Marshal's maid is full-on and natural. But to what purpose? This switching between two ways of speaking is simply a game which engages the audience with its hard-to-follow cleverness, and tells you nothing interesting or intimate about its characters. Its a variation on the madonna-whore theory about women: either they're prim, or they're filthy. What they never are is inflected, inner or real. There's more (and more predictable) drawling in Semi-Monde, where you'd be hard put to distinguish between the speech of the men and women.

      "body": "<p><strong> Stanley Spencer</strong> Tate Britain, London SW1 until 24 June </p> <p> When Stanley Spencer died in 1959, at the age of 68, he was commemorated as an ingenuous misfit, the little tramp who trundled his paints around Cookham in the rickety pram of his childhood. Spencer joined no movements, gathered no disciples, never took the ritual trip to Paris. </p> <p>He seemed as impervious to modern art as he was to old age, turning up to receive a knighthood in the schoolboy fringe and specs he'd worn since short trousers. Time stood still in Spencer's life as in his art. 'Cookham' was his nickname at the Slade because he always took the 5.10 home, which was where he died, in the very house of his birth. </p> <p>Every show of Spencer's art - and this is the fourth in the last 10 years - aims to rescue him from that Berkshire village, to make him a European master instead of a quaint provincial. Sometimes, this feels like guilty pleading, as if the curators themselves were mildly embarrassed by Spencer's passion for local matrons in floral dresses, his churchyard love-ins, his angels in jerseys. Sometimes, the perfectly obvious is needlessly restated - that Spencer saw heaven in Cookham and God in sex. </p> <p>But what is less often remarked, perhaps because it is wrongly seen to count against him, is just how surpassingly odd Spencer's art was and remains, total self-exposure in an age of high modernism. </p> <p>At Tate Britain, you can see Spencer whole for the first time in years, witness the unfolding of his life through more than 100 paintings. The architect Claudio Silvestrin has turned the gallery into a minimalist church, a central nave with subsidiary aisles and side-chapels, something like the small cathedral Spencer envisaged for his work. More than that, Silvestrin has painted the walls a shade of eau de nil that immediately evokes Sunday school in the vestry and tea-urns at the village hall. The ambience is delicately tuned to Spencer's 'holy suburb' in its perpetual afternoon - hydrangea by the front door, swallows in the eaves and dusty ivy creeping round the redbrick porches. </p> <p>Everything, of course, is holy to Spencer - rusty railings, masonry, flowerpots and flapping bloomers, wellingtons, car tyres, cloth caps and inner-tubes. His all-together-now principle is both spiritual and aesthetic - nothing must be lost, even if it jams the picture. </p> <p>In The Dustman, he paints Cookham children proffering some garbage - jars, crockery, a wilted cabbage - as sacramental gifts to the dustman who is lightly borne up to heaven in the brawny arms of his wife. The painting is fully as mad as it sounds and pieced together in more fragments than the eye can handle. But it reverses the dust-to-dust rule with its faith in physical redemption - all will be restored, even the decomposing cabbage, in the wondrous hereafter. </p> <p>The image of the puny man and the giant dame is so central to Spencer's art that many people regard this painting as an allegorical self-portrait - Stanley carried by Daphne Charlton, one of the women who sustained him after the death of his second marriage. Spencer was only a little over five feet tall and often made himself seem smaller - a stripling dwarfed and overawed by bolster-bosomed matrons in voluminous garments. </p> <p>You see this over and again in paintings of his first wife, the artist Hilda Carline, who towers above him as they toast crumpets and nearly knocks him over as they choose clothes from an overflowing chest of drawers. Hilda was no bigger than Stanley and her grace and beauty are always evident in his drawings. But something happens in the transformation to canvas - she swells in his memory, distorts in his prodigious fancy. </p> <p>Spencer was a virgin when he married at the age of 34. His expectations must have been considerable, but their fulfilment was a revelation. Resurrection at Cookham, the most famous of all his works, is not just a vision of the dead clambering from their graves - more overcrowded drawers - but an altarpiece to sexual love, aptly displayed above a flight of steps at Tate Britain. The new bride appears not once but three times, worshipped by little Stanley. In the drawings, Hilda is wary and introspective, especially when naked. Here, she lacks all self-consciousness, has become an innocent in Spencer's fantasy of paradise. </p> <p>What did that mean for this unorthodox Methodist? It meant love, if not peace, as people burst through Cookham, parading, hugging, snogging and swooning. Heaven is crude; its inhabitants grapple on the village green, their lust a childish frieze of squinting glances and awkward embraces. At its best, it is a sudden awakening from sleep and the burden of free will. At its worst, as in the caricatural Love Among the Nations, it means Africans with nose-rings and steatopygous buttocks fondling stout matrons, an absurd hybrid of Donald McGill and National Geographic. </p> <p>This is not meant as satire, any more than the unlikely couples in Spencer's Beatitudes from the 1930s, with their buck-teeth, claw hands and bulbous bellies. Spencer, as the early works in this show make clear, was the natural heir to the pre-Raphaelites, his narratives as religious as they were deeply sincere. One of his daughters has said that Spencer painted 'to make things lovable' and this is confirmed in his writings. But there is nothing loving in the paint itself. </p> <p>It is always a shock to see the pictures in reality, instead of reproduction. Spencer squared up in pencil and then applied colour as mechanically as if painting by numbers, the pigment lying sterile and parched on the canvas. His desires, his passions - they seem to die away as he paints. What's left is a tableau, an illustration of deflated feelings: Spencer and Daphne sprawled on the floor like stuffed dolls; Spencer and Hilda nude by the fireside, as distorted as any of Otto Dix's quasi-humans. </p> <p>It is hard to understand why Sir Alfred Munnings, president of the Royal Academy, found the Beatitudes so 'saucy' that he had Spencer prosecuted for obscenity in 1950. Even the drawing of Stanley displaying his erection to Hilda in the privy seems too childishly asexual to be depraved. But Spencer was sufficiently alarmed to hide a nude portrait of his future wife, Patricia Preece, beneath a bed for the rest of his days. </p> <p>Spencer left Carline to marry Preece, who duped him of his home and money, returning immediately to her lesbian lover. With her black lingerie, beetle brows and icy expression, she seems the antithesis of Spencer's heaven. Yet his paint quickens, exceptionally, as it inches over her body, recording the forbidden flesh in all its mortal fact, a life class later reprised by Lucian Freud. The more Spencer paints, the longer he keeps Preece with him, no matter how withheld. 'It seems extraordinary,' he wrote, 'to get near her at all.' </p> <p>Spencer was never the isolated outsider of legend. His painting, as the excellent catalogue suggests, absorbs all sorts of lessons: from Gauguin, Nash and Penrose to German realism and Giotto, whose work Spencer studied from first to last. His murals at Burghclere, the greatest of British war memorials, pay homage to Giotto's Arena Chapel in Padua. Everything comes together on these walls: composition, design, the all-inclusiveness of creation. The paint takes on a ghostly transparency, a night vision of the Great War. </p> <p>Tate Britain can't bring Burghclere to London, but it has borrowed some of Spencer's murals from the Second World War, documenting shipyards on the Clyde. Removed from Cookham, surrounded by the reality of other working lives, Spencer's religious beliefs crystallise in his art. Men with blowtorches are hoisted high above the shipyard darkness, like oxyacetalene angels. Welders peer down through their visors, as if seeing the earth below. All are transfigured by a supernatural brightness, resurrected, in Spencer's eyes, by labour and love.</p>",

In The Dustman, he paints Cookham children proffering some garbage - jars, crockery, a wilted cabbage - as sacramental gifts to the dustman who is lightly borne up to heaven in the brawny arms of his wife. The painting is fully as mad as it sounds and pieced together in more fragments than the eye can handle. But it reverses the dust-to-dust rule with its faith in physical redemption - all will be restored, even the decomposing cabbage, in the wondrous hereafter. The image of the puny man and the giant dame is so central to Spencer's art that many people regard this painting as an allegorical self-portrait - Stanley carried by Daphne Charlton, one of the women who sustained him after the death of his second marriage. Spencer was only a little over five feet tall and often made himself seem smaller - a stripling dwarfed and overawed by bolster-bosomed matrons in voluminous garments. You see this over and again in paintings of his first wife, the artist Hilda Carline, who towers above him as they toast crumpets and nearly knocks him over as they choose clothes from an overflowing chest of drawers. Hilda was no bigger than Stanley and her grace and beauty are always evident in his drawings. But something happens in the transformation to canvas - she swells in his memory, distorts in his prodigious fancy. Spencer was a virgin when he married at the age of 34. His expectations must have been considerable, but their fulfilment was a revelation. Resurrection at Cookham, the most famous of all his works, is not just a vision of the dead clambering from their graves - more overcrowded drawers - but an altarpiece to sexual love, aptly displayed above a flight of steps at Tate Britain. The new bride appears not once but three times, worshipped by little Stanley. In the drawings, Hilda is wary and introspective, especially when naked. Here, she lacks all self-consciousness, has become an innocent in Spencer's fantasy of paradise. What did that mean for this unorthodox Methodist? It meant love, if not peace, as people burst through Cookham, parading, hugging, snogging and swooning. Heaven is crude; its inhabitants grapple on the village green, their lust a childish frieze of squinting glances and awkward embraces. At its best, it is a sudden awakening from sleep and the burden of free will. At its worst, as in the caricatural Love Among the Nations, it means Africans with nose-rings and steatopygous buttocks fondling stout matrons, an absurd hybrid of Donald McGill and National Geographic. This is not meant as satire, any more than the unlikely couples in Spencer's Beatitudes from the 1930s, with their buck-teeth, claw hands and bulbous bellies. Spencer, as the early works in this show make clear, was the natural heir to the pre-Raphaelites, his narratives as religious as they were deeply sincere. One of his daughters has said that Spencer painted 'to make things lovable' and this is confirmed in his writings. But there is nothing loving in the paint itself. It is always a shock to see the pictures in reality, instead of reproduction. Spencer squared up in pencil and then applied colour as mechanically as if painting by numbers, the pigment lying sterile and parched on the canvas. His desires, his passions - they seem to die away as he paints. What's left is a tableau, an illustration of deflated feelings: Spencer and Daphne sprawled on the floor like stuffed dolls; Spencer and Hilda nude by the fireside, as distorted as any of Otto Dix's quasi-humans. It is hard to understand why Sir Alfred Munnings, president of the Royal Academy, found the Beatitudes so 'saucy' that he had Spencer prosecuted for obscenity in 1950. Even the drawing of Stanley displaying his erection to Hilda in the privy seems too childishly asexual to be depraved. But Spencer was sufficiently alarmed to hide a nude portrait of his future wife, Patricia Preece, beneath a bed for the rest of his days. Spencer left Carline to marry Preece, who duped him of his home and money, returning immediately to her lesbian lover. With her black lingerie, beetle brows and icy expression, she seems the antithesis of Spencer's heaven. Yet his paint quickens, exceptionally, as it inches over her body, recording the forbidden flesh in all its mortal fact, a life class later reprised by Lucian Freud. The more Spencer paints, the longer he keeps Preece with him, no matter how withheld. 'It seems extraordinary,' he wrote, 'to get near her at all.' Spencer was never the isolated outsider of legend. His painting, as the excellent catalogue suggests, absorbs all sorts of lessons: from Gauguin, Nash and Penrose to German realism and Giotto, whose work Spencer studied from first to last. His murals at Burghclere, the greatest of British war memorials, pay homage to Giotto's Arena Chapel in Padua. Everything comes together on these walls: composition, design, the all-inclusiveness of creation. The paint takes on a ghostly transparency, a night vision of the Great War. Tate Britain can't bring Burghclere to London, but it has borrowed some of Spencer's murals from the Second World War, documenting shipyards on the Clyde. Removed from Cookham, surrounded by the reality of other working lives, Spencer's religious beliefs crystallise in his art. Men with blowtorches are hoisted high above the shipyard darkness, like oxyacetalene angels. Welders peer down through their visors, as if seeing the earth below. All are transfigured by a supernatural brightness, resurrected, in Spencer's eyes, by labour and love.",

      "body": "<b> Boulevard Solitude </b> Royal Opera House, London WC2 <br> <b> Tan Dun premiere </b> LPO, Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 <br> <b> David Bedford premiere </b> AAM, Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford <p> Doom mongers be damned. The Royal Opera's new production of <b>Boulevard Solitude</b> is exemplary. Take courage and cash in both hands and buy a good seat before word gets round (ticket sales have doubled in the past week from 20 per cent to 40 per cent and rising). Henze's 1951 opera, a powerful seven-scene work of ravishing lyricism and subtlety, has hardly been seen in this country since its UK premiere nearly 40 years ago. Not every opera-goer's memory stretches back that far. In truth few of us knew much about it. Is it surprising that advance ticket sales were modest? </p> <p>By some fluke of foresight, the Royal Opera had spotted this potential problem when they agreed to mount a work celebrating the German composer's seventy-fifth birthday (in association with the South Bank's Henze Festival). It wasn't mere chance, though no one seems to have noticed the fact, that box-office hits by Puccini and Rossini have been scheduled in the same season. The ROH, it would appear, does have a perfectly sensible strategy for balancing the books. It's the only way it can expand the repertoire. Otherwise, the place would become the fossil so many who call themselves by that ever-suspect name 'opera lover' would apparently like it to be. </p> <p>The uplifting message from this lavish Nikolaus Lehnhoff production is that no corners have been cut: Tobias Hoheisel's grand, fascist-style marble railway station, all stairs and balconies and pillars looks magnificent and adapts effectively (helped by Paul Pyant's lighting) to Paris attic, boudoir, library and nightclub as required. The movement, particularly the nightmarish toing and froing of commuting humanity, has been beautifully devised by Denni Sayers. </p> <p>Henze and his librettist Grete Weil have drawn heavily on Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost's novel Manon Lescaut (already famously plundered by Puccini and Massenet). Action is updated to the shabby gloom of postwar Paris, with the emphasis now on her lover, the student Armand des Grieux, rather than the fickle Manon herself. He takes cocaine to try to forget her when she abandons him for the wealthy dandy Monsieur Lilaque, whom she eventually murders. Armand's final aria of disillusion, as he watches her taken off to prison, was sung with harrowing blankness by the masterly Swedish tenor, P\u00e4r Lindskog. </p> <p>More remarkable was the soprano Alexandra von der Weth. Quite apart from her soaring, seductive voice and wonderful looks, she brought to the role of Manon a compelling depth offset by film-star glamour. She first appears as early Monroe, convincing even from the front stalls.

      "bodyText": "Boulevard Solitude Royal Opera House, London WC2 Tan Dun premiere LPO, Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 David Bedford premiere AAM, Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford Doom mongers be damned. The Royal Opera's new production of Boulevard Solitude is exemplary. Take courage and cash in both hands and buy a good seat before word gets round (ticket sales have doubled in the past week from 20 per cent to 40 per cent and rising). Henze's 1951 opera, a powerful seven-scene work of ravishing lyricism and subtlety, has hardly been seen in this country since its UK premiere nearly 40 years ago. Not every opera-goer's memory stretches back that far. In truth few of us knew much about it. Is it surprising that advance ticket sales were modest? By some fluke of foresight, the Royal Opera had spotted this potential problem when they agreed to mount a work celebrating the German composer's seventy-fifth birthday (in association with the South Bank's Henze Festival). It wasn't mere chance, though no one seems to have noticed the fact, that box-office hits by Puccini and Rossini have been scheduled in the same season. The ROH, it would appear, does have a perfectly sensible strategy for balancing the books. It's the only way it can expand the repertoire. Otherwise, the place would become the fossil so many who call themselves by that ever-suspect name 'opera lover' would apparently like it to be. The uplifting message from this lavish Nikolaus Lehnhoff production is that no corners have been cut: Tobias Hoheisel's grand, fascist-style marble railway station, all stairs and balconies and pillars looks magnificent and adapts effectively (helped by Paul Pyant's lighting) to Paris attic, boudoir, library and nightclub as required. The movement, particularly the nightmarish toing and froing of commuting humanity, has been beautifully devised by Denni Sayers. Henze and his librettist Grete Weil have drawn heavily on Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost's novel Manon Lescaut (already famously plundered by Puccini and Massenet). Action is updated to the shabby gloom of postwar Paris, with the emphasis now on her lover, the student Armand des Grieux, rather than the fickle Manon herself. He takes cocaine to try to forget her when she abandons him for the wealthy dandy Monsieur Lilaque, whom she eventually murders. Armand's final aria of disillusion, as he watches her taken off to prison, was sung with harrowing blankness by the masterly Swedish tenor, P\u00e4r Lindskog. More remarkable was the soprano Alexandra von der Weth. Quite apart from her soaring, seductive voice and wonderful looks, she brought to the role of Manon a compelling depth offset by film-star glamour. She first appears as early Monroe, convincing even from the front stalls. Wolfgang Rauch as Lescaut, Graeme Broadbent as Lilaque fils and, especially, Chris Merritt as Lilaque p\u00e8re completed the outstanding cast. Henze's score may have struck one Frankfurt critic as 'the sound of nihilism which threatens to spread like the plague' after its 1952 premiere, but then much the same was said about rock 'n' roll and the Beatles. The effortlessly woven fabric of atonality and melody, dry percussive agitation and jazzy allure should frighten no one, even the most culturally nervous.

The former is to display the legs, of which she is proud; the latter is a steel-grey pastiche that must be sculpted by a young man named Victor. 'I once had an insane Uruguayan doing my hair,' she recalls. 'He shaved my eyebrows off, and they have never grown back.' Eye-liner has come from a, '99 cents store'; the hair-spray blows in as a storm from the west.</p> <p>She loves to chat. The voice is deep and rich and upper-class - the fruity tone of a county dowager accustomed to at least three courses served on S\u00e8vres china rather than the voice of one born in a dockland slum in Liverpool. There is no trace of the Scouse, deary me no. She says she was born talking like that, and talk she does - the one-night stand with Michael Hutchence: 'Darling, I had no idea who he was.' The time that she encountered Einstein in a restaurant in Soho: 'I said, \"Why do you keep calling me Madame Butterfly, Mr Epstein...?\"' The hostessing, the three heart attacks, the voyage across the Pacific with a 'bloody' Nazi who punched her in the face. Her life rolls out in dramas of operatic proportions.</p> <p>This is April now. Sixty-five years old and still going for it. She moved to America from Hay-on-Wye in 1986. There were financial problems. She had a huge house that she couldn't afford. 'It was the usual thing. No one would employ me properly, and I didn't want to spend my life on the dole.' New York first, then Los Angeles. Now she rents an apartment in San Diego, or studio as it is more correctly described, as you live in the bedroom. Outside there is a silver Cadillac that she has managed to get up to 150mph. Inside there is feminine clutter and cramped conditions - books, cosmetics, miniature replicas of pictures by Ingres and Van Gogh. A little mattress is on the floor. 'I've had a tranny staying with me.'</p> <p>San Diego is a country club kind of place with trolley tours and whale watching and affordable handicrafts. Streets are divided into neat, palm-lined rows and everything was quiet in the Comfort Inn leisure-dome until that kid shot 15 people in Santee. Her neighbourhood, University Heights, is characterised by Twiggs where coffee is a Hazelnut Buster and entertainment is Melissa Worthington 'singing upbeat folk pop with a positive Christian message'.</p> <p>Her days are spent in a mall in Coronado where clean clapperboard shops have been designed to convey the atmosphere of rustic New England. She works in a 'wildlife' art gallery. The exhibits are alabaster wolf heads, poison toads made of glass and swans carved out of Douglas fir. It is quite stressful, as she has to sell $1,000 worth of wolves and swans a day. But there are good moments. She likes telling the children interesting things about cheetahs and 'the other day a man came into the gallery and said to me, \"What is it like to be extraordinarily beautiful?\" Things like that blow you away because all you're thinking is, \"I've got another four hours to go, my feet are killing me, shall I take another pill to stop the cramps in my legs...?\"'</p> <p>She has friends in the mall. 'They think I'm a bit eccentric because I tell the truth. I tell their bosses what shits they are and they find that stunning because they are very politically correct and I am very politically incorrect.'</p> <p>The friends in the mall don't know that she was once a man, though she would tell them if they asked her. She makes no effort to hide herself. 'I'm always in the directory. I think if the Queen can be in the telephone book, so can I.' In England, though, the name April Ashley is still imbued with resonance. She was one of the first, after all. And people remember that.</p> <p>Her 1982 autobiography, April Ashley's Odyssey opens to find her, 'toying with truffles', and closes with her going to a hunt ball, 'dressed as Artemis of Ephesus'. And in between? She was born George Jamieson in 1935; father Frederick was a cook in the navy; mother Ada worked in a bomb factory. At the age of 15, George knew he wanted to be a girl, but joined the Merchant Navy instead. It was not a success.There was a suicide attempt at 18, electroconvulsive therapy and misery. Fifties Paris provided a solution; it was Simone and Sartre \u00e0 gogo, and George joined a cabaret.</p> <p>In May 1960, at the age of 24, Jamieson presented himself at Dr Burou's 'clinique' in Casablanca and underwent an operation to change his sex. It was painful, but effective; it removed the penis that she did not want and provided her with the ability to have an internal orgasm. 'I was lucky. I had spontaneous breast growth.' A genuine beauty of classic stature, she passed. The old pictures of Ms Ashley modelling Thea Porter would cause anyone to wonder if Naomi Campbell could once have been a boy scout.</p> <p>The 60s was, by and large, most enjoyable. She was photographed by Bailey, hung out with Peter O'Toole (who hit people who made fun of her), partied with Oxford undergraduates who adored her and slept with a lot of lords. 'I was in seventh heaven.'</p> <p>One admirer introduced himself as Frank which turned out to be neither his name or an accurate description. He was, in fact, the Honorable Arthur Cameron Corbett, first son of Lord Rowallan, a former Governor General of Tasmania. Arthur was heir to a Victorian castle and 7,000 acres in Scotland. Over lunches at the Caprice, he told April that his marriage was under some strain because he was compelled to dress up as a lady, which, at that point in time, was not as Eddie Izzard-fashionable as it is now. Arthur Corbett's affair with April Ashley initiated a scandal whose historical context will be aired in an ITV series this month entitled, Time of our Lives , which traces the story of the Rowallan family as part of a documentary about the progress of post-war Britain.</p> <p>When Arthur Corbett's affair with April Ashley became public, his furious father (a puritanical Presbyterian) disinherited him. 'Arthur Corbett had sacrificed everything for April Ashley,' says the programme's voice-over 'but only two weeks after the marriage, she packed her bags and left.'</p> <p>And here is April, in front of the ITV camera, wearing a California tan, creamy pearls and a look of enigmatic satisfaction that may be the chosen expression of one who once had three rows of teeth as a child and is aware that dentition is not her best feature.</p> <p>'I ran off with the heir to the Duke del Infantados,' she says with shameless insouciance. 'We ran off to Sevilla to the palace of the duke. We made love under the Goyas and Velazquez. It was wonderful...'</p> <p>A scarlet woman? A pot hunter even. The story of the romance unfolds as black-and-white footage, interviews with disapproving Corbetts, and Ian Holm (the narrator) announcing in a mournful telly-tone that the 'story is a tragic one'.</p> <p>April again. To camera. 'He [Arthur] would say, \"You are going to be the most beautiful Lady Rowallan that ever there was,\" and I'd say, \"Yes, Arthur, but where's the castle?\" Johnnie Corbett, the current Lord Rowallan, was most displeased by Ms Ashley's inclusion in the programme. Arthur Corbett's son and heir was at Eton when his father left his mother for what many viewed as a horrifying (and arriviste) she-male mutant. In 1962, April sold her story to the News of the World . These surreal scenarios must have been both wounding and inexplicable. The world jeered. The little boy had had polio. It can't have been easy.</p> <p>Johnnie inherited the title at the age of 46. His grandfather, however, had rewritten his will at the last moment and, rather than inheriting the estate in entirety, as he had expected, Corbett found that the property had been divided up between all the children and grandchildren. No one person could afford to buy the others out and, subsumed by mounting bills, Corbett spent the next 20 years fighting to keep the heirloom intact. He lost the battle and, in the late 80s, the estate and its contents were sold.</p> <p>'You have to remember,' Ms Ashley tells me,' I was 25 and Arthur was 42. He was very sophisticated, and he was a liar. I was working class and I didn't know much about life.'</p> <p>It is evening. A Chinese take-away has been delivered to the candle-lit kitchenette and is being forked out of its containers with great majesty. Ms Ashley is grand but comfortable in lilac silk loungewear. Mitigating circumstances are outlined over stir-fry prawns and a tumbler of vodka and Fresca.</p> <p>'He was two people,' she says. 'A man and a woman. I used to call the woman She. The legs would be crossed in a very exaggerated way, the way he held his cigarette would change, the voice would become slightly higher pitched. He didn't know when it was going to happen. She arrived daily. She was a very nasty woman and would call me a prostitute. I would say, \"Arthur, look, if it would ease this pressure between us and it would stop you behaving in this appalling way, why don't you put a dress on and get it over and done with?\" He wouldn't go to bed with me, by the way. Anyway, he called me a whore once too often, and I left with seven suitcases and the Great Dane.'</p> <p>Arthur Corbett did not resent losing his fortune, she says, though his feelings towards her were more akin to obsession than love. Her friends saw her betrothal as a cold act of self-advancement, but married they were, in Gibralter in 1963, and separated soon afterwards when Arthur's hopes of erotic fulfilment dissolved. He had seen her as a way of resolving the torment of his inner conflicts, but cold reality killed this fantasy.</p> <p>April felt that she had helped the Jacaranda, his Marbella night-club, become the 'howling' success that it was. 'Darling, they came to see me. They didn't come to see him.' Feeling that she was entitled to alimony, she pressed to keep the Spanish villa that Corbett had promised her. His response was to sue for an annulment of the marriage on the grounds that she was 'a person of the male sex'. He won the case, and April had a nervous breakdown.</p> <p>The proceedings, long and laborious, were invasionary both physically and emotionally. There was much medical testimony about her 'artificial vagina', created using parts of the scrotum and lined with skin to make it moist; there was evidence about her internal abscesses (making it difficult to achieve penetration) as well as details of Corbett's premature ejaculation and consequent hysteria.</p> <p>The case confirmed her worst fears; in the view of society, she was not a real woman and never would be, legally, socially or biologically. She was a freak.</p> <p>Why did she agree to be interviewed for the television series, I wonder? 'Well, darling, because I was asked and because I have never been afraid of the truth.'</p> <p>Nowadays, life is quieter. She likes to go to the opera with Zandra Rhodes. Der Rosenkavalier is her favourite. The wrinkles have arrived and she is trying to persuade her best friend Peter to pay for a face-lift. 'But he just says, \"Fuck off.\"'</p> <p>Last year, she began to have problems with high blood pressure, which arrived at about the same time as the news that most of her brothers and sisters had died. Roddy, Theresa, Marjorie, Ivor - all gone. There was a telephone call in the middle of the night... 'It upset me because I didn't have the formality of saying goodbye, and I think I had hung on to hopes of a reconciliation. It was a terrible family. My mother had a lot to answer for.'</p> <p>April's mother was a strange and cruel woman who slapped her sensitive son in the face and beat him with a belt daily because he wet the bed. 'I had a hole in my back long before you heard the expression child-abuse. A doctor looked at it and said: \"If you ever touch that child again, I will have you arrested.\"'</p> <p>She liked her father. 'He was a terrible old drunk, and I am afraid we all became drunks, but he was never cruel to anybody. He was the first man I ever heard call another man 'darling'. This was the 40s, and it was unheard of. 'Yes, darling, would you like a pint darling?' And he had the most extraordinary tastes. I mean we lived in the poorest part of town, but he adored mushrooms very gently heated in cream.'</p> <p>The evenings are usually spent with Lily the (male) cat. She claims that she is a recluse because 'every time I go out somebody tries to pick me up...' She used to force herself to go to the Shakespeare pub, particularly when she was depressed and penniless.</p> <p>'The last time I slept with a man was ooh... [long pause] about five or six years ago. I was sitting in the bar getting a little squiffy and suddenly this man comes up to me, about 40, and so good-looking. He said, \"Can I buy you a drink?\"' And I said, \"Sure.\" Because... you know... I'm sure you've done it. Then he said, \"I'm falling in love...\" I said, \"What!\" He said, \"I'm falling in love - that voice! Has anyone told you that you are beautiful?\" I said, \"Yes, many years ago...\" I just happened to have a bottle of champagne at home, but it was awful because he was so drunk. The next morning, he said, \"Would you drive me home?\" And I said, \"Would you mind terribly walking? I've got to go sailing.\"'</p> <p>Correspondence arrives care of a purple iMac because now there is aprilashley.com, and people email her from all over the world. Some have criticised her for failing to involve herself with political transgender issues and, though she knew about Boys Don't Cry (in which Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her performance as a biological girl attempting to live a normal life as a boy), she was unaware of that week's Los Angeles Times where on the front page, the 'era of the gender crosser' was being heralded in an environment where the 'transgender community has found a voice', thanks to gay liberation, medical advances and the dissemination of a more sophisticated understanding.</p> <p>As feminists have long argued that anatomy is not destiny, so the new purveyors of transgender activism are the logical outcome of the sexual-identity movement, and they are being heard. The city of West Hollywood (a gay community in LA) recently hired a task force of seven people to study the needs of the growing transgender population, while the film company Fine Line has produced a big budget movie about identity crisis called Hedwig and the Angry Inch .</p> <p>Gender dysphoria is no longer a crime. Things have come a long way since Dr Burou and his clinique. April Ashley has lived her life as an extraordinary person, and while the celebrity has often damned her, it has also helped her to survive.</p> <p>Her activism takes the form of personal concerns, such as fighting for a pension from the English authorities, money to which she believes she is entitled since she has been working since she was 10-years-old.</p> <p>'I am not a political,' she says.' I worked for Greenpeace, but I have only voted twice in my life, which is naughty of me perhaps, but I thought the best way I could do it was by example. I wasn't about to live in a twilight world. I wanted to live in the real world and do what everybody else does. I think I have lived my life with enormous dignity.'</p> <p>So now it is about appreciating things and retaining the sunny disposition that she was lucky enough to be born with. 'People sometimes make me out to be sad,' she says. 'But actually I am rather jolly. An embittered old woman is no good to anybody.'</p> <p>Certainly, she is good at having a nice time. To spend the day with her is to appreciate a diva who will slip into a tiara and a ball gown simply because it is fun. She knows how to have a laugh and is correct to think that you will be amused to hear that she once spent the night with Omar Sharif and he had no idea about her background.</p> <p>It has been a fabulous biography and one which surely is a movie. Who should play her I wonder? 'Well there is only one person,' she says immediately, because she has thought about it. And who is that? 'Well, darling, it has to be Catherine Zeta-Jones.'</p> <p>\u0095 Time of our Lives is on ITV at 10.20pm tomorrow evening.</p>",

At the age of 15, George knew he wanted to be a girl, but joined the Merchant Navy instead. It was not a success.There was a suicide attempt at 18, electroconvulsive therapy and misery. Fifties Paris provided a solution; it was Simone and Sartre \u00e0 gogo, and George joined a cabaret. In May 1960, at the age of 24, Jamieson presented himself at Dr Burou's 'clinique' in Casablanca and underwent an operation to change his sex. It was painful, but effective; it removed the penis that she did not want and provided her with the ability to have an internal orgasm. 'I was lucky. I had spontaneous breast growth.' A genuine beauty of classic stature, she passed. The old pictures of Ms Ashley modelling Thea Porter would cause anyone to wonder if Naomi Campbell could once have been a boy scout. The 60s was, by and large, most enjoyable. She was photographed by Bailey, hung out with Peter O'Toole (who hit people who made fun of her), partied with Oxford undergraduates who adored her and slept with a lot of lords. 'I was in seventh heaven.' One admirer introduced himself as Frank which turned out to be neither his name or an accurate description. He was, in fact, the Honorable Arthur Cameron Corbett, first son of Lord Rowallan, a former Governor General of Tasmania. Arthur was heir to a Victorian castle and 7,000 acres in Scotland. Over lunches at the Caprice, he told April that his marriage was under some strain because he was compelled to dress up as a lady, which, at that point in time, was not as Eddie Izzard-fashionable as it is now. Arthur Corbett's affair with April Ashley initiated a scandal whose historical context will be aired in an ITV series this month entitled, Time of our Lives , which traces the story of the Rowallan family as part of a documentary about the progress of post-war Britain. When Arthur Corbett's affair with April Ashley became public, his furious father (a puritanical Presbyterian) disinherited him. 'Arthur Corbett had sacrificed everything for April Ashley,' says the programme's voice-over 'but only two weeks after the marriage, she packed her bags and left.' And here is April, in front of the ITV camera, wearing a California tan, creamy pearls and a look of enigmatic satisfaction that may be the chosen expression of one who once had three rows of teeth as a child and is aware that dentition is not her best feature. 'I ran off with the heir to the Duke del Infantados,' she says with shameless insouciance. 'We ran off to Sevilla to the palace of the duke. We made love under the Goyas and Velazquez. It was wonderful...' A scarlet woman? A pot hunter even. The story of the romance unfolds as black-and-white footage, interviews with disapproving Corbetts, and Ian Holm (the narrator) announcing in a mournful telly-tone that the 'story is a tragic one'. April again. To camera. 'He [Arthur] would say, \"You are going to be the most beautiful Lady Rowallan that ever there was,\" and I'd say, \"Yes, Arthur, but where's the castle?\" Johnnie Corbett, the current Lord Rowallan, was most displeased by Ms Ashley's inclusion in the programme. Arthur Corbett's son and heir was at Eton when his father left his mother for what many viewed as a horrifying (and arriviste) she-male mutant. In 1962, April sold her story to the News of the World . These surreal scenarios must have been both wounding and inexplicable. The world jeered. The little boy had had polio. It can't have been easy. Johnnie inherited the title at the age of 46. His grandfather, however, had rewritten his will at the last moment and, rather than inheriting the estate in entirety, as he had expected, Corbett found that the property had been divided up between all the children and grandchildren. No one person could afford to buy the others out and, subsumed by mounting bills, Corbett spent the next 20 years fighting to keep the heirloom intact. He lost the battle and, in the late 80s, the estate and its contents were sold. 'You have to remember,' Ms Ashley tells me,' I was 25 and Arthur was 42. He was very sophisticated, and he was a liar. I was working class and I didn't know much about life.' It is evening. A Chinese take-away has been delivered to the candle-lit kitchenette and is being forked out of its containers with great majesty. Ms Ashley is grand but comfortable in lilac silk loungewear. Mitigating circumstances are outlined over stir-fry prawns and a tumbler of vodka and Fresca. 'He was two people,' she says. 'A man and a woman. I used to call the woman She. The legs would be crossed in a very exaggerated way, the way he held his cigarette would change, the voice would become slightly higher pitched. He didn't know when it was going to happen. She arrived daily. She was a very nasty woman and would call me a prostitute. I would say, \"Arthur, look, if it would ease this pressure between us and it would stop you behaving in this appalling way, why don't you put a dress on and get it over and done with?\" He wouldn't go to bed with me, by the way. Anyway, he called me a whore once too often, and I left with seven suitcases and the Great Dane.' Arthur Corbett did not resent losing his fortune, she says, though his feelings towards her were more akin to obsession than love. Her friends saw her betrothal as a cold act of self-advancement, but married they were, in Gibralter in 1963, and separated soon afterwards when Arthur's hopes of erotic fulfilment dissolved. He had seen her as a way of resolving the torment of his inner conflicts, but cold reality killed this fantasy. April felt that she had helped the Jacaranda, his Marbella night-club, become the 'howling' success that it was. 'Darling, they came to see me. They didn't come to see him.' Feeling that she was entitled to alimony, she pressed to keep the Spanish villa that Corbett had promised her. His response was to sue for an annulment of the marriage on the grounds that she was 'a person of the male sex'. He won the case, and April had a nervous breakdown. The proceedings, long and laborious, were invasionary both physically and emotionally. There was much medical testimony about her 'artificial vagina', created using parts of the scrotum and lined with skin to make it moist; there was evidence about her internal abscesses (making it difficult to achieve penetration) as well as details of Corbett's premature ejaculation and consequent hysteria. The case confirmed her worst fears; in the view of society, she was not a real woman and never would be, legally, socially or biologically. She was a freak. Why did she agree to be interviewed for the television series, I wonder? 'Well, darling, because I was asked and because I have never been afraid of the truth.' Nowadays, life is quieter. She likes to go to the opera with Zandra Rhodes. Der Rosenkavalier is her favourite. The wrinkles have arrived and she is trying to persuade her best friend Peter to pay for a face-lift. 'But he just says, \"Fuck off.\"' Last year, she began to have problems with high blood pressure, which arrived at about the same time as the news that most of her brothers and sisters had died. Roddy, Theresa, Marjorie, Ivor - all gone. There was a telephone call in the middle of the night... 'It upset me because I didn't have the formality of saying goodbye, and I think I had hung on to hopes of a reconciliation. It was a terrible family. My mother had a lot to answer for.' April's mother was a strange and cruel woman who slapped her sensitive son in the face and beat him with a belt daily because he wet the bed. 'I had a hole in my back long before you heard the expression child-abuse. A doctor looked at it and said: \"If you ever touch that child again, I will have you arrested.\"' She liked her father. 'He was a terrible old drunk, and I am afraid we all became drunks, but he was never cruel to anybody. He was the first man I ever heard call another man 'darling'. This was the 40s, and it was unheard of. 'Yes, darling, would you like a pint darling?' And he had the most extraordinary tastes. I mean we lived in the poorest part of town, but he adored mushrooms very gently heated in cream.' The evenings are usually spent with Lily the (male) cat. She claims that she is a recluse because 'every time I go out somebody tries to pick me up...' She used to force herself to go to the Shakespeare pub, particularly when she was depressed and penniless. 'The last time I slept with a man was ooh... [long pause] about five or six years ago. I was sitting in the bar getting a little squiffy and suddenly this man comes up to me, about 40, and so good-looking. He said, \"Can I buy you a drink?\"' And I said, \"Sure.\" Because... you know... I'm sure you've done it. Then he said, \"I'm falling in love...\" I said, \"What!\" He said, \"I'm falling in love - that voice! Has anyone told you that you are beautiful?\" I said, \"Yes, many years ago...\" I just happened to have a bottle of champagne at home, but it was awful because he was so drunk. The next morning, he said, \"Would you drive me home?\" And I said, \"Would you mind terribly walking? I've got to go sailing.\"' Correspondence arrives care of a purple iMac because now there is aprilashley.com, and people email her from all over the world. Some have criticised her for failing to involve herself with political transgender issues and, though she knew about Boys Don't Cry (in which Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her performance as a biological girl attempting to live a normal life as a boy), she was unaware of that week's Los Angeles Times where on the front page, the 'era of the gender crosser' was being heralded in an environment where the 'transgender community has found a voice', thanks to gay liberation, medical advances and the dissemination of a more sophisticated understanding. As feminists have long argued that anatomy is not destiny, so the new purveyors of transgender activism are the logical outcome of the sexual-identity movement, and they are being heard. The city of West Hollywood (a gay community in LA) recently hired a task force of seven people to study the needs of the growing transgender population, while the film company Fine Line has produced a big budget movie about identity crisis called Hedwig and the Angry Inch . Gender dysphoria is no longer a crime. Things have come a long way since Dr Burou and his clinique. April Ashley has lived her life as an extraordinary person, and while the celebrity has often damned her, it has also helped her to survive. Her activism takes the form of personal concerns, such as fighting for a pension from the English authorities, money to which she believes she is entitled since she has been working since she was 10-years-old. 'I am not a political,' she says.' I worked for Greenpeace, but I have only voted twice in my life, which is naughty of me perhaps, but I thought the best way I could do it was by example. I wasn't about to live in a twilight world. I wanted to live in the real world and do what everybody else does. I think I have lived my life with enormous dignity.' So now it is about appreciating things and retaining the sunny disposition that she was lucky enough to be born with. 'People sometimes make me out to be sad,' she says. 'But actually I am rather jolly. An embittered old woman is no good to anybody.' Certainly, she is good at having a nice time. To spend the day with her is to appreciate a diva who will slip into a tiara and a ball gown simply because it is fun. She knows how to have a laugh and is correct to think that you will be amused to hear that she once spent the night with Omar Sharif and he had no idea about her background. It has been a fabulous biography and one which surely is a movie. Who should play her I wonder? 'Well there is only one person,' she says immediately, because she has thought about it. And who is that? 'Well, darling, it has to be Catherine Zeta-Jones.' \u0095 Time of our Lives is on ITV at 10.20pm tomorrow evening.",

      "body": "<p>As a teenager living in Buckie, in the north-east of Scotland, Avril Mair didn't have a TV and the nearest Marks &amp; Spencer's was a three-hour drive away. But from around the age of 14, she had access to her own little underground club. Here, the regulars dressed up in outfits that were made by wrapping brightly printed fabric round their body, with bleached hair and peacock-coloured eye shadow, or gold-lam\u00e9 frilly shirts, dozens of jumble-sale necklaces and a permanent scowl on their glossy red lips. There were drag queens with glitter lips and peroxide hair, and rockers in smelly leather. There were boys with too much powder on their pretty faces, and girls in fluorescent-coloured socks and DM boots. </p> <p>It was 1985, and Mair became a voyeur, surveying the club scene and the fashion poseurs of London, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle. Once a month, she bought i-D and soaked up the ideas, the people, the music and the madness. ' i-D was the only magazine that connected me to the world outside,' she says. 'I bought it religiously. I always wanted to work for it.' At Edinburgh University, she began writing club reviews for i-D , after her work was spotted in the Scottish listings magazine The List . In 1992, she was offered a job. It was the first time she had ever been to London. </p> <p>Avril Mair's is a typical i-D story. And there are many others like her. They didn't all end up editing the magazine, as she now does (although most contributors started off as fans). But before i-D and The Face , style magazines didn't exist. Awkward teenagers from Scunthorpe to Southampton didn't have a place where they could relate to each other and realise they weren't the only ones to let the world know they were different by dyeing their hair and wearing wacky outfits made out of old curtains from the local Oxfam shop. i-D became a club that anyone with \u00a31 could join. </p> <p>The 'worldwide manual of style', as it called itself, with the winking front covers and the illegible, DIY graphics, celebrates its 21st birthday this week, with a book, SMILE i-D , published by Taschen, and an exhibition of photographs by contributors including Steve Johnston, Corinne Day, Nick Knight, Juergen Teller and Turner-prize winner, Wolfgang Tillmans, at the Wapping Hydraulic Power Station in east London. </p> <p>The magazine was launched in 1980 by ex- Vogue art director Terry Jones. 'Steve Johnston was a student from somewhere in Scotland,' he recalls, 'and he came to me at Vogue with all these landscapes because he wanted to be an art photographer. I just said he was wasting his time, and if I was his age I'd be documenting what was going on on the street. So he came back three months later, and I was with the editor, Bea Miller, when she saw this guy with orange hair, a swastika on his forehead, and dog collar. He'd transformed himself from being the quiet lad, but he was exactly the same.' </p> <p>It became quickly apparent that Johnston and Jones needed another outlet. Vogue was not the place. So Jones put together a book, called Not Another Punk Book , made like a Ladybird children's guide to punk, really simply laid out, with blown-up typewriter type. 'That was the start of the head-to-toe portrait,' says Jones. It was also the seed for i-D , a magazine that would feature 'straight-ups' - photos which literally documented people on the streets, from top to toe. </p> <p>'It was a gathering of like-minded people,' says Jones. It began as a quarterly - a fashion fanzine - and was put together in the attic of the north-London house Jones shared with his wife Tricia. But right from the start, it had an unmistakable identity. 'The idea of the wink was as a hidden eye, because it was about going inside, beyond the surface.' As Dylan Jones, who was editor from 1984-7, writes in the introduction to Smile i-D : 'When it launched, i-D didn't look like any other magazine on the shelves, and in many respects still doesn't. Turned on its side, the i-D logo resembles a wink and a smile, and every cover has featured a winking, smiling face; a theme that has given the magazine an iconic identity as strong as that developed by Playboy in the 50s [which always included a bunny silhouette somewhere on its cover].' </p> <p>While Tricia cooked pasta for the endless stream of photographers, writers and designers who made the magazine, Jones set about playing with typefaces, cropping and layering, playing with the pictures in the same way the art students and wannabe pop stars in the 'straight-ups' had irreverently customised their jumble-sale clothes. 'It was a cross between a youth club and community service,' recalls Alix Sharkey, whose then girlfriend, Moira Bogue, was Jones's first design assistant. 'I never wanted to be a journalist. I thought I was going to be a pop star.' </p> <p>But he liked writing, gained a bit of a reputation for writing students' theses for them and soon got roped into writing stories for i-D . His first assignment was to interview a Japanese toy robot. His second was to interview the godfather of soul, James Brown. 'Terry Jones saved my life,' says Sharkey, who is still listed as a contributing editor. 'If it wasn't for him, I'd now be a 44-year-old, ex-pop star. Or if I'd become a successful pop star, I would have pushed everything so hard, I'd have killed myself.' </p> <p>In the early days, Jones put i-D together by night. 'It took over the house eventually,' he says. Photographers were allowed only two shots when they went out on the streets, mainly for reasons of budget. But it all helped to give the magazine a certain freshness and spontaneity. The first few issues were stapled along the narrow edge, so that the magazine opened out wide. While i-D nurtured inexperienced young writers such as Kathryn Flett, and Caryn Franklin, who edited the magazine before becoming a TV presenter for the Clothes Show , Jones also had a habit of picking up talented young photographers. Jones gave the young photography student Nick Knight his first commission: to photograph people in Bournemouth. </p> <p>In April 1983, Knight photographed a young singer, Sade Adu, for the cover of the All Star issue. Her first single wasn't released until the following January. She was so unknown there was even a tip on how to pronounce her name ('Sharday Ahdoo'). The next issue, i-D did it again, with an obscure young performer called Madonna, who had just flown over from New York. 'Nobody knew who she was,' says Jones. It was the Sex Sense issue, and newsagents insisted it went on the top shelf, because of its gratuitous use of the word 'sex'. Jones tells the story that Madonna had problems winking with her right eye, so she used her left one, and Jones flipped the picture. It didn't matter, because everyone thought the picture was of Boy George's pretty young side kick, Marilyn. </p> <p>'The first photographers got paid in magazines,' says Jones. 'I'd paid for the film - 36 shots - that meant at least 16 portraits. Wolfgang Tillmans started just that way. He'd gone to Bournemouth because he'd been inspired by i-D and then discovered Nick had been there.' He offered his services the week he enrolled at college. The fashion editor-at-large Edward Enninful, first appeared in i-D in 1989, modelling for Nick Knight. He became fashion editor in 1991 at the age of 17. He has gone on to become one of the fashion world's most influential stylists, working on campaigns for design houses from Calvin Klein to Armani. </p> <p>Eleven years ago I, too, found myself in the offices of the magazine. As a teenager in Liverpool, I remember buying it from a vintage clothes shop called 69A, along with my 50s stilettoes and neon-green ski pants. And now I had been offered work experience, assisting the then fashion editor Beth Summers. I was terrified. Beth looked at me witheringly and said, 'I wasn't expecting you.' I wanted the ground to eat me up. She gave me a story to write about a recent fashion graduate. And I sat blushing at my desk, as though I was at school, wrote the story, too terrified to look round this rickety old Covent Garden office, filled with bleary-eyed bright young things who drifted in as the day progressed. It was all too cool. And I was too pathetic. The next day, I decided not to go back. 'They won't even notice I'm not there,' I thought. And then I got a call from the editor Matthew Collin, wanting to know where I was. 'Beth was worried about you,' he said. I felt even more mortified, and too embarrassed to return. Imagine my amazement when I bought the next issue of i-D and my story was there. It was only small, but underneath was my first-ever byline. </p> <p>Now celebrating its 21st birthday, i-D has come of age. When I ask Jones if it has made him rich, he looks puzzled. 'In life?' he asks. 'Or do you mean financially? I think it's rich in life. People say it's part of the establishment now. Yes, we're definitely part of the establishment. When you've been around for 20 years, you're established. The interesting part of it is that we should continue to inspire. If you have your eyes open, you're the right person to read i-D . Open eyes, open mind. Everyone got stuck with the idea that it was about youth. And it's never been about youth - it's always been about attitude.' And then his face breaks into a cheeky grin and he throws me the quickest, cheekiest, most fleeting of winks.</p> <p>\u0095 The SMILE i-D exhibition, in association with Emporio Armani, is at The Wapping Project, Wapping Hydraulic Power Station, Wapping Wall, London E1 (020 7680 2080) from 30 March to 29 April (admission free); closed Mondays.

It was all too cool. And I was too pathetic. The next day, I decided not to go back. 'They won't even notice I'm not there,' I thought. And then I got a call from the editor Matthew Collin, wanting to know where I was. 'Beth was worried about you,' he said. I felt even more mortified, and too embarrassed to return. Imagine my amazement when I bought the next issue of i-D and my story was there. It was only small, but underneath was my first-ever byline. Now celebrating its 21st birthday, i-D has come of age. When I ask Jones if it has made him rich, he looks puzzled. 'In life?' he asks. 'Or do you mean financially? I think it's rich in life. People say it's part of the establishment now. Yes, we're definitely part of the establishment. When you've been around for 20 years, you're established. The interesting part of it is that we should continue to inspire. If you have your eyes open, you're the right person to read i-D . Open eyes, open mind. Everyone got stuck with the idea that it was about youth. And it's never been about youth - it's always been about attitude.' And then his face breaks into a cheeky grin and he throws me the quickest, cheekiest, most fleeting of winks. \u0095 The SMILE i-D exhibition, in association with Emporio Armani, is at The Wapping Project, Wapping Hydraulic Power Station, Wapping Wall, London E1 (020 7680 2080) from 30 March to 29 April (admission free); closed Mondays. SMILE i-D - The Best from 20 Years of i-D, edited by Terry Jones (\u00a319.99, Taschen), is out now.",

      "body": "<p>Driving to the park the other morning to take Walter (the spiritually enlightened dog) for his morning air, I found myself caught in unexpected gridlock. In every direction, as far as the eye could see, were four-wheeled people carriers.</p> <p>Walter, who is no small beast, getting restless in the back, jumped into the front passenger seat. He looked at me pragmatically for a moment as if to suggest I let him out for a pee in light of our obstructed position. 'No, dude, you know you went nuts last time I did that and ran amok among the traffic, peeing on the wheel of that Mercedes. You'll just have to hold it. Won't be long now.'</p> <p>But he wasn't having any. He started that whining, whimpering sound he makes which, coming from such a large and magnificent animal, is guaranteed to melt your resolve every time. I held firm. 'Walter,' I commenced negotiations. 'We're going to chant to calm ourselves down.' Now, Walter is no stranger to the exotic vocal traditions of the east. Heaven knows, there are many who swear he's the reincarnation of an ancient Hindu sage. In fact, if I hit a low F sharp, he will invariably join me in a duet, howling along in tune.</p> <p>So I took a deep breath in, letting my ribcage expand laterally, and chanted 'Namu Amida Bhutsu!' ('Hello and welcome, Buddha of Compassion!'), repeatedly until I hit that F# and Walter kicked in with his holy howling. After some moments of this extraordinary behaviour from the two of us, causing people to peer curiously through windscreens - and I can't talk for Walter on this, but it felt like we were sharing the experience - I found myself having somehow transcended the realms of relativity. Right or wrong, good driving or bad, I was now enjoying the perspective of none other than the Compassionate Buddha him (or her) self.</p> <p>In that moment, everything was perfect exactly as it was. Everyone was simply doing the very best they could at this moment in the world's evolution. We were all just children in the playground playing traffic jams.</p> <p>And this was exactly where Walter and I were meant to be. Walter howled along without a whimper till our compassion caused the gridlock to clear and we made it to the park in time for him to explode out of the door and disappear into the distance at 80mph in a frenzied dash for relief.</p> <p>In fact, the sensation of compassion for humankind lasted throughout the day - so much so, I felt I would risk ridicule by disclosing these rather personal details about my relationship with Walter and the spiritual moments we often enjoy together to share with you a little of the wonders of chanting. Chanting has been used as a self-entrancing device by Eastern and Western spiritual paths for as long as any boddisatva round here can remember. From repeating Hail Marys to hailing Ganesh the Hindu elephant god, we have always used vocal sound to instigate an altered state of mind, one that transcends local concerns and sees beyond the world of distinctions to the perfection within (it and oneself).</p> <p>In a way, it wouldn't matter what sound you repeated: the actual vibrations would engender physical comfort and relaxation from within, like an internally applied sonic massage. However, I must report from personal experience that there is an essence carried in these sacred chants of East and West, passed down by disciples and holy ones through the ages, which seems to affect you more profoundly than would, say, chanting, 'Roll me out into the marketplace' or other such nonsense.</p> <p>But more importantly, and this is the deep purpose of all the 'om' chanting, there is an a priori sound - the very sound of creation. It's the one referred to in the opening lines of the bible: 'God spoke, and said let there be light' (excuse me waxing so, but it is Sunday). The yogis refer to this sound as 'shabd', which, if one trains oneself to listen out for it in deepest meditation, will confer on one a profound sense of peace and wellbeing. All the omming and ahhing is just an attempt to mimic that original sound in order to set up a field of resonance. Try it now, if it doesn't feel too exotic for comfort. Take a full inbreath, allowing your ribcage to expand laterally and gently allow to escape from deep within your belly the sound 'AUM!', stretching out the 'AU' as long as possible before closing your lips for the final 'M'. If you find that vaguely relaxing, try repeating it for up to nine breaths' worth. Then rest for a moment or two in the inner silence and see if you can hear (or hear if you can see) the original sound of creation for yourself.</p> <p><b>Your questions</b></p> <p>Dear Barefoot Doctor, Although I eat well and drink lots of water, I suffer from excess oily skin. My skin has been like this since my early teens and I'm used to it but now, at 25, my skin scars more easily from spots and I always have blackheads around my nose and chin that seem raised. Conventional medication fails to help.<br><b>Nick, via email</b></p> <p>It sounds as if your liver and spleen energies are unbalanced, causing stomach heat to errantly rise along the meridian to the oral region. This was probably caused initially by a wobble in the kidney energy around puberty (kidney energy controls hormonal transitions but also supports the liver and spleen). As well as trying the biochemical tissue salts version of silica (not the homeopathic version) - four every (waking) hour for a few days - massage with palms briskly across the upper abdomen 81 times from left to right and then repeat from right to left, morning and evening, indefinitely. This is known as harmonising liver and spleen and is generally good for health and stamina, but will help to settle the stomach heat. Also try cleansing the region with witch hazel.</p> <p>Dear Barefoot, I have lots of tiny growths on my neck. My GP has said it's a very common and harmless condition.

      "bodyText": "Driving to the park the other morning to take Walter (the spiritually enlightened dog) for his morning air, I found myself caught in unexpected gridlock. In every direction, as far as the eye could see, were four-wheeled people carriers. Walter, who is no small beast, getting restless in the back, jumped into the front passenger seat. He looked at me pragmatically for a moment as if to suggest I let him out for a pee in light of our obstructed position. 'No, dude, you know you went nuts last time I did that and ran amok among the traffic, peeing on the wheel of that Mercedes. You'll just have to hold it. Won't be long now.' But he wasn't having any. He started that whining, whimpering sound he makes which, coming from such a large and magnificent animal, is guaranteed to melt your resolve every time. I held firm. 'Walter,' I commenced negotiations. 'We're going to chant to calm ourselves down.' Now, Walter is no stranger to the exotic vocal traditions of the east. Heaven knows, there are many who swear he's the reincarnation of an ancient Hindu sage. In fact, if I hit a low F sharp, he will invariably join me in a duet, howling along in tune. So I took a deep breath in, letting my ribcage expand laterally, and chanted 'Namu Amida Bhutsu!' ('Hello and welcome, Buddha of Compassion!'), repeatedly until I hit that F# and Walter kicked in with his holy howling. After some moments of this extraordinary behaviour from the two of us, causing people to peer curiously through windscreens - and I can't talk for Walter on this, but it felt like we were sharing the experience - I found myself having somehow transcended the realms of relativity. Right or wrong, good driving or bad, I was now enjoying the perspective of none other than the Compassionate Buddha him (or her) self. In that moment, everything was perfect exactly as it was. Everyone was simply doing the very best they could at this moment in the world's evolution. We were all just children in the playground playing traffic jams. And this was exactly where Walter and I were meant to be. Walter howled along without a whimper till our compassion caused the gridlock to clear and we made it to the park in time for him to explode out of the door and disappear into the distance at 80mph in a frenzied dash for relief. In fact, the sensation of compassion for humankind lasted throughout the day - so much so, I felt I would risk ridicule by disclosing these rather personal details about my relationship with Walter and the spiritual moments we often enjoy together to share with you a little of the wonders of chanting. Chanting has been used as a self-entrancing device by Eastern and Western spiritual paths for as long as any boddisatva round here can remember. From repeating Hail Marys to hailing Ganesh the Hindu elephant god, we have always used vocal sound to instigate an altered state of mind, one that transcends local concerns and sees beyond the world of distinctions to the perfection within (it and oneself). In a way, it wouldn't matter what sound you repeated: the actual vibrations would engender physical comfort and relaxation from within, like an internally applied sonic massage. However, I must report from personal experience that there is an essence carried in these sacred chants of East and West, passed down by disciples and holy ones through the ages, which seems to affect you more profoundly than would, say, chanting, 'Roll me out into the marketplace' or other such nonsense. But more importantly, and this is the deep purpose of all the 'om' chanting, there is an a priori sound - the very sound of creation. It's the one referred to in the opening lines of the bible: 'God spoke, and said let there be light' (excuse me waxing so, but it is Sunday). The yogis refer to this sound as 'shabd', which, if one trains oneself to listen out for it in deepest meditation, will confer on one a profound sense of peace and wellbeing. All the omming and ahhing is just an attempt to mimic that original sound in order to set up a field of resonance. Try it now, if it doesn't feel too exotic for comfort. Take a full inbreath, allowing your ribcage to expand laterally and gently allow to escape from deep within your belly the sound 'AUM!', stretching out the 'AU' as long as possible before closing your lips for the final 'M'. If you find that vaguely relaxing, try repeating it for up to nine breaths' worth. Then rest for a moment or two in the inner silence and see if you can hear (or hear if you can see) the original sound of creation for yourself. Your questions Dear Barefoot Doctor, Although I eat well and drink lots of water, I suffer from excess oily skin. My skin has been like this since my early teens and I'm used to it but now, at 25, my skin scars more easily from spots and I always have blackheads around my nose and chin that seem raised. Conventional medication fails to help. Nick, via email It sounds as if your liver and spleen energies are unbalanced, causing stomach heat to errantly rise along the meridian to the oral region. This was probably caused initially by a wobble in the kidney energy around puberty (kidney energy controls hormonal transitions but also supports the liver and spleen). As well as trying the biochemical tissue salts version of silica (not the homeopathic version) - four every (waking) hour for a few days - massage with palms briskly across the upper abdomen 81 times from left to right and then repeat from right to left, morning and evening, indefinitely. This is known as harmonising liver and spleen and is generally good for health and stamina, but will help to settle the stomach heat. Also try cleansing the region with witch hazel. Dear Barefoot, I have lots of tiny growths on my neck. My GP has said it's a very common and harmless condition. The problem is that I seem to have them on parts of my body that l habitually touch or rub, and now I'm developing an aversion to touching my neck because of this problem. Can you please help?

      "body": "<p>April is the cruellest month, breeding <br> Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing <br> Memory and desire, stirring <br> Dull roots with spring rain <br> <b>TS Eliot, 'The Wasteland ' </b></p> <p>If you are like me, you long for the spring, and when it arrives you feel refreshed and hopeful and bursting with plans for the months ahead. Not so my husband. He notes the longer days, sees the new green leaves, and feels the warmer sunshine, but if he is depressed, these changes often only serve to make him worse. Despite the spring, he feels no joy and sees no purpose in living, and this fact deepens his despair.</p> <p>Next week is National Depression Week, organised by the Depression Alliance to raise awareness of depression as a common and treatable condition. It is estimated that one in four people will suffer from depression at some point, and that more than 5m people in the UK are suffering at any given time. But while public awareness of depression continues to grow, the day-to-day reality of living with someone who is depressed is much less discussed, and the heartache it often involves largely hidden.</p> <p>When my husband was in his early twenties, his father, mother and grandfather all died within the space of two years. He sunk into a depression so severe that he could no longer go to work. His GP referred him to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist said he needed to see him twice a week, but was so busy that he issued an appointment for six weeks later. At that appointment a different psychiatrist turned up, and understandably my husband didn't bother going back. He took antidepressants for a short time, but over the years exercise has been, for him, a better therapy.</p> <p>We were married with two young children at that time, and neither of us had any experience of depression. Being a naturally bouncy person, such pessimism was alien to me. Clinical depression was a complete mystery. I hadn't a clue as to how to help. I listened to his woes and tried to offer my own solutions, to get him to cheer up and to look on the bright side. But, of course, he couldn't, and my optimism made him feel worse.</p> <p>I have now learned a lot more about the symptoms of depression and know what to do to help. But it's hard to stay strong and sound positive when the man I love is chronically distressed. Although he has never again been diagnosed as clinically depressed, he has suffered from waves of mild or moderate depression throughout his life. (Statistics show that a person suffering from one episode of depression has a 50 per cent chance of suffering a further one.) It is the long-term, unremitting gloom of moderate as well as severe depression which causes attrition in a relationship and can make it so difficult for a partner to bear. This is obviously not so distressing as living with someone who is suffering from a mental illness with disruptive or violent outbursts, but in its own way depression can turn domestic life into an endurance test.</p> <p>Living with a partner who is depressed is more lonely than living alone. You share your space with someone, who, to all intents and purposes, just isn't there. You speak to them and they reply, but you know that there's no contact. It's as if they've erected a thick brick wall to keep you out. There's no ordinary interchange, nor any intimacy, and this feels bleak and hopeless. Loss of libido is a common symptom of depression, but I find an interrupted sex life easier to cope with than a total lack of warmth and affection.</p> <p>It is rare, these days, for him to sink into silent mode. Mostly he will talk about how he feels. But I struggle to remain cheerful when I hear, over and over, how his life has been a complete waste, how it is one long list of regrets, and how he cannot see anything ahead but a long line of empty days.</p> <p>I have had to get used to the Eleanor Rigby effect, too. Being outwardly positive in his professional role is exhausting, and like everyone, he needs to be himself when he's at home. He may be slumped and silent in the chair in the corner when we are alone together, but when a visitor comes, he puts on the face that he keeps in a jar by the door, and becomes all charm and smiles. Sometimes, when he sees I'm feeling worn down by his gloom, he makes a huge effort for me, too, which is a relief.</p> <p>But in a down phase, whatever conversational ball I toss him will be slammed back with a negative spin. This may seem trivial, but when it goes on for weeks at a time, it is wearing. Sometimes I give up, and we may go for days with communication confined to passing the salt, putting the bins out and what to get from the shops.</p> <p>If a friend asks me out for the evening, to have some fun and light relief, I will dither about whether to go. If he wants me to stay at home with him, I will, but if it's</p> <p>not going to make any difference, I'd rather go. I need the sustenance of warm support that I can be sure of, and I need the break from the grim coldness of dank, dark blankets of unhappiness that swathe the house when he is down.</p> <p>A friend of mine, whose partner is depressed, says, 'I sometimes wonder whether it's my fault - maybe having an argument the night before brought it on - even though I know rationally it's not. I have to remind myself not to get cross about things, and if I feel he's being unfair and he's in a particularly bad state, I have to remember to bite my tongue - that it's not really him, and he's not seeing things as they really are. There's also the feeling that the one person who should be close to you is really far away from you, so when you most need reassurance you have no one to go to. You just have to remind yourself that things will eventually be OK again.'</p> <p>With time and/or treatment, depression does ebb, and when this happens it is a huge relief, but because my husband has a history of recurrent depression, I don't feel able to rely on a period of optimism lasting indefinitely. On the other hand, what keeps me going is the fact is that the troughs don't last forever either.</p> <p>When I read through the first draft of this article, I almost felt like going to see the doctor myself. It was not meant to be one long list of complaints. I wanted to explain to those outside the situation a little of what it is like to live with a depressive, and I wanted those inside to feel less lonely. I feel guilty complaining - I have not been the one with a black incubus sitting on my shoulder for the last 25 years, after all. I have had lots of fun and joy, and also the good fortune to share my life with someone who is sensitive, caring, loyal, hugely talented and, surprisingly, very funny.</p> <p>I was recently asked if I'd ever felt like leaving him - well, many years ago I did and regretted it.

You can become very self-obsessed when people pour attention on you, and I'm afraid I did. I'd go to every premiere and event going, but it wasn't making me happy. Now - and this is partly since knowing Claire - my priorities have changed and I don't party nearly so much. <p>Claire and I became close when I went to Brazil for Oxfam's Education Now campaign. We've both got young children and we bonded on that trip because it was so upsetting meeting the glue-sniffing street children of Recife. In fact, we bonded from day one when I lost all my shoes and make-up in transit and had to borrow Claire's. We had a good laugh that day and we've laughed and cried together ever since. </p> <p>Claire's got the human touch. She's not patronising and doesn't make me do things, but at the same time she has the ability to milk me. Even if I feel I can't do another thing, after talking to Claire I'll usually say, 'Oh, all right then.' </p> <p>But our relationship goes way beyond Oxfam. We talk about everything - family matters, boyfriend problems, clothes. Through Claire, I've become much more politically aware. Before, I didn't get involved much. My conscience was blocked off - I guess I was waiting for someone to unblock it. I'm not interested in politics but I'm interested in human issues. You can still be non-political and try to change things. </p> <p>Brazil was a life-changing experience and I came back determined to do more. So three months later I put on a fund-raising celebrity event in London called Brazil Nuts to raise money for the projects I'd seen. That's when Claire and I got really close. It took incredible determination and there were lots of disappointments along the way because celebrities can be so flaky. </p> <p>I'm certainly happier and more fulfilled since knowing Claire. I never went to university and regret not studying, but my involvement with Oxfam has given me a new interest and a new passion. Claire and I joke that because I know so much about Oxfam I should one day take an ology in it. </p> <p> <b> Claire Lewis: </b> What I like about Michelle is that she's a wised-up single mum with no airs and graces. You can walk down the road and people will shout, 'All right Cindy?' and she can play that role, but she's also an intelligent, savvy woman with real depth - far more so than people think. </p> <p>People react in different ways to seeing poverty, and in Brazil, Michelle reacted like me. We felt very emotional visiting the street kids and something maternal clicked in us. On our way back, she said to me, 'I don't see you as an Oxfam worker, I see you as a friend.' Later, at her Brazil Nuts event, just as Oxfam was presenting her with a bouquet for all her incredible hard work, she said into the microphone: 'I want to thank Claire, because she's the person who's really changed my life and got me involved.' It was a very moving moment. </p> <p>When I first met Michelle I thought I'd be dealing with someone who wanted to help, but would need a lot of support. But it's amazing how she holds her own. She can talk to government ministers and has obviously been recognised by the Labour Party as a key celebrity supporter. </p> <p>At Glastonbury, she spoke on behalf of Oxfam in front of a crowd of 30,000. There was tiny little Michelle Collins, who everyone knows as the soap star Cindy, speaking with such passion about how 84 per cent of people killed in war are civilians. By the time she'd finished, everyone was cheering and shrieking, 'Cindy, Cindy, Cindy.' She came off absolutely buzzing. </p> <p>On a personal level, I've got someone in my life who I can talk to about anything. Since knowing her I've upped the quality of my make-up, and my personal phone bills are much higher because we talk every day. Although I'm not a single mum, I've got a glimpse of what it's like bringing up a child alone. You have to be tough. I admire Michelle like one admires a big sister. </p> <p>At Glastonbury we were driven on-site on these two massive bikes. Both the bikers wanted to put Michelle on the back of theirs and I felt like the fat, ugly one. If we were to go on the pull, there's no question that Michelle would always get the better bloke!</p>",

      "body": "<p>Ruby and Millie have not stopped chatting for at least 20 minutes. The doorbell rang - a deep Big Ben chime - and Ruby opened it to let Millie in. They didn't even stop to say hello. Just straight in there. Chatter, chatter, chatter, chat. And then Millie's mobile phone rang, and she continued to chat. Ruby promptly picked up the phone and made a call. Millie got off her call first, and asked me if I wanted a cup of tea, and set to in the kitchen, continuing where she had left off with Ruby as soon as her call was over. They met over a decade ago ('We just clicked') and are now a perfect working partnership. When they don't see each other, they say they talk on the phone. 'Fifty times a day.'</p> <p>I was there to interview Ruby Hammer, 37, make-up artist, businesswoman and mother of one, about her home. She and Millie Kendall, 33, set up in business together two years ago, with their own range of make-up. You might have seen it in Boots. It's very well packaged, all hi-tech, see-through plastic, with a massive choice of 300 products, colours and unctions to choose from. They decided that if they were going to do it, they wanted to do it properly, and they wanted their products to be high quality, affordable and accessible. They also wanted them to look good on people's dressing tables. They are both suckers for a bit of packaging, and admit that they will pay over the odds for it.</p> <p>Millie arrived this morning, clutching a new Courreges perfume in a see-through Perspex tube. Very Barbarella , 60s futuristic. They examine it. Ruby says she likes the smell. It will be added to her collection. Both are make-up maniacs. They love the stuff - collect it, play with it, work with it, buy it, and cherish it. It is, literally, their world.</p> <p>So, when I can get a word in (well, more like a single syllable) between 10 of theirs, Ruby offers to give me a guided tour of her home. It's impressive before you even set foot inside the door. She lives on the fifth floor of an incredible 1920s apartment block just off the Marylebone Road in north London. It's pure Gotham City, from the revolving doors that lead from the little driveway, where taxis stop to let their passengers disembark, to the vast entrance foyer, where a porter greets you from behind his lectern. There are two fountains on either side of him, and marble pillars everywhere. It could be the entrance foyer to a grand New York hotel. Everything is in its original state. There is no need for restoration, because the place has obviously always been looked after. The service charge runs to thousands per year. But at least you can see how it's spent.</p> <p>The doormat next to Ruby's has a neatly folded copy of The Times , waiting for its owner to shuffle out in his slippers and dressing gown for a quiet read with breakfast. It's like a hotel. For Ruby, who has a hectic, erratic lifestyle, the service has become indispensable. Couriers can leave packages for her at the front desk, and she knows that if she's out on a shoot, there will always be someone there. It's all part of her support system. 'It suits my life,' she says. 'I've always juggled my work and my family.' Recently divorced, she now lives in the generous three-bedroom apartment with her 14-year-old daughter, Reena.</p> <p>'When I came here, it was 15 years ago and I was pregnant,' she says. She had just finished her economics degree at university and had got married. The purpose-built block was perfect, just five minute's walk from Regents Park, and best of all, with a roof garden on top. Ruby suggests I take a look on my way out, and I can't resist. Sure enough, up among the chimney tops and TV aerials, there is a fully established garden, with trellises, roses, rhododendrons, lawns, vines and tall trees. 'My little girl had a paddling pool and a Wendy house up there,' says Ruby. 'We'd take a picnic. You'd never know there's an oasis up there.' All right in the centre of London, which is another reason why the place is so perfect - Ruby doesn't drive and likes to be in the thick of things. She needs to know that she can step outside and hail a taxi without a problem.</p> <p>The main reception area looks as though it hasn't changed for 80 years. The furniture is all Art Deco, perfect period pieces like the building itself. 'This was our family home,' says Ruby. 'We put in everything.' When they moved in, there were only two bathrooms, each with a huge cast-iron bath (now there is one in every bedroom, plus a few to spare). There's even a sauna, although Ruby admits she rarely uses it. The stainless-steel and white-tiled kitchen is 12 years old, but Bulthaup never dates. There is a second living room, lined with books, for cosy evenings with a takeaway and a video. Pinned on one wall is a collection of Ruby's snapshots of family and friends. Next to Reena's room ('She wears make-up, but she's not fanatical about it - she's more of a clotheshorse') there's a guest room which is completely out of character with the rest of the apartment. 'My ex-husband did it as a romantic gesture,' she says. It's her own little corner of India, painted pink, with the sunlight filtering in from a single window. 'This is my roots,' says Ruby.</p> <p>In her bedroom there's a walk-in dressing room, and centre stage, a Deco dressing table with a big round mirror. It is groaning with perfume bottles, face creams and other pots and tubes of pigment and powder. 'I have lots of everything,' says Ruby. 'Millie and I are product junkies. We have tonnes of make-up.' And to prove it, she shows me into her office, a 'working lab' where she works out colours and ideas for the range. 'For work, for playing, whatever, this is my life,' she says, gesturing around the little stacks of lip colours, eye shadows and powders. There are boxes stacked floor-to-ceiling, filled with samples - a working reference library with everything from old Biba and Mary Quant colours to Chanel, Shu Uemura and Aveda.</p> <p>Last year, Ruby and Millie launched their beauty book, Face Up , published by Ebury Press. 'I have a great love for what I do,' says Ruby, who began experimenting with make-up as a child and became a make-up artist because she was bored with painting her own face. Over the years, she has glossed the lips and flicked the eyelashes of Cher, Kate Moss, Madonna and Dolly Parton. The day before we met, she was working with the Popstars band Hear'Say on a magazine shoot. 'I've just worked like a lunatic,' she says. And now she's back home for a day. But somehow, as she and Millie carry on their discussions about work, life and the wrong shade of purple, it seems to be the start of just another working day. *</p>",

      "body": "<p>The homeless hustler in Times Square knows a celebrity when he sees one. He targets the smooth-featured man in the Kaptain Robbie Knievel bomber jacket and starts jabbering excitedly. 'Rob!' 'Rob!' Donny Osmond doesn't know if he's being mugged or mobbed. He smiles that toothsome megawatt smile that plastered the bedroom walls of millions of pre-pubescent girls in the early 70s. He may be slightly alarmed but he's clearly pleased that the passing of time has not dimmed recognition of his ever-wholesome features. But we can't quite catch the drift of his admirer's words. It's only the tighter grin of his wife Debbie that alerts us that she knows something we don't. She chuckles before letting him in on the secret, 'He thinks you're Rob Lowe.'</p> <p>Thirty years ago, such confusion would have been inconceivable. Donny Osmond was the biggest teen idol of them all. He was the cutest and youngest of the Osmonds, the crooning Mormon brothers who started singing to spread the word of their religion, and went on to sell 80m records. Donny was already a showbiz veteran when, at age 14, he sang his own way into the charts - and every little girl's heart - with 'Puppy Love', followed by a string of saccharine solo hits such as 'Too Young' and 'The Twelfth of Never'. If you were a girl aged between six and 16, you loved Donny, with his full lips, big white teeth, bouffant hair (sometimes tucked under a cute cap), tank tops and purple socks. Especially in England, where so many girls turned up to greet him at Heathrow Airport in 1973 that a balcony collapsed.</p> <p>Obviously, he was despised by critics and boys of all ages. Donny Osmond could have any girl he wanted - except he didn't. For he was not only too young, he was also a devout Mormon who did not drink - no alcohol or caffeine - or smoke or take drugs or swear or have sex before marriage. What on earth was the point of him being a pop superstar? At least his arch rival David Cassidy screwed his way through fame before screwing up with his very own drink-and-drug-hell and ending up in stage musicals.</p> <p>Which is just where Donny has ended up, too, only without the sex and drugs. Or the rock'n'roll. Donny's career, which began at the age of five when he joined his brothers' barbershop quartet on the Andy Williams Show and peaked in his early teens, was effectively over before he turned 20. Having already exchanged pop for television, teaming up with his sister in the Donny and Marie Show, he then committed the unpardonable teen-idol sin of getting married. Cue a decade in the wilderness with the end of his pop and TV careers and the collapse of the Osmond financial empire.</p> <p>Then, after a failed stage musical in the early 80s and a brief pop comeback later that decade, came the rebirth of Donny Osmond in musical theatre. He was the toast of Broadway, spending six years starring in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolored Dream Coat. He got back on the telly with a new Donny and Marie Show. Now he has recorded his first album in more than a decade: a collection of showtunes combined - for UK audiences only - with new versions of half a dozen of his old hits.</p> <p>He's there for a TV special showcasing his new material, culled from shows such as Guys and Dolls and Aida, at the Hammerstein Ballroom. It's a low-key affair: the only people outside are the ones catching a last puff of a cigarette before entering the Mormon-friendly venue, where there is a ban on both alcohol and tobacco. Inside, it's full of fans. They scream when he walks on in a black-satin shirt and black slacks, looking more or less the same as he did back in the old days. His teeth, he won't thank me for reporting, still gleam flawlessly.</p> <p>The audience, which includes a large number of women with small children, screams in excitement. 'I love you, Donny!' shouts a woman in a box. 'I love you too, baby!' quips Donny. 'Don't jump!' How we chuckle!</p> <p>At the end, Donny is joined on stage by Vanessa Williams for a 'surprise' number. Well, there's only one it could be, isn't there? Apparently tonight's trip down memory lane is making a little bit of history because Donny, haunted by the legacy of his biggest hit for a quarter of a century, has not performed 'Puppy Love' for 20 years. Until now.</p> <p>Next morning in a mid-town hotel restaurant, he explains exactly what effect 'Puppy Love' has had on his life. 'It's been a milestone for me,' he says.</p> <p>But it has also been a millstone. Children taunted him with it when he went to visit his girlfriend at school. Disc jockeys warbled awful parodies of it for years afterwards. He began sending himself up, singing pastiches of it during interviews. Now it's time to reclaim his signature tune.</p> <p>'I totally regret embarrassing \"Puppy Love\" now,' he says, rather touchingly, as if the song is a human being and he is concerned for its feelings. It turns out to be typical of Donny Osmond as a man. Despite having had more than his fair share of false dawns in his post-Osmond career, he retains an innocent optimism that shines through everything he says. He answers everything with a sometimes alarming honesty. He's a very nice man.</p> <p>Over in London a month later for a media and music-industry showcase, he sings 'Puppy Love' again. The front of the stage is thronged by women in their early forties. These are the girls who once thronged the Heathrow balcony for a glimpse of their idol. When he sings 'Puppy Love', a couple of them throw knickers at the stage, and when Donny leaves the show he is mobbed by a gang of almost 100 women outside the door. It's just like the old days.</p> <p>'It was amazing to see all those people,' he says back at his hotel over a pot of herbal tea. 'It wasn't like the past until I went outside. You know, it's funny: the people around me now, the security people - even my manager - have no idea what I went through. They were saying: \"This is unbelievable.\" I said: \"This is nothing.\" Then they turned to me and said: \"Shall we go to the car real fast?\" And I said: \"No, let me enjoy it!\"' Donny emits a high-pitched cackle of mirth and starts slapping me jovially on the knee to help me share the joke.</p> <p>No one under the age of 40 today will really remember Osmondmania. It was as big as Beatlemania at its height. There is simply no comparison with the hysteria around today's interchangeable Westlife, Backstreet Boys or 'N Sync. The Osmonds were the biggest band on the planet and Donny was their golden nugget. With their wholesome Christian image and family values - mirrored in their two biggest chart rivals of the time, the Partridge Family and the Jackson Five - they were a blueprint for today's clean-cut crop of bland boy bands.</p> <p>But, it now transpires, behind the image of brotherly love lay seething resentment when Donny's solo success (followed by Marie and Jimmy) put paid to their own aspirations as a rock band. Not that Donny knew about that. It was only last year that he discovered their true feelings when each brother was asked to give an account of their career for a made-for-television biopic. 'They felt I had screwed up their career!' Donny reveals with amazement. 'When I read the script and saw what they had said, I thought: \"You're kidding!\" I had never realised it.'</p> <p>When the brothers all got together for the first time in years to make a guest appearance in the film's final scene, words were exchanged. There were even some 'heated moments'. But, typically, Donny found it a healing process. 'It was very therapeutic and cathartic,' he says. And he's glad he never knew what they were thinking behind his back. 'It would have destroyed me.'</p> <p>Donny was the seventh of the nine children born to George Virl Osmond, a wartime US army sergeant, and Olive May Davis, who met shortly after the end of the Second World War in Ogden, Utah. They married and, as Donny put it in his recent autobiography, 'discovered they shared the same dream: to have a large family'. The first two children, Virl and Tom, were born deaf. By the time Donny came along on 9 December 1957, they had been joined by Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay. Then came Marie and, finally, Jimmy.</p> <p>It was a religious home, with strict discipline, and a musical one. Both parents sang, and Olive taught all the children to play sax. Every Friday the entire family would get together in the living room for Family Night to discuss domestic issues, read from the Scriptures and sing together.</p> <p>Out of these family get-togethers were born the Osmonds. Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay were taught four-part harmony and became an attraction at local events, performing as a child group, later becoming a barbershop quartet, and earning money that would be saved up for their 'missions' in later life. Mormons are expected to spend two years away from home when they leave school, spreading the word abroad (Donny was excused - the church felt his music did the work itself), and are supported by their families.</p> <p>In 1962, the brothers found work at Disneyland and Walt himself gave them their TV debut on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. That was followed by a five-year spell on the Andy Williams Show . The quartet became a quintet when Donny was introduced shortly before his sixth birthday. By the age of eight, Donny was touring Sweden with the brothers, 6,000 miles from home. Without his mum, without any room to play with his toys on the bus, the eight-year-old boy was lonely, tired and homesick. He wrote home to tell her how how much he missed playing in his sandpit, hoping she would fly to Sweden to bring him home.</p> <p>But when George, a strict disciplinarian who assigned each child a number for family head counts, found out what he had written, his response was less than sympathetic. He gave his son a beating and a lecture about not complaining.</p> <p>It must have been humiliating, but Donny refuses to condemn his father, who is still alive. 'It's easy to blame the parent,' he acknowledges. 'I got over that quickly and realised my father is not perfect but he did the best he could. He was very strict and all that, but you have to remember that he was an army sergeant who was raised by an abusive stepfather and he was kicked out of the house when he was in his teens. When you look at his background, the man is a hero. Especially keeping nine children together in the world of show business. He really did it right, in my opinion. He disciplined us the best way he possibly could.' Donny pauses and adds: 'I am raising my children quite differently.'</p> <p>Donny has five children of his own, all boys, aged between 22 and three. He and his wife have tried to give them the thing he missed: a childhood. None of them is in show business. He hopes they will all maintain the Mormon way of life, with its rigorous rules.</p> <p>Donny was married at 20, and his wife Debbie remains his only lover. I ask him whether he would like his sons to be like him.</p> <p>'I was a virgin when I got married and I would hope that my children, based on my beliefs and what I have taught them, would follow suit,' he says.</p> <p>And are they still virgins?</p> <p>Anguish fills Donny's features. He looks away. His jaw clenches, he is silent for ages, drumming his fingers on the table in frustration. I think he is blushing. He is certainly struggling with something inside. 'I just don't know how far to take this,' he says finally. 'I knew it would come up sooner or later.'</p> <p>He admits he's had father-son showdowns with his eldest two, but he doesn't want to go into details. He looks so tormented - clearly Donny Osmond's religious principles won't let him lie to hide embarrassing secrets - that I suggest we speak hypothetically. He thanks me. So I wonder how he might hypothetically feel if any of his children opted for the sex and drugs and Coca-Cola lifestyle he shuns.</p> <p>'They would know my disappointment, but they would know it is an open door,' he replies. 'I am not going to condemn anybody. That's where religion gets a bad name, when people get holier than thou. We are all human. If my children make a mistake, I want them to know it is all right and they should try harder next time.'</p> <p>When we next meet, a month later in London, Donny is more forthcoming. He reveals that his second son, Jeremy, rebelled against everything he holds dear. He pierced his tongue and eyebrow and dyed his hair with leopard spots. He rejected the church. He left home. He did not speak to his father - or any of the rest of the family - for four years. It is entirely possible that he has partaken of forbidden fruit such as coffee and tea and even sex and drugs. Their estrangement brought Donny a great deal of pain and distress, not least because he feels responsible.</p> <p>'I think a lot of the rebellion came from the fact that he was my son - you know, this whole Osmond thing,' he says. 'He couldn't stand the whole Osmond image. When you are forced to be a certain thing, that's why you want to rebel: \"I don't want to be pigeonholed, I don't want to be just another Mormon Osmond\", you know.'</p> <p>In high school, Jeremy got into associating with an element - 'I'm not going to say the wrong kids, because every single one of those kids has turned around their lives and are wonderful human beings and I think they are stronger because of it.' Another happy ending. 'Jeremy and I didn't communicate for four years. But in the end he realised: \"You know what, I don't need to do this.\" He came back. And now he is serving a mission in Italy.'</p> <p>His son's rebellion against 'the whole Osmond thing' must have struck a chord with Donny, whose lifelong compulsion to please everybody resulted in a series of panic attacks that led him to seek treatment in the mid-90s. He was diagnosed with 'social phobia' and learned through therapy that he had developed a deep-rooted fear of being ridiculed in public. In the 80s he was advised by Michael Jackson - a friend from their days as child stars together - to change his name if he wanted to rebuild his career. His own manager had a more drastic suggestion for shedding the goody-goody Osmond image, advising Donny to be arrested for drugs.</p> <p>The Osmond thing has followed him for as long as he can remember. He says he can remember 'weird feelings of stage fright' dating back to the age of 11. They returned just as he had found success on Broadway in Joseph. 'I think it was a lot to do with the fact that I had become successful again,' he says. 'I lost my career in my early twenties. Then Joseph came along and I said: \"I'm going to take a chance and try musical theatre.\"'</p> <p>He had tried it once before, on Broadway in 1982, and the show had acquired the unique distinction of opening and closing on the same night, crucified by the critics. 'So here I was 10 years later, and the nerves kicked in.' He knew he might be subjecting himself to more ridicule. 'But the worst thing happened: it became successful. So now I had to be perfect: \"People are paying a lot of money to see me in the show and if I make a mistake, they are not going to get their money's worth. And I'm going to look like an idiot.\" And that's what threw me into this abyss.' He pauses. 'After a lot of therapy, now I realise I don't have to be perfect.'</p> <p>But if he can cope with imperfection, Donny still yearns for the one thing he never had. He has always wanted to be cool. He had a distorted childhood. He had no friends outside his family. He was a professional entertainer by the age of five, when other children were at school. In his early teens, he was receiving up to 50,000 fan letters a week. But he was never cool. Perhaps that's why he gets so excited when I suggest he employs Puff Daddy to remix his biggest hit with the title 'Puffy Love'. Donny loves the idea. 'And if he can't do it, maybe we could get Snoop Dogg - \"Doggy Love\"!'</p> <p>'Put my shoes on for a second,' Donny demands. 'I was never considered cool throughout my teens: a very important time to be accepted by someone, especially your peers. Yes, I had all the screaming women, but the guys hated my guts.'</p> <p>What Donny craves is acceptance from his peers - but boys his age liked rock music. Donny missed out on that. And he had a rotten time when he tried to mix outside the close confines of his famous family. 'When Jay and I went on our bikes to see Debbie at high school, the guys started throwing dirt clods at us and calling us all kinds of names - just because I was Donny Osmond,' he recalls. 'They started teasing Debbie when I began dating her: they put this cassette machine in a garbage can and it started playing \"Puppy Love\" as she walked by. Those kinds of things have a tendency to wear on you in your own personal psyche.'</p> <p>He looks me straight in the eye. 'Maybe I am a little bit guilty of trying to convince myself that I am cool to this point - even today. But I am so much more healthy than I used to be in my twenties, because I was not accepted at all. Just the mere fact that I did \"Puppy Love\" today - it was my idea - was kinda like a reinforcement within myself saying, \"You know what, it's OK now.\"'</p> <p>Yet, despite his successful career and happy family life, Donny still seems to be unduly concerned with what other people think of him. Perhaps it's the legacy of those child-star days; perhaps he wants his childhood back. At least he hasn't tried to recreate it like his contemporary Michael Jackson. I ask him if he still wants to be cool, and he goes silent for 10 whole seconds before he replies with typical honesty. 'I guess so,' he says quietly. 'I'd be lying if I said to you: \"No, I don't care.\" I'm comfortable in myself, but does that make me cool in everybody else's eyes?' He thinks about it. 'I don't care. I'm going to be true to what I want to do, because if I care what people think about me, I'm a puppet. Which I have been in my life. And you can't live life that way, man!'</p> <p>He tries to put his finger on what he is still searching for. 'If we strip it down, I think it's about being yourself,' he decides. 'I think that one day, if I've made it, and I have every intention of making it - in the sense that I want to still be married when I leave this planet - I want to have grandkids, I want them to love me. I want to be a cool grandpa.'</p> <p>We meet for the last time at the Brit Awards, where Donny is presenting Madonna's award with Helena Christiansen, who towers above him in her heels. He gets a laugh by bending down onstage and taking them off her feet. Later, at his record company's private party, I ask him if he's met Eminem, who is holding court behind a curtain. Donny's over there like a shot, talking himself in past a security man who's never heard of him. I kick myself for not bringing a camera. Donny Osmond and Eminem together: that would be one cool photo. When he emerges, he says that Eminem told him he was a big influence on him in his life. I'm not sure who is joking.</p>",

'It was amazing to see all those people,' he says back at his hotel over a pot of herbal tea. 'It wasn't like the past until I went outside. You know, it's funny: the people around me now, the security people - even my manager - have no idea what I went through. They were saying: \"This is unbelievable.\" I said: \"This is nothing.\" Then they turned to me and said: \"Shall we go to the car real fast?\" And I said: \"No, let me enjoy it!\"' Donny emits a high-pitched cackle of mirth and starts slapping me jovially on the knee to help me share the joke. No one under the age of 40 today will really remember Osmondmania. It was as big as Beatlemania at its height. There is simply no comparison with the hysteria around today's interchangeable Westlife, Backstreet Boys or 'N Sync. The Osmonds were the biggest band on the planet and Donny was their golden nugget. With their wholesome Christian image and family values - mirrored in their two biggest chart rivals of the time, the Partridge Family and the Jackson Five - they were a blueprint for today's clean-cut crop of bland boy bands. But, it now transpires, behind the image of brotherly love lay seething resentment when Donny's solo success (followed by Marie and Jimmy) put paid to their own aspirations as a rock band. Not that Donny knew about that. It was only last year that he discovered their true feelings when each brother was asked to give an account of their career for a made-for-television biopic. 'They felt I had screwed up their career!' Donny reveals with amazement. 'When I read the script and saw what they had said, I thought: \"You're kidding!\" I had never realised it.' When the brothers all got together for the first time in years to make a guest appearance in the film's final scene, words were exchanged. There were even some 'heated moments'. But, typically, Donny found it a healing process. 'It was very therapeutic and cathartic,' he says. And he's glad he never knew what they were thinking behind his back. 'It would have destroyed me.' Donny was the seventh of the nine children born to George Virl Osmond, a wartime US army sergeant, and Olive May Davis, who met shortly after the end of the Second World War in Ogden, Utah. They married and, as Donny put it in his recent autobiography, 'discovered they shared the same dream: to have a large family'. The first two children, Virl and Tom, were born deaf. By the time Donny came along on 9 December 1957, they had been joined by Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay. Then came Marie and, finally, Jimmy. It was a religious home, with strict discipline, and a musical one. Both parents sang, and Olive taught all the children to play sax. Every Friday the entire family would get together in the living room for Family Night to discuss domestic issues, read from the Scriptures and sing together. Out of these family get-togethers were born the Osmonds. Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay were taught four-part harmony and became an attraction at local events, performing as a child group, later becoming a barbershop quartet, and earning money that would be saved up for their 'missions' in later life. Mormons are expected to spend two years away from home when they leave school, spreading the word abroad (Donny was excused - the church felt his music did the work itself), and are supported by their families. In 1962, the brothers found work at Disneyland and Walt himself gave them their TV debut on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. That was followed by a five-year spell on the Andy Williams Show . The quartet became a quintet when Donny was introduced shortly before his sixth birthday. By the age of eight, Donny was touring Sweden with the brothers, 6,000 miles from home. Without his mum, without any room to play with his toys on the bus, the eight-year-old boy was lonely, tired and homesick. He wrote home to tell her how how much he missed playing in his sandpit, hoping she would fly to Sweden to bring him home. But when George, a strict disciplinarian who assigned each child a number for family head counts, found out what he had written, his response was less than sympathetic. He gave his son a beating and a lecture about not complaining. It must have been humiliating, but Donny refuses to condemn his father, who is still alive. 'It's easy to blame the parent,' he acknowledges. 'I got over that quickly and realised my father is not perfect but he did the best he could. He was very strict and all that, but you have to remember that he was an army sergeant who was raised by an abusive stepfather and he was kicked out of the house when he was in his teens. When you look at his background, the man is a hero. Especially keeping nine children together in the world of show business. He really did it right, in my opinion. He disciplined us the best way he possibly could.' Donny pauses and adds: 'I am raising my children quite differently.' Donny has five children of his own, all boys, aged between 22 and three. He and his wife have tried to give them the thing he missed: a childhood. None of them is in show business. He hopes they will all maintain the Mormon way of life, with its rigorous rules. Donny was married at 20, and his wife Debbie remains his only lover. I ask him whether he would like his sons to be like him. 'I was a virgin when I got married and I would hope that my children, based on my beliefs and what I have taught them, would follow suit,' he says. And are they still virgins? Anguish fills Donny's features. He looks away. His jaw clenches, he is silent for ages, drumming his fingers on the table in frustration. I think he is blushing. He is certainly struggling with something inside. 'I just don't know how far to take this,' he says finally. 'I knew it would come up sooner or later.' He admits he's had father-son showdowns with his eldest two, but he doesn't want to go into details. He looks so tormented - clearly Donny Osmond's religious principles won't let him lie to hide embarrassing secrets - that I suggest we speak hypothetically. He thanks me. So I wonder how he might hypothetically feel if any of his children opted for the sex and drugs and Coca-Cola lifestyle he shuns. 'They would know my disappointment, but they would know it is an open door,' he replies. 'I am not going to condemn anybody. That's where religion gets a bad name, when people get holier than thou. We are all human. If my children make a mistake, I want them to know it is all right and they should try harder next time.' When we next meet, a month later in London, Donny is more forthcoming. He reveals that his second son, Jeremy, rebelled against everything he holds dear. He pierced his tongue and eyebrow and dyed his hair with leopard spots. He rejected the church. He left home. He did not speak to his father - or any of the rest of the family - for four years. It is entirely possible that he has partaken of forbidden fruit such as coffee and tea and even sex and drugs. Their estrangement brought Donny a great deal of pain and distress, not least because he feels responsible. 'I think a lot of the rebellion came from the fact that he was my son - you know, this whole Osmond thing,' he says. 'He couldn't stand the whole Osmond image. When you are forced to be a certain thing, that's why you want to rebel: \"I don't want to be pigeonholed, I don't want to be just another Mormon Osmond\", you know.' In high school, Jeremy got into associating with an element - 'I'm not going to say the wrong kids, because every single one of those kids has turned around their lives and are wonderful human beings and I think they are stronger because of it.' Another happy ending. 'Jeremy and I didn't communicate for four years. But in the end he realised: \"You know what, I don't need to do this.\" He came back. And now he is serving a mission in Italy.' His son's rebellion against 'the whole Osmond thing' must have struck a chord with Donny, whose lifelong compulsion to please everybody resulted in a series of panic attacks that led him to seek treatment in the mid-90s. He was diagnosed with 'social phobia' and learned through therapy that he had developed a deep-rooted fear of being ridiculed in public. In the 80s he was advised by Michael Jackson - a friend from their days as child stars together - to change his name if he wanted to rebuild his career. His own manager had a more drastic suggestion for shedding the goody-goody Osmond image, advising Donny to be arrested for drugs. The Osmond thing has followed him for as long as he can remember. He says he can remember 'weird feelings of stage fright' dating back to the age of 11. They returned just as he had found success on Broadway in Joseph. 'I think it was a lot to do with the fact that I had become successful again,' he says. 'I lost my career in my early twenties. Then Joseph came along and I said: \"I'm going to take a chance and try musical theatre.\"' He had tried it once before, on Broadway in 1982, and the show had acquired the unique distinction of opening and closing on the same night, crucified by the critics. 'So here I was 10 years later, and the nerves kicked in.' He knew he might be subjecting himself to more ridicule. 'But the worst thing happened: it became successful. So now I had to be perfect: \"People are paying a lot of money to see me in the show and if I make a mistake, they are not going to get their money's worth. And I'm going to look like an idiot.\" And that's what threw me into this abyss.' He pauses. 'After a lot of therapy, now I realise I don't have to be perfect.' But if he can cope with imperfection, Donny still yearns for the one thing he never had. He has always wanted to be cool. He had a distorted childhood. He had no friends outside his family. He was a professional entertainer by the age of five, when other children were at school. In his early teens, he was receiving up to 50,000 fan letters a week. But he was never cool. Perhaps that's why he gets so excited when I suggest he employs Puff Daddy to remix his biggest hit with the title 'Puffy Love'. Donny loves the idea. 'And if he can't do it, maybe we could get Snoop Dogg - \"Doggy Love\"!' 'Put my shoes on for a second,' Donny demands. 'I was never considered cool throughout my teens: a very important time to be accepted by someone, especially your peers. Yes, I had all the screaming women, but the guys hated my guts.' What Donny craves is acceptance from his peers - but boys his age liked rock music. Donny missed out on that. And he had a rotten time when he tried to mix outside the close confines of his famous family. 'When Jay and I went on our bikes to see Debbie at high school, the guys started throwing dirt clods at us and calling us all kinds of names - just because I was Donny Osmond,' he recalls. 'They started teasing Debbie when I began dating her: they put this cassette machine in a garbage can and it started playing \"Puppy Love\" as she walked by. Those kinds of things have a tendency to wear on you in your own personal psyche.' He looks me straight in the eye. 'Maybe I am a little bit guilty of trying to convince myself that I am cool to this point - even today. But I am so much more healthy than I used to be in my twenties, because I was not accepted at all. Just the mere fact that I did \"Puppy Love\" today - it was my idea - was kinda like a reinforcement within myself saying, \"You know what, it's OK now.\"' Yet, despite his successful career and happy family life, Donny still seems to be unduly concerned with what other people think of him. Perhaps it's the legacy of those child-star days; perhaps he wants his childhood back. At least he hasn't tried to recreate it like his contemporary Michael Jackson. I ask him if he still wants to be cool, and he goes silent for 10 whole seconds before he replies with typical honesty. 'I guess so,' he says quietly. 'I'd be lying if I said to you: \"No, I don't care.\" I'm comfortable in myself, but does that make me cool in everybody else's eyes?' He thinks about it. 'I don't care. I'm going to be true to what I want to do, because if I care what people think about me, I'm a puppet. Which I have been in my life. And you can't live life that way, man!' He tries to put his finger on what he is still searching for. 'If we strip it down, I think it's about being yourself,' he decides. 'I think that one day, if I've made it, and I have every intention of making it - in the sense that I want to still be married when I leave this planet - I want to have grandkids, I want them to love me. I want to be a cool grandpa.' We meet for the last time at the Brit Awards, where Donny is presenting Madonna's award with Helena Christiansen, who towers above him in her heels. He gets a laugh by bending down onstage and taking them off her feet. Later, at his record company's private party, I ask him if he's met Eminem, who is holding court behind a curtain. Donny's over there like a shot, talking himself in past a security man who's never heard of him. I kick myself for not bringing a camera. Donny Osmond and Eminem together: that would be one cool photo. When he emerges, he says that Eminem told him he was a big influence on him in his life. I'm not sure who is joking.",

      "body": "<p>A bout of soul-searching is troubling Germany as it tries to define the acceptable face of patriotism in a country where nationalism still has an ugly resonance.</p> <p>The debate, which reaches parliament this week, comes at a time when more than ever the German identity is under challenge and the mark, the currency associated with its finest postwar achievements, is about to be subsumed in the euro.</p> <p>What began as a squabble has polarised into a national debate. Centrist and left-wing politicians habitually shun patriotic rhetoric, but the mainstream conservative opposition has increasingly adopted the mantra of the extreme Right - Ich bin stolz ein Deutscher zu sein ('I'm proud to be German').</p> <p>When Laurenz Meyer, general secretary of the opposition Christian Democrats (CDU}, used the phrase in a magazine interview he was accused of 'having the mentality of a skinhead' by Environment Minister J\u00fcrgen Trittin.</p> <p>The 70-year-old President, Johannes Rau, was caught up in the debate. Asked on TV whether he too was proud to be German, he said he was 'happy and grateful' to be German, but that he 'couldn't be proud of it'.</p> <p>He explained: 'One cannot be proud of something one has not achieved oneself. It is not an achievement to be German, simply luck.'</p> <p>Thomas Goppel, general secretary of the Bavarian Christian Social Union, said Germans should question whether Rau was patriotic enough to lead Germany.</p> <p>But Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der appeared to back his friend. 'I am proud of the achievements of people and of the democratic culture. In this sense I am a German patriot, who is proud of his country,' the Chancellor told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.</p> <p>Rau later tried to quell criticism by developing his ideas to say that he was 'proud of that which we have achieved in Germany since 1949 and after 1989', referring to the country's postwar rebuilding and the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p> <p>Fritz Kuhn, head of the government coalition partner, the Green Party, has accused the conservative opposition of trying to win the support of the far Right.</p> <p>But the political row is far more than a linguistic challenge about expressing love for the fatherland without using the forbidden phrase. The conservatives hope that it will help them to unseat the Social Democrats in today's elections in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.</p> <p>According to conservative politicians, the extreme right-wing German Nationalist Party (NPD) approached the CDU last week asking if it could join its election campaign to hand out its 'I'm proud to be German' stickers. The CDU refused the request.</p> <p>Christoph Boehr, standing for the conservatives, has asked voters to sign a petition calling for Trittin's resignation. 'He is totally indifferent to Germany's culture, history and identity,' he said.</p> <p>Schr\u00f6der angrily retorted: 'No one has a monopoly on patriotic beliefs.' He has called for a parliamentary debate on German patriotism which will take place in the Bundestag this week.</p> <p>The 'pride debate' is seen as the successor of a debate on German leitkultur - the high points of national culture which conservative politicians are keen that foreigners should study.</p> <p>In hardly any other country is national pride such a controversial topic as in Germany, with its difficult recent history. Newspapers concluded as much last week as they dedicated whole pages to patriotism around the world. They observed that it was a particularly bad time for British patriotism.</p> <p>The popular tabloid Bild concluded that the country had much to be proud of and a past for which it had responsibility. 'Germany has a rich cultural heritage and a varied past. It is our duty to carry the responsibility for this: for Goethe as well as for Hitler, for Gutenberg and Frederick the Great. We should defend our free, humane Germany and be really proud of it', the paper insisted.</p> <p>Commentators say the fact that Germany is holding the soul-searching debate at all is a sign of the democratic maturity of a country which less than six decades ago was ruled by a dictator.</p> <p>Although the assertion of national pride has become the motto of the Right, the Turkish-born Green MP, Cem \u00d6zdemir, has tried to invert it into a symbol of inclusiveness. His website shows images of a black German citizen wearing a T-shirt carrying the phrase Ich bin stolz... <br> <b>What's in ...</b></p> <p>Goethe; beer; Wagner; Casper David Friedrich;</p> <p>Seventies activists and Red Army memorabilia;</p> <p>Denglisch, a mix of German and English;</p> <p>Mercedes; Beethoven;</p> <p>Vegetarianism;</p> <p>Steffi Graf;</p> <p>Garden gnomes.</p> <p><b>And what's out</b></p> <p>German flag; German language; Boris Becker since his divorce; sausages; white socks;</p> <p>Tony Blair and 'Cool Britannia';</p> <p>ageing footballers (ie the entire national team);</p> <p>folk music; talk shows.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A bout of soul-searching is troubling Germany as it tries to define the acceptable face of patriotism in a country where nationalism still has an ugly resonance. The debate, which reaches parliament this week, comes at a time when more than ever the German identity is under challenge and the mark, the currency associated with its finest postwar achievements, is about to be subsumed in the euro. What began as a squabble has polarised into a national debate. Centrist and left-wing politicians habitually shun patriotic rhetoric, but the mainstream conservative opposition has increasingly adopted the mantra of the extreme Right - Ich bin stolz ein Deutscher zu sein ('I'm proud to be German'). When Laurenz Meyer, general secretary of the opposition Christian Democrats (CDU}, used the phrase in a magazine interview he was accused of 'having the mentality of a skinhead' by Environment Minister J\u00fcrgen Trittin. The 70-year-old President, Johannes Rau, was caught up in the debate. Asked on TV whether he too was proud to be German, he said he was 'happy and grateful' to be German, but that he 'couldn't be proud of it'. He explained: 'One cannot be proud of something one has not achieved oneself. It is not an achievement to be German, simply luck.' Thomas Goppel, general secretary of the Bavarian Christian Social Union, said Germans should question whether Rau was patriotic enough to lead Germany. But Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der appeared to back his friend. 'I am proud of the achievements of people and of the democratic culture. In this sense I am a German patriot, who is proud of his country,' the Chancellor told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. Rau later tried to quell criticism by developing his ideas to say that he was 'proud of that which we have achieved in Germany since 1949 and after 1989', referring to the country's postwar rebuilding and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Fritz Kuhn, head of the government coalition partner, the Green Party, has accused the conservative opposition of trying to win the support of the far Right. But the political row is far more than a linguistic challenge about expressing love for the fatherland without using the forbidden phrase. The conservatives hope that it will help them to unseat the Social Democrats in today's elections in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. According to conservative politicians, the extreme right-wing German Nationalist Party (NPD) approached the CDU last week asking if it could join its election campaign to hand out its 'I'm proud to be German' stickers. The CDU refused the request. Christoph Boehr, standing for the conservatives, has asked voters to sign a petition calling for Trittin's resignation. 'He is totally indifferent to Germany's culture, history and identity,' he said. Schr\u00f6der angrily retorted: 'No one has a monopoly on patriotic beliefs.' He has called for a parliamentary debate on German patriotism which will take place in the Bundestag this week. The 'pride debate' is seen as the successor of a debate on German leitkultur - the high points of national culture which conservative politicians are keen that foreigners should study. In hardly any other country is national pride such a controversial topic as in Germany, with its difficult recent history. Newspapers concluded as much last week as they dedicated whole pages to patriotism around the world. They observed that it was a particularly bad time for British patriotism. The popular tabloid Bild concluded that the country had much to be proud of and a past for which it had responsibility. 'Germany has a rich cultural heritage and a varied past. It is our duty to carry the responsibility for this: for Goethe as well as for Hitler, for Gutenberg and Frederick the Great. We should defend our free, humane Germany and be really proud of it', the paper insisted. Commentators say the fact that Germany is holding the soul-searching debate at all is a sign of the democratic maturity of a country which less than six decades ago was ruled by a dictator. Although the assertion of national pride has become the motto of the Right, the Turkish-born Green MP, Cem \u00d6zdemir, has tried to invert it into a symbol of inclusiveness. His website shows images of a black German citizen wearing a T-shirt carrying the phrase Ich bin stolz... What's in ... Goethe; beer; Wagner; Casper David Friedrich; Seventies activists and Red Army memorabilia; Denglisch, a mix of German and English; Mercedes; Beethoven; Vegetarianism; Steffi Graf; Garden gnomes. And what's out German flag; German language; Boris Becker since his divorce; sausages; white socks; Tony Blair and 'Cool Britannia'; ageing footballers (ie the entire national team); folk music; talk shows.",

      "bodyText": "One crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name, said eighteenth century poet Thomas Mordaunt. Now his sentiment has been supported by a report which challenges the conventional wisdom that a longer life is a better life. According to Edward Diener, a social psychologist at the University of Illinois who carried out studies into what people wanted from life, most of those asked gave far more weight to how a life ended than to its duration. 'Respondents rated a wonderful life that ended abruptly as better than one with additional mildly pleasant years', a phenomenon Diener labels the 'James Dean effect' after the 24-year-old actor, who was killed in a car crash in 1955 and established the 'live fast, die young' ideal. The study found that a life ending abruptly after years of hardship and unhappiness was judged to be preferable to a life extended by additional, less difficult years. Diener calls that the 'Alexander Solzhenitsyn effect,' after the Russian writer who remained melancholy after moving to the West and leaving his years in a prison camp behind. According to Diener, best known for developing the Satisfaction With Life Scale, the findings run counter to the idea that longevity and life quality are inextricably linked. If he is right, then the common view that longevity is a key criterion for assessing the quality of a life will need to be reassessed. In the Illinois study, Diener and his colleagues asked their subjects to read and evaluate accounts of the life of a fictional woman named Jen. In one version, Jen's life was 'extremely happy, with enjoyable work, vacations, friends and pleasant leisure'. In another version, she was described as 'very depressed and angry, with a monotonous job, no close friends and leisure filled with solitary viewing of television'.

But new guidance from the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), part of the Financial Services Authority, should mean that insurance companies now have to spell out your other options when you ask about surrendering a policy. </p> <p>Under the new PIA guidance, consumers enquiring about surrender values on with-profits endowment policies should be told they can sell their policies as well. </p> <p>Policyholders can expect to receive on average 15 per cent more than the surrender value by selling the endowment policy to a traded endowment policy market maker, or by auctioning it.

      "bodyText": "Thinking about surrendering your endowment policy early in order to raise some extra cash? Before you do so, it is a worth exploring the other options- you may well get a better deal. Surrender values from insurance companies on endowments are notoriously poor. But new guidance from the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), part of the Financial Services Authority, should mean that insurance companies now have to spell out your other options when you ask about surrendering a policy. Under the new PIA guidance, consumers enquiring about surrender values on with-profits endowment policies should be told they can sell their policies as well. Policyholders can expect to receive on average 15 per cent more than the surrender value by selling the endowment policy to a traded endowment policy market maker, or by auctioning it. They stand to gain as much as 50 per cent more this way, according to market maker Policy Portfolio. But remember that market makers won't be interested in policies which have been in force for less than six years or have a surrender value of under \u00a32,000.

Indicators include reluctance on the part of first-time buyers to climb on to the ladder at what they think is the top of the market, and a reduction in the number of people applying for high income multiple loans in order to move into a bigger property. </p> <p>The UK economy is still doing very well and is not feeling the impact from the US economic slowdown yet according to the Halifax, Britain's biggest lender. Group economist Martin Ellis says: 'If things go into total meltdown then that will be different. But at the beginning of the year we predicted the housing market would grow by 4 per cent this year and we are sticking by that at the moment.' </p> <p>Reassuringly, Nationwide thinks the current situation is significantly different to that which led to the housing market crash of the early 1990s which left many homeowners with negative equity. </p> <p>The 1990s' crash happened for a number of reasons, says Nationwide's Bannister. The market was overblown - Bannister says it is nothing like as overvalued now - interest rates were running at 15 per cent, and the Chancellor gave people sharing a home six months to apply for dual tax relief in the 1988 Budget, causing a rush of borrowing. But many people could not keep up with their mortgage repayments. </p> <p>Nationwide believes its forecast of 7 per cent growth for the housing market this year is still on track. Bannister says: 'That won't change unless there is a recession and there is no sign of that - consumer spending was up 6 per cent year on year in February.' However, given that things could in theory take a turn for the worse, should you put off buying? </p> <p>Charles Levett-Scrivener of independent adviser Towry Law says people planning to stretch themselves should probably stay put, even if this means staying in rented accommodation. Fixed-rate mortgages may seem an attractive option if you want to fix outgoings on a tight budget, but mortgage rates are likely to fall, so it may be better to postpone a purchase. </p> <p>The CML says there is no reason to avoid the housing market, but just take precautions. Spokeswoman Sue Anderson says: 'Most people who have difficulties in paying the mortgage due to sickness or whatever come out of the situation quite quickly, but they have protection to tide them over in the meantime.' It recommends considering income protection or mortgage payment protection insurance cover.</p> <p>Buy-to-let lending has increased threefold since November according to Birmingham Midshires. But Mark Harris of Savills Private Finance warns that buy-to-let purchases are 'just as safe' as the stock market, no more and no less.</p>",

The UK economy is still doing very well and is not feeling the impact from the US economic slowdown yet according to the Halifax, Britain's biggest lender. Group economist Martin Ellis says: 'If things go into total meltdown then that will be different. But at the beginning of the year we predicted the housing market would grow by 4 per cent this year and we are sticking by that at the moment.' Reassuringly, Nationwide thinks the current situation is significantly different to that which led to the housing market crash of the early 1990s which left many homeowners with negative equity. The 1990s' crash happened for a number of reasons, says Nationwide's Bannister. The market was overblown - Bannister says it is nothing like as overvalued now - interest rates were running at 15 per cent, and the Chancellor gave people sharing a home six months to apply for dual tax relief in the 1988 Budget, causing a rush of borrowing. But many people could not keep up with their mortgage repayments. Nationwide believes its forecast of 7 per cent growth for the housing market this year is still on track. Bannister says: 'That won't change unless there is a recession and there is no sign of that - consumer spending was up 6 per cent year on year in February.' However, given that things could in theory take a turn for the worse, should you put off buying? Charles Levett-Scrivener of independent adviser Towry Law says people planning to stretch themselves should probably stay put, even if this means staying in rented accommodation. Fixed-rate mortgages may seem an attractive option if you want to fix outgoings on a tight budget, but mortgage rates are likely to fall, so it may be better to postpone a purchase. The CML says there is no reason to avoid the housing market, but just take precautions. Spokeswoman Sue Anderson says: 'Most people who have difficulties in paying the mortgage due to sickness or whatever come out of the situation quite quickly, but they have protection to tide them over in the meantime.' It recommends considering income protection or mortgage payment protection insurance cover. Buy-to-let lending has increased threefold since November according to Birmingham Midshires. But Mark Harris of Savills Private Finance warns that buy-to-let purchases are 'just as safe' as the stock market, no more and no less.",

In an organisation like ours it would be easy to exploit people because they work for the cause.

She says that while personal pensions are largely non-discriminatory (you can nominate your partner and organise payments accordingly), the state and most public sector schemes are not. </p> <p> 'With an NHS pension you can't make provision for your partner. They're trying to renegotiate the Civil Service scheme to make it useful for same-sex couples,' she says. 'The Government accepts the principle but is worried that it might cost a great deal - government actuaries say billions. But it can't cost that much.' </p> <p> Despite her professional interest in personal finance, Mason admits that she's hopeless, phobic even, about managing her own money.

I don't find money the most interesting thing in life.' </p> <p> An example of Mason's approach was when her daughter turned 16 recently and noticed she hadn't received a National Insurance card. It turned out to be because Mason hadn't claimed child benefit for three years. 'I just didn't notice I was no longer getting child benefit,' she says. </p> <p> But she does notice how the rules on child benefit work: 'Technically I'm treated as a single mother because my relationship with my partner isn't recognised. It's a small example of how the state loses out.'</p> <p> Although Mason confesses to a certain hubris - a feeling of being above it all - she doesn't object to her partner, an academic who's about to retire, organising her. </p> <p> 'She says to me: \"You like going on holiday so you have to save up and have a holiday fund.\" I know that if I organised it all better I could have more disposable income. I just don't respect money - it's all nonsense,' she says. </p> <p> However, she is committed to fighting financial injustices towards gay and lesbian couples - for example over inheritance tax. 'There is no recognition for same-sex partners if one of them dies,' she says. </p> <p> 'Because house prices have risen so dramatically, especially in London, a person may well have to sell their home to pay the inheritance tax.' </p> <p> As lesbian and gay adviser to London mayor Ken Livingstone, Mason will help set up a Partnership Register so that certain rights can be allocated to same-sex couples.</p>",

'Deep down I don't feel I deserve to have any money. I wouldn't mind if my salary was paid into a public pool and I was given an amount. I don't find money the most interesting thing in life.' An example of Mason's approach was when her daughter turned 16 recently and noticed she hadn't received a National Insurance card. It turned out to be because Mason hadn't claimed child benefit for three years. 'I just didn't notice I was no longer getting child benefit,' she says. But she does notice how the rules on child benefit work: 'Technically I'm treated as a single mother because my relationship with my partner isn't recognised. It's a small example of how the state loses out.' Although Mason confesses to a certain hubris - a feeling of being above it all - she doesn't object to her partner, an academic who's about to retire, organising her. 'She says to me: \"You like going on holiday so you have to save up and have a holiday fund.\" I know that if I organised it all better I could have more disposable income. I just don't respect money - it's all nonsense,' she says. However, she is committed to fighting financial injustices towards gay and lesbian couples - for example over inheritance tax. 'There is no recognition for same-sex partners if one of them dies,' she says. 'Because house prices have risen so dramatically, especially in London, a person may well have to sell their home to pay the inheritance tax.' As lesbian and gay adviser to London mayor Ken Livingstone, Mason will help set up a Partnership Register so that certain rights can be allocated to same-sex couples.",

Wednesday would mark Michael Page's return to the London Stock Exchange. The company was listed on the LSE between 1983 and 1997, before being gobbled up by Spherion.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When Sir Peter Davis stood up to address a City audience last summer, few of the assembled retailing experts were expecting anything more than a standard, depressing results announcement from J Sainsbury. </p> <p>Investors had got used to the litany of bad news from the erstwhile supermarket leader, which had fallen on hard times. Runaway costs, low margins, falling market share and profits had been on the menu at most such meetings over the previous few years. </p> <p>Davis, at the helm of the company where he had spent the formative years of his career, began by painting a familiar picture - a 23 per cent drop in profits and no dividend increase. But he then astounded his listeners by launching into a savage critique of Sainsbury's performance. </p> <p>The company infrastructure was years out of date, he said. The stores were old-fashioned, information technology and distribution systems were archaic and costs were higher than its competitors and showing no signs of coming down. It was, he said, the fault of the old management, which had under-invested in Sainsbury for decades and which had failed to keep pace with the retailing revolution forged by Tesco and Asda. Analysts left the meeting shocked and depressed at the summation. </p> <p>It was the commercial equivalent of the Russian premier Khrushchev's denunciation of the excesses of Stalinism in 1953, and Davis must have derived a certain amount of grim satisfaction from his performance. After all, he had left the company in 1986 convinced he would never get the top job because of opposition from the Sainsbury family, who were thought to be against appointing an outsider to it. Now he was back, with the family's full support. </p> <p>Davis is at the end of his first year back at Sainsbury, and must be quietly pleased at how things have gone since his return. The share price has recovered from the depths of around 240p to 376p on Friday. The City recognises that he has begun the job of tackling Sainsbury's problems in a three-year plan to restore the company to its former position as Britain's premier retailer. </p> <p>The strategy involves a rapid catch-up programme centred on Sainsbury's traditional strength: food retailing in the group's 440 stores. 'We have to make Sainsbury's special again,' explained a spokeswoman. 'We have to focus on the broad middle-market for quality food.' This would involve positioning the group's stores between Tesco's low-price strategy and the quality food of Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose. </p> <p>There is also a major refurbishment programme under way to give the ageing stores a facelift, as well as greater exploitation of Sainsbury's substantial commercial property portfolio. This includes the Nine Elms area in London's Vauxhall, which is being redeveloped as a commercial, retail and residential site. Sainsbury hopes this will be the model for several other sites around the country. The company also sees potential cost-saving in the move out of its old headquarters, on London's South Bank, to a new HQ near the City. </p> <p>Large amounts will be invested in information technology, which has been farmed out to consultants Accenture. The old regime had forecast that developing a new system would take eight years, but the company now believes it can be done in two. It has also released the cost of 1,100 jobs in distribution and elsewhere that helped keep the old system rattling along. All this innovation will cost around \u00a3200m a year for three years, partly funded by the \u00a31bn sale last year of Homebase. </p> <p>Outside food, Davis has stood back to rethink the strategy, but is now developing one in clothes with the recently launched Jeff &amp; Co range. A noticeable gap in the e-commerce sector has been filled by a deal with Carlton, and a move to sell wine with Oddbins. </p> <p>Outside the UK, Davis is persisting with the Shaws business in the US, which some in the market thought might slip onto the 'non-core' list. But there are signs that a disposal may happen in the long run. </p> <p>On the financial front, things are looking healthier since the Homebase sale. 'The medium-term aspiration is to stabilise the profits situation,' says a spokeswoman, but most analysts are forecasting a fall in profits for the year just about to end, even before taking into account the absence of any contribution from Homebase. </p> <p>The big challenge for Davis is still market share, which continues to compare badly with Asda and Tesco. There is a feeling that the company is beginning to turn this particular corner, but the City remains sceptical. </p> <p>A year into the Davis reconstruction of Sainsbury, there is a general feeling that he has made a good start, but there is a lot of work still to do. His next major move could well be crucial.</p>",

Davis, at the helm of the company where he had spent the formative years of his career, began by painting a familiar picture - a 23 per cent drop in profits and no dividend increase. But he then astounded his listeners by launching into a savage critique of Sainsbury's performance. The company infrastructure was years out of date, he said. The stores were old-fashioned, information technology and distribution systems were archaic and costs were higher than its competitors and showing no signs of coming down. It was, he said, the fault of the old management, which had under-invested in Sainsbury for decades and which had failed to keep pace with the retailing revolution forged by Tesco and Asda. Analysts left the meeting shocked and depressed at the summation. It was the commercial equivalent of the Russian premier Khrushchev's denunciation of the excesses of Stalinism in 1953, and Davis must have derived a certain amount of grim satisfaction from his performance. After all, he had left the company in 1986 convinced he would never get the top job because of opposition from the Sainsbury family, who were thought to be against appointing an outsider to it. Now he was back, with the family's full support. Davis is at the end of his first year back at Sainsbury, and must be quietly pleased at how things have gone since his return. The share price has recovered from the depths of around 240p to 376p on Friday. The City recognises that he has begun the job of tackling Sainsbury's problems in a three-year plan to restore the company to its former position as Britain's premier retailer. The strategy involves a rapid catch-up programme centred on Sainsbury's traditional strength: food retailing in the group's 440 stores. 'We have to make Sainsbury's special again,' explained a spokeswoman. 'We have to focus on the broad middle-market for quality food.' This would involve positioning the group's stores between Tesco's low-price strategy and the quality food of Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose. There is also a major refurbishment programme under way to give the ageing stores a facelift, as well as greater exploitation of Sainsbury's substantial commercial property portfolio. This includes the Nine Elms area in London's Vauxhall, which is being redeveloped as a commercial, retail and residential site. Sainsbury hopes this will be the model for several other sites around the country. The company also sees potential cost-saving in the move out of its old headquarters, on London's South Bank, to a new HQ near the City. Large amounts will be invested in information technology, which has been farmed out to consultants Accenture. The old regime had forecast that developing a new system would take eight years, but the company now believes it can be done in two. It has also released the cost of 1,100 jobs in distribution and elsewhere that helped keep the old system rattling along. All this innovation will cost around \u00a3200m a year for three years, partly funded by the \u00a31bn sale last year of Homebase. Outside food, Davis has stood back to rethink the strategy, but is now developing one in clothes with the recently launched Jeff &amp; Co range. A noticeable gap in the e-commerce sector has been filled by a deal with Carlton, and a move to sell wine with Oddbins. Outside the UK, Davis is persisting with the Shaws business in the US, which some in the market thought might slip onto the 'non-core' list. But there are signs that a disposal may happen in the long run. On the financial front, things are looking healthier since the Homebase sale. 'The medium-term aspiration is to stabilise the profits situation,' says a spokeswoman, but most analysts are forecasting a fall in profits for the year just about to end, even before taking into account the absence of any contribution from Homebase. The big challenge for Davis is still market share, which continues to compare badly with Asda and Tesco. There is a feeling that the company is beginning to turn this particular corner, but the City remains sceptical. A year into the Davis reconstruction of Sainsbury, there is a general feeling that he has made a good start, but there is a lot of work still to do. His next major move could well be crucial.",

It ignores the potential for exchange-rate movement (whether of a national currency or the euro). If a country's costs relative to others' are too high, its exchange rate eventually will fall, reducing those costs in international terms. That potential makes the idea that a country can be permanently, rather than temporarily, uncompetitive mistaken. </p> <p>Second, it assumes that higher taxes on labour (or tighter regulation), mean higher total labour costs.

There remain excellent arguments for limiting the size of the state, but these are rooted in liberal political philosophy, and in the fact that there are limits to public support for taxation, not in an externally given economic imperative. </p> <p>On regulation, we need to reject blanket talk of a competitiveness burden, and recognise that different regulations have different effects. Some labour market regulations - such as minimum wages set too high - create unemployment among unskilled workers, but they usually have no adverse effect on productivity, nor in the long term on export competitiveness. </p> <p>Indeed they can stimulate labour-saving investment, increasing productivity but at the expense of unemployment. France's high minimum wage probably destroyed low-paid jobs in supermarkets, but it has not stopped French exporting companies achieving productivity well above typical British levels. </p> <p>Europe in the last 20 years has grown in prosperity quite as fast as the US, and productivity more rapidly, but it has created fewer jobs, especially in sectors such as retailing. The case for more flexible labour markets in Europe is strong, but it rests mainly on the need for greater job creation in these untraded sectors of the economy and hardly on the demands of global competition. </p> <p>Environmental regulations conversely can impact on productivity, but rarely long-term employment: their effect is to divert resources to achieving environmental benefits rather than to producing goods and services, reducing private disposable incomes as a result. The demand for such regulation is, moreover, an expression of customer preference - the fact that as society gets richer, we value environmental improvement as much as more and cheaper goods. </p> <p>Public policy needs to choose between these different customer/social preferences, and to achieve maximum benefits at least cost. To do that governments should use the panoply of 'deregulation' or 'better regulation' task forces and techniques that have developed over the last decade.

So what did you do at the witching hour on Friday night? </p> <p>Perhaps you were quaffing radical South American cocktails such as the caipirinha at Soho House. But members of the 'Apple Mac community' gathered at a Tottenham Court Road computer showroom to celebrate its Second Coming - the arrival of Mac OS X, Apple's competitor to Microsoft's Windows software. </p> <p>And it's not just the legions of loyal 'Mac-heads' who have been waiting for the new operating system. Apple itself has suffered more than most from the softening US economy, and made clear strategic mistakes to boot. In the first quarter of its financial year (from October to December), it registered a loss of $247 million, its first since the return of founder Steve Jobs as CEO in 1997. After riding high for three years, Apple's share price tumbled last autumn, when sluggish performance was first revealed. At $21, it stands at less than half of September's level. </p> <p>This weekend's release of Mac OS X (the 'X' is a Roman numeral rather than a letter) crowns Apple's attempts to draw a line under recent problems and return to profitability in the current quarter. Operational measures, such as the halving of inventory held by distributors in Q1, supplemented the company's traditional focus on high-impact product announcements. The latest iMacs are adorned with a Madchester-style flower print and offers wannabe popstars and DJs the long overdue ability to record CDs. But Apple also leapfrogged its competitors by releasing a computer that will record DVD videos too. </p> <p>But these functions will be available on all PCs fairly soon. In Apple's view, it is the ease and reliability with which these functions operate together and connect to the outside world that will distinguish the Mac. And this is why they have been waiting 17 years for a new operating system. </p> <p>'Mac OS X is the most important software from Apple since the original Macintosh operating system in 1984 that revolutionised the entire industry,' says Jobs. </p> <p>'A plain way of explaining it is that OS X will be doing inside what the iMac has done on the outside. But it's more than that - it combines the stability with elegance and ease of use,' says Pascal Cagni, Apple's general manager in Europe. </p> <p>More than 100,000 Mac users tested an early version of the software. That process saved the much-loved 'Apple button' and clock from extinction. But the look and foundation of the new system have moved on in most other respects. The software is based on Unix, the industrial-strength operating system used by the Space Shuttle, the military and banks. But Aqua, the front-end, is much more human. </p> <p>Apple is getting back to basics, so they say, returning to what it has always been loved for - ease of use. The focus on aesthetics has not disappeared, but there was always going to be a limit. That appears to be the lesson from the flop of it's much-hyped Cube computer, which has sold fewer than 100,000 worldwide despite exciting the design-freaks. The Cube was launched at precisely the wrong time of the market, a few months after the Nasdaq crash, when corporate IT investment was being slashed and consumer demand was softening. Analysts said it was too expensive, and that Apple was going for style over substance. A summer switch to an internal sales force for its education market also played havoc with sales in a key market. And then there was the talk of recession in the US. </p> <p>'It gave us a very strong wake-up call. As we're a very positive company we said there were good aspects to this. Having had that first three years of turnaround success, it taught us to go back, to focus on strategy, and to change our core processes. We were obliged to look at the bigger picture, but we didn't change the 5 to 6 per cent we spend on research and development,' says Cagni. </p> <p>'We took a hit, and then cleaned up in the first quarter. We went out of Q1 with a very sound business situation. </p> <p>'Using the strength of our brand and our new product range, we are set for a good 2001. It's in hard times that you see where true strength lies,' he says. </p> <p>Sluggish consumer demand in Europe continues to worry . 'There's no question that the consumer side will be tougher, and that what's happening in the US is having some effect,' he says. </p> <p>Global market share is still less than 5 per cent worldwide. 'But we're still market leaders in the sectors where we play,' says Cagni. </p> <p>Apple has been telling investors that it will focus on these core areas - creative industries, design, education, and SoHo - not the place, but users who work in a Small office - Home office. </p> <p>But it is also busy chasing the markets of the future. While it might be known as the computer of choice for 1960s activists turned industrial creatives, there is a new target in sight. </p> <p>'The iMac is an icon of our current world. The point for us is to say we need to go after a different base of customers - and a younger audience,' he says. </p> <p>So they're going for the PlayStation and Gameboy generation, people who have been brought up with 'digital lifestyles', says Cagni. These are people with digital cameras, video cameras, MP3 players and mobile phones who need to link their gadgetry together and communicate their creations to the world. Apple wants to place its smart looking and easy to use machines as the 'digital hub' at the heart of the home. </p> <p>The problem is that this is what every respectable electronics manufacturer wants to do, not least Sony - the architect of the PlayStation generation.

Bill Gates' company is producing a new version of its Office software. </p> <p>There are already problems, however. Apple's advertising campaign for its latest iMacs flaunts the ability to mix, make music and then record onto CDs. But OS X users will not be allowed this until a fix is produced next month.

The best time to buy is when markets are at the bottom.

In the opinion of the more level-headed analysts, now may be a time to buy. </p> <p>Strategists point out, indeed, that equities have only been as cheap relative to gilts on seven occasions in the past 35 years. The highest returns come from individual stock selection, but that has the usual risks. Holders of index trackers will not, of course, have been in the money since the market peaked on New Year's Eve 1999. </p> <p>The millennium hangover has been going on since, but after the mayhem of last week now may well be the right time to invest in an equity index tracker product. </p> <p><strong> Iceland's spring</strong><br> </p> <p> Is the meltdown at Iceland over?

      "bodyText": "After the deluge, an equity life raft Clearly, this market is not for orphans and widows and nerves will be on edge for a few months yet to come. Through all of this, however, remember that in the long term equities outperform other investments. The best time to buy is when markets are at the bottom. The next best time is generally after a crash. Despite the 1987 horror, markets recovered reasonably quickly, as they did in 1998 after the Asian crisis and the shock of Russia's debt default. In the opinion of the more level-headed analysts, now may be a time to buy. Strategists point out, indeed, that equities have only been as cheap relative to gilts on seven occasions in the past 35 years. The highest returns come from individual stock selection, but that has the usual risks. Holders of index trackers will not, of course, have been in the money since the market peaked on New Year's Eve 1999. The millennium hangover has been going on since, but after the mayhem of last week now may well be the right time to invest in an equity index tracker product. Iceland's spring Is the meltdown at Iceland over? Broker Schroders Salomon Smith Barney seems to think so. With a price target of 200p for the shares, against 160p now, it is strongly backing the new management, headed by ex-Wickes chief Bill Grimsey. All the bad news is, SSSB believes, out of the way, and strategically Iceland must return to its low-price, innovative heritage. The Booker merger offers scope to lift penetration of the \u00a320 billion-a-year wholesale market and the food service catering sector. Grimsey, who used to be at Tesco, has recruited a number of heavyweight new managers, including former Wickes finance director Bill Hoskins. Iceland's next big chance to impress investors will be at Grimsey's growth strategy presentation in June. After falling off a cliff this year, SSSB believes the shares are now overdue for a recovery.

Science knowhow It's a brave or foolhardy person who looks at anything hi-tech, let alone e-commerce, in this panicky market. However, AIM-quoted software specialist Science Systems may be one to watch. The firm is expected to report record results on Thursday and give an upbeat assessment of current trading.

Staff shortages and high accommodation costs mean that more and more health trusts will have to offer affordable housing to attract staff. Unite already operates in this market in London, through a joint venture with Peabody Trust, and last year signed a deal with Gateshead NHS Trust, its first outside the capital. </p> <p>The financial results are impressive.

Organisers of the cross-party 'No' campaign are seeking donors in the hope that, if they corner the money, they could stop Conservative Central Office taking over the campaign. The ginger group is hoping for celebrity endorsements that it fears could be lost if stars have to share platforms with embarrassingly fervent right-wingers - or even with Hague himself. 'We know that Number 10 is counting on the Tories taking over the campaign once it starts and frankly screwing it up,' said one senior source in the 'No' group, formed from the merger of the Business for Sterling and New Europe groups. 'We don't want to let that happen and we are trying to work out now how to stop it.' Strategists at Conservative Central Office had proved 'shockingly incompetent' at running their own affairs and should not be allowed to take over something so important, the source added.

The 'No' group is determined to distance itself from right-wingers it regards as offputting to the public, such as former Minister John Redwood and the arch-Eurosceptic backbencher Bill Cash, and from an emphasis on sovereignty and the flag. It also hopes that, by severing ties with Central Office, it can attract more of the rump of anti-euro Labour MPs and portray itself as genuinely cross-party. There have been disagreements over tactics with Central Office over how far the line should be hardened, or whether the Tories should have promised a referendum on the euro as well as Blair, a bold move that would have indicated their confidence of winning.

The UKPG 2000 Press Awards dinner, the self-styled Oscars of journalism, was not as good as usual, it was suggested. Many thought it the dullest ceremony for years and part of the blame was laid at the door of comp\u00e8re Michael Parkinson, at his most dour and Yorkshire, with admonitions to 'Shut up at the back,' and 'Only come up on stage if you've won something.' Philippa Kennedy, the UKPG editor who organised the event, was unashamed: 'I thought it was a better evening. More restrained, yes, but more dignified.

      "bodyText": "Dour slammed Even allowing for morning after syndrome, some hacks were pretty unhappy following the glittering bash at the Park Lane Hilton. The UKPG 2000 Press Awards dinner, the self-styled Oscars of journalism, was not as good as usual, it was suggested. Many thought it the dullest ceremony for years and part of the blame was laid at the door of comp\u00e8re Michael Parkinson, at his most dour and Yorkshire, with admonitions to 'Shut up at the back,' and 'Only come up on stage if you've won something.' Philippa Kennedy, the UKPG editor who organised the event, was unashamed: 'I thought it was a better evening. More restrained, yes, but more dignified. We had something to be proud of, and it deserved a different level of seriousness, and Parkinson was the man to do that.' He certainly was.

      "byline": "Amy Lawrence",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Jim Smith must be the most superstitious man in football. Matchday routine involves same lucky clothes (right down to his underpants), same pennies in his pockets, same morning walk down to the paper shop, same route to the ground listening to the same music...Fat lot of good it did him at the beginning of the season, when a hopeless run left Derby County stranded at the foot of the Premiership and without a single win to their name as winter set in. </p> <p>Over the years Smith has inspired as much affection as admiration in football circles, yet even his staunchest allies were beginning to fear for his future at Pride Park. And so was he. In such bleak moments it's not unusual to resort to calling for divine inspiration. Little did Smith know a miracle would be sent in the remarkable form of Taribo West.</p> <p>He describes his inimitable Nigerian defender as the catalyst, the key factor behind Derby's ascent from the relegation zone. 'Obviously if you get so far behind there's a mountain to climb. In all honesty, I don't think we'd have done it without Taribo. He has been the major, major player.' Colin Todd's homecoming as first-team coach has been important, as has the reduction of a destructive injury list which deprived Derby of the experience of Craig Burley, Darryl Powell, Horacio Carbonari, Georgi Kinkladze and Branko Strupar in the opening months, but West gets the biggest vote of thanks. Charismatic, crucial, he's become the Cantona of Derby. </p> <p>Before West had even signed on loan from AC Milan, the mere possibility created enough of a stir to revive their battered confidence. 'He came over to see if he had a feel for the place and had an immediate effect,' recalls Smith. 'We were playing Norwich in the League Cup and he walked round the dressing room before the game. The lads were saying, \"Ah, he won't sign,\" but in fairness he did get them a bit excited because he's a character and an international player with a history of great clubs. We went out and won 3-0.' After much wrangling with his agent - which resulted in West becoming the best-paid player on County's books - he signed and exerted even greater influence.</p> <p>One off, as far as Smith is concerned, is a mighty understatement. Naturally the Bald Eagle is mystified by probably the most eccentric hairstyle in world football. But beyond the superficial, it is West's religious fervour which has proved the biggest culture shock for a manager so traditional he turned up for work in his flat cap before proceeding to drink about 20 mugs of tea. He's got used to the star-struck followings that are attracted by the modern player, but the fact that West gave a sermon in London to a 2,000-strong congregation last week is something else entirely. 'He's totally different from anything I've ever known,' Smith chuckles. 'He prays in the showers, he prays in the canteen, he prays in this room and that room. Every weekend he goes to Milan to preach in his church but he's always back for Tuesday morning training.' </p> <p>One can imagine the potential for friction in an English dressing room, given it is hardly the most tolerant environment for people who are atypical, afforded special treatment, or announce themselves by avowing: 'Where there is blackness we can bring light'. The lads at Derby, however, overlook all that because of what West brings to the team. 'He's an outstanding defender, very aggressive. And it's not as if he's swanning off to Milan to go nightclubbing and shopping, he goes for his church,' says Smith. 'It's not been a problem but I can envisage it might be if we signed him long term. I'd like to keep him in spite of all the baggage that comes with him.'</p> <p>Retaining his playing staff is a sore point at the moment for a football man as qualified as Smith. One would have thought last Thursday's transfer deadline day would have been a good opportunity for him to strengthen his squad, just to guard against any unnerving hitches in the run-in (they are on the up but not yet in the clear). Instead, he found the board were far keener to sell than buy. Derby are in debt. They have a crop of talented youngsters which could be swapped for a few million and easy money cannot be sniffed at. </p> <p>Smith is doing his utmost to persuade the board to find other solutions because he believes his kids can flourish. He is proud of the fact that the team who drew at Anfield in Derby's last outing contained six players aged 22 and under. 'We had a rocky start to the season but on the other side of the coin kids have come in and blossomed. The likes of Chris Riggott, Malcolm Christie and young Adam Murray have come out of it as better players, players who have gone through a really hard time and have that desire to do well.' Then, he adds a warning note: 'The signs are very promising but the financial side is not promising so I don't know what will happen.' Maintaining a bright, healthy squad is as much of an incentive for the rest of the campaign as ensuring relegation is avoided (three more points, he reckons, should do it). Because the higher you finish, the greater the bonus money you earn from the Premier League. 'That extra three or four places could make the difference between having to sell somebody or holding onto them,' Smith remarks. One thing is sure, he won't let them go without a fight. He checks the local paper to confirm that Derby's reserve team have top spot in their grasp - more proof of the club's potential - and sips his umpteenth tea from his special mug, on which gold letters spell out 'The Boss'. With a little help from Taribo there is plenty of life in the old eagle yet.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jim Smith must be the most superstitious man in football. Matchday routine involves same lucky clothes (right down to his underpants), same pennies in his pockets, same morning walk down to the paper shop, same route to the ground listening to the same music...Fat lot of good it did him at the beginning of the season, when a hopeless run left Derby County stranded at the foot of the Premiership and without a single win to their name as winter set in. Over the years Smith has inspired as much affection as admiration in football circles, yet even his staunchest allies were beginning to fear for his future at Pride Park. And so was he. In such bleak moments it's not unusual to resort to calling for divine inspiration. Little did Smith know a miracle would be sent in the remarkable form of Taribo West. He describes his inimitable Nigerian defender as the catalyst, the key factor behind Derby's ascent from the relegation zone. 'Obviously if you get so far behind there's a mountain to climb. In all honesty, I don't think we'd have done it without Taribo. He has been the major, major player.' Colin Todd's homecoming as first-team coach has been important, as has the reduction of a destructive injury list which deprived Derby of the experience of Craig Burley, Darryl Powell, Horacio Carbonari, Georgi Kinkladze and Branko Strupar in the opening months, but West gets the biggest vote of thanks. Charismatic, crucial, he's become the Cantona of Derby. Before West had even signed on loan from AC Milan, the mere possibility created enough of a stir to revive their battered confidence. 'He came over to see if he had a feel for the place and had an immediate effect,' recalls Smith. 'We were playing Norwich in the League Cup and he walked round the dressing room before the game. The lads were saying, \"Ah, he won't sign,\" but in fairness he did get them a bit excited because he's a character and an international player with a history of great clubs. We went out and won 3-0.' After much wrangling with his agent - which resulted in West becoming the best-paid player on County's books - he signed and exerted even greater influence. One off, as far as Smith is concerned, is a mighty understatement. Naturally the Bald Eagle is mystified by probably the most eccentric hairstyle in world football. But beyond the superficial, it is West's religious fervour which has proved the biggest culture shock for a manager so traditional he turned up for work in his flat cap before proceeding to drink about 20 mugs of tea. He's got used to the star-struck followings that are attracted by the modern player, but the fact that West gave a sermon in London to a 2,000-strong congregation last week is something else entirely. 'He's totally different from anything I've ever known,' Smith chuckles. 'He prays in the showers, he prays in the canteen, he prays in this room and that room. Every weekend he goes to Milan to preach in his church but he's always back for Tuesday morning training.' One can imagine the potential for friction in an English dressing room, given it is hardly the most tolerant environment for people who are atypical, afforded special treatment, or announce themselves by avowing: 'Where there is blackness we can bring light'. The lads at Derby, however, overlook all that because of what West brings to the team. 'He's an outstanding defender, very aggressive. And it's not as if he's swanning off to Milan to go nightclubbing and shopping, he goes for his church,' says Smith. 'It's not been a problem but I can envisage it might be if we signed him long term. I'd like to keep him in spite of all the baggage that comes with him.' Retaining his playing staff is a sore point at the moment for a football man as qualified as Smith. One would have thought last Thursday's transfer deadline day would have been a good opportunity for him to strengthen his squad, just to guard against any unnerving hitches in the run-in (they are on the up but not yet in the clear). Instead, he found the board were far keener to sell than buy. Derby are in debt. They have a crop of talented youngsters which could be swapped for a few million and easy money cannot be sniffed at. Smith is doing his utmost to persuade the board to find other solutions because he believes his kids can flourish. He is proud of the fact that the team who drew at Anfield in Derby's last outing contained six players aged 22 and under. 'We had a rocky start to the season but on the other side of the coin kids have come in and blossomed. The likes of Chris Riggott, Malcolm Christie and young Adam Murray have come out of it as better players, players who have gone through a really hard time and have that desire to do well.' Then, he adds a warning note: 'The signs are very promising but the financial side is not promising so I don't know what will happen.' Maintaining a bright, healthy squad is as much of an incentive for the rest of the campaign as ensuring relegation is avoided (three more points, he reckons, should do it). Because the higher you finish, the greater the bonus money you earn from the Premier League. 'That extra three or four places could make the difference between having to sell somebody or holding onto them,' Smith remarks. One thing is sure, he won't let them go without a fight. He checks the local paper to confirm that Derby's reserve team have top spot in their grasp - more proof of the club's potential - and sips his umpteenth tea from his special mug, on which gold letters spell out 'The Boss'. With a little help from Taribo there is plenty of life in the old eagle yet.",

      "body": "<p>The cafes beneath the Qemal Stafa Stadium - where England play Albania on Wednesday - are among the nicest places in Tirana. Sitting on the terrace of Bar Champion, drinking excellent frothy cappuccinos in the morning sun, you can imagine you are in Italy. This is in fact extremely easy to imagine, because both the stadium and the Fascist-looking square in front of it were built by the Italian Fascists. </p> <p>Fifty yards along from Bar Champion, a dead rat lies on its back, paws in the air as if it has been shot (which perhaps it has). Just past the rat, in another of the stadium's cafes, the Albanian manager, Mehdi Zhega, sits with his mates over glasses of early-morning raki. </p> <p>So mellow is the mood around the stadium that it is hard to believe that a few months ago two men were murdered in one of these cafes. Nor does it seem feasible that the stadium's director was sentenced to 22 years in jail in 1996 for crimes against humanity. Mehdi Bushati fled to Syria, returned home when the Socialist Party was elected, and is now an establishment figure again. He was the English FA's guest at West Ham-Tottenham recently. </p> <p>For 45 years, Albania was the most isolated country in Europe. Football was virtually the only sign Albanians got that the outside world existed. People would risk jail sentences to listen to Italian football on the radio, or to the Saturday afternoon games on the BBC World Service, and every now and then a foreign team would arrive from another universe. In no other country in Europe did football mean so much. </p> <p>Ten years ago this week, the Communist regime held elections and Albania changed forever. But when the England team check into the Hotel Rogner on Tirana's main boulevard tomorrow, they will still be entering a football nation unlike any other. </p> <p>Like almost everything else, football came to Albania late. A Maltese priest brought a ball to the northern town of Shkodra, where Albania's first football club was founded in 1919. But until World War Two, football remained largely a game for upper-class boys. The matches at Tirana's only football ground were often refereed by a British major called Hill, or 'Hilly', a policeman in Albania's gendarmerie and a favourite local character. </p> <p>Work on a national stadium was begun under King Zog in 1938 and completed by Italian soldiers during the war. The Qemal Stafa Stadium opened in 1946 with the Balkan Cup, which Albania won - the country's only trophy until last year's triumph in a tournament on Malta. </p> <p>Football quickly became fantastically popular in Albania. There was simply nothing else to do. There was hardly even anything else to talk about. Almost the only interesting conversation Albanians could have without the risk of being denounced to the Sigurimi, the secret police, was about football. Any big European match would be debated endlessly in the country's schools, communal farms and concrete army bunkers. Albanians became the world's nerdiest football fans. </p> <p>Friends would get together in secret to listen to matches on the BBC or Italian radio. You could go to jail for this - the regime believed that the BBC was sending coded messages to spies in Albania - but hardly anyone ever did. The government needed football because the game kept people off the streets. Even today you can find Albanians who can recite whole stretches of BBC commentary from forgotten matches of the Sixties, or enumerate the substitutes of the great Liverpool side of the Seventies. It is a sadness to many Albanians that their hero Kevin Keegan is no longer England manager. </p> <p>By the 1980s, Albanians were attending more football matches per capita than any other Europeans. The state firms where they worked would often give them tickets. The national team was even more popular, at least when it was allowed to play. Albania grew even more isolated from the world as Enver Hoxha, the dictator, decided that first Yugoslavia, then the USSR and finally even China had gone soft. The country would occasionally boycott World Cups and European championships, and in one seven-year period in the 1970s played just one match. Foreign visits were always tense. When Ajax arrived to play Dynamo Tirana in the early Seventies, the border guards apparently asked to cut the visitors' hair. </p> <p>England's only other visit to Tirana was in 1989. People came from all over in donkey carts to watch - 'The whole of Shkoder was in Tirana,' one woman recalls - and one man claims to have sold his ticket for the lek equivalent of $300. At training sessions before the match, guarded by the Sigurimi, Paul Gascoigne joked with the Albanian crowd. Besnik Dizdari, Albania's football historian, showed me the photograph he took of the England team before kick-off: Bryan Robson, Peter Shilton, John Barnes and Gary Lineker looking as if they had no idea they were visiting Europe's strangest state. They won 2-0. </p> <p>The revolution transformed Albanian football. Under Communism, Dynamo Tirana (team of the Sigurimi) and Partizan Tirana (the army club) won all the prizes. Afterwards they faltered. Partizan actually dropped to the second division last season, even though their team features several Brazilians (at least, they say they're Brazilians; the suspicion is that they are local gypsies). Meanwhile SK Tirana (17 Nentori Tirana in Communist times) have become the coun try's pre-eminent side, backed by an Egyptian magnate with the resonant name of El-Sayed. Symbolically, SK now play in the Dynamo Stadium, Albania's finest club ground even if at last weekend's match there was a slaughtered sheep tied to the railings. </p> <p>However, few Albanians care any longer. Like all other Eastern Europeans, they stopped going to football matches after Communism fell. </p> <p>There were other things to do, and no point any longer in cheering on little teams against Partizan or Dynamo. Albanian TV stations now steal footage of English or Italian matches from foreign stations, and people watch that instead of going to games. They also pirate merchandise: in one slum I saw a boy wearing a Michael Owen shirt, and another in a top that said 'Nike Umbro'. Milan shirts are dead common. Most importantly, at kiosks all over town, or in the MBA Sport bar beneath the Opera in Skanderbeg Square, you can bet on Italian football matches. </p> <p>If you ask people who they support, it's never Tirana or Partizan, but always Milan, Juventus or Lazio, although there is an Inter magazine in Albanian. The most popular English clubs used to be Liverpool and Chelsea, the latter because of the Italian connection. However, in the words of one Albanian football fan: 'Manchester is becoming popular with the little children. In the area where I live I see many of them wearing Manchester shirts.' </p> <p>Albanian footballers have deserted the domestic game. About 320 of them play abroad, part of the exodus of more than half a million Albanians since the fall of Communism. No Albanian has become a genuine star, but the experience of playing in stronger leagues has lifted individual standards and strengthened the national team. Perhaps the country's best player is Rudi Vata, a centre-back who had a spell at Celtic, is now at Energie Cottbus in Germany, and currently features on the cover of the Albanian picture magazine XXL with his blonde Glaswegian wife, Anne. </p> <p>Another star of sorts is Igli Tare, a 6ft 6in albino centre-forward with Brescia, who is, according to a British diplomat, 'the spitting image of Iain Dowie'. </p> <p>Crowds at Albanian domestic matches have dropped from an average of 6,000 to fewer than 2,000. With nobody watching, strange things have begun to happen. Last season, a tiny club named Tomori Berat made a run for the title. In a crucial game against Partizan, they won 1-0. That left them neck-and-neck with SK Tirana with one game left. </p> <p>It was then that gunmen walked into one of the cafes under the National Stadium and shot dead the Tomori president and Albania's best-known referee. The league was temporarily suspended. Tomori won their last match, 3-1, to earn a play-off for the title with SK. They lost on penalties. </p> <p>Crdling his Raki last week, national coach Zhega had worries that western managers could not imagine. First, there was the risk he would not be allowed into Germany for yesterday's match. In the 1990s, he was briefly a Socialist Party deputy, and after hitting a spot of political bother he fled to Germany. </p> <p>Apparently he didn't do this entirely legally, because the Germans were hesitant about giving him a visa. Zhega denies everything. 'I never lived in Germany, although I have been there many times,' he says in fluent German. </p> <p>Eventually his visa was arranged. Then something else came up: a midfielder named Clirim Bashi claimed last week that Zhega had left him out of the squad because Bashi would not give him \u00a33,500. This seems to be something of a new Albanian custom: there are a lot of young men in Tirana who will tell you: 'I could have been a pro, but I couldn't afford the bribe.' </p> <p>Whatever the truth, Zhega is a charming man with a nice smile. 'In Albania we have no Manchester United, no Leeds, no Newcastle,' he reveals. He has been mugging up on English football with a Match of the Day video borrowed from Neil Roberts, a British diplomat in Tirana. ('But it was the third round of the FA Cup,' says Roberts, 'with matches like Charlton-Dagenham and Bolton-Yeovil, so I don't think he'll find it much use.') </p> <p>The British Embassy has worries of its own. About 1,300 English fans are expected in Tirana, the largest foreign contingent ever to attend a football match here. If they get drunk and abuse passing women or urinate on statues, they could get into unprecedented trouble. </p> <p>'If something kicks off in Albania, there will be guns coming out,' a British expat in Tirana warns gloomily. 'Like throwing a plastic chair at a car - in Belgium you'll get away with it. But here you'll probably get a bullet in the head.' </p> <p>The concept of male honour is strong in Albania. Telling a man's wife to 'get your tits out for the lads' is risky in a country where 670,000 weapons were looted from the state armouries in the Pyramid Revolution of 1997. </p> <p>The FA is hoping to solve at least one of the problems by flying in Portaloos. The good news is that in the history of Albanian football there has never yet been a hooligan episode. </p> <p>It would be sad if the England fans misbehaved, because Britain has a very good reputation in Albania.

But George Best, the football star regarded as one of the best players the world has ever seen, has begun drinking heavily again - and has told friends he would rather die than stay on the wagon.</p> <p>The 54-year-old former Manchester United star, who has been largely teetotal since collapsing and almost dying with liver failure last year, resumed drinking early last week with what friends call 'a triple bender' and has been defying warnings from his wife, Alex, that he could end up killing himself.</p> <p>He participated in one heavy drinking session last Monday and continued consuming large amounts of alcohol throughout the week. He was seen drinking in pubs in Ballyhalbert and Donaghadee, near his home on the Ards peninsula, near Belfast. Best moved to Northern Ireland last year to escape the temptations of drink offered by his social life in London.</p> <p>Friends say he has decided to continue drinking, even if that costs him his life, and has given up his on-off policy of abstinence. They said he was resigned to dying and would rather enjoy the rest of his life by continuing to drink. Friends and relations are now fearing the worst.</p> <p>Phil Hughes, Best's agent, said last night: 'There have been rumours that George is back drinking again and unfortunately it's true. He's been poorly. He's had a couple of drinks in the last few days. It may have been as early as last Monday that he began drinking again. It's all very worrying, given all the warnings he had last year about what could happen to him if he did drink.'</p> <p>Hughes said Best had 'not been 100 per cent right' since he got out of hospital in Belfast last month after being treated for pneumonia. 'He's been weak and in a delicate condition. But my main concern is [that] he's had a few drinks. He hasn't been to hospital for a check-up in the last week, so I can't tell you exactly how he is.'</p> <p>The news will sadden Best's friends, relatives, former teammates and his legion of fans, who remember his starring role in Matt Busby's celebrated Manchester United team of the late 1960s.</p> <p>Best's combination of smouldering looks, extravagant talent and love of the high life turned him into football's first real superstar. But he retired in the mid-1970s, disillusioned with the game, and turned to drink.</p> <p>Best pulled out of commentating for the BBC on Northern Ireland's World Cup qualifier against the Czech Republic in Belfast yesterday, saying he was too ill to fulfil the engagement.</p> <p>'He's been taken ill again after he had a few bevvies last week. He just went off the rails a wee bit,' another friend explained. 'He still looks a bit rough these days, despite having sworn off the drink. The problem is that his immune system is gone. He's been trying to keep off the drink, and he'd been doing very well until this.'</p> <p>Professor Roger Williams, the liver specialist who began treating Best early last year, warned him at the time that even one glass of wine could finish him. At the time the soccer star vowed never to touch alcohol again.</p> <p>Williams said yesterday he hoped Best's lapse would not prove too serious and that he would go back to being teetotal. 'George has from time to time gone back on the drink since he gave up drinking last year.</p> <p>'There have been episodic bouts of drinking. But he has also stopped for long spells and not drunk for lengthy periods. He's very determined to stop any lapses, and has done very well, but this is what happens with people - they do have lapses from time to time.'</p> <p>Illness also forced Best to pull out of a dinner in his honour at Old Trafford 10 days ago, due to be the first of a series of fundraisers he planned to undertake to raise funds for research into alcohol-related liver disease.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:denis.campbell@observer.co.uk\">denis.campbell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

But George Best, the football star regarded as one of the best players the world has ever seen, has begun drinking heavily again - and has told friends he would rather die than stay on the wagon. The 54-year-old former Manchester United star, who has been largely teetotal since collapsing and almost dying with liver failure last year, resumed drinking early last week with what friends call 'a triple bender' and has been defying warnings from his wife, Alex, that he could end up killing himself. He participated in one heavy drinking session last Monday and continued consuming large amounts of alcohol throughout the week. He was seen drinking in pubs in Ballyhalbert and Donaghadee, near his home on the Ards peninsula, near Belfast. Best moved to Northern Ireland last year to escape the temptations of drink offered by his social life in London. Friends say he has decided to continue drinking, even if that costs him his life, and has given up his on-off policy of abstinence. They said he was resigned to dying and would rather enjoy the rest of his life by continuing to drink. Friends and relations are now fearing the worst. Phil Hughes, Best's agent, said last night: 'There have been rumours that George is back drinking again and unfortunately it's true. He's been poorly. He's had a couple of drinks in the last few days. It may have been as early as last Monday that he began drinking again. It's all very worrying, given all the warnings he had last year about what could happen to him if he did drink.' Hughes said Best had 'not been 100 per cent right' since he got out of hospital in Belfast last month after being treated for pneumonia. 'He's been weak and in a delicate condition. But my main concern is [that] he's had a few drinks. He hasn't been to hospital for a check-up in the last week, so I can't tell you exactly how he is.' The news will sadden Best's friends, relatives, former teammates and his legion of fans, who remember his starring role in Matt Busby's celebrated Manchester United team of the late 1960s. Best's combination of smouldering looks, extravagant talent and love of the high life turned him into football's first real superstar. But he retired in the mid-1970s, disillusioned with the game, and turned to drink. Best pulled out of commentating for the BBC on Northern Ireland's World Cup qualifier against the Czech Republic in Belfast yesterday, saying he was too ill to fulfil the engagement. 'He's been taken ill again after he had a few bevvies last week. He just went off the rails a wee bit,' another friend explained. 'He still looks a bit rough these days, despite having sworn off the drink. The problem is that his immune system is gone. He's been trying to keep off the drink, and he'd been doing very well until this.' Professor Roger Williams, the liver specialist who began treating Best early last year, warned him at the time that even one glass of wine could finish him. At the time the soccer star vowed never to touch alcohol again. Williams said yesterday he hoped Best's lapse would not prove too serious and that he would go back to being teetotal. 'George has from time to time gone back on the drink since he gave up drinking last year. 'There have been episodic bouts of drinking. But he has also stopped for long spells and not drunk for lengthy periods. He's very determined to stop any lapses, and has done very well, but this is what happens with people - they do have lapses from time to time.' Illness also forced Best to pull out of a dinner in his honour at Old Trafford 10 days ago, due to be the first of a series of fundraisers he planned to undertake to raise funds for research into alcohol-related liver disease. denis.campbell@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Sven-Goran Eriksson's reign in competitive matches got off to a winning start as England picked up their first win in Group Nine, but only after the new manager had suffered the shock of going behind against Finland. </p> <p>For a short while in the first half it looked as if Eriksson's positive approach would be undone by familiar failings as Gary Neville diverted an innocuous header past his own goalkeeper, but David Beckham helped England restore parity by half time - setting up scorer Michael Owen - and the captain supplied the winner himself early in the second half. </p> <p>Eriksson guards his team selections as closely as any of his predecessors - asked in advance if there would be any surprises in his line-up, he replied with a laconic, 'Not for me' - but in the event there were no surprises for anyone. With David Seaman and Steven Gerrard passed fit after their back problems, the team was the one everyone had been predicting, with Chris Powell and Steve McMana man on the left, Michael Owen operating just behind Andy Cole up front, and no one playing out of position. </p> <p>Strictly speaking, England were not supposed to be looking for an early goal, but playing a patient game, keeping their shape and trusting to their quality and pace. They almost had a goal in the very first minute, however, when Hannu Tihinen coughed up the ball immediately after dispossessing Owen, and Cole's snap-shot from the edge of the area rolled a couple of feet wide. </p> <p>A goal at that stage would have settled Cole and England down wonderfully, but they dropped into their short passing game soon enough, with only Gerrard and Ferdinand complicating matters by attempting over-ambitious crossfield balls, which gifted possession to the Finns. A delightfully weighted pass down the left by McManaman sent Owen to the by-line after six minutes, though the cross was disappointing. Cole managed to play Owen into the penalty area three minutes later but penalty appeals for a crude challenge from Tihinen were turned down. England had started brightly enough, but the Cole-Owen combination was failing to trouble Tihinen and Sami Hyypia in the centre of the Finland defence. </p> <p>When Paul Scholes began hoisting long balls from the centre circle in the general direction of Cole it was a sure indication that the midfield-strikers link was not functioning. Another was that both England's best efforts in the first 42 minutes were shots from Beckham from well outside the area. Antii Niemi saved the first one comfortably, and was relieved to see the second fly over his bar from 30 yards out. But though the captain's determination to lead by example could not be faulted, one had the feeling Finland would be happy to watch Beckham shooting from distance all day. </p> <p>They certainly would once Finland took an unexpected lead after 26 minutes. Unexpected because, apart from a speculative lob by Jari Litmanen that caused Seaman only the briefest alarm, Finland had not shown much interest in scoring. Their game-plan must have been the same as England's, just to hold their shape and take what chances might arrive. But when they took their very first opportunity, it was almost a San Marino moment. </p> <p>Gary Neville was twice involved, first by needlessly conceding a corner under no particular pressure, then by deflecting a header past Sea man with his knee after England had failed to pick up Aki Rihilahti from Kolkka's cross from the left. </p> <p>It almost got worse for England when the splendid Litmanen fed Jonatan Johansson five minutes before the interval. The Charlton striker held off Ferdinand and got a shot on target, but Seaman dived to his right to save. Just as it seemed Eriksson's first half-time team talk would be a despondent one, he was rescued by the sheer determination of his captain. </p> <p>Turning up in the centre of midfield and taking the situation into his own hands in the same way as he had when scoring a consolation goal against Real Madrid last year, Beckham ran at Finland and found Neville on the overlap to his right. The full-back did well to ride a challenge and reach the by-line, but though his driven low cross was hit too firmly for Cole to control, the ball eventually reached Owen, who lashed it left-footed past Niemi, again with the aid of a deflection. </p> <p>England never looked back once Beckham had shown the way, and further direct running rewarded the captain with a goal just four minutes into the second half. This time it was McManaman who engaged Finland's defence, running as freely through central midfield as he does for his club before slipping the ball to his right to Scholes, who instantly moved it right again to give his team-mate a clear view of goal. Beckham needed no further invitation, and from the way he power-swerved the ball past a helpless Niemi, his prowess as a finisher has been underestimated. His second goal for England and his first from open play could hardly have come at a better time, and never could Beckham have expected to be cheered so heartily by an Anfield crowd. </p> <p>Finland responded by playing three in attack with Litmanen as a one-man midfield, in which capacity he brought a save from Seaman in the 66th minute. England should have wrapped up the game before that, not from the Owen header that came back off Niemi's upright but from the Cole header that preceded it. With the whole of the goal available to break his international duck, Cole succeeded only in unintentionally teeing up his team-mate. </p> <p>All too typically, Cole came up with an even more glaring miss in the 73rd minute. Played clean through by a deft touch from Scholes, Cole took aim from eight yards and sent the crispest of strikes straight into the Kop. Perhaps Eriksson now understands why he keeps having to field questions about Cole's international pedigree, though he wisely refrained from withdrawing the striker until near the end. </p> <p>When Emile Heskey came on for the last 15 minutes he replaced McManaman, a switch that drew the only boos of the afternoon. Heskey had obviously been given instruction to run at the opposition, and did so to such good effect with his first touch that Hyypia was obliged to bring him down on the edge of the area, Beckham's free kick bringing a diving save from Niemi. </p> <p>Cole was eventually replaced by Robbie Fowler, who brought another save from Niemi before the end, but Finland would have had an equaliser if it hadn't been for a remarkable point-blank save by Seaman when Litmanen seemed certain to score from Shefki Kuqi's left-wing cross. It was quite a narrow squeak in the end, which ultimately may be no bad thing. England have the points they need - Eriksson knows there is room, and need, for improvement.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Talk to anyone about the British obsession with their homes and sooner or later they will trot out the saying: 'An Englishman's home is his castle.' It is a clich\u00e9 that speaks volumes. </p> <p>Almost seven in every 10 British householders own their homes and lavish on them a level of attention and finance which borders on the fanatical. Every weekend, but particularly as spring approaches, we throng garden centres and DIY stores intent on new projects and improvements. There's a strong argument that the obsession with garden decking, pergolas and pebble pools has been forced on homeowners because there is nothing left inside their homes to improve. </p> <p>Easter is the DIY industry's boom time. During the Easter fortnight last year, B&amp;Q sold 2.4m pots of paint, 160,000 metres of roofing felt and 1,440 kilometres of decorative wallpaper borders. </p> <p>'It's both economic and social,' says Lorian Coutts at B&amp;Q. 'It's a lot easier to do things around the home than it was and prices have come down, but there is also a fashion element to it.' </p> <p>Indeed, B&amp;Q may introduce seasonal ranges, so people can update their homes as they do their clothes. </p> <p>Of course, our homes deserve some degree of obsession. They are the most expensive single purchase that most of us will ever make. The latest figures from Mintel's British Lifestyles survey show that expenditure on house purchase amounted to \u00a3128bn last year. According to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the average price in 1999 was \u00a393,500. </p> <p>Consumer confidence in bricks and mortar, dented by the property slump of the late Eighties and early Nineties, has returned. The market is slowing, but mainly because people have been priced out. It grew by 33% between 1990 and 1999. </p> <p>If anything, a slowdown in buying and selling encourages us to spend more time renovating and extending our homes, either to make them more saleable or to increase the livable space. </p> <p>But chartered surveyor Ed Badke who works with London developer Regalian, warns against home improvement hubris: 'I've seen a lot of shoddy DIY work. It may be easier to do it yourself these days but a lot of people delude themselves into thinking they can be a carpenter or a plumber. They can bodge it but that's not the same thing.' </p> <p>The home operates on both an emotional and financial level in the British psyche. DIY is one way we relate to and identify with it. But why are so many of us quite so obsessed? </p> <p>Dr Jeanne Moore, a lecturer in social and environmental psychology at the University of Teesside, who has researched the subject, says: 'The home has immense personal, social and cultural significance and we seem increasingly aware of its value. We even have a nightclub in London called Home. </p> <p>'Fashion designers are now designing for the home. Home has become trendy. Our obsession is not just about having bricks and mortar. Research has shown that home has psychological meaning. This tends to include feelings of safety, security, warmth, comfort, belonging, identity, status and love.' The significance of home is built up from early childhood, she says. </p> <p>'Home is not just a product like a house, but is also a process we are all working through - something we \"do\" as well as \"have\". This \"work\" can be done physically on a new house we own, in the form of DIY, or socially through the family, or emotionally through increased personal privacy. Ultimately, it is about a sense of belonging.' </p> <p>Badke thinks the origins of our obsession may be in the Industrial Revolution, which uprooted rural families and transplanted them to towns, where they had to establish new homes and social networks. </p> <p>It is possible home then became a specific dwelling rather than a locality or family network.

      "bodyText": "Talk to anyone about the British obsession with their homes and sooner or later they will trot out the saying: 'An Englishman's home is his castle.' It is a clich\u00e9 that speaks volumes. Almost seven in every 10 British householders own their homes and lavish on them a level of attention and finance which borders on the fanatical. Every weekend, but particularly as spring approaches, we throng garden centres and DIY stores intent on new projects and improvements. There's a strong argument that the obsession with garden decking, pergolas and pebble pools has been forced on homeowners because there is nothing left inside their homes to improve. Easter is the DIY industry's boom time. During the Easter fortnight last year, B&amp;Q sold 2.4m pots of paint, 160,000 metres of roofing felt and 1,440 kilometres of decorative wallpaper borders. 'It's both economic and social,' says Lorian Coutts at B&amp;Q. 'It's a lot easier to do things around the home than it was and prices have come down, but there is also a fashion element to it.' Indeed, B&amp;Q may introduce seasonal ranges, so people can update their homes as they do their clothes. Of course, our homes deserve some degree of obsession. They are the most expensive single purchase that most of us will ever make. The latest figures from Mintel's British Lifestyles survey show that expenditure on house purchase amounted to \u00a3128bn last year. According to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the average price in 1999 was \u00a393,500. Consumer confidence in bricks and mortar, dented by the property slump of the late Eighties and early Nineties, has returned. The market is slowing, but mainly because people have been priced out. It grew by 33% between 1990 and 1999. If anything, a slowdown in buying and selling encourages us to spend more time renovating and extending our homes, either to make them more saleable or to increase the livable space. But chartered surveyor Ed Badke who works with London developer Regalian, warns against home improvement hubris: 'I've seen a lot of shoddy DIY work. It may be easier to do it yourself these days but a lot of people delude themselves into thinking they can be a carpenter or a plumber. They can bodge it but that's not the same thing.' The home operates on both an emotional and financial level in the British psyche. DIY is one way we relate to and identify with it. But why are so many of us quite so obsessed? Dr Jeanne Moore, a lecturer in social and environmental psychology at the University of Teesside, who has researched the subject, says: 'The home has immense personal, social and cultural significance and we seem increasingly aware of its value. We even have a nightclub in London called Home. 'Fashion designers are now designing for the home. Home has become trendy. Our obsession is not just about having bricks and mortar. Research has shown that home has psychological meaning. This tends to include feelings of safety, security, warmth, comfort, belonging, identity, status and love.' The significance of home is built up from early childhood, she says. 'Home is not just a product like a house, but is also a process we are all working through - something we \"do\" as well as \"have\". This \"work\" can be done physically on a new house we own, in the form of DIY, or socially through the family, or emotionally through increased personal privacy. Ultimately, it is about a sense of belonging.' Badke thinks the origins of our obsession may be in the Industrial Revolution, which uprooted rural families and transplanted them to towns, where they had to establish new homes and social networks. It is possible home then became a specific dwelling rather than a locality or family network. The industrial new rich built homes of grandeur to confirm their new status and mimic the rural gentry. The term 'trading up' applies as much to status and lifestyle aspirations as it does to the property transaction itself. Many people see their homes as status symbols, and want extra status each time they trade up. Alexander Hunt, the partner in charge of the country house department at leading London estate agent Cluttons says: 'People start out buying a flat in London, then migrate to something more substantial in Battersea or Chelsea and then when they start to bring up a family they want to move to a house in the country with all the trappings. It's amazing the passion people have about their homes.' One client has recently sold a home in Kent for \u00a31.25m with outbuildings for his 150 racing pigeons. 'He's bought another property through us, and the clincher was there was enough space to build a new pigeon loft,' says Hunt. While not all of us can aspire to million-pound plus properties in the country many of us fancy executive homes on greenfield estates, or a flat in a converted country manor, as the rural influx of the Industrial Revolution has turned full circle. 'Property is one of the few purchases we make in the anticipation that it's going to be worth more next year than it is this year,' says Badke. 'That's also a big persuader to buy rather than rent. Other forms of investment don't have the same attraction as our own home. 'Certainly my impression is that in Europe people buy later and for specific reasons, such as starting a family.' The British model neatly seals profit and status into one transaction. That's fine until the economic model breaks down, as it did in the late Eighties when plummeting prices and negative equity put people out on the street. They not only lost money, but status. Unlike the other major loss which has traditionally hit men harder than women, redundancy, losing your home crosses the gender divide. Manor from heaven An Englishman's home may be his castle, but for Tom and Sheelagh Lance it is their manor house. When the couple retired two years ago they wanted to move from the bungalow where they had lived for 14 years to a new home which would make a 'personal statement'. They thought about buying abroad, but instead they chose a three-bedroom flat, asking price \u00a3425,000, in Tortington Manor, West Sussex, a development of an 18th-century manor house set in 19 acres and marketed by Cluttons.

It took Thursday's transfer deadline for him to realise how much in demand he still was, to lift his spirits. </p> <p>No fewer than 10 clubs tried to take him on loan until the end of the season, ranging from Sheffield United to Yeovil Town. In the end, the archetypal have-boots-will-travel striker plumped for Millwall, linking up with his old Leicester City team-mate Tony Cottee, also signed on loan, after his own unhappy experience in player-management with Barnet. 'I suppose I'll do all the work again and he'll score all the goals,' Claridge said with a smile. </p> <p>He hasn't done too much of that lately. He insists he is not bitter because of the Pompey experience, more baffled. 'I know that whatever anybody says, I was doing it right,' he says. 'I tried to get everything right in the whole club. The hours I put in. Stupid. I was there till 7.30 every night.' </p> <p>When Claridge replaced the suspended Tony Pulis, he always understood it was to be a permanent appointment.

      "bodyText": "You can't keep a good man down. Steve Claridge was 'mortified' when the Portsmouth owner, Milan Mandaric, told him three weeks ago that he was no longer to be his home-town club's player-manager, after a mere three and a half months in the job. It took Thursday's transfer deadline for him to realise how much in demand he still was, to lift his spirits. No fewer than 10 clubs tried to take him on loan until the end of the season, ranging from Sheffield United to Yeovil Town. In the end, the archetypal have-boots-will-travel striker plumped for Millwall, linking up with his old Leicester City team-mate Tony Cottee, also signed on loan, after his own unhappy experience in player-management with Barnet. 'I suppose I'll do all the work again and he'll score all the goals,' Claridge said with a smile. He hasn't done too much of that lately. He insists he is not bitter because of the Pompey experience, more baffled. 'I know that whatever anybody says, I was doing it right,' he says. 'I tried to get everything right in the whole club. The hours I put in. Stupid. I was there till 7.30 every night.' When Claridge replaced the suspended Tony Pulis, he always understood it was to be a permanent appointment. And his impact was immediate. Portsmouth embarked on a 10-match unbeaten run, climbing to tenth in the First Division - even if they eventually slipped back to precisely the spot they occupied when he was appointed: seventeenth.

      "body": "<p>Pavel Nedved's early goal denied Northern Ireland a precious point on the day they regained their pride off the pitch and their passion on it. </p> <p>The Czech Republic, one of the outstanding teams in world football, were stretched to the limit by the Irish, who were inspired by a magnificent return to the international stage by Keith Gillespie. </p> <p>And they did it in a match which was not soured by the sectarian abuse of Neil Lennon which disfigured their previous international against Norway. </p> <p>By the end the crowd were even chanting Lennon's name, but Gillespie was the player who truly spearheaded Northern Ireland's spirited comeback after Nedved's goal showed why Manchester United, according to rumour, are willing to pay \u00a325 million for him. </p> <p>It was a revival which would have brought a deserved reward if substitute Phil Gray had claimed an 88th-minute equaliser and become the first player to score against the Czechs in the qualifiers. Instead his shot came back off the bar and Roman Tyce cleared his follow-up effort off the line to leave Ireland's prospects of reaching next year's finals looking extremely remote. </p> <p>Manager Sammy McIlroy talked up Ireland's prospects before the game, but his true horizons didn't extend beyond taking a point against the country ranked sixth in the world. </p> <p>There was certainly realism in his tactical approach, with five men sprinkled around the midfield in an attempt to stifle the artistry of talents such as Nedved and Radek Bejbl. </p> <p>Nedved required a mere 11 minutes to show it needs more than a congested midfield to contain him. That was when a clearance by Colin Murdoch rebounded off Jan Koller before a poor clearance by Aaron Hughes left the Lazio star in space on the edge of the area. </p> <p>His early shot carried too much power for keeper Roy Carroll and produced the Czech goal which McIlroy feared so much. The Northern Irish at least managed to contain them for the rest of a first half when the quality gap between the two teams was always apparent. </p> <p>There could have been more goals for the visitors. Koller's quick feet earned him space inside the area for a 20th-minute shot that was capably blocked by Carroll. </p> <p>Nedved sliced another opportunity wide after more unconvincing defending by the Northern Irish and defender Milan Fukal was unable to direct his shot on target after Karel Poborsky's corner was allowed to reach him at the far post. </p> <p>Northern Ireland's response was a 28th-minute opening for David Healy, created by an intelligent pass from Jim Magilton and wasted by the Preston striker's half-hit volley. </p> <p>Otherwise, McIlroy could only be heartened by further evidence that Gillespie has emerged from the trough in his career. The winger, recalled at international level after winning back his place at Blackburn, was quick and incisive down the right flank and offered their only genuine attacking option. </p> <p>Gillespie continued to embarrass left-back Tyce, who was cautioned for a challenge on the winger in the opening stages of the second half. </p> <p>Then Gillespie almost marked his comeback with a rare goal. He eluded Tyce and met Michael Hughes's cross with a diving header which beat Pavel Srnicek but hit the base of the post. </p> <p>Hugely encouraged by Gillespie's performance and an impressive save by Carroll from Nedved after 47 minutes, McIlroy's team enjoyed their best spell of the game, but the significant threats still came from the Czechs. </p> <p>On the hour, Carroll was again alert when he dealt with a 25-yard shot from Tomas Rosicky at the foot of the post. Then Liverpool's Vladimir Smicer showed his ability to miss straightforward chances is not confined to the Premiership when he fired wide after being picked out by Rosicky's low cross in the 67th minute.</p>",

Instead his shot came back off the bar and Roman Tyce cleared his follow-up effort off the line to leave Ireland's prospects of reaching next year's finals looking extremely remote. Manager Sammy McIlroy talked up Ireland's prospects before the game, but his true horizons didn't extend beyond taking a point against the country ranked sixth in the world. There was certainly realism in his tactical approach, with five men sprinkled around the midfield in an attempt to stifle the artistry of talents such as Nedved and Radek Bejbl. Nedved required a mere 11 minutes to show it needs more than a congested midfield to contain him. That was when a clearance by Colin Murdoch rebounded off Jan Koller before a poor clearance by Aaron Hughes left the Lazio star in space on the edge of the area. His early shot carried too much power for keeper Roy Carroll and produced the Czech goal which McIlroy feared so much. The Northern Irish at least managed to contain them for the rest of a first half when the quality gap between the two teams was always apparent. There could have been more goals for the visitors. Koller's quick feet earned him space inside the area for a 20th-minute shot that was capably blocked by Carroll. Nedved sliced another opportunity wide after more unconvincing defending by the Northern Irish and defender Milan Fukal was unable to direct his shot on target after Karel Poborsky's corner was allowed to reach him at the far post. Northern Ireland's response was a 28th-minute opening for David Healy, created by an intelligent pass from Jim Magilton and wasted by the Preston striker's half-hit volley. Otherwise, McIlroy could only be heartened by further evidence that Gillespie has emerged from the trough in his career. The winger, recalled at international level after winning back his place at Blackburn, was quick and incisive down the right flank and offered their only genuine attacking option. Gillespie continued to embarrass left-back Tyce, who was cautioned for a challenge on the winger in the opening stages of the second half. Then Gillespie almost marked his comeback with a rare goal. He eluded Tyce and met Michael Hughes's cross with a diving header which beat Pavel Srnicek but hit the base of the post. Hugely encouraged by Gillespie's performance and an impressive save by Carroll from Nedved after 47 minutes, McIlroy's team enjoyed their best spell of the game, but the significant threats still came from the Czechs. On the hour, Carroll was again alert when he dealt with a 25-yard shot from Tomas Rosicky at the foot of the post. Then Liverpool's Vladimir Smicer showed his ability to miss straightforward chances is not confined to the Premiership when he fired wide after being picked out by Rosicky's low cross in the 67th minute.",

After university, he worked at a language school in Bath while deciding where he wanted to travel. He met many foreign students at the school and planned to visit South America: 'But then I latched on to Japan, started reading about the country and it took off from there.' </p> <p>His enthusiasm was fuelled by meeting Naoko, a Japanese citizen, at the school. They are now married and their first child is due in September. </p> <p>Until recently, the couple have been living on a tight budget. They spent three years in Japan while Andy taught English: 'We returned to England in September 1999 for me to do a one-year MSc course and we lived on yen we had saved, supplemented by occasional bits of work. Out of necessity, we have been careful with our funds.' </p> <p>Their financial position is starting to ease as Naoko recently found a full-time job with a software company. 'With a bit more coming in, we want to set ourselves up as best we can for this next stage of our lives,' Andy says. </p> <p>Andy is in the first year of a PhD studying Japanese investments at the University of Sheffield, 'thankfully with no debts and luckily with a \u00a310,000-a-year scholarship'. </p> <p>He tops up his income with freelance teaching and consultancy. At present he is doing a report on teaching business Japanese in Britain. Despite Japan's current financial problems he believes that 'inward investment businesses are saying it is the best time for Britain to get out there'. </p> <p>The couple will return to Japan soon so that Andy can spend a year or so researching his PhD. He has another scholarship lined up to cover their living expenses there. </p> <p>But this is not holding up their plans to put down roots in the UK and they are moving into their first house in the next few weeks. They nearly gave up looking for a mortgage before Naoko found permanent work. </p> <p>'After being refused by every high street lender on the short-sighted and narrow minded basis that I didn't have a job, we turned as a last resort to Barclays, who gave us a \u00a347,500 mortgage based on my scholarship and an estimate of Naoko's freelance work at that time. I have banked with Barclays since 1991.' </p> <p>They still need to be careful how they spend their money and have already calculated how much they need to furnish their new home. The money for this is coming out of a refund on a Japanese pension of Andy's which was returned when he completed his teaching contract there. </p> <p>After paying the deposit on the house, they will have \u00a32,000 left and intend to start regular saving.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: James Dalby</strong></p> <p>With Naoko's income and Andy's freelance work, they have a good chance to set themselves up and they should aim to stay out of debt. Their new house will deplete their cash reserve, so they need to save any spare money to build this back. </p> <p>I suggest they aim for \u00a35,000 in a deposit account before making stock market-linked investments. The Capital One Bank Direct Saver 2 account offers an interest rate of 6.1 per cent. They could place the money in Andy's name, as his scholarship should not be taxable and he may be able to receive the deposit interest without tax deduction.</p> <p>They must have enough life insurance at least to repay their mortgage if one died. The type of policy depends on the type of mortgage but joint life term insurance could be suitable.</p> <p>For house insurance they should, before comparing quotes, check whether they have opted for their lender's insurance. If not they should contact an insurance broker and a handful of direct telephone-based insurers.</p> <p>If funds allow, they could each start pension planning with a stakeholder pension, perhaps from Norwich Union or Scottish Equitable. After that, they should think about stocks and shares Isas for capital growth and pick a well diversified fund that is invested globally such as Fidelity's Managed International fund, a solid performer. </p> <p>James Dalby works for Bates Investment Services.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Donna Bradshaw</strong></p> <p>Mini cash Isas are an excellent choice, Numerous accounts pay more than Barclays, particularly Smile, with 6.75 per cent. Andy and Naoko should keep a regular eye on rates to get the best return. Up-to-date rates are at www.moneyfacts.co.uk. </p> <p>As Naoko is now a full-time employee, they should shop around for a better mortgage deal than they have at Barclay's. This could save a considerable amount, better put toward protection plans and pensions.</p> <p>On Naoko's salary and a deposit of over 10 per cent of the purchase price they will be able to get a competitive rate of interest.</p> <p>They will need life insurance to cover their mortgage and it is a good idea to add critical illness. Naoko should check what sick pay benefits her employer offers and top up any shortfall with an income protection plan. Cheapest is not always best.</p> <p>Looking even further to the future, I recommend that Naoko joins her employer's pension scheme. If it doesn't offer one, her employer must provide access to a scheme by October.</p> <p>Andy should start saving for retirement and consider a stakeholder pension. They are low cost and do not penalise individuals saving small amounts.</p> <p>He should also consider income protection. As his income is low, the cost will be minimal. </p> <p>Donna Bradshaw is a director of Fiona Price &amp; Partners.</p> <p>\u0095 Advice is for guidance only. Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

I have banked with Barclays since 1991.' They still need to be careful how they spend their money and have already calculated how much they need to furnish their new home. The money for this is coming out of a refund on a Japanese pension of Andy's which was returned when he completed his teaching contract there. After paying the deposit on the house, they will have \u00a32,000 left and intend to start regular saving. Adviser 1: James Dalby With Naoko's income and Andy's freelance work, they have a good chance to set themselves up and they should aim to stay out of debt. Their new house will deplete their cash reserve, so they need to save any spare money to build this back. I suggest they aim for \u00a35,000 in a deposit account before making stock market-linked investments. The Capital One Bank Direct Saver 2 account offers an interest rate of 6.1 per cent. They could place the money in Andy's name, as his scholarship should not be taxable and he may be able to receive the deposit interest without tax deduction. They must have enough life insurance at least to repay their mortgage if one died. The type of policy depends on the type of mortgage but joint life term insurance could be suitable. For house insurance they should, before comparing quotes, check whether they have opted for their lender's insurance. If not they should contact an insurance broker and a handful of direct telephone-based insurers. If funds allow, they could each start pension planning with a stakeholder pension, perhaps from Norwich Union or Scottish Equitable. After that, they should think about stocks and shares Isas for capital growth and pick a well diversified fund that is invested globally such as Fidelity's Managed International fund, a solid performer. James Dalby works for Bates Investment Services. Adviser 2: Donna Bradshaw Mini cash Isas are an excellent choice, Numerous accounts pay more than Barclays, particularly Smile, with 6.75 per cent. Andy and Naoko should keep a regular eye on rates to get the best return. Up-to-date rates are at www.moneyfacts.co.uk. As Naoko is now a full-time employee, they should shop around for a better mortgage deal than they have at Barclay's. This could save a considerable amount, better put toward protection plans and pensions. On Naoko's salary and a deposit of over 10 per cent of the purchase price they will be able to get a competitive rate of interest. They will need life insurance to cover their mortgage and it is a good idea to add critical illness. Naoko should check what sick pay benefits her employer offers and top up any shortfall with an income protection plan. Cheapest is not always best. Looking even further to the future, I recommend that Naoko joins her employer's pension scheme. If it doesn't offer one, her employer must provide access to a scheme by October. Andy should start saving for retirement and consider a stakeholder pension. They are low cost and do not penalise individuals saving small amounts. He should also consider income protection. As his income is low, the cost will be minimal. Donna Bradshaw is a director of Fiona Price &amp; Partners. \u0095 Advice is for guidance only. Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

At least that is what UK charities are finding thanks to generous new incentives from the taxman for charitable donations. </p> <p>Relief on gifts of shares and securities to charity and changes to the Gift Aid scheme have unlocked a flood of money for charitable causes, and much more is expected to flow into their coffers over the next few weeks as higher earners seek to cut their tax liability before the end of the tax year. </p> <p>The Charities Aid Foundation, which last year distributed more than \u00a3100 million to various UK charities, hopes to see gifts of shares to good causes quadruple in size from \u00a38 million in 1999-2000 to\u00a335m this year. </p> <p>Sylvia Baig, trust manager for CAF, said clients for its CharityCard scheme, who would in previous tax years give small sums of money split between different charities, have been making average donations of \u00a35,000 in shares in 2000-01. </p> <p>'We asked them to give us at least \u00a3500 if they were donating shares, but they've given much more,' she said. </p> <p>Donations from individuals who have set up charitable trusts with CAF have also shot up. 'Quite rich people are realising they can get income tax relief as well as capital gains tax relief on a gift of shares. It has really made a difference,' Baig said. </p> <p>Donation of quoted shares and securities to charity has always meant avoidance of capital gains tax (CGT). As of this tax year, however, taxpayers can also gain relief at their marginal rate of income tax - a double boost from the Treasury. </p> <p>Here's how it works: If you are earning \u00a360,000 and were to give quoted shares valued at \u00a310,000, you would pay income tax on only \u00a350,000, reducing your tax liability by \u00a34,000.

      "bodyText": "Spring time and the giving is easy. At least that is what UK charities are finding thanks to generous new incentives from the taxman for charitable donations. Relief on gifts of shares and securities to charity and changes to the Gift Aid scheme have unlocked a flood of money for charitable causes, and much more is expected to flow into their coffers over the next few weeks as higher earners seek to cut their tax liability before the end of the tax year. The Charities Aid Foundation, which last year distributed more than \u00a3100 million to various UK charities, hopes to see gifts of shares to good causes quadruple in size from \u00a38 million in 1999-2000 to\u00a335m this year. Sylvia Baig, trust manager for CAF, said clients for its CharityCard scheme, who would in previous tax years give small sums of money split between different charities, have been making average donations of \u00a35,000 in shares in 2000-01. 'We asked them to give us at least \u00a3500 if they were donating shares, but they've given much more,' she said. Donations from individuals who have set up charitable trusts with CAF have also shot up. 'Quite rich people are realising they can get income tax relief as well as capital gains tax relief on a gift of shares. It has really made a difference,' Baig said. Donation of quoted shares and securities to charity has always meant avoidance of capital gains tax (CGT). As of this tax year, however, taxpayers can also gain relief at their marginal rate of income tax - a double boost from the Treasury. Here's how it works: If you are earning \u00a360,000 and were to give quoted shares valued at \u00a310,000, you would pay income tax on only \u00a350,000, reducing your tax liability by \u00a34,000. If the shares included a capital gain of \u00a35,000, CGT liability of \u00a32,000 is avoided. Your \u00a310,000 gift to charity effectively costs you only \u00a34,000. Hilary Browne-Wilkinson, director of the newly established Institute for Philanthropy, and a former partner at City law firm Allen and Overy, is delighted by the new tax regime. 'It's a wonderful initiative of the Government to go ahead with this and I think it will make a big difference to the amount of giving in the UK,' Browne-Wilkinson said. She says the Treasury is progressively making the tax system more liberal in a bid to encourage the kind of largesse seen in the US, where average giving per household is about five times that seen here. Stephen Burgess, charities consultant to accountant Saffery Champness, says the tax change will unlock vast sums for charity. Wealthy individuals who have exceeded their annual CGT allowance will find donating to charity extremely tax-efficient. 'If you organise it properly the value to charity can be up to five times the after-tax costs to the donor,' he said. One cancer charity seeking rich donors to fund palliative care centres had estimated that instead of targeting people with a net worth of \u00a310m, it could now target people worth \u00a35m as a result of the new tax incentives: 'There aren't that many people worth more than \u00a35m, but there are nine times more than people worth \u00a310m.' The UK shares that qualify for relief include those dealt on a recognised stock exchange in the UK or elsewhere; authorised unit trusts; UK open-ended investment company shares; and some foreign collective investment schemes. At the Charities Aid Foundation, donors can use their shares in three ways. \u0095 To open a CharityCard account, into which the proceeds of the sold shares will be placed, and from which you can distribute money to the causes of your choice; \u0095 To start a charitable trust, where CAF will sell the shares and invest in tax-advantaged funds. You can then make donations to charities of your choice from the dividends and interest; \u0095 To give or sell your shares to CAF, so long as the proceeds less the purchase cost paid to the donor exceeds \u00a3250 and the market value is at least 25 per cent higher than the purchase figure. If you don't have shares to sell, there are other ways to divert money from Gordon Brown's coffers to charity - and give your donation a boost along the way. Gift Aid This scheme, for one-off and regular donations, received an enormous fillip in the past year, when it was extended from a minimum of \u00a3250 to gifts of any amount. If you stipulate that your donation is under Gift Aid, the Inland Revenue treats it as net of basic-rate tax. Charities can claim the equivalent of basic-rate tax on your gift from the Revenue. Higher-rate donors can claim 18 per cent relief (the difference between basic and higher rate) for the gift on their returns. A survey by CAF and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations released last week found that the number of donors using Gift Aid had increased twelvefold under the new rules, giving \u00a31 billion under the scheme by October 2000. CAF research officer Catherine Walker said: 'Around four-fifths of UK taxpayers could give to charity tax-effectively, but don't. These figures are encouraging, but the potential is greater still.' Joanne Smith, head of fund raising at Actionaid, said the charity had never previously benefited as most of its donors give between \u00a315 and \u00a320, but a third of the 120,000 supporters now gave through Gift Aid. Give As You Earn People on PAYE can pay directly from their pay packet before tax is deducted, reducing their tax bills.

      "body": "<p>Police reinforcements were called when a queue outside a restaurant became violent and a man was arrested for punching the restaurant manager. </p> <p>What were they after? McDonald's fast food give-away toys. It happened in Tuen Mun, Malaysia, at one of the 28,000 McDonald's restaurants in 120 countries that feed 45 million customers a day. </p> <p>The arrested man, among thousands who wanted the free McDonald's Snoopy toy given with Big Value meals, complained that the manager had allowed queue jumping. The manager was taken to hospital with chest pains, according to the South China Morning Pos t. </p> <p>Far fetched? Listen to the experience of Lawrence Yap, who has just launched a UK McDonald's collectors club. He visited his birthplace in Malaysia, Ipoh, in the same year, 1998, when he and his family joined a queue for McDonald's toy bears: 'The queue was at least a mile long. Some people queued for several hours and when the toys ran out there were fights and the riot police were called.Sad to say, we did not get a set of bears. McDonald's UK has still not released them over here.' </p> <p>But other McDonald's giveaways are fetching fancy prices. Plastic casts of Disney's 101 Dalmatians, issued here in 1996, now fetch up to \u00a340 each. If your child has a McDonald's dalmatian puppy on an umbrella or one on a tortoise,confiscate it, quick. The full set of 101, boxed with a certificate, was given away as a prize, one per restaurant, and now fetches \u00a3500. The new boxed set of 102 Dalmatians, a tie-in with the film sequel, so far issued only in the US, is worth \u00a3800 here. </p> <p>Dozens of collectors' guides to fast-food toys have been published, covering not only McDonald's but other chains such as Burger King and Wendy's, which capitalised on McDonald's success. </p> <p>Online auctioneer eBay offers thousands of fast-food toys daily. I counted 34 traders in fast food collectables on the web (at The Online Collector) including 'Awesome Fast Food Toys' and 'Gotta Have It - Fast Food Toys'. The gotta-have is intensified by 'cross-over' value; a McDonald's Disney toy may be fought over by both McDonald's and Disney collectors. </p> <p>It's crazy, of course. But in 100 years' time will historians share the view of the snootier among us, that this is a trivial pursuit indulged in by people with no taste in either food or plastic? </p> <p>Consider: McDonald's, the world's biggest food service retailer, with a turnover of $40 billion, has harnessed the pulling-power of icon characters from films, television, computer games, cartoon strips and the toy trade and turned buying hamburgers into a fetish. It is a phenomenon. Mickey Mouse, Batman, Sonic the Hedgehog, Garfield and Barbie have all leased their images to the McDonald's empire. The American Sky Dancers toy, tele vision show and video actually relied on a multi-million dollar McDonald's advertising campaign in order to outsell Barbie. </p> <p>Such fervour for icons is to be found only among the Eastern religions. Or in the tens of thousands of pounds paid for Andy Warhol's silkscreen pop-art images of Marilyn Monroe, Mickey Mouse and the Coca-Cola can. Future sociology and economics students are sure to face examination questions about the nature and significance of the 'McDonald's experience'. What will they make of it? </p> <p>As it happens, there's a lapel pin - one of 25,000 different McDonald's pin designs - showing Mickey Mouse, Marilyn Monroe and a Coke bottle, all joined by McDonald's golden arches. A surfeit of icons to pull the purse strings.The one I saw had attracted a top bid of \u00a36.80 on eBay UK. A snip for both chic intellectuals and fast-food toy punters. </p> <p>If the conjunction of Mickey Mouse and Marilyn Monroe gives you the creeps, it will be because McDonald's has targeted children in order to pull in adults' money. Just as teenagers acquired spending power decades ago, now it is toddlers with pester-power. The twist is that the kids eat the hamburgers and the adults make off with the toys. </p> <p>It started innocently enough. McDonald's founder Ray A. Kroc, a salesman with marketing rights to milkshake mixers, homed in on the children's market as soon as he had bought out the McDonald brothers' burger business for $2.7m in 1961. A marketing visionary, he dreamed up the clown Ronald McDonald, the first 'character' to appear in television commercials in America. But it was not until the launch of McDonald's Happy Meals in 1977, offering a free toy with every helping of hamburger, fries and soft drink, that the stampede started. </p> <p>Today, McDonald's seems to have become squeamish about its children's market. Certainly, its cosseted corporate image gains nothing from adults throwing away food but keeping the Teenie Beanie Baby toys that go with it. Some 100 million Teenie Beanie Babies, a 1997 Happy Meal promotion, were snapped up in little more than a week. An embarrassing success. Last year's Beanies had to be rationed to one per customer (current value in the secondary market - \u00a325 per mint and packed set of 12, \u00a380 for the US version). </p> <p>But McDonald's is stuck with the kids. A $100m marketing campaign to lure adults with Arch Deluxe food, in 1996, was a flop. </p> <p>This may be part of the reason why McDonald's holds toy collectors at arms length, refusing to endorse or sponsor collectors' clubs apart from the big club in Des Plaines, Illinois - home town of the McDonald's Museum and purported site of the first McDonald's restaurant. After all, there's enough mayhem in the retail market for kids' stuff without getting mired in the mad fly-by-night world of adult fast-food toy traders. A UK McDonald's collectors' club that boasted 2,700 members in this country and 4,000 overseas recently folded - its organiser having unexpectedly decamped to sunny Florida. </p> <p>A new club launched in January by Lawrence Yap, a 43-year-old company accountant (\u00a310 annual subscription) so far has 30 members. Once-bitten collectors are obviously still shy. Yap regards McDonald's stand-offishness with amusement. Why, he asked McDonald's UK, as a complete-the-set collector would, did the January Happy Meal giveaway of Digimon digital monsters come with different coloured plastic discs, unannounced by Wham , the 'what's happening at McDonald's' newsletter? And why did pink discs appear in Portsmouth, yellow ones in Wales and Hertfordshire, grey, mauve and blue in Blackpool and Preston and orange in Essex and the Hertfordshire borders? 'They won't tell you anything,' he laughs. 'It's terrible, but it does make collecting more challenging.' </p> <p>Much of the market news that he and Danville Warner, a 38-year-old warehouseman, contribute to the newly revived monthly feature on fast food collectables in Collect It! magazine, is hearsay, gleaned by email from other collectors in the UK and America. Collecting McDonald's is a bit like collecting Swiss Swatch watches, whose multifarious limited editions are distributed capriciously worldwide. </p> <p>American McDonald's addicts seem more supine, attending conventions in big hotels where they dutifully take notes at seminars and turn their rooms into for-sale shrines of McDonald's toys.

      "bodyText": "Police reinforcements were called when a queue outside a restaurant became violent and a man was arrested for punching the restaurant manager. What were they after? McDonald's fast food give-away toys. It happened in Tuen Mun, Malaysia, at one of the 28,000 McDonald's restaurants in 120 countries that feed 45 million customers a day. The arrested man, among thousands who wanted the free McDonald's Snoopy toy given with Big Value meals, complained that the manager had allowed queue jumping. The manager was taken to hospital with chest pains, according to the South China Morning Pos t. Far fetched? Listen to the experience of Lawrence Yap, who has just launched a UK McDonald's collectors club. He visited his birthplace in Malaysia, Ipoh, in the same year, 1998, when he and his family joined a queue for McDonald's toy bears: 'The queue was at least a mile long. Some people queued for several hours and when the toys ran out there were fights and the riot police were called.Sad to say, we did not get a set of bears. McDonald's UK has still not released them over here.' But other McDonald's giveaways are fetching fancy prices. Plastic casts of Disney's 101 Dalmatians, issued here in 1996, now fetch up to \u00a340 each. If your child has a McDonald's dalmatian puppy on an umbrella or one on a tortoise,confiscate it, quick. The full set of 101, boxed with a certificate, was given away as a prize, one per restaurant, and now fetches \u00a3500. The new boxed set of 102 Dalmatians, a tie-in with the film sequel, so far issued only in the US, is worth \u00a3800 here. Dozens of collectors' guides to fast-food toys have been published, covering not only McDonald's but other chains such as Burger King and Wendy's, which capitalised on McDonald's success. Online auctioneer eBay offers thousands of fast-food toys daily. I counted 34 traders in fast food collectables on the web (at The Online Collector) including 'Awesome Fast Food Toys' and 'Gotta Have It - Fast Food Toys'. The gotta-have is intensified by 'cross-over' value; a McDonald's Disney toy may be fought over by both McDonald's and Disney collectors. It's crazy, of course. But in 100 years' time will historians share the view of the snootier among us, that this is a trivial pursuit indulged in by people with no taste in either food or plastic? Consider: McDonald's, the world's biggest food service retailer, with a turnover of $40 billion, has harnessed the pulling-power of icon characters from films, television, computer games, cartoon strips and the toy trade and turned buying hamburgers into a fetish. It is a phenomenon. Mickey Mouse, Batman, Sonic the Hedgehog, Garfield and Barbie have all leased their images to the McDonald's empire. The American Sky Dancers toy, tele vision show and video actually relied on a multi-million dollar McDonald's advertising campaign in order to outsell Barbie. Such fervour for icons is to be found only among the Eastern religions. Or in the tens of thousands of pounds paid for Andy Warhol's silkscreen pop-art images of Marilyn Monroe, Mickey Mouse and the Coca-Cola can. Future sociology and economics students are sure to face examination questions about the nature and significance of the 'McDonald's experience'. What will they make of it? As it happens, there's a lapel pin - one of 25,000 different McDonald's pin designs - showing Mickey Mouse, Marilyn Monroe and a Coke bottle, all joined by McDonald's golden arches. A surfeit of icons to pull the purse strings.The one I saw had attracted a top bid of \u00a36.80 on eBay UK. A snip for both chic intellectuals and fast-food toy punters. If the conjunction of Mickey Mouse and Marilyn Monroe gives you the creeps, it will be because McDonald's has targeted children in order to pull in adults' money. Just as teenagers acquired spending power decades ago, now it is toddlers with pester-power. The twist is that the kids eat the hamburgers and the adults make off with the toys. It started innocently enough. McDonald's founder Ray A. Kroc, a salesman with marketing rights to milkshake mixers, homed in on the children's market as soon as he had bought out the McDonald brothers' burger business for $2.7m in 1961. A marketing visionary, he dreamed up the clown Ronald McDonald, the first 'character' to appear in television commercials in America. But it was not until the launch of McDonald's Happy Meals in 1977, offering a free toy with every helping of hamburger, fries and soft drink, that the stampede started. Today, McDonald's seems to have become squeamish about its children's market. Certainly, its cosseted corporate image gains nothing from adults throwing away food but keeping the Teenie Beanie Baby toys that go with it. Some 100 million Teenie Beanie Babies, a 1997 Happy Meal promotion, were snapped up in little more than a week. An embarrassing success. Last year's Beanies had to be rationed to one per customer (current value in the secondary market - \u00a325 per mint and packed set of 12, \u00a380 for the US version). But McDonald's is stuck with the kids. A $100m marketing campaign to lure adults with Arch Deluxe food, in 1996, was a flop. This may be part of the reason why McDonald's holds toy collectors at arms length, refusing to endorse or sponsor collectors' clubs apart from the big club in Des Plaines, Illinois - home town of the McDonald's Museum and purported site of the first McDonald's restaurant. After all, there's enough mayhem in the retail market for kids' stuff without getting mired in the mad fly-by-night world of adult fast-food toy traders. A UK McDonald's collectors' club that boasted 2,700 members in this country and 4,000 overseas recently folded - its organiser having unexpectedly decamped to sunny Florida. A new club launched in January by Lawrence Yap, a 43-year-old company accountant (\u00a310 annual subscription) so far has 30 members. Once-bitten collectors are obviously still shy. Yap regards McDonald's stand-offishness with amusement. Why, he asked McDonald's UK, as a complete-the-set collector would, did the January Happy Meal giveaway of Digimon digital monsters come with different coloured plastic discs, unannounced by Wham , the 'what's happening at McDonald's' newsletter? And why did pink discs appear in Portsmouth, yellow ones in Wales and Hertfordshire, grey, mauve and blue in Blackpool and Preston and orange in Essex and the Hertfordshire borders? 'They won't tell you anything,' he laughs. 'It's terrible, but it does make collecting more challenging.' Much of the market news that he and Danville Warner, a 38-year-old warehouseman, contribute to the newly revived monthly feature on fast food collectables in Collect It! magazine, is hearsay, gleaned by email from other collectors in the UK and America. Collecting McDonald's is a bit like collecting Swiss Swatch watches, whose multifarious limited editions are distributed capriciously worldwide. American McDonald's addicts seem more supine, attending conventions in big hotels where they dutifully take notes at seminars and turn their rooms into for-sale shrines of McDonald's toys. Judging by pictures of their meetings on the net, a surprising proportion of them are overweight. They obviously go the whole hog. But there's plenty to amuse once you key 'McDonald's' into your computer. For a start, there's the anti-McDonald's activists' mcspotlight.org, a spin-off from the marathon 'McLibel' trial in London. It offers alternative merchandise such as 'McGarbage' T-shirts, \u00a37, and has some very, very rude things to say about Ronald McDonald. As for the corporation, its po-facedness does seem to cause it to shoot itself in the foot, PR-wise. Its bland website headline 'Sue the Dinosaur' looks at first like an invitation to litigation. And why did the corp not feel the need to explain why its newly announced vice president of marketing, Larry Zwain, has a PhD in flavour and fragrance chemistry and a master's degree in food toxicology - food poisoning to you and me. Most curious of all is the weakly punning McDonald's character Hamburglar, a sentimental evocation of a housebreaker in mask and broad-striped overalls. Click on his (presumably stolen) hidden hamburgers on the corporate website and you win a certificate. A fine example to the kids. Still, original McDonald's characters sell for a premium.

      "body": "<p>Staff taking part in Lloyds TSB's flexible working scheme take less time off sick. The bank has yet to quantify the difference between the 2,000 employees taking part in its two-year-old Work Options scheme and the rest of its 78,000 workers, but its spokeswoman and equal opportunities head Sally Evans says: 'It is very clear that they are more motivated and less likely to be absent. Their productivity is better.' </p> <p>This outcome is repeated across companies that have taken this step. In its well-regarded 'Work-Life Balance Manual', the Industrial Society details case study after case study all pointing the same way. For instance, the AA has found that the 'productivity of teleworkers is, on average, 30 per cent higher than office-based staff', and that 'sickness absence is very low and [work] quality very high'. </p> <p>These are the major reasons why Lloyds TSB is a leader in the work-life balance movement. Its chief executive, Peter Ellwood, is chairman of Employers for Work-Life Balance (EWLB), a 22-strong group working closely with the Department for Education and Employment to promote flexible working practices. EWLB was launched a year ago by Tony Blair, and its life was extended this month for a second year. </p> <p>With their huge and heavily female workforces, banks were always likely to be ahead of the field. They estimate that the hidden cost of losing a good senior manager can be \u00a340,000 when you take into account recruitment costs for a replacement, time spent interviewing candidates and the bill for training them. If it was not to lose staff who wanted to start families, Lloyds TSB needed to let them work part-time, share jobs, take career breaks, work only in term time, compress their five-day week into four days or work from home. </p> <p>But the bank also encourages men to join the scheme.

      "bodyText": "Staff taking part in Lloyds TSB's flexible working scheme take less time off sick. The bank has yet to quantify the difference between the 2,000 employees taking part in its two-year-old Work Options scheme and the rest of its 78,000 workers, but its spokeswoman and equal opportunities head Sally Evans says: 'It is very clear that they are more motivated and less likely to be absent. Their productivity is better.' This outcome is repeated across companies that have taken this step. In its well-regarded 'Work-Life Balance Manual', the Industrial Society details case study after case study all pointing the same way. For instance, the AA has found that the 'productivity of teleworkers is, on average, 30 per cent higher than office-based staff', and that 'sickness absence is very low and [work] quality very high'. These are the major reasons why Lloyds TSB is a leader in the work-life balance movement. Its chief executive, Peter Ellwood, is chairman of Employers for Work-Life Balance (EWLB), a 22-strong group working closely with the Department for Education and Employment to promote flexible working practices. EWLB was launched a year ago by Tony Blair, and its life was extended this month for a second year. With their huge and heavily female workforces, banks were always likely to be ahead of the field. They estimate that the hidden cost of losing a good senior manager can be \u00a340,000 when you take into account recruitment costs for a replacement, time spent interviewing candidates and the bill for training them. If it was not to lose staff who wanted to start families, Lloyds TSB needed to let them work part-time, share jobs, take career breaks, work only in term time, compress their five-day week into four days or work from home. But the bank also encourages men to join the scheme. 'More and more people are doing it because they just want a life outside work,' says Evans. 'That means they suffer less stress at work because they are not constantly worried about things outside.' Staff do not have to give a reason for wanting to join the scheme. Many small businesses already operate flexible working: when you just have three employees, it is fairly easy to let them mix and match their hours and duties.

      "body": "<p>Which is the better deal: the mortgage rate of 6.75 per cent offered by Standard Life Bank or the 6.75 per cent recently announced by Abbey National and the Halifax? It depends whether you take out these lenders' mortgage payment protection insurance (MPPI). </p> <p>This cover aims to meet your mortgage payments and other mortgage-related bills for a minimum of 12 months if you are unable to work as a result of an accident, sickness or unemployment - which is why it is also known as ASU cover. For people who could not rely on a partner's income to tide them over, for example, or who do not have a lump sum equal to 12 times their monthly mortgage payment that could be used to avoid falling into arrears, the mortgage industry believes MPPI is a must. </p> <p>It is also good for business. Since it started selling the insurance at cost, the Market Harborough building society's mortgage arrears have fallen to an all-time low. 'We don't look to make a profit on MPPI because it's good for the society as well,' says spokeswoman Alison Dodd. </p> <p>For most other lenders, the idea of passing on in lower premiums the savings gained from having fewer customers in arrears and fewer expensive repossessions is clearly unappealing. </p> <p>In a survey of the top 30 mortgage lenders, Cash has found that even the cheapest premium - \u00a33.71 for every \u00a3100 of cover, charged by Standard Life - is just over twice the \u00a31.75 paid by Market Harborough borrowers. However, in comparison with what other lenders charge, Standard Life - which sells MPPI only to its own borrowers - is giving its customers a good deal. Although borrowers with Abbey National and Halifax pay the same rate on their mortgage, they are spending more than one-and-a-half times as much on MPPI premiums. </p> <p>This is also true of the other lenders which charge around \u00a36 per \u00a3100 (see table). Over a year, the cost of covering a monthly mortgage payment of \u00a3500 with the most expensive MPPI would be nearly \u00a3150 more than the cheapest policy. </p> <p>The Halifax argues that its policy offers good value because the cover is better. Instead of the usual 12-month limit for claims, in common with MPPI from Norwich &amp; Peterborough building society, the Halifax policy will pay out for up to 24 months. For an additional premium, the Britannia and Nationwide building societies offer this kind of extended cover as an optional extra. </p> <p>But is an extended payout period worth paying for? The claims experience of Abbey National suggests not. It says the average claim for accident or sickness lasts less than five months, while the average for those caused by unemployment is just under six months. </p> <p>However, the Halifax does offer one thing that others typically don't: it says it won't refuse to pay claims resulting from the recurrence of an illness from which a policyholder suffered in the 12 months before taking out the policy. But while this benefits some Halifax customers, whether a policy excludes pre-existing medical conditions or not is largely irrelevant to those without a chequered medical history. </p> <p>Healthy Halifax customers - along with those of other lenders - who want both accident and sickness and unemployment cover could save money by switching to an MPPI policy from Marks &amp; Spencer Financial Services (0800 363 448) which costs \u00a34 per \u00a3100. However, switching is not advisable if you have had a period of unemployment. A new policy will not meet future unemployment claims until you have been working continuously for at least a full six months since you were last on the dole. </p> <p>Although the M&amp;S policy is cheaper than those offered by most lenders (except Standard Life), it won't be the best for everyone. This is because, like many lenders, the store chain adopts a one-size-fits-all approach and sells only full ASU at a flat-rate price. </p> <p>Norwich Union Direct (0800 121 008) takes a more tailored approach and adjusts its premiums according to such factors as age, gender, occupation and where you live. This means that low-risk customers do not subsidise those who are at greater risk of claiming. But flexibility generally favours the young and healthy and those in 'safe' jobs. </p> <p>Tailoring cover to your circumstances is also an option with lenders such as Norwich Union, which allows you to pay a lower premium by excluding things you may not need. </p> <p>For example, employees who belong to a decent sick-pay scheme at work should think twice before buying accident and sickness cover. And unemployment cover can be unsuitable for the self-employed, because policies pay out only if you have ceased trading through no fault of your own, have told the Inland Revenue about it and have registered for Job Seekers' Allowance. </p> <p>Covering only against accident and sickness, or just for unemployment, can halve the cost of MPPI. For example, borrowers at Yorkshire building society who buy either accident and sickness or unemployment cover pay \u00a32.17 per \u00a3100 rather than the \u00a34.13 for full all three. </p> <p>For other borrowers who do not need full ASU cover, the \u00a32.25 per \u00a3100 charged by Securityfirst (01376 347369) is likely to be a better deal than the policy offered by their lender. </p> <p>An alternative is to forget MPPI altogether. Faced with falling sales of personal pensions, life insurers are increasingly turning to the income-protection market. </p> <p>For between \u00a310 and \u00a336.50 a month, for example, a non-smoking 40-year-old man could buy income protection from Legal &amp; General which would pay\u00a3500 a month in the event of accident or sickness. </p> <p>Both cost and benefit are comparable with MPPI. But unlike with MPPI, if an illness meant returning to work on lower pay, a benefit in line with the lower earnings would go on being paid. Norwich Union offers similar cover for between \u00a310.25 and \u00a325.25 a month.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Film director Christopher Guest got inspiration for his movie Best In Show after hearing dog owners in a Los Angeles park talking about their pets as if they were children. 'One guy actually referred to them as \"the kids\",' says Guest. </p> <p>No wonder when you consider how much they cost to keep. A quick tally of the day-to-day food and veterinary costs shows that your average cat will cost you more than \u00a37,000 during its lifetime, while a dog can easily chew up \u00a310,000 (see tables). </p> <p>Although US pet owners have a head start in spending extravagant sums on their cats and dogs, UK animal lovers are catching up. Two weeks ago Chelsea hat designer Philip Treacy, who owns a Jack Russell, launched a limited collection of dog leads and collars. Treacy's designs are available in a pret-a-porter version - animal-print pony skin with a gunmetal buckle and clasp - for \u00a354, and couture, with hand-finished gold embroidery (by a leading Paris couture embroidery house, no less) on black velvet priced from \u00a3130. </p> <p>Pet behaviourists are now so common that the BBC has even developed a TV series around their work. Dr Roger Mugford of the Animal Behaviour Centre in Surrey has been dealing with pets' emotional problems for the past 20 years. A trained psychologist, he charges \u00a347 for a telephone consultation, \u00a3141 for an appointment at his clinic and about \u00a3170 for a home visit (referral by a vet is required). </p> <p>And professional walkers leading packs of dogs while their owners are at work are a familiar sight on Hampstead Heath and Battersea Park. So it should come as no surprise that the latest development in the pet world is the 'puppy nanny'. </p> <p>When Sara Hooper-Smith bought her puppy MrDarcey, she intended to take him to work with her every day. But Sara, a public relations specialist, soon found that her work, advising on a company's stock market flotation, was too demanding for her to have a puppy around. </p> <p>'I was working 12 hour days and it just wasn't fair to leave him alone all day,' she says. 'A friend mentioned that she used a puppy nanny, and that it had worked out well for her and her dog, so I decided to give it a try.' </p> <p>For \u00a310 a day, Sara's puppy nanny picks MrDarcey up from the house and takes him to her home, walks and looks after him until Sara picks him up in the evening. Allowing for six weeks holiday a year, Sara has a bill of up to \u00a32,300 a year for someone to look after her dog. </p> <p>While your pet may have no need for a behavioural psychologist or nanny, it could still cost you an arm and a leg during its lifetime. If you want a pedigree pet, the first big hit on your pocket will be the purchase price. The Kennel Club says a pedigree puppy can cost between \u00a3300 and \u00a3500, depending on its size and parentage. According to Joyce Simmons, secretary of the London Cat Club, pedigree cats can cost even more: a pet Burmese or Persian is likely to cost you between \u00a3150 and \u00a3250; a show quality cat can easily cost \u00a3800. </p> <p>If your preferred breed is more exotic or rare, such as a Maine Coone or Maw, you should be prepared to pay more than \u00a31,000. </p> <p>Even if your pet is an ordinary pooch or moggie, you could still spend nearly \u00a310,000 on it during its lifetime. Assuming you can persuade your cat to eat Felix or Whiskas rather than dainty cartons of Hi Life or gently steamed chicken and fish, you are likely to spend at least \u00a31,700 on food. And the food for a dog will cost you more than \u00a34,500 . </p> <p>And while you may think your holidays already cost too much, don't forget that you will also have to pay for someone to look after Fido or Fluffy while you are away. This is likely to cost about \u00a38 to \u00a310 a night for a dog or \u00a35 a night for a cat if you use a kennel, or more for someone to come to your home every day to feed and exercise your pet. For a really deluxe service, Homesitters (01296 630730) arranges for someone to actually stay in your home for the duration of your holiday. The service has an initial setting up cost of \u00a330 plus VAT, and a daily rate of \u00a327 plus VAT for a cat, or \u00a328.90 plus VAT for a medium-sized dog. </p> <p>However, the biggest cost you are likely to encounter is veterinary care. Dogs need regular vaccinations against distemper, parvo virus, infectious hepatitis, kennel cough and leptospirosis, while cats need jabs against cat flu, feline enteritis, feline leukaemia and chlamydia, a condition that affects eyes and respiration. Puppies and kittens start off with two sets of injections at about \u00a330 each, followed by annual boosters. Worming should be carried out more frequently: Your vet may even advise you to worm your puppy or kitten every two weeks up to 12 weeks of age, then monthly until they are six months old, and every three months thereafter. This is likely to cost \u00a32.50 each time for a cat, \u00a33 for a small dog and \u00a39 for a labrador-sized dog. </p> <p>Anti-flea treatment has become year-round with the increase of central heating. Expect to pay about \u00a326 for a packet of six 'spot on' treatments - costing \u00a34.30 a month for a cat, or \u00a35.90 a month for a medium-sized dog. </p> <p>And don't think you can get away with skimping on preventative care. Michael Powell of the Goddard Veterinary Group in London says: 'We see so many cases where a dog or cat is really sick or dies because it hasn't had the necessary boosters or worming treatment. Even fleas can cause really serious skin conditions such as eczema. It's such a shame because it's avoidable.' </p> <p>Unless you want lots of small replicas of your pet, you will also have to pay for neutering. Expect to pay up to \u00a360 for a cat, and up to \u00a3150 for a medium-sized dog. Then there are the one-off costs of non-preventable illnesses and accidents. An operation on a dog or cat with a broken leg can easily cost hundreds of pounds. You can buy pet insurance that covers the cost of a wide range of veterinary treatments, but even then you will have to pay an excess of \u00a340 or \u00a350. </p> <p>Eventually, despite all this care, your pet will die. Owners can have them buried or cremated. Resting Pets in Moreton, Essex, charges between \u00a359 and \u00a3152 for a cremation, depending on the animal's size and whether the ashes are to go in a casket, while a burial with headstone costs between \u00a3350 and \u00a3550.</p> <p><strong>Man's dearest friend?</strong></p> <p>Estimated cost of keeping a dog, based on medium sized mongrel in reasonable health. </p> <p><strong>Dog - 12 years</strong></p> <p><strong>One 80p tin of dog food for 365 days a year</strong> \u00a33,504 </p> <p><strong>\u00a315 of mixer every two months</strong> \u00a31,080 </p> <p><strong>Yearly \u00a330 booster vaccination</strong> \u00a3360 </p> <p><strong>Worming</strong> \u00a3432 </p> <p><strong>De-fleaing</strong> \u00a3850 </p> <p><strong>Pet insurance at \u00a310 a month</strong> \u00a31,440 </p> <p><strong>One \u00a350 insurance excess for visit to vet each year</strong> \u00a3600 </p> <p><strong>Two weeks per year holiday boarding at \u00a38 a night</strong> \u00a31,344 </p> <p><strong>Bedding and sundry equipment </strong>\u00a3100 </p> <p><strong>Total over lifetime</strong> \u00a39,710 </p> <p><strong>A cat on your mat </strong></p> <p>Estimated cost of keeping a cat, based on a moggie in reasonable health.</p> <p><strong>Cat - 13 years</strong></p> <p><strong>Half tin of cat food a day</strong> \u00a31,186 </p> <p><strong>One 80p box of biscuits a week</strong> \u00a3541 </p> <p><strong>Yearly booster vaccination</strong> \u00a3360 </p> <p><strong>Worming</strong> \u00a3130 </p> <p><strong>De-fleaing</strong> \u00a3670 </p> <p><strong>Pet insurance at \u00a36 a month</strong> \u00a3936 </p> <p><strong>Litter \u00a33 a week</strong> \u00a32,028 </p> <p><strong>Two weeks' per year holiday boarding</strong> \u00a3910 </p> <p><strong>One \u00a340 insurance excess for visit to vet a year</strong> \u00a3520 </p> <p><strong>Basket and sundries</strong> \u00a3100 </p> <p><strong>Total over lifetime</strong> \u00a37,381</p>",

      "bodyText": "Film director Christopher Guest got inspiration for his movie Best In Show after hearing dog owners in a Los Angeles park talking about their pets as if they were children. 'One guy actually referred to them as \"the kids\",' says Guest. No wonder when you consider how much they cost to keep. A quick tally of the day-to-day food and veterinary costs shows that your average cat will cost you more than \u00a37,000 during its lifetime, while a dog can easily chew up \u00a310,000 (see tables). Although US pet owners have a head start in spending extravagant sums on their cats and dogs, UK animal lovers are catching up. Two weeks ago Chelsea hat designer Philip Treacy, who owns a Jack Russell, launched a limited collection of dog leads and collars. Treacy's designs are available in a pret-a-porter version - animal-print pony skin with a gunmetal buckle and clasp - for \u00a354, and couture, with hand-finished gold embroidery (by a leading Paris couture embroidery house, no less) on black velvet priced from \u00a3130. Pet behaviourists are now so common that the BBC has even developed a TV series around their work. Dr Roger Mugford of the Animal Behaviour Centre in Surrey has been dealing with pets' emotional problems for the past 20 years. A trained psychologist, he charges \u00a347 for a telephone consultation, \u00a3141 for an appointment at his clinic and about \u00a3170 for a home visit (referral by a vet is required). And professional walkers leading packs of dogs while their owners are at work are a familiar sight on Hampstead Heath and Battersea Park. So it should come as no surprise that the latest development in the pet world is the 'puppy nanny'. When Sara Hooper-Smith bought her puppy MrDarcey, she intended to take him to work with her every day. But Sara, a public relations specialist, soon found that her work, advising on a company's stock market flotation, was too demanding for her to have a puppy around. 'I was working 12 hour days and it just wasn't fair to leave him alone all day,' she says. 'A friend mentioned that she used a puppy nanny, and that it had worked out well for her and her dog, so I decided to give it a try.' For \u00a310 a day, Sara's puppy nanny picks MrDarcey up from the house and takes him to her home, walks and looks after him until Sara picks him up in the evening. Allowing for six weeks holiday a year, Sara has a bill of up to \u00a32,300 a year for someone to look after her dog. While your pet may have no need for a behavioural psychologist or nanny, it could still cost you an arm and a leg during its lifetime. If you want a pedigree pet, the first big hit on your pocket will be the purchase price. The Kennel Club says a pedigree puppy can cost between \u00a3300 and \u00a3500, depending on its size and parentage. According to Joyce Simmons, secretary of the London Cat Club, pedigree cats can cost even more: a pet Burmese or Persian is likely to cost you between \u00a3150 and \u00a3250; a show quality cat can easily cost \u00a3800. If your preferred breed is more exotic or rare, such as a Maine Coone or Maw, you should be prepared to pay more than \u00a31,000. Even if your pet is an ordinary pooch or moggie, you could still spend nearly \u00a310,000 on it during its lifetime. Assuming you can persuade your cat to eat Felix or Whiskas rather than dainty cartons of Hi Life or gently steamed chicken and fish, you are likely to spend at least \u00a31,700 on food.

Mintel particularly mentions Argos and Ikea. The new Mintel British Lifestyles survey shows that the rise in house purchases is mirrored by an increase in expenditure on repairs, maintenance and decoration. The market for household and garden products has risen by 23 per cent in five years at current market prices. </p> <p>'The massive 45 per cent rise in contents insurance is a reflection of the increase in high-priced electrical equipment in people's homes, which they feel the need to insure in case of theft,' according to the survey. </p> <p>We also buy because of new features and designs rather than because we have to replace items (for example, the rise and rise of the chrome kitchen).

      "bodyText": "Around the time people were getting into doing their own decorating and renovating, Habitat came on the scene. The first store was opened by Sir Terence Conran in May 1964 on London's Fulham Road. It set out to make 'style' accessible and affordable. This 'style' is even more available today. Mintel particularly mentions Argos and Ikea. The new Mintel British Lifestyles survey shows that the rise in house purchases is mirrored by an increase in expenditure on repairs, maintenance and decoration. The market for household and garden products has risen by 23 per cent in five years at current market prices. 'The massive 45 per cent rise in contents insurance is a reflection of the increase in high-priced electrical equipment in people's homes, which they feel the need to insure in case of theft,' according to the survey. We also buy because of new features and designs rather than because we have to replace items (for example, the rise and rise of the chrome kitchen). And as we acquire more things so the need to store and display them becomes more pressing, particularly as so many of us live in housing stock not designed for this level of conspicuous consumption. For example, the seven top selling items at Ikea in the UK are storage related. The Ikea phenomenon also illustrates our obsession with the home.
