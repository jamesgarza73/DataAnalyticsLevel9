      "body": "<p>The Republic of Ireland's eventful week came within a whisker of ending with a glorious triumph here in the Amsterdam Arena. </p> <p>The coach, Mick McCarthy, who banned Phil Babb and Mark Kennedy from playing in this match, must have felt his decision was fully vindicated when goals from Robbie Keane and Jason McAteer promised a staggering outcome. But it was not quite to be. Holland fought back, avoiding an embarrassing home defeat with goals by Jeffrey Talan and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, two of the most unlikely marksmen. </p> <p>A torrential downpour in the afternoon had long since given way to a near-balmy evening by the time the game kicked off, with the Republic of Ireland playing towards the goal behind which sat 7,000 of their supporters. </p> <p>Within eight minutes, Robbie Keane was displaying a hint of things to come with a spirited 50-yard dash that began when he left Frank de Boer for dead on the halfway line. Richard Dunne, Mark Kinsella and Roy Keane were all involved in the subsequent exchange of passes before Kevin Kilbane's deep left-wing cross was met by Niall Quinn beyond the far post. His header thudded against the outside of the near-upright to the relief of the majority of the crowd, most of whom were clad in orange replica shirts. </p> <p>Ireland threatened again when Stephen Carr was brought down by Giovanni van Bronckhorst on the edge of the area, but Ian Harte's free-kick carried no great danger for the Dutch. </p> <p>Holland suddenly got their act into order after Frank de Boer had found Michael Reiziger with a pinpoint cross-field pass. The full-back, who faces a Fifa sanction after his pre-match declaration on his website that Holland would try to get Roy Keane sent off, cut inside to fire just wide. As for Roy Keane, he was his usual indefatigable self, cajoling, running, tackling, and doing little to generate animosity among his opponents. </p> <p>Ireland were clearly in the middle of an uncomfortable period, however. There was an anxious moment for Harte when Ronald de Boer tumbled into the area after his challenge. The Slovakian referee waved aside Dutch appeals for a penalty. Ireland's torrid time continued but Richard Dunne managed to get his brow in the way of a goal-bound header from Frank de Boer after a corner from his twin brother. Dunne and Gary Breen were, thankfully, looking sharp in the Irish defence despite having mustered only 80 minutes of Premiership football between them this season. </p> <p>Yet it was another member of the over-worked Irish defence who started the move that led to Robbie Keane's seventh international goal. Carr extricated himself from an unpromising situation near the right corner flag to supply Jason McAteer, who promptly whipped over a cross that was met by Inter's new \u00a312 million signing with a decisive header that gave Edwin van der Sar no chance in the Dutch goal. </p> <p>Renewed confidence surged through the Irish ranks and Harte almost made it two moments later when he sped on to Kilbane's long raking pass only to fail narrowly with a cross-shot. That was more excusable than Quinn's next miss. He could only respond with a weak shot after a slip by Bert Konterman, reminiscent of his wretched contribution the previous weekend for Rangers against Celtic. </p> <p>Holland, now under the control of Louis van Gaal, were still exhibiting the same lack of penetration that proved so costly to his predecessor, Frank Rijkaard, during Euro 2000. Not until the 41st minute, when Dunne blocked a low shot from Paul Bosvelt, did they seriously threaten again. Soon afterwards Patrick Kluivert, having recovered from being dumped on his backside by Dunne near the corner flag, got too much under a cross from Ronald de Boer. Ireland once again cleared the danger but the pressure was back on at the start of the second half. </p> <p>Holland resumed with Clarence Seedorf, on for Barcelona's Reiziger, giving them extra vision and pace in midfield. By the time Van Gaal made another change on the hour, bringing on Arnold Bruggink for his first cap for Richard Witschge, who had made little impression in mid-field, Ireland had gone close again. Quinn flung himself at another cross from Kilbane but was sadly once more off target. Not so McAteer, when the Blackburn player rifled in the second Irish goal from 30 yards with his weaker left foot after a move involving Quinn and Robbie Keane. The Dutch were now seriously up against it, much to the joy of the ecstatic Irish following. </p> <p>Hearts were soon in Irish mouths, however. Talan had been on the field only six minutes as the third Dutch substitute when, with a stooping header, he scored the goal that gave Van Gaal's team a glimmer of hope. The move started when the ball ran kindly for Kluivert out on the left. The Barcelona striker, scorer of the two goals that had ended Ireland's hopes of Euro 96 qualification the last time the nations met, found Ronald de Boer, whose cross picked out Talan at the far post. The midfielder who will shortly be appearing in the Champions League for Heerenveen just beat Harte to the centre. Gary Kelly was beaten again in the 84th minute when Van Bronckhorst swerved a vicious drive into the roof of the net from fully 35 yards. </p> <p><strong> Holland </strong> Van der Sar, Reiziger (Seedorf 46), Konterman (Talan 65), F. de Boer, Van Bronckhorst, Bosvelt, R. de Boer, Witschge (Bruggink 60), Kluivert, Cocu, Bouma.

      "bodyText": "The idea that business and politics don't mix is one of management's most deeply ingrained myths. When people say of a corporation, for instance, or an NHS hospital that 'it's a very political organisation', it's not meant as a compliment. In the same way, 'he or she plays politics', is a damning assessment of a person. But the ideal of a company as a politics-free zone is getting harder and harder to sustain. It was born of an era where rationality and control were the paramount values, and hierarchy and bureaucracy the logical management expression of them. Unfortunately the world is no longer predictable and stable, but chaotic and volatile. The attempt to impose top-down solutions is more a help than a hindrance, so the simplistic vision of management as an exercise in machine-like rationality doesn't wash any more. Dr David Butcher, who leads executive seminars on organisational politics at Cranfield Management School, points out that as long as 50 years ago the theorist Herbert Simon described the behaviour of people in organisations as resembling 'temporary coalitions of interested parties who occasionally do things together'. That view was heretical then, and it is still at odds with much of the conventional theoretical account of the firm. Yet the Simonian notion of organisations as inherently political, says Butcher, strikes chords with managers at every level: junior executives who witness the yawning gap between espoused values such as empowerment and the unspoken command-and-control reality; middle managers who are only too conscious of finding their best ideas squashed because of political considerations; and senior executives who, the moment they reach the top, cannot avoid realising that every decision they make, whether on management appointments, the siting of a new plant or investing in a new internet venture, is political before all else. In fact, says Butcher, once it's accepted that business management is no longer a matter of identifying the one right solution, the parallels between 'politics' with a big 'P' and the organisational variety are greater than commonly supposed - or than the normal language of management allows. Both are fundamentally about resolving the clash of competing causes. In reaching this resolution, drafting white papers, canvassing interested parties, lobbying, leaks and deals in smoke-filled rooms are all part of the political game.

Finland leads the way but, with a quarter of a million new teleworkers since last spring, Britain is catching up fast. These statistics form part of a European-wide survey into teleworking to be published in London later this month at Telework 2000. </p> <p>This is the first time the European teleworking conference has been held in the UK. Peter Johnston, head of the European Commission's information society directorate, who ordered the research, will be among the speakers. He says the EC sees the promotion of teleworking as central to achieving its aim of raising the proportion of Europeans of working age in employment from 61 per cent today to 70 per cent by 2010. 'We have to hit this target if we are to fund social security and pensions in the future and teleworking removes a lot of the barriers to working - particularly for women, older people and disabled people,' he says. </p> <p>The EU is funding research into electronic methods of working to the tune of 50 million euros (\u00a331 million). 'The European Social and Regional Development funds which exist to accelerate development in less-favoured regions of the EU have also been very effective in getting teleworking schemes onstream,' says Johnston. 'Teleworking is not just about greater efficiency and productivity, it is increasingly the most effective way to improve the work-life balance, the way to stimulate creativity and the way to achieve more efficient use of office space and transport infrastructures.' </p> <p>Alan Denbigh, executive director of the TCA (the Telework and Telecentre Association) says: 'The conventional 9-5 workplace is actually unsuitable for work. The buildings are often unhealthy and there are constant interruptions.' He also believes that the traditional office environment with its fixed hours, clothing and hierarchies, all reminiscent of schooldays, is 'infantilising'. He says 'teleworkers are re-empowered and this increases productivity'. </p> <p>'Any major organisation that has still not considered flexible working is going to miss out,' says Ursula Laws of the Institute of Employment Studies. Her organisation's figures show how far teleworking has spread. She says: 'There has been an increase of 22 per cent in employees teleworking and 15 per cent in self-employed, a 12 per cent increase in clerical working despite a general decrease in the clerical workforce and a growth in financial services, the strongest of all sectors, by 34 per cent.' </p> <p>One type of business that could be revolutionised by teleworking is the call-centre, where demand for staff frequently exceeds supply. Only 4 per cent of call centre managers employ teleworkers, but 42 per cent expect to do so in the near future. Next time you break down your emergency call could well be taken by one of the 150 people working in the AA's virtual call centre. Denbigh says: 'It takes 18 months to build a call centre and a couple of weeks to set up a virtual one. Which would you choose? Teleworking reduces the overheads - there may be marginally increased technology costs but these are more than offset by savings in office space - and it increases flexibility as nobody wants to come into the office for just a couple of hours' work, but at home it's different.' </p> <p>He says manufacturers of the technology such as BT and IBM are proving through their own working practices that the technology is up to the job. One former BT employer says: 'For years BT was advocating teleworking but not doing it itself. It has realised this and now lots of BT staff work from home.' </p> <p>The teleworker's teleworker must be Volker Krieger. He lives in Germany and works for a Swiss technology corporate with customers all over Europe and Poland. 'I have at least three offices,' he says. 'Half of the time, it's my lap top which I frequently use in the car hooked up to a mobile phone, 20 per cent of the time I'm at home and 30 per cent of the time I work in one or other of our offices. About half of my work is virtual and half is physical - that is, face-to-face with the client, but that's expensive and time-consuming. I think I can reduce this to less than 20 per cent.' </p> <p>Krieger believes teleworking will become the natural way of operating. 'It's a generational thing. Today's schoolchildren will be natural teleworkers. To them using the tools of teleworking is normal not new.' </p> <p>Currently, transnational teleworking is limited but the European company statute will, when agreed by the EU countries, enable direct employer-employee relationships to be established across the national boundaries.

Those who do charge even when you clear the account include: Alliance &amp; Leicester Diamond, Bank of Scotland 'One', Halifax Visa Balance, Lloyds TSB Asset Advance, Co-op Gold Advantage. </p> <p>Otherwise, for the months that you do not pay your bill in full by the due date, you are charged interest on the whole balance and not just the amount left unpaid. In these circumstances, most cards start charging interest from the date you make the purchase. Until now, John Lewis has been generous and charged no interest until the first of the month after the payment due date. But from October, with sister store Waitrose, it will backdate interest to the date of purchase. </p> <p>When you paid no interest until the due date, it made no difference whether you paid early or late in the month. But with interest clocking up from the day you shop, you can save interest by paying the bill when it arrives. Interest builds up daily, so the sooner you pay, the less interest you incur. If you pay the bill in full, you avoid interest anyway, so might as well pay at the last moment. </p> <p>At the end of the month, card companies calculate your average daily balance. Assuming, in a 31-day month, you spent \u00a32,000 on the 10th and \u00a350 on the 20th: you have borrowed \u00a32,000 for 22 days and \u00a350 for 12 days. The daily average balance is \u00a31,438.71. Multiply this by the monthly interest rate for the interest until the date of the statement. But this is only the start of the calculation. You then pay interest from the statement date until the time you pay the bill, again based on the daily average, but taking account of credits and money paid in. It means you are paying interest on the interest. </p> <p>You can reduce interest charges by making large purchases late in the month. Your balance at the end of the month will be high but the daily average will be lower.</p>",

Those who do charge even when you clear the account include: Alliance &amp; Leicester Diamond, Bank of Scotland 'One', Halifax Visa Balance, Lloyds TSB Asset Advance, Co-op Gold Advantage. Otherwise, for the months that you do not pay your bill in full by the due date, you are charged interest on the whole balance and not just the amount left unpaid. In these circumstances, most cards start charging interest from the date you make the purchase. Until now, John Lewis has been generous and charged no interest until the first of the month after the payment due date. But from October, with sister store Waitrose, it will backdate interest to the date of purchase. When you paid no interest until the due date, it made no difference whether you paid early or late in the month. But with interest clocking up from the day you shop, you can save interest by paying the bill when it arrives. Interest builds up daily, so the sooner you pay, the less interest you incur. If you pay the bill in full, you avoid interest anyway, so might as well pay at the last moment. At the end of the month, card companies calculate your average daily balance. Assuming, in a 31-day month, you spent \u00a32,000 on the 10th and \u00a350 on the 20th: you have borrowed \u00a32,000 for 22 days and \u00a350 for 12 days. The daily average balance is \u00a31,438.71. Multiply this by the monthly interest rate for the interest until the date of the statement. But this is only the start of the calculation. You then pay interest from the statement date until the time you pay the bill, again based on the daily average, but taking account of credits and money paid in. It means you are paying interest on the interest. You can reduce interest charges by making large purchases late in the month. Your balance at the end of the month will be high but the daily average will be lower.",

After all the calamities of the past few years, what could be more appropriate that than the company's slogan: \"Where there's a blame, there's a claim.\"",

In simple terms, he is not good enough - no disgrace in that provided you have given your all - but he cannot admit it. </p> <p>The watershed came at Old Trafford when, having got back into the side at the start of the series, he was presented with a turning pitch, a collection of left-handers and told to go out and win the game. But 47 huffing, puffing, oohing, aahing, grimacing overs later he had taken just a single wicket for 124 and blown it. If a seamer had produced those figures on a greentop he would have been derided. </p> <p>So what is his problem now? Is it the notion that his record abroad is massively superior to that at home (26 wickets at 23.27 - more than respectable - compared with 13 at 73.23)? Well, his inability to take wickets under pressure to do so counts against him just as it should with seamers, and of batsmen to make runs. </p> <p>Is he just kidding himself when he suggests that the England management set-up under Hussain and Duncan Fletcher has not taken things forward? Just ask those involved. The only thing that has not made strides, it seems to me, is Croft's bowling. </p> <p>Is he then seriously suggesting that selection is such a democratic process that every player gets precisely the same opportunity irrespective of ability?

However, his record abroad, where he has played three-quarters of his 41 Tests, is mediocre. </p> <p>His response, in his newspaper column, has been to express his disappointment but also, wryly, his determination to improve and become the multi-dimensional cricketer that he believes England are seeking now. He was taking the piss, of course, but it touched a chord. </p> <p>It is desperately hard to go on tour after tour and end up as drinks carrier and Croft has had three winters much like that.

      "body": "<p> \"A new era of great British production... great British production in all genres... great British programmes.\" Britishness runs like a litany through Greg Dyke's MacTaggart Lecture, reiterating the hope that the BBC's distinct national identity may continue to single it out from the dozens of other channel offerings in the digital revolution. </p> <p>Presumably Dyke means multi-ethnic Britishness, not Englishness, although the BBC's royal charter horoscope (January 1 1927) links strongly to the quintessential English national horoscope, the coronation of William the Conqueror on Christmas Day 1066. Both horoscopes have an identical Capricorn sun, making the BBC the cultural crown of the nation. Capricorn's are traditional, reserved, dutiful... the stuffy Beeb and the stiff upper lip.</p> <p>Dyke aims to make this old Capricorn Auntie \"more exciting, more gripping\", but she faces the unanswerable dilemma of justifying a licence fee in an age of commercial channels. He wants universality - free, public service broadcasting - with channel genres and a creative environment for talented people. Will his strategies work?</p> <p>Dyke's realistic, business-oriented Taurean nature (May 20 1947) peppers his lecture with talk of cash for this and cash for that. With the Gemini twins also strong, he should move deftly between public service broadcasting and commercial profit, from analogue past to digital future. </p> <p>The immediate prospects look good. The BBC has tremendous leverage with its vast programme content through pay-on-demand and IT related services. Radical changes can be expected in June 2002 when the Sun joins hi-tech Uranus, favouring creative outsider talent.</p> <p>But there's something missing. Media today has the Jupiterian role once performed by the church or the law, providing ethical and spiritual authority, but this isn't the language of modern times. Dyke's Taurean approach suggests management, not vision. To hold its archetypal place in the nation's psyche, the BBC must take this on board, with Dyke or without him. </p> <p>Email the Media Medium at: <a href=\"mailto:maggie@companyguide.co.uk\">maggie@companyguide.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "\"A new era of great British production... great British production in all genres... great British programmes.\" Britishness runs like a litany through Greg Dyke's MacTaggart Lecture, reiterating the hope that the BBC's distinct national identity may continue to single it out from the dozens of other channel offerings in the digital revolution. Presumably Dyke means multi-ethnic Britishness, not Englishness, although the BBC's royal charter horoscope (January 1 1927) links strongly to the quintessential English national horoscope, the coronation of William the Conqueror on Christmas Day 1066. Both horoscopes have an identical Capricorn sun, making the BBC the cultural crown of the nation. Capricorn's are traditional, reserved, dutiful... the stuffy Beeb and the stiff upper lip. Dyke aims to make this old Capricorn Auntie \"more exciting, more gripping\", but she faces the unanswerable dilemma of justifying a licence fee in an age of commercial channels. He wants universality - free, public service broadcasting - with channel genres and a creative environment for talented people. Will his strategies work? Dyke's realistic, business-oriented Taurean nature (May 20 1947) peppers his lecture with talk of cash for this and cash for that. With the Gemini twins also strong, he should move deftly between public service broadcasting and commercial profit, from analogue past to digital future. The immediate prospects look good. The BBC has tremendous leverage with its vast programme content through pay-on-demand and IT related services. Radical changes can be expected in June 2002 when the Sun joins hi-tech Uranus, favouring creative outsider talent. But there's something missing. Media today has the Jupiterian role once performed by the church or the law, providing ethical and spiritual authority, but this isn't the language of modern times. Dyke's Taurean approach suggests management, not vision. To hold its archetypal place in the nation's psyche, the BBC must take this on board, with Dyke or without him.

All I knew about her was that she is 35, a teacher, likes hiking, is interested in Eastern philosophy, and speaks perfect English. More importantly, she loves meeting people from all around the world, learning about their country and teaching them about hers. </p> <p>I'd been introduced to Cristina through Women Welcome Women World Wide (5W), an organisation that \"aims to foster international friendship\" by introducing women from different countries. Its members include women of all ages and types - students, housewives, professionals, married, single, retired. With 5W, you can experience other cultures, get insider knowledge of the places you visit, and make new friends. If you are nervous about travelling alone, it provides a safe and welcoming structure, and, of course, you don't have hotel bills to foot. </p> <p>There is, however, the small matter of getting on with a stranger for several days. And as anyone who has used dating agencies will know, the fact that your list of hobbies matches does not necessarily mean you'll hit it off. Conversation can be a little forced, and on the drive back to Cristina's home town of Vicenza, we covered the weather (unseasonable), Italian politics (dodgy), Italian men (\"traditional\"), and England in general (wonderful). </p> <p>Vicenza, an hour from Venice, is not a place I had ever thought of visiting, but that is one of the unexpected benefits of 5W. I found it has graceful squares with Palladian columns and arches. We strolled around town while Cristina explained any local oddities, like the half-built palace which ran out of funds, and the local university tradition of lewd comic caricatures plastered around town by celebrating graduates. </p> <p>I was treated more like a long-lost best friend than a total stranger. Despite my protests, Cristina insisted on giving me her room while she slept on the sofa. She laid out breakfast for me before she went to work, sorted out my travel arrangements, and took a day off to show me around Venice. Other than taking her out for dinner to show my gratitude, there was not a lot I could do to repay so much hospitality; for the organisation to work, you must simply do your best to extend your own hospitality to other travellers. </p> <p>I spent my first day in Venice on my own. St Mark's Square, the tourist hub of the City, heaved with tourists, crowding over the bridges, queueing for entrance to the Basilica, hands outstretched to feed the pigeons and staring up at the architecture. There's no denying it's an incredible place, particularly the shimmering mosaics of the Basilica, but in the summer it's enough to make a sane person flee for their life. </p> <p>The next day, Cristina showed me parts of Venice I hadn't been aware of - the cramped twists and turns of the Jewish ghetto, the quiet and relatively spacious Cannaregio canal which is so much less visited than the Grand Canal, and the shops of San Leonardo. After lunch, we got lost together in the San Polo and Santa Croce area, where there are so many quiet little streets that even Cristina found herself in places she had never seen before. </p> <p>But these added hours in each other's company began to highlight our differences. I began to appreciate why 5W suggests that you spend no more than a couple of nights on the first visit; although we both made the effort, it became clear that ultimately we were still two strangers with not a lot in common, whose attitudes to life were not always compatible. </p> <p>Let's face it, meeting strangers can be a bit of a trial, so you have to go in with the right attitude. If you find it difficult to adapt to a different lifestyle, or annoying to hold conversations in broken English, then you would need to choose your hostesses carefully. And if you find that being a guest, weighed down with a debt of gratitude and tangled up in a web of good manners, is more of a constraint than a liberation - don't bother. The system doesn't work when it is used just for free accommodation; you have to want it to work socially. </p> <p>Cristina has had 5W visitors from England and Hong Kong, and has stayed with members in England, Wales, the Shetlands and Amsterdam as well as meeting members in Vancouver and California for lunch. 5W has the world more or less covered, with 3,000 mem bers in 70 countries from Norway to Tasmania. If you are at a loose end one evening in Argentina, or looking for someone to show you around Lithuania one afternoon, 5W can supply the contact - the rest is up to you. You could even tour Australia staying with different members around the country, or - why stop there? - the whole world. </p> <p>Cristina likes to travel on her own, but not to be alone. And, like many women travellers, she doesn't find it either safe or easy to meet strangers while abroad.

The former, note the Good Hotel Guide authors, accepts paid advertisements from some hotels \"which might also confuse readers\". (The RAC does, too.)

Nor do at least two others: the Consumers' Association's Which? Hotel Guide and the Michelin Red Guide to Great Britain and Ireland. </p> <p>Peter Hancock, publishing director of Johansens, rejects the Raphaels' objection, although accepting that the price for entries, based on the number of bedrooms, can cost up to \u00a33,000. \"We are not alone in charging. We maintain our independence and total integrity by excluding those hotels which don't live up to our standards.\". </p> <p>The AA says hotels pay an annual fee to join the rating system. They only get into the guide if they then pass an inspection and only then may they advertise. The RAC works in the same way. It says: \"Each year, upon payment of a fee, an assessment is carried out by a fully trained, independent RAC inspector. Hotels are only offered the opportunity to advertise after they have joined the scheme and been awarded a rating.\" </p> <p>The English Tourism Council also charges a fee for assessment. Hoteliers pay extra if they want a more lavish entry, with colour photos, for example. \"Obviously a hotel has to make the grade to be included. We do take into account quality of service and food, for example, when we grade a property. We don't set out to offer any observations in the guides on things like the colour of the wallpaper or the cooking - but we would mention if the hotel kitchen had an award, such as a Michelin star\".</p> <p><strong>Looking for a place to stay? </strong></p> <p>The Good Hotel Guide Great Britain &amp; Ireland 2001: \u00a314.99. </p> <p>Michelin Red Guide to Great Britain and Ireland: \u00a313.50.</p> <p>AA/RAC guides: \u00a314.99/ \u00a312.99.</p> <p>Which?

The national tourist boards of England, Scotland and Wales, produce their own listings, with accommodation owners paying a registration or membership fees. This means \"you won't get a warts and all description\". The AA and RAC, charge fees for inspection. The former, note the Good Hotel Guide authors, accepts paid advertisements from some hotels \"which might also confuse readers\". (The RAC does, too.) Confusingly, the two motoring organisations have harmonised their grading schemes with that of the English Tourism Council but not with those of the Scottish and Welsh boards, which place greater emphasis on quality, rather than on facilities. The Good Hotel Guide takes no advertising, hospitality or payment \"of any kind\". Nor do at least two others: the Consumers' Association's Which? Hotel Guide and the Michelin Red Guide to Great Britain and Ireland. Peter Hancock, publishing director of Johansens, rejects the Raphaels' objection, although accepting that the price for entries, based on the number of bedrooms, can cost up to \u00a33,000. \"We are not alone in charging. We maintain our independence and total integrity by excluding those hotels which don't live up to our standards.\". The AA says hotels pay an annual fee to join the rating system. They only get into the guide if they then pass an inspection and only then may they advertise. The RAC works in the same way. It says: \"Each year, upon payment of a fee, an assessment is carried out by a fully trained, independent RAC inspector. Hotels are only offered the opportunity to advertise after they have joined the scheme and been awarded a rating.\" The English Tourism Council also charges a fee for assessment. Hoteliers pay extra if they want a more lavish entry, with colour photos, for example. \"Obviously a hotel has to make the grade to be included. We do take into account quality of service and food, for example, when we grade a property. We don't set out to offer any observations in the guides on things like the colour of the wallpaper or the cooking - but we would mention if the hotel kitchen had an award, such as a Michelin star\".

      "body": "<p>A price war has broken out down under with the introduction of Richard Branson's new Australian domestic airline, Virgin Blue, which began flying on the popular 65-minute route between Sydney-Brisbane on Thursday for A$99 (\u00a340). </p> <p>Qantas, Ansett and another new private airline, Impulse, have been forced to follow suit, slashing their fares and bringing obvious commercial benefits to Sydney and Brisbane but more significantly to the cities' beautiful and less explored rural hinterlands. </p> <p>More and more overseas tourists are visiting rural Australia; a recent report showed they spend nearly \u00a31bn each year outside the cities. Towns such as Toowoomba in Queensland's fertile Darling Downs, and Broken Hill in outback New South Wales are key staging posts for overlanders and tour groups searching for the Real Australia - a land of wide-open spaces, pioneers, and rural hospitality. </p> <p>There's a world of difference between the \"country\" and the \"outback\", as far as Australians are concerned. The former is the good farmland and rolling, verdant hills that stretch away from the coasts but stop short of the desert fringe. Outback is everything else - Australia's burning heart where eucalyp tus groves turn into wide expanses of salt bush, creeks lose their water and bronzed mountain ranges lie like the carcasses of long-dead dinosaurs across the desert floor. </p> <p> By the time the Great Dividing Range reaches Queensland, its mountains have become hills and its crags softened into grassy knolls. </p> <p>The Darling Downs is one of the most poetic landscapes in Australia, and was as far into the interior as most settlers risked going in the 1800s. Beyond here lie hostile outback plains of red dust. </p> <p>Well-to-do Englishmen claimed vast tracts of this land, building homesteads and living like lords , dressing for dinner and riding to hounds . One of them, a timber merchant, settled on Listening Ridge, 15 minutes from Toowoomba, the commercial centre of the Downs, and built a house with views to a distant horizon. </p> <p>Today, his descendants, Sue and Shirley Pechey, run it as a B&amp;B. Guests stay in two cosy cabins, eat home-cooked meals and have several hundred square miles of stunning hill country to explore. Nearby is Crow's Nest National Park, one of the last spreads of original eucalyptus forest left in the Downs, and home to an assortment of Australia's comic wildlife, such as sugar gliders, blue-faced honeyeaters and platypus. </p> <p> <strong> Getting there: </strong> Two to three hours' drive from Brisbane by road.

Miners poured in from all over Australia and abroad. The town built 77 hotels to hold them. Now, it is foreign visitors who flock to here for a taste of pioneer heritage. </p> <p>Broken Hill is the centre of the Accessible Outback, where visitors can experience life in the desert without giving up the comforts of home. There are mine tours; a host of art galleries and a peaceful sculpture garden in which to enjoy the sunset; Mutawintji National Park with ancient Aboriginal rock-carvings; and tranquil lakes at Menindee, with its flocks of exotic birds. </p> <p>A day's drive north is the opal mining town of White Cliffs. A kangaroo shooter first stumbled over a dazzling opal here more than 100 years ago and men have come ever since to dig and live in holes in the ground. </p> <p>One set of old workings has become the Dug Out Underground Motel, sculpted by Leon and Marge Hornby. </p> <p> <strong> Getting there: </strong> From Sydney, <a href=\"http://www.gsr.com.au\">Indian Pacific and the Ghan trains</a> take approximately 18 hours and cost \u00a3100 return.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.greyhound.com.au\">Greyhound coaches</a> also take about 18 hours and cost \u00a325 one-way.</p> <p>Flights with <a href=\"http://www.hazelton.com.au\">Hazelton Ansett</a>, 00 61 2 6393 11000, cost \u00a3194 for 21-day advance return from Sydney. 4WD needed for White Cliffs and Mutawintji. </p> <p> <strong> What to do: </strong> Mine tours Broken Hill Tourism (00 61 8 8087 6077, email <a href=\"mailto:tourist@pcpro.net.au\">tourist@pcpro.net.au</a>); Thankakali cultural centre to meet Aboriginal artists (00 61 8 8087 6111); Mutawintji National Park for rock paintings (00 61 8 8088 5933); opal mines in White Cliffs (Broken Hill Tourism for list); Sculpture Symposium for sunset (Broken Hill Tourism for gate key); Lakes nature tour (Geoff Looney 00 61 8 8091 4437). </p> <p> <strong> General information: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.tourism.nsw.gov.au\">Tourism New South Wales</a> (UK), tel: 020-7887 5003. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay: </strong> Miner's Cottages (Broken Hill Tourism for list).

Convicts from Britain and Ireland deemed too dangerous to keep in the burgeoning colony of Sydney Cove were shipped north to an unknown place with an infernal climate. Being a few miles inland on the Brisbane River, it missed the coastal breezes. </p> <p>Prisoners suffered inhuman accommodation and back-breaking labour in the steamy tropical heat. Neither they nor their gaolers could have dreamed that nearly 200 years later, thousands of people would crave this spot, its mangrove swamps and year-round sunshine. </p> <p>For Brisbane is booming. Property prices are rocketing, businesses are flocking here to set up offices and hold conferences, and service industries can barely keep pace with the influx of holidaymakers. </p> <p>The South Bank cultural complex on the Brisbane River has the fun and style of its London ancestor. Its exhibitions of international and contemporary Australian art and design are making the Sydney galleries keep a close eye on their northern rival. </p> <p>The Botanical Gardens inhabit a loop of the river and make for a good early morning stroll. The French Renaissance architecture of Parliament House is a throwback to colonial times, as are many of the buildings in the city. A heritage trail takes in several of them and is a good starting point for visitors fresh off the plane. </p> <p> The proximity of the city to the Great Barrier Reef, an hour's flight north, has added to its popularity. And the giant casino at the glitzy, gaudy holiday playground of the Gold Coast, two hours south by road, which has given the region the unwelcome nickname of BrisVegas, has boosted the number of visitors. </p> <p>Possibly its greatest asset, however, is the lack of attitude. While Sydney glows with celebrity status and chutzpah, and Melbourne with aloof European style and chic, Brisbane is relaxed and unassuming. Palm trees shading riverside caf\u00e9s rustle in the warm breezes.

      "bodyText": "A price war has broken out down under with the introduction of Richard Branson's new Australian domestic airline, Virgin Blue, which began flying on the popular 65-minute route between Sydney-Brisbane on Thursday for A$99 (\u00a340). Qantas, Ansett and another new private airline, Impulse, have been forced to follow suit, slashing their fares and bringing obvious commercial benefits to Sydney and Brisbane but more significantly to the cities' beautiful and less explored rural hinterlands. More and more overseas tourists are visiting rural Australia; a recent report showed they spend nearly \u00a31bn each year outside the cities. Towns such as Toowoomba in Queensland's fertile Darling Downs, and Broken Hill in outback New South Wales are key staging posts for overlanders and tour groups searching for the Real Australia - a land of wide-open spaces, pioneers, and rural hospitality. There's a world of difference between the \"country\" and the \"outback\", as far as Australians are concerned. The former is the good farmland and rolling, verdant hills that stretch away from the coasts but stop short of the desert fringe. Outback is everything else - Australia's burning heart where eucalyp tus groves turn into wide expanses of salt bush, creeks lose their water and bronzed mountain ranges lie like the carcasses of long-dead dinosaurs across the desert floor. By the time the Great Dividing Range reaches Queensland, its mountains have become hills and its crags softened into grassy knolls. The Darling Downs is one of the most poetic landscapes in Australia, and was as far into the interior as most settlers risked going in the 1800s. Beyond here lie hostile outback plains of red dust. Well-to-do Englishmen claimed vast tracts of this land, building homesteads and living like lords , dressing for dinner and riding to hounds . One of them, a timber merchant, settled on Listening Ridge, 15 minutes from Toowoomba, the commercial centre of the Downs, and built a house with views to a distant horizon. Today, his descendants, Sue and Shirley Pechey, run it as a B&amp;B. Guests stay in two cosy cabins, eat home-cooked meals and have several hundred square miles of stunning hill country to explore. Nearby is Crow's Nest National Park, one of the last spreads of original eucalyptus forest left in the Downs, and home to an assortment of Australia's comic wildlife, such as sugar gliders, blue-faced honeyeaters and platypus. Getting there: Two to three hours' drive from Brisbane by road. McCafferty's Coaches tel: +131499) charge \u00a36 one way. Holiday Autos (0870 400 0011 in UK) charge from \u00a3175 a week car hire. What to do: Toowoomba Carnival of Flowers in September ,Garden Fest in April; historic buildings tour; Jondaryan Woolshed for shearing demonstrations and historical tours.

When silver, lead and zinc was uncovered in Broken Hill in the late 19th century, the beer flowed like a flash flood across the desert. Miners poured in from all over Australia and abroad. The town built 77 hotels to hold them. Now, it is foreign visitors who flock to here for a taste of pioneer heritage. Broken Hill is the centre of the Accessible Outback, where visitors can experience life in the desert without giving up the comforts of home. There are mine tours; a host of art galleries and a peaceful sculpture garden in which to enjoy the sunset; Mutawintji National Park with ancient Aboriginal rock-carvings; and tranquil lakes at Menindee, with its flocks of exotic birds. A day's drive north is the opal mining town of White Cliffs. A kangaroo shooter first stumbled over a dazzling opal here more than 100 years ago and men have come ever since to dig and live in holes in the ground. One set of old workings has become the Dug Out Underground Motel, sculpted by Leon and Marge Hornby. Getting there: From Sydney, Indian Pacific and the Ghan trains take approximately 18 hours and cost \u00a3100 return. Greyhound coaches also take about 18 hours and cost \u00a325 one-way. Flights with Hazelton Ansett, 00 61 2 6393 11000, cost \u00a3194 for 21-day advance return from Sydney. 4WD needed for White Cliffs and Mutawintji.

Watch the world go by in booming Brisbane This stretch of the Queensland coast put the fear of God into its first inhabitants. Convicts from Britain and Ireland deemed too dangerous to keep in the burgeoning colony of Sydney Cove were shipped north to an unknown place with an infernal climate. Being a few miles inland on the Brisbane River, it missed the coastal breezes. Prisoners suffered inhuman accommodation and back-breaking labour in the steamy tropical heat. Neither they nor their gaolers could have dreamed that nearly 200 years later, thousands of people would crave this spot, its mangrove swamps and year-round sunshine. For Brisbane is booming. Property prices are rocketing, businesses are flocking here to set up offices and hold conferences, and service industries can barely keep pace with the influx of holidaymakers. The South Bank cultural complex on the Brisbane River has the fun and style of its London ancestor. Its exhibitions of international and contemporary Australian art and design are making the Sydney galleries keep a close eye on their northern rival. The Botanical Gardens inhabit a loop of the river and make for a good early morning stroll. The French Renaissance architecture of Parliament House is a throwback to colonial times, as are many of the buildings in the city. A heritage trail takes in several of them and is a good starting point for visitors fresh off the plane. The proximity of the city to the Great Barrier Reef, an hour's flight north, has added to its popularity. And the giant casino at the glitzy, gaudy holiday playground of the Gold Coast, two hours south by road, which has given the region the unwelcome nickname of BrisVegas, has boosted the number of visitors. Possibly its greatest asset, however, is the lack of attitude. While Sydney glows with celebrity status and chutzpah, and Melbourne with aloof European style and chic, Brisbane is relaxed and unassuming. Palm trees shading riverside caf\u00e9s rustle in the warm breezes. Elegant, colonial, Queenslander homes sport wide verandas made for lounging and watching the world go by. Where to stay: The sandstone walls of the Conrad International (00 61 7 3306 8888, email: hotelres@conrad.com.au) originally housed the state government cabinet.

Explorers' Inn (00 61 7 3211 3488) downtown is more basic but well regarded. Doubles cost \u00a330. Where to eat: Breakfast at Emporio Il Centro on the riverside, lunch at Indigo in New Farm, and dine out in style at E'cco downtown in Queen Street.

      "body": "<p>You would have to be dead not to feel just a little faint with excitement when you first catch sight of the Aurora, towering in glorious cream-and-gold livery above the heaps of containers on Southampton docks. </p> <p>The brand new Aurora may be nothing more than a 76,000 ton, \u00a3200m floating hotel, restaurant and entertainment complex with a crew of 800 catering for 1,800 passengers -but, oh, what a difference the floating makes. There is something thrilling and glamorous about being at sea, and it doesn't wear off, even after 10 days aboard. On evening three, out in the Bay of Biscay, with a gale blowing up and a swell building, we watched a Euro 2000 match on an enormous TV screen in one of the ship's umpteen bars, with stewards running about with trays of cold beers. The man on the next table said: \"Life doesn't get much better, does it?\" And no one disagreed. </p> <p><strong> Cabins</strong></p> <p> We had a cabin with twin beds and a little balcony. The cabins are not huge but they are luxury; the whole ship is luxury, but I never found a spot I liked better than our cabin. The carpets are thick, the cupboards are huge, the deck chairs on the balcony have plump cotton-covered cushions and the beds are proper hotel beds - firm, with crisp white sheets and massive pillows. Everything is well-finished and sweet-smelling. The bathroom was small, but cleverly designed with huge mirrors, a powerful shower, and two large corner cabinets. </p> <p>Then there was a sofa, coffee table and television (showing four or so videos each day, as well as live footage from the camera at the front of the ship - staff below the waterline use it to check if it's night or day, sunny or rainy). </p> <p>Each cabin has a dedicated steward (shared with 15 other cabins). We had Jerry, a man of saintly patience, who spent 10 days trailing in and out with pots of fresh decaf coffee, extra blankets and fizzy mineral water. These stewards - who are, as is traditional on P&amp;O ships, largely recruited from Goa - do up to nine months at a stretch onboard. They make most of their money - which Jerry, for one, uses to support family in Bombay - on tips (the Guide to Tipping on your dressing table advises you to leave a lump sum in an envelope at the end of the cruise). </p> <p><strong> Sea days</strong></p> <p> Cruising, Brit-style, is still largely the province of white English people of late middle-age or above, and many of the organised activities during days at sea are resolutely un-hip, if not grossly un-PC. In your morning copy of Aurora Today, the ship's newspaper, you will find Masonic meetings (\"Masonic widows should check in at reception\"), bridge classes, coffee mornings, and flower pressing. </p> <p>But none of it is compulsory. By the end of the trip, we still felt we had barely begun to take advantage of such an enormous ship. There's the beauty salon (massages, body wraps and facials, at about \u00a340 a shot), a decent gym with exercise classes (although no yoga), three pools (none large enough to do proper lengths), five-a-side football (every afternoon on sea days), a mini cricket pitch, an outdoor golf simulator (people raved about it), a big room of arcade games, a cinema and a casino. Or you can sunbathe on deck (the pristine, exquisitely-finished wooden deck) or read in the library (a beautiful room with fantastic views of the sea and big leather armchairs). Or you can just lie in bed with the sliding doors to your balcony open and the ocean rushing by. Which is pretty blissful. </p> <p><strong> Days in port</strong></p> <p> We had four days in harbour on our trip. There's a curious pleasure to waking up in the morning, opening your curtains and finding that you're no longer at sea. If the harbour is deep enough, the Aurora draws up alongside a jetty, and all you have to do is get the lift down to deck five, shove a tenner in a machine (pesetas or whatever spew out the bottom) and then trip down the gang plank. If you have to anchor out (which only happened to us in Lanzarote), you're transported ashore by tender (boats that seat about 100 at a time), which is somewhat more tedious. </p> <p>Our first port day was in Vigo, a little Spanish city; we strolled up to the castle at the top of the hill, ate some tapas in a pretty square, had a beer, then went back onboard to watch an afternoon movie. You don't have to show your passport to get on or off, only your \"cruise card\", which doubles as a credit card onboard (the ship is a cash-free zone). </p> <p>Hiring a car at the travel agents onboard is simple and dirt cheap at about \u00a320 for the day. In Lanzarote, we drove up to the island's fabulous volcanic national park - frustratingly you're not allowed to walk about and poke at the lava - and then found a beach with translucent water and white sand. In Tenerife (which is a stunning island, with gloriously jagged volcanic peaks: why does no one ever tell you that?), we drove up high and wished we could be there longer - in fact, we swore to go back. </p> <p>If you don't like doing your own thing, there are lots of organised trips. In Madeira, a much lusher island than the previous two, we went on an off-road Jeep trip up into the densely-vegetated mountains.

Because the Aurora waits for no man - or woman, or child.

You get two casual-wear evenings (during which everyone wears black tie), a couple of informal evenings (during which everyone wears black tie) and a clutch of formal evenings (during which, somehow, people seem to go a notch above black tie and no one is allowed to take their jackets off in the bars, even at 2am). The \"ladies\", as we are frequently described in Aurora Today, drip with gold and black lace, the men with dickie bows and cufflinks. </p> <p>Weather permitting, the evening begins with a lap around deck seven, the promenade deck, a perfect sunset, a glass of champagne and then a four-course supper. </p> <p>Later, you could go to the show (they have musicals, comedians, talent shows, karaoke; whatever's your bag) or a film, a late-night drink and maybe even the disco. If it's not too windy and the pools aren't spontaneously emptying themselves, the stars are fantastic out on deck. </p> <p>And all this is hugely enlivened by the Opening of External Doors Palaver - as soon as the ship's up to full speed (about 24 knots), opening a door to the deck has the same kind of impact as opening an external door on a passenger jet at 35,000ft: panic, hurricane-force winds, people in evening wear flying through the air, grappling for a hand-hold on anything that's nailed down - high drama. Then, just as abruptly, the door slams shut and all is normal again: you can only tell it ever happened by looking at your hair. </p> <p><strong> Eating</strong></p> <p> Very popular; very easy to do. Basically, you can eat at any time of day and night and it's free. If you don't want to attend the formal sittings in the two main dining rooms, you can do room service or eat in Caf\u00e9 Bordeaux, a 24-hour bistro (which is great and lets you smoke, unlike the other restaurants). During the day, there are buffets or barbecues on deck. Our favourite evening meal was an Indian buffet. </p> <p>The food's not five-star, but they don't aim for that: they aim for no complaints.

They play games, charge about and are well shielded from any interference from adult relatives. They go to the early sitting at supper (6pm) and at night children and babies can be left in the kids' area, on a cute little line of beds, until 2am. </p> <p><strong> Seasickness</strong></p> <p> About 3% of us are particularly susceptible, apparently, but even in quite stormy seas the Aurora hardly budges.

Many people said they had managed to secure a 40% discount from Teletext or similar, and then, of course, everything on board (except alcohol, the duty-free shops and day-trips) is included, which is pretty good value if you do the posh dinner-plus-show thing every night.

      "bodyText": "You would have to be dead not to feel just a little faint with excitement when you first catch sight of the Aurora, towering in glorious cream-and-gold livery above the heaps of containers on Southampton docks. The brand new Aurora may be nothing more than a 76,000 ton, \u00a3200m floating hotel, restaurant and entertainment complex with a crew of 800 catering for 1,800 passengers -but, oh, what a difference the floating makes. There is something thrilling and glamorous about being at sea, and it doesn't wear off, even after 10 days aboard. On evening three, out in the Bay of Biscay, with a gale blowing up and a swell building, we watched a Euro 2000 match on an enormous TV screen in one of the ship's umpteen bars, with stewards running about with trays of cold beers. The man on the next table said: \"Life doesn't get much better, does it?\" And no one disagreed. Cabins We had a cabin with twin beds and a little balcony. The cabins are not huge but they are luxury; the whole ship is luxury, but I never found a spot I liked better than our cabin. The carpets are thick, the cupboards are huge, the deck chairs on the balcony have plump cotton-covered cushions and the beds are proper hotel beds - firm, with crisp white sheets and massive pillows. Everything is well-finished and sweet-smelling. The bathroom was small, but cleverly designed with huge mirrors, a powerful shower, and two large corner cabinets. Then there was a sofa, coffee table and television (showing four or so videos each day, as well as live footage from the camera at the front of the ship - staff below the waterline use it to check if it's night or day, sunny or rainy). Each cabin has a dedicated steward (shared with 15 other cabins). We had Jerry, a man of saintly patience, who spent 10 days trailing in and out with pots of fresh decaf coffee, extra blankets and fizzy mineral water. These stewards - who are, as is traditional on P&amp;O ships, largely recruited from Goa - do up to nine months at a stretch onboard. They make most of their money - which Jerry, for one, uses to support family in Bombay - on tips (the Guide to Tipping on your dressing table advises you to leave a lump sum in an envelope at the end of the cruise). Sea days Cruising, Brit-style, is still largely the province of white English people of late middle-age or above, and many of the organised activities during days at sea are resolutely un-hip, if not grossly un-PC. In your morning copy of Aurora Today, the ship's newspaper, you will find Masonic meetings (\"Masonic widows should check in at reception\"), bridge classes, coffee mornings, and flower pressing. But none of it is compulsory. By the end of the trip, we still felt we had barely begun to take advantage of such an enormous ship. There's the beauty salon (massages, body wraps and facials, at about \u00a340 a shot), a decent gym with exercise classes (although no yoga), three pools (none large enough to do proper lengths), five-a-side football (every afternoon on sea days), a mini cricket pitch, an outdoor golf simulator (people raved about it), a big room of arcade games, a cinema and a casino. Or you can sunbathe on deck (the pristine, exquisitely-finished wooden deck) or read in the library (a beautiful room with fantastic views of the sea and big leather armchairs). Or you can just lie in bed with the sliding doors to your balcony open and the ocean rushing by. Which is pretty blissful. Days in port We had four days in harbour on our trip. There's a curious pleasure to waking up in the morning, opening your curtains and finding that you're no longer at sea. If the harbour is deep enough, the Aurora draws up alongside a jetty, and all you have to do is get the lift down to deck five, shove a tenner in a machine (pesetas or whatever spew out the bottom) and then trip down the gang plank. If you have to anchor out (which only happened to us in Lanzarote), you're transported ashore by tender (boats that seat about 100 at a time), which is somewhat more tedious. Our first port day was in Vigo, a little Spanish city; we strolled up to the castle at the top of the hill, ate some tapas in a pretty square, had a beer, then went back onboard to watch an afternoon movie. You don't have to show your passport to get on or off, only your \"cruise card\", which doubles as a credit card onboard (the ship is a cash-free zone). Hiring a car at the travel agents onboard is simple and dirt cheap at about \u00a320 for the day. In Lanzarote, we drove up to the island's fabulous volcanic national park - frustratingly you're not allowed to walk about and poke at the lava - and then found a beach with translucent water and white sand. In Tenerife (which is a stunning island, with gloriously jagged volcanic peaks: why does no one ever tell you that?), we drove up high and wished we could be there longer - in fact, we swore to go back. If you don't like doing your own thing, there are lots of organised trips. In Madeira, a much lusher island than the previous two, we went on an off-road Jeep trip up into the densely-vegetated mountains. Again, we vowed to go back - the German guide said it has the prettiest walking in Europe - although the trip itself was all driving; not enough stops and too much high-speed swerving around and bashing up and down.

In Madeira, one of our fellow passengers was fortunate that the captain of the pilot boat agreed to rush him out to the ship before she had sailed too far from the jetty (this is a ship that, in an emergency-stop scenario, takes almost a mile to draw to a shuddering halt). The no-waiting rule goes for the crew, too; one of the Aurora's officers, resplendent in his whites (gold epaulettes, Richard Gere-style cap, the whole gig), told us that he had once left seven laundrymen behind in some port, which apparently caused no end of hassle. Evenings These are a big deal on Aurora; the whole point really for many passengers.

Warhol's paintings of the famous, infamous and unknown, derived from newspaper cuttings, film stills and his own Polaroid snapshots, constitute an unrivalled gallery of modern portraits. He seems to have set out to document his own time systematically, as did the Victorian portrait painter George Frederic Watts, who immortalised eminent contemporaries in his Hall of Fame.

Before his decline into reclusive gluttony, he brought the same raw, spontaneous energy to postwar acting - beginning with his explosive Broadway performance as Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire in 1947 - that Jackson Pollock and Jack Kerouac brought to painting and writing. </p> <p><strong> Distinguishing features:</strong> With his hat cocked, bike ready to go and leathers defined in deep shadow, Marlon is a sex god. Specifically, he is Warhol's sex god. There's an acknowledgement in this painting of the true nature of cinematic spectatorship: pure desire. Warhol's own films, which were his main work by the time he produced this portrait, are full of rapt sexual looking. </p> <p>Here, the phallic bike and the arrogant but tender look of Brando's large, soft face and open lips emphasise sexual availability; in the context of 60s Manhattan he is wearing an explicitly gay form of dress. This sexually ambiguous potential was already there at the core of Brando's performances: Elia Kazan, Brando's director in A Streetcar Named Desire, noted Brando's \"soft, yearning girlish side\". </p> <p>This painting, in which the artist makes his own longing explicit, is an attempt to freeze time and preserve beauty. Warhol began making portraits of Brando in the early 60s when this image was yesterday's pop culture. It's a still from Stanley Kramer's film The Wild One (1954), in which Brando played the leader of a biker gang who descend on a small town (\"What are you rebelling against?\" \"What have you got?\"). By 1966 this version of rebellion already looked quaint. Brando himself was exploring political rejections of the US mainstream. Meanwhile, Warhol's Factory took leather-clad outsiderdom to kinky extremes, with Warhol's protege, poet Gerard Malanga, appearing in black leather and cracking a whip alongside the Velvet Underground. </p> <p>Marlon is one of the 50s pop icons memorialised in Warhol's classic portraits of the 60s, stars whose glamour was a bit shopworn and melancholy. Elvis entered Warhol's art just as he slipped out of teen culture; Marilyn Monroe a few weeks after her death. Warhol's series of Marlon portraits, like the others, were reproduced from photographs on to canvas by pushing paint through a specially made silkscreen. This silkscreen technique is often seen as blandly mechanical, but in Warhol's art it turns out to be the opposite, creating the effect of an intense, even obsessive desire to preserve an image. The translation from the flat still to the monumental scale and drenched colour of Warhol's painting gives Marlon a god-like status. </p> <p> <strong>Inspirations and influences: </strong>Antecedents of Warhol's portraits include Edgar Degas's experiments with the camera - painting faces from 19th-century photographs and giving them a frozen look. But his most significant predecessor was the American John Singer Sargent (1856-1925), whose portraits of society figures such as Madame X (1894) glisten with a very pop-art glamour and sexuality. Warhol's influence on the portrait is incalculable: you could list everyone from David Hockney to Sam Taylor-Wood, but perhaps his most significant disciple is the German artist Gerhardt Richter. </p> <p> <strong>Where is it?</strong> History, Memory, Society galleries, Tate Modern, London SE1 (020-7887 8000). </p>",

But his most significant predecessor was the American John Singer Sargent (1856-1925), whose portraits of society figures such as Madame X (1894) glisten with a very pop-art glamour and sexuality. Warhol's influence on the portrait is incalculable: you could list everyone from David Hockney to Sam Taylor-Wood, but perhaps his most significant disciple is the German artist Gerhardt Richter.

We would still have seen the Pyramids, the Valley of the Kings, Karnak, Deir al-Bahri and the Egyptian Museum, and probably ridden a camel, drifted down the Nile in a felucca and snorkeled in the Red Sea. But Tricia and I were modern girls, 23 years old and doggedly independent. Wisely or otherwise, we dismissed all package tours with deepest scorn. </p> <p>We bought a Lonely Planet guide, booked a British Airways flight (\u00a3300 with an under-26 card), exchanged a series of e-mails with the proprietor of the Berlin Hotel and, without being in any way prepared for the reality, found ourselves in central Cairo. </p> <p>It is not a desirable place to spend any amount of time. At least not for a woman. Think the grottiest bits of South London, but hotter, smellier, shabbier, muddier and more crowded, with a driving style to terrify Parisians, and the creepiest men on Earth. Aside from the vast and bewildering, but unmissable, museum, we stuck to the outskirts. </p> <p>And thanks to a general inability to distinguish between under-26 and student cards, we paid half price for monuments across the country: \u00a33 in Giza and \u00a31 each for Saqqara and Dahshur. </p> <p>For \u00a310, we spent a day sunbathing and swimming at the Oberoi Mena House hotel (slap bang next to Giza plateau and at least \u00a3150 a night). It was worth every piastre to lift my dripping head out of the cool water, open my eyes and re-register that, yes, those big triangular things really were the Pyramids. </p> <p>The night train to Luxor (if that isn't an Agatha Christie novel, it should be) took 10 hours but only cost \u00a312 first class. Smaller and quieter than Cairo, Luxor was also cheaper: \u00a312 for a double room with - utter bliss - an en-suite shower-room. </p> <p>We saw Luxor Temple at sunset for \u00a312. Karnak, in the glaring light of day, was even more breathtaking - vast and unbelievable. We reached it by horse-drawn carriage for \u00a31.20 and paid \u00a32 admission. </p> <p>Refusing overpriced hotel tours, we got around the West Bank by taxi (about \u00a31.20 a journey) and did the Valley of the Kings (\u00a32, another \u00a34 for Tutankhamun's empty tomb) and Deir al-Bahri (\u00a31.20) in one very hot morning. Then we paid \u00a36 to be sailed inexpertly up the Nile in a felucca at sunset. </p> <p>We reached Sharm el-Sheikh by bus to Hurghada and ferry across the Red Sea, \u00a32.50 and \u00a325 respectively. A surreal place, hotels springing up from desert and industrial wasteland, and a beach next to a building site. But three-star (ish) accommodation cost less than \u00a330 a night for the two of us. </p> <p>For three days, we sunbathed, swam and snorkeled with astonishingly coloured fish, before catching the bus to Cairo for \u00a310. In the evenings, we explored the gloriously tacky tourist promenade at Na'ama Bay. </p> <p><strong> The pros</strong><br> </p> <p> We saw what we wanted to see and changed our plans when we changed our minds. At the Valley of the Kings, we watched with incredulous pity as tour groups poured out of coaches, were hurried to the nearest tombs, squashed all inside at once, lectured in top-decibel Italian/Japanese/ English for a few minutes and swept out again. The tombs are not big; I don't suppose most of them saw anything other than a few (admittedly lovely) roof paintings. Various posed snapshots later, they were back into the bus and off to the next site. </p> <p>We slipped in, as far as possible, between groups, and then abandoned the tourist trail altogether to hike to Deir al-Bahri. Five minutes' climb and we were alone; 15 and we were round the side of the hill, gasping with heat, exhaustion and amazement as the golden, desert mountains stretched out around us. And not another soul in sight, at least until an old man and a boy emerged from a cave halfway down to the temple, brandishing plastic gods and demanding Egyptian pounds. </p> <p>From the sides of the valley, we had a terrorists' eye view of the temple, scene of the 1997 massacre - spectacularly lovely but terribly exposed - and reached the bottom just as yet another coach swept up. Recognising some of its occupants from the Valley of the Kings, we felt knackered, but complacent. </p> <p>The local ferry across the river in Luxor was not only incredibly cheap (20p each way), but also a rare opportunity to be among the locals without being hassled. Although we were the only foreigners on the boat, we were completely and delightedly ignored, squashed in between a large woman with a basket and a young couple who were interested only in talking, shyly, to each other. They looked about 12. </p> <p>The Ritz it ain't, but the Berlin Hotel in Cairo was a bargain at\u00a316 a night for a double room. And it did afford us one glorious day in the outskirts of the city. George, the hotel driver, escorted the two of us and an Aussie girl to Giza, Saqqara and Dahshur for a mere \u00a36 each, and proved a happy exception to the letchers and hustlers who made up most of our Egyptian male acquaintance. </p> <p>Reassured by his urbane presence, we bartered with a large stable owner and paid \u00a310 each for two hours on camelback. Our guide led us out into the desert until the tourists faded away and we had a glorious view of the three Pyramids in a row. </p> <p>In the late afternoon, worn out by sightseeing, we drank tea in a perfume shop tucked down a side street in Giza. A place of half-light, dark-red plush cushions, multi-coloured glass and exotic smells, perfect for the opening scene of a Bond film, and run by one of George's friends. Scents were fetched and sprayed on demand until I had no space left on my arms. When Tricia weakened, George was on hand to request \"special price\" after \"special price\". She paid \u00a330 for three deliciously-packaged bottles. </p> <p>Later, while crowds below us paid more than \u00a36 a head to witness the Giza Sound and Light Show from a coach-packed piece of Tarmac, we saw it for nothing from a stable roof at the edge of the plateau. Camels slept noisily in the yard below, George was drinking beer in doorway with the stable owner, and a man was selling watermelons in the street. </p> <p><strong> The cons</strong><br> </p> <p> We paid a lot for our indepen dence - in money, which we didn't have, or in time and effort. We wasted a morning getting train tickets to Luxor, and once headed off to Coptic Cairo for an afternoon only to find the much-recommended Hanging Church closed for refurbishment. Our experiences of public transport were interesting, but hardly restful. And we were hassled. Constantly. </p> <p>The hustlers swarmed around us at Cairo airport and Luxor station; we were chased up the road by felucca sailors and carriage drivers, and practically dragged into shops. The downside of having no tour guide was that pseudo-guides attached themselves to us unasked, pointing out the obvious, ignoring our requests to explore alone, and then demanding excessive baksheesh when we tried to escape. </p> <p>We expended an awful lot of energy in not being cheated. A taxi driver in Sinai took us to a completely different hotel from the one we asked for, ignoring our protests and heading purposefully inside in search of commission. We jumped out of the taxi. He chased us. We found a friendlier driver and scrambled into his cab. Massive arguments ensued with the original driver, who stuck his threatening, brown-toothed face into the cab and demanded money. We refused, but were worried. A bigger row developed in Arabic, with several other taxi drivers putting in their two piastres' worth before he was forcibly removed. </p> <p>And we were frighteningly alone. Women in a man's culture, our complaints were ignored, or dismissed. In the Palermo Resort in Sharm el-Sheikh, money disappeared from our (locked) room, and the manager did nothing until Tricia went to the tourist police. Then \u00a316 was grudgingly handed over, on condition that she didn't make a formal report. Later that night, we returned from Na'ama Bay to find our door wide open. \"No problem, this is a very safe hotel,\" the manager insisted. We didn't think so. After a tearful and unhelpful trip to the police station, we moved to the next door hotel in the early hours of the morning. </p> <p>Worst of all was the incessant male attention. With their own women closely guarded, and an impression of Westerners fed by Hollywood movies, many Egyptians regard Western girls as available, to say the least. Especially two young women travelling alone. No matter how conservatively we dressed, we were shouted at and accosted whenever we stepped outside. It could have been funny (\"I miss you like the desert miss the rain,\" one individual in Sinai informed us) had it not been so constant, and so intimidating. </p> <p>We learned to avoid crowds, or ever getting within touching distance, because they took it as permission. We were followed through Cairo for half an hour on our first day and, even in Sinai, supposedly used to tourists, we couldn't put so much as a toe in the pool without staff emerging from every corner of the hotel to stare. </p> <p>After two weeks, a BA plane, with its English stewards and English tourists, never seemed so inviting. I'm a modern girl, so I hate to say this, but I wouldn't go back without a big strong man. Or make that an entire rugby team.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It's four in the morning, nearly pitch-black, minus 20C, and I am inching my way up a scree slope 5,000 metres in the air. I have been walking for three hours, and it's another three to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa. </p> <p>The iron band around my head is tightening, the nausea is rising, black spots flash in front of my eyes and my breathing comes fast and shallow. As I battle against the rapidly worsening altitude sickness, I can no longer remember why I am here. </p> <p>With the arrival of dawn, I should be jubilant, but the summit still seems insurmountable. Then I see, 50m above me, the people I have walked with for the past five days. I heave myself over the last boulders. </p> <p>The relief, as I stand looking at the ice fields on the summit, is overwhelming and it is only later that any sense of achievement hits me. This has been the most physically demanding experience of my life, not a holiday. </p> <p>We have been climbing Kilimanjaro the hard way: renouncing the huts, canteens and running water of the Merangu or the \"Coca-Cola\" route - so-called because the soft drink can be bought all the way up - and camping each night above the clouds in sub-zero temperatures. </p> <p>For six days, we have tried to keep clean with just half a washing-up bowl of water; drunk from tarns flavoured with algae; and wrapped ourselves in layer upon layer of dust-caked garments to try and keep warm at night. The pain of altitude sickness has been unlike anything previously encountered, with headaches that seem to paralyse your spirit. But it has crystalised my priorities: all that is important is water, warmth, food, and that my boyfriend and I make it safely back down the mountain. </p> <p><strong> The route</strong><br> </p> <p> We've chosen to follow the little-used Naremoru route, a track that snakes up the north side of the mountain, starting close to the Kenyan border, before encompassing Mawenzi, a 5,100m volcano to the east of Kibo, the final part of Kilimanjaro and the toughest part of the ascent. </p> <p>According to our travel company, Exodus, we should have been taking the Rongai Route, described in the brochure as \"the easiest of all the routes\". But when we arrive, our rep, Edward, tells us it is closed because Somali bandits have been ambushing unsuspecting trekkers. </p> <p>Initially, the Naremoru is less steep than the start of the Coca-Cola route (via which we descend), and takes six days instead of five - to aid acclimatisation and improve our chances of getting to the summit. But it is longer and more gruelling since it involves camping, and has none of the infrastructure of the southern route. </p> <p>If you fall ill on the Coca-Cola route, there is medical assistance at each of the huts and the track is wide enough for a Land Rover ambulance to go up to 4,700m, the bottom of the Kibo crater. If you fall ill on the Naremoru, you have to struggle for four days until you reach Kibo, or face a lonely descent alone with a guide. On the plus side, the Naremoru turns out to be far more unspoilt: each day, some 300 tourists clamber up the Coca-Cola, whereas only the seven in our group went up the Naremoru each day, joined at points by a four-strong French group. </p> <p>And the scenery is more wild and varied: over the four days to Kibo, we pass from forests, heather and moorland to the barren but spectacular crags of Mawenzi tarn, and the lunar desert of The Saddle - the lava-covered expanse between Mawenzi and Kibo. </p> <p>The final ascent is scree; the summit, rock and ice fields; and the descent - via the Coca-Cola route -is more moorland before miles of rainforest. </p> <p><strong> The climb</strong><br> </p> <p> The actual walking, we discover as we begin climbing on the first day, is not particularly arduous. But then, by our first evening we have only climbed to 2,600m - from the 1,800m starting point - and altitude will not affect us for at least another 1,000m. </p> <p>The nagging headache - faint at first - only begins towards the end of the second day when we have climbed a further 1,000m to 3,600m and camped in a supposedly sheltered valley, where the wind threatens to blow our tent down. </p> <p>By this stage, though, the beauty of our surroundings has taken hold, and our bodies have relaxed into a rhythm reached through the day's eight hours of walking. The sun - fierce so near to the Equator and increasingly-intense as we rise higher - beats strongly; the clouds spread above the plains of Kenya to our left, and, to our right, towers our ice-capped challenge: Kibo. </p> <p>We have also relaxed with each other and by the time the effects of altitude deepen on the third day - as we rise to 4,300m at the spectacular Mawenzi Tarn - we are looking out for one another: no longer strangers but potential friends bound by a unique experience we suspect will grow harder. </p> <p>There are three of us in our twenties: myself, my boyfriend Phil, and Sian, a well-travelled 23-year-old who is finding the climb tough, throwing up through altitude, but still managing to be cheerful. </p> <p>Then there is Terry, and his son Tom, who celebrates his 16th birthday on the last day of the trek; Vince, a 45-year-old who has been quietly obsessed with climbing the mountain since seeing a BBC documentary six years ago; and Donald, a 68-year-old who is deceptively fit and finally lets slip that he completed the West Coast Trail - a Canadian feat of endurance - just a month earlier. </p> <p>The cold begins to bite as we spend our fourth day walking from Mawenzi to the mountain's first volcanic peak of Kibo. Our shorts and T-shirts have been swapped for down jackets, layers of trousers and fleece hats and the wind is harsh as we spend seven hours slowly edging ourselves across The Saddle in preparation for the final ascent. </p> <p>That night, we barely sleep, aware that at midnight we will be woken to begin the final six-hours, by far the most arduous part of the trek, and the bit we have been dreading. \"It's purgatory,\" a friend who successfully climbed the 5,685m to Gilman's Point two years ago had warned - and she wasn't exaggerating. </p> <p>For those six hours, as I walked in a world marked by Vince's ankles before me and Phil's voice behind me, I pushed myself harder than I thought possible - and I still couldn't work out why I was doing it. </p> <p>The reason came later, as our plane flew out of Kilimanjaro and alongside the mountain - we had been to the top of a continent. And we felt invincible.</p> <p><strong>Getting fit and buying the kit </strong></p> <p>Exodus warns that Kilimanjaro is a \"long and hard trek\" and that \"if you are not prepared to exercise and take walks regularly, you are unlikely to make it to the summit\". However, you don't need to be stunningly fit, and some of the Americans sweating their way up to Kibo certainly weren't. </p> <p>The main problem was always going to be altitude not aerobic fitness. Over five months, I tried to work out up to three times a week at the gym, combining aerobic exercise - cycling, running and spin classes - with walking on a treadmill set on the steepest incline.</p> <p>My boyfriend, Phil, and I also managed a few aerobically-taxing walks, including the hilliest part of the South Downs Way, from Buriton to Cocking, and a 14-mile stretch from Sidmouth to Branscombe and back in Devon - a walk that involves scaling six sheer cliffs, returning each time to the sea.

      "bodyText": "It's four in the morning, nearly pitch-black, minus 20C, and I am inching my way up a scree slope 5,000 metres in the air. I have been walking for three hours, and it's another three to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa. The iron band around my head is tightening, the nausea is rising, black spots flash in front of my eyes and my breathing comes fast and shallow. As I battle against the rapidly worsening altitude sickness, I can no longer remember why I am here. With the arrival of dawn, I should be jubilant, but the summit still seems insurmountable. Then I see, 50m above me, the people I have walked with for the past five days. I heave myself over the last boulders. The relief, as I stand looking at the ice fields on the summit, is overwhelming and it is only later that any sense of achievement hits me. This has been the most physically demanding experience of my life, not a holiday. We have been climbing Kilimanjaro the hard way: renouncing the huts, canteens and running water of the Merangu or the \"Coca-Cola\" route - so-called because the soft drink can be bought all the way up - and camping each night above the clouds in sub-zero temperatures. For six days, we have tried to keep clean with just half a washing-up bowl of water; drunk from tarns flavoured with algae; and wrapped ourselves in layer upon layer of dust-caked garments to try and keep warm at night. The pain of altitude sickness has been unlike anything previously encountered, with headaches that seem to paralyse your spirit. But it has crystalised my priorities: all that is important is water, warmth, food, and that my boyfriend and I make it safely back down the mountain. The route We've chosen to follow the little-used Naremoru route, a track that snakes up the north side of the mountain, starting close to the Kenyan border, before encompassing Mawenzi, a 5,100m volcano to the east of Kibo, the final part of Kilimanjaro and the toughest part of the ascent. According to our travel company, Exodus, we should have been taking the Rongai Route, described in the brochure as \"the easiest of all the routes\". But when we arrive, our rep, Edward, tells us it is closed because Somali bandits have been ambushing unsuspecting trekkers. Initially, the Naremoru is less steep than the start of the Coca-Cola route (via which we descend), and takes six days instead of five - to aid acclimatisation and improve our chances of getting to the summit. But it is longer and more gruelling since it involves camping, and has none of the infrastructure of the southern route. If you fall ill on the Coca-Cola route, there is medical assistance at each of the huts and the track is wide enough for a Land Rover ambulance to go up to 4,700m, the bottom of the Kibo crater. If you fall ill on the Naremoru, you have to struggle for four days until you reach Kibo, or face a lonely descent alone with a guide. On the plus side, the Naremoru turns out to be far more unspoilt: each day, some 300 tourists clamber up the Coca-Cola, whereas only the seven in our group went up the Naremoru each day, joined at points by a four-strong French group. And the scenery is more wild and varied: over the four days to Kibo, we pass from forests, heather and moorland to the barren but spectacular crags of Mawenzi tarn, and the lunar desert of The Saddle - the lava-covered expanse between Mawenzi and Kibo. The final ascent is scree; the summit, rock and ice fields; and the descent - via the Coca-Cola route -is more moorland before miles of rainforest. The climb The actual walking, we discover as we begin climbing on the first day, is not particularly arduous. But then, by our first evening we have only climbed to 2,600m - from the 1,800m starting point - and altitude will not affect us for at least another 1,000m. The nagging headache - faint at first - only begins towards the end of the second day when we have climbed a further 1,000m to 3,600m and camped in a supposedly sheltered valley, where the wind threatens to blow our tent down. By this stage, though, the beauty of our surroundings has taken hold, and our bodies have relaxed into a rhythm reached through the day's eight hours of walking. The sun - fierce so near to the Equator and increasingly-intense as we rise higher - beats strongly; the clouds spread above the plains of Kenya to our left, and, to our right, towers our ice-capped challenge: Kibo. We have also relaxed with each other and by the time the effects of altitude deepen on the third day - as we rise to 4,300m at the spectacular Mawenzi Tarn - we are looking out for one another: no longer strangers but potential friends bound by a unique experience we suspect will grow harder. There are three of us in our twenties: myself, my boyfriend Phil, and Sian, a well-travelled 23-year-old who is finding the climb tough, throwing up through altitude, but still managing to be cheerful. Then there is Terry, and his son Tom, who celebrates his 16th birthday on the last day of the trek; Vince, a 45-year-old who has been quietly obsessed with climbing the mountain since seeing a BBC documentary six years ago; and Donald, a 68-year-old who is deceptively fit and finally lets slip that he completed the West Coast Trail - a Canadian feat of endurance - just a month earlier. The cold begins to bite as we spend our fourth day walking from Mawenzi to the mountain's first volcanic peak of Kibo. Our shorts and T-shirts have been swapped for down jackets, layers of trousers and fleece hats and the wind is harsh as we spend seven hours slowly edging ourselves across The Saddle in preparation for the final ascent. That night, we barely sleep, aware that at midnight we will be woken to begin the final six-hours, by far the most arduous part of the trek, and the bit we have been dreading. \"It's purgatory,\" a friend who successfully climbed the 5,685m to Gilman's Point two years ago had warned - and she wasn't exaggerating. For those six hours, as I walked in a world marked by Vince's ankles before me and Phil's voice behind me, I pushed myself harder than I thought possible - and I still couldn't work out why I was doing it. The reason came later, as our plane flew out of Kilimanjaro and alongside the mountain - we had been to the top of a continent. And we felt invincible. Getting fit and buying the kit Exodus warns that Kilimanjaro is a \"long and hard trek\" and that \"if you are not prepared to exercise and take walks regularly, you are unlikely to make it to the summit\". However, you don't need to be stunningly fit, and some of the Americans sweating their way up to Kibo certainly weren't. The main problem was always going to be altitude not aerobic fitness. Over five months, I tried to work out up to three times a week at the gym, combining aerobic exercise - cycling, running and spin classes - with walking on a treadmill set on the steepest incline. My boyfriend, Phil, and I also managed a few aerobically-taxing walks, including the hilliest part of the South Downs Way, from Buriton to Cocking, and a 14-mile stretch from Sidmouth to Branscombe and back in Devon - a walk that involves scaling six sheer cliffs, returning each time to the sea. We practised walking in the heat - plodding at 35C - after dragging our boots to the mountains of Crete. Cost of the gear It's an extortionate business, but worth investing in. Some of the kit - like my water-proof jacket - was top-of-the-range other bits less so. Boots and outer clothing are the priorities. Boots (Gore-Tex lined): \u00a3140.

      "bodyText": "The Metropolitan police were embroiled in another extraordinary race row yesterday when one of the force's most senior officers pointedly refused to apologise to a Sikh sergeant cleared by an employment tribunal of sending race hate mail to colleagues. Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, the head of Scotland Yard's racial and violent crimes task force, insisted it would not be appropriate to apologise to Gurpal Virdi, 41, when there were further hearings on his case in the pipeline. The tribunal found no evidence for the allegations that he sent the hate mail because he had been passed over for promotion. It also found he was the victim of racial discrimination during the inquiry. The refusal to say sorry was condemned by Mr Virdi and by members of the Met's independent advisory group (IAG), which described his treatment by the force as \"disgraceful\", \"appalling\" and \"a disaster\". It now seems inevitable that Mr Virdi will receive a big settlement, possibly exceeding the \u00a31m paid in June to Det Con Sarah Locker, who sued for sexual and racial discrimination. The Virdi case is undermining the Met's race relations strategy at a time when the force is desperate to show that it has changed fundamentally since the Macpherson report into the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation was published last year. Mr Virdi was sacked in March after an internal disciplinary panel of three senior officers ruled that he had sent racist hate mail to himself and other black and Asian staff at Ealing and Hanwell police stations, west London, in December 1997 and January 1998. One of the letters read: \"Not wanted. Keep the police force white. Leave now or else.\" It was signed NF. Scotland Yard's complaints investigation branch discovered that the letters had been written on Mr Virdi's computer. During a raid at his house, officers found envelopes identical to the ones used to post the letters. Mr Virdi, who had an unblemished record in 16 years of service, has consistently denied the charges. He claimed he was not at the station when the letters were written and believes he was set up because he challenged white officers who he thought were apathetic about racially motivated crimes. In an interview with the Guardian, he said the idea that he had sent the letters because he had been overlooked for promotion was \"ridiculous\". Backed by the commission for racial equality, he took his case to an employment tribunal which ruled two weeks ago that he had been treated differently to a white female officer, PC Jackie Bachelor, who was also a suspect in the investigation. It condemned a six-hour search of Mr Virdi's home by an anti-terrorist squad and claimed the Met attempted to entrap him in a taped interview in February 1998. Yesterday, the IAG, set up in January 1999 to review the Met's handling of racist crime, heaped more embarrassment on the force with its own review of the Virdi case. It said the Met had conducted \"a disgraceful investigation and high-profile character assassination\". It said the inquiry had been flawed and biased and concluded that the verdict of the Met's disciplinary panel was unsafe. An appeal against Mr Virdi's dismissal has been launched and a second employment tribunal will meet in October to consider whether he was unfairly sacked. During a tense press conference at Scotland Yard yesterday, members of the IAG said Mr Virdi deserved a public apology for \"the horrendous experience he and his family had been put through\" and demanded that the officers responsible for his victimisation should be brought to account. But when Mr Grieve spoke on behalf of the police, he said: \"Am I going to apologise? The answer is no.\" He added: \"I have deep sympathy with the situation he finds himself in but it is not appropriate to apologise part way through a legal process.\" Mr Virdi, who was sitting in front of Mr Grieve during the press conference, said the commissioner's remarks were typical of the attitude of senior officers at the Met. \"This is not about money, it never has been.

He expressed concern over the findings of a University of Ulster report which showed that many ethnic minority groups experience racism in the workplace and schools as a way of life.

Mr McGuinness said: \"Racism and racist bullying is intolerable and has no place in our schools. \"My department will continue to work with members of minority ethnic communities to ... continue to improve our service.\" The report makes a number of recommendations to government departments, schools and the RUC on how to meet ethnic groups' needs.

      "body": "<b>Dear Terry,</b> <br> At the risk of sounding like a conservative old so-and-so, let me say why gay relationships should get more formal recognition. <p>At the moment, I am allowed a boyfriend; I can go to dinner parties with him, and maybe even the office Christmas party. Friends may even come to think of us as a couple. But relationships are one thing; marriage gives something extra. It signals a mutual expectation that our relationship is more committed and more durable than a casual fling. And it tells the world to treat us as such: to invite us to dinner parties together, to support and counsel us and even not to lead us into temptation.</p> <p>And on those inevitable bad days when my partner and I feel like we want to break up, the sheer cost of having got married, and of having publicly affirmed our commitment to each other, would certainly make us think twice about taking any precipitous action. Marriage helps couples rise above the day-to-day challenges of staying together - and that can help them find fulfilment as a result.</p> <p>If marriage didn't exist, someone would invent it. And most human societies have developed arrangements for binding individuals together in reasonably secure relationships. In our society, most people choose to join the marriage institution, for all its flaws. Do you really want us to be excluded? </p> <p> All the best,<br> Evan</p> <p><b>Dear Evan,</b><br> What exactly is marriage going to bring to your relationship that isn't there already? Rules, that's what. And as heterosexuals have discovered to their cost, swearing to abide by a lot of unreasonable rules, invented by a misogynistic and homophobic church, can bring nothing but trouble.</p> <p>The fundamental advantage gay relationships have over marriage is that we can tailor them precisely to our requirements. We can make it up as we go along, change with the circumstances and go with the flow. We don't have to promise sexual exclusivity or to share our worldly goods if we don't want to. We don't have to live together if it's inconvenient or unwanted. We don't have to struggle to fit into someone else's idea of what is the \"right\" way to do things. We yield that flexibility at our peril.</p> <p>If we want our friends and families to support and respect our relationships then we have to convince them that we are serious about each other. Only by observing our behaviour to one another will they know we are truly committed. A certificate bestowed by some institution is meaningless as a measure of our love.</p> <p>Certainly marriage is still a popular institution: most people give it a shot at some time in their life. And look how many of them are now clamouring to get out of it. When judged against common sense, it's a ludicrous way to proceed. Expecting two people to stay together for 50 or 60 years is not only unreasonable, it's positively cruel.</p> <p>Best wishes, <br> Terry</p> <p><b>Dear Terry,</b><br> I am not arguing that marriage should be compulsory - only that it should be an option.</p> <p>We both know plenty of people who want to \"go with the flow\", as you put it. Maybe we all do to some extent. But there are plenty of others who find the opportunity to fly more scary than staying on the ground. Some want rules to guide them and are happy to constrain their behaviour, particularly if doing so extracts a commitment from someone else to do the same.</p> <p>Few of us like short-tenure housing arrangements; or temp-agency employment contracts. Why on earth should companionship arrangements be taken so much less seriously? Some flourish with freedom; others can't function until they've secured stability.</p> <p>Of course, no one would argue that getting a marriage certificate guarantees a successful relationship; or that it absolves partners of having to negotiate satisfying arrangements. But it does at least tend to offer an off-the-shelf commitment on the part of both parties to invest a great deal into making the relationship work - and to try to grow together. It's not for all. But for many, the freedom you describe is more tyrannical than the spouse.</p> <p>Yours, <br> Evan</p> <p><b>Dear Evan,</b><br> The statistics speak for themselves - marriage doesn't work for heterosexuals, why should it work for gay people? The only thing we'd gain from institutionalising gay marriage is a lot of of painful and messy divorce. Which is not to say that I don't think long-term gay relationships are a good idea for those who want them - I've been in one myself for 20 years. But even if the government deigned to legalise some kind of same-sex marriage, we wouldn't take it up.</p> <p>You say people should have the choice to marry. The problem with choice is that a lot of gay people won't have one. Many simply don't have a partner. You might say the same thing applies to heterosexuals, but special circumstances apply to gay people. There are fewer of us to go round and the odds against finding the ideal - or even a tolerable - mate are much higher than for straights.</p> <p>By legalising marriage for those lucky enough to have found Mr or Ms Right, we are in danger of creating a two-tier gay community, with the \"married\" couples being supported and accepted while the remainder are left as outsiders, enjoying none of the privileges that legal recognition would bring to the attached.</p> <p>Gay culture (and I'm not talking about the commercial exploitation that passes for entertainment on Old Compton St or Canal St) is unique. It is something that we should treasure. If we start playing by straight rules, our heritage, our colourful history and all that we share as a community will disappear into the heterosexual void. I'm all for breaking down barriers, and making progress, but there comes a moment when we must value our special place in the world. Simply giving ourselves up to become ersatz heterosexuals, when we have so much of value to contribute on our own terms, would be a shame. </p> <p>Best wishes, <br> Terry</p> <p><b>Dear Terry,</b><br> Gay culture is undoubtedly special, and certainly worth preserving. But as you point out in your reference to its tackier elements in the commercial scenes of London and Manchester, it is an illusion to think there is a single gay culture. There are suburban couples, gym queens, lipstick lesbians, leather-clad motorbikers, clubgoers, the works. </p> <p>Making it easier for people to settle down would not threaten the vibrancy of gay life; it would enrich it, particularly for those gay people who are uncomfortable with the more superficial bar scene. As for the have-nots, who will never find Mr or Ms Right, I have little fear. Marriage - as you point out - is unlikely to become as universal a habit among same-sex couples as it is for straight ones, so the singles will not be left stranded.</p> <p>Finally, you argue that we might end up with a two-tier gay community, with the non-marrieds \"enjoying none of the privileges\" of married couples. That's not how I see it. Gay couples should not get legal privileges. But they should not be deprived of the rights of serious relationships in immigration, joint tenancy, inheritance, hospital visiting, etc.</p> <p>Some kind of legal marriage arrangement is perhaps best seen as a passport to a cluster of those \"couples' rights\". It would remove most of the last nonsensical legal deprivations which gay people have had to endure. You can't be against that. </p> <p>All the very best, <br> Evan</p> <p><b>Dear Evan,</b><br> I think our only real difference is in the use of the term \"marriage\". To me it comes heavily burdened with the kind of baggage that gay people should be glad they aren't required to shoulder.</p> <p>I favour the French version, introduced a couple of years ago. There, any couple who live in a mutually supportive relationship can register their partnership at the local mairie. They could be a gay couple, an unmarried straight couple or even two elderly sisters. Those registering qualify for the fiscal advantages enjoyed by married couples. Nobody needs be excluded, and even those gay people who live together as dear friends, but not lovers, can benefit.</p> <p>If gay couples want a \"big day\" type of ceremony at which they show their intimate circle that they've made a serious commitment, then that's OK with me. I love dressing up, and some of the bridal gowns these days are to die for. The lesbian and gay Christian movement will provide you with a sympathetic vicar or, if you want to leave God out of it (and He certainly wants you to leave Him out of it), the Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association have celebrants who'll see you right.</p> <p>Loving, long-term partnerships that have some kind of recognition - yes. Marriage - definitely no.</p> <p>Love to you and yours, <br> Terry</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.kitsch.freeserve.co.uk/life/info10.htm\" target=\"_new\">UK lesbian &amp; gay weddings</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.OutRage.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">OutRage</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.galha.freeserve.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association</a></p>",

They could be a gay couple, an unmarried straight couple or even two elderly sisters. Those registering qualify for the fiscal advantages enjoyed by married couples. Nobody needs be excluded, and even those gay people who live together as dear friends, but not lovers, can benefit. If gay couples want a \"big day\" type of ceremony at which they show their intimate circle that they've made a serious commitment, then that's OK with me. I love dressing up, and some of the bridal gowns these days are to die for. The lesbian and gay Christian movement will provide you with a sympathetic vicar or, if you want to leave God out of it (and He certainly wants you to leave Him out of it), the Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association have celebrants who'll see you right. Loving, long-term partnerships that have some kind of recognition - yes. Marriage - definitely no.

This intimate connection between life on a small blue planet and creative destruction in the heavens is a fetish of popular cosmology. Twentieth-century science delivered many startling facts about the universe, but the one Joni Mitchell sang about at Woodstock is still a clear favourite with science writers. We are stardust. </p> <p>It is a wondrous truth, in a slack-jawed way. And it is wondrous that some particularly complicated clumps of stardust have been able to figure out where they came from. But these facts are often taken to mean much more than this. The grand sweep of this evolutionary story has been used time and again to dispute the physicist Steven Weinberg's famous conclusion to his account of the very beginnings of the universe in The First Three Minutes: \"The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless.\" </p> <p>Just telling a technical story, though, is a weak response to Weinberg's assertion. It only works if the scientific cosmology can be turned back into a religious one. But, as two books which tell the stardust story in unusual detail demonstrate, the attempt always falls short. However well we understand how the universe came to be, it does not tell us what the point is. </p> <p>John Gribbin's new Stardust and Marcus Chown's The Magic Furnace: The Search for the Origins of Atoms, just out in paperback, cover much the same ground. Both use the tried-and-tested pop-science formula of recounting the formation of the elements and interweaving the story of how their stellar origins were pieced together. This is partly because otherwise the atomic narrative alone is too slender to justify a book. The American Ken Croswell did the job pretty well in a single chapter a few years ago, in The Alchemy of the Heavens. Still, it is one of the better scientific stories of the last century, uniting the physics of the microworld with the history of the cosmos. </p> <p>It brings together the extraordinary understanding astrophysicists now have of what happens inside stars with cosmologists' account of the emergence of matter as the early universe expanded and cooled after the big bang. The primordial fireball generated hydrogen and helium, the lightest and still the most common elements. The longer-burning nuclear furnaces of the stars eventually cooked up the heavier ones, relatively rare but vital for making planets and, ultimately, living things. The rarer explosions of supernovae finally produced the heaviest atoms of all, and scattered the whole elemental cocktail through the far reaches of space. </p> <p>Of the two efforts, Chown's version moves along more briskly, though it takes a while to get going. His tale of atoms extends back to the Greeks, but the interesting part doesn't really begin until we get to Eddington's 20th-century ideas about what happens inside stars. Even then, the confines of a discovery narrative mean that each new scientist we meet is on the verge of cracking the next puzzle. Every chapter ends with a question, and the right researcher - George Gamow, perhaps, or Fred Hoyle - pops up with the right answer in the next one. Occasional qualifications in the light of later theory hint at a messier process than this, but the overall impression is of a linear convergence on the truth. </p> <p>Gribbin gives more of the twists and turns of the science, but also tells the reader too much about who did what, when. Like Chown he is admirably clear on the basics of the science, assuming almost nothing, not even ideas like \"atom\" or \"nucleus\". But Gribbin has now written 30 or 40 books on modern physics and astronomy, and there is a whiff of the production line about this one. Even his enthusiasm for these discoveries, and the ingenuity of the scientists who made them, seems rather routine.</p> <p>So, nowadays, does the final chapter in the story. Stardust blasted into space bombarded the surface of the newborn Earth, bringing heavy atoms combined into complex molecules. It was not so many steps from those to the even more complex chemicals found in living cells. A billion extinct solar furnaces spread the seeds of life throughout the galaxy. </p> <p>Such a benign vision of a hospitable cosmos is very appealing: everyone wants to feel wanted. The science may not reveal the hand of God, but it provides some consolation for those who miss Him. The cosmos may be unimaginably vast and awesomely old, but it is not indifferent. We are surely meant to be here. We have a role in this vast scheme of things. We are the universe becoming conscious of itself. </p> <p>In fact, this rhetoric of re-enchantment has been prominent in popular science for 20 years now. The late Carl Sagan's Cosmos, a book-length riposte to Weinberg, brought it to a high pitch in 1980. For Sagan, the universe displayed a unified evolutionary process, and we were at its peak. Sagan presented science deliberately figured as myth, an effort taken further still by writers such as Brian Swimme and Thomas Berry. In their aptly titled The Universe Story, they retell the cosmic epic in would-be poetic language, even giving the various players names. The supernova that bestowed heavy elements on our corner of the galaxy is dubbed Tiamat, after a creature of middle-eastern myth from whose dismembered body heaven and earth were created. </p> <p>There is none of this kind of thing in the books of Gribbin or Chown. They regard themselves as proper science writers, not myth-makers. The hint of a quasi-religious consolation is still there, but watered down. All Gribbin will say is that \"life and the universe are inextricably intertwined\". Chown assures us that \"we are far more intimately connected to events in the cosmos than anyone dared imagine\". </p> <p>Yet these are very half-hearted invocations of the larger meanings of the story claimed by Sagan or Swimme, and suggest that this stream of popular science may have run its course. Astronomer Royal Martin Rees's short and admirably lucid introduction to modern cosmology in Just Six Numbers helps to show why. The outlines of the familiar elemental story are here too, along with details of another intriguing feature of the universe that has often been interpreted in much the same way. The more we understand about the forces shaping cosmic events, the more they seem selected to suit us. There is no particular reason yet known why gravity, for example, is incredibly weak compared with the forces that affect atoms at very close range. Yet if it were just a little stronger, the universe would be nasty, brutish and short-lived. </p> <p>As Rees relates, there are a whole clutch of other numbers of cosmic significance that are measured rather than derived from some theory. Yet to have a cosmos that is long-lasting and can build complex structures like galaxies, planetary systems and people turns out to require just the right numbers - whether we are looking at the amount of stuff it contains, the force that holds atomic nuclei together or the smoothness of the early universe. </p> <p>Using his crucial numbers, Rees builds up a compelling picture of our current understanding of the huge and ancient universe in which we dwell. He has two clear messages. Physics and cosmology are now joined in an arc of knowledge in which theories of the most fundamental particles feed directly into accounts of the development of the whole universe.

The euro clawed back above 90 cents from its lifetime low of 88.37 late on Thursday after new figures showed that US manufacturers cut output for the first time in 19 months in August, while the number of people in work fell by 105,000, taking the unemployment rate from 4% to 4.1%.

      "bodyText": "Ignoring protests from Jews and liberal Roman Catholics, the Pope will beatify one of his predecessors, Pius IX, today, despite the fact that he is accused of anti-semitism, kidnapping and persecution. Putting Pius IX on the road to sainthood will reopen old wounds and put an unbearable strain on Jewish-Catholic relations, the Pope's critics have warned. The last pope-king, who reigned from 1846 to 1878, Pius IX was notorious for herding Rome's Jews into a ghetto, forcibly baptising their children, and limiting their education and employment rights. At his funeral Italian liberals tried to throw his body into the Tiber. Ultra-conservatives in the Vatican are believed to have championed his nomination to counter the simultaneous beatification of John XXIII, who ushered in the liberalisation of the Roman church with the second Vatican council in 1962. Under the headline \"A beatification too far\", the British Catholic weekly the Tablet said it was a political attempt to provide a conservative and reactionary counterweight. Liberals complained that a pontiff who executed criminals and attacked human rights was being held up as a role model. Pius IX issued the Syllabus of Errors - 80 points denouncing the separation of church and state, progress, and modern civilisation - and promulgated the dogmas of papal infallibility and the Virgin Mary's immaculate conception. Most of the 200,000 people expected in St Peter's Square will be honouring John XXIII, revered in Italy as the \"good pope\" who breathed fresh air into the church. Scholars are uncertain how John Paul II will combine tributes to predecessors said to be popes apart. Traditionalists praised the noble-born Pius IX for his courage in defending the church from the tumult of revolutionary Europe, which effectively made him a prisoner in the Vatican. He should not be judged by standards outside his time, they argued. Jewish groups will hold a candle-light demonstration in Rome tonight, but they are not expected to try to disrupt tomorrow's ceremony. Pius IX is notorious for snatching the six-year-old Jewish boy Edgardo Mortara from his family in Bologna in 1858, four years after he was baptised by a maid who feared for his soul. The case became a cause celebre, but appeals by world leaders failed to move Pius, who raised Edgardo as his own son. He became a priest and died in 1940, allegedly mentally scarred. Elena Mortara, Edgardo's great-great niece, said Pius had caused profound suffering in her family and community by actions regarded as shocking even in his own time. Elan Steinberg of the World Jewish Congress questioned why John Paul, who has devoted much of his 22-year pontificate to reaching out to Jews, should now choose to undermine reconciliation. \"We have a paradox here,\" she said. Seymour Reich, chairman of the International Jewish Committee for Interreligious Consultations, said: \"Today, after almost a century and a half, the Italian Jewish community remains embittered by that assault on Judaism and parenthood. \"If saintliness is seen as the goodness, wisdom and courage to behave righteously and right wrongs regardless of when they occur, then Pius IX's conduct falls far short of saintliness.\" A proposal to beatify Pius IX in 1985 was shelved after two senior cardinals and official biographers suggested that he was unsuitable. But in the Italian media, criticism of his beatification has been swamped by enthusiasm for the rapid beatification of the peasant-born John XXIII. Ribbons and balloons festoon his home town, Bergamo. Insiders said the Vatican wanted to twin his beatification with the wartime Pius XII, but the plan was abandoned after renewed controversy over his failure to speak out against the Holocaust. According to one diplomat, Israel has not intervened in the case of Pius IX because it suspects that there will be another attempt to beatify Pius XII and wants to keep its powder dry. John Paul II's eagerness to supply Catholic role models has produced what critics call a \"saint factory\". Since his election in 1978 he has beatified and canonised more than 1,200 candidates: more than all his 20th century predecessors combined.",

One day it was a building site on a rather undistinguished stretch of the rather undistinguished High Holborn, the next there it was, open and ready for business. This quiet modesty extends to the outside of the restaurant. So well-behaved is it, you could easily miss it. But the modesty stops at the front door. </p> <p>The inside is a riot of colour and designery statement, with banquette seats in British racing green racked up the walls like inner tubes piled on top of one another, with lights like huge inflamed gonads dangling from the ceiling, and with wall colourings that follow the new fashionable theory of opposing colours, or clash, as we used to call it. If all that sounds unpleasant, it isn't. Baffling, perhaps, but fun.</p> <p> The stern elegance and impeccable cleanliness of the lavatories is deeply reassuring. The service, too, is very good: bespoke-tailored, smiling, efficient and charming. </p> <p>Before I arranged to meet Pantagruel there, I had already registered that the chef is David Cavalier, a talented cook whom life has not treated as kindly as it might. Consequently, it is some time since the wider public have been able to enjoy his food. Now we can - and, I must say, it has been worth queuing up for. </p> <p>I had, in fact, already eaten in High Holborn the week before - the week it opened, in fact - which is not my usual practice. On that occasion, I had a salad of pigs' trotters and new potatoes with sauce gribiche and then smoked fillet of whiting (or \"merlan\", as the menu insists on calling it) with bubble and squeak, poached egg and hollandaise sauce, followed by a carpaccio of pineapple with coconut sorbet. On that occasion, my companion, Clothilde, made short work of asparagus with a poached egg and a truffle dressing, and then of fillet of lamb with courgettes, asparagus and broad beans, ending with a lemongrass and raspberry cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e on the reasonable grounds that cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e and raspberries are two of her favourite foods in the whole world. </p> <p>So, by the time that Pantagruel and I had put to the sword duck rillette, watercress and mustard salad and a fish soup with rouille, grated cheese and crotons; roast mackerel with spiced chickpeas and best end of lamb with aubergine and courgette tian; and peach Melba and the carpaccio of pineapple again - all off a generous and splendid menu du jour - I had a pretty good feel for Cavalier's way with ingredients. First off, the menu descriptions are as brief and to the point as the dishes are elegant and sophisticated. The rillettes were as advertised, but glazed with a splash of light b\u00e9arnaise and layered between two tiny poppadoms spotted with mustard seeds. Well, blow me, this isn't the hunky, hefty stuff you get from your local traiteur; it's light, delicate, yet knee-tremblingly rich. The salad alongside was a thoughtful mixture of leaves, with a sweetish dressing that insinuated itself to the duck with ingratiating charm. </p> <p>The pigs' trotter salad that I'd had a few days earlier was a similarly refined treatment of a hefty classic, which lost nothing and gained much in translation. The poached trotter had been boned out, formed into a round sausage held in its own jelly, sliced and laid on top of the potatoes with a rich and pungent sauce splattered around. So you got a bit of mild meat in a mild jelly, the firm and earthy potatoes all lubricated with a sauce that combined unctuousness and acid in equal parts. </p> <p>Combining a highly characterised, not to say oily, fish with chickpeas spiced with chilli; the deft cooking of the lamb; the adroit seasoning of all dishes; the way in which vegetables were built into the totality of the dishes; the nifty reworking of classic combinations; and, above all, the unfaultable technique, which meant that each element of each dish was made as it should be (the fish soup was an exemplar for others to follow, if they can)... I mean, when was the last time you had a serious peach Melba, or even hollandaise? </p> <p>This care and consideration reached right through to the puddings. The carpaccio of pineapple was an exceptionally satisfying and clever variation on a well-worn theme, the texture and tartness of the fruit lending itself brilliantly to the treatment (and something you could do at home if you have a slicing machine). None of this is revolutionary stuff. It fits easily within the canon of French cooking. It is French in its technique and tastes. Such intelligence and technical mastery are quite exhilarating in the midst of so many examples of extravagant, ill-assorted experimentation. </p> <p>Lunch with Pantagruel came to \u00a375.50. The eating bit took up \u00a346 - that is, two set-price lunches at \u00a323 for three courses - and \u00a320 went on an outstanding bottle of Corbi\u00e8res (the wine list is building up a strong contingent of decently priced regional French wines in the hands of the disarming sommelier, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Brugues). The usual bits and pieces accounted for the rest. </p> <p>If, as claimed by Anthony Bourdin recently, you can judge a restaurant by its loos, High Holborn should do very well. On balance, though, I think Cavalier's cooking will have a bigger part to play in its success</p>",

      "body": "<p>Self-sown plants are a joy in our own gardens (you rarely meet them in public), but it has to be understood that, when any plant makes itself comfortable, you have to watch it. And watching it probably means eliminating 99 out of 100 seedlings. </p> <p>Think, for instance, how messy self-sown fennel is at this time of year. And it is a tough-rooted plant; an effort to dig out once it has a hold. It's the same with Alchemilla mollis: charming when its young leaves unfold in spring and its lime-green flowers first appear, it will sow itself into all sorts of unexpected places, such as under a bench. But its aim is to take over completely, and it often succeeds. By August, it looks disgusting, its flowerheads brown and trodden on. Again, it is tough to extract. </p> <p>My own garden is full of the wild teazel, which has been flowering these past few weeks, but quickly turns brown. Great presence though its structure has, too many skeletons in the garden become depressing. We shall extract a good many of them, but the rest will be welcome in winter, when dead heads are an asset. They will be visited by goldfinches and, given the weather, comically capped by snow. Meantime, the deep green rosettes of next year's crop are already in place, and need thinning (99 hundredths of them). Some look good at a border's margin, and they like it there, where they find minimal competition. I'll leave some of those; tall though they grow (a good 2m), their open structure does not block the view. </p> <p>Eryngium giganteum, widely known as 'Miss Willmot's Ghost', was at its best in July, with stiff, silvery bracts forming a ruff around the dome of its sea-greeny-blue florets. In August, it declines to a raddled parchment shade, and needs removing. If the ground is soft, after a storm, say, you can pull the tap root out. Otherwise, take the line of least resistance and cut as low as you can, leaving the root to rot. Next year's seedlings are there, though not always placing themselves where you would most like to see them. Thin them rigorously; if overcrowded, they may not flower at all or, if they do, as rather miserable specimens.</p> <p>One of my great stand-bys is Lychnis coronaria - that of the magenta moon-flowers supported by grey-felted stems and leaves. Plants will generally last in good health for a couple of flowerings, but are then greatly weakened. You can easily see which of them should be removed at this stage. Those that you save can be cut back so as to leave their basal, leafy rosettes only. This lychnis will present you with some amazing colour combinations. Before you dub them outrageous and insupportable clashes, just stop and think. Perhaps that clash is rather exciting, where it is occurring, after all. In front of a scarlet crocosmia such as 'Lucifer', say, or with the yellow of Coreopsis verticillata. This, although a strong yellow, contains just a hint of green, which makes all the difference. </p> <p>I have a lot of giant oenothera, the one named O. glaziouana (2m). An evening primrose whose new crop of flowers opens quite late in the evening, they are often generous next morning, remaining in good condition for several hours, especially if the weather is dull. With me, this displays itself to perfection by placing itself at various levels: in the floor of the sunken garden, in the retaining wall around it and in the borders above. So it presents, from the other side of the sunken garden, a curtain of yellow goblets. I could hardly have organised that. But they are running to seed now, and are frighteningly prolific, so I must watch out. </p> <p>A quieter, yet stylish self-sower is the hardy perennial papyrus, Cyperus eragrostis (C. vegetus). Above naked stems (0.7m), it splays out into a green rosette of bracts and a cushion of green flowers. Not showy, this has considerable presence, though it can look weedy if self-sown in quantity. A specimen that Fergus particularly liked put itself near to the fringe of a huge, carpeting Juniperus sabina 'Tamariscifolia'. I think the cyperus is succumbing to engulfment, but it is good in shallow water, too, and I like a few in paving cracks. </p> <p>Many euphorbias self-sow. With the biennial Euphorbia stricta (0.4m), you depend on it to do so. </p> <p>It makes an airy, lime-green inflorescence and, if the situation is a bit hungry, as in a paving crack, the plant stems and pedicels will be attractively red. When E. characias self-sows, you are liable to get a whole lot of rubbish, with unnecessarily dull green inflorescences, whereas good strains of the subspecies wulfenii are bright lime green, verging on yellow. One of the more exciting self-sowers is the shrubby E. mellifera. It has large, evergreen rosettes of important-looking foliage. When this flowers (the blooms smell strongly of honey), the resulting seeds, on ripening, are ejected to a distance of several metres, so self-sowns may astonish you by their positioning. This species is not entirely hardy, but may reach a height of two or three metres. But I think young, unflowered plants are the most handsome</p>",

An evening primrose whose new crop of flowers opens quite late in the evening, they are often generous next morning, remaining in good condition for several hours, especially if the weather is dull. With me, this displays itself to perfection by placing itself at various levels: in the floor of the sunken garden, in the retaining wall around it and in the borders above. So it presents, from the other side of the sunken garden, a curtain of yellow goblets. I could hardly have organised that. But they are running to seed now, and are frighteningly prolific, so I must watch out. A quieter, yet stylish self-sower is the hardy perennial papyrus, Cyperus eragrostis (C. vegetus). Above naked stems (0.7m), it splays out into a green rosette of bracts and a cushion of green flowers. Not showy, this has considerable presence, though it can look weedy if self-sown in quantity. A specimen that Fergus particularly liked put itself near to the fringe of a huge, carpeting Juniperus sabina 'Tamariscifolia'. I think the cyperus is succumbing to engulfment, but it is good in shallow water, too, and I like a few in paving cracks. Many euphorbias self-sow. With the biennial Euphorbia stricta (0.4m), you depend on it to do so. It makes an airy, lime-green inflorescence and, if the situation is a bit hungry, as in a paving crack, the plant stems and pedicels will be attractively red. When E. characias self-sows, you are liable to get a whole lot of rubbish, with unnecessarily dull green inflorescences, whereas good strains of the subspecies wulfenii are bright lime green, verging on yellow. One of the more exciting self-sowers is the shrubby E. mellifera. It has large, evergreen rosettes of important-looking foliage. When this flowers (the blooms smell strongly of honey), the resulting seeds, on ripening, are ejected to a distance of several metres, so self-sowns may astonish you by their positioning. This species is not entirely hardy, but may reach a height of two or three metres. But I think young, unflowered plants are the most handsome",

Holger Nielsen, leader of the Socialist People's party, yesterday told the Guardian he welcomed the DPP's change of tack but questioned its motives. \"If they had been very active it could have been a problem,\" he said. \"My own opinion is that they will save the money they would have spent on an ad campaign and spend it on refugee questions. That's the real reason.\" An opinion poll yesterday gave the Yes camp a 4% lead over the No camp, but the vote is still too close to call, even though the Danish government, most political parties, the media and big business have backed a Yes vote.",

A leaked classified document concludes that the RAF has no alternative to what it calls a \"radical fleet option\" - abandoning or reducing the number of F3 Tornadoes, the RAF's main air defence fighter, the Jaguar fighter-bomber, or the Royal Navy's Sea Harrier. The document recommended \u00a31.5bn cuts in RAF spending over the next 10 years. Such is the scale of budgetary pressures facing the Ministry of Defence that it is contemplating cutting the number of Eurofighters ordered by the RAF - a move that would be hugely embarrassing politically. It also considered the possibility of abandoning plans to build two new aircraft carriers. The document, marked \"Confidential - UK eyes only\", was written by a senior RAF officer for the attention of Vice Admiral Jeremy Blackham, a deputy chief of defence staff. It was leaked to the BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Lewis Moonie, the junior defence minister, insisted yesterday that the document, dated July 14, was \"purely speculative\" and drafted from a set of assumptions which had now been discarded. He suggested that a 0.1 % real increase in the \u00a323bn defence budget, announced on July 17, made the document irrelevant. However, it is known that the proposals were discussed by a standing committee of RAF officers on August 2, after the budget increase was announced.

These commitments include the plan to build two aircraft carriers due to enter service in 2012 and 2015 at a combined cost of \u00a32bn, and the multinational Eurofighter project. Along with the Trident nuclear missile system, the Eurofighter was protected from scrutiny by the 1998 strategic defence review.

However, the navy prefers the potentially cheaper option of buying a US joint strike aircraft now being developed. The document said financial penalties for reducing the order for Eurofighters would mean that a cut would bring no savings. Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats' defence spokesman, said yesterday the report would send a \"shiver of dismay\" through the armed forces. \"This seems to be a return to the haphazard management of the defence budget which characterised the last 10 years of the previous government,\" he said. \"The amount of increase in the defence budget... is really very modest - by no means equivalent to the \u00a31.5bn,\" he added. He described the government's response to the leak as \"unconvincing and disingenuous\". Mr Campbell added: \"The strategic defence review was designed to bring an end to the mismatch between the budget and commitments, but this report suggests that there may be still a substantial gap.\" The Conservative defence spokesman, Quentin Davies, accused the government of gambling with Britain's defence capabilities.

But let's face it, going to work is about doing a task and getting paid for it - so does it really matter whether you get on with your workmates or not? Yes, according to most employers, which is why, sooner or later, your boss will be packing you off on a team building course. </p> <p>Team building has become very fashionable in recent years. It usually involves spending a day or two out of the office in a different part of the country. While there, you and your colleagues will take part in group activities which will supposedly encourage you to bond and be more productive back in the office. Assault courses were popular for a time but these days, you're more likely to find yourself skydiving, walking over hot coals or taking part in an acting workshop.</p> <p>Only trouble is, it doesn't necessarily work, says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. \"It's a good way of getting people away from the pressures of work. But just because you send your employees off to crew a yacht together for a week, it doesn't mean they'll get on,\" he points out.</p> <p>\"In fact, it could have the opposite effect. These activities only encourage team building if people are able to discuss their experiences afterwards and look at why they behaved the way they did. Unfortunately, very few employers do this.\"</p> <p>Engineer Anne Whittaker, who works for a telecommunications firm, agrees. \"I've been on so many of these things now that I'm getting fed up with them,\" she says. \"I sometimes wonder whether it's a cop-out for the company. It's all very well sending people off on courses in the hope that they'll come back to the office and sort out their problems, but if they don't ask for feedback, what's the point?\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, Whittaker feels she has learned from her experiences. \"I don't know whether it's made much difference to how we all get on in my department because we all lead quite separate lives,\" she says. \"But it's good to see your workmates in different roles. The bosses get to see that the secretaries are capable of other things, too. On one course, we had to get into teams and build a mobile,\" she continues. \"One of my team-mates ran out of the room crying. It turned out she couldn't handle the way this bloke and I were speaking to each other. She thought we were too forceful. I was quite shocked because I thought we were just having a discussion but it made me more aware of the effect you can have on other people without realising it.\"</p> <p>Wacky activities are about more than just improving staff relations, says Professor Cooper. \"Some companies want to be 'with it' so they send employees on the most exotic courses they can think of,\" he comments. \"It's a form of corporate competition. It's also a way of rewarding staff without paying tax.\"</p> <p>Joanna Skilton is a PA with a large financial firm in the City. She thoroughly enjoyed the day she and 300 colleagues spent at a samba drumming workshop. \"We were each given an instrument to play and taught to play samba rhythms in small groups,\" she says. \"At the end, all 300 of us played together, which was great. It made me feel more confident because I could see how we achieved a lot together in a short space of time. We were still taking about it months later.\"</p> <p>So next time you find yourself dancing naked round a camp-fire or learning the trombone in the name of team building, take the opportunity to get to know what your colleagues are really like, Professor Cooper advises. Otherwise, just enjoy it. After all, the company's paying.</p>",

It usually involves spending a day or two out of the office in a different part of the country. While there, you and your colleagues will take part in group activities which will supposedly encourage you to bond and be more productive back in the office. Assault courses were popular for a time but these days, you're more likely to find yourself skydiving, walking over hot coals or taking part in an acting workshop. Only trouble is, it doesn't necessarily work, says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. \"It's a good way of getting people away from the pressures of work. But just because you send your employees off to crew a yacht together for a week, it doesn't mean they'll get on,\" he points out. \"In fact, it could have the opposite effect. These activities only encourage team building if people are able to discuss their experiences afterwards and look at why they behaved the way they did. Unfortunately, very few employers do this.\" Engineer Anne Whittaker, who works for a telecommunications firm, agrees. \"I've been on so many of these things now that I'm getting fed up with them,\" she says. \"I sometimes wonder whether it's a cop-out for the company. It's all very well sending people off on courses in the hope that they'll come back to the office and sort out their problems, but if they don't ask for feedback, what's the point?\" Nevertheless, Whittaker feels she has learned from her experiences. \"I don't know whether it's made much difference to how we all get on in my department because we all lead quite separate lives,\" she says. \"But it's good to see your workmates in different roles. The bosses get to see that the secretaries are capable of other things, too. On one course, we had to get into teams and build a mobile,\" she continues. \"One of my team-mates ran out of the room crying. It turned out she couldn't handle the way this bloke and I were speaking to each other. She thought we were too forceful. I was quite shocked because I thought we were just having a discussion but it made me more aware of the effect you can have on other people without realising it.\" Wacky activities are about more than just improving staff relations, says Professor Cooper. \"Some companies want to be 'with it' so they send employees on the most exotic courses they can think of,\" he comments. \"It's a form of corporate competition. It's also a way of rewarding staff without paying tax.\" Joanna Skilton is a PA with a large financial firm in the City. She thoroughly enjoyed the day she and 300 colleagues spent at a samba drumming workshop. \"We were each given an instrument to play and taught to play samba rhythms in small groups,\" she says. \"At the end, all 300 of us played together, which was great. It made me feel more confident because I could see how we achieved a lot together in a short space of time. We were still taking about it months later.\" So next time you find yourself dancing naked round a camp-fire or learning the trombone in the name of team building, take the opportunity to get to know what your colleagues are really like, Professor Cooper advises. Otherwise, just enjoy it. After all, the company's paying.",

      "body": "<p>For a losing England coach who is adamant he will not fall on his sword, Kevin Keegan appears to be cutting it rather fine in his choice of team for tonight's match against France. </p> <p>Needing to restore credibility to the national side and his handling of it following the failures of Euro 2000, as well as laying the foundations for the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, Keegan's team to face the world and European champions in the Stade de France is daring or daft depending on one's point of view. </p> <p>More probably it is a bit of both. In some respects Keegan, overtaken by caution in the European Championship, has rediscovered his old bravura. Now that Alan Shearer has retired from international football, Keegan has abandoned the idea of playing with two out-and-out strikers. Andy Cole will lead the attack with Paul Scholes, a Manchester United team-mate, playing off him rather than alongside him. </p> <p>In addition David Beckham will operate in a central role with Darren Anderton returning on the right wing. Shearer required automatic service from the flanks but since he is no longer an option Keegan and his attackers should enjoy greater freedom as they seek a combination to penetrate the defences of Germany and Finland in the World Cup just over a month from now. </p> <p>For the moment Michael Owen has lost his place as a first-choice striker although the Liverpool player may well reappear at some point tonight. Keegan clearly wants to see if the rounding out of Cole's game at Old Trafford can be reproduced at international level. Another flop, however, and Cole's best chance of an England career will surely have disappeared forever. </p> <p>Clearly Beckham's revised role is the key. \"This is a great opportunity for David Beckham to show that he can run the game from that position,\" Keegan explained. \"I know it's a role he can play. Sometimes he has tended to be a bit isolated on the right wing.\" </p> <p>With Anderton and Nick Barmby giving them natural width England should not be short of the means to disturb a French back four which has yet to play on a losing side and will be keen to keep this record intact as Laurent Blanc, like Didier Deschamps, plays in his last international. The Manchester United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, however, will not play owing to an ankle injury. </p> <p>England's own defence will be a back four without full-backs thinly protected by a non-tackling midfield. Had he been fit, the 20-year-old Steven Gerrard would have been the anchor man. Instead it will be the 33-year-old Dennis Wise, an occasional nicker of the ball for Chelsea but out of his depth in this sort of company. </p> <p>Wise is there, rather than Paul Ince, because Keegan feels he needs someone who can play the ball accurately from deep positions, as Wise certainly did during the scoreless friendly against Argentina at Wembley in February. </p> <p>Keegan is conscious of the need for England to play the ball more constructively from the back than they did in Euro 2000, when they tended to whack it upfield vaguely in Shearer's direction, a habit which ensured it returned at even greater speed. This is why the 19-year-old Gareth Barry has been chosen on the left side of defence. \"He's a good user of the ball who doesn't get flustered,\" said Keegan, \"and you do tend to get a little more time at international level.\" </p> <p>That said, Barry is one of a back three at Villa Park with limited experience of full-back play. Similarly Sol Campbell will play at right-back purely on the evidence of a competent game in that position when England won the opening leg of their European Championship play-off against Scotland at Hampden Park. </p> <p>True, Campbell readjusted his game on that occasion but if Thierry Henry takes him on as he did a tiring Fabio Cannavaro when France beat Italy in the Euro 2000 final the Tottenham defender's limitations as a right-back will surely be exposed. </p> <p>Phil Neville, whose foul on Viorel Moldovan in the last minute gave Romania the penalty from which they sent England packing from Euro 2000, is a more natural right-back and may yet come off the bench tonight, if only to preserve his distinction of being the only player to appear in every one of Keegan's teams. </p> <p>Maybe Keegan is being cute.

      "bodyText": "For a losing England coach who is adamant he will not fall on his sword, Kevin Keegan appears to be cutting it rather fine in his choice of team for tonight's match against France. Needing to restore credibility to the national side and his handling of it following the failures of Euro 2000, as well as laying the foundations for the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, Keegan's team to face the world and European champions in the Stade de France is daring or daft depending on one's point of view. More probably it is a bit of both. In some respects Keegan, overtaken by caution in the European Championship, has rediscovered his old bravura. Now that Alan Shearer has retired from international football, Keegan has abandoned the idea of playing with two out-and-out strikers. Andy Cole will lead the attack with Paul Scholes, a Manchester United team-mate, playing off him rather than alongside him. In addition David Beckham will operate in a central role with Darren Anderton returning on the right wing. Shearer required automatic service from the flanks but since he is no longer an option Keegan and his attackers should enjoy greater freedom as they seek a combination to penetrate the defences of Germany and Finland in the World Cup just over a month from now. For the moment Michael Owen has lost his place as a first-choice striker although the Liverpool player may well reappear at some point tonight. Keegan clearly wants to see if the rounding out of Cole's game at Old Trafford can be reproduced at international level. Another flop, however, and Cole's best chance of an England career will surely have disappeared forever. Clearly Beckham's revised role is the key. \"This is a great opportunity for David Beckham to show that he can run the game from that position,\" Keegan explained. \"I know it's a role he can play. Sometimes he has tended to be a bit isolated on the right wing.\" With Anderton and Nick Barmby giving them natural width England should not be short of the means to disturb a French back four which has yet to play on a losing side and will be keen to keep this record intact as Laurent Blanc, like Didier Deschamps, plays in his last international. The Manchester United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, however, will not play owing to an ankle injury. England's own defence will be a back four without full-backs thinly protected by a non-tackling midfield. Had he been fit, the 20-year-old Steven Gerrard would have been the anchor man. Instead it will be the 33-year-old Dennis Wise, an occasional nicker of the ball for Chelsea but out of his depth in this sort of company. Wise is there, rather than Paul Ince, because Keegan feels he needs someone who can play the ball accurately from deep positions, as Wise certainly did during the scoreless friendly against Argentina at Wembley in February. Keegan is conscious of the need for England to play the ball more constructively from the back than they did in Euro 2000, when they tended to whack it upfield vaguely in Shearer's direction, a habit which ensured it returned at even greater speed. This is why the 19-year-old Gareth Barry has been chosen on the left side of defence. \"He's a good user of the ball who doesn't get flustered,\" said Keegan, \"and you do tend to get a little more time at international level.\" That said, Barry is one of a back three at Villa Park with limited experience of full-back play. Similarly Sol Campbell will play at right-back purely on the evidence of a competent game in that position when England won the opening leg of their European Championship play-off against Scotland at Hampden Park. True, Campbell readjusted his game on that occasion but if Thierry Henry takes him on as he did a tiring Fabio Cannavaro when France beat Italy in the Euro 2000 final the Tottenham defender's limitations as a right-back will surely be exposed. Phil Neville, whose foul on Viorel Moldovan in the last minute gave Romania the penalty from which they sent England packing from Euro 2000, is a more natural right-back and may yet come off the bench tonight, if only to preserve his distinction of being the only player to appear in every one of Keegan's teams. Maybe Keegan is being cute. Few expect England to beat France tonight and many will be pleasantly surprised if they avoid defeat. So why not gamble a little and try something different? Better that, Keegan might argue, than try to revive a busted flush through a cursory shuffle of the pack. He has been in the job for just over a year of a three-year, \u00a33m contract. Fourteen months ago the Football Association and the nation begged him to take over the moribund squad left by the sudden departure of Glenn Hoddle. Now the punters are placing bets on when Keegan will go and the identity of his successor, while a bad result and performance tonight will hasten the moment when at least one member of the FA international committee publicly expresses his doubts about the way England are being run. That the international committee rarely agrees on anything unanimously except lunch would be of scant consolation for Keegan, who has never pretended to be a miracle worker but was expected to work them all the same. Should England win tonight even the agnostics may be converted.",

But while he was no doubt prepared for censure from the opposition benches, he probably did not expect a regular slating from a good deal closer to home, his father-in-law. In the latest episode of the prime ministerial family washing their its dirty laundry in public, Mr Blair was again yesterday forced to slap down criticism of his government from Tony Booth. Like rather a lot of British pensioners, Mr Boothis none too happy with the government's refusal to restore the link between earnings and the state pension. He doesn't, however, blame his son-in-law directly for the last government-approved increase, which saw a single person's payment rise by just 75p rise in a single person's pension. Mr Booth blames chancellor Gordon Brown and wants Mr Blair to loosen the iron chancellor's purse strings. \"The prime minister is the first secretary of the Treasury,\" said Mr Booth. (Mr Blair is first lord).\"He has the authority to intervene and correct the mistakes and miscalculations of this chancellor and he should do so.\" So incensed is Mr Booth at what he sees as the government's miserliness, that he is lending his support to the National Pensioners' Convention, a group which campaigns for the restoration of the earnings link so poorer pensioners do not have to rely on means-tested benefit. In pursuit of the campaign, Mr Booth yesterday appeared on Radio 4's Today programme. He said: \"The government can afford it because we know that the national insurance fund has a surplus of over \u00a35bn and by 2002 this will be doubled to almost \u00a310.5bn.\" The prime minister, in Scotland chairing a meeting of the joint ministerial committee before spending a weekend with the royal family at Balmoral, was philosophical.

The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), which monitors football hooliganism, said last night that the number prevented from attending the match is likely to increase as police forces around the country step up security at rail and ferry terminals to prevent troublemakers leaving the country. The Football Disorder Act, which came into effect on Monday, gives police the right to prevent even those who have not committed any offence from leaving the country or attending a match if it is felt they may cause trouble at some point. Hooligans can be banned for up to 10 years with orders applying to domestic and international matches. Three banning orders were served earlier this week while another 19 supporters have been served with summonses ordering them to appear before a magistrate for a banning order hearing. They will not be allowed to leave the country until after their appearance. Last Wednesday, Chris Sawford, 21, from Swindon, became the first person to be affected by the new legislation when he was served with a two-year banning order preventing him attending matches at home or abroad. Yesterday Steven Turnball, 28, from Littlehampton, West Sussex, and his twin brother, Christopher, were also served with two-year orders. Under previous legislation only those who had committed a football-related offence could be served with banning orders. Police have the right to detain suspects for six hours before serving them with a notice to appear before a magistrate for a banning order hearing. An NCIS spokeswoman said: \"We expect the number of people prevented from attending the Paris match to increase. The new legislation is exactly what we wanted.

These are the new intake of students at France's Centre Nationale de Formation, the academy for elite footballers which has become the model for all such projects, thanks to the success of its graduates on the biggest of stages. </p> <p>\"The problem is that years ago young players used to play in the streets, the meadows and the open spaces,\" G\u00e9rard Houllier, one of the architects of the Clairefontaine project, told me when he was still the technical director of the French football federation. \"Now, no more. When they see an open space, it's a car park. We've had to try and replace that, somehow.\" France's recent honours have been the measure of their success in translating the game of the streets to the manicured lawns of a country estate. </p> <p>Tables have been turned, old assumptions reversed. Clairefontaine and the philosophy it represents are the reason why it is hardly an exaggeration to say that England will tiptoe into the silver saucer of the Stade de France for tonight's friendly match with the abashed air of impoverished peasants accepting a free meal from their aristocratic neighbours. </p> <p>The analogy is not exact. Ironically, the disparity between tax laws on either side of the Channel means that the cash-rich Premier League has provided French fans with much of their best entertainment over the past month. Suddenly England is full of French footballers. The successful arrival of Fabien Barthez at Manchester United, the successive red cards earned by Patrick Vieira of Arsenal, the simmering row between Frank Leboeuf of Chelsea and his coach, Gianluca Vialli, the arrival of Sylvain Wiltord at Highbury and the brilliant contributions of Thierry Henry and Marcel Desailly to their respective London clubs have made headlines in the French sports pages. </p> <p>Between their two historic triumphs in Paris and Rotterdam, France came to Wembley in February 1999 and, in the crumbling ancestral home that provides such a contrast with their own shining palace of modern sport, gave England a football lesson. Now French players are celebrated across the continent. After the draw for the Champions League group matches last week, L'Equipe proudly noted that, quite apart from those representing Paris St-Germain, Lyon and Monaco, no fewer than 20 French footballers would be involved in the competition, from Lionel Charbonnier at Rangers to Pascal Nouma at Besiktas, from Claude Makelele in Madrid to Bixente Lizarazu in Munich. </p> <p>Ten years ago it was all very different. When France failed to qualify for the World Cup in Italy there was no great sense of surprise. The generation of Michel Platini, Jean Tigana and Alain Giresse - the central figures of the team that won the European Championship of 1984, and reached the semi-finals of the World Cups of 1982 and 1986 - had been a bit of a fluke, and everybody knew it. </p> <p>When their successors failed again, four years later, it was rather more of a shock. Better things had been expected of the team of Jean-Pierre Papin, Eric Cantona and David Ginola, before the last-named misdirected a pass that enabled Bulgaria to snatch a last-minute victory at the Parc des Princes in the final qualifying game. </p> <p>But by the time Ginola made the mistake that ended his international career the French football federation had already laid the foundations for a very different future. A far-reaching scheme for identifying and educating talented young players, created by the team of Houllier, Aim\u00e9 Jacquet and Roger Lemerre, was in place, with results that we have seen over the past two years. France won the World Cup of 1998 on home soil under Jacquet, recaptured the European Championship in Holland this summer under Lemerre and will in all probability travel to the Far East in 2002 as favourites to continue their run of success. Now France is quite simply the worldwide example for the production of young footballers. </p> <p>Such phenomena tend not to last for ever. Not so long ago the English FA was being regularly advised to follow the example of its German counterparts when it came to ensuring a rational succession from one national coach to another. Who, surveying the wreckage of Germany's campaigns in 1998 and 2000, would emulate them now? Yet it is hard to find evidence for the proposition that the French are likely to be resting on their laurels any day now. Behind the Zidanes, the Desaillys and the Thurams are another talented generation - among them the midfielders Peter Luccin of Paris St-Germain and Vikash Dhorasoo and Steed Malbranque of Lyon, the defender Philippe Christanval of Monaco, and the goalkeepers S\u00e9bastien Frey of Internazionale and Mickael Landreau of Nantes. </p> <p>Yet even that generation could be out of luck. Laurent Blanc and Didier De schamps are saying adieu tonight, after winning more than a century of caps apiece, but most of the senior squad will want to stay around and defend their world title in two years' time, which could force some of their putative successors to miss a turn. And coming up behind is another bunch of outstandingly gifted performers, such as Philippe Mexes, Auxerre's composed 18-year-old libero, and Bernard Mendy, PSG's versatile 19-year-old attacker. </p> <p>In the French system continuity is everything - not least continuity of care and supervision, exemplified by the practice of giving each intake of international players a coach of their own, one who stays with them for five years, all the way from the Under-15 to the Under-20 stage. The potential benefit is obvious. </p> <p>And so is the contrast. While France were failing to qualify for Italia 90, and facing their Year Zero, England were reaching the semi-finals, where Bobby Robson's team went out on penalties to the eventual winners. With a line-up including Peter Shilton, Des Walker, Paul Gascoigne, Peter Beardsley and Gary Lineker, they considered themselves unlucky not to have made further progress, and saw no reason not to view the future with optimism. The catastrophe of their failure, under Graham Taylor, to reach USA 94 was eventually obscured by the weird euphoria of Euro 96, in which another semi-final defeat by Germany, this time under Terry Venables, was somehow made to feel like a victory manqu\u00e9, but their performances in France 98 under Glenn Hoddle and at Euro 2000 under Kevin Keegan reasserted the unsettling pattern of expectation and disappointment. </p> <p>Continuity, planning, vision, personal modesty and collective will - all these qualities, so vital to the ascent of the French - have been notable by their absence from England's progress over the last decade. Perhaps, thanks to Howard Wilkinson's friendship with Houllier, the lesson has been learnt, although it is hard to see how an entirely club-based academy system can produce the same results, given the natural selfishness of market-driven commercial enterprises. Tonight's visit to the Stade de France will provide a reminder that Zinedine Zidane's genius certainly wins big matches, but anyone who believes that individual talent alone represents the difference is playing the ball down the wrong channel.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In football the tills are alive to the sound of a new music.

      "body": "<p>Mid-afternoon outside the Amsterdam Hilton and a clutch of pre-pubescent star-spotters are hovering around Breitnerstraat, peering nervously through the majestic revolving doors and daring one another to cross the dividing line between their own world and the pampered domain of the professional footballer. </p> <p>Inside, Robbie Keane is milling around the marbled foyer, signing autographs, posing for photographs. The Republic of Ireland squad have just arrived for tonight's World Cup qualifier against Holland and there is no doubt who is the star attraction. To his wide-eyed audience, the others are but a faceless blur. For all they could care, Roy Keane may as well be the bellboy. </p> <p>After the World Cup, in the midst of Michael Owen hysteria, Niall Quinn told this newspaper there was a wiry young lad at Wolverhampton Wanderers who was better than Liverpool's own golden boy. </p> <p>There were snorts of derision at the time, of course. But, in his quiet way, Keane Jr has lived up to the hype and more besides. Much more. </p> <p>Now, little more than a month since swapping the Sky Blues of Coventry for the blue skies of northern Italy, Internazionale's new \u00a313m forward is already a huge hit. </p> <p>In Milan, replica jerseys emblazoned with his name are outselling those bearing the legend Ronaldo by almost two to one. </p> <p>The fans love him and, for now at least, the notoriously fickle Italian media do, too. In his first competitive match, as a substitute for Ivan Zamorano in the Champions' League qualifier against Helsingborg, the 20-year-old announced his arrival by backheeling a shot against the post and then winning a penalty. It was missed and his team lost on aggregate. </p> <p>\"Why didn't Keane start?\" shrieked Corriere dello Sport. \"Of all Marcello Lippi's initial choices, none was as bad as the decision not to play Keane.\" </p> <p>When Keane arrived in England, a bandy-legged 16-year-old, he was homesick and lonely but not once did he pursue a return to Dublin. It is his unbending demeanour that inspires hope he will prevail where so many others have buckled. </p> <p>His work will be cut out. Inter's forward line is like a Who's Who of defenders' nightmares - from Ivan Zamarano to Christian Vieri, Hakan Sukur to Alvaro Recoba and, injury permitting, Ronaldo. </p> <p>Yet Keane is far from overawed. \"It should bring the best out of me,\" he says. \"I would never have signed if I didn't think I had a chance of playing. </p> <p>\"You will have to ask me in a few months whether I'm a different player or a different person. But I won't be thinking that because I'm at Inter I'm automatically one of the best players in the world.\" </p> <p>When Liam Brady went to Juventus he took an Italian/English dictionary everywhere he went. Keane reveals he, too, has a phrasebook almost permanently wedged in his back pocket. </p> <p>\"I'm doing all right, or at least that's what my teacher tells me she's very nice like that,\" he says. </p> <p>\"People who have been successful in Italy have all learned the language. I made a point of speaking to David Platt and he said it would help me to settle in so much quicker.\" </p> <p>He is being helped by his new room-mate, Clarence Seedorf, who should also be on parade in the Amsterdam Arena this evening because of a rash of injuries that have ruled out almost an entire Dutch team. </p> <p>\"If there is such a thing as a good time to face Holland, this could be it,\" Keane volunteers. Yet, bravado aside, the Irish could not have asked for a much harder opening match. </p> <p>It is a tough group with Portugal to come. If Keane's fame is to continue spreading, it may have to be with club rather than country. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Keane's name-sake, Roy, will be the target of gamesmanship in Amsterdam, according to the Dutch defender Michael Reiziger. The comments, which he subsequently tried to play down, appeared on the Barcelona player's website. </p> <p>\"If we're smart we could get him a red card because he has a dodgy temperament,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We will have to provoke Keane in some way, perhaps holding his shirt or walking into him after he passes the ball. </p> <p>\"Players are also known to whisper comments about another player's mother or the size of his body parts. I don't like that side of the game very much but if it helps us to win then it's worthwhile.\"</p>",

In Milan, replica jerseys emblazoned with his name are outselling those bearing the legend Ronaldo by almost two to one. The fans love him and, for now at least, the notoriously fickle Italian media do, too. In his first competitive match, as a substitute for Ivan Zamorano in the Champions' League qualifier against Helsingborg, the 20-year-old announced his arrival by backheeling a shot against the post and then winning a penalty. It was missed and his team lost on aggregate. \"Why didn't Keane start?\" shrieked Corriere dello Sport. \"Of all Marcello Lippi's initial choices, none was as bad as the decision not to play Keane.\" When Keane arrived in England, a bandy-legged 16-year-old, he was homesick and lonely but not once did he pursue a return to Dublin. It is his unbending demeanour that inspires hope he will prevail where so many others have buckled. His work will be cut out. Inter's forward line is like a Who's Who of defenders' nightmares - from Ivan Zamarano to Christian Vieri, Hakan Sukur to Alvaro Recoba and, injury permitting, Ronaldo. Yet Keane is far from overawed. \"It should bring the best out of me,\" he says. \"I would never have signed if I didn't think I had a chance of playing. \"You will have to ask me in a few months whether I'm a different player or a different person. But I won't be thinking that because I'm at Inter I'm automatically one of the best players in the world.\" When Liam Brady went to Juventus he took an Italian/English dictionary everywhere he went. Keane reveals he, too, has a phrasebook almost permanently wedged in his back pocket. \"I'm doing all right, or at least that's what my teacher tells me she's very nice like that,\" he says. \"People who have been successful in Italy have all learned the language. I made a point of speaking to David Platt and he said it would help me to settle in so much quicker.\" He is being helped by his new room-mate, Clarence Seedorf, who should also be on parade in the Amsterdam Arena this evening because of a rash of injuries that have ruled out almost an entire Dutch team. \"If there is such a thing as a good time to face Holland, this could be it,\" Keane volunteers. Yet, bravado aside, the Irish could not have asked for a much harder opening match. It is a tough group with Portugal to come. If Keane's fame is to continue spreading, it may have to be with club rather than country. Meanwhile, Keane's name-sake, Roy, will be the target of gamesmanship in Amsterdam, according to the Dutch defender Michael Reiziger. The comments, which he subsequently tried to play down, appeared on the Barcelona player's website. \"If we're smart we could get him a red card because he has a dodgy temperament,\" he said. \"We will have to provoke Keane in some way, perhaps holding his shirt or walking into him after he passes the ball. \"Players are also known to whisper comments about another player's mother or the size of his body parts. I don't like that side of the game very much but if it helps us to win then it's worthwhile.\"",

Ho ho ... Good question! ... er ... Next! Mr Mark Pitts of Chiswick asks: \"What's all this sports nourishment about? ... what's wrong with good old-fashioned English grub?\" Well, Mark ... nothing! ... Remember Kevin's announcement on taking the England job? ... \"Sausages are back on the menu!\" ... He nearly got bowled over in the rush! ... Bit like that little misunderstanding over his \"Plenty of talent in the dressing room!\" In my day it was fish and chips! ... washed down with a bottle of dandelion and burdock! ... Alf Tupper? ... hmm? ... marvellous! ... Kept the speed down! ... Allowed the creative players time to flourish ... none of that haring around! It's all those dietary supplements to blame, isn't it? ... That Creatine stuff! Why do players today need performance enhancers? ... hmm? Why do they have to make Viagra so big? ... Whopping great blue pill ... damn difficult to swallow without a couple of tins of that isotonic drink I've been advertising recently on Sky! ... Great stuff!

What did he mean by sexy football? Was you a sexy footballer in your heyday?\" Well Mark, it's not just about poncing around in the wife's underwear is it? ... and oh yes! In my day I was ... I were a sexy footballer! ... Why do you young 'uns always think you invented it all? ... We'd regularly hit the fleshpots after a big game ... and sometimes before! ... Oh yes! Ho ho! ...

Thus far West Indies have come back extremely well. From a situation shortly before tea on the first day when Mike Atherton and Marcus Trescothick had added 159 for the first wicket, they countered, taking all 10 wickets for 122 on a pitch that, while not entirely easy (it has too little substance to it for that) was never nasty. </p> <p>Having been put in, England may have reasoned that 300 would be a competitive score, but after such a start they have most definitely underachieved.

Later, in the final over before the light closed in, Gough produced another inswinger and it must have been the closest of calls as to whether it was just sneaking down the legside. </p> <p>With considerable damage done to their efforts the previous evening there was much work to be done by the England batsmen when play resumed yesterday. With only the briefest interruption for rain inside the first 30 minutes, Thorpe and Hick batted for the best part of an hour-and-a-half in adding a further 34 runs, aided perhaps by Jimmy Adams' decision to withdraw Courtney Walsh from the attack after one over and replace him with Nixon McLean. </p> <p>Hick had reached 17 when Curtly Ambrose constructed the over which dismissed him. First he sent a fielder back on the hook, and then followed with a brace of bouncers. Hick ignored them but they had served their purpose in pushing him back. When Ambrose then pitched well up, the batsman was stranded back in his crease and indisputably lbw. Ambrose, celebrating vigorously, appeared to enjoy the entrapment element as much as anything. </p> <p>With one partner gone, after a sixth-wicket stand of 40, the other was to follow in spectacular fashion in the following over. By now Adams had recalled Walsh and, just as he had at Old Trafford for Thorpe's return to Test cricket, he produced a masterly slower ball - just 67mph compared to his normal 80-odd - that deceived the batsman once more into looking away. The ball struck him around the ankle and he too was lbw. In Manchester, Thorpe could console himself in the knowledge that it was his first ball.
