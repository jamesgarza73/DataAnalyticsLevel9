John Aldridge's gallant side will carry the hopes of Merseyside to Wembley in the Worthington Cup final after contemptuously dismissing the tepid challenge of Bolton Wanderers here last night. The unfashionable Wirral side almost preposterously stand within tantalising reach of a place in Europe and their previous excursions against top flight opposition this season indicate that neither Leicester City nor Aston Villa will induce much fear come February 27. For now, however, they can be forgiven for enjoying the present rather than the future. After all, 114 years is a long time to harbour an inferiority complex in the shadows of Liverpool and Everton.

The 30-year-old Portuguese international is in dispute with the Rome club and wants to move as quickly as possible. United will turn the clock back 24 years on Saturday when for the first time since Tommy Docherty was manager a crowd of more than 60,000 will watch a game at Old Trafford. The attendance for the visit of Middlesbrough will also be the largest for a Premiership match since the competition was launched in 1992. A crowd of 58,293 saw United draw 1-1 with Arsenal on Monday but, as work on the extension of the east stand nears completion, an additional 3,000 seats have been made available. Not since the days of standing on the terraces has Old Trafford catered for such numbers. The last time United broke the 60,000 barrier was for a league game against Everton on April 17 1976 when 61,879 saw a 2-1 win. In 1967-68 United attendances topped 60,000 at nine home league games but with only eight Premiership home fixtures remaining this season that record will remain until next year. By then the capacity will be 68,000.",

A quick look at the Ordnance Survey map would tell them simply that they were passing a \"radio station\". This is in fact Sharpnose Point, an outstation of GCHQ, the government's electronic eavesdropping centre based in Cheltenham.</p> <p>It is conveniently situated to exchange secret intelligence with GCHQ's partner, the US National Security Agency based at Fort Meade in Maryland. According to US sources, it has also been used to intercept civilian American communications via BT's satellite receiving station at Goonhilly Downs about 65 miles further south along the coast.</p> <p>It is mentioned occasionally in books and articles. Yet few people who walk past have any idea what it does. For decades, the Russians spent millions of pounds trying to obtain pictures of places such as Sharpnose Point. Yet from next week it will be possible for anyone to get hold of detailed and high quality aerial photographs of this and any other of Britain's most sensitive installations through the internet.</p> <p>On Monday, the Millennium Map, a photographic record of the whole of Britain from the air, will be launched on a new website, <a href=\"http://www.getmapping.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.getmapping.com</a>. The map, a 21st century version of the Doomsday Book, provides an inventory of every building and piece of land in the country in unprecedented detail. Every outdoor object larger than 10 inches is visible.</p> <p>The site will be undergoing testing next week but soon anyone with a PC will be able to type in a postcode or grid reference and zoom in on an area, from their own back garden, to Buckingham Palace to a military base.</p> <p>The release of the Millennium Map is the latest reminder that the kind of information which governments once controlled tightly, and which the superpowers once invested billions of dollars to obtain covertly, is now as readily available as a street map for a European city.</p> <p>The rules about secrecy, about what we are allowed to see and publish, have been left trailing behind as commercial organisations exploit great leaps in technology. A pillar of \"national security\", and the longstanding system for protecting Britain's most senstive sites, appears to be crumbling before our eyes.</p> <p>The Millennium Map project is the brainchild of Tristram Cary, an ex-Navy navigation systems expert, who until recently was working at the National Remote Sensing Centre, where satellite data is processed for use. Since last spring, he has had four pilots flying up and down the country at 4,500ft with special computer-controlled cameras taking pictures.

      "bodyText": "Walkers who explore the spectacular south-west coast trail a few kilometres north of Bude stumble across an unexpected view: from the path kept open for the public by the National Trust, a forest of satellite dishes and strange mushroom-like structures can be seen rising up from the fields. A quick look at the Ordnance Survey map would tell them simply that they were passing a \"radio station\". This is in fact Sharpnose Point, an outstation of GCHQ, the government's electronic eavesdropping centre based in Cheltenham. It is conveniently situated to exchange secret intelligence with GCHQ's partner, the US National Security Agency based at Fort Meade in Maryland. According to US sources, it has also been used to intercept civilian American communications via BT's satellite receiving station at Goonhilly Downs about 65 miles further south along the coast. It is mentioned occasionally in books and articles. Yet few people who walk past have any idea what it does. For decades, the Russians spent millions of pounds trying to obtain pictures of places such as Sharpnose Point. Yet from next week it will be possible for anyone to get hold of detailed and high quality aerial photographs of this and any other of Britain's most sensitive installations through the internet. On Monday, the Millennium Map, a photographic record of the whole of Britain from the air, will be launched on a new website, www.getmapping.com. The map, a 21st century version of the Doomsday Book, provides an inventory of every building and piece of land in the country in unprecedented detail. Every outdoor object larger than 10 inches is visible. The site will be undergoing testing next week but soon anyone with a PC will be able to type in a postcode or grid reference and zoom in on an area, from their own back garden, to Buckingham Palace to a military base. The release of the Millennium Map is the latest reminder that the kind of information which governments once controlled tightly, and which the superpowers once invested billions of dollars to obtain covertly, is now as readily available as a street map for a European city. The rules about secrecy, about what we are allowed to see and publish, have been left trailing behind as commercial organisations exploit great leaps in technology. A pillar of \"national security\", and the longstanding system for protecting Britain's most senstive sites, appears to be crumbling before our eyes. The Millennium Map project is the brainchild of Tristram Cary, an ex-Navy navigation systems expert, who until recently was working at the National Remote Sensing Centre, where satellite data is processed for use. Since last spring, he has had four pilots flying up and down the country at 4,500ft with special computer-controlled cameras taking pictures. The map represents an investment of some \u00a33m, raised from private shareholders who include its patron, the Queen. \"We've taken pictures of everything. There was no part of the country where we were not allowed to fly,\" Cary says. Pictures in similar detail - at a resolution of one metre (ie, capable of showing clearly objects down to one square metre) - are already available commercially over the internet from an American satellite company, Space Imaging. Its Ikonos satellite, launched last year, passes over the same point of the earth every three days and if you have a credit card you can order photographs of more or less anything for $1,000 or so. \"There are currently no restrictions anywhere in the world.

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Jack Straw, last night attempted to restore his anti-racist credentials by announcing he is not only to extend his race relations bill to combat \"institutional racism\" but will go much further and place a positive legal duty on the whole of the public sector - from the police to schools and hospitals - to promote equality. The decision not to include powers to combat indirect discrimination in Mr Straw's original bill, even though they were recommended last year in the Stephen Lawrence inquiry report, stunned race equality campaigners. The move to add them follows trenchant criticism and the threat of a highly embarrassing revolt in the House of Lords today by nearly all the black and Asian Labour peers appointed by Tony Blair. The changes announced by Mr Straw last night to the race relations (amendment) bill will mean that every aspect of the public sector - from police stop and search powers, to admission policies of schools and the allocation of street market stalls - will come under anti-discrimination laws. The provision on the public sector to promote equality will mean that every part of it, including local authorities, will have to look at its career structures and workforce and account for the lack of black and Asian faces in senior positions. But the new powers will stop short of giving legal cover to \"positive action\" measures such as training only unemployed black people with specific skills. \"This is about making sure that what you do does not continue to disadvantage somebody. It is not about giving a special leg up,\" said a spokesman for the commission for racial equality. The decision to bring the police, prisons and immigration service within the new powers banning indirect discrimination will have far-reaching effects. It means their practices and policies, while not in themselves racist, but having a discriminatory effect on particular racial groups, will be open to court challenge. For example as the original bill was published, individuals could sue the police and claim compensation if they believed they were being repeatedly stopped and search in the street because of their colour. Now, a CRE spokesman explained, the stop and search policy in an entire area of a city could be deemed illegal if it could be proved that it indirectly discriminated against black or Asian people, even if the discrimination was unintentional. Last night Mr Straw said he had decided to extend the bill to cover indirect discrimination in the public sector after very careful consideration. \"The government has always been in favour of this in principle, but had been concerned to ensure that the provisions were effective without leaving public bodies open to routine legal challenge in circumstances where their policies were entirely proper,\" he said. Home office civil servants had warned that such powers in a race relations bill could leave other policies which discriminated in favour of a particular group, such as subsidised bus passes for pensioners or the new deal for the young unemployed, open to legal challenge. Mr Straw conceded that he could live with the possibility of such \"spurious challenges\". The home secretary said the announcement also meant that the race relations act would be extended to institutional racism in areas such as the \"implementation of central and local government's regulatory, economic and social policies and law enforcement\". He said the legal commitment to promote equality would \"send the clearest possible message that discrimination is not acceptable and will not be tolerated\". The home secretary cited the example of his own department's 800-strong network of black and Asian staff, which had been set up to tackle racism and discrimination throughout the home office. It is believed that the new measure, although stopping far short of positive discrimination, does not give legal cover to schemes such as the BBC's training scheme for black and Asian staff to help their accelerated promotion. It will ensure, however, that every part of the public sector will have to follow the example of the army in making particular attempts to recruit and retain minority ethnic staff at every level. Sir Herman Ouseley, the outgoing chairman of the CRE, welcomed the concessions, saying they had emerged as a result of pressure from minority ethnic communities, lawyers, the CRE and black and Asian peers in the Lords. Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, last night welcomed plans to strengthen the bill. He said: \"The current bill, unamended, was the minimum they could do after Lawrence, and was totally unsatisfactory. \"Our colleagues in the Lords had made clear that without the amendment the bill would have been defeated.

They have completed a report into the death of Harold McGowan, 34, also known as Erroll, which will be considered by a coroner's jury on February 28. They are still investigating the death of his nephew, Jason, 20.</p> <p>The police insisted yesterday: \"Extensive inquiries have not yet revealed any evidence to suggest the direct involvement of a third party in either death.\"</p> <p>But the family's solicitor Errol Robinson, said yesterday that a preliminary investigation by Nat Carey from Guy's hospital, London, a pathologist appointed by the family, had cast doubt on Jason's death. Although inquiries are not yet complete, Dr Carey reportedly is \"very unhappy\" about the circumstances of the death and has demanded further documentation before he completes his report.</p> <p>One of the things he wants to look at is the original toxicology report. \"One of the possibilities is that he could have been drugged,\" said Mr Robinson, although he stressed the family were neither ruling this in nor out. Other concerns include the absence of a suicide note from Jason and the public nature of the place he was found.</p> <p>Errol McGowan's brother, Clifton, said there were also concerns about the belt fastened around Jason's neck which tied him to the railings. The buckle of the belt was round the front of his neck.</p> <p>\"Before you even get in a position to strangle yourself the pain alone would make you stop,\" he said.</p> <p>Last night Jason's widow Sinead, 23, told the Guardian how she last saw her husband of four months just a few minutes before midnight on December 31.</p> <p>The couple had gone with friends to the Elephant and Castle pub in Telford, opposite the Shropshire Star building where Mr McGowan worked as a production manager.</p> <p>They paid \u00a35 to get in and bought drinks and cigars. Jason asked his friends if they had any new year's resolutions but told them he was happy with a beautiful wife a home and a job he loved.</p> <p>\"There's no reason to change anything. I am totally happy,\" his wife remembers him saying.</p> <p>\"He was with his friends and his wife and having a good night,\" said one of those with him, Peter Hanson, 21, who was best man at his wedding.</p> <p>Mrs McGowan said that about 11.30pm Jason left the pub. \"He just went out. He said 'I just want five minutes to my self'. I followed him out of the pub. It was a bit cold so I just said 'I'll see you in a bit'.\"</p> <p>There was nothing remarkable about this, as the pub was packed and hot. A few minutes later she went out to look for him again, and he was nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>\"I just assumed he'd either gone down the road to his mother's house or that he'd gone to Erroll's grave.\"</p> <p>She phoned his mother and made a request for him to return to the pub if he turned up at his parents' home. But the phone calls to Jason's mobile grew more frantic throughout the night.</p> <p>He was discovered dead at 6am on railings between a field and a road about 100 yards away. Today there are some 26 wreaths at the spot where he was found.</p> <p>Mrs McGowan said the couple had planned to start a family.</p> <p>Jason had been close to his uncle and was distraught when he was discovered dead in a dilapidated semi-detached house in Urban Gardens, Telford, on July 2 last year. Mrs McGowan says: \"He was not depressed. He was just adamant he was going to find out what happened.\"</p> <p>It appears that a campaign of racist intimidation of the McGowan family originated about two and a half years ago when Erroll, a doorman at the Charlton Arms pub in Wellington, part of the Telford new town, obeyed a management order and refused entry to a previously banned white man.</p> <p>After the incident he was attacked at least twice and received numerous threats, the family said.</p> <p>He phoned police on several occasions telling them once about 10 days before he died: \"I fear for my life.\"</p> <p>On another occasion, according to the family, he was the target of a racist assault but when police were called, he and his friends were arrested.</p> <p>According to their lawyer, sources have revealed that some of the people attacking him were members of the neo-Nazi Combat 18 group.</p> <p>Sinead McGowan said that Jason was not one of the family members who had been singled out since Erroll's death, although 18 months ago a friend of his had been stabbed in Shrewsbury.</p> <p>For all the family's insistence there is some scepticism locally. While elements in the black press are supporting the family, the local press is more cautious.</p> <p>Yesterday the police moved to correct \"factual inaccuracies\" in some coverage. West Mercia said it had immediately recognised that Erroll McGowan's death \"was a serious incident and extensive resources were employed from the outset\".</p> <p>An assistant chief constable was immediately involved and a senior investigating officer assigned to the case.</p> <p>After the second death, police said, the \"likelihood of sinister implications was immediately recognised and taken into account\".</p> <p>A full report on Erroll McGowan's death had been forwarded to the coroner, and inquiries into Jason's death were continuing.</p> <p>A police spokeswoman said she was not aware Telford had any more of a problem with racial harassment or far-right organisations than any other comparable town.</p>",

Although inquiries are not yet complete, Dr Carey reportedly is \"very unhappy\" about the circumstances of the death and has demanded further documentation before he completes his report. One of the things he wants to look at is the original toxicology report. \"One of the possibilities is that he could have been drugged,\" said Mr Robinson, although he stressed the family were neither ruling this in nor out. Other concerns include the absence of a suicide note from Jason and the public nature of the place he was found. Errol McGowan's brother, Clifton, said there were also concerns about the belt fastened around Jason's neck which tied him to the railings. The buckle of the belt was round the front of his neck. \"Before you even get in a position to strangle yourself the pain alone would make you stop,\" he said. Last night Jason's widow Sinead, 23, told the Guardian how she last saw her husband of four months just a few minutes before midnight on December 31. The couple had gone with friends to the Elephant and Castle pub in Telford, opposite the Shropshire Star building where Mr McGowan worked as a production manager. They paid \u00a35 to get in and bought drinks and cigars. Jason asked his friends if they had any new year's resolutions but told them he was happy with a beautiful wife a home and a job he loved. \"There's no reason to change anything. I am totally happy,\" his wife remembers him saying. \"He was with his friends and his wife and having a good night,\" said one of those with him, Peter Hanson, 21, who was best man at his wedding. Mrs McGowan said that about 11.30pm Jason left the pub. \"He just went out. He said 'I just want five minutes to my self'. I followed him out of the pub. It was a bit cold so I just said 'I'll see you in a bit'.\" There was nothing remarkable about this, as the pub was packed and hot. A few minutes later she went out to look for him again, and he was nowhere to be seen. \"I just assumed he'd either gone down the road to his mother's house or that he'd gone to Erroll's grave.\" She phoned his mother and made a request for him to return to the pub if he turned up at his parents' home. But the phone calls to Jason's mobile grew more frantic throughout the night. He was discovered dead at 6am on railings between a field and a road about 100 yards away. Today there are some 26 wreaths at the spot where he was found. Mrs McGowan said the couple had planned to start a family. Jason had been close to his uncle and was distraught when he was discovered dead in a dilapidated semi-detached house in Urban Gardens, Telford, on July 2 last year. Mrs McGowan says: \"He was not depressed. He was just adamant he was going to find out what happened.\" It appears that a campaign of racist intimidation of the McGowan family originated about two and a half years ago when Erroll, a doorman at the Charlton Arms pub in Wellington, part of the Telford new town, obeyed a management order and refused entry to a previously banned white man. After the incident he was attacked at least twice and received numerous threats, the family said. He phoned police on several occasions telling them once about 10 days before he died: \"I fear for my life.\" On another occasion, according to the family, he was the target of a racist assault but when police were called, he and his friends were arrested. According to their lawyer, sources have revealed that some of the people attacking him were members of the neo-Nazi Combat 18 group. Sinead McGowan said that Jason was not one of the family members who had been singled out since Erroll's death, although 18 months ago a friend of his had been stabbed in Shrewsbury. For all the family's insistence there is some scepticism locally. While elements in the black press are supporting the family, the local press is more cautious. Yesterday the police moved to correct \"factual inaccuracies\" in some coverage. West Mercia said it had immediately recognised that Erroll McGowan's death \"was a serious incident and extensive resources were employed from the outset\". An assistant chief constable was immediately involved and a senior investigating officer assigned to the case. After the second death, police said, the \"likelihood of sinister implications was immediately recognised and taken into account\". A full report on Erroll McGowan's death had been forwarded to the coroner, and inquiries into Jason's death were continuing. A police spokeswoman said she was not aware Telford had any more of a problem with racial harassment or far-right organisations than any other comparable town.",

But will it wipe out the whole high street as well? </p> <p> The Royal Insititution of Chartered Surveyors seemed to be saying that last week, to publicise a slab of futurological research entitled, 2020: Visions Of the Future. In fact it doesn't quite say that.</p> <p> David Fitzpatrick, RICS Research Foundation director, admits that this particular hook was dreamt up by their PR advisers. What the report does say is that a large portion of the high street will come under pressure - both from the net and from social trends. It will need to adapt to survive.</p> <p> Mike Godliman, director of the retail researchers Verdict, agrees. Customers want to save time or have fun. \"There has been a general trend towards people wanting either quality or value,\" he says. \"That's why middle market retailers like Sainsburys and British Home Stores have had problems.\" People can, in theory, minimise 'chore' shopping at the supermarket and instead try out retail entertainment destinations, like the funky new coffee shop. </p> <p> People in the UK clearly want to supermarket shop online, according to market leader Tesco, which today took the number one slot in a survey of the fastest growing internet companies in the world by Novell. Last week Tesco annouced that, due to consumer demand, it would treble the number of stores offering online shopping. It's been trialing its Tesco Direct service at 100 stores, and plans to offer it at 300 outlets by the end of the year.</p> <p> To survive, the average high street needs to respond , says Fitzpatrick. It needs to ditch the standardised BHS style of shopping for more niche experiences, for shops that change and reinvent themselves and their markets regularly. Net shopping may even be catered for on the high street, Fitzpatrick suggests, through businesses that offer access to net shopping and serve as pick up points for deliveries.</p> <p> There could even be a resurgence in neighbourhood shops, Verdict's Mike Godliman states. \"The neighbourhood is beginning to bounce back, because people want convenience. They want to supplement their main shop with individual items, which they can do at the corner shop. Neighbourhood shops could also be a marvellous place to pick up your net purchases. No one's tried that yet. But it could help people who buy online but are out at work all day.\"</p> <p> Similar ideas are explored by William Mitchell, Dean of the MIT school of Architecture and Planning, in his new book E-Topia (published by MIT Press), which looks at the general impact of networks on urban centres. Mitchell suggests that the growth in teleworking could drive a neighbourhood renaissance. Bored teleworkers will be looking to take a break from the screen at home, but won't have time to go far. So there is an opportunity for shops that target them.</p> <p> Over the years, different infrastructures like water supplies and electricity grids have been imposed on cities and changed them, Mitchell argues. He sees the arrival of digital telecommunications as continuing the general 'fragmentation and recombination' that takes place when new infra-structures are deployed. \"You see contradictory things happening at once. In retailing, you get decentralisation of the browsing and purchasing functions. Those functions used to be within a store and now fragment and recombine with domestic space. </p> <p> \"At the same time, to achieve economies of scale, the distribution functions tend to centralise. So you get big warehouses. You get neither rampant centralisation nor rampant decentralisation but a complicated process of fragmentation and recombination.\" </p> <p> Mitchell doesn't believe that high streets and malls will die. However, he does suggest that, thanks to the efficiencies of e-commerce, bookshops may not be around in the same way in 30 years time. Those with a historical aura - for example, City Lights, in San Francisco, the honorary home of the Beats - will survive. </p> <p> British researchers are less willing to predict the death of certain retail sectors. Professor Leigh Sparks, author of the RICS Research Foundation's report on the future of shopping, suggests that - despite people generally assuming clothes shops will survive but that travel agents and financial services will be vulnerable to online competition - you can't generalise.</p> <p> \"The shops that will suffer are those that are providing functional transactions. If they're not providing anything more than that, why should I bother going to them when I can do that functional transaction every bit as well online or at a remote location?\" In other words, if a travel agent offers a different sort of experience - better information, a nice place to browse - it may survive. So what about music? This week EMI was absorbed by Time Warner-AOL. Analysts suggested that the company was looking to prepare itself for a future in which music is delivered to consumers via the net. Sparks agrees that much music will be delivered digitally in the future, but argues that many consumers may not prefer to own music in that way. \"They may prefer to go to a store, listen to a range of things, have a coffee, maybe download 10 tracks from the EMI back catalogue onto a specially made CD.\"</p> <p> Discussion about the effects of net shopping tends to focus on the high street. Might the big out-of-town superstores also come under pressure as more people shop online for groceries and other bulk purchases? Verdict's Mike Godliman believes that out of town shopping for DIY goods, electricals and furniture, will take a while to take off online, but that the threat of the net may force these real world stores to get better. \"If you think about electrical stores, they're not that enjoyable an environment to be in, for most people. But they could be brilliant. There are so many fantastic little goodies in there to play with. I think the net will act as a catalyst for electrical stores to start thinking more creatively about their space.\"</p> <p> The general conclusion seems to be that the rise of net shopping could actually be an opportunity for creative high street retailers. It's a potentially positive message, though one that ignores a few key problems, according to the RICS's David Fitzpatrick. \"We're seeing a clear divide between those who have and those who have not. Those who have access to the technology will be able to decide when they want to buy something and how they want to buy it, and then spend time with fairly high cost differentiation in the high street. So they'll go to the nice coffee shops or the nice clothes shops and they'll become more interested in retail-tainment.\"</p> <p> Those who don't have access may find themselves shut out of all sorts of retail spaces and given access to a limited range of low quality goods, he continues. So creative government intervention may be needed to solve these problems of access, he concludes. It's certainly easy to see how high streets might dodge death by reinventing themselves as \"differentiated themed experiences\". It's rather harder to see how they might be really reborn as genuine community centres.</p> <p>For more information about the RICS Research Foundation and 2020: Visions of the Future, go to <a href=\"http://www.rics-foundation.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.rics-foundation.org</a>.

Mike Godliman, director of the retail researchers Verdict, agrees. Customers want to save time or have fun. \"There has been a general trend towards people wanting either quality or value,\" he says. \"That's why middle market retailers like Sainsburys and British Home Stores have had problems.\" People can, in theory, minimise 'chore' shopping at the supermarket and instead try out retail entertainment destinations, like the funky new coffee shop. People in the UK clearly want to supermarket shop online, according to market leader Tesco, which today took the number one slot in a survey of the fastest growing internet companies in the world by Novell. Last week Tesco annouced that, due to consumer demand, it would treble the number of stores offering online shopping. It's been trialing its Tesco Direct service at 100 stores, and plans to offer it at 300 outlets by the end of the year. To survive, the average high street needs to respond , says Fitzpatrick. It needs to ditch the standardised BHS style of shopping for more niche experiences, for shops that change and reinvent themselves and their markets regularly. Net shopping may even be catered for on the high street, Fitzpatrick suggests, through businesses that offer access to net shopping and serve as pick up points for deliveries. There could even be a resurgence in neighbourhood shops, Verdict's Mike Godliman states. \"The neighbourhood is beginning to bounce back, because people want convenience. They want to supplement their main shop with individual items, which they can do at the corner shop. Neighbourhood shops could also be a marvellous place to pick up your net purchases. No one's tried that yet. But it could help people who buy online but are out at work all day.\" Similar ideas are explored by William Mitchell, Dean of the MIT school of Architecture and Planning, in his new book E-Topia (published by MIT Press), which looks at the general impact of networks on urban centres. Mitchell suggests that the growth in teleworking could drive a neighbourhood renaissance. Bored teleworkers will be looking to take a break from the screen at home, but won't have time to go far. So there is an opportunity for shops that target them. Over the years, different infrastructures like water supplies and electricity grids have been imposed on cities and changed them, Mitchell argues. He sees the arrival of digital telecommunications as continuing the general 'fragmentation and recombination' that takes place when new infra-structures are deployed. \"You see contradictory things happening at once. In retailing, you get decentralisation of the browsing and purchasing functions. Those functions used to be within a store and now fragment and recombine with domestic space. \"At the same time, to achieve economies of scale, the distribution functions tend to centralise. So you get big warehouses. You get neither rampant centralisation nor rampant decentralisation but a complicated process of fragmentation and recombination.\" Mitchell doesn't believe that high streets and malls will die. However, he does suggest that, thanks to the efficiencies of e-commerce, bookshops may not be around in the same way in 30 years time. Those with a historical aura - for example, City Lights, in San Francisco, the honorary home of the Beats - will survive. British researchers are less willing to predict the death of certain retail sectors. Professor Leigh Sparks, author of the RICS Research Foundation's report on the future of shopping, suggests that - despite people generally assuming clothes shops will survive but that travel agents and financial services will be vulnerable to online competition - you can't generalise. \"The shops that will suffer are those that are providing functional transactions. If they're not providing anything more than that, why should I bother going to them when I can do that functional transaction every bit as well online or at a remote location?\" In other words, if a travel agent offers a different sort of experience - better information, a nice place to browse - it may survive. So what about music? This week EMI was absorbed by Time Warner-AOL. Analysts suggested that the company was looking to prepare itself for a future in which music is delivered to consumers via the net. Sparks agrees that much music will be delivered digitally in the future, but argues that many consumers may not prefer to own music in that way. \"They may prefer to go to a store, listen to a range of things, have a coffee, maybe download 10 tracks from the EMI back catalogue onto a specially made CD.\" Discussion about the effects of net shopping tends to focus on the high street. Might the big out-of-town superstores also come under pressure as more people shop online for groceries and other bulk purchases? Verdict's Mike Godliman believes that out of town shopping for DIY goods, electricals and furniture, will take a while to take off online, but that the threat of the net may force these real world stores to get better. \"If you think about electrical stores, they're not that enjoyable an environment to be in, for most people. But they could be brilliant. There are so many fantastic little goodies in there to play with. I think the net will act as a catalyst for electrical stores to start thinking more creatively about their space.\" The general conclusion seems to be that the rise of net shopping could actually be an opportunity for creative high street retailers. It's a potentially positive message, though one that ignores a few key problems, according to the RICS's David Fitzpatrick. \"We're seeing a clear divide between those who have and those who have not. Those who have access to the technology will be able to decide when they want to buy something and how they want to buy it, and then spend time with fairly high cost differentiation in the high street. So they'll go to the nice coffee shops or the nice clothes shops and they'll become more interested in retail-tainment.\" Those who don't have access may find themselves shut out of all sorts of retail spaces and given access to a limited range of low quality goods, he continues. So creative government intervention may be needed to solve these problems of access, he concludes. It's certainly easy to see how high streets might dodge death by reinventing themselves as \"differentiated themed experiences\". It's rather harder to see how they might be really reborn as genuine community centres.

Suddenly, talented twenty-somethings who, in the old order of things, would have had to wait 30 years for comparable ascendancy, are running whole companies, and doing it with a hierarchy destroying directness - with email as their lingua franca. Corporate structures will never be the same again. </p> <p> In the first year it has proved a licence to lose money for all but the Old Economy manufacturers of the infrastructure (like Cisco) and the transporters of the goods bought online. Over 90% of internet companies lost money last year, although the valuations of a number of companies on the stock markets soared to levels that made some of the South Sea Bubble companies look like penny stocks. There is little doubt that in the vast business-to-business market (80% of all net activity) large profits will be made as the world's corporations make cost savings of up to 30% by offloading all their relationships with suppliers onto the web. But in the e-commerce area (business to consumer), the evidence of the first year is not encouraging.</p> <p> So far there have been two main economic effects: a massive redistribution of capital wealth to web investors - which could implode as fast as it exploded. And, second, what could prove to be a more durable redistribution of income towards consumers. They are benefiting from the way selling over the internet has triggered an orgy of price cutting (often selling below cost) in the scramble to gain market share and also from the claimed benefits of the net in removing the middle person from transactions. </p> <p> However, the evidence so far is that the benefits of removing the intermediary are often eroded by the need to spend huge sums on marketing, brand building and distribution). Industry estimates suggest that up to 55% of start-up funds are spent on marketing. Supermarkets are taking a big risk in supposing that the new paradigm of selling through the internet (then taking on the expensive job of delivering themselves) is superior to the present situation where consumers drive to shops and load and deliver their own goods at their own expense. Tesco, which now claims to be the world's biggest online supermarket, also claims to be profitable. This may be the temporary consequence of being able to charge a premium for delivery. As more supermarkets join the fray, free delivery is bound to be offered by competitors. </p> <p> In the United States, where consumers are unwilling to pay extra for home delivery, traditional supermarkets have shown little interest in online selling. Will online selling ever prove profitable? Yes, but only after a bloodbath has reduced the number of players. Even then profits may never be huge because of the nature of the web's \"clickocracy\". If you don't like the price of a fridge or a book, you may have to spend an hour tramping around shops. But on the web you can just click to a competitor to get a lower price (or get a robot to do it). Consider Hotmail. Microsoft can't charge for it because too many free alternatives like Yahoo are only a click away. Yet Microsoft can get a 40% return on sales for its products like Word and Excel software. Why? Because it has over 90% of the market and can keep prices up. As long as monopolies can be kept off the web, the consumer will be king. </p> <p>Of course, every dot.com wants to establish a brand that punters will go to first. That will happen for some of them, although brand loyalty on the web is not as strong as in the real world. But it won't necessarily be the first movers who win the war.</p> <p> It would be rash to try to pick any long term winners from the first year of startups in the UK. But from what we can see now, the most likely to make it big in the long run is Lastminute.com which sells a wide range of goods and services like hotel and holidays for last minute purchasers. This is not just because it was first on the block but because it is an unusual kind of company. </p> <p> Whereas most web start-ups sell other company's products, Lastminute specialises in selling distressed or vanishing inventory - like hotel room vacancies which won't exist a day later if unused. It is creating genuine new demand for products that would otherwise be consigned to oblivion. It could be viewed as a virtual manufacturer. </p> <p> Otherwise the typical net company, in the Wall Street Journal's words, can \"sell stuff it doesn't make, from stores it doesn't own, and ship it in trucks driven by people working for someone else\". That's true. But hang on, it's only a year since e-commerce went mainstream in the UK. We haven't even started yet. By the end of this year almost half the population will have access to the web. Once it reaches critical mass we will see things we can only dream about now.</p>",

There is little doubt that in the vast business-to-business market (80% of all net activity) large profits will be made as the world's corporations make cost savings of up to 30% by offloading all their relationships with suppliers onto the web. But in the e-commerce area (business to consumer), the evidence of the first year is not encouraging. So far there have been two main economic effects: a massive redistribution of capital wealth to web investors - which could implode as fast as it exploded. And, second, what could prove to be a more durable redistribution of income towards consumers. They are benefiting from the way selling over the internet has triggered an orgy of price cutting (often selling below cost) in the scramble to gain market share and also from the claimed benefits of the net in removing the middle person from transactions. However, the evidence so far is that the benefits of removing the intermediary are often eroded by the need to spend huge sums on marketing, brand building and distribution). Industry estimates suggest that up to 55% of start-up funds are spent on marketing. Supermarkets are taking a big risk in supposing that the new paradigm of selling through the internet (then taking on the expensive job of delivering themselves) is superior to the present situation where consumers drive to shops and load and deliver their own goods at their own expense. Tesco, which now claims to be the world's biggest online supermarket, also claims to be profitable. This may be the temporary consequence of being able to charge a premium for delivery. As more supermarkets join the fray, free delivery is bound to be offered by competitors. In the United States, where consumers are unwilling to pay extra for home delivery, traditional supermarkets have shown little interest in online selling. Will online selling ever prove profitable? Yes, but only after a bloodbath has reduced the number of players. Even then profits may never be huge because of the nature of the web's \"clickocracy\". If you don't like the price of a fridge or a book, you may have to spend an hour tramping around shops. But on the web you can just click to a competitor to get a lower price (or get a robot to do it). Consider Hotmail. Microsoft can't charge for it because too many free alternatives like Yahoo are only a click away. Yet Microsoft can get a 40% return on sales for its products like Word and Excel software. Why? Because it has over 90% of the market and can keep prices up. As long as monopolies can be kept off the web, the consumer will be king. Of course, every dot.com wants to establish a brand that punters will go to first. That will happen for some of them, although brand loyalty on the web is not as strong as in the real world. But it won't necessarily be the first movers who win the war. It would be rash to try to pick any long term winners from the first year of startups in the UK. But from what we can see now, the most likely to make it big in the long run is Lastminute.com which sells a wide range of goods and services like hotel and holidays for last minute purchasers. This is not just because it was first on the block but because it is an unusual kind of company. Whereas most web start-ups sell other company's products, Lastminute specialises in selling distressed or vanishing inventory - like hotel room vacancies which won't exist a day later if unused. It is creating genuine new demand for products that would otherwise be consigned to oblivion. It could be viewed as a virtual manufacturer. Otherwise the typical net company, in the Wall Street Journal's words, can \"sell stuff it doesn't make, from stores it doesn't own, and ship it in trucks driven by people working for someone else\". That's true. But hang on, it's only a year since e-commerce went mainstream in the UK. We haven't even started yet. By the end of this year almost half the population will have access to the web. Once it reaches critical mass we will see things we can only dream about now.",

      "bodyText": "Groups which oppose the home secretary's plan to allow former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile on health grounds will learn next week whether they can go ahead with a last-ditch legal challenge. Following a hearing lasting one-and-a-half days for permission to bring the high court action, a judge said today he would give his ruling on Monday morning. Belgium and six human rights groups applied to Mr Justice Maurice Kay for leave to seek judicial review, arguing that it would be against the public interest if they were denied access to the medical reasons why home secretary Jack Straw has said he is \"minded\" to drop extradition proceedings against the 84-year-old general on compassionate grounds. Belgium is among the four countries, led by Spain, trying to extradite Gen Pinochet on torture charges. Belgian and human rights lawyers argued that Mr Straw's decision was fatally flawed because he had failed to act \"lawfully, fairly and rationally\". The home secretary's refusal to allow them to see the independent medical report which had led to the decision that Gen Pinochet was unfit to be extradited to stand trial meant they could not make \"meaningful\" representations, or challenge the general's return home in the courts. Ms Presiley Baxendale QC, appearing for Belgium, rejected strong criticism from Mr Straw's lawyers of that country's intervention in the Pinochet case. Mr Jonathan Sumption QC, for the home secretary, had described Belgium's letter of request for disclosure of the confidential medical reasons as a \"diatribe\" against the minister's decision. But Ms Baxendale said that the request was legally justified as Belgium was, along with Spain, Switzerland and France, actively seeking Gen Pinochet's extradition. There had been a failure \"to provide a proper opportunity for Belgium to make comments on a proposed decision which has very important consequences for Belgium's position\", she said. Mr Richard Drabble QC called for disclosure of the medical reports on behalf of Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, the Redress Trust, the Association of Relatives of the Disappeared, and Justicia. A final decision by Mr Straw to drop extradition proceedings against Gen Pinochet could end the last hope of redress for victims who suffered under his regime, and their families, he said. The case raised issues of fundamental importance involving the rights of the victims now living in the countries which were seeking extradition. \"It is no answer to say that doesn't matter on the facts of this case because the secretary of state has appointed a highly respectable panel, and there is no need for any sort of independent scrutiny of the decision,\" Mr Drabble said. Mr Straw has undertaken not make a final decision on whether to allow Gen Pinochet to return to Chile while the current challenge is heard by the courts. The home secretary has repeatedly insisted that he cannot disclose details of the medical report because they are covered by the rules of medical confidentiality. Home office sources said the home secretary had appealed to lawyers acting for Gen Pinochet to waive that right to privacy, but that his appeal had been rejected. Gen Pinochet will remain under house arrest on the Wentworth Estate in Surrey until the matter is resolved.",

      "body": "<p>Most citizens, like governments, believe that the outer edges of their states should be reinforced. But in the wider context it is not consensus within states that matters, so much as consensus across them. The members of a rich nation, or a federation, may respect its borders, but if millions of people beyond those borders see them only as a barrier to safety or prosperity, then they are no longer a matter of consensus, but of dispute. </p> <p>Disputes over borders are also disputes over the extent of sovereignty; in the past they have involved secessions or rival states going to war. The new dispute sets the desire of individuals to move freely against the will of states to impede that movement. It is not a war so much as a war game, but it puts rich states on a war footing, as they go about the morose task of entrenching their frontiers. </p> <p>The spectre of the immigrant has not receded in Britain; it has simply taken another form. The asylum seeker is now the luminous apparition at the foot of the bed. Maintaining the moderate influx of immigrants from the south and east at current levels - around 60,000 per annum - entails a burgeoning visa regime (Britain currently requires visas from more than a hundred countries) and far higher rates of refusal to prospective visitors from poorer countries. </p> <p>In 1997, 0.49 per cent of US citizens requesting settlement in Britain were denied entry; the figure for the Indian subcontinent was 29 per cent. In the same year, while only 0.18 per cent of Australian visitors' applications were refused, the refusal rate for Ghanaian applications was over 30 per cent. As long as migratory pressure meets with a disproportionate response of this order from a receiving country, ambitious or desperate migrants - the two are not always easy to tell apart - will consider other means of entry. </p> <p>Sometimes it is the only way to pursue a livelihood. Imagine an entrepreneur, based in Kampala, who travels regularly between East Africa, Britain and India in the course of his business. He is a buyer and shipper, bringing goods out of the rich world which would otherwise be unobtainable in some of the communities to whom he sells on. He is also black, which is a disadvantage for anyone stepping off a plane at Heathrow or Gatwick: on his visits to Britain, questions about the duration of his stay and what he plans to do are becoming increasingly fussy and recondite; it is taking far longer to clear Immigration. </p> <p>After ten years of coming and going more or less freely, he arrives in Britain and has his passport seized. He is told he can have it back when he leaves. He duly presents himself to Immigration at the end of his stay; he is given his passport, but finds that his visa has been struck through. He is told that he will not be admitted to Britain again. This was precisely the case of a Ugandan trader described by Hirit Belai in the LRB (18 July 1996). His visa was cancelled in 1994, for no obvious reason, except that Immigration takes a dim view of people from Africa entering as businessmen or tourists. Immigration, he reasoned, couldn't accept that an African might be able to afford a holiday or an airline ticket - asylum seekers were a much easier category to deal with. Accordingly, on his return to Uganda, he arranged for a new passport and, on his next visit to the UK, he claimed asylum. The last thing he wanted was to be classified as a refugee, but he had a business to run and a family to support. </p> <p>There is no doubt that people who are not eligible for asylum are busy trying to claim it - and perhaps the numbers are high. One of the clumsier deceptions has been to pose as the national of a country where there is enough civil and military disruption to increase your chances of asylum. It is not uncommon for Pakistanis to claim they are Afghans or for Albanians to claim they are Kosovars. One case, the French police in Calais told Lib\u00e9ration last year, involved 'an African trying to make out he was from Kosovo'. </p> <p>It happens all over Europe. Moroccans, for example, pretend to be Western Saharans in order to lodge asylum claims in Spain. In the beleaguered world of immigration officials, the presence of 'bogus' or 'abusive' asylum seekers inflames the culture of suspicion, which sooner or later extends to all applicants, plausible or not. As a result, more and more people who might be eligible for asylum are denied it. Figures in recent years - excepting the period of the Kosovo crisis - bear this out.</p> <p>In Britain, according to the Home Office, there were around 21,000 application hearings in 1997, of which 85 per cent resulted in rejections. Of the appeals against rejection heard in that year, 4400 were dismissed and 130 allowed. The rate of successful asylum applications has recently risen, but the Home Office would still prefer to show high rates of refusal wherever possible, for these can be used to adduce a growing problem of 'bogusness' and 'abuse'. </p> <p>One way for governments to minimise 'asylum abuse', without abandoning the attempt to keep a tight rein on immigration, would involve setting up a body of experts to assess asylum claims in the first instance. The expertise required would include first-hand knowledge of the countries and regions from which asylum seekers came, and of refugee situations overseas; clinical experience with physical and mental trauma, familiarity with international instruments such as the 1951 Convention and a working knowledge of ad hoc measures (leave to remain, 'humanitarian' status, and so on). Such a body, it might be objected, would be predisposed to find in favour of applicants. But anyone who believes in the principle of asylum has an interest in ensuring it is not debased. Whether a board of this kind were quasi-autonomous or fully independent, as it is in Canada, it would be self-regulating. </p> <p> Britain is one among many wealthy countries that prefer to keep prejudice and ambiguity intact as a line of first defence against asylum seekers. It has recognised a need for a new body of some kind, but since the Home Office would rather discourage claims in the first place than improve the determination procedure for claimants, it has created a National Asylum Support Service. The main function of this service seems to be to dispense vouchers to asylum seekers, which they can exchange for food and goods in retail outlets that agree to take them. The Government regards anything but benefit in kind 'as an incentive to economic migration', and so the asylum seeker's weekly cash allowance is limited to \u00a310.</p> <p>Some local authorities had already begun to operate a voucher system after the 1996 Immigration and Asylum Act - one could see the results in supermarket queues, where cashiers, forbidden to give change, urged refugee customers to top up to the full value of the voucher with a handful of wrapped sweets, a six-pack of instant coffee sachets or a cookery magazine (cover story: 'Going Balsamic'). This, rather than people opting for specific countries of refuge, is what we ought properly to describe as 'asylum shopping'. </p> <p>The British Government has claimed that withholding cash benefits brings it into line with other countries which provide 'support in kind', but if that is desirable, why not look to the great normative model of Africa, which contains nearly half of the world's refugees, and simply distribute a monthly per capita allocation of oil, salt, sugar and beans? Of course, the countries Britain has in mind - Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark - are members of the EU, and the strategy here is parity of penalisation, conceived in the hope that asylum seekers will not prefer one EU member state over another on the grounds of its being a 'soft option'. </p> <p>The arguments about why asylum seekers end up in certain countries and not others are intricate. They have to do with family connections, colonial history, relays of information and, above all, with the traffickers in whose hands refugees put their lives. Social security scamming appears to come low on the list of priorities for the survivor of an 'anti-terrorist' operation in Turkish Kurdistan who leaves his village on horseback, calls on his cousins, raises the cost of a passage to sanctuary, travels by bus and truck to Izmir or Istanbul, buys a place on a boat to Albania and, three months later, still in the hands of a trafficking network, is invited to step out of a lorry on the A3 and make his way to a police station in Guildford. Nor would it have upset him to discover that by failing to claim asylum at his port of entry, he had forfeited his social security entitlement. </p> <p>The Refugee Council in Britain has argued that the money going into the creation of the National Asylum Support Service would have been better spent on clearing Britain's backlog of unresolved asylum cases. But governments are less interested in devising a fair asylum policy than in whether or not they are seen by electorates as willing hosts to the 'scum of the earth' (the Dover Express). By failing to address the backlog of unresolved applications or to rethink the assessment of claims in the first place, governments have compounded the situation that anti-immigrationists find so deplorable. </p> <p>Britain's backlog leapt from 12,000 undecided cases in 1989 to 72,000 in 1991 and stood, at the end of 1999, at around 100,000. Britain is not the only country with this problem - it has arisen in Canada, Australia, Sweden and the Netherlands. It is normally solved by formal or de facto amnesty, but the longer it takes to clear a backlog, the likelier it is that the system will become discredited. Once a claimant has been hung out to dry for years without a decision on his status, it no longer matters whether he is eventually refused, since the length of his stay will make it hard to deport him without a public outcry or a lengthy legal battle. In practice, most of the people whose applications are finally refused after years of deliberation are unlikely ever to leave the country. This is immigration by government default. </p> <p>The backlog in Britain became entrenched when the Home Office attempted to speed up its decisions on asylum claims: refusal rates soared and the appellate system was unable to cope. It is a fair guess that a proportion of those who were refused felt that they had a strong case to appeal. Swift decisions, based on a 'no immigration' agenda, are not as helpful as good decisions; and backlogs, as the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association and others have suggested, encourage 'unfounded applications for asylum', as word travels back down the line that, if rumbled, a dubious claimant will in any case be lost in the system for years. In 1997, according to one controversial estimate, there were nearly 250,000 unsuccessful asylum applicants staying on in Britain without authorisation. </p> <p>A country that fails to operate a fair and reasonably fast determination procedure cannot enforce a 'removals' policy, and without the possibility of deportations - to shuck off the euphemism - the entire process of asylum determination is worthless from the outset: one may as well throw everyone out or let everyone in. On the face of it, recent British administrations have played to the anti-immigration gallery with a no-nonsense posture on asylum, while in reality multiplying the grounds for its anxiety. The Labour Government's Immigration and Asylum legislation, finalised in 1999 and effective from next April, indicates no change whatsoever. </p> <p> Posture may well be one of the reasons asylum policy has become so degraded. As the nation-state grows harder to patrol, governments are thrown back on gesture and salesmanship. Sovereignty is an adaptable creature, and very durable, but under the new pressures of human movement, sovereign assertion is becoming a rictus on the physiognomy of nations that once wore the mask quite amenably. Globalisation puts stress on international borders - there were 86 million arrivals in Britain in 1998 - and immigration officials in the rich world can still be stretched to the limit by modest numbers of illegal migrants. </p> <p>The more freely capital and goods move around the rich world, the harder it becomes to inhibit the movement of people, with the hostility of conservative voters to foreign influx growing in proportion as the ability to restrict it dwindles. The power of government to reverse this process is no greater than it was in the past, but its capacity to signal an intention, and project that signal, is far stronger. </p> <p>This was not always the case. In 1916 there were riots in Fulham, a part of London plagued by poverty and housing shortages. Fulham was also a reception area for Belgian evacuees. Residents believed the Belgians were receiving higher benefits than families of British servicemen dying in the trenches. The response to the riots was a policy of compulsory conscription for Belgian males. The scrutiny of the liberal press and the influential voice of the voluntary sector would make a similar response nowadays - round-ups and mass deportations of rejected asylum seekers, for example - harder for a government to envisage, especially in peacetime, however popular it might be with certain sections of the electorate. </p> <p>In 1937, at the height of the Spanish Civil War, the British Government was pressured by anti-Fascist groups and charitable organisations into receiving 4,000 Basque children. They were camped out on farmland in the Kent countryside. The news that Bilbao had fallen led to uproar among the children, some of whom broke camp in the hope of returning and enlisting with the Republic. Within days, the settlement had been summarily dispersed and brothers and sisters separated, as they were packed off to remote parts of England and Wales. </p> <p>The Vietnamese refugees who came in under the UN programme in the 1970s and 1980s were also obliged to disperse to locations designated by the British Government. One can imagine comparable action today - it has begun on a smaller scale with the dispersal of asylum seekers - but the more brazen the government initiative, the greater the flurry of objections from the media, the voluntary organisations and the courts would be. No wonder posture is preferable to policy. Refugees are at the mercy of disabled governments with stern faces - and so is the anti-immigration voter, who regards cuts in cash hand-outs to asylum seekers as a sign that the party of power has his interests at heart. But that is all it is: a sign. </p> <p>Who exactly is it intended for? In some European countries - France, and lately, Austria and Switzerland - the anti-immigration vote is significant. In Britain there are a few suspects on the extreme Right, but beyond this margin, it is harder to identify the cohort of stout Englishmen with a passion for chalky cliffs, white lavatory tiles and virgin brides. Perhaps they are out there. But if so, they are not being drawn on the subject of asylum seekers. In 1997, three-quarters of the respondents to a survey by the Institute for Public Policy Research agreed that 'most refugees in Britain are in need of our help and support' and only 12 per cent took the view that 'most people claiming to be refugees are not real refugees.' </p> <p>The minority has a keen eye on the media, and bigotry, for the media, is a better story than tolerance. This all falls within the realm of signalling, which goes some way to explaining the tendency to minority appeasement in a period of government by semaphore. </p> <p>More worrying conclusions about the IPPR study are reached by Tony Kushner, a historian at the University of Southampton, and Katharine Knox, a former Refugee Council officer, in a superb history of refugees in Britain, compiled largely from local historical sources. As campaigning historians, Kushner and Knox were encouraged by the IPPR survey, but dismayed by the fact that, even though only a small minority were sceptical about asylum claims, roughly 40 per cent of respondents were not prepared to disagree outright with the statement that most claims were fraudulent. </p> <p>They take this to prove that 'a century questioning the legitimacy of refugees has not been without a profound and cumulative impact' (an infectious cynicism, Hannah Arendt would have argued, transmitted to their grudging hosts by the regimes that first reviled them). 'Why is it,' Kushner and Knox go on to ask, 'that British governments past and present continue to pay greater attention to the hostile 12 per cent than the sympathetic 75 per cent?' The bigger question, perhaps, is why a government of liberal persuasion would not consider the reticent 40 per cent worth winning over - unless, of course, it was not a liberal-minded government at all. </p> <p> London, in the closing weeks of 1999: walking back from my children's primary school, I see a young woman from Kosovo crossing at Prince of Wales Road and heading towards Camden Town. She walks with the privacy and haste of people in big cities, and in that much, she is concealed, or no longer who she was. Instinctively I quicken my pace, to greet her, but almost at once, I find the way congested by a mob of half-recalled people and images, rowdy and difficult to negotiate. After a moment's hesitation, I give up and turn at the corner for home. </p> <p>Flora was one of two sisters who had left Pristina at the end of 1998, travelled down into Albania and paid their way on a gommone to Italy. I met them at the Regina Pacis reception centre near Puglia a few weeks after they arrived. Even though we spoke at length - their English was quite good, and they had set their sights on London, where they had an aunt - it wasn't clear how deep the fear of persecution, or the grounds for that fear, really went with these two women. (Had they stayed another six months in Kosovo, they would have come to know it intimately.) </p> <p>It struck me, on reflection, that my failure to greet Flora had to do with doubts about her claim to humanitarian status as a route out of the former Yugoslavia. A few weeks after meeting the sisters, I'd been to Kosovo and found their family. The father was a jovial chancer, bluff and hospitable; the mother was quite the opposite - a troubled person, shaken by her daughters' absence. There was another aunt whose husband, a musician with a nationalist lilt to his work, had had a rough time in prison. I gave the family news of the two sisters and some photos, which upset them. I was their guest for the best part of an evening, but again, I could never fully establish in what way the sisters had been persecuted. </p> <p>A day or so later I found myself in a village west of Pristina where the KLA had ambushed a group of Serbian police. There was blood in the snow and a litter of spent cartridges. The village mosque had been shot to ruins. Most of the houses had already been abandoned earlier in the year, but one family had stayed, and they had paid the price of the ambush in the KLA's stead. Serbian police had dragged them to the scene of the crime and beaten them. The able-bodied man in the house had been taken away, leaving only a limping, terrified family of the very elderly or very young. </p> <p>There were worse scenes in Kosovo before the Nato intervention, but the memory of that particular farmstead would have crossed my mind as I saw Flora again in North London and the ghost of a moral judgment must have flickered there in passing, too. It's as though I had some model of the exemplary refugee - as though my high-mindedness would have been satisfied by the sight of the family from the abandoned village rumbling towards Camden Lock in their cart, rather than a glimpse of Flora walking along briskly and comfortably in her new guise as a Londoner. Yet who is to say what constitutes fear of persecution? After all, Flora had wanted to be a nurse, and Serbia had cleansed the public health sector of ethnic Albanian staff years ago. </p> <p>There was something more petulant about my reserve, to do with the fact that refugees can be importunate people during their settling-in period. Fellow expatriates provide much in the way of support, but there are still questions, favours, conversations which any halfway generous character might properly follow up. Effort is required, however, small tasks that disrupt the rich person's love affair with his own stress. And the prospect of that disruption must have seemed tiresome - that neediness, too, no doubt.</p> <p> I was prone to a view of the uninvited that was no better than it had been a year earlier, when I'd gazed at the minuscule figures in the lunar field of the nightsights, making for the beach in Italy. It was even ambivalent, I am sure, on the issue of school, where I'd just left two small boys before catching sight of Flora. Dozens of children from the former Yugoslavia attend the school, along with a scattering of francophone African and Somali pupils, all of them with parents or wards who have leave to remain or Convention status. A sour parental anxiety stirs from its depths at the thought of language difficulties in the classroom and the diversion of resources to cope with them. </p> <p>It has no basis in fact. Much of the time it's hidden, in silent contention with the one-world equanimity of the bien pensant parent whose children learn about the death of the rainforests. But on bad days it will put in an appearance. It, too, is a sign of impatience with other people's needs. I have instant access, any time I like, to the mentality of the anti-asylum voter. </p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">LRB</a>.

It is not uncommon for Pakistanis to claim they are Afghans or for Albanians to claim they are Kosovars. One case, the French police in Calais told Lib\u00e9ration last year, involved 'an African trying to make out he was from Kosovo'. It happens all over Europe. Moroccans, for example, pretend to be Western Saharans in order to lodge asylum claims in Spain. In the beleaguered world of immigration officials, the presence of 'bogus' or 'abusive' asylum seekers inflames the culture of suspicion, which sooner or later extends to all applicants, plausible or not. As a result, more and more people who might be eligible for asylum are denied it. Figures in recent years - excepting the period of the Kosovo crisis - bear this out. In Britain, according to the Home Office, there were around 21,000 application hearings in 1997, of which 85 per cent resulted in rejections. Of the appeals against rejection heard in that year, 4400 were dismissed and 130 allowed. The rate of successful asylum applications has recently risen, but the Home Office would still prefer to show high rates of refusal wherever possible, for these can be used to adduce a growing problem of 'bogusness' and 'abuse'. One way for governments to minimise 'asylum abuse', without abandoning the attempt to keep a tight rein on immigration, would involve setting up a body of experts to assess asylum claims in the first instance. The expertise required would include first-hand knowledge of the countries and regions from which asylum seekers came, and of refugee situations overseas; clinical experience with physical and mental trauma, familiarity with international instruments such as the 1951 Convention and a working knowledge of ad hoc measures (leave to remain, 'humanitarian' status, and so on). Such a body, it might be objected, would be predisposed to find in favour of applicants. But anyone who believes in the principle of asylum has an interest in ensuring it is not debased. Whether a board of this kind were quasi-autonomous or fully independent, as it is in Canada, it would be self-regulating. Britain is one among many wealthy countries that prefer to keep prejudice and ambiguity intact as a line of first defence against asylum seekers. It has recognised a need for a new body of some kind, but since the Home Office would rather discourage claims in the first place than improve the determination procedure for claimants, it has created a National Asylum Support Service. The main function of this service seems to be to dispense vouchers to asylum seekers, which they can exchange for food and goods in retail outlets that agree to take them. The Government regards anything but benefit in kind 'as an incentive to economic migration', and so the asylum seeker's weekly cash allowance is limited to \u00a310. Some local authorities had already begun to operate a voucher system after the 1996 Immigration and Asylum Act - one could see the results in supermarket queues, where cashiers, forbidden to give change, urged refugee customers to top up to the full value of the voucher with a handful of wrapped sweets, a six-pack of instant coffee sachets or a cookery magazine (cover story: 'Going Balsamic'). This, rather than people opting for specific countries of refuge, is what we ought properly to describe as 'asylum shopping'. The British Government has claimed that withholding cash benefits brings it into line with other countries which provide 'support in kind', but if that is desirable, why not look to the great normative model of Africa, which contains nearly half of the world's refugees, and simply distribute a monthly per capita allocation of oil, salt, sugar and beans? Of course, the countries Britain has in mind - Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark - are members of the EU, and the strategy here is parity of penalisation, conceived in the hope that asylum seekers will not prefer one EU member state over another on the grounds of its being a 'soft option'. The arguments about why asylum seekers end up in certain countries and not others are intricate. They have to do with family connections, colonial history, relays of information and, above all, with the traffickers in whose hands refugees put their lives. Social security scamming appears to come low on the list of priorities for the survivor of an 'anti-terrorist' operation in Turkish Kurdistan who leaves his village on horseback, calls on his cousins, raises the cost of a passage to sanctuary, travels by bus and truck to Izmir or Istanbul, buys a place on a boat to Albania and, three months later, still in the hands of a trafficking network, is invited to step out of a lorry on the A3 and make his way to a police station in Guildford. Nor would it have upset him to discover that by failing to claim asylum at his port of entry, he had forfeited his social security entitlement. The Refugee Council in Britain has argued that the money going into the creation of the National Asylum Support Service would have been better spent on clearing Britain's backlog of unresolved asylum cases. But governments are less interested in devising a fair asylum policy than in whether or not they are seen by electorates as willing hosts to the 'scum of the earth' (the Dover Express). By failing to address the backlog of unresolved applications or to rethink the assessment of claims in the first place, governments have compounded the situation that anti-immigrationists find so deplorable. Britain's backlog leapt from 12,000 undecided cases in 1989 to 72,000 in 1991 and stood, at the end of 1999, at around 100,000. Britain is not the only country with this problem - it has arisen in Canada, Australia, Sweden and the Netherlands. It is normally solved by formal or de facto amnesty, but the longer it takes to clear a backlog, the likelier it is that the system will become discredited. Once a claimant has been hung out to dry for years without a decision on his status, it no longer matters whether he is eventually refused, since the length of his stay will make it hard to deport him without a public outcry or a lengthy legal battle. In practice, most of the people whose applications are finally refused after years of deliberation are unlikely ever to leave the country. This is immigration by government default. The backlog in Britain became entrenched when the Home Office attempted to speed up its decisions on asylum claims: refusal rates soared and the appellate system was unable to cope. It is a fair guess that a proportion of those who were refused felt that they had a strong case to appeal. Swift decisions, based on a 'no immigration' agenda, are not as helpful as good decisions; and backlogs, as the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association and others have suggested, encourage 'unfounded applications for asylum', as word travels back down the line that, if rumbled, a dubious claimant will in any case be lost in the system for years. In 1997, according to one controversial estimate, there were nearly 250,000 unsuccessful asylum applicants staying on in Britain without authorisation. A country that fails to operate a fair and reasonably fast determination procedure cannot enforce a 'removals' policy, and without the possibility of deportations - to shuck off the euphemism - the entire process of asylum determination is worthless from the outset: one may as well throw everyone out or let everyone in. On the face of it, recent British administrations have played to the anti-immigration gallery with a no-nonsense posture on asylum, while in reality multiplying the grounds for its anxiety. The Labour Government's Immigration and Asylum legislation, finalised in 1999 and effective from next April, indicates no change whatsoever. Posture may well be one of the reasons asylum policy has become so degraded. As the nation-state grows harder to patrol, governments are thrown back on gesture and salesmanship. Sovereignty is an adaptable creature, and very durable, but under the new pressures of human movement, sovereign assertion is becoming a rictus on the physiognomy of nations that once wore the mask quite amenably. Globalisation puts stress on international borders - there were 86 million arrivals in Britain in 1998 - and immigration officials in the rich world can still be stretched to the limit by modest numbers of illegal migrants. The more freely capital and goods move around the rich world, the harder it becomes to inhibit the movement of people, with the hostility of conservative voters to foreign influx growing in proportion as the ability to restrict it dwindles. The power of government to reverse this process is no greater than it was in the past, but its capacity to signal an intention, and project that signal, is far stronger. This was not always the case. In 1916 there were riots in Fulham, a part of London plagued by poverty and housing shortages. Fulham was also a reception area for Belgian evacuees. Residents believed the Belgians were receiving higher benefits than families of British servicemen dying in the trenches. The response to the riots was a policy of compulsory conscription for Belgian males. The scrutiny of the liberal press and the influential voice of the voluntary sector would make a similar response nowadays - round-ups and mass deportations of rejected asylum seekers, for example - harder for a government to envisage, especially in peacetime, however popular it might be with certain sections of the electorate. In 1937, at the height of the Spanish Civil War, the British Government was pressured by anti-Fascist groups and charitable organisations into receiving 4,000 Basque children. They were camped out on farmland in the Kent countryside. The news that Bilbao had fallen led to uproar among the children, some of whom broke camp in the hope of returning and enlisting with the Republic. Within days, the settlement had been summarily dispersed and brothers and sisters separated, as they were packed off to remote parts of England and Wales. The Vietnamese refugees who came in under the UN programme in the 1970s and 1980s were also obliged to disperse to locations designated by the British Government. One can imagine comparable action today - it has begun on a smaller scale with the dispersal of asylum seekers - but the more brazen the government initiative, the greater the flurry of objections from the media, the voluntary organisations and the courts would be. No wonder posture is preferable to policy. Refugees are at the mercy of disabled governments with stern faces - and so is the anti-immigration voter, who regards cuts in cash hand-outs to asylum seekers as a sign that the party of power has his interests at heart. But that is all it is: a sign. Who exactly is it intended for? In some European countries - France, and lately, Austria and Switzerland - the anti-immigration vote is significant. In Britain there are a few suspects on the extreme Right, but beyond this margin, it is harder to identify the cohort of stout Englishmen with a passion for chalky cliffs, white lavatory tiles and virgin brides. Perhaps they are out there. But if so, they are not being drawn on the subject of asylum seekers. In 1997, three-quarters of the respondents to a survey by the Institute for Public Policy Research agreed that 'most refugees in Britain are in need of our help and support' and only 12 per cent took the view that 'most people claiming to be refugees are not real refugees.' The minority has a keen eye on the media, and bigotry, for the media, is a better story than tolerance. This all falls within the realm of signalling, which goes some way to explaining the tendency to minority appeasement in a period of government by semaphore. More worrying conclusions about the IPPR study are reached by Tony Kushner, a historian at the University of Southampton, and Katharine Knox, a former Refugee Council officer, in a superb history of refugees in Britain, compiled largely from local historical sources. As campaigning historians, Kushner and Knox were encouraged by the IPPR survey, but dismayed by the fact that, even though only a small minority were sceptical about asylum claims, roughly 40 per cent of respondents were not prepared to disagree outright with the statement that most claims were fraudulent. They take this to prove that 'a century questioning the legitimacy of refugees has not been without a profound and cumulative impact' (an infectious cynicism, Hannah Arendt would have argued, transmitted to their grudging hosts by the regimes that first reviled them). 'Why is it,' Kushner and Knox go on to ask, 'that British governments past and present continue to pay greater attention to the hostile 12 per cent than the sympathetic 75 per cent?' The bigger question, perhaps, is why a government of liberal persuasion would not consider the reticent 40 per cent worth winning over - unless, of course, it was not a liberal-minded government at all. London, in the closing weeks of 1999: walking back from my children's primary school, I see a young woman from Kosovo crossing at Prince of Wales Road and heading towards Camden Town. She walks with the privacy and haste of people in big cities, and in that much, she is concealed, or no longer who she was. Instinctively I quicken my pace, to greet her, but almost at once, I find the way congested by a mob of half-recalled people and images, rowdy and difficult to negotiate. After a moment's hesitation, I give up and turn at the corner for home. Flora was one of two sisters who had left Pristina at the end of 1998, travelled down into Albania and paid their way on a gommone to Italy. I met them at the Regina Pacis reception centre near Puglia a few weeks after they arrived. Even though we spoke at length - their English was quite good, and they had set their sights on London, where they had an aunt - it wasn't clear how deep the fear of persecution, or the grounds for that fear, really went with these two women. (Had they stayed another six months in Kosovo, they would have come to know it intimately.) It struck me, on reflection, that my failure to greet Flora had to do with doubts about her claim to humanitarian status as a route out of the former Yugoslavia. A few weeks after meeting the sisters, I'd been to Kosovo and found their family. The father was a jovial chancer, bluff and hospitable; the mother was quite the opposite - a troubled person, shaken by her daughters' absence. There was another aunt whose husband, a musician with a nationalist lilt to his work, had had a rough time in prison. I gave the family news of the two sisters and some photos, which upset them. I was their guest for the best part of an evening, but again, I could never fully establish in what way the sisters had been persecuted. A day or so later I found myself in a village west of Pristina where the KLA had ambushed a group of Serbian police. There was blood in the snow and a litter of spent cartridges. The village mosque had been shot to ruins. Most of the houses had already been abandoned earlier in the year, but one family had stayed, and they had paid the price of the ambush in the KLA's stead. Serbian police had dragged them to the scene of the crime and beaten them. The able-bodied man in the house had been taken away, leaving only a limping, terrified family of the very elderly or very young. There were worse scenes in Kosovo before the Nato intervention, but the memory of that particular farmstead would have crossed my mind as I saw Flora again in North London and the ghost of a moral judgment must have flickered there in passing, too. It's as though I had some model of the exemplary refugee - as though my high-mindedness would have been satisfied by the sight of the family from the abandoned village rumbling towards Camden Lock in their cart, rather than a glimpse of Flora walking along briskly and comfortably in her new guise as a Londoner. Yet who is to say what constitutes fear of persecution? After all, Flora had wanted to be a nurse, and Serbia had cleansed the public health sector of ethnic Albanian staff years ago. There was something more petulant about my reserve, to do with the fact that refugees can be importunate people during their settling-in period. Fellow expatriates provide much in the way of support, but there are still questions, favours, conversations which any halfway generous character might properly follow up. Effort is required, however, small tasks that disrupt the rich person's love affair with his own stress. And the prospect of that disruption must have seemed tiresome - that neediness, too, no doubt. I was prone to a view of the uninvited that was no better than it had been a year earlier, when I'd gazed at the minuscule figures in the lunar field of the nightsights, making for the beach in Italy. It was even ambivalent, I am sure, on the issue of school, where I'd just left two small boys before catching sight of Flora. Dozens of children from the former Yugoslavia attend the school, along with a scattering of francophone African and Somali pupils, all of them with parents or wards who have leave to remain or Convention status. A sour parental anxiety stirs from its depths at the thought of language difficulties in the classroom and the diversion of resources to cope with them. It has no basis in fact. Much of the time it's hidden, in silent contention with the one-world equanimity of the bien pensant parent whose children learn about the death of the rainforests. But on bad days it will put in an appearance. It, too, is a sign of impatience with other people's needs. I have instant access, any time I like, to the mentality of the anti-asylum voter. \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

      "bodyText": "Austria was warned last night that it could become a pariah, as conservatives negotiated to form a government with J\u00f6rg Haider, a far-right politician who once praised Adolf Hitler's employment policies. A chorus of condemnation from Israel, Germany, France, Italy, Sweden and the Czech Republic descended on the central European state as Mr Haider scurried to apologise for past pro-Nazi remarks and the prospective chancellor in the centre-right alliance, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, tried to allay international concerns. In Jerusalem, Israel's Nobel peace laureate, Shimon Peres, compared Mr Haider's rise with that of Hitler. \"[Hitler] was from Austria and any man who raises so many doubts must also raise the alarm everywhere,\" said Mr Peres, minister of regional cooperation in the government of the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak. Coalition talks began on Tuesday between Mr Sch\u00fcssel's People's party and Mr Haider's Freedom party after Mr Sch\u00fcssel refused to renew his long-time coalition with the leading Social Democrats. Mr Barak, who is attending a conference on the Holocaust in Sweden, said the rise of the extreme right in Austria was extremely worrying: \"For every Jew in the world it is a highly disturbing signal... it touches every one of us.\" Israel has threatened to break off diplomatic relations with Vienna if Mr Haider joins the government. Also at the conference, Austria's acting chancellor, Viktor Klima, said that anyone who minimised Nazi atrocities lacked \"the basic human qualities that are a precondition for any responsibility in politics\". Germany was no less forthright last night. A foreign ministry spokesman, Andreas Michaelis, said: \"Austria has a special responsibility because of its membership in the European Union, as well as the fact that it will soon hold the chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\" A senior member of Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's ruling Social Democrats accused Mr Sch\u00fcssel of damaging his country's standing. \"His strategy runs the risk of sending Austria into isolation,\" said Gernot Erler, deputy chief whip of the SPD. \"No one in Europe trusts Haider and it won't be just Israel that draws the consequences.\" A spokeswoman for France's foreign ministry said Austria would put itself into a \"deplorable position\" if Mr Haider joined the government. The condemnation was on a scale not seen since Kurt Waldheim was elected Austrian president in 1986, despite having lied about his wartime service as an army intelligence officer.

In the second, at Auckland in March 1955, Hutton wouldn't have been pleased when his side were bowled out for 246 in reply to New Zealand's modest 200. He was much happier 106 minutes later, as NZ were bundled out for 26: Frank Tyson and Brian Statham, the new-ball pair who had demolished the Aussies, did the early damage, helped by the deceptive medium-pace of Yorkshire's Bob Appleyard.

Perhaps the oddest instance in Test cricket came at Bridgetown in 1982-83, when West Indies needed only one run in their second innings to beat India. Syed Kirmani, the Indian wicketkeeper, came on to bowl for the first time in Test cricket, and his second delivery was a no-ball, which won the match for West Indies. Kirmani was left with the odd-looking bowling figures of 0.1-0-0-0 (no-balls didn't count against the bowler then).</p> <p><strong>In which other sport did WG Grace captain England?</strong> ask Chris and Liz Bateman</p> <p>In his youth WG was an impressive allround athlete who excelled over the hurdles on the athletics track. He was also capable of throwing the cricket ball over 100 yards - with either hand. But it was at bowls that he captained England, after his cricket Test career was finished.</p> <p> <strong>Who was voted Young Cricketer of the Year in 1963?</strong> asks Colin Herbert</p> <p> The Cricket Writers' Club's Young Cricketer of the Year for 1963 was one Geoffrey Boycott, 22, who had just finished second in the national first-class averages with 1628 runs at 45.22 in his first full season for Yorkshire. He played the first of his 108 Test matches the following year. In those days there wasn't a worldwide award.</p> <p><strong>Is it true that a Test match was once left drawn because one team had to leave to catch the boat home?</strong> asks David Slater</p> <p>It actually happened twice. The most famous occasion was the \"Timeless Test\" of 1938-39 at Durban, when England, set 696 to win by South Africa, had reached 654-5 on the tenth day when they had to leave to catch the train to Cape Town to meet the boat home. But it had also happened nine years before, in Jamaica. England batted first and made 849 (Andy Sandham 325, the first Test triple-century). West Indies then made 286, but England, 563 ahead, didn't enforce the follow-on: instead they batted again and made 272-9. The declaration left West Indies the little matter of 836 to win: by the end of the seventh day they had reached 408-5 (George Headley 223). Rain washed out the next two days, at which point England had to go home - so another \"Timeless Test\" was left drawn.</p> <p><strong>I am trying to complete a quiz and cannot verify one of my answers. The question is \"Italian gypsy (or member of a cricket club)?\" I know that \"zingaro\" is Italian for gypsy, but what's the link with cricket?</strong> asks Phil Heathcote</p> <p>The link is the I Zingari Cricket Club, which was one of the first \"wandering\" club sides. It's nomadic nature - it has no home ground - probably led to the \"gypsy\" link. I Zingari was particularly strong at the end of the 19th century, when it played several first-class matches, and the club still exists today. For many years the secretary remained anonymous: the only way to contact him (or her) was to address a letter to \"A.Secret, c/o Lord's Cricket Ground\".</p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly</em></p>",

But it had also happened nine years before, in Jamaica. England batted first and made 849 (Andy Sandham 325, the first Test triple-century). West Indies then made 286, but England, 563 ahead, didn't enforce the follow-on: instead they batted again and made 272-9. The declaration left West Indies the little matter of 836 to win: by the end of the seventh day they had reached 408-5 (George Headley 223). Rain washed out the next two days, at which point England had to go home - so another \"Timeless Test\" was left drawn. I am trying to complete a quiz and cannot verify one of my answers. The question is \"Italian gypsy (or member of a cricket club)?\" I know that \"zingaro\" is Italian for gypsy, but what's the link with cricket? asks Phil Heathcote The link is the I Zingari Cricket Club, which was one of the first \"wandering\" club sides. It's nomadic nature - it has no home ground - probably led to the \"gypsy\" link. I Zingari was particularly strong at the end of the 19th century, when it played several first-class matches, and the club still exists today. For many years the secretary remained anonymous: the only way to contact him (or her) was to address a letter to \"A.Secret, c/o Lord's Cricket Ground\".

      "body": "<p>Frank MacShane, who has died aged 72, wrote resurrectionist biographies of Ford Madox Ford, Raymond Chandler, John O'Hara and James Jones between 1965 and 1985. MacShane was seeking to reclaim the reputation of writers who had once enjoyed status or sales, but had either failed to be taken seriously, or whose later careers had gone awry. </p> <p>Apart from Ford, his subjects were a trio of hard-drinking, self-destructive men, troubled and unhappy in their dealings with women. And it was the women who seemed to bring coherence to MacShane as a biographer. When he wrote of Cissy Chandler, desperately trying to hide the 20-year difference in age between herself and her husband Raymond, or of Gloria Mosolino, the gorgeous, tough-talking, brash blonde who met James Jones while she was working on The Seven Year Itch as a stand-in for Marilyn Monroe, MacShane's pages come alive. </p> <p>There was never a hint of Kitty Kelleyism about his work. Always reasonable, competent, decent, and earnest, one regrets the absence of malice or edge. MacShane's work was criticised for its lack of \"critical acuity\" and for the simplistic and platitudinous quality of his critical judgments. </p> <p>MacShane grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of a journalist who became the publisher of the New York Journal-American, flagship of the Hearst newspaper chain. He graduated from Harvard in 1949, received a master's degree at Yale, and was awarded a DPhil at Oxford in 1955. He taught at McGill University in Montreal for two years, was a visiting lecturer in English at Vassar College in 1958-59, and then was appointed an associate professor at the University of California at Berkeley. </p> <p>By that time MacShane had begun his Ford biography. Though he interviewed many people who had known Ford, his is essentially a story told from published sources. Though warmly received, subsequent biographies of Ford have a stronger claim on our attention. </p> <p>\"If you want to know what California is like, read Raymond Chandler.\" MacShane received this advice not long after he moved to Berkeley. When his Chandler biography appeared in 1976, the novelist had begun to receive enthusiastic critical attention. MacShane presented him as a major writer who \"rose from the blank anonymity of America\". Overcoming a \"tortured and lonely life,\" Chandler became a writer whose vision of America has grown in persuasive power. The Life Of Raymond Chandler was MacShane's book most likely to endure. </p> <p>His plea to take the life and perceptions of O'Hara seriously was a harder sell. By praising O'Hara's precinct cop who picks up a phone and asks \"Wukkan I do fya?\" MacShane put his finger on what was least authentic in the writer's documentation of American life. </p> <p>MacShane taught at Williams College from 1965-67, then went to Columbia University. There he founded the graduate writing division and taught creative writing. He published translations of Miguel Serrano, co-edited Borges On Writing, and edited two volumes of American travel writing. </p> <p>He remained an enthusiastic and dedicated teacher until Alzheimer's disease ended his academic career in 1992. </p> <p>He is survived by his son Nicholas. </p> <p>\u0095 Frank MacShane, biographer, born October 19 1927; died November 15 1999</p>",

      "bodyText": "Frank MacShane, who has died aged 72, wrote resurrectionist biographies of Ford Madox Ford, Raymond Chandler, John O'Hara and James Jones between 1965 and 1985. MacShane was seeking to reclaim the reputation of writers who had once enjoyed status or sales, but had either failed to be taken seriously, or whose later careers had gone awry. Apart from Ford, his subjects were a trio of hard-drinking, self-destructive men, troubled and unhappy in their dealings with women. And it was the women who seemed to bring coherence to MacShane as a biographer. When he wrote of Cissy Chandler, desperately trying to hide the 20-year difference in age between herself and her husband Raymond, or of Gloria Mosolino, the gorgeous, tough-talking, brash blonde who met James Jones while she was working on The Seven Year Itch as a stand-in for Marilyn Monroe, MacShane's pages come alive. There was never a hint of Kitty Kelleyism about his work. Always reasonable, competent, decent, and earnest, one regrets the absence of malice or edge. MacShane's work was criticised for its lack of \"critical acuity\" and for the simplistic and platitudinous quality of his critical judgments. MacShane grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of a journalist who became the publisher of the New York Journal-American, flagship of the Hearst newspaper chain. He graduated from Harvard in 1949, received a master's degree at Yale, and was awarded a DPhil at Oxford in 1955. He taught at McGill University in Montreal for two years, was a visiting lecturer in English at Vassar College in 1958-59, and then was appointed an associate professor at the University of California at Berkeley. By that time MacShane had begun his Ford biography. Though he interviewed many people who had known Ford, his is essentially a story told from published sources. Though warmly received, subsequent biographies of Ford have a stronger claim on our attention. \"If you want to know what California is like, read Raymond Chandler.\" MacShane received this advice not long after he moved to Berkeley. When his Chandler biography appeared in 1976, the novelist had begun to receive enthusiastic critical attention. MacShane presented him as a major writer who \"rose from the blank anonymity of America\". Overcoming a \"tortured and lonely life,\" Chandler became a writer whose vision of America has grown in persuasive power. The Life Of Raymond Chandler was MacShane's book most likely to endure. His plea to take the life and perceptions of O'Hara seriously was a harder sell. By praising O'Hara's precinct cop who picks up a phone and asks \"Wukkan I do fya?\" MacShane put his finger on what was least authentic in the writer's documentation of American life. MacShane taught at Williams College from 1965-67, then went to Columbia University. There he founded the graduate writing division and taught creative writing. He published translations of Miguel Serrano, co-edited Borges On Writing, and edited two volumes of American travel writing. He remained an enthusiastic and dedicated teacher until Alzheimer's disease ended his academic career in 1992. He is survived by his son Nicholas. \u0095 Frank MacShane, biographer, born October 19 1927; died November 15 1999",

On top of that, there's all the other disadvantages of EMU such as the euro economies' bankrupt pensions systems.\" </p> <p>Simon Buckby, campaign director of Britain in Europe, said: \"This survey demonstrates that the single currency is already having an effect on price levels in the euro-zone. That is good news for consumers. Falling prices are one of the major potential benefits of joining a successful single currency.\"</p>",

Although the government is sticking by its \"prepare and decide\" strategy, new evidence of the costs of conversion will strengthen the hand of those cabinet ministers - led by the chancellor, Gordon Brown - who are arguing for a low-key approach to the issue in the run-up to the election. Although KPMG stressed that there could be long-term benefits from monetary union for consumers and companies, the findings are likely to discomfort Mr Byers, who has cited pressure from big business as a reason for the government to be more upbeat about the euro. Mr Byers recently stretched the government's cautious stance on euro - that a referendum will only be held once a series of economic conditions have been met - by saying that foreign investors, especially those from Japan, are eager for Britain to sign up. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, has also adopted a more aggressive pro-euro stance in recent months, arguing that Britain risks being isolated in Europe unless it makes its mind up on EMU membership quickly. Mr Brown wants Labour's election campaign to focus on his successful management of the economy and on bread and butter policies such as the working families tax credit. Francis Maude, the shadow chancellor, said: \"These figures are an embarrassment to the government which is determined to conduct the debate on the euro without ever publishing a figure for what it would actually cost British business and the taxpayer. With polls showing the public becoming increasingly opposed to joining the single currency, the government should scrap their national changeover plan which was launched last year before a single vote has been cast in a referendum.\" Nick Herbert, chief executive of Business for Sterling, the anti-euro lobby group, said: \"The simple costs of changing to the euro are astronomical and rising. On top of that, there's all the other disadvantages of EMU such as the euro economies' bankrupt pensions systems.\" Simon Buckby, campaign director of Britain in Europe, said: \"This survey demonstrates that the single currency is already having an effect on price levels in the euro-zone. That is good news for consumers. Falling prices are one of the major potential benefits of joining a successful single currency.\"",

      "body": "<p>It is the multi-billion dollar question that Bill Gates, Paul Allen, Jim Clark, Michael Dell and the growing bank of super-rich e-entrepreneurs are trying to answer. What, when you have bought every holiday home, car, yacht and private jet that you could ever possibly want, do you do with the billions of dollars in change you still have lying around? Increasingly the answer is: give it away. </p> <p>Do a little bit for charity, something for mankind. Go down in history as something more than a brilliantly successful techno-geek. The race to give it away dot.com style has started, prompting one of the heaviest periods of charitable giving in history. \"These guys are a new breed of businessmen who are giving away more money and at a younger age than the Carnegies and Rockefellers of generations before,\" said Stacy Palmer, editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy in Washington DC. \"This is just the beginning of what could be an extraordinary period of giving.\" </p> <p><strong> Endowed</strong><br> </p> <p> Mr Gates has already said that he plans to give almost all of his $100bn (\u00a362bn) fortune away and when earlier this week he and his wife Melinda gave a further $5bn to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, it surpassed Britain's Wellcome Trust as the most impressively-endowed foundation in the world. </p> <p>The $21.8bn Mr Gates' foundation has at its disposal dwarfs those of any other new-technology philanthropists but the donations his colleagues and rivals have made are far from insignificant. Education, health and technological development are usually the causes of choice. </p> <p>Netscape's Jim Clark recently gave Stanford University a cheque for $150m, Jim Barksdale - the man Mr Clark brought in to run Netscape - has pledged $100m to a literacy programme at the University of Mississippi. Mr Dell and his wife Sue have put aside $114m in Dell stock to promote arts and innovation in Central Texas plus children's health and education around the world. </p> <p>Tim Gill, founder of Quark software, plans to give away his $1.1bn fortune. Most of it will go to helping gay and lesbian causes, he said. </p> <p>Mr Gates' foundation, which is managed by his father, has spread its funds widely. In August it teamed up with media mogul Ted Turner to donate $78m towards a United Nations-World Health Organisation initiative to eradicate polio. </p> <p><strong> Vaccines</strong><br> </p> <p> It has since committed $50m to the prevention of cervical cancer and $750m to a global children's vaccination programme. </p> <p>\"The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation will continue to focus on helping to improve people's lives, primarily through health and learning,\" said Patty Stonesifer, the foundation's co-chair. </p> <p>\"Particular attention will go towards accelerating the development and distribution of life-saving vaccines. Other major efforts include extending unprecedented opportunities for learning by bringing computers with Internet access to every eligible public library in the US and Canada, and providing scholarships to academically talented minority students with severe financial need through the Gates Millennium Scholars Program.\" </p> <p>Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, has six charitable foundations whose interests range from music to biotechnology. Investments include a national museum for rock 'n' roll in Seattle, numerous grants to protect local forests and rivers, and an Aids prevention charity in Los Angeles. </p> <p>He has also bought his local NFL football team and the NBA basketball franchise for a combined fee of around $500m. \"If people remembered me as someone who had fun working with people to develop new technologies, who tried to do positive things for the community, I would be satisfied,\" Mr Allen told reporters. </p> <p>The Dells' spokeswoman, Tricia Knox, said their latest $100m donation was prompted by the couple's desire to \"extend the charitable giving they have done in the past, and the foundation is a vehicle for them to do that a little bit further.\" </p> <p>For cash-starved charities, health care projects and welfare initiatives in the United States - which lacks a European-style, government-funded welfare safety net - the private philanthropy is manna from heaven. However, some causes have failed to register in the radar. \"President Clinton called a conference at the White House recently to tell hi-tech philanthropists to direct more of their resources towards the poor and needy homelessness and foodbanks,\" Ms Palmer said. </p> <p>But some commentators suggest the \"helping others\" mantra many of the internet-rich preach is actually a cover for a \"help thyself\" approach. Mr Gates has been subjected to the most sniping. Many American columnists have questioned whether the recent acceleration in his charitable donations has anything to do with the pending judicial decision on the government filed anti-competition suit that Microsoft is fighting. They conclude, of course, that there is no connection.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is the multi-billion dollar question that Bill Gates, Paul Allen, Jim Clark, Michael Dell and the growing bank of super-rich e-entrepreneurs are trying to answer. What, when you have bought every holiday home, car, yacht and private jet that you could ever possibly want, do you do with the billions of dollars in change you still have lying around? Increasingly the answer is: give it away. Do a little bit for charity, something for mankind. Go down in history as something more than a brilliantly successful techno-geek. The race to give it away dot.com style has started, prompting one of the heaviest periods of charitable giving in history. \"These guys are a new breed of businessmen who are giving away more money and at a younger age than the Carnegies and Rockefellers of generations before,\" said Stacy Palmer, editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy in Washington DC. \"This is just the beginning of what could be an extraordinary period of giving.\" Endowed Mr Gates has already said that he plans to give almost all of his $100bn (\u00a362bn) fortune away and when earlier this week he and his wife Melinda gave a further $5bn to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, it surpassed Britain's Wellcome Trust as the most impressively-endowed foundation in the world. The $21.8bn Mr Gates' foundation has at its disposal dwarfs those of any other new-technology philanthropists but the donations his colleagues and rivals have made are far from insignificant. Education, health and technological development are usually the causes of choice. Netscape's Jim Clark recently gave Stanford University a cheque for $150m, Jim Barksdale - the man Mr Clark brought in to run Netscape - has pledged $100m to a literacy programme at the University of Mississippi. Mr Dell and his wife Sue have put aside $114m in Dell stock to promote arts and innovation in Central Texas plus children's health and education around the world. Tim Gill, founder of Quark software, plans to give away his $1.1bn fortune. Most of it will go to helping gay and lesbian causes, he said. Mr Gates' foundation, which is managed by his father, has spread its funds widely. In August it teamed up with media mogul Ted Turner to donate $78m towards a United Nations-World Health Organisation initiative to eradicate polio. Vaccines It has since committed $50m to the prevention of cervical cancer and $750m to a global children's vaccination programme. \"The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation will continue to focus on helping to improve people's lives, primarily through health and learning,\" said Patty Stonesifer, the foundation's co-chair. \"Particular attention will go towards accelerating the development and distribution of life-saving vaccines. Other major efforts include extending unprecedented opportunities for learning by bringing computers with Internet access to every eligible public library in the US and Canada, and providing scholarships to academically talented minority students with severe financial need through the Gates Millennium Scholars Program.\" Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, has six charitable foundations whose interests range from music to biotechnology. Investments include a national museum for rock 'n' roll in Seattle, numerous grants to protect local forests and rivers, and an Aids prevention charity in Los Angeles. He has also bought his local NFL football team and the NBA basketball franchise for a combined fee of around $500m. \"If people remembered me as someone who had fun working with people to develop new technologies, who tried to do positive things for the community, I would be satisfied,\" Mr Allen told reporters. The Dells' spokeswoman, Tricia Knox, said their latest $100m donation was prompted by the couple's desire to \"extend the charitable giving they have done in the past, and the foundation is a vehicle for them to do that a little bit further.\" For cash-starved charities, health care projects and welfare initiatives in the United States - which lacks a European-style, government-funded welfare safety net - the private philanthropy is manna from heaven. However, some causes have failed to register in the radar. \"President Clinton called a conference at the White House recently to tell hi-tech philanthropists to direct more of their resources towards the poor and needy homelessness and foodbanks,\" Ms Palmer said. But some commentators suggest the \"helping others\" mantra many of the internet-rich preach is actually a cover for a \"help thyself\" approach. Mr Gates has been subjected to the most sniping. Many American columnists have questioned whether the recent acceleration in his charitable donations has anything to do with the pending judicial decision on the government filed anti-competition suit that Microsoft is fighting. They conclude, of course, that there is no connection.",

Their son, Dylan, now three, is being looked after by family, friends and nannies at a cost so far of \u00a325,000. Kerstin is now at a rehabilitation unit in Godalming, Surrey, the court heard. The hearing continues.",

Confidential papers to be put before the National Trust's council meeting show it will be asked to look again at the scientific controversy over whether stag hunting is cruel. The scientific row is between Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior - a member of Lord Burns's team - and Patrick Bateson, provost of King's college, Cambridge, whose original research led to the ban on stag hunting in 1998. The appointment of Lord Soulsby, a vet who is an expert on parasites in domestic animals, to Lord Burns's inquiry into how to implement the hunting ban and what effect it will have on the rural economy has already attracted criticism from anti-hunting groups because of the evidence he gave to the National Trust saying deer hunting was not cruel. Today he will be backed by Roger Harris, who, in a report commissioned by the Countryside Alliance, has argued that Lord Soulsby's analysis is right and that it is not a cruel activity. But 12 scientists have submitted evidence backing Professor Bateson and attacking the analysis submitted by Pro fessor Harris. There is no dispute over the evidence or data used by either camp, and the row is over interpretation of the evidence. Scientists backing Prof Bateson include John Krebs, best known for heading the government-funded study into badgers and TB, and one of Britain's foremost zoologists, Sir Richard Southwood. All of them stress that the joint universities study by Prof Harris, which the hunters claimed invalidated much of Prof Bateson's research, did in fact mirror many of his scientific findings as to levels of stress and muscle damage caused to animals as they are chased for miles.

This is a legitimate subject for Panorama to tackle but one which is completely overshadowed in Phillips' eyes by our reporting of the fact that new academic research shows a negative relationship between mothers working in the pre-school years and academic qualifications later on.</p> <p>Phillips may not like it, but this is a significant finding and one that both we and the academics responsible for the research agreed should be broadcast. No one wants to make working mothers like Phillips, or me, feel guilty but, as a current affairs programme, it is our job to ensure that important information that has wide currency in the academic world and is relevant to the lives of many families is shared with our audience.</p> <p>And, contrary to the impression left by Dr Tony Munton (Letters, January 26), Panorama did not ignore important new research that somehow contradicted the evidence on child outcomes presented in the programme. Dr Munton mentions American research from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. But he conveniently forgets to mention that the most recent evidence from this study finds that \"more hours of childcare predicted less maternal sensitivity and less positive child engagement\".</p> <p>This finding is entirely in keeping with the research from the Institute of Education, as explained on Panorama.</p> <p>Is Dr Munton's reluctance to engage seriously with the most significant piece of British research on child outcomes to date, which has been carried out by a highly respected academic and is based on a huge data set of 9,000 children, simply a sign that this area of research is, for some, too hot to handle? <br><b>Sarah Powell</b> <br>Panorama</p> <p>\u0095 Two or three years ago I asked my employer about setting up a creche or subsidising local childcare provision and holiday play schemes. I was told we didn't have enough women employees to justify this kind of thing. A high proportion of my colleagues were men with pre-school and primary-school-aged children; many had partners who had returned to work and a fair few had \"non-traditional\" family arrangements. As long as childcare is seen as a girl-thing I don't know how we make progress on the kind of issues that Panorama raised. <br><b> David Hopson</b> <br>West Wittering, W Sussex</p> <p>\u0095 Both women and men should be able to combine work and family, without either suffering. Children will thrive if their parents have found the right balance. The government should now put legislative teeth into its much vaunted commitment to family friendly policies. The draft regulations on part-time work could easily be amended to create a right to work part-time or job-share that we can all understand and use. <br><b>Camilla Palmer</b> <br>Bindman &amp; Partners</p> <p>\u0095 When mothers decide to give up full-time employment they are making themselves extremely vulnerable. When my marriage broke up I had not worked for nine years and was left in my 40s with two children at primary school. I was extremely fortunate in having professional qualifications and obtaining a full-time job with my previous employer, but even so my career prospects were irretrievably damaged and my occupational pension will be modest. Most women in my situation will not be so lucky. <br><b> Joan Griffith</b> <br>Windsor, Berks</p>",

No one wants to make working mothers like Phillips, or me, feel guilty but, as a current affairs programme, it is our job to ensure that important information that has wide currency in the academic world and is relevant to the lives of many families is shared with our audience. And, contrary to the impression left by Dr Tony Munton (Letters, January 26), Panorama did not ignore important new research that somehow contradicted the evidence on child outcomes presented in the programme. Dr Munton mentions American research from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. But he conveniently forgets to mention that the most recent evidence from this study finds that \"more hours of childcare predicted less maternal sensitivity and less positive child engagement\". This finding is entirely in keeping with the research from the Institute of Education, as explained on Panorama. Is Dr Munton's reluctance to engage seriously with the most significant piece of British research on child outcomes to date, which has been carried out by a highly respected academic and is based on a huge data set of 9,000 children, simply a sign that this area of research is, for some, too hot to handle? Sarah Powell Panorama \u0095 Two or three years ago I asked my employer about setting up a creche or subsidising local childcare provision and holiday play schemes. I was told we didn't have enough women employees to justify this kind of thing. A high proportion of my colleagues were men with pre-school and primary-school-aged children; many had partners who had returned to work and a fair few had \"non-traditional\" family arrangements. As long as childcare is seen as a girl-thing I don't know how we make progress on the kind of issues that Panorama raised. David Hopson West Wittering, W Sussex \u0095 Both women and men should be able to combine work and family, without either suffering. Children will thrive if their parents have found the right balance. The government should now put legislative teeth into its much vaunted commitment to family friendly policies. The draft regulations on part-time work could easily be amended to create a right to work part-time or job-share that we can all understand and use. Camilla Palmer Bindman &amp; Partners \u0095 When mothers decide to give up full-time employment they are making themselves extremely vulnerable. When my marriage broke up I had not worked for nine years and was left in my 40s with two children at primary school. I was extremely fortunate in having professional qualifications and obtaining a full-time job with my previous employer, but even so my career prospects were irretrievably damaged and my occupational pension will be modest. Most women in my situation will not be so lucky. Joan Griffith Windsor, Berks",

      "bodyText": "Romano Prodi and the European commission threw down a new challenge to Tony Blair and other EU leaders yesterday, by insisting that national vetoes must be reduced. In an approach that set alarm bells ringing in Britain, the commission president said tax matters linked to the cross-border single market should be decided by majority vote rather than unanimity. This could include the unresolved issue of the proposed withholding of tax on savings - on which the chancellor Gordon Brown is at odds with most EU partners in defence of the City of London's lucrative Eurobond market. Mr Prodi also returned to the old idea of a two-speed Europe in which some countries could integrate faster than others, leaving Britain - already looking increasingly unlikely to join the single currency - in the slow lane. Proposals to strip Britain and four other large countries of their right to an EU commissioner were angrily condemned by Conservative MEPs, who accused Labour colleagues of complicity in promoting a centralised European superstate. But the government, which wants only a modest reform agenda, reacted frostily to the long-trailed proposals. Britain has already said it would sacrifice one of its two commissioners - currently Neil Kinnock and Chris Patten - for the sake of reform. But one Prodi idea is for a rotation of commissioners to allow all member states to have a go. Mr Prodi's proposals for reform, to be discussed in a year-long intergovernmental conference (IGC) starting next month, are unlikely to be accepted, but his ambitious approach, backed by Portugal, the current holder of the rotating presidency, may influence future bargaining. Change is urgent because the EU, set up by six members in 1957, now has 15, and could in the next few years admit as many as 13 new members from eastern and southern Europe. This would make it virtually impossible to reach agreement under current arrangements. EU leaders decided at last month's summit in Finland that the reform agenda should be limited to avoid setting goals that cannot be achieved before enlargement starts in three years. Mr Prodi told the European parliament: \"We know from experience that unanimity already means either paralysis or reducing decisions to their lowest common denominator. \"At 27 or 28 members, there is no way round a radical approach. Qualified majority voting must be the general rule.\" Mr Prodi, the former Italian prime minister, made it clear he was not calling for the harmonisation of national tax systems, but the commissioner in charge of the IGC, Frenchman Michel Barnier, said: \"All subjects linked to the proper functioning of the single market should be open to qualified majority voting.\" John Maples, the shadow foreign secretary, said: \"The European commission has yet again let the tax harmonisation cat out of the bag, and has blown out of the water Tony Blair's claims that this year's IGC will not be far-reaching.\" Conservative spokesman Christopher Beazely MEP said: \"The commission should not present changes to qualified majority voting as a fait accompli, in particular for taxation matters.\"",

It's the same reason boy bands are popular with young girls - it's the hint of sex without having a penis\" Queer As Folk producer Nicky Schindler on why the series is so popular with women, Elle. \"It's not the leaving that women object to, it's the fact that it's always in one direction, which suggests it isn't always personality, mutual hobbies and love of children that has clinched the decision\" Shane Watson on why we all hate a man who leaves his wife for a younger woman, Evening Standard. \"Labour's 'whingeing wimminist' tendency are moaning and groaning again. The 'sisters' are worried because New Labour is likely to lose seats at the next election and many of those MPs most at risk of defeat are women. It is hard to think it will matter much ... There has been a palpable failure by them to speak out on issues which are the concerns of women generally. Much attention has been devoted to the Blair Babe lifestyle: clothes, babies, social life and - most common of all - how sexist the Commons is and what a hard time they have at work, poor dears. This whinger wing of Labour feminism should stop moaning. The truth is that there are not many other jobs which would allow them flexibility and long holidays, good pay, social status, travel and an agreeable working environment ... Labour's support among women voters is slipping. It could be won back by concentrating on issues such as proper NHS funding, but not by a moaning wimminist agenda\" Ann Carlton on how \"Blair's Babes have betrayed their own sex\", Daily Mail. \"The honeymoon Labour has enjoyed with women is coming to an end. Women have begun to note the abyss between Blair's poses and the reality of his government. They have seen that the people with real power are still men.

In spring 1999, around 24% of female and 15% of male full-time employees worked some form of flexible working pattern. We also work the longest hours in Europe at 45.7 hours for men and 40.7 hours for women. Income and wealth: men still earning more Men's incomes outstripped those of women at all ages in 1996-97, with men earning nearly twice that of women in their late forties peak earning period. In the 1990s the growth in average earnings outpaced the growth in retail prices and the inequality in the distribution of household disposable incomes that grew so sharply in the 1980s receded in the last decade. Environment: it's getting hotter In 1996-97, 51% of adults said they had regularly taken paper to a paper bank for recycling. Globally, seven out of the 10 hottest years on records have been in the 1990s.",

The treasury said rip-off home loans will become a thing of the past under its shake-up of the \u00a3115bn-a-year industry, which will see mortgages subjected to statutory regulation for the first time. With banks and building societies coming under fire in recent months for allegedly penalising customers with unfair terms and hidden charges, ministers unveiled rules which will give homebuyers legal protection against bad practices. But the reforms were attacked by consumer groups for failing to address the problem of poor quality and misleading advice given by salespeople.

      "bodyText": "Lawyers for the home secretary yesterday attacked the Belgian government over its claims that he had acted \"unlawfully and irrationally\" by not releasing the medical reports that found the former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, 84, was unfit to stand trial. On the first day of a high court hearing in which the Belgian authorities and human rights groups are seeking a judicial review of the procedures the home secretary has adopted in making the decision that he is \"minded\" to return the general to Chile, Jonathan Sumption QC, accused the Belgian government of launching a \"diatribe\" against Mr Straw in a letter to the home office. \"I must be careful what I say in this court about a friendly foreign government. \"But there are aspects of this letter of request that are surprising,\" he told a packed court two. \"This is either a collateral process to get confidential material [the medical reports] for use in the UK, or the Belgians have not thought it through.\" The extradition to Spain of General Pinochet to face charges of torture was becoming a \"symbol of a commitment to human rights\" rather than a legal matter which had to be properly weighed up. Rejecting claims of unfairness, he told Mr Justice Maurice Kay: \"In a difficult situation the secretary of state has got the balance exactly right and there is absolutely no basis in these applications for supposing his conclusion was perverse or in any other way unlawful.\" Earlier Presiley Baxendale QC, for the Belgian government, said that it was a \"breach of natural justice\" for Mr Straw not to disclose the medical reports. Without seeing the medical records - which Mr Straw has declined to disclose claiming they are covered by medical confidentiality rules - the Belgian government was unable to make meaningful representations. \"It was irrational because at one and the same time the secretary of state was asking Belgium to make representations and refusing to disclose the details of the report,\" she told the court. By halting extradition proceedings the home secretary was in danger of breaching international law and conventions under which signatories undertook to provide each other with the widest measure of \"mutual assurance\" in extradition proceedings . Richard Drabble QC, for Amnesty and other human rights groups, said their representations were mere \"shadow boxing\" without access to the medical reports. If Mr Straw did not have the power to force Pinochet to undergo further medical tests, he could use his discretion to push the general towards more medical tests or greater openness by threatening to continue the extradition proceedings and allowing the Spanish courts to rule on the matter. The suggestion was roundly rejected by Mr Sumption who insisted that the laws of the country invested the authority for sanctioning extradition with the home secretary. Faced with conclusive medical evidence Mr Straw was legally obliged to release a fugitive. He attacked the human rights groups for bringing the proceedings, claiming the campaigners had no legal right to be heard in extradition matters. Mr Straw had taken an \"exceptional step\" in allowing them the opportunity to make representations at all. The general had been examined by four highly eminent medical experts. While it was possible there was a factual error in the report, it was not a strong enough possibility to outweigh the duty of confidentiality owed to the former Chilean dictator. The hearing continues today.",

The Conservative treasury spokesman, David Heathcoat-Amory, tabled a Commons question, asking the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, to list all payments from his department to TransTec since 1991. Because the Tories believe ministers like Mr Mandelson have not been sufficiently sensitive to the risk of conflict of interest over Mr Robinson's complex affairs, they are pressing behind the scenes for a full examination of subsidies to TransTec in Northern Ireland, to be carried out by either the Northern Ireland Office or the devolved government in Belfast. Mr Blair's spokesman insisted yesterday that the multi-millionaire who helped fund Labour's pre-election campaigning was not a \"pariah.\" Interviewed last night, the prime minister himself was wary - not disowning Mr Robinson, but not being as fulsome as in previous skirmishes. \"There are allegations made about him.

      "bodyText": "An army brigadier has resigned over the government's decision to allow gays into the forces, citing his \"strongly held moral and military convictions\" as his reasons for wanting to leave. Brigadier Pat Lawless, 44, who joined the Army Air Corps in 1976, said he was \"very sad to leave\", but could not reconcile his beliefs with the government's actions. In a statement, following a report in the Sun, he said: \"On January 10 2000 I applied to leave the army on the grounds that I could not reconcile my strongly held moral and military convictions as a soldier and a citizen with the government's decision to lift the ban on homosexuals serving in the armed services.\" Brig Lawless, who is married with two children, was recently made deputy commander of the new tri-service joint helicopter command, based at Wilton, Wiltshire. A spokesman for the ministry of defence said last night: \"It is very much a personal matter for Brig Lawless, and we obviously respect that. As far as the policy change is concerned, it is something we were required to put through once the European Court [of Human Rights] ruled against our previous stance. Service chiefs have made it clear that they are committed to making the new policy work.\" The shadow defence secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, said: \"When next in government, the Conservatives remain committed to letting the armed forces review the policy and assess whether or not it works.\"",

The body makes new flesh and blood and bone to repair wounds. But severed neurons do not recover, so spinal injuries can put sufferers into wheelchairs for life, and many people never recover properly from strokes and other head wounds. But Frank Walsh of Smith-Kline Beecham in Harlow, Essex, Martin Schwab of the brain research institute in Geneva, and Stephen Strittmatter of Yale school of medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, report in separate papers in Nature today that they have found, in rats and humans, a gene called nogo which stops neurons from regrowing. Most researchers were con vinced there would be such a factor, and they were sure it would be found to do its work in myelin, the fatty sheath that protects nerves. The discovery opens up the tantalising possibility that there might be a way of bypassing the \"nogo\" factor. Dr Walsh said: \"Laboratory experiments have now suggested that injured neurons can restore themselves if certain inhibitory influences are removed.\" Damage to neurons in the brain or spinal cord leads to severe disability and death. But researchers have felt for years that the damage need not be permanent. In laboratory experiments, they have tested ways of stimulating regrowth in the nerves of damaged rats. Their suspicion has been that a protein produced in the myelin sheath blocks the process. They were right. They knew of a similar gene in cows, and combed the genetic databases for something very like it in humans and rats. They put the gene into cell cultures to make it produce the protein. \"We can thus assess the importance of nogo in growth inhibition relative to other natural inhibitors in the central nervous system,\" said Dr Walsh.

      "bodyText": "Labour MPs are expected to be told to back plans to repeal the controversial section 28 law on homosexuality, it emerged yesterday, following strong protests from backbenchers at hints that the government might allow a free vote. A day after Downing Street, attempting to defuse a growing row over the clause, indicated that MPs could be allowed to vote as they chose in deference to a handful of opponents, Tony Blair seemed to have bowed to pressure from an angry parliamentary party for a whipped vote. Protesters, including Ben Bradshaw, the gay MP for Exeter, and leftwinger Alice Mahon, spoke out at yesterday's meeting of the parliamentary party, making clear they wanted the government to resist a \"conscience vote\". Downing Street floated the option of a free vote on Tuesday. It followed a warning from Labour MP Stuart Bell, a church estates commissioner, that failure to allow MPs a conscience vote could lead to a rebellion in the Commons. But at yesterday's meeting, Mr Bradshaw told colleagues that there was anger among some Labour backbenchers when news of the possible strategy emerged. He warned that failure to make the issue a whipped vote would be a \"terrible tactical and moral mistake\". Following yesterday's parliamentary committee meeting with the prime minister, the PLP chairman, Clive Soley, said he was optimistic that Labour MPs would be whipped for the vote. He said: \"The decision on the section 28 vote hasn't been made yet, because it is a whipping decision which is always made closer to the vote. But I am optimistic it will be a whipped vote.\" Despite Mr Bell's claims, there is no doubt that Labour opposition to repealing clause 28 would have been minimal, just as the vast majority of the parliamentary party earlier backed a reduction in the gay age of consent to 16. However, Mr Bradshaw and others argue that the party should direct its MPs to support the measure as a symbolic gesture since Labour has consistently opposed the clause as a matter of policy. They also say that, while the age of consent is an issue of conscience dealing with the behaviour of individuals, section 28 is a matter of public policy, since its bar on the \"promotion\" of homsexuality in schools relates to the powers and freedoms of local authorities. William Hague, the Tory leader, writing in the Daily Mail after sustained pressure from the paper calling on him to speak out in defence of the clause, also argued the matter was a party issue. He emphasised that his MPs would face a whipped vote. \"A party such as ours that believes in small government, and further believes in free institutions such as marriage and the family, has a responsibility to take a party line.\" But Mr Blair insisted that repealing clause 28 was sensible. \"The reason for it is that many of the organisations that deal with children said to us that this law is inhibiting people and sometimes teachers from doing their jobs properly in explaining to children the facts of life.\"",

Four months later, Peruvian armed forces stormed the building and the terrorists, with the loss of one hostage and two soldiers.

John Cusack is a struggling writer given a Broadway spot by the Mob on condition his show stars gangster's moll Jennifer Tilly. But it's her bodyguard, Chazz Palminteri, who has the talent: he's as good with a pen as he is with a gun. A viciously funny attack on theatrical foibles, with Dianne Wiest (pictured) stealing the show and grabbing an Oscar as grand Broadway dame Helen Sinclair. </p> <p> \u0095 <strong> The Waterdance</strong> </p> <p>(Neal Jimenez, Michael Steinberg, 1992) </p> <p>11pm, FilmFour </p> <p>Co-director Jimenez also wrote this, from bitter experience after being paralysed for life by a fall.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Endgame 6pm, Discovery On December 13, 1996, 14 members of the Peruvian revolutionary group MRTA stormed a party at the Japanese ambassador's residence and took 72 hostages. Four months later, Peruvian armed forces stormed the building and the terrorists, with the loss of one hostage and two soldiers. This film examines the planning behind the assault, which involved building a tunnel under the compound and an exact replica of the house. What it doesn't consider is the political context - or indeed the possibility of a peaceful conclusion. \u0095 Bullets Over Broadway (Woody Allen, 1994) 9pm, UK Arena Witty Woody back in the roaring 20s, with a case of don't shoot me, I'm only the playwright. John Cusack is a struggling writer given a Broadway spot by the Mob on condition his show stars gangster's moll Jennifer Tilly. But it's her bodyguard, Chazz Palminteri, who has the talent: he's as good with a pen as he is with a gun. A viciously funny attack on theatrical foibles, with Dianne Wiest (pictured) stealing the show and grabbing an Oscar as grand Broadway dame Helen Sinclair. \u0095 The Waterdance (Neal Jimenez, Michael Steinberg, 1992) 11pm, FilmFour Co-director Jimenez also wrote this, from bitter experience after being paralysed for life by a fall. Playing him on screen, Eric Stoltz struggles to overcome bitterness and frustration with the help of fellow paraplegics in a rehabilitation ward. Helen Hunt is his married girlfriend, William Forsythe a racist biker and Wesley Snipes plays a sad dreamer. \u0095 The End Of Violence (Wim Wenders, 1997) 1.10am, Sky MovieMax One of Wenders's stylish and enthralling American sojourns. Bill Pullman's shlock movie producer goes into hiding with a Mexican family after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt. The plot drifts from the devious to downright muddled, but there are lots of plusses: an engaging, oddball collection of characters, including an armed and dangerous Andie MacDowell",

But perhaps what's gone is not lost forever. Recent advances in genetic technology and the emerging science of cloning suggest it may be possible to bring back the thylacine, raising from the dead, as it were, a creature consigned to history. At the Australian Museum in Sydney, director Michael Archer is heading a project to do just this. </p> <p>Until recently, Archer tells me by phone, the notion of species resurrection was viewed by most scientists as pure fantasy. \"I first mentioned the idea of bringing back the thylacine 10 years ago,\" he says. \"That was before Dolly, and everyone said it was impossible.\" But \"suddenly, with the new climate of genetics, its become possible - at least in thought.\" With a million dollars in funding from the New South Wales state government and private sponsorship from the Tasmanian-based Rheuben Griffiths Trust, the Museum is now putting together a team to begin the painstaking work necessary to realise this dream. </p> <p>The ultimate goal of the project, Archer says, will be to clone a thylacine using a process similar to that used to create Dolly the sheep. But since there are no living thylacines, huge technological hurdles will have to be overcome. Foremost is the challenge of recovering a complete set of thylacine DNA. In living animals the complete genome can be culled from the nucleus of most adult cells, but the famous spiral molecule degrades after death so the museum's researchers will have to extract DNA fragments from preserved tissue samples and hope that they can piece together a full set. </p> <p>Two months ago the museum held a workshop to discuss the technological aspects of DNA recovery, and says Archer, almost all the geneticists present thought it should be possible. The museum has an extremely well preserved thylacine specimen and work has already begun, with current efforts focusing on skin and muscle tissues. No one believes it is going to be easy, but \"with enough time it should be possible to recover the whole genome,\" Archer enthuses. In the meantime, DNA fragments will be replicated and stored inside bacteria or yeast. </p> <p>Even if a complete set of thylacine DNA is assembled, immense obstacles remain - the most daunting being the task of finding a suitable surrogate mother. Dolly's host mother was another sheep, but the first thylacine embryos will have to be grown to term inside females of another species. The most likely candidates are its closest living relatives, the numbat and the Tasmanian devil. </p> <p>When Dolly was cloned, the nucleic DNA (ie. the genome) of one sheep was inserted into an egg from another sheep, creating an embryonic hybrid of two different sheep. Since there are no thylacine females around the first cloned thylacines will have to be produced using eggs of another species, prob ably the chosen host species. If the numbat is chosen, recovered thylacine DNA would be inserted into a numbat egg, creating a hybridised embryo between two different species. Last year scientists at China's national academy of sciences transferred a cell nucleus from a giant panda into the egg of a Japanese white rabbit. Nobody knows if such hybrids will gestate, but the Chinese hope that within three years they will successfully clone a panda from such embryos. </p> <p>Genetically speaking, such hybridised creatures would not quite be full clones. Because mitochondrial DNA (that found in the cell cyto plasm outside the nucleus) is inherited from the egg only, they would retain some genetic traces of the alien species used to produce them. A thylacine cloned with a numbat egg would have numbat mitochondrial DNA in every one of its cells. Again, nobody knows what effect this might have . </p> <p>But well before Archer and his team get to that stage these technological issues should be much better understood. Around the world researchers involved in preservation of endangered species such as the panda and the bongo (a rare species of antelope) are exploring the possibilities of embryo hybridisation and interspecies surrogacy. At the Audubon centre for research of endangered species in New Orleans biologists have successfully implanted bongo embryos into eland antelopes, a close relative of the bongo. In China, it is hoped that panda embryos can eventually be implanted into black bears or sloth bears. </p> <p>If the technological hurdles are apparently being overcome, ethical questions remain. Is this something we should be doing? For Archer the answer is clear: \"I can't conceive of a more exciting thing to achieve in the next century than to bring back a species from extinction.\" </p> <p>Since it is humans who wiped out the thylacine in the first place, Archer believes that \"if we can redress that mistake then we should.\" If that sounds like playing god, Archer says it is not. \"That's what we did when we eliminated them.\" </p> <p>Some scientists see expensive cloning projects as financial sink holes that will suck money away from other conservation efforts such as preserving habitats and reinvigorating existing wild populations. Archer believes this criticism is unjustified because, as he tells me, the people who will put money into this won't put it into conservation in general: \"This excites them in a way that conservation does not.\" He believes it is not a matter of competition between the two endeavours, but that different people will support different kinds of projects. </p> <p>And what of the thylacines themselves? What sort of a life would they come back to? If we can do it for one individual, Archer says, then we should be able to bring back a whole population since there are plenty of well preserved specimens in Australian museums.

Mr Chalmers' departure comes only weeks after Mr Dewar's chief aide, John Rafferty, was also forced to resign.</p> <p>It is understood Mr Dewar was aware of both convictions - the last of which happened on January 7 - but did not ask for Mr Chalmers' resignation. Mike Russell, business manager for the Scottish National Party, said: \"Donald Dewar is reacting to events and appears to have lost all control over what is happening inside his backbiting executive.\" Late last year, Mr Rafferty was forced to resign after becoming embroiled in allegations that he lied to the Scottish press. But a feud between Mr Rafferty and the first minister's spokesman, David Whitton, was also said to have quickened his departure.</p> <p>When news of Mr Chalmers' resignation broke, Mr Whitton tried to lay blame for the scandal on Mr Rafferty. Mr Whitton has since apologised unreservedly for his remarks. But Mr Rafferty says he is considering legal action.</p> <p>Mr Chalmers was fined \u00a3400 in September last year for being drunk in charge of a stationary car. Earlier this month, he was convicted of a second drink-related motoring offence. A woman was in the car with Mr Chalmers when the September incident took place, but Mr Dewar's spokesman said: \"He denies that the woman was a prostitute.\"</p>",

Philip Chalmers, who ran Mr Dewar's strategic communications unit, resigned late on Tuesday evening after his second drink-related motoring conviction in four months. Mr Chalmers' departure comes only weeks after Mr Dewar's chief aide, John Rafferty, was also forced to resign. It is understood Mr Dewar was aware of both convictions - the last of which happened on January 7 - but did not ask for Mr Chalmers' resignation. Mike Russell, business manager for the Scottish National Party, said: \"Donald Dewar is reacting to events and appears to have lost all control over what is happening inside his backbiting executive.\" Late last year, Mr Rafferty was forced to resign after becoming embroiled in allegations that he lied to the Scottish press. But a feud between Mr Rafferty and the first minister's spokesman, David Whitton, was also said to have quickened his departure. When news of Mr Chalmers' resignation broke, Mr Whitton tried to lay blame for the scandal on Mr Rafferty. Mr Whitton has since apologised unreservedly for his remarks. But Mr Rafferty says he is considering legal action. Mr Chalmers was fined \u00a3400 in September last year for being drunk in charge of a stationary car. Earlier this month, he was convicted of a second drink-related motoring offence. A woman was in the car with Mr Chalmers when the September incident took place, but Mr Dewar's spokesman said: \"He denies that the woman was a prostitute.\"",

      "body": "<p>Spot the link between these two bits of news from Monday morning: music giant EMI announces it is to merge with Time Warner - itself recently merged with internet company AOL. Meanwhile, mobile phone operator BT Cellnet unveils its latest mobile phone range. </p> <p>Are these two different industries, travelling separate paths? Or two industries racing along roads which are set to cross very soon? The smart money - and the scale of these deals shows there's plenty about - is on those paths meeting. </p> <p>The mobile phone is a massive hit. In little more than a decade it has changed from a yuppy toy to a vital piece of kit for 40% of Britons, joining purses, wallets and keys as the thing you don't leave home without. </p> <p>But we have yet to see the mobile revolution really take a grip. Only five years from now, there will be a billion mobile phones in the world, making desktop computing seem a minority sport. </p> <p>\"We're at the beginning of the internet revolution,\" says Brian Greasley, general manager of BT Cellnet's mobile internet service provider, Genie Internet. He means that mobile phones, rather than the computers we've been using so far, are going to deliver that revolution. </p> <p>\"If you look at the internet today, it's based on a PC platform of 350m PCs worldwide. If you roll that figure forward to 2003, there will be around 400-500m PCs. Currently there's about 300m mobile phones, and by 2003 there will be one billion mobile phones. Every one of them will have an internet browser built in.\" </p> <p>Greasley is referring, at least in part, to new \"internet phones\". They send information using a new standard called Wireless Application Protocol (WAP). </p> <p>He is not even counting other devices, like Psion and Palm organisers, which already use mobile phones for communication and themselves have web access. They, and new generations of hybrid mobiles which combine organiser and phone, will mean we may still find our handsets much more useful than our computers. They'll not just be for talking - we'll use them to send messages, find out the latest news and football scores, access information and use services on the internet. </p> <p>And, here's the crunch, the amount of \"bandwidth\" these phones have - the amount of information they can receive or send in a second - will eclipse today's conventional telephone line connections to the net. This summer, you could have the equivalent of an expensive ISDN line to your mobile phone. In the near future, you will quite easily have the kind of power that will make receiving high quality sound and video on the move quite straightforward and rewarding, reshaping the way we get information and entertainment. And that's why content companies like EMI and Time Warner want to get friendly with internet giants like AOL. </p> <p>Before Monday's deal, EMI was already teaming up to provide entertainment over mobiles, including a deal with Genie Internet. Greasley says: \"With EMI, we'll be providing gossip lines and interviews, all based around SMS (short messaging) and audio. So, if you're a Spice Girls fan, you'll get an SMS message telling you Geri Halliwell has rejoined the band, and then if you hit the send button you can hear the interview and clips on the phone.\" </p> <p>It's not difficult to see where this kind of service will go when the more powerful networks and phones go on sale in the months and years to come. \"In the longer term,\" says Greasley, \"music will be delivered down the line, and there's quite a few integrated MP3 players being worked on by manufacturers. We believe the phone will become the next Walkman, and the Walkman was the biggest selling consumer electronics product ever.\" </p> <p>A lot of these services will be available sooner than you might expect. It is very cheap, compared to the costs of setting up a full web site, for a retailer or content provider to create a WAP site, so many big names have moved quickly to be ready from the off. Ian Germer, product strategy executive at Vodafone, says \"Things will be happening soon\". </p> <p>Quite how soon is a matter of some debate. Mobile operators expected working handsets to be on sale by last Christmas, but delivery dates slipped because of problems with the WAP software. It has been an inglorious start for a breakthrough technology: very few phones were around until last week. But Germer does not see the problems holding the technology back in the long run. </p> <p>\"We see that by next Christmas a significant proportion of handset sales will be WAP compatible. Once they've got over the hurdle, it'll be built into as many new handsets as possible - it'll become cheaper to do it that way.\" </p> <p>All eyes might be on WAP, but the concept of mobile data is nothing new. Companies with large, travelling workforces have long made use of it, while organisers and laptops computers can log on over mobile networks using PC card add-ons and specially equipped mobiles. But nobody is calling WAP mobile data because it is \"a real turn- off\", says Germer. \"WAP will take off because people don't realise this is mobile data; they'll be told they can get their share prices, or their bank balance, or do their shopping through their mobile, and think 'oh great.' It'll take off because there are things there that people want to do.\" </p> <p>Germer predicts that, as with the net, interaction between users and the applications they create themselves to put the technology to use will be the ones which catch most users' imaginations. </p> <p>\"The skill here is to get it to the point where the customers invent their own applications, and just get on with them. With WAP, you can see the time when children in the playground will be knocking up their own little WAP sites and showing them to their friends - there will be little playground competitions for the best, or rudest, WAP site around. </p> <p>\"People will develop little applications to help plumbers, or flower delivery companies. This is where electronic commerce is going to take off.\" </p> <p> Packaging and targeting the early WAP services will be important in making the technology popular, says Ben Wood of Lucent, a company which installs mobile networks and advises their operators. \"If you get people used to the habit of looking at their phones and interacting, you'll be in a better position when GPRS (General Packet Radio Service - a new, more powerful kind of mobile network) and WAP come along. \"There's no way you can just turn on a broadband network and say 'OK, we're open for business - come and start using it to gamble, playing games, using it to read news and information'.' </p> <p>The hunt is also on for \"killer apps\" - the applications which are so useful to an individual they feel a new mobile phone is a must have. \"There's a lot of talk about the killer application,\" says Wood, \"but the idea should be for every user to have one. If you go round a room you will find everyone's different - for me, since I like horse racing, it might be gambling that's my killer application. For you it might be news, for someone else the formula one latest. If you can deliver that - the most compelling information for them - it will be very important.\" And, he adds, the service has to be absolutely right, first time. Get any part of the complicated equation - breadth of content, partner shops and content providers, ease of use - and users may be put off. </p> <p>\"Bill shock\" - where users experiment with new information services and get landed with a huge bill - is also a big no no. </p> <p>The young are also very important, he says. \"There was some research recently which said 300,000 kids got mobiles for Christmas in the UK. The mobile phone was the most requested present for 12-15 year olds. That's staggering,' says Wood. </p> <p>\"They will have an insatiable desire for information. When they get one of these new phones, these are the people who'll be jumping onto it. For years, everyone's been banging on at WAP conferences about providing share prices and email. Those services will have their place, but they're not the applications for people like me.\" </p> <p>Schoolchildren might be at home with all this mobile pop news, but what about the rest of us? Will we not be a bit intimidated by the arrival of so much computing power in devices which, until now, we've just talked through? Genie Internet's Brian Greasley reckons that any problems will be overcome. </p> <p>\"I'd point to two things. One is SMS: up until last year people didn't know what SMS was. We as a network in December '98 did 6m messages a month. In January this year we did 62m messages. We have half a million people on Genie doing all this stuff, and we're growing at about 3000 a day. </p> <p>\"Look to the emerging mobile sectors like youth. Youth don't even know what technology is. Nobody has told my son how to work his GameBoy. He just uses it. It's exactly the same in this market. The early Nintendo and PlayStation market is now around 30, so there is a tremendous amount of people who are ready for this.\" </p> <p><strong>Where mobiles have been, are now, and will be soon</strong></p> <p> The first generation mobile phones were almost as unloved as their flashy yuppy owners: vast kits, more often installed in cars than carried. </p> <p>They were expensive to buy, prohibitively expensive to run, and because they were based on an analogue system (rather like two-way radio) reception faded in and out. The handsets became smaller and could be fitted into a large pocket, and tariffs fell to more reasonable levels, but they were still out of the reach of most people. </p> <p>In the early 90s, along came the second generation of phone - lighter and smaller digital handsets, with sim cards (credit-card size or smaller bits of plastic, with embedded microchips). Better call quality and much more attractive pricing from the networks, Vodafone and Cellnet, set us on the road to mass popularity. </p> <p>Prepaid mobiles revolutionised the business: all four networks offer them alongside their contract offerings. Virgin mobile doesn't offer its own network (it resells One2One services) but broadens the choices and offers intriguing possibilities should Virgin's other arms - including music and travel - be brought into play on its mobile service. </p> <p>Over the next few months we'll see generation two and-a-half: phones equipped with slightly bigger screens and Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) software. This mobile internet will offer cut down, highly practical versions of e-commerce and information websites, converted to run on the slower speeds and smaller screens of mobile phones. </p> <p>That limitation will not be around for long. This summer Britain gets its first high bandwidth mobile service, courtesy of BT Cellnet, which will offer capacity similar to an ISDN land line. Higher capacity will allow music and video to be downloaded quickly and at reasonably high quality, making multimedia entertainment via your mobile a practicality. Expect combined MP3 players and phones by Christmas. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Britain's Radiocommunications Agency closed the auction for the third generation of mobiles, run on a system called UMTS. </p> <p>This system will give immensely fast connections to mobiles - up to two megabytes of data a second. That kind of power could complete the mobile revolution.</p>",

He means that mobile phones, rather than the computers we've been using so far, are going to deliver that revolution. \"If you look at the internet today, it's based on a PC platform of 350m PCs worldwide. If you roll that figure forward to 2003, there will be around 400-500m PCs. Currently there's about 300m mobile phones, and by 2003 there will be one billion mobile phones. Every one of them will have an internet browser built in.\" Greasley is referring, at least in part, to new \"internet phones\". They send information using a new standard called Wireless Application Protocol (WAP). He is not even counting other devices, like Psion and Palm organisers, which already use mobile phones for communication and themselves have web access. They, and new generations of hybrid mobiles which combine organiser and phone, will mean we may still find our handsets much more useful than our computers. They'll not just be for talking - we'll use them to send messages, find out the latest news and football scores, access information and use services on the internet. And, here's the crunch, the amount of \"bandwidth\" these phones have - the amount of information they can receive or send in a second - will eclipse today's conventional telephone line connections to the net. This summer, you could have the equivalent of an expensive ISDN line to your mobile phone. In the near future, you will quite easily have the kind of power that will make receiving high quality sound and video on the move quite straightforward and rewarding, reshaping the way we get information and entertainment. And that's why content companies like EMI and Time Warner want to get friendly with internet giants like AOL. Before Monday's deal, EMI was already teaming up to provide entertainment over mobiles, including a deal with Genie Internet. Greasley says: \"With EMI, we'll be providing gossip lines and interviews, all based around SMS (short messaging) and audio. So, if you're a Spice Girls fan, you'll get an SMS message telling you Geri Halliwell has rejoined the band, and then if you hit the send button you can hear the interview and clips on the phone.\" It's not difficult to see where this kind of service will go when the more powerful networks and phones go on sale in the months and years to come. \"In the longer term,\" says Greasley, \"music will be delivered down the line, and there's quite a few integrated MP3 players being worked on by manufacturers. We believe the phone will become the next Walkman, and the Walkman was the biggest selling consumer electronics product ever.\" A lot of these services will be available sooner than you might expect. It is very cheap, compared to the costs of setting up a full web site, for a retailer or content provider to create a WAP site, so many big names have moved quickly to be ready from the off. Ian Germer, product strategy executive at Vodafone, says \"Things will be happening soon\". Quite how soon is a matter of some debate. Mobile operators expected working handsets to be on sale by last Christmas, but delivery dates slipped because of problems with the WAP software. It has been an inglorious start for a breakthrough technology: very few phones were around until last week. But Germer does not see the problems holding the technology back in the long run. \"We see that by next Christmas a significant proportion of handset sales will be WAP compatible. Once they've got over the hurdle, it'll be built into as many new handsets as possible - it'll become cheaper to do it that way.\" All eyes might be on WAP, but the concept of mobile data is nothing new. Companies with large, travelling workforces have long made use of it, while organisers and laptops computers can log on over mobile networks using PC card add-ons and specially equipped mobiles. But nobody is calling WAP mobile data because it is \"a real turn- off\", says Germer. \"WAP will take off because people don't realise this is mobile data; they'll be told they can get their share prices, or their bank balance, or do their shopping through their mobile, and think 'oh great.' It'll take off because there are things there that people want to do.\" Germer predicts that, as with the net, interaction between users and the applications they create themselves to put the technology to use will be the ones which catch most users' imaginations. \"The skill here is to get it to the point where the customers invent their own applications, and just get on with them. With WAP, you can see the time when children in the playground will be knocking up their own little WAP sites and showing them to their friends - there will be little playground competitions for the best, or rudest, WAP site around. \"People will develop little applications to help plumbers, or flower delivery companies. This is where electronic commerce is going to take off.\" Packaging and targeting the early WAP services will be important in making the technology popular, says Ben Wood of Lucent, a company which installs mobile networks and advises their operators. \"If you get people used to the habit of looking at their phones and interacting, you'll be in a better position when GPRS (General Packet Radio Service - a new, more powerful kind of mobile network) and WAP come along. \"There's no way you can just turn on a broadband network and say 'OK, we're open for business - come and start using it to gamble, playing games, using it to read news and information'.' The hunt is also on for \"killer apps\" - the applications which are so useful to an individual they feel a new mobile phone is a must have. \"There's a lot of talk about the killer application,\" says Wood, \"but the idea should be for every user to have one. If you go round a room you will find everyone's different - for me, since I like horse racing, it might be gambling that's my killer application. For you it might be news, for someone else the formula one latest. If you can deliver that - the most compelling information for them - it will be very important.\" And, he adds, the service has to be absolutely right, first time. Get any part of the complicated equation - breadth of content, partner shops and content providers, ease of use - and users may be put off. \"Bill shock\" - where users experiment with new information services and get landed with a huge bill - is also a big no no. The young are also very important, he says. \"There was some research recently which said 300,000 kids got mobiles for Christmas in the UK. The mobile phone was the most requested present for 12-15 year olds. That's staggering,' says Wood. \"They will have an insatiable desire for information. When they get one of these new phones, these are the people who'll be jumping onto it. For years, everyone's been banging on at WAP conferences about providing share prices and email. Those services will have their place, but they're not the applications for people like me.\" Schoolchildren might be at home with all this mobile pop news, but what about the rest of us? Will we not be a bit intimidated by the arrival of so much computing power in devices which, until now, we've just talked through? Genie Internet's Brian Greasley reckons that any problems will be overcome. \"I'd point to two things. One is SMS: up until last year people didn't know what SMS was. We as a network in December '98 did 6m messages a month. In January this year we did 62m messages. We have half a million people on Genie doing all this stuff, and we're growing at about 3000 a day. \"Look to the emerging mobile sectors like youth. Youth don't even know what technology is. Nobody has told my son how to work his GameBoy. He just uses it. It's exactly the same in this market. The early Nintendo and PlayStation market is now around 30, so there is a tremendous amount of people who are ready for this.\" Where mobiles have been, are now, and will be soon The first generation mobile phones were almost as unloved as their flashy yuppy owners: vast kits, more often installed in cars than carried. They were expensive to buy, prohibitively expensive to run, and because they were based on an analogue system (rather like two-way radio) reception faded in and out. The handsets became smaller and could be fitted into a large pocket, and tariffs fell to more reasonable levels, but they were still out of the reach of most people. In the early 90s, along came the second generation of phone - lighter and smaller digital handsets, with sim cards (credit-card size or smaller bits of plastic, with embedded microchips). Better call quality and much more attractive pricing from the networks, Vodafone and Cellnet, set us on the road to mass popularity. Prepaid mobiles revolutionised the business: all four networks offer them alongside their contract offerings. Virgin mobile doesn't offer its own network (it resells One2One services) but broadens the choices and offers intriguing possibilities should Virgin's other arms - including music and travel - be brought into play on its mobile service. Over the next few months we'll see generation two and-a-half: phones equipped with slightly bigger screens and Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) software. This mobile internet will offer cut down, highly practical versions of e-commerce and information websites, converted to run on the slower speeds and smaller screens of mobile phones. That limitation will not be around for long. This summer Britain gets its first high bandwidth mobile service, courtesy of BT Cellnet, which will offer capacity similar to an ISDN land line. Higher capacity will allow music and video to be downloaded quickly and at reasonably high quality, making multimedia entertainment via your mobile a practicality. Expect combined MP3 players and phones by Christmas. Earlier this month, Britain's Radiocommunications Agency closed the auction for the third generation of mobiles, run on a system called UMTS. This system will give immensely fast connections to mobiles - up to two megabytes of data a second. That kind of power could complete the mobile revolution.",

      "body": "<p>Setting up a website needn't cost the earth. I wanted an internet presence for my new company, which provides content for sites, but there was no way I could afford professional help. So I decided to do it myself - and I discovered that it is much easier than it looks. </p> <p>Firstly, I needed a website-authoring program, ideally one easy to use and free. Various companies offer shareware software, but these often require knowledge of HTML, the net's background language. </p> <p>I discovered I could download a free 30-day trial of Dreamweaver from <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com\">Macromedia</a>. This comes with a useful series of tutorials that taught me the basics. </p> <p>Dreamweaver is simple, but powerful. The first step is to create a folder on your hard drive for the site to live in. It is important that every file, from pages to images, is kept in this folder. Then, using Dreamweaver, go to the site menu and create a new site, with this new folder as its location. </p> <p>I knew that I wanted to use frames to divide the page so that graphics did not have to reload every time visitors looked at new pages. Dreamweaver provided a tutorial on frames, a number of templates and a palette to personalise them. </p> <p>After creating the frames, it was just a matter of typing in the information and applying styles to change text colours and size, not much different from PowerPoint or any word processor. Dreamweaver provided various templates for this, too. </p> <p>It is important to save the master page, the one with the frames in it, as index.html because that is what web browsers, such as Microsoft Explorer, look for when they first visit a site. </p> <p>I had a logo already and, was able to open it up and alter the resolution and resave it in the right format. For the net, you should save photos, logos and so on as gif files; resolution should be 72dpi and the size should be exactly that which it will be used at. The smaller the better is a good rule. </p> <p>Next, I had to get the logo on to the page; again, this was easy enough. </p> <p>I wanted to use one of the frames as an index with links to other information. Even this was simple. First, create the pages you will link to and put text in them, even if it is not the real content. In the index frame, type the titles. Select each one individually and use the properties palette to turn it into a link - it's just a matter of typing in the name of the file or clicking on the folder icon to select it from the menu. </p> <p>The only trick here is the target - which frame you want the new information to appear in. My main information frame is called main.html, so in a field called target I just typed main.html. Before I realised this, I got really frustrated because I couldn't work out why the new information kept appearing in the index frame. </p> <p>Later, I was able to update this to be a graphic with the pages listed on it. I used the image-mapping tool to create the links. </p> <p>I also wanted to create a \"contact me\" page, but didn't want to have to bother with complicated scripts that let people type straight into the internet browser page. So I cheated. I typed in my name, highlighted the text then selected E-mail Link on the objects menu. A popup window turned it into a link that opens your email program and enters the right address. </p> <p>After much trial and error, I had the site in a shape where it wouldn't discredit the company. Then I had to get it on the net. I needed an address for it, and that means getting a domain name. </p> <p>It was important to us that it was a name for which we could have not only the .co.uk address, but also .com, which is better for the rest of the world. I used a site called <a href=\"http://www.register.com\" target=\"_new\">register.com</a> to buy <a href=\"http://www.contentgenerators.com\" target=\"_new\">contentgenerators.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.contentgenerators.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">contentgenerators.co.uk</a>. The .com cost $70 for two years and the .co.uk \u00a349 for two years. These are standard costs. </p> <p> After looking around, I decided to use a company called <a href=\"http://www.icom.com\" target=\"_new\">Icom.com</a> to host the site. It is based in the United States, but on the web, this makes no difference. It's also cheap - a set up fee of $49 then just $8.95 a month for 45MB of space (trust me, more than you will ever need for a small business), unlimited traffic, email accounts and a domain name. Your internet service provider can give you web space, but if it is free or cheap it will be under their umbrella domain name, such as www.mybusiness.online.net, which can look unprofessional. </p> <p>Next you have to get your site on to the internet. Again, this was relatively simple using Dreamweaver. Icom sent me an email with all the details I needed to enter into Dreamweaver's site set up window and then I clicked \"connect\" and moved the entire sites into the public_html folder using the built in FTP (file transfer protocol) software. Many other programs, such as Fetch or Anarchie, are available to download for free - but they are a bit more complicated. </p> <p>Finally, email. Any messages sent to a name followed by @contentgenerators.com will get to me. All I had to do was set up a new account in my email program (under the preferences file, normally) using the details Icom.com had given me. </p> <p>I thought it was just a matter of waiting. Wrong. If you build it, they won't necessarily come. In the first few days, no one came. </p> <p>Then I discovered sites such as <a href=\"http://www.submitit.com\" target=\"_new\">Submitit.com</a>, which gave me a free trial. It checked my site for efficiency, broken links and so on and then, with my help, submitted it to a whole variety of search engines. </p> <p>My business partner, who knows a lot about these things, wrote the meta tags for our site. These should go at the top of the index page. Although they don't appear on the page, meta tags are what the search engines look for when they catalogue your page. </p> <p>So, now I'm in business. I'm on the internet. And every day, more and more people look at the site. I don't expect it to directly increase our business, but it is a great shop window. I can direct people to our site, and it makes us look a lot more professional. </p> <p><strong> Where to buy web software</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Free or cheap programs</strong> <br> These companies provide programs that are easy to use: </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.sausage.com\" target=\"_new\">www.sausage.com</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.optima-system.com/pagespinner\">www.sausage.com/pagespinner</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.gosplash.com/\">www.gosplash.com/</a></p> <p> <strong> Free trials</strong> <br> Microsoft's rival to DreamWeaver <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/\">www.microsoft.com/frontpage</a><br> Freeway 2.0 is easy to use <a href=\"http://www.softpress.com/Mainframeset.html\">www.softpress.com/Mainframeset.html</a></p>",

Later, I was able to update this to be a graphic with the pages listed on it. I used the image-mapping tool to create the links. I also wanted to create a \"contact me\" page, but didn't want to have to bother with complicated scripts that let people type straight into the internet browser page. So I cheated. I typed in my name, highlighted the text then selected E-mail Link on the objects menu. A popup window turned it into a link that opens your email program and enters the right address. After much trial and error, I had the site in a shape where it wouldn't discredit the company. Then I had to get it on the net. I needed an address for it, and that means getting a domain name. It was important to us that it was a name for which we could have not only the .co.uk address, but also .com, which is better for the rest of the world. I used a site called register.com to buy contentgenerators.com and contentgenerators.co.uk. The .com cost $70 for two years and the .co.uk \u00a349 for two years. These are standard costs. After looking around, I decided to use a company called Icom.com to host the site. It is based in the United States, but on the web, this makes no difference. It's also cheap - a set up fee of $49 then just $8.95 a month for 45MB of space (trust me, more than you will ever need for a small business), unlimited traffic, email accounts and a domain name. Your internet service provider can give you web space, but if it is free or cheap it will be under their umbrella domain name, such as www.mybusiness.online.net, which can look unprofessional. Next you have to get your site on to the internet. Again, this was relatively simple using Dreamweaver. Icom sent me an email with all the details I needed to enter into Dreamweaver's site set up window and then I clicked \"connect\" and moved the entire sites into the public_html folder using the built in FTP (file transfer protocol) software. Many other programs, such as Fetch or Anarchie, are available to download for free - but they are a bit more complicated. Finally, email. Any messages sent to a name followed by @contentgenerators.com will get to me. All I had to do was set up a new account in my email program (under the preferences file, normally) using the details Icom.com had given me. I thought it was just a matter of waiting. Wrong. If you build it, they won't necessarily come. In the first few days, no one came. Then I discovered sites such as Submitit.com, which gave me a free trial. It checked my site for efficiency, broken links and so on and then, with my help, submitted it to a whole variety of search engines. My business partner, who knows a lot about these things, wrote the meta tags for our site. These should go at the top of the index page. Although they don't appear on the page, meta tags are what the search engines look for when they catalogue your page. So, now I'm in business. I'm on the internet. And every day, more and more people look at the site. I don't expect it to directly increase our business, but it is a great shop window. I can direct people to our site, and it makes us look a lot more professional. Where to buy web software Free or cheap programs These companies provide programs that are easy to use: www.sausage.com www.sausage.com/pagespinner www.gosplash.com/ Free trials Microsoft's rival to DreamWeaver www.microsoft.com/frontpage Freeway 2.0 is easy to use www.softpress.com/Mainframeset.html",

The site at www.villains.co.uk includes features on how Y2K went wrong for the criminal fraternity and how to build an atom bomb then cheekily links itself to the websites of MI5 and the CIA. Laugh?

      "body": "<p><strong> That old black magic</strong></p> <p><strong> Faust</strong> Cryo PC CD-rom \u00a329.99 <br> <strong> Atlantis 2</strong> Cryo PC CD-rom \u00a329.99 </p> <p>One unfortunate consequence of the regular increases in graphical and processing power is that some gaming genres get prematurely retired. Take 2D platform games for example. </p> <p>Castlevania, on the PlayStation, was a superb title whose charms were widely ignored by a 3D-obsessed audience, and it's the same with point and click adventure titles. </p> <p>The genre - developed by Lucasarts in the late 80s, and including classics like Monkey Island - has become increasingly overlooked by publishers, despite the sophistication of recent offerings such as Grim Fandango. Sad news indeed for anyone who enjoyed the style and wit of Guybrush Threepwood and co. </p> <p>Bucking this trend, however, French developer Cryo has released two new adventures. The first, Faust, is set in an eerie theme park called Dreamland. As an emissary from above, your task is to listen to a motley bunch give their life-stories while assessing their suitability for entrance to the afterlife. </p> <p>Progress is made by finding objects, solving puzzles and moving your cursor wildly round the screen in the search for hotspots - areas with which you can interact. These can often be annoyingly sensitive and cause the main problem in an atmospheric, if slightly odd, adventure. </p> <p>Atlantis2 is a slower paced, Myst-style yarn involving sibling rivalry, set across some beautifully-drawn global landscapes. The authentic information about these areas does veer worryingly into infotainment territory while the solemnity of proceedings will be off-putting for Lucasarts veterans. </p> <p>However, the puzzle-heavy nature will enthrall cerebral gamesplayers and there is plenty of scope for extensive beard scratching. </p> <p>While neither title is perfect, their very existence will satisfy adventurers everywhere, and raise hopes of similar titles in the future. (GH)</p> <p><strong> Cartman and carts </strong><br> </p> <p><strong> South Park Rally</strong> Sony PlayStation \u00a339.99 Tantalus Interactive/Acclaim </p> <p> Hitting cows is no problem, but the snowploughs can flip you over, and being hit by a school bus is no joke. Or rather, it is a joke in South Park Rally, which is not big on realism. Or graphics. Or plotting. </p> <p>The story is that, every year, South Park holds a race round snow-covered local streets and roads. South Park Rally lets you compete as Cartman, Stan, Kyle, Kenny or another character - there are 27 available. Foul play is almost obligatory, and various levels have a wide range of weapons and hazards. The action can get frantic. </p> <p>But the graphics are crude, on the PlayStation, and the sound effects - characters making typical quips - are repetitive. These don't encourage you to keep going with what is quite a hard game, and you have to earn all the extra tracks and features: as a beginner, you get only one. There is a two-player mode that, even on the arcade level, can be fun. (The forthcoming PC, Sega Dreamcast and Nintendo 64 versions will all support four players.) </p> <p>South Park Rally is the best South Park game so far, but that's not saying much. There are a lot better games on the market, even in the post-Christmas slump. (JS) </p> <p><strong> Cannon fodder </strong> </p> <p><strong> Spec Ops II: US Green Berets</strong> Zombie/Take 2/Ripcord </p> <p> Spec Ops: US Army Rangers, released in 1998, was a deserved hit: simple to pick up, well balanced, and often gripping. As the first team combat strategy title, it was ground-breaking, too. </p> <p>In the interim, we've had Rainbow Six, Commandos, and Hidden &amp; Dangerous... but to look at Spec Ops II, you wouldn't know it. Sure, it has more features -multiplayer capability, new weapons, dynamic lighting and music - but these have generally conspired to make the game more cumbersome. </p> <p>As well as mouse commands, there are no fewer than 44 keys to keep track of.

      "bodyText": "That old black magic Faust Cryo PC CD-rom \u00a329.99 Atlantis 2 Cryo PC CD-rom \u00a329.99 One unfortunate consequence of the regular increases in graphical and processing power is that some gaming genres get prematurely retired. Take 2D platform games for example. Castlevania, on the PlayStation, was a superb title whose charms were widely ignored by a 3D-obsessed audience, and it's the same with point and click adventure titles. The genre - developed by Lucasarts in the late 80s, and including classics like Monkey Island - has become increasingly overlooked by publishers, despite the sophistication of recent offerings such as Grim Fandango. Sad news indeed for anyone who enjoyed the style and wit of Guybrush Threepwood and co. Bucking this trend, however, French developer Cryo has released two new adventures. The first, Faust, is set in an eerie theme park called Dreamland. As an emissary from above, your task is to listen to a motley bunch give their life-stories while assessing their suitability for entrance to the afterlife. Progress is made by finding objects, solving puzzles and moving your cursor wildly round the screen in the search for hotspots - areas with which you can interact. These can often be annoyingly sensitive and cause the main problem in an atmospheric, if slightly odd, adventure. Atlantis2 is a slower paced, Myst-style yarn involving sibling rivalry, set across some beautifully-drawn global landscapes. The authentic information about these areas does veer worryingly into infotainment territory while the solemnity of proceedings will be off-putting for Lucasarts veterans. However, the puzzle-heavy nature will enthrall cerebral gamesplayers and there is plenty of scope for extensive beard scratching. While neither title is perfect, their very existence will satisfy adventurers everywhere, and raise hopes of similar titles in the future. (GH) Cartman and carts South Park Rally Sony PlayStation \u00a339.99 Tantalus Interactive/Acclaim Hitting cows is no problem, but the snowploughs can flip you over, and being hit by a school bus is no joke. Or rather, it is a joke in South Park Rally, which is not big on realism. Or graphics. Or plotting. The story is that, every year, South Park holds a race round snow-covered local streets and roads. South Park Rally lets you compete as Cartman, Stan, Kyle, Kenny or another character - there are 27 available. Foul play is almost obligatory, and various levels have a wide range of weapons and hazards. The action can get frantic. But the graphics are crude, on the PlayStation, and the sound effects - characters making typical quips - are repetitive. These don't encourage you to keep going with what is quite a hard game, and you have to earn all the extra tracks and features: as a beginner, you get only one. There is a two-player mode that, even on the arcade level, can be fun. (The forthcoming PC, Sega Dreamcast and Nintendo 64 versions will all support four players.) South Park Rally is the best South Park game so far, but that's not saying much. There are a lot better games on the market, even in the post-Christmas slump. (JS) Cannon fodder Spec Ops II: US Green Berets Zombie/Take 2/Ripcord Spec Ops: US Army Rangers, released in 1998, was a deserved hit: simple to pick up, well balanced, and often gripping. As the first team combat strategy title, it was ground-breaking, too. In the interim, we've had Rainbow Six, Commandos, and Hidden &amp; Dangerous... but to look at Spec Ops II, you wouldn't know it. Sure, it has more features -multiplayer capability, new weapons, dynamic lighting and music - but these have generally conspired to make the game more cumbersome. As well as mouse commands, there are no fewer than 44 keys to keep track of. Why does the \"use item\" command need to be assigned to a different key from \"open door\"? Why can't the flashlight be incorporated into the inventory? As a highly trained US army officer, you're more likely to be undone by your typing skills than you are by poor strategy or slow reflexes. The character models are singularly unattractive. This bunch of squaddies would have trouble pulling at a disco. Of all the myriad camera angles, there isn't one from which it's easy to pick out your target except sniper mode, where you can't see anything but. And don't rely on your teammates to get you out of a sticky situation: chances are they'll have thrown themselves under the nearest enemy truck five seconds into the mission. On the plus side, gameplay is smooth enough, and the sound effects are invariably spot on. But all in all, this is not a game that will be winning any medals. (AB)",

He was born in Durham, the son of a militantly left miner and devout churchman. Willie attended Puddock Stile elementary school in Newbottle, where he experienced at nine his first twinges of republicanism after having to wait for two hours in the cold to cheer a royal.

It was as such he contested West Fife in 1945. But his Communist opponent, Willie Gallacher, could then still harvest Scottish working class enthusiasm for the victorious Red Army. By 1950, the cold war had changed all that and - with the help of the local Catholic Action - Gallacher wound up in third place.

On one occasion he lined up with an anti-Communist Tory MP to attack the \"treacherous activities\" of the Daily Worker correspondent in Korea. He was furious at Britain's 1956 invasion of Egypt, favouring strikes, if necessary, to end it. He hailed the Hungarian uprising as an \"overwhelming defeat for the Soviet Union\". He was always on the side of those who wanted to expel leftwing rebels.</p> <p>Curiously enough, Ted Heath's enthusiasm for the European Economic Community helped him. In the wake of boundary changes, he found it easier to be adopted for the new Central Fife seat after he told activists he would support EEC entry, admitting \"I'm a (Roy) Jenkins man\". He served as an appointed member of the European Assembly 1975-79. But, as a Durham man, he was no Scottish devolutionist, declaring in 1976 that it was a \"a big step\" down the road to separatism.</p> <p>His attacks on the knighthood for Anthony Eden and birthday celebrations for Winston Churchill were hardly noticed; but he hit paydirt in 1971 when he described Princess Margaret as \"this expensive kept woman\" for her \u00a382,000 allowance.

He introduced a bill to abolish hereditary peerages. In 1983 he said the Queen should have her inflation-geared overpayment clawed back like that of old-age pensioners.</p> <p>That this royal-baiting was publicity-driven was indicated by the fact that he and his royalist second wife had met the Queen and Prince Philip the year before at Glenrothes. His first wife died in 1968 and there was some hilarity when he struck up a friendship with Tory MP Janet Fookes, whose embarrassment at being linked with so public an anti-royalist was ended when he married his former school friend, Mrs Margaret Cogle, in 1982.</p> <p>In contrast to the publicity for his royal-bashing, his hard work for Commons select committees went almost unnoticed.

There had been a failed leftwing effort to oust him and he had not made himself more popular with the left in 1984 when he opposed the proposal for all Labour MPs to contribute \u00a35 a week to the Arthur Scargill-led miners' strike.

      "bodyText": "Suvi Raj Grubb, who has died in Pune, India, aged 82, was - to his own surprise - a leading figure in classical recording from the 1970s until his retirement in 1985. That was when his company, EMI, was recording with such artists as Otto Klemperer, Carlo Maria Giulini, Dame Janet Baker, Andr\u00e9 Previn, Itzhak Perlman and Daniel Barenboim. Grubb worked with all of them, and was primarily responsible for the emergence of Barenboim as a recording artist.

Last year Mr Mahuad reacted to the deepening economic crisis by freezing bank accounts, but paid $700m to one bank to keep it afloat, causing public outrage. Two weeks ago the former president drew up the \"Law of Stabilisation\", which would replace the sucre with the US dollar in the hope of curbing inflation and allowing the country to borrow money at US interest rates. Indian and labour leaders denounced the plan as little more than a lifeline to corrupt bankers and big business, while the poor watched food items double in price over the past fortnight. The dollarisation of the economy would also wipe out much of the value of frozen savings accounts, which were deposited at 7,000 sucres to the dollar, but will be withdrawn at 25,000 to the dollar, according to the current exchange rate. The mishandling of the economic crisis cost Mr Mahuad his job last Saturday. Mr Noboa, who was his vice president, is the fourth president to take office in two years. Antonio Vargas, leader of the powerful Indian confederation, Conaie, announced that his organisation would give the new administration six months to reverse the economic decline or face renewed mass protest. In the past century Ecuador has relied on single cash crops to support its economy, first textiles, then cocoa, then bananas and finally oil - much of which backfired when world prices collapsed. Thousands of small account holders, many of them pensioners, fear they may die before they ever see the small nest eggs they deposited in banks when a degree of faith still existed in local financial institutions. Ecuador suffered a 60% inflation rate last year, while unemployment has risen to 20% and the cost of the foreign debt is equal to the country's GNP, approximately $15bn. \"We must all have faith in Ecuador and work together to overcome this difficult situation\" Mr Noboa said yesterday But he faces an uphill task as he relies on support from a deeply-divided congress, where deputies face elections for a new parliament in two months.",

Sometimes she didn't want to say that she had Jewish origins.\" He said there was no longer any official anti-semitism in Ukraine. It was the little things that disturbed him. Where he comes from, there is a Christmas tradition of dressing up to represent stock characters. One is the Jew. Ms Sloboda produced a photograph of a figure in a grotesque mask with a red face and a long nose. \"His role is to scare the children,\" said Mr Sloboda. \"I have no intention of living off social security forever,\" he added. \"I have taught myself some German in Ukraine. I hope that in a year I will be able to speak it fluently. I am under no illusions about the difficulties of rebuilding my career here. But I already have friends in a couple of pharmaceutical companies in Germany.\" Such intentions are characteristic of the new arrivals, said Ms Peuke. \"But I always caution them to take things slowly.\" \"If they are young and active, they make out somehow, legally or illegally,\" said Irene Runge, co-author of a guide book for new Jewish immigrants. \"The real difficulty is for the 'sandwich generation', those in the 40 to 50 age bracket. We get experts in Greek philosophy. They know Greek, Latin, English and French, but not German. Those people face a challenge.\" At 38, Yuri Sloboda is on the cusp. Yet he is heartened by what he has already seen. He has just read Ms Runge's guide, which says that 15% of Germans hold anti-semitic views. \"Here at least it is in the open. You would never find those sorts of facts in a publication in Ukraine. Here you have sociological data and open discussion.\" His wife was more pragmatic. \"In Ukraine, I did not hear of any emigrants coming back\", she said. \"People of Jewish origins are very sensitive to oppression. If they sense danger, they move on. If there were a danger, they would have left.\"",

A month ago, two local, privately owned internet service providers (ISPs) were shut down. The only ISP left is the government-operated Myanmar Posts &amp; Telecommunications. The country's 1996 computer law decrees that only those with official authorisation can use the internet. A cybercafe opened in the capital Rangoon last year, but it offered no access to the internet. Indonesia Internet newsgroups and websites were used to mobilise support for East Timor's battle for independence both inside and outside Indonesia. A year ago, an Irish-based ISP was forced to shut down after the East Timorese site it was hosting was bombarded by cyber \"terrorists\". The Indonesian government was implicated in the attack on the website. Jordan The Jordanian government maintains that \"there is no blocking or censoring by the government of the content of any websites or of electronic communications via newsgroups, email or other internet forums\". Jordanians have used the internet to access foreign newspapers banned in Jordan, but Human Rights Watch has found evidence of state suppression of online political activity. Last October, two university students were arrested for trying to launch a website to \"combat normalisation\" of relations with Israel. The Jordan Times wrote: \"It is somewhat worrying that the authorities were not more forthcoming in describing the nature of the students' offences in creating the website.\" Malaysia Email and newsgroups were widely used by students in the 1998 uprisings against the Malaysian government. Four people were arrested that year and charged with spreading email rumours about riots in the capital, Kuala Lumpur. In December 1998, the government ruled that cybercafes must record all people who use their computers. The government vowed that the police would examine all internet postings in the country. But there are signs that Malaysia is relaxing its internet regulations. Last spring the prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, announced that internet access would be free from censorship. Sri Lanka Last August, a Sri Lankan government minister admitted intercepting an email sent to the leader of the country's opposition from the British advertising company, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. The science and technology minister, Batty Weerakoon, admitted he handed the email to the state-run media. The opposition said the incident was typical of the government's snooping on private emails between politicians, journalists and private businessmen.",

      "bodyText": "General Pinochet has been driven off the front pages of Chile's newspapers by a naked performance artist. Much larger crowds than those which rallied last weekend in support of the general have been clogging the streets of central Santiago to glimpse the woman taking a shower in a transparent house. The house is part of a piece of performance art designed to reflect the limits of privacy in society, according to the director of Fondart, the government's arts fund which is sponsoring the project. For the next two months, the actor Daniella Tobar will carry on her daily life in the specially constructed house which stands on an empty building site in the heart of the city. Every morning she will get up at around 9am, brush her teeth, take a shower, attend to her bodily functions and eat her breakfast in full view of people on their way to work. \"It is a call for people to reflect on the relationship between the public and the private,\" said Nivia Palma, the director of Fondart. As part of the project, named Nautilus, the passers-by who stop to watch are filmed. Nautilus is the brainchild of two young architects, Arturo Torres and Jorge Cristi, who say they accept that not everyone will understand what they are trying to achieve. \"We are taking the notion of art to the limit in the sense that life can be an artistic work,\" said Mr Torres, who has been working on the idea for two years.

Since the 1973 military coup, artists and actors have often been regarded by Pinochet supporters as subversives. It was not long before the police arrived to question Tobar and see whether an offence against public decency was being committed. They left after seeing her identity card. She has described the project as an interesting experience which she is enjoying. The news coverage has focused on the notion of what art is, whether the government should be funding the project to the tune of \u00a36,000 and how many showers one should take in such hot weather. During the recent presidential election campaign, there were calls for greater transparency in public life in a country that is still emerging from the dark days of dictatorship, but the transparency on Moneda Street might not be exactly what the candidates had in mind. The house is not permanent and will be taken to Buenos Aires for a repeat performance. Despite some criticism from city officials that Tobar's performance was taking place too close to a nearby church, the general reaction on the street, even among older residents, seemed favourable, with many jokes being cracked and cheerful al fresco discussions breaking out. Tobar is fast becoming a celebrity as hundreds assemble to tell her just what people in glass houses should do.",

      "body": "<p>Old age drove Lexy Campbell, the last resident, off Taransay. But for the rest of her life, there wasn't a day that went by when she didn't look back over the short, green stretch of sea from her new home at Seilebost on nearby Harris.</p> <p>Neighbours say she would have stayed out on Taransay all her days if she could have, instead of passing her final two decades watching from the window when the light was good.</p> <p>Quite what Lexy would have made of the comings and goings on the remote island of Taransay these past few weeks is anyone's guess. Most think she would have been bemused. Some say she would have been horrified. Others suspect she might have quite enjoyed it all, especially the lights at night, shining out across the darkness of the sound - proof of a new community on her beloved island.</p> <p>But the truth is that not everybody is home on Taransay. In fact a pretty large proportion of the BBC's celebrated castaways actually seem to be here, a mile and a half away across the water on the island of Harris. Ensconced in the warmth of the Harris Hotel in Tarbert, they are taking tea and arguing about the ablutions on their temporary home.</p> <p>\"Public health are coming to have a look at it and once they see there's only one toilet for 50 people, they'll see how bad it is,\" says one woman in a smart waterproof.</p> <p>\"Five scones, please,\" says another, as the waitress hovers patiently for their order. They seem to have acquired a dog - Charlie, a collie - and make plans to watch themselves on TV later from the sofas in the residents' lounge. They introduce themselves to other guests as the castaways, and ask if they can switch to BBC1.</p> <p>Charlie gets walked in the hotel garden and the children play chase around the chairs and tables, getting bored and restless. A helicopter, specially chartered by the programme makers, shifts them back and forward from the island; commuting, really. This is clearly not how it was supposed to be and it's getting dreadfully tense.</p> <p>It must have looked good on paper, though. Drop 36 complete strangers on an uninhabited island on Hogmanay, give them some help to build their eco-pod homes, film them for the first few weeks then give them a video camera, leave them to it and watch the ratings rise. They weren't supposed to come off the island. At least not this often.</p> <p>Yesterday, with the press gathering in hordes in the hotel's public bar, the show's executive producer Jeremy Mills held an impromptu news conference and admitted that the community has become split between those who are staying on the island and those staying in the hotel.</p> <p>He lists 18 people who have been off the island for some or most of the time. Most are families, some are ill. Jeremy thinks this is a good thing. He won't accept that the BBC's \u00a32.4m flagship millennium project is disintegrating into chaos and farce before his eyes.</p> <p>\"From my point of view all that is fantastic material,\" he says brightly. \"The pressure that it's put them all under as two groups of people has brought out some utterly fascinating insights into human nature and human relationships from a TV point of view. That's the key thing.\"</p> <p>The castaways in the hotel don't look so sure. They say they'd love to talk, that all is not well, but contracts are keeping them quiet. Jeremy says if they did talk they would have to leave. One family are considering doing just that. The programme makers have told the troubled castaways that Friday is the deadline for getting back to the island if they want to stay in the show. A kind of relaunch. All or nothing. Stay or go.</p> <p>When the castaways got there, Taransay itself was much as Lexy had left it. A few small buildings falling to ruin, a sheltered beach - and sheep. Now they have a washing machine - cold water only - shower facilities and a school.</p> <p>But there's also been the flu, and forces of nature, and roofs blown off, and crates of belongings dropped in the sea, and housing blocks not ready, and chickens that never came and personalities that didn't mesh.</p> <p>Just round the corner from the hotel in the kitchen of her neat terraced house, 88-year-old Mary Munro makes you tea and laughs gently at the complete absurdity of it all. She can remember being on Taransay with Lexy, her second cousin, when they were children, spending hours scraping crotal, a form of lichen, off the rocks to dye the Harris Tweed.</p> <p>\"There were about 12 to 14 houses then, and a community,\" she says. \"It was lovely. It is very different now. We were used to doing without water. There was no washing machine. You just had to get on and do it all. We were quite happy with it, doing everything, You used to have to draw the water from the well, bring it home and heat it and do the washing. Quite a handful when I think on it now.</p> <p>\"The castaways aren't isolated the way they were in the old days. If the weather was bad you couldn't get a doctor over. Mind you, we never seemed to be sick in those days.\"</p> <p>She's not being judgmental - she has quite enjoyed the spectacle these past weeks and is not surprised so many of the visitors seem to be spending their time in the shelter of Tarbert. \"Ach, they wouldn't be used to it. They had to bring them over here. They had small children and you couldn't put children through that. They seem very nice. One or two looked a bit like hippies but mostly they are very respectable. It really quite brightens up the place.\"</p> <p>And the local economy. At Tarbert Stores, Jane Morrison has been doing a roaring trade in everything from fishing rods and torches to batteries and sweets.</p> <p>\"They buy quite a lot of things from us locally,\" she says. \"They're no different from anyone else we have coming into the shop.</p> <p>\"I don't disapprove of what they're doing. They're not bothering us at all. They seem to be very nice people, all of them that have been in. It's quite a change for them to be stuck there for a year. We were brought up on that, but they weren't. It's nice to see the lights there - it looks more homely.\"</p> <p>Mary Munro, too, has seen the benefit. \"My son runs the bunkhouse that they stayed in the first weekend and my other son who runs a shop has had quite a lot of orders from them. All the stuff they're eating. I think they pick it up. They have a helicopter to take in everything they need. Tarbert's doing well from them.\"</p> <p>Not everyone is so pleased, though. Bill Lawson, a well-known local historian, feels the community has been duped by the strangers in their midst. Lawson visited Lexy and her family when they still lived on Taransay and remembers the warmth and welcome of a real home.</p> <p>\"The hotel is doing very well because it's filled with those who are supposed to be on the island,\" he says. \"The shops are doing well and the tradesmen in Stornoway, on the nearby island of Lewis, are doing nicely repairing all the storm damage. It's bound to help the tourist industry as well. My thoughts are that if you're going to waste \u00a32m on something then yes please, waste it here.</p> <p>'If this now was a real social experiment I wouldn't mind so much but there's much misinformation coming out now about what's happening. There is a bit of bad feeling. We keep getting told that everybody's over on the island and the people you meet in Tarbert are just a figment of your imagination. The helicopters that you see ferrying back and forth aren't really there. It might have started off as a survival exercise but it's all mod cons now. It's nothing like the life that Lexy had.\"</p> <p>Most here say lack of preparation and lack of understanding of the nature of Taransay has been the biggest hurdle to the project's success. But anyone within a stone's throw of the island could have advised them on the best time to start the project. For all its beauty Taransay is a harsh, unforgiving home when the winter storms come rolling in.</p> <p>\"This past week the climate has been very, very mild but at the new year, when they were going over, it was wild,\" says Jane Morrison in the Stores. \"The worst it's been on Harris for many a year. They should have started earlier building their houses and been ready before the bad weather set in. That kept them back.\"</p> <p>Mary Munro, meanwhile, thinks if they can hang in, one good spring day will sort them all out and they will fall in love with it. How could they not with the air so clear and the sea turning turquoise as it churns onto the shore?</p> <p>And in the meantime, she says gently, who are we to be so hard on them for feeling beaten by the weather and the lack of facilities?</p> <p>After all, even Lexy Campbell quit Taransay when she felt it was time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Environmental pressure group, Greenpeace, yesterday claimed shareholder backing for its plan to block controversial plans by BP Amoco to expand its exploration for oil in Alaska. Greenpeace said it intended to halt further development of BP Amoco's Northstar exploration project at the company's annual meeting in April. The prospect of a vote on Northstar comes as BP Amoco is trying to persuade American regulators that its $27bn (\u00a316.5bn) acquisition of Atlantic Richfield should proceed despite concerns that the deal will diminish production competition in Alaska. BP said it was \"dealing with the resolution\" from Greenpeace which is signed by 100 shareholders speaking for about 150,000 shares in the company. It is understood that BP will check the identity and shareholdings of all signatories to the motion, which will take about a week. Greenpeace raised the issue of the Northstar development - which it claims uses risky and untested technology to bring oil ashore - at last year's annual meeting. Since then BP Amoco has proposed to the government that multi-national companies should be allowed to dispense with conventional annual meetings. Greenpeace has managed to exploit the activist approach of some American investors, many of which joined the investor register when BP acquired Amoco in late 1998, to gain support for its hostile motion. The need to attract the backing of more than 100 shareholders means it is very difficult to table resolutions at an annual meeting without company endorsement. One of the US investor groups that has signed up to the Greenpeace motion is Trillium Asset Management - a socially responsible investment organisation which speaks for about $600m, although not all of that is committed to voting in favour of the resolution. Simon Billenness, an analyst with Trillium, said: \"We have yet to see any sign of BP Amoco actually acting on [its] green vision.

      "trailText": "<p>Why did a middle-aged white American spend months photographing Birmingham's Jamaican immigrants? And why was his first show blocked at the last minute?  Chris Arnot  investigates</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At the beginning of last year, Larry Herman was approached by two young black men who demanded to know what the hell he thought he was doing. A fair question in the circumstances. Here was a middle-aged white man, loitering after dark in inner-city Birmingham and wielding a camera. Was he working for a newspaper? Or the police? Relations between residents and the local constabulary might have improved since the riots of the 80s but, after all, this was still Handsworth. </p> <p>Herman told them he was here to photograph British Jamaicans for a project chronicling immigrant communities all over the country. After 10 minutes of waning hostility, one of the men patted him on the shoulder and said: \"You're doing OK.\" Then they walked off, but not before he had invited them to his show at nearby Soho House, once the home of the great industrialist Matthew Boulton. </p> <p>Had they turned up there last May, they would have been disappointed. Herman's exhibition had fallen victim to the racial politics that are never far from the surface in an area like Handsworth. Soho House was recently restored as a museum and Birmingham City Council has been keen to involve those who now live in its immediate vicinity, predominantly black and Asian people. </p> <p>Questions were raised only when council employees had their first view of what Herman was proposing to exhibit. \"In no way was it a quality issue,\" says Val Loggie, curator and manager at Soho House. \"But we felt that the exhibition didn't give a balanced view of what Handsworth's like now. We were aware that some members of the black community weren't happy with the way the images were going to be presented.\" </p> <p>Other local people now have their chance to see them in an exhibition at the City College in Handsworth. \"They have to be able to make up their own minds,\" says Jenny Bartley, the college's director of curriculum. \"This is one photographer's view of the community. Some of the pictures challenge and ask questions about the conditions people are living in. That's what art's about.\" </p> <p>Herman argues that there are positive images of black achievers, such as headteacher Carlton Duncan and artist Barbara Walker. There are light-hearted images, too, such as the shot of two teenagers canoodling. Others are more controversial. In one there's just a bed, its sheets glowing white in the dimly lit ward of a hospital. The body beneath the rumpled sheet is shrouded from view, although its outline is visible. The caption refers to local concerns over the number of young black men kept in hospital as a form of social exclusion under section three of the 1983 Mental Health Act. </p> <p>\"The deputy care manager provided the words and I just subbed them down,\" the photographer insists. \"And I had permission to wander around the hospital and take which shots I liked.\" Whoever is under the sheet can't be identified from the photograph. Otherwise it would have breached a Herman article of faith: he only photographs images that the subjects want him to see, after painstakingly building up trust. </p> <p>Herman was a sculptor back home in New York. In 1968, when he was 26, Uncle Sam required his presence in Vietnam and was losing patience with four years of defiance. Given a choice between prison, the jungles of south-east Asia and London, he chose London and landed a job in the cutting room of the director Ken Loach. </p> <p>Herman was soon planning to make pictures of his own. Still ones. He was an artist who had changed his medium. \"I wanted something that would communicate with people more directly than sculpture,\" he says. </p> <p>In style, he's very different from the Bill Brandt documentary school of a carefully posed realism. \"I never move so much as a cup or a chair,\" he says, \"because I don't want to impose myself on reality. If I manipulate the image, then my photography becomes faction. Design and form is important, but my first question during the editing process is 'What do I want to say with this photograph?'\" </p> <p>His pictures have won awards on both sides of the Atlantic.

      "bodyText": "At the beginning of last year, Larry Herman was approached by two young black men who demanded to know what the hell he thought he was doing. A fair question in the circumstances. Here was a middle-aged white man, loitering after dark in inner-city Birmingham and wielding a camera. Was he working for a newspaper? Or the police? Relations between residents and the local constabulary might have improved since the riots of the 80s but, after all, this was still Handsworth. Herman told them he was here to photograph British Jamaicans for a project chronicling immigrant communities all over the country. After 10 minutes of waning hostility, one of the men patted him on the shoulder and said: \"You're doing OK.\" Then they walked off, but not before he had invited them to his show at nearby Soho House, once the home of the great industrialist Matthew Boulton. Had they turned up there last May, they would have been disappointed. Herman's exhibition had fallen victim to the racial politics that are never far from the surface in an area like Handsworth. Soho House was recently restored as a museum and Birmingham City Council has been keen to involve those who now live in its immediate vicinity, predominantly black and Asian people. Questions were raised only when council employees had their first view of what Herman was proposing to exhibit. \"In no way was it a quality issue,\" says Val Loggie, curator and manager at Soho House. \"But we felt that the exhibition didn't give a balanced view of what Handsworth's like now. We were aware that some members of the black community weren't happy with the way the images were going to be presented.\" Other local people now have their chance to see them in an exhibition at the City College in Handsworth. \"They have to be able to make up their own minds,\" says Jenny Bartley, the college's director of curriculum. \"This is one photographer's view of the community. Some of the pictures challenge and ask questions about the conditions people are living in. That's what art's about.\" Herman argues that there are positive images of black achievers, such as headteacher Carlton Duncan and artist Barbara Walker. There are light-hearted images, too, such as the shot of two teenagers canoodling. Others are more controversial. In one there's just a bed, its sheets glowing white in the dimly lit ward of a hospital. The body beneath the rumpled sheet is shrouded from view, although its outline is visible. The caption refers to local concerns over the number of young black men kept in hospital as a form of social exclusion under section three of the 1983 Mental Health Act. \"The deputy care manager provided the words and I just subbed them down,\" the photographer insists. \"And I had permission to wander around the hospital and take which shots I liked.\" Whoever is under the sheet can't be identified from the photograph. Otherwise it would have breached a Herman article of faith: he only photographs images that the subjects want him to see, after painstakingly building up trust. Herman was a sculptor back home in New York. In 1968, when he was 26, Uncle Sam required his presence in Vietnam and was losing patience with four years of defiance. Given a choice between prison, the jungles of south-east Asia and London, he chose London and landed a job in the cutting room of the director Ken Loach. Herman was soon planning to make pictures of his own. Still ones. He was an artist who had changed his medium. \"I wanted something that would communicate with people more directly than sculpture,\" he says. In style, he's very different from the Bill Brandt documentary school of a carefully posed realism. \"I never move so much as a cup or a chair,\" he says, \"because I don't want to impose myself on reality. If I manipulate the image, then my photography becomes faction. Design and form is important, but my first question during the editing process is 'What do I want to say with this photograph?'\" His pictures have won awards on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1998, he was a finalist in the International Fund for Documentary Photography, based in San Francisco. In Britain, he's managed to attract seven grants from the Arts Council. Three of them are for his project on immigrant communities, which began over five years ago. \"What marks our epoch, even more than war,\" he says, \"is the movement of people around the world. When I was a child, New York was one of the biggest cities in the world. Now Mexico City has a population of over 18m and the number of people in Cairo is going up by 1,000 a day. Britain's not isolated from this process and I wanted to record its effects in this country.\" He has photographed Kurds and Congolese in London, Yemenis in Sheffield, Bangladeshis in Bradford, Chinese in Manchester and, of course, Jamaicans in Birmingham.

      "body": "<p>Some say that Bob Fosse danced himself to death. Certainly his feet never stopped moving from the day in 1935 when he was sent to a Chicago dance class as a companion to his shy elder sister. He was just eight at the time. By the time he dropped dead of a heart attack on a Washington pavement in 1987, just a few minutes before the curtain was due to rise on his revival of Sweet Charity, the dancer-turned-choreographer-turned-director was a Broadway legend. His kooky, angular style, all pigeon toes and teacup fingers, was familiar to millions from shows such as The Pajama Game and Chicago and the Oscar-winning film Cabaret. </p> <p>Yet when Fosse died, aged just 60, Broadway was changing. Just as the burlesque clubs in which Fosse made his professional debut - and to which he owed so much of his sleazy style - had gone, so the kind of theatre for which he was famous was in decline. </p> <p>Stephen Sondheim certainly wasn't writing the kind of musical that featured dancers with bowler hats and white gloves - the trademarks that had grown out of Fosse's own insecurities about his hairline, which began to recede when he was 17, and his fingers, which refused to behave like a ballet dancer's and always spread. Broadway was being invaded by British-produced musicals such as Les Mis\u00e9rables, and when they used dancers - which was rarely - it was in a very different way from Fosse's showy style. </p> <p>Fosse was a success all his life but was so terrified of failure that he always announced himself by his full name, in case anyone asked him, \"Bob who?\" In the year before he died he suffered a crushing blow. As he was trying to come to terms with the panning of Star 80, his movie about murdered Playboy playmate Dorothy Stratton, a Broadway musical called Big Deal that he had been developing for more than 20 years closed after just 70 performances. </p> <p>In a business in which you are only as good as your last show, the pressure was on Fosse. He had once told an interviewer that he wanted to die young so that people would mourn his brilliant promise. Instead, despite the constant use of amphetamines to keep him going and Seconal to get to sleep, a history of epileptic seizures and two heart attacks, it looked as though Fosse was going to live to a ripe old age. You could say that dying was just the kind of break he needed. </p> <p>Now, 13 years after his death, fulfilling the prophecy of his 1979 autobiographical film All That Jazz, Bob Fosse is more famous than ever. Chicago has been running for two years in London, and previews have just begun in the West End for Fosse, an all-singing, all-dancing celebration of the man's work that has already wowed Broadway. It seems that Fosse was absolutely right when he once joked: \"I'll have to be dead to find out if I'm any good.\" </p> <p>The Fosse revival is almost entirely down to one woman: Gwen Verdon, a small red-haired ball of energy who was the last of Fosse's three wives. A Broadway hoofer and a legend in her own right, Verdon, who is now in her 70s, was the mother of his only child, a daughter called Nicole, and his muse - and the woman who made Bob Fosse have faith in himself. </p> <p>'He was a driven man. His family was Norwegian and he had that dark Scandinavian side to him. He worked and worried himself to death. He never believed he was good enough,\" recalls Verdon, who was by Fosse's side when he died, even though they had been separated for more than 20 years. \"We were separated, but we were always together. He never missed a Thanksgiving or a Christmas. He'd always say 'Why doesn't my house feel like a home?'\" says Verdon proudly. </p> <p>She is a forgiving woman. She refuses to talk in any detail about their private life, but Fosse was a serial womaniser as well as having an addictive personality. Verdon likes to play down that side of Fosse, shrugging off the drug-taking by saying that he exaggerated his exploits and suggesting that back in the 60s people weren't so aware of the dangers of amphetamines. \"Even airline pilots took them to stay awake.\" </p> <p>While Verdon acts the loyal wife, protecting both Fosse's reputation and artistic legacy, she makes little of her own contribution to his success. Yet Verdon was always much more than a wife and a muse to Fosse - she was also his \"mother\", his inspiration, his teacher and his collaborator. Those who saw them dance together say that it was like watching two people have sex. Without Verdon, Fosse would never have been the choreographer and director he became. </p> <p>Verdon gives Fosse all the credit for the showpiece dance Whatever Lola Wants, Lola Gets from the 1955 musical Damn Yankees - in which he really made his name. But many say that it owes a lot to Verdon herself, her mannerisms and her training with Jack Cole, a choreographer who brought a touch of the exotic East to the American lounge dance circuit. The sexy-funny effect of Lola had similarities with the satirical sexiness of Marilyn Monroe singing I'm Just a Little Girl from Little Rock in the 1953 movie Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Who had taught Monroe how to do it? Gwen Verdon. </p> <p>Without Verdon, whom Fosse married in 1960, Fosse would never have got the break that allowed him to make the step from being a choreographer to a director. Verdon, by then big box office, only agreed to star in the musical Redhead on condition that Fosse be given the chance to direct. To the end of his life, Verdon was often to be found side by side with Fosse in the rehearsal room. When people talk about Fosse style, they mean Verdon style, too. Fosse may have got a reputation for being a star-maker - Shirley MacLaine, Liza Minnelli and Ann Reinking were just a few who got their breaks in Fosse shows - but it was Verdon who gave him the breaks, and it is she who ensures his legacy lives on. </p> <p>In some ways, Verdon thinks he never died. \"Sometimes I think he is up there hovering over us, watching what is going on and smiling,\" she says. And perhaps he is. On the night that Fosse died, Joel Grey was also in Washington, on stage playing the Master of Ceremonies in Cabaret, a repeat of the screen role for which he had won an Oscar. Looking out into the auditorium as he sang the final reprise of Life is a Cabaret, Grey swears that he saw Fosse sitting there in the dark. He had been pronounced dead at Washington University Hospital two hours previously.</p>",

But his scalding concert to open the Barbican Jazz 2000 season overturned all narrow views of his talents. </p> <p>The gig was a triple-header. The Masada String Trio began, with the lilting, softly insinuating Yiddisher dance-music themes Zorn has adopted in the 90s. These were beautifully expressed by violinist Mark Feldman, who can play the instrument on his lap like a jazz guitar, or produce stomping riff-packed solos like a hoe-down fiddler. His technique makes the most passing sound sing. The material mixed explosive Ornette Coleman-like pieces (Coleman, John Cage, Anthony Braxton and Derek Bailey are the self-taught Zorn's big influences) with mellifluousness. Dense melo- dies tumbled with notes separated by sudden crash-stops. Feldman's exchanges with improvising cellist Erik Friedlander absorbingly fused jazz's rhythmic elasticity and classical music's sonorities. Bassist Greg Cohen was a rock and a gazelle in all three bands, sometimes both at once. </p> <p>The second set, from the septet Bar Kokhba, brought some of the trio's material into contact with Latin rhythms, engagingly mingling the acoustic strings with Marc Ribot's twangy, 60s-surfer guitar. It often worked up a whooping clamour that brought the show an urgent intensity. Zorn lounged in a chair but the beseeching movements of his hands and fluttering of his fingers for tempo changes confirmed his presence in the music's shape. </p> <p>The Masada quartet's finale was the killer. Though much of the material preserved the night's cultural references, Zorn's saxophone-playing revealed both tender lyricism and rawness (flat-out, he sometimes suggests the abstract multiphonics of UK virtuoso Evan Parker). His no-prisoners exchanges with Dave Douglas were astonishing: Douglas brilliantly combines free-music's looseness with bop trumpet's discipline, and he was contributing to a remarkable exposition of jazz at the limits. The music changed pace and shape so quickly that he took to playing out of the corner of his mouth so he could watch his mercurial partner at the same time. </p> <p>Balancing chaos and order has long been Zorn's mission, and fans of his hellraising free-style might find his enthusiasm for strict rules contradictory. But he has always been prepared to alternate the worlds of \"out\" and \"in\" music, and this concert showed how creatively the two can come together.

Liz Phelps, a policy officer at Nacab, said it was delighted by the move but that it would still press for primary legislation to ensure equal treatment for all borrowers. \"There will be some lenders who do not follow the CML line and there will be some lenders who are not members of the CML.\" Nacab is also putting pressure on lenders to moderate their treatment of borrowers in arrears who have already been contacted.",

This year heralds one of the most radical shake-ups ever experienced by the sector which has, until very recently, enjoyed a well deserved reputation for corporate somnambulance. The latest league tables, published yesterday by the Combined Actuarial Performance Service, illustrate some of the issues now being grappled with by the companies trying to invest sufficiently successfully to ensure millions of workers can retire in some form of comfort. The CAPS annual survey of pension fund managers showed all but one or two of the largest investment organisations were eclipsed by the performance of small, often newly formed organisations. At the top of the performance league was Orbitex, with 1% of Mercury's assets under management, while Fuji-Lord Abbett - a joint venture between the Japanese Fuji Bank and independent American investment group Lord Abbett - came second. Gartmore, the fund management business NatWest has put up for sale in its desperate attempt to escape the predatory assault of both Scottish banks, was the only one of the \"big five\" investment groups to make it into the top 10. Nicola Horlick, the so-called superwoman who so spectacularly quit Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, seems to be living up to her nickname by managing 12th ranking. The other end of the performance league table, however, is positively bursting with big names such as Phillips &amp; Drew and Legal &amp; General. The results are by no means a one-off - the rise of the fleet of foot fund at the expense of behemoths has been a feature of the past three or four years. Although Legal &amp; General appears to have stumbled during the past 12 months, the previous success of its huge index tracker fund, which invests in proportion to the weighting of firms on the stock market, raised the spectre of whether active stock selection was about to become a thing of the past. That debate was given added momentum when L&amp;G became the first to declare itself happy to offer the government's stakeholder pensions at the proposed 1% commission. The group argued that it could accommodate a fee seen in traditional terms as derisory because the costs of running an index tracking business are lower than its active equivalent. But just as L&amp;G seemed set to hoover up all the prospective work-place pensions business - the company also planned to cut costs by offering financial advice on a group rather than individual basis - the companies started to feel queazy about the implications of funnelling workers into the arms of a single pension provider. One pension fund manager of a FTSE 100 company said : \"When you look at all the problems there have been about private pensions mis-selling and then think about the rising trend to take legal action, then we have got to be careful not to be seen to be pushing people towards one investment firm or another.\" His company is now considering establishing a panel of pension providers with a different risk profile so employees are offered a wider work-place choice. But another FTSE100 pension fund manager - whose company intends simply to expand its scheme to meet the requirements of stakeholder pensions - says there is a real doubt that employees will want to sign up at all. While some big organisations are now trying to find out how to encourage people to invest, others are increasingly worried that employees who are already members of their pension fund will try to take a pop at them if they fail to measure up to the ethical investment statement fund trustees must publish this summer. The debate about where a fund's money is invested resurfaced last week, when it emerged that Phillips &amp; Drew had put some of the Labour party's superannuation money into Huntingdon Life Sciences, a company which undertakes experiments on animals. \"I think this whole thing is a minefield,\" commented one pension fund manager who is also a trustee. \"Clearly we want to try to invest in a socially responsible way, but we have a fiduciary duty to do the best for our pension fund members. \"I'm worried that we will produce an investment statement which will either be so vague as to be pretty meaningless or which could be a hostage to fortune and will lay us open to attack.\"",

They are cumbersome things involving special taxes, and are only really used by American institutions such as pension funds. </p> <p>It is doubtful that many British retail investors pay much attention to the small cost at the bottom of their hopelessly complicated trading statements. There is little chance of them deciding to trade simply to avoid stamp duty. At a professional level, the big players with offshore trading arms have been avoiding the tax for years using the mechanism of \"contracts for difference\" - effectively synthetic shares. Any investor can, of course, use one of the growing number of financial bookmakers where, famously, the winnings are tax-free and so are the losses. </p> <p>That said, Britain's stamp duty remains the highest in the world, and is a real impediment to creating a vibrant pan-European stock market. </p> <p>Meeting the last government's promise in 1992 to scrap the tax now would amount to a big, bright signal from this government that it does understand why the stock market exists and how important it is to business and the UK's standing internationally. </p> <p>Yet the tax brought \u00a32bn to the treasury's coffers in the year to last April, and the figure for the current year has probably all but doubled, given the outbreak of crazy punting by the public. This is why there is no chance of stamp duty disappearing in the short term. </p> <p>Setting Labour's funding plans aside, the mere idea of giving the stock market an adrenaline shot in its present state would appear positively Lawsonesque. </p> <p><strong>Decline and fall</strong></p> <p>Rarely in the history of corporate mergers has so much shareholder value been destroyed by so few so quickly. The decline and fall of Somerfield since it merged with Kwik-Save has been brief and, for investors, extremely painful. Sales and profits plummeted as the entire basis of the takeover proved riddled with errors, with the shares collapsing at one stage from 494p to 58p. </p> <p>Last November chief executive David Simons, whose vision landed Somerfield in this situation, announced a new idea - to get rid of half the Kwik-Save stores for which he paid so handsomely but which were now dragging down the rest of the company, sell off up to 144 of Somerfield's biggest supermarkets and concentrate on becoming the finest convenience store group. </p> <p>Three months on, and 45 big stores have been sold - well actually, 19 have been sold and Somerfield has options to sell the other 26. But four in 10 of the big stores have been withdrawn because no buyer is willing to pay the fancy prices demanded. Ultimately, the company conceded yesterday, if the bids being made are not good enough it could be left with seven out of 10 of the big stores it said it wanted to get rid of. </p> <p>Announcing the plan in November Mr Simons said the sell-off would allow Somerfield to \"focus on our core high street retailing skills\". Yet the stores it still hopes to sell are the largest of its out of town shops. </p> <p>Meanwhile there is no sign of a buyer for the burdensome 400-strong Kwik-Save estate, and now the company concedes that it will not raise enough to cover its \u00a3200m book value. </p> <p>The supermarket group insists that its carefully thought-out new strategy is still running on rails but the \"good news\" extends only to a boast that an improvement in trading has left like-for-like sales down only 5% during the last four weeks. </p> <p>Three months ago Mr Simons admitted: \"I would be foolish if I did not recognise that there has been a loss of management credibility\", and yesterday he conceded that at least some of the supermarket chain's problems were \"internally created\". </p> <p>Self-flagellation may be good for the soul, but just how it enhances shareholder value is somewhat less obvious.</p>",

Setting Labour's funding plans aside, the mere idea of giving the stock market an adrenaline shot in its present state would appear positively Lawsonesque. Decline and fall Rarely in the history of corporate mergers has so much shareholder value been destroyed by so few so quickly. The decline and fall of Somerfield since it merged with Kwik-Save has been brief and, for investors, extremely painful. Sales and profits plummeted as the entire basis of the takeover proved riddled with errors, with the shares collapsing at one stage from 494p to 58p. Last November chief executive David Simons, whose vision landed Somerfield in this situation, announced a new idea - to get rid of half the Kwik-Save stores for which he paid so handsomely but which were now dragging down the rest of the company, sell off up to 144 of Somerfield's biggest supermarkets and concentrate on becoming the finest convenience store group. Three months on, and 45 big stores have been sold - well actually, 19 have been sold and Somerfield has options to sell the other 26. But four in 10 of the big stores have been withdrawn because no buyer is willing to pay the fancy prices demanded. Ultimately, the company conceded yesterday, if the bids being made are not good enough it could be left with seven out of 10 of the big stores it said it wanted to get rid of. Announcing the plan in November Mr Simons said the sell-off would allow Somerfield to \"focus on our core high street retailing skills\". Yet the stores it still hopes to sell are the largest of its out of town shops. Meanwhile there is no sign of a buyer for the burdensome 400-strong Kwik-Save estate, and now the company concedes that it will not raise enough to cover its \u00a3200m book value. The supermarket group insists that its carefully thought-out new strategy is still running on rails but the \"good news\" extends only to a boast that an improvement in trading has left like-for-like sales down only 5% during the last four weeks. Three months ago Mr Simons admitted: \"I would be foolish if I did not recognise that there has been a loss of management credibility\", and yesterday he conceded that at least some of the supermarket chain's problems were \"internally created\". Self-flagellation may be good for the soul, but just how it enhances shareholder value is somewhat less obvious.",
