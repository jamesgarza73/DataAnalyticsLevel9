But when staff cut open its stomach yesterday a man's head rolled out.</p> <p>A co-owner of the factory, Peter Monson, said the head was whole and not badly disfigured. \"There was disbelief. You would never dream of it,\" he said.</p> <p>Detective Sergeant David Miles of Cairns police added: \"The fish was fairly big and the head appeared to be fairly much intact inside it.\"</p> <p>Police removed the fish and the grisly find for forensic examination. They suspect that the head may be that of a local fisherman, Michael Edwards, 39, who disappeared on Sunday after falling from his trawler east of Slashers Reef.</p> <p>Trawlermen were puzzled about how the head could have found its way into the fish's stomach so quickly. Flowery cod, also known as morgan cod, normally suck in their prey and do not have sharp teeth.</p> <p>Cod are voracious migratory fish which normally feed on other fish and invertebrates.

      "bodyText": "A huge cod caught off Australia's Great Barrier Reef revealed a grisly secret after it was landed in Queensland at the weekend. Weighing more than 44kg (97lb) and measuring 5ft 9ins long, the fish - a flowery cod with distinctive blotchy skin - was triumphantly lowered by trawlermen into the ship's hold. The trawler docked in Cairns and the cod was delivered to the Fine Kettle O' Fish filleting factory. But when staff cut open its stomach yesterday a man's head rolled out. A co-owner of the factory, Peter Monson, said the head was whole and not badly disfigured. \"There was disbelief. You would never dream of it,\" he said. Detective Sergeant David Miles of Cairns police added: \"The fish was fairly big and the head appeared to be fairly much intact inside it.\" Police removed the fish and the grisly find for forensic examination. They suspect that the head may be that of a local fisherman, Michael Edwards, 39, who disappeared on Sunday after falling from his trawler east of Slashers Reef. Trawlermen were puzzled about how the head could have found its way into the fish's stomach so quickly. Flowery cod, also known as morgan cod, normally suck in their prey and do not have sharp teeth. Cod are voracious migratory fish which normally feed on other fish and invertebrates. The flowery cod is often described as a shy fish, preferring coral reefs close to shore, but frequently descending to well below 30 metres (100ft). It is found in the Red Sea, Indian Ocean and off Australia's Pacific coast. The Fishing Cairns' website describes the variety of cod species on offer to visiting anglers: \"Humans find a great deal of affection for these seemingly gentle giants, with the game boat skippers and dive boat operators making an event of hand feeding their 'pet' while on charter. The fishes' huge mouths will engulf substantial offerings.\"",

      "body": "<p>It's many years since a new oil exploration and production company was brought to the London stock market but with crude prices continuing to soar it was perhaps inevitable that someone would try. </p> <p>Fusion Oil &amp; Gas, of British and Australian origins, plans an AIM listing plus a placement for \u00a315m next month and hopes to emulate the success of Tullow Oil and Gas. </p> <p>A recent offering to raise \u00a342m by the Irish E&amp;P company on the back of acquiring new North Sea gas producing assets was heavily oversubscribed. And Ramco Energy showed the potential for small players to produce big bucks when it sold interests in Azerbaijan for more than its own capitalisation. </p> <p>Fusion is a different animal from Tullow, concentrating on exploration in speculative regions north of west Africa and some way from the finds of Nigeria and Angola. </p> <p>Fusion's portfolio will be given a boost today with confirmation that it has been awarded the Croix du Sud licence in an area administered by the governments of Senegal and Guinea-Bissau. One of its main plays is Mauritania where it holds virgin offshore acreage and has brought in blue chip names such as Italy's Agip and Woodside Petroleum of Aus tralia. </p> <p>North-west Africa has attracted attention recently because of an onshore find in Morocco and plans by Shell to drill offshore next year. </p> <p>But what else has Fusion got in its locker? The management team comes from a credible oil and gas background. Chairman Peter Dolan was a veteran explorer with Mobil and Ball &amp; Collins (now Premier Oil) before establishing the Ikoda consultancy with Fusion managing director Alan Stein. Exploration director Jonathan Taylor is a former Amerada Hess and Clyde man and there is a smattering of known non-executives from the world of E&amp;P such as Derek Williams, former boss of Charterhall. </p> <p>There is technical expertise here through the work Ikoda undertook for Shell in state-of-the-art areas such as 4D seismic and reservoir engineering. But does all this add up to a sound investment when Fusion comes to market? There is a clear strategy, with technology and management to back it up. </p> <p>But ultimately it all depends on the drill bit. For those who like a touch of the Indiana Jones about their investments then here is an opportunity. The rest of us will be content to cheer from the sidelines.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's many years since a new oil exploration and production company was brought to the London stock market but with crude prices continuing to soar it was perhaps inevitable that someone would try. Fusion Oil &amp; Gas, of British and Australian origins, plans an AIM listing plus a placement for \u00a315m next month and hopes to emulate the success of Tullow Oil and Gas. A recent offering to raise \u00a342m by the Irish E&amp;P company on the back of acquiring new North Sea gas producing assets was heavily oversubscribed. And Ramco Energy showed the potential for small players to produce big bucks when it sold interests in Azerbaijan for more than its own capitalisation. Fusion is a different animal from Tullow, concentrating on exploration in speculative regions north of west Africa and some way from the finds of Nigeria and Angola. Fusion's portfolio will be given a boost today with confirmation that it has been awarded the Croix du Sud licence in an area administered by the governments of Senegal and Guinea-Bissau. One of its main plays is Mauritania where it holds virgin offshore acreage and has brought in blue chip names such as Italy's Agip and Woodside Petroleum of Aus tralia. North-west Africa has attracted attention recently because of an onshore find in Morocco and plans by Shell to drill offshore next year. But what else has Fusion got in its locker? The management team comes from a credible oil and gas background. Chairman Peter Dolan was a veteran explorer with Mobil and Ball &amp; Collins (now Premier Oil) before establishing the Ikoda consultancy with Fusion managing director Alan Stein. Exploration director Jonathan Taylor is a former Amerada Hess and Clyde man and there is a smattering of known non-executives from the world of E&amp;P such as Derek Williams, former boss of Charterhall. There is technical expertise here through the work Ikoda undertook for Shell in state-of-the-art areas such as 4D seismic and reservoir engineering. But does all this add up to a sound investment when Fusion comes to market? There is a clear strategy, with technology and management to back it up. But ultimately it all depends on the drill bit. For those who like a touch of the Indiana Jones about their investments then here is an opportunity. The rest of us will be content to cheer from the sidelines.",

Social realism today really means films that address daily life in a serious fashion; it is a pressing issue in Britain because, in our current leisure-obsessed culture, the working grind has effectively become a taboo. Stephen Daldry's 80s-set Billy Elliott is representative of the way that British film addresses political realities only if they are safely tucked away in the past.

Take next week's release Whatever (Extension du Domaine de la Lutte), which wittily and nastily depicts office life as a pathological nightmare. </p> <p>Another French film released soon is Laurent Cantet's Ressources Humaines (Human Resources). It spins riveting, moving drama out of the most unpromising premise imaginable: the implementation of the 35-hour working week. Cantet's film is a story about the young son of a factory worker, an idealistic young business studies graduate who joins the personnel department of the factory where his father has worked all his life. The plot thickens when the managers use his idealistic suggestions to engineer redundancies. </p> <p>Cantet appears to be dealing with stereotypes: manipulative executives, devious paternalist boss, obstreperous shop steward. What's remarkable is that, with the exception of lead Jalil Lespert, all the film's players really are what they seem. Cantet recruited unemployed workers to play the factory staff; the boss was a real-life boss, and the shop steward a real shop steward. (This is not just a French art-film device: China's Zhang Yimou did much the same in his recent Not One Less.) The factory is a real factory, and it is amazing that Cantet was ever allowed to shoot such a militant project there; in fact, a new boss arrived at the factory shortly after the film was completed and barred Cantet from returning to photograph it for the film's poster. </p> <p>Cantet's trump card is that he not only analyses industrial conflict but analyses it through people and their relation to language. At weekends, they speak the language of bars and the dinner table; but come Monday morning, they fall easily into union rhetoric and the convoluted argot of the French business world. It is a matter not just of wearing suits or overalls, but of wearing your language like a uniform that makes you think and move like a different person. </p> <p>This is shopfloor drama with a touch of Roland Barthes. It is hard to describe Human Resources without making it seem like an arid social-studies tract. Yet Cantet's passionate film makes you re-examine all your preconceptions about what makes film drama involving. The industrial practice of \"annualisation\" may not seem the most promising screen material, but our own cinematic standbys of cheeky gangsters, clubland geezers and lovable young lads look pretty dreary in comparison.</p> <p>Human Resources opens at the National Film Theatre, London SE1 (020-7928 3232), on September 15.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As Tony Blair and his family returned from their summer holiday yesterday, Downing Street signalled a truce in its dispute with the media over intrusion into their private lives. Despite the Blairs' attempts to enjoy a low-key vacation, their three-week break in France and Italy saw a number of skirmishes with the British and continental media, and repeated threats by Downing Street officials to complain to the press complaints commission over intrusion. Yesterday, only hours before the Blairs arrived home by RAF plane, the prime minister's spokesman indicated that no further complaints were planned and insisted that the press coverage of the holiday had been \"by and large... problem free\". Asked whether Mr and Mrs Blair had decided whether to talk to the commission over the publication of unauthorised holiday photographs, their spokesman, Godric Smith, said: \"I am sure it is something that will be looked at, but I do not believe it is at the top of the in-tray.\" The Blairs were understood to be considering a formal complaint over newspaper reports that rowdy behaviour by their 16-year-old son Euan and two friends woke hotel guests on the island of Ponza. The prime minister was also said to be furious at press photographs of his family attending mass in the French village of St Martin-d'Oydes. In a move seen as a sign of rapprochement, Mr Blair's spokesman dismissed the reports about Euan as \"a lot of nonsense\" and said Downing Street had \"taken a relaxed view\" on what had been a \"confusing situation\" in France regarding the taking of unofficial pictures. The comments follow weeks of dispute over what constitutes legitimate press coverage of Tony and Cherie Blair's four children, Euan, Nicky, Kathryn and baby Leo. Lord Wakeham, the commission's chairman, is considering a complaint regarding the coverage given Leo's christening last month despite the Blairs' insistence that it was a private family event. The spokesman said Lord Wakeham would now look at \"the raft of issues\" concerning coverage of the premier's children that had been raised over the summer, including the reports of Euan's arrest last month for being \"drunk and incapable\" in central London.",

      "body": "<p>Two onboard torpedo explosions, the second of them catastrophic, were responsible for sinking the nuclear submarine Kursk, according to US spy submarines and a surface vessel which were monitoring Russian naval exercises in the Barents sea on August 12.</p> <p>According to the American version of events, compiled from sonar tapes and other recordings analysed at the US National Maritime Intelligence Centre, the first explosion took place when a rocket-propelled torpedo misfired during loading or launch, causing the torpedo engine or its fuel to explode.</p> <p>After what the Americans portray as a desperate struggle by the Kursk's captain, Grigory Lyachin, to bring the crippled vessel to the surface, it was devastated two and a quarter minutes later when the torpedo warhead exploded. The second blast tore a huge hole in the bow, killing most of the crew instantly and sending the submarine to the seabed.</p> <p>Within hours of the sinking, this version of the disaster was circulating within the US government, nearly two days before the Russians announced the accident on August 14. The Russians assert that the explosion on the Kursk took place after a collision with a huge object, possibly a submarine or a second world war mine.</p> <p>The US version comes from surveillance data recorded by the nuclear submarine Memphis, which was one of two American submarines spying on the doomed Russian naval exercises. In addition to the two submarines, the US Navy had a surface ship, the Loyal, in the Barents sea as part of its monitoring operation.</p> <p>The Memphis docked in Bergen, Norway, on August 18, six days after the Kursk sank, allowing the American submarine to unload its recordings which were then flown to the US for examination. The US Navy insists that the Memphis was on a scheduled courtesy visit to Norway, and that its arrival in Bergen was not an emergency as a result of a collision, as some Russian reports have suggested.</p> <p>The three vessels detected no indication of a collision involving the Kursk, the Americans say. US naval sources said that the signals from a collision would be easy to distinguish and there was no evidence of such signals in the tapes they have examined.</p> <p>A former submarine officer who is a member of the official Russian commission looking into the cause of the disaster said on Monday that a new weapons systems was being tested on the Kursk when it sank. The officer refused to elaborate further.</p> <p>In addition to their sonar recordings, the US spy ships were able to monitor the Russian fleet's transmissions in the minutes and hours following the disaster.</p> <p>According to an account yesterday, the Americans remained in the area, continuing to gather intelligence and intercepting frantic messages between the Russians as they tried to find out what happened to the Kursk.</p> <p>The American sources say they have found no evidence that any of the 118-strong crew of the Kursk survived the explosions, and they claim their own vessels were not equipped to assist in a rescue.</p> <p>The US Navy refuses to say how close their submarines were to the Kursk at the time of the disaster.

      "bodyText": "Two onboard torpedo explosions, the second of them catastrophic, were responsible for sinking the nuclear submarine Kursk, according to US spy submarines and a surface vessel which were monitoring Russian naval exercises in the Barents sea on August 12. According to the American version of events, compiled from sonar tapes and other recordings analysed at the US National Maritime Intelligence Centre, the first explosion took place when a rocket-propelled torpedo misfired during loading or launch, causing the torpedo engine or its fuel to explode. After what the Americans portray as a desperate struggle by the Kursk's captain, Grigory Lyachin, to bring the crippled vessel to the surface, it was devastated two and a quarter minutes later when the torpedo warhead exploded. The second blast tore a huge hole in the bow, killing most of the crew instantly and sending the submarine to the seabed. Within hours of the sinking, this version of the disaster was circulating within the US government, nearly two days before the Russians announced the accident on August 14. The Russians assert that the explosion on the Kursk took place after a collision with a huge object, possibly a submarine or a second world war mine. The US version comes from surveillance data recorded by the nuclear submarine Memphis, which was one of two American submarines spying on the doomed Russian naval exercises. In addition to the two submarines, the US Navy had a surface ship, the Loyal, in the Barents sea as part of its monitoring operation. The Memphis docked in Bergen, Norway, on August 18, six days after the Kursk sank, allowing the American submarine to unload its recordings which were then flown to the US for examination. The US Navy insists that the Memphis was on a scheduled courtesy visit to Norway, and that its arrival in Bergen was not an emergency as a result of a collision, as some Russian reports have suggested. The three vessels detected no indication of a collision involving the Kursk, the Americans say. US naval sources said that the signals from a collision would be easy to distinguish and there was no evidence of such signals in the tapes they have examined. A former submarine officer who is a member of the official Russian commission looking into the cause of the disaster said on Monday that a new weapons systems was being tested on the Kursk when it sank. The officer refused to elaborate further. In addition to their sonar recordings, the US spy ships were able to monitor the Russian fleet's transmissions in the minutes and hours following the disaster. According to an account yesterday, the Americans remained in the area, continuing to gather intelligence and intercepting frantic messages between the Russians as they tried to find out what happened to the Kursk. The American sources say they have found no evidence that any of the 118-strong crew of the Kursk survived the explosions, and they claim their own vessels were not equipped to assist in a rescue. The US Navy refuses to say how close their submarines were to the Kursk at the time of the disaster. US rules of engagement restrict snooping vessels from going within five miles of their targets. A senior naval officer told the New York Times yesterday that the Americans were \"a long way away\" from the Kursk. Nevertheless, the two US submarines were close enough to the Kursk to feel the underwater impact of the fatal blast, though without suffering any damage themselves. There is no evidence on the US Navy's sonar recordings of the tapping from within the Kursk which was reported by the Russians as late as two days after the sinking. Those reports helped raise hopes for a rescue, but when Norwegian divers finally entered the submarine a week after the disaster, they found none of the its crew alive.",

First-class trip on an oddly punctual Branson train to Crewe, taken by chauffeur to the Rolls-Royce factory to pick up Corniche convertible RR1, open air ride to Leeds, triumphal tour around his native city ... Gerald may have had a broigus with the Guardian, to use the correct Yiddish term, but was it a broigus to survive an outing such as that? I think not.</p> <p>\u0095 Outside the R-R factory, Gerald indulged Jeanette and Sarah from the press office and tour guide John Spragg in a 25-minute analysis of the BBC's structural deficiencies. On seeing the Corniche, however, he broke off to complain: \"It's too small, absurdly pokey, I cannot be expected to travel in a matchbox like that.\" Brightening, he then embarked on a rendition of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang that only ceased when he was invited to take a nap in the boot.</p> <p>\u0095 Warmest thanks to the countless readers who met Gerald, Richard Adams and myself outside Leeds's magnificent town hall - all four of you, if we must count. Among the throng were Gareth and Wendy Frankland.

For seldom, you must suspect, if ever has any robust government loyalist had a treat quite like Friday's. First-class trip on an oddly punctual Branson train to Crewe, taken by chauffeur to the Rolls-Royce factory to pick up Corniche convertible RR1, open air ride to Leeds, triumphal tour around his native city ... Gerald may have had a broigus with the Guardian, to use the correct Yiddish term, but was it a broigus to survive an outing such as that? I think not. \u0095 Outside the R-R factory, Gerald indulged Jeanette and Sarah from the press office and tour guide John Spragg in a 25-minute analysis of the BBC's structural deficiencies. On seeing the Corniche, however, he broke off to complain: \"It's too small, absurdly pokey, I cannot be expected to travel in a matchbox like that.\" Brightening, he then embarked on a rendition of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang that only ceased when he was invited to take a nap in the boot. \u0095 Warmest thanks to the countless readers who met Gerald, Richard Adams and myself outside Leeds's magnificent town hall - all four of you, if we must count. Among the throng were Gareth and Wendy Frankland. Gareth, not so much old Labour as ex-Labour, will be familiar as the man expelled from the party after being reported to high command for referring to Gordon Brown as \"a bastard\" in a pub. \"I've known and fought your type for 40 years,\" said Gerald on being introduced. \"Yes, and won.\" \u0095 Suddenly maudlin, Gerald demanded to go to Middleton, the suburb of his birth, to the school where in 1949 he made an unforgettable stage debut as \"fourth Munchkin\".

      "body": "<p>Teaching unions yesterday warned of the worst recruitment crisis ever to grip British classrooms, with thousands of pupils due to return to understaffed schools next week with no permanent teacher.</p> <p>In London, where the problem is particularly acute, the government yesterday acknowledged the worsening situation by announcing measures to attract more trainees to inner city schools, including a doubling of the number of places for prospective teachers to train \"on the job\" and financial help with housing.</p> <p>The Department for Education and Employment said new figures to be published next month will reveal 1,020 teacher vacancies in London in January this year - the highest on record. The vacancy rate for London is 1.9%, compared with 0.6% for the rest of England.</p> <p>Teachers' leaders warned of the educational damage to children of a constant stream of supply teachers - often from abroad - as a growing number of London boroughs are forced to recruit staff from around the world. Tomorrow more than 20 teachers from Australia will be given a mayoral welcome in Croydon, south London, before starting work in 21 of the borough's primary and secondary schools next week. Other London boroughs such as Greenwich and Hackney are seeking recruits from New Zealand, Canada and Dubai, in order to attract more ethnic minority staff.</p> <p>John Dunford, the general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"The recruitment crisis is the worst we have seen. We are no longer talking about just London, but also Birmingham, Nottingham, Hull and Manchester.</p> <p>\"Hundreds of head teachers are facing the new term with large levels of vacancies, particularly at secondary school in the shortage subjects of maths and modern languages. Questions must be asked about what this does for continuity of education for youngsters, particularly those about to take important exams.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, announcing an extra \u00a34m grant to double the number of places for teachers to train on the job in London without going back to college, the education and employment secretary David Blunkett said: \"We are determined to help schools in the capital fill their vacancies.

      "bodyText": "Teaching unions yesterday warned of the worst recruitment crisis ever to grip British classrooms, with thousands of pupils due to return to understaffed schools next week with no permanent teacher. In London, where the problem is particularly acute, the government yesterday acknowledged the worsening situation by announcing measures to attract more trainees to inner city schools, including a doubling of the number of places for prospective teachers to train \"on the job\" and financial help with housing. The Department for Education and Employment said new figures to be published next month will reveal 1,020 teacher vacancies in London in January this year - the highest on record. The vacancy rate for London is 1.9%, compared with 0.6% for the rest of England. Teachers' leaders warned of the educational damage to children of a constant stream of supply teachers - often from abroad - as a growing number of London boroughs are forced to recruit staff from around the world. Tomorrow more than 20 teachers from Australia will be given a mayoral welcome in Croydon, south London, before starting work in 21 of the borough's primary and secondary schools next week. Other London boroughs such as Greenwich and Hackney are seeking recruits from New Zealand, Canada and Dubai, in order to attract more ethnic minority staff. John Dunford, the general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"The recruitment crisis is the worst we have seen. We are no longer talking about just London, but also Birmingham, Nottingham, Hull and Manchester. \"Hundreds of head teachers are facing the new term with large levels of vacancies, particularly at secondary school in the shortage subjects of maths and modern languages. Questions must be asked about what this does for continuity of education for youngsters, particularly those about to take important exams.\" Yesterday, announcing an extra \u00a34m grant to double the number of places for teachers to train on the job in London without going back to college, the education and employment secretary David Blunkett said: \"We are determined to help schools in the capital fill their vacancies. The package I'm announcing today will make teaching in London a more financially viable propo sition and make more newly-qualified teachers available to teach in the capital\". A returners scheme will also aim to persuade qualified teachers to return to the profession, perhaps after having a family, while teaching staff are to be included in the new \u00a3250m Starter Homes Initiative providing housing help for key public service workers. Ralph Tabberer, chief executive of the teacher training agency, said: \"We're clear that there is a problem in London, but we have a buoyant economy which makes graduate recruitment tough. The new \u00a36,000 training 'salaries' for students starting postgraduate courses in September have led to a huge increase in applications for these courses.\" But David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, com mented: \"It is an absolute scandal that in the year 2000, an advanced industrial country like England should have to go to the old colonies to recruit teachers that we simply can't find from within our own resources because we don't give the profession the recognition it deserves. \"The national picture is worse, London is dire and the south-east is extremely difficult.

Kevin McGuigan, 45, former senior medical officer at Parkhurst prison on the Isle of Wight, was imprisoned for 15 months for assault causing actual bodily harm and for firearms offences. The doctor, who is understood to have treated some of Britain's most notorious killers during his time in the prison service, where his salary was \u00a370,000 a year, was initially sent to Winchester prison. But he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act and is now being treated at the \u00a32,500 a week Priory hospital at Marchwood, Hampshire, where the footballers Paul Merson and Paul Gascoigne, the entertainer Michael Barrymore and the model Kate Moss have been patients in the past. The hospital is one of 27 specialist units operated by the privately run Priory group. Its rooms, each for a single patient, have television and video and en suite bathroom, and its 10 acres of grounds include a swimming pool. It treats patients with a wide range of psychiatric conditions, including addictions, stress and obsessive compulsive disorders.

He broke down the bedroom door, threw her on to the bed and hit her. On another occasion he threw her to the ground, hit her in the face and kicked her. When Mrs McGuigan called police, they discovered a small arsenal of illegal weapons, including a pump-action shotgun and a sawn-off shotgun, the court heard. They also found a wallet embossed with the logo of the loyalist Ulster Defence Force.",

When these houses were built there was no mention of having to pay to go across the common.\"</p> <p>Louise Smith and her husband, David, claimed that they had had a \u00a3500,000 offer on their property, Oaktree farm, withdrawn after a prospective buyer learned that a \u00a360,000 right of access payment was required.</p> <p>The couple had received a letter telling them that they, or the new owners, needed permission to drive up a 50 yard track that leads from the lane to their house.</p> <p>\"The issue has never been raised before and, after nine years in the house, we are stunned,\" she said. \"It would be bad enough if the demand came from a private landlord, but this is our own parish council.</p> <p>\"The council chairman, David Clark, won't discuss the policy and sends back my letters marked 'return to sender'. The solicitors just quote the law at me.\" No one at the parish council's solicitors, Edward and Harris and Son in Swansea, was available for comment yesterday.</p> <p>John Maples, Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon, said: \"It is inappropriate for any landowner to exercise his rights in this way, let alone a council which exists for the good of the people. I do see the council's position. It is being advised that it must extract best value from its assets. But the government has made it clear that this does not mean it has to squeeze the last cent. [The parish council's] refusal even to discuss the situation seems unreasonable. I do think it is being very greedy.\"</p> <p>Mr Maples is due to meet representatives of the council next month to try to resolve the problem.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of the Environment said yesterday: \"Ministers have expressed sympathy. However, charging for this permission is quite legal. We are looking carefully at the complex legal issues, and will return to the subject when the countryside and rights of way bill is debated in the Lords in September.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "For the householders on Yarningale common - 40 acres of meadow, forest and scrub - life was sweet, an idyll of spectacular vistas, lazy walks and rural quiet. That was until their parish council asked them each to pay up to \u00a360,000 for the right to drive up to their homes. Claverdon parish council in Warwickshire is demanding fees for permission to drive across the parish common up to the front doors of 17 homes, some of which are worth hundreds of thousands of pounds; already one prospective sale is said to have fallen through as a consequence. The parish said it wanted to \"regularise\" vehicular access, but declined to discuss the issue further; if all 17 were to pay up, Claverdon would receive \u00a3500,000, making it possibly the wealthiest parish in the country. Corinne Mitchell, who lives close to the common, is leading opposition to the charges, even though she is not one of those who would have to pay. \"What is so annoying is that everything has been done in secret,\" she said yesterday. \"If we ask questions of the parish council about the common, they refuse to answer them. \"My husband's family have lived in the area for 200 years, and we feel it is morally wrong and unreasonable to have our commoners' rights extinguished by the council.\" Yarningale common was given to the village in 1950 by Leftbridge Galton, the lord of the manor, but it was effectively taken over and managed by the council. Mrs Mitchell said many villagers were angry because a small section of the community was being asked to fork out vast sums to access the common. \"It seems so unjust and the council is being very greedy and uncooperative,\" she said. \"People are pretty mad about it.\" She commented that the legislation the council was using was designed to prevent people driving over common land, not to stop them getting to their homes. Jim Storey lives at Oak Cottage, a property that is more than 400 years old. \"I am quite sure that a horse and cart would have been allowed to come across the land without too much trouble,\" he said. \"This has suddenly been dropped on us by the council.\" He said another homeowner had been told that they would have to pay many thousands of pounds to access their property - which cuts across a tiny strip of the common. Another resident said: \"It is ridiculous that people living here who rely on access will have to pay for that privilege. When these houses were built there was no mention of having to pay to go across the common.\" Louise Smith and her husband, David, claimed that they had had a \u00a3500,000 offer on their property, Oaktree farm, withdrawn after a prospective buyer learned that a \u00a360,000 right of access payment was required. The couple had received a letter telling them that they, or the new owners, needed permission to drive up a 50 yard track that leads from the lane to their house. \"The issue has never been raised before and, after nine years in the house, we are stunned,\" she said. \"It would be bad enough if the demand came from a private landlord, but this is our own parish council. \"The council chairman, David Clark, won't discuss the policy and sends back my letters marked 'return to sender'. The solicitors just quote the law at me.\" No one at the parish council's solicitors, Edward and Harris and Son in Swansea, was available for comment yesterday. John Maples, Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon, said: \"It is inappropriate for any landowner to exercise his rights in this way, let alone a council which exists for the good of the people. I do see the council's position. It is being advised that it must extract best value from its assets. But the government has made it clear that this does not mean it has to squeeze the last cent. [The parish council's] refusal even to discuss the situation seems unreasonable. I do think it is being very greedy.\" Mr Maples is due to meet representatives of the council next month to try to resolve the problem. A spokesman for the Department of the Environment said yesterday: \"Ministers have expressed sympathy. However, charging for this permission is quite legal. We are looking carefully at the complex legal issues, and will return to the subject when the countryside and rights of way bill is debated in the Lords in September.\"",

Telomerase is found in all major cancers. </p> <p>The classic cancer treatments, by radiation, surgery or drugs, are uncertain and often wretched for the patient. </p> <p>Researchers have begun to pin their hopes on genetically-based vaccines as a new way of stopping existing cancers, or preventing cancers from returning. </p> <p>Scientists in Britain have just begun to assemble a library of hundreds of genes specific to different kinds of cancers and these could ultimately be the basis for hundreds of unique treatments. </p> <p>But telomerase has presented scientists with a single target. And a US team based in North Carolina reports in the September issue of Nature Medicine that telomerase could be the basis of a new kind of all-purpose vaccine. </p> <p>\"The thinking has been that because every cancer is different - melanoma, breast etc - that each cancer has its own specific set of antigens that must be used for a vaccine,\" said Eli Gilboa, of the Duke University medical centre. \"We are looking for a universal antigen - one antigen to try to treat every cancer patient.\" </p> <p>Cancer vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to produce an army of cells that recognise, attack and kill specific targets: in this case, cancer cells. The Duke researchers worked with the Geron Corporation, a leading biotech company. They used RNA - the gene's instructions for building proteins - to persuade key cells to make and display a certain part of the telomerase protein on their surfaces. These key cells play a powerful role in kicking the immune system into action. </p> <p>The researchers also made vaccines specific to certain tumours, and compared them to the telomerase vaccine. </p> <p>The tumour-RNA vaccines set up immune responses that were more efficient at killing the tumours. </p> <p>But the telomerase vaccine set up a response that recognised and killed a much wider variety of cancer cells. </p> <p>It slowed the growth of melanoma, breast and bladder cancers in mice, and it was effective against to sets of mouse cancer cells in the laboratory. No other vaccine produced such a broad response. </p> <p>The research has only been in mice, or cells in a laboratory dish. Human tests are a long way off. Cancer researchers in Britain zeroed in on telomerase last year, when they found a way of switching off this \"immortality\" enzyme. Doing this would, in effect, tell a tumour to commit suicide. But it is one thing to propose a magic bullet, quite another thing to make it and fire it accurately at the enemy. </p> <p>\"Teams all over the world are looking at the development of new therapeutics with telomerase as the target. But the vast majority are not looking at it as an immune target. It's a novel approach, \" said Lesley Walker of the Cancer Research Campaign last night. \"Telomerase is not switched on in all cancers, so the claim to universal is a bit rich. But we know what they mean.\" </p> <p>And Nick Lemoine of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund saw other difficulties. Telomerase was certainly present in high levels in tumour cells - but it was also present in the stem cells of bone marrow, reproductive organs and perhaps other tissues. Triggering the immune system to search for and destroy telomerase cells could do more harm than good. </p> <p>\"The idea that it might be possible to create a universal vaccine for all cancers is appealing, but unlikely to be achieved because there are so many different types of cancer,\" he said.</p>",

Telomerase is found in all major cancers. The classic cancer treatments, by radiation, surgery or drugs, are uncertain and often wretched for the patient. Researchers have begun to pin their hopes on genetically-based vaccines as a new way of stopping existing cancers, or preventing cancers from returning. Scientists in Britain have just begun to assemble a library of hundreds of genes specific to different kinds of cancers and these could ultimately be the basis for hundreds of unique treatments. But telomerase has presented scientists with a single target. And a US team based in North Carolina reports in the September issue of Nature Medicine that telomerase could be the basis of a new kind of all-purpose vaccine. \"The thinking has been that because every cancer is different - melanoma, breast etc - that each cancer has its own specific set of antigens that must be used for a vaccine,\" said Eli Gilboa, of the Duke University medical centre. \"We are looking for a universal antigen - one antigen to try to treat every cancer patient.\" Cancer vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to produce an army of cells that recognise, attack and kill specific targets: in this case, cancer cells. The Duke researchers worked with the Geron Corporation, a leading biotech company. They used RNA - the gene's instructions for building proteins - to persuade key cells to make and display a certain part of the telomerase protein on their surfaces. These key cells play a powerful role in kicking the immune system into action. The researchers also made vaccines specific to certain tumours, and compared them to the telomerase vaccine. The tumour-RNA vaccines set up immune responses that were more efficient at killing the tumours. But the telomerase vaccine set up a response that recognised and killed a much wider variety of cancer cells. It slowed the growth of melanoma, breast and bladder cancers in mice, and it was effective against to sets of mouse cancer cells in the laboratory. No other vaccine produced such a broad response. The research has only been in mice, or cells in a laboratory dish. Human tests are a long way off. Cancer researchers in Britain zeroed in on telomerase last year, when they found a way of switching off this \"immortality\" enzyme. Doing this would, in effect, tell a tumour to commit suicide. But it is one thing to propose a magic bullet, quite another thing to make it and fire it accurately at the enemy. \"Teams all over the world are looking at the development of new therapeutics with telomerase as the target. But the vast majority are not looking at it as an immune target. It's a novel approach, \" said Lesley Walker of the Cancer Research Campaign last night. \"Telomerase is not switched on in all cancers, so the claim to universal is a bit rich. But we know what they mean.\" And Nick Lemoine of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund saw other difficulties. Telomerase was certainly present in high levels in tumour cells - but it was also present in the stem cells of bone marrow, reproductive organs and perhaps other tissues. Triggering the immune system to search for and destroy telomerase cells could do more harm than good. \"The idea that it might be possible to create a universal vaccine for all cancers is appealing, but unlikely to be achieved because there are so many different types of cancer,\" he said.",

When he speaks the line: \"that undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns\", he will be thinking of her, and when the \"sweet prince\" grieves for his murdered father, Russell Beale will be experiencing his own grief. The missing person is his mother, the woman who encouraged him to become an actor and never doubted that her son would one day get to play the role he coveted. </p> <p>\"She always said she was certain that I would play Hamlet and that she would be there to see it,\" recalls Russell Beale, now 39. But she won't be. She died of cancer in April, just before he went into rehearsal. Yet he believes she is still with him. On the night before the first preview, Russell Beale had a vivid dream about his mother. \"I told her that I loved her,\" he says happily.</p> <p>All this talk of dead parents and dreams might well set alarm bells ringing at the National. When Daniel Day Lewis was playing Hamlet at the National in the mid eighties he had a breakdown. The nightly experience of seeing the ghost of his fictional father walking the battlements proved too much for the actor, troubled as he was by his unresolved relationship with his own dead father, the poet laureate Cecil Day Lewis. Day Lewis quit the role and hasn't been seen on stage since. </p> <p>Russell Beale admits that there never was a play like Hamlet for making you think about the fundamentals of your relationship with your parents, and that he'd be lying if he said the Day Lewis parallel hadn't crossed his mind. But Russell Beale is made of sterner stuff. For the past few years he has been gluing Trevor Nunn's fragile National Theatre ensemble together with a string of notable performances, including, appropriately, the spin doctor Pangloss in Candide, who believes all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds. While his prettier, sexier, thinner contemporaries such as Ralph Fiennes were flitting off to Hollywood in the late eighties and nineties, he went on slogging it out in Stratford, pushing his way out of the \"comic actor\" box into which he had been shoehorned, and honing his craft as a classical actor. </p> <p>The hard work paid off. He was the best, most vivid Edward II and the most repulsive yet vulnerable Thersites in Troilus and Cressida that I've ever seen. His Richard III, suggested one critic, looked like the \"unhappy result of a one-night stand between P\u00e8re Ubu and Gertrude Stein\", who never got over his own villainy. Even when ambition gets the better of Russell Beale, as when he played Edgar to Robert Stephens's swansong Lear at Stratford, his are quirky, watchable mistakes. </p> <p>Hamlet is the part he has been yearning to play for almost 20 years. He is not going to blow it now. But there never was a play like Hamlet for getting under an actor's skin. \"I never expected it would be so qualitatively different from the experience of playing any other,\" he says. \"But it is. It's like that idea that all philosophy is a postscript to Plato: you come to realise that all plays are a postscript to Hamlet. I've always been slightly baffled when I've heard actors talk about the wonder of playing Hamlet. But I now know what they mean. It is so much to do with being you. Hamlet is Simon Russell Beale, only much more brilliant.\" </p> <p>Even so, this is the Hamlet that nearly got away. The possibility of Russell Beale in the role has been talked about for almost a decade but never came to fruition. This production was originally slated to be directed by Sam Mendes, the man Russell Beale describes as his \"professional soulmate\" and for whom he has given some of his greatest performances, including an Ariel in The Tempest that was a daring piece of casting against physical type. </p> <p>But then Mendes went to Hollywood and made American Beauty, and it soon became clear that the one thing he wouldn't be doing this year was directing Hamlet on the South Bank. He told Russell Beale not to wait for him. \"I understood completely,\" says Russell Beale. Yet it made him wonder yet again why he was so obsessed with the idea of playing Hamlet. \"I kept asking myself would it really matter so much if I didn't.\" But then John Caird, who had directed Russell Beale so successfully in Candide and Money, stepped into the breach. \"I could have held out for Sam, but I knew time was running out for me. I seriously think that this is my last chance of doing Hamlet. I'm 39. I'm not a dashing Alan Rickman figure who can do Hamlet at 45 and get away with it.\" </p> <p>In fact, Caird's romantic sensibility could be the perfect match for Russell Beale's fierce intelligence, and Russell Beale admits that the wait to play the role might prove a bonus. \"If I'd done it 15 years ago I'd have been much more of a show-off about it,\" he says freely. \"I am glad I've already done those more external, cynical roles like Richard III and Iago. Hamlet is much more uncynical. He is bright as a button but he is an innocent about the world and playing him is about playing what goes on internally.\" </p> <p> The mechanics of grief obviously fascinate Russell Beale and perhaps explain his obsession with Hamlet. \"When you lose someone you love,\" he muses, \"life goes on, even though you feel you are losing your marbles.\" Similarly, Hamlet doesn't go instantly insane with grief; he goes to the theatre and chats with his friends. \"I am using playing Hamlet as part of my grieving process for my mum. I miss her desperately and I think of her a lot. But I've not had that great wailing moment that I expected to happen. I just feel like the guy ropes have suddenly gone.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the biggest test will come when he stops playing Hamlet. When the run finally comes to an end next year, he will have achieved a long-cherished ambition, turned 40 and, for the first time in his professional career, will be facing an empty diary. The man who has spent almost all his professional life within the bosom of either the RSC or the National will suddenly be on his own. </p> <p>Despite his success in the TV version of A Dance to the Music of Time, he is not an obvious TV or film actor, and without work in these two media, he can never expect to earn a great deal; while he would love to work at the Donmar or Almeida, he worries about the mortgage payments on his tiny Pimlico flat. </p> <p>But after years in a frock coat, he is aware that it's time to get out and spread his wings. \"I love Shakespeare but I have a feeling that I shouldn't do any more for a bit. I do feel rather jealous of ballet dancers who get roles created for them. That's what I'd really like - to get Patrick Marber or Tom Stoppard to write a really good part for me.\" </p> <p>As we get up to leave the restaurant, he spies Tom Stoppard at a table lunching with the rest of the National board. \"Go on, then,\" I challenge, \"ask him.\" Russell Beale looks abashed. \"Do you really think I should?\" A pause. \"I think I will. Excuse me,\" he says politely, and slips away towards the playwright. </p> <p>A few days later, word comes back that Stoppard might indeed be able to oblige. I hope so. Every good Beale deserves a favour. </p> <p>Hamlet is at the National Theatre, London SE1 (020-7452 3000), from 5 September.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Will Kempe was here, and so were George Bryan and Thomas Pope. Shakespeare's actor colleagues were on the Danish payroll at Kronborg Castle in the summer of 1586 and they must often have talked of their Danish experiences. Shakespeare used their tales to conflate Helsingor, the plot, and Kronborg to create Elsinore - and Hamlet. </p> <p>The National Theatre's touring Hamlet put on a performance of the play in the castle courtyard a couple of weeks ago, on a stage where the only set is a mass of moveable trunks. The Danish audience brought blankets to guard against the evening chill, reinforcing Shakespeare's suggestion that,\"The air bites shrewdly... It is a nipping and an eager air\". </p> <p>Other lines took on a new intensity within these walls: \"Denmark's a prison\" has no resonance with today's mild and benevolent democracy, but it is a different matter in a courtyard, enclosed on all four sides by palace elevations. It feels like a prison exercise yard. </p> <p>Kronborg is a giant statement of military power. It was built to dominate the Oresund Straits in order to levy customs dues, and all traffic lies under the Danish guns. On two sides of the angle overlooking the Sound are the guns, facing north and east. (\"Hamlet ends, says Martin Holmes in his study The Guns of Elsinore, 'with the crash of artillery that stood, in so many Elizabeth minds, for the armed might of Denmark'.\") </p> <p>The gun emplacements are on a terrace, and there is the \"platform\" where the action of Act 1, Scene 1and Act 1, Scenes 4-5 take place (\"upon the platform where we watch,\" says Marcellus). For the Elizabethans, \"platform\" was used to denote a gunsite. It is possible to play those early scenes on the terrace, which is what the National did. </p> <p>Although Kronborg was burned down in 1629, it was rebuilt with a virtually unchanged exterior. The inner arrangements were modifications rather than radical changes to the original. Hence, the Kronborg we see is very close to the Elsinore that Shakespeare incorporated into Hamlet, and the chambers are directly reflected in the play. The \"chapel\", to which the body of Polonius is removed, remains on view, its entrance being off the courtyard, while \"the Queen's Closet,\" as Shakespeare terms it, must be part of what are now called \"the Queen's Rooms\". </p> <p>The most striking interior feature is the Banqueting Hall, or Great Hall. This, one of the largest interiors in Europe, contains many tapestries, portraying Danish royalty, for which Kronborg was famous. Polonius, in hiding behind the \"arras\" - the word is thrice mentioned - is taking advantage of the space between the hanging screen of tapestry and the wall.Then there is the sea, just yards away from the castle. The flat shore of the Straits is not like the rock-girt coast that Horatio invokes, \"the dreadful summit of the cliff/That beetles o'er his base into the sea\". But \"the dawn, with russet mantle clad,\" really appears, so as one looks towards \"yon high eastward hill\". The Swedish coastline looks higher under the rising sun. A touch of dramatic exaggeration does not come amiss. At all events, Shakespeare depicts a view from the battlements that faces east, over the Sound. And so it does. </p> <p>Kronborg Castle is a massive stage direction that energises line after line and the National players managed to adapt a touring production to the needs of a courtyard performance. The outdoor staging picks up the atmosphere of Hamlet's \"Tis now the very witching time of night\", and when Claudius says, \"the bark is ready and the wind at help\", one senses the busy port life of Helsingor, a couple of hundred yards away. The great play has come home.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Will Kempe was here, and so were George Bryan and Thomas Pope. Shakespeare's actor colleagues were on the Danish payroll at Kronborg Castle in the summer of 1586 and they must often have talked of their Danish experiences. Shakespeare used their tales to conflate Helsingor, the plot, and Kronborg to create Elsinore - and Hamlet. The National Theatre's touring Hamlet put on a performance of the play in the castle courtyard a couple of weeks ago, on a stage where the only set is a mass of moveable trunks. The Danish audience brought blankets to guard against the evening chill, reinforcing Shakespeare's suggestion that,\"The air bites shrewdly... It is a nipping and an eager air\". Other lines took on a new intensity within these walls: \"Denmark's a prison\" has no resonance with today's mild and benevolent democracy, but it is a different matter in a courtyard, enclosed on all four sides by palace elevations. It feels like a prison exercise yard. Kronborg is a giant statement of military power. It was built to dominate the Oresund Straits in order to levy customs dues, and all traffic lies under the Danish guns. On two sides of the angle overlooking the Sound are the guns, facing north and east. (\"Hamlet ends, says Martin Holmes in his study The Guns of Elsinore, 'with the crash of artillery that stood, in so many Elizabeth minds, for the armed might of Denmark'.\") The gun emplacements are on a terrace, and there is the \"platform\" where the action of Act 1, Scene 1and Act 1, Scenes 4-5 take place (\"upon the platform where we watch,\" says Marcellus). For the Elizabethans, \"platform\" was used to denote a gunsite. It is possible to play those early scenes on the terrace, which is what the National did. Although Kronborg was burned down in 1629, it was rebuilt with a virtually unchanged exterior. The inner arrangements were modifications rather than radical changes to the original. Hence, the Kronborg we see is very close to the Elsinore that Shakespeare incorporated into Hamlet, and the chambers are directly reflected in the play. The \"chapel\", to which the body of Polonius is removed, remains on view, its entrance being off the courtyard, while \"the Queen's Closet,\" as Shakespeare terms it, must be part of what are now called \"the Queen's Rooms\". The most striking interior feature is the Banqueting Hall, or Great Hall. This, one of the largest interiors in Europe, contains many tapestries, portraying Danish royalty, for which Kronborg was famous. Polonius, in hiding behind the \"arras\" - the word is thrice mentioned - is taking advantage of the space between the hanging screen of tapestry and the wall.Then there is the sea, just yards away from the castle. The flat shore of the Straits is not like the rock-girt coast that Horatio invokes, \"the dreadful summit of the cliff/That beetles o'er his base into the sea\". But \"the dawn, with russet mantle clad,\" really appears, so as one looks towards \"yon high eastward hill\". The Swedish coastline looks higher under the rising sun. A touch of dramatic exaggeration does not come amiss. At all events, Shakespeare depicts a view from the battlements that faces east, over the Sound. And so it does. Kronborg Castle is a massive stage direction that energises line after line and the National players managed to adapt a touring production to the needs of a courtyard performance. The outdoor staging picks up the atmosphere of Hamlet's \"Tis now the very witching time of night\", and when Claudius says, \"the bark is ready and the wind at help\", one senses the busy port life of Helsingor, a couple of hundred yards away. The great play has come home.",

A songwriter, studio innovator, bluesman, crooner and slide guitar ace, George was one of rock's most brilliant stars. He always surpassed the supposed limitations of rock music; Jackson Browne described him as \"the Orson Welles of rock\". </p> <p>Now George is getting a memorial of sorts, in the form of a four-disc box set on Rhino records, Hotcakes &amp; Outtakes: 30 Years of Little Feat. The package is not an unmixed blessing. An entire disc is devoted to the band's mediocre post-George output, and the compilers should be lowered into boiling oil for some of the glaring omissions from the Feat's first four Warner Brothers albums. But at least the collection is a valuable reminder of George's oblique genius, with a disc of outtakes, demos and alternative versions that throw new light on George and his working methods. </p> <p>Featophiles will also be intrigued by the anecdote-crammed essay by former Rolling Stone writer Bud Scoppa. However, Scoppa strikes a bum note when he seeks to equate the present-day Feat with the original article. Today's band is \"a tribe, a touchstone, a system, a sanctuary, an ongoing act of affirmation,\" he blathers tearfully, when he must know it is only a sorry pastiche of its former glories. </p> <p>Lowell George welded a penetrating intelligence to a deadpan humour. An absurdist's view of the world is a running theme through his songs, from the dazed freaks-against-the-world saga of Strawberry Flats (from the debut album) to Rocket in My Pocket (from 1977's Time Loves a Hero). He could Lowellise other people's songs too, for example with his droll rendition of the Leiber &amp; Stoller tune Framed, or the previously unheard take of Allen Toussaint's Brickyard Blues, which is one of the great discoveries on the Rhino box. </p> <p>Writer and arranger Van Dyke Parks first met George when he was an employee at Warner Brothers and Little Feat came looking for a record deal. \"I think he had the audacity of a schizophrenic, which I associate with great work, whether it's Van Gogh or Ravel,\" Parks observes. \"I think Lowell had a madness in his work that he wanted to explore, and he had the integrity to do it.\" Parks singles out the song Fat Man in the Bathtub. \"You see the physical comedy in Lowell George that you get from Buster Keaton. It's the tragicomedy of man in crisis - that's what Lowell did for me.\" </p> <p>George's colourful background appears to have given him the confidence to pursue his particular vision, oblivious to the incomprehension of onlookers. He was steeped in Hollywood history and folklore, as anyone might be if their family home was just up the hill from Grauman's Chinese Theater. His father was a furrier who numbered many of the movieland aristocracy among his clientele, and went duck-shooting with Tinseltown veterans such as Wallace Beery and WC Fields. Although prone to weight problems, Lowell, sputtering around the Hollywood hills in a battered Morgan sports car, projected a magnetic charm that worked equally well on record companies, women and equipment suppliers. </p> <p>While his brother Hampton joined the paratroopers and went to Vietnam, Lowell studied martial arts and a variety of instruments, including the shakuhachi (a Japanese flute) and the saxophone. Another of the early rarities exhumed by Rhino is a rare and frankly dismal piece called Jazz Thing in 10, in which George tries to be Archie Shepp on sax. </p> <p>The point, however, is that behind the skewed vision of Little Feat's songs lay some unusually advanced musicianship. George served for a time with Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention. The first version of Little Feat - almost named Lyle Gleep - included Mothers bassist Roy Estrada alongside classically trained pianist Bill Payne, with whom George had briefly played in the Brotherhood of Man, the same place he found the Feat's long-serving drummer, Richie Hayward. The Mark 2 Little Feat, who debuted on 1973's Dixie Chicken, saw the arrival of guitarist Barrere, grandson of a famous flautist who taught at the Juilliard School in New York, plus bassist Kenny Gradney and percussionist Sam Clayton, a pair of seasoned R'n'B veterans. </p> <p>George's infuriating stubbornness was as great as his talent. His made his fellow musicians bristle by adopting Frank Zappa's autocratic bandleading style; his eccentric methods of writing and recording, meanwhile, were time-consuming and calamitously costly. The results, at least, were worth it. Rock and Roll Doctor, the opening track from 1974's Feats Don't Fail Me Now, took an age to complete because the band had to build it from a crude demo George had assembled by splicing together chunks of several different cassette tapes. George's objective was to create a song with as many awkward chord changes and rhythmic eccentricities as possible, what he liked to call the \"cracked mosaic\". Its crowning glory is George's slide guitar solo, a screaming miracle of sonic architecture. </p> <p> George's approach to his work often seemed to have more in common with jazz or classical composition: he would spend years reworking the same material, edging his way towards some imagined ideal result. The process was already evident in Little Feat's existing catalogue. The Rhino box offers several more specimens, with very early versions of The Fan, Easy to Fall (which became Easy to Slip on Sailin' Shoes), Texas Rose Cafe and a raw demo of Two Trains, featuring just George and his crude Donca Matic drum machine. It's a testament to their commercial unworldliness that the band left so many excellent tracks off their original albums. Versions of High Roller and All That You Dream from the new collection are decisively superior to the previously issued takes. Lowell's widow Elizabeth discovered the tapes of Lonesome Whistle, issued on the 1981 Hoy-Hoy! compilation, at the back of their garage in a brown paper bag. </p> <p>George was at his creative peak at a time when rock bands were still allowed to make outrageous records, and in Warner Brothers Little Feat found a label that gave its artists more creative rope than most. He also fell foul of the post-psychedelic lifestyle considered desirable in the 1970s, when etiquette dictated that one should be permanently blasted. His fondness for cocaine-and-heroin \"speedballs\" was notorious, his appetite for junk food and liquor unassuagable. An Australian journalist told me how he had interviewed Lowell over lunch in Sydney, during which George put away a bottle of Courvoisier. When he died in June 1979, aged 34, he had ballooned to an Elvis-like 22 stone and was a medical emergency waiting to happen. His attitude towards the brain-dead, body-beautiful record business of the 21st century would not be hard to imagine. </p> <p>Rhino Records release the Hotcakes &amp; Outtakes box set next month.</p>",

Another of the early rarities exhumed by Rhino is a rare and frankly dismal piece called Jazz Thing in 10, in which George tries to be Archie Shepp on sax. The point, however, is that behind the skewed vision of Little Feat's songs lay some unusually advanced musicianship. George served for a time with Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention. The first version of Little Feat - almost named Lyle Gleep - included Mothers bassist Roy Estrada alongside classically trained pianist Bill Payne, with whom George had briefly played in the Brotherhood of Man, the same place he found the Feat's long-serving drummer, Richie Hayward. The Mark 2 Little Feat, who debuted on 1973's Dixie Chicken, saw the arrival of guitarist Barrere, grandson of a famous flautist who taught at the Juilliard School in New York, plus bassist Kenny Gradney and percussionist Sam Clayton, a pair of seasoned R'n'B veterans. George's infuriating stubbornness was as great as his talent. His made his fellow musicians bristle by adopting Frank Zappa's autocratic bandleading style; his eccentric methods of writing and recording, meanwhile, were time-consuming and calamitously costly. The results, at least, were worth it. Rock and Roll Doctor, the opening track from 1974's Feats Don't Fail Me Now, took an age to complete because the band had to build it from a crude demo George had assembled by splicing together chunks of several different cassette tapes. George's objective was to create a song with as many awkward chord changes and rhythmic eccentricities as possible, what he liked to call the \"cracked mosaic\". Its crowning glory is George's slide guitar solo, a screaming miracle of sonic architecture. George's approach to his work often seemed to have more in common with jazz or classical composition: he would spend years reworking the same material, edging his way towards some imagined ideal result. The process was already evident in Little Feat's existing catalogue. The Rhino box offers several more specimens, with very early versions of The Fan, Easy to Fall (which became Easy to Slip on Sailin' Shoes), Texas Rose Cafe and a raw demo of Two Trains, featuring just George and his crude Donca Matic drum machine. It's a testament to their commercial unworldliness that the band left so many excellent tracks off their original albums. Versions of High Roller and All That You Dream from the new collection are decisively superior to the previously issued takes. Lowell's widow Elizabeth discovered the tapes of Lonesome Whistle, issued on the 1981 Hoy-Hoy! compilation, at the back of their garage in a brown paper bag. George was at his creative peak at a time when rock bands were still allowed to make outrageous records, and in Warner Brothers Little Feat found a label that gave its artists more creative rope than most. He also fell foul of the post-psychedelic lifestyle considered desirable in the 1970s, when etiquette dictated that one should be permanently blasted. His fondness for cocaine-and-heroin \"speedballs\" was notorious, his appetite for junk food and liquor unassuagable. An Australian journalist told me how he had interviewed Lowell over lunch in Sydney, during which George put away a bottle of Courvoisier. When he died in June 1979, aged 34, he had ballooned to an Elvis-like 22 stone and was a medical emergency waiting to happen. His attitude towards the brain-dead, body-beautiful record business of the 21st century would not be hard to imagine. Rhino Records release the Hotcakes &amp; Outtakes box set next month.",

      "body": "<p>Mae West was right about most things in life, but when she said \"a hard man is good to find\" she had clearly never met Charles Bronson, or any of his ilk. Bronson - Michael Peterson to his friends, if he has any - is, according to last night's profile, <strong> Britain's Hardest Man</strong> (Channel 5). In a crackly interview recorded a few years ago at Hull Prison, he claimed \"I've done nothing to be ashamed of. I'm a criminal, and proud of it.\" </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, even the most sympathetic prison governors decided there was nothing that could be done for Bronson - and that was before he took a teacher hostage and started demanding a helicopter to Cuba. This little escapade was captured on CCTV, adding a hilarious new dimension to the \"you've been framed\" genre of cheap television. Bronson paced his cell, looking, according to his captive, like \"Fred Flintstone on ecstasy\", brandishing a home-made spear. Now he's locked up for good, or at least till 2010, by which time he will doubtless have done something else to ensure his continued incarceration. There was some talk of the system having \"failed\" Charles Bronson, but if anything the story was one of outstanding success. Bronson has achieved 26 years of almost continuous porridge - not bad for a botched armed robbery. We were left with the unavoidable conclusion that this is what he wants. </p> <p>How the producers of <strong> Smart Hearts</strong> (Channel 4) must have kicked themselves when they woke up to the fact that Big Brother had stolen their thunder. In the first of four episodes we were introduced to artist Brendan, his spurned wife Claire, and new girlfriend Lisa, who unaccountably agreed to have their messy private lives recorded for all to tut over. Webcams and hand-held video allowed us to see far more than we could ever have wished, particularly of the married couple, of whom the kindest that can be said is that they richly deserved each other. </p> <p>Artist Brendan, a loose-featured, wet-mouthed blond, sank into a morass of boozy self-pity, occasionally lashing out and generally acting up for the cameras. Model Claire looked like Faye Dunaway at her most severe, and kept telling us how glad she was that Brendan had dumped her. Lisa sensibly kept out of range, but lost any shred of sympathy by agreeing to marry Brendan at the end of the programme. </p> <p>What should have been entertaining voyeurism - what, after all, is juicier than someone else's romantic disasters? - became, after ten minutes, grim and repetitive. Eight weeks flashed by in half an hour, and we were no nearer resolution; how on earth director Victoria Mapplebeck endured six months with this gruesome threesome boggles the imagination. </p> <p>Erotic triangles abounded in <strong> EastEnders</strong> (BBC1), which started off with the boys at one end of the playground, the girls at the other, before exploring a number of variations. Peggy, Pat and Irene basked in the Spanish sun, looking for all the world like Bananarama in the autumn of their years. They sighed and pined over their marital problems, ignoring the obvious solution in the shape of three nubile toyboys playing volleyball nearby. Instead of dragging them off to some cool caba\u00f1a, they paired up in the most disastrous ways imaginable. </p> <p>Pat encountered Frank by the poolside, and if there was any doubt as to the outcome we heard R Kelly crooning If I Could Turn Back The Hands Of Time on the radio. Minutes later the hands had been well and truly turned back, and the guilty ex-marrieds could only await the discovery that faces all soap adulterers. Peggy, in Chanel shades and a Sophia Loren headscarf, teetered around Alicante with Irene, picking up dodgy blokes, drinking them under the table and pretending to be a lesbian. </p> <p>\"Frank's the one for me\", she confided, little knowing that the man of her choice was getting Pat on her back. Irene, meanwhile, began to realise that there might be more to life than Terry, and gazed wistfully across a landscape of beach umbrellas and overstuffed swimwear. \"I want a fresh start\", she said, speaking, as she often does at moments of crisis, through her nose. Terry, in a moment of freak articulacy, claimed that \"I can't visualise any part of my life that doesn't include you.\" I'd start visualising pretty hard if I were you, Tel, my old son.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mae West was right about most things in life, but when she said \"a hard man is good to find\" she had clearly never met Charles Bronson, or any of his ilk. Bronson - Michael Peterson to his friends, if he has any - is, according to last night's profile, Britain's Hardest Man (Channel 5). In a crackly interview recorded a few years ago at Hull Prison, he claimed \"I've done nothing to be ashamed of. I'm a criminal, and proud of it.\" Unsurprisingly, even the most sympathetic prison governors decided there was nothing that could be done for Bronson - and that was before he took a teacher hostage and started demanding a helicopter to Cuba. This little escapade was captured on CCTV, adding a hilarious new dimension to the \"you've been framed\" genre of cheap television. Bronson paced his cell, looking, according to his captive, like \"Fred Flintstone on ecstasy\", brandishing a home-made spear. Now he's locked up for good, or at least till 2010, by which time he will doubtless have done something else to ensure his continued incarceration. There was some talk of the system having \"failed\" Charles Bronson, but if anything the story was one of outstanding success. Bronson has achieved 26 years of almost continuous porridge - not bad for a botched armed robbery. We were left with the unavoidable conclusion that this is what he wants. How the producers of Smart Hearts (Channel 4) must have kicked themselves when they woke up to the fact that Big Brother had stolen their thunder. In the first of four episodes we were introduced to artist Brendan, his spurned wife Claire, and new girlfriend Lisa, who unaccountably agreed to have their messy private lives recorded for all to tut over. Webcams and hand-held video allowed us to see far more than we could ever have wished, particularly of the married couple, of whom the kindest that can be said is that they richly deserved each other. Artist Brendan, a loose-featured, wet-mouthed blond, sank into a morass of boozy self-pity, occasionally lashing out and generally acting up for the cameras. Model Claire looked like Faye Dunaway at her most severe, and kept telling us how glad she was that Brendan had dumped her. Lisa sensibly kept out of range, but lost any shred of sympathy by agreeing to marry Brendan at the end of the programme. What should have been entertaining voyeurism - what, after all, is juicier than someone else's romantic disasters? - became, after ten minutes, grim and repetitive. Eight weeks flashed by in half an hour, and we were no nearer resolution; how on earth director Victoria Mapplebeck endured six months with this gruesome threesome boggles the imagination. Erotic triangles abounded in EastEnders (BBC1), which started off with the boys at one end of the playground, the girls at the other, before exploring a number of variations. Peggy, Pat and Irene basked in the Spanish sun, looking for all the world like Bananarama in the autumn of their years. They sighed and pined over their marital problems, ignoring the obvious solution in the shape of three nubile toyboys playing volleyball nearby. Instead of dragging them off to some cool caba\u00f1a, they paired up in the most disastrous ways imaginable. Pat encountered Frank by the poolside, and if there was any doubt as to the outcome we heard R Kelly crooning If I Could Turn Back The Hands Of Time on the radio. Minutes later the hands had been well and truly turned back, and the guilty ex-marrieds could only await the discovery that faces all soap adulterers. Peggy, in Chanel shades and a Sophia Loren headscarf, teetered around Alicante with Irene, picking up dodgy blokes, drinking them under the table and pretending to be a lesbian. \"Frank's the one for me\", she confided, little knowing that the man of her choice was getting Pat on her back. Irene, meanwhile, began to realise that there might be more to life than Terry, and gazed wistfully across a landscape of beach umbrellas and overstuffed swimwear. \"I want a fresh start\", she said, speaking, as she often does at moments of crisis, through her nose. Terry, in a moment of freak articulacy, claimed that \"I can't visualise any part of my life that doesn't include you.\" I'd start visualising pretty hard if I were you, Tel, my old son.",

Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement, a longstanding friend and ally of the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, stood down as interior minister in a move that could throw the ruling Socialist-led coalition badly off balance. He said his departure was \"the logical consequence\" of a profound disagreement with Mr Jospin over plans to offer limited autonomy to Corsica. He will be replaced by the government spokesman and minister for parliamentary relations, Daniel Vaillant, who managed the prime minister's 1997 election campaign. Ahead of local polls next year and presidential and parliamentary elections in 2002, Mr Chev\u00e8nement's resignation deprives Mr Jospin not only of one of his most popular ministers but of a key component in the loose leftwing coalition of socialists, greens, communists and radical republicans that has run France for three years. Mr Chev\u00e8nement's departure leaves the radical Mouvement des Citoyens, without a voice in government and could increase cabinet tensions between traditional leftwingers and the reformist finance minister, Laurent Fabius. \"It is a source of great regret that he has decided to go,\" said one Socialist MEP, Marie-No\u00eblle Lienemann. \"I think Jean-Pierre's voice was more useful inside the government than outside, particularly as an expression of republican thought which he is not alone in espousing.\" Mr Jospin has now lost four of the heavyweight ministers he appointed to his first 1997 cabinet through resignations. In a brief but warm statement, the prime minister expressed his regret at the minister's departure and praised his efforts over the past three years. Mr Chev\u00e8nement, an outspoken radical republican, has warned for several months that Mr Jospin's proposal for limited self-rule for Corsica would inevitably lead to the break-up of the Republic. But while politicians praised Mr Chev\u00e8nement as a man of principle, the influential newspaper Le Monde criticised the basis of his stance on Corsica, saying Britain had made progress in Northern Ireland by opening talks without preconditions. The paper also said Mr Chev\u00e8nement was hiding his real ambitions. \"He is leaving because he would like to be the spokesman, if not the presidential candidate, of a large strain of opinion on the right and the left which does not feel comfortable with the economic and European choices of today's France,\" it said. The maverick: Chev\u00e8nement's record At the heart of the French left for nearly 40 years, Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement has managed to remain a man apart. His Mouvement des Citoyens is the contemporary expression of Jacobinism, a philosophy espoused by a small club of 18th-century French republicans who believed in a centralised democracy. Believing that France's national integrity and the unity of the Republic should override any European or international ties, he has argued ferociously against European monetary union, and has attacked the devolution plans for Corsica, declaring that \"one cannot fight against ethnic nationalism in the Balkans and allow it on French soil\". His two ministerial resignations on matters of principle have won him widespread respect, and he remains highly popular. A narrow escape from death in 1998, when he went into a coma after a routine gall-bladder operation, led to his being dubbed \"the miraculous survivor of the Republic\".

      "body": "<p>The hostage crisis in the southern Philippines took a fresh twist yesterday when the Muslim separatist kidnappers seized a young American man they accused of being a spy just as it appeared they were about to release the last remaining six foreign prisoners.</p> <p>As six westerners freed this week after more than four months in captivity celebrated in Tripoli with the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, who facilitated their release by paying a $1m (\u00a3680,000) ransom per captive , the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas announced they had captured Jeffrey Schilling, who had been staying with his Filipino girlfriend in the southern city of Zamboanga.</p> <p>Rebel spokesman Abu Sabaya said in a radio interview that Mr Schilling, 24, from San Francisco, had contacted Abu Sayyaf members in Zamboanga, on Mindanao island, saying he was a Muslim convert and wanted to visit the rebels' local camp.</p> <p>But the separatists, a splinter group of the main Abu Sayyaf force, suspected he was a CIA agent when it transpired he knew little about Islam. So they abducted him and took him to the main Abu Sayyaf stronghold on the island of Jolo, 30 miles southwest of Zamboanga, Mr Sabaya said.</p> <p>There they are still holding six foreigners and 12 Filipino evangelists who were captured when they went into the Jolo jungle to pray for the hostages.</p> <p>Mr Sabaya appeared to be gloating. \"We have been trying very hard to get an American because the Americans may think we are afraid of them,\" he said. \"[Those holding him] will not hesitate to execute this American guy if the Philippine government and the US will not listen to our demands.\"</p> <p>The rebels will announce their demands in three days, he said. It is thought they will include the release of several Arab terrorists imprisoned in US jails. Earlier this year Abu Sayyaf killed two Filipinos they had seized after the Americans refused to release several terrorists.</p> <p>Six officials from the US embassy in Manila flew to Zamboanga yesterday to investigate the incident.</p> <p>Mr Schilling's girlfriend, Ivi Osani, who is also a Muslim, gave a different version of the abduction. She said Mr Sabaya, who is related to her mother, had been pressurising the couple to visit the rebels on Jolo. They finally agreed, and went by boat from Zamboanga on Sunday, she said.</p> <p>Unable to hold back her tears, Ms Osani said Mr Schilling had told her to return alone to Zamboanga, and she had not discovered until her arrival on Tuesday that he had been kidnapped.</p> <p>The Philippine government's chief negotiator, Robert Aventajado, insisted that Mr Schilling's capture had nothing to do with the payment of $6m for the release of the six prisoners this week and $5.5m for 10 others freed in July.</p> <p>\"It is not open season on kidnapping of tourists now,\" he said. \"From what I heard the American was seized because he made the Abu Sayyaf angry by asking too many suspicious questions.\"</p> <p>Rajab Azzarouq, the leading Libyan intermediary in the negotiations, denied that the money had been paid directly to Abu Sayyaf, saying: \"We gave the money to the local people for humanitarian projects, economic projects and social projects.

      "bodyText": "The hostage crisis in the southern Philippines took a fresh twist yesterday when the Muslim separatist kidnappers seized a young American man they accused of being a spy just as it appeared they were about to release the last remaining six foreign prisoners. As six westerners freed this week after more than four months in captivity celebrated in Tripoli with the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, who facilitated their release by paying a $1m (\u00a3680,000) ransom per captive , the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas announced they had captured Jeffrey Schilling, who had been staying with his Filipino girlfriend in the southern city of Zamboanga. Rebel spokesman Abu Sabaya said in a radio interview that Mr Schilling, 24, from San Francisco, had contacted Abu Sayyaf members in Zamboanga, on Mindanao island, saying he was a Muslim convert and wanted to visit the rebels' local camp. But the separatists, a splinter group of the main Abu Sayyaf force, suspected he was a CIA agent when it transpired he knew little about Islam. So they abducted him and took him to the main Abu Sayyaf stronghold on the island of Jolo, 30 miles southwest of Zamboanga, Mr Sabaya said. There they are still holding six foreigners and 12 Filipino evangelists who were captured when they went into the Jolo jungle to pray for the hostages. Mr Sabaya appeared to be gloating. \"We have been trying very hard to get an American because the Americans may think we are afraid of them,\" he said. \"[Those holding him] will not hesitate to execute this American guy if the Philippine government and the US will not listen to our demands.\" The rebels will announce their demands in three days, he said. It is thought they will include the release of several Arab terrorists imprisoned in US jails. Earlier this year Abu Sayyaf killed two Filipinos they had seized after the Americans refused to release several terrorists. Six officials from the US embassy in Manila flew to Zamboanga yesterday to investigate the incident. Mr Schilling's girlfriend, Ivi Osani, who is also a Muslim, gave a different version of the abduction. She said Mr Sabaya, who is related to her mother, had been pressurising the couple to visit the rebels on Jolo. They finally agreed, and went by boat from Zamboanga on Sunday, she said. Unable to hold back her tears, Ms Osani said Mr Schilling had told her to return alone to Zamboanga, and she had not discovered until her arrival on Tuesday that he had been kidnapped. The Philippine government's chief negotiator, Robert Aventajado, insisted that Mr Schilling's capture had nothing to do with the payment of $6m for the release of the six prisoners this week and $5.5m for 10 others freed in July. \"It is not open season on kidnapping of tourists now,\" he said. \"From what I heard the American was seized because he made the Abu Sayyaf angry by asking too many suspicious questions.\" Rajab Azzarouq, the leading Libyan intermediary in the negotiations, denied that the money had been paid directly to Abu Sayyaf, saying: \"We gave the money to the local people for humanitarian projects, economic projects and social projects. It was not a ransom.\" He was speaking just before the six freed hostages were paraded in front of the world's media. The ceremony took place at a bombed-out barracks that was destroyed in an American raid in 1986. Among those killed in the attack was one of his adopted daughters. The French and German governments, who had nationals among those freed, have heaped praise upon Libya for its role in the crisis. Analysts say Mr Gadafy is using the crisis to alter his image as a sponsor of international terrorism. Five of the the hostages freed this week were among 21 people seized from a Malaysian diving resort on the island of Sipaden on April 23. The sixth is one of three French journalists seized on July 9 while covering the crisis. Her two colleagues are still being held.",

But if the rule of law is to prevail, there must be circumstances in which a breach of confidence is at least excusable, if not wholly justified. If a member of the secret service were instructed to commit a crime and reported it to the police and no action was taken, surely the overriding importance of the freedom of the press should prevail and the right of the public to be informed? In an address to the Dicey Conference in 1987, I referred to breach of confidence as one of the constraints on the press, but it is well established, by a number of decisions, and in particular, by the late Lord Denning, not only that exposure of \"iniquity\" justifies a breach of confidence, but that term was merely an instance of \"just cause or excuse\" for breaching confidence (Fraser v Evans 1969) \"that it would be proper to disclose a crime to the police\". That decision concerned a breach of confidence by an employee. To contend that a member of the secret service is barred from exposing a threat to murder a head of state against which we are not at war would be to put one part of the community above the law of the land. To conspire, however, to eliminate a head of state with whom our country is at war would seem not only to be excusable but justified. It is a terrible irony when, apparently, it is considered to be entirely excusable, if not justified, to bomb, kill and maim from the air innocent civilians who are not responsible for their country going to war, and yet to leave unharmed (as in the case of Milosevic and Hussein) the heads of state responsible for involving their citizens in military activity.

Chairman Peter Rigby said Informa historically had bought small companies with pre-tax profits around the \u00a31m mark but in future it would be concentrating on ones 10 times this size. It is examining the possibility of purchasing titles for the drugs sector to fill a gap in its existing portfolio. Informa is already strong in telecoms, media and shipping where it owns the daily maritime paper Lloyds List. Profits before tax and exceptional items in the first six months rose 28% to \u00a320.6m, with adjusted earnings per share up 29% and a dividend of 2.53p proposed. The shares, which have already outperformed the sector by 6% this year, rose a further 29.5p to 749.5p.",

      "body": "<p>Edith K\u00f6rner, who has died of cancer aged 79, was an influential figure in the development of the information and statistics system used by the National Health Service. Edith also played a significant role as chair of the magistrates' bench in Bristol. Edith was one of that band of remarkable people who came as refugees to this country from eastern Europe and who have contributed so much and in so many ways to its wellbeing.</p> <p>Born in Znojmo, Czechoslovakia, the daughter of a prosperous corn miller, she arrived in the United Kingdom as a schoolgirl in 1939, alone, and never again to see her parents or 40 other relatives who perished in the Nazi extermination camps. She spoke no English but was fluent in Russian, German, Italian and French. These skills, allied with her intelligence and determination, enabled her to earn a living monitoring enemy military and civilian radio traffic; at the same time she obtained, in two years, an honours degree in economics at the London School of Economics.</p> <p>During the war, she met her husband Stephan, also from Czechoslovakia, who was doing a PhD in philosophy at Cambridge University. When the war ended, she went with him to Bristol, where he had obtained a chair at the university. There, they brought up their two children and she began her involvement in public life.</p> <p>Perhaps it was natural with her background that she should first support the weakest and most vulnerable people. In the 1950s, patients with mental illness in large institutions were the often conveniently forgotten part of the NHS.

      "bodyText": "Edith K\u00f6rner, who has died of cancer aged 79, was an influential figure in the development of the information and statistics system used by the National Health Service. Edith also played a significant role as chair of the magistrates' bench in Bristol. Edith was one of that band of remarkable people who came as refugees to this country from eastern Europe and who have contributed so much and in so many ways to its wellbeing. Born in Znojmo, Czechoslovakia, the daughter of a prosperous corn miller, she arrived in the United Kingdom as a schoolgirl in 1939, alone, and never again to see her parents or 40 other relatives who perished in the Nazi extermination camps. She spoke no English but was fluent in Russian, German, Italian and French. These skills, allied with her intelligence and determination, enabled her to earn a living monitoring enemy military and civilian radio traffic; at the same time she obtained, in two years, an honours degree in economics at the London School of Economics. During the war, she met her husband Stephan, also from Czechoslovakia, who was doing a PhD in philosophy at Cambridge University. When the war ended, she went with him to Bristol, where he had obtained a chair at the university. There, they brought up their two children and she began her involvement in public life. Perhaps it was natural with her background that she should first support the weakest and most vulnerable people. In the 1950s, patients with mental illness in large institutions were the often conveniently forgotten part of the NHS. Edith realised that with modern drug treatment and support many patients could live at home or in the wider community. She exerted a crucial influence in the restructuring of this sector, showing how this might be achieved through the work she supported at the long-stay Barrow and Glenside hospitals in Bristol. This led to appointments in the regional health service - she became chair of the south western regional health authority in 1976 - where she established a national reputation for clear thinking, innovation and the ability to speak with knowledge on a range of issues. No one was surprised when she was chosen in 1980 by the then secretary of state for social services, Patrick Jenkin, to chair a full-scale review of health service information. The K\u00f6rner committee sat for four years and produced six reports, all of which were, unusually, accepted and acted upon within deadlines. It was the first major examination of the way the NHS collected and used its data and set the way forward for a comprehensive computerisation of the health system. For her work on the committee, she was awarded a CBE. Her energies, however, were not contained only in this field. In 1966, she was appointed a magistrate on the city bench in Bristol. Her proudest moment came when she was elected its first chairwoman. She was sharp with those who she felt did not appreciate the need to separate the judiciary from the executive as the lynchpin in our democratic government. She had experienced the breakdown of this in her childhood and was only too aware of the vigilance necessary to maintain it - and how easy it was to take it for granted. In support of this, she co-wrote a paper entitled Reducing Delays in Magistrates Courts: A Practical Guide. It was a sorrow to her that her suggestions were not heeded in the same way as her work for the NHS. It could have saved millions and provided for much quicker and fairer treatment of defendants. The leadership of this distinguished and highly intelligent woman reached its peak during the so-called \"poll tax\" disturbances.

As the pizza and Italian food sector as a whole has modernised, and with the advent of stylised, and affordable outlets such as Pizza Express expanding across the country, the sector appears to be attracting a new customer base. </p> <p>Asher Svirsky, a former hotel chef, and Russell Allen, ex- food and beverage manager at a Thistle hotel in London, spent the best part of a year researching the restaurant trade with the aim of setting up an eaterie in South London. It wasn't long before they had abandoned the idea and launched a pizza delivery service. Their London-based, up-market operation Basilico, which sells top-of-the-range (ie pay more for quality) takeaway and delivery pizzas, launched at the end of 1998 and its two units have an annual turnover in excess of \u00a31m.

Metaphorical references to a business smashing through the stratosphere aside, the pizza business in Britain is literally taking off. As the pizza and Italian food sector as a whole has modernised, and with the advent of stylised, and affordable outlets such as Pizza Express expanding across the country, the sector appears to be attracting a new customer base. Asher Svirsky, a former hotel chef, and Russell Allen, ex- food and beverage manager at a Thistle hotel in London, spent the best part of a year researching the restaurant trade with the aim of setting up an eaterie in South London. It wasn't long before they had abandoned the idea and launched a pizza delivery service. Their London-based, up-market operation Basilico, which sells top-of-the-range (ie pay more for quality) takeaway and delivery pizzas, launched at the end of 1998 and its two units have an annual turnover in excess of \u00a31m. The two entrepreneurs have lofty ambitions. \"We decided on pizzas because the sector is growing at a faster pace than any other,\" Svirsky says. When we first spoke to people in the sector they said there was no point because it was saturated.

      "body": "<p>So, you think that you get along well with your boss? Maybe they compliment you on a job well done, send you a birthday card or invite you to spend the weekend at their country retreat. But how much do they like you really? Think ahead, as far as 30 years. When your boss dies, will he like you enough to remember you in his will? </p> <p>It sounds highly unlikely in today's frantically insecure workplace, yet earlier this month, that is what happened to 15 long-serving employees of the late Tory MP Michael Colvin. When he and his wife died in a fire at their home, recipients of their bequests included the gardener Bernard Taylor, who received \u00a36,700, and the laundry lady, the farm manager, the butler and the butler's wife, all of whom received \u00a31,000. </p> <p>While most employers might not go quite this far, there is evidence that an increasing number of firms are keen to foster a similarly paternalistic culture of loyalty. One recent example of this came from management consultants Arthur Andersen who announced that they are to hand out \u00a310,000 \"golden hellos\" to welcome all new graduate trainees, claiming that rather than wanting to trap them into a job for life, they were doing it because they wanted to help the recruits pay off their student debts. </p> <p>Elsewhere, particularly in the City, where the dot.com brain drain is hitting staffing levels, companies are trying to hang on to people by introducing supermarket-style reward points. These are accumulated and cashed in for benefits covering everything from paid sabbaticals to in-house yoga sessions. Nowhere is this loyalty culture more evident than at the west end offices of TBWA, the advertising agency, whose clients include the Labour Party. Staff can chill out in a leisure zone equipped with two Sony Playstation pods and all the latest games, video screens and a pool table. At six o'clock every evening the reception area is transformed into a subsidised bar and twice a week there's a happy hour where all drinks are free. </p> <p>The company is one of many who now offer two \"duvet days\" a year, where workers get permission to skive off, presumably very popular on mornings after happy hour. \"People work long hours here, and we want to reward them for that,\" explains Neil Christie, chief operating officer. \"One way is by letting them have a drink at the end of the day, it's kind of like everyone meeting up in the village square. Very often staff will then go back to their desks and work several hours in the evening, so it's like a tea break with booze. We like to make our staff feel part of something, to try and give something back.\" </p> <p>Increasingly, companies are falling over themselves to remind stressed-out workers that, yes, they may be working 12-hour days, but don't think for a minute that the boss doesn't care. \"The traditional concept of the loyal, wise boss who handed down universal benefits from on high is dead,\" says Nick Page, adviser on pay and conditions for the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development. \"That all disappeared during the high white-collar unemployment of the early 1980s; employees became disillusioned and more demanding. </p> <p>\"Now bosses are having to wake up to the fact that their staff are both individuals, and customers. In practice, that means companies are having to address the diversity of lifestyles among their workforce - in a creative business with a young staff, for example, it's not appropriate only to offer childcare and pension plans. By contrast, pet insurance is very popular in those types of firms - and 3% of firms we surveyed now offer that. Another way companies are trying to create loyalty is by giving something back, especially when staff work very long hours. That's why we're seeing 'concierge' benefits - grocery shopping, laundry and even on-site evening classes - becoming very popular.\" </p> <p>In the quest to nurture stressed-out employees, firms are resorting to increasingly desperate measures. Law firm Mischon de Reya experimented with a company poet. Management consultants Ernst and Young offer a confidential counselling line for staff to sort out their personal lives. Credit Suisse First Boston now offers honeymoon leave, and elsewhere in the City, Saloman Smith Barney has taken to providing gourmet meals, fresh underwear and free toothbrushes to staff working past 7pm. </p> <p>\"If you want to keep staff then you have to look after them,\" says Hilda Barrett, group human resources manager at Microsoft. \"That's why we try and create a campus atmosphere at our office. We have top quality gourmet food always available and in the evenings we even run cookery classes. Oh yes, and you also get Waitrose Direct, a grocery shopping service. Who wants to waste their spare time pushing a supermarket trolley?\" Every morning Microsoft workers are offered free fruit with breakfast, a nice touch, but one which might feel annoyingly prescriptive. At their headquarters there is an area called \"the anarchy zone\" where stressed out workers can play pool, watch a 54-inch cable TV screen, lounge around on squashy sofas, play video games, drink top quality lattes or read all the latest magazines. Despite the fact that writer Douglas Coupland branded the firm's workers Microserfs in a recent book, the staff turnover in the UK is only 8%. \"We must be doing something right,\" says Barrett. </p> <p>It's not surprising that the most far-reaching loyalty programmes are being introduced by American firms, where staff benefits are far more sophisticated. Ford provides its assembly line workers with free home computers, while it's rumoured that New York restaurants are resorting to pension plans in a bid to recruit dish washers. Recently, Seattle software company Aventail was so desperate to hire one 19-year-old graduate that it relocated two of her friends from Ohio and found them jobs too. </p> <p>As we all spend more and more of our lives at work, many employers are attempting to redress the balance by making office life more like home, often with the boss cast as surrogate parent. Business development agency The Fourth Room, for example, has offices which are designed like a house. Each morning the kitchen table is set for breakfast and a family lunch is held twice a week. British Airways' new head office near Heathrow takes the concept a stage further, featuring a Big Brother style corporate village with its own high street and TV station BA TV. More worrying still, staff are no longer known as employees but as residents. </p> <p>\"I don't think company loyalty is dead,\" says Lin Arigho, who runs design consultancy Aricot Vert. She was voted Britain's best boss in a recent competition of worker-friendly employers. \"I give people time off to go and do things that will help them to develop. One chap went off backpacking for eight weeks, another had time off for the Chelsea Flower Show. If they phone in and say they can't come in one day, they don't have to tell me the reason. I trust them. But I get it back from them in the end, because it's a case of me saving it up for later. If I need something finishing in a hurry, I know I can turn round to a person I've been very flexible with, and say, 'Now you can do this for me.'\" </p> <p>So maybe not everything about these new forward-thinking offices is perfect. \"You've got to question some of their motives,\" says Nick Page of the CIPD. \"If they're doing your shopping and laundry and dry-cleaning, and offering free drinks in the evening, the end result of all that is that you may end up working longer and longer hours with no overtime.\" </p> <p><strong> How loyal are you?</strong></p> <p><strong>Trisha King, media researcher</strong> </p> <p>I'm only here until I can get a break in the field I want. I know that and the company knows that - it even gives me time off for interviews. It's a small firm and we all get along brilliantly; there is constant banter in the office and we have regular staff nights out. I'll miss them but not enough to stick around. </p> <p><strong> Ben Andersen, urban regenerator</strong> </p> <p>I'm new to the company so my loyalty is at its all time high. At the moment it's inconceivable to see myself being tempted away. To keep up this level of loyalty the company would have to be more diverse than it is now. I can see myself moving in a couple of years' time because I want to change the field I'm in. If the company itself took that direction I would probably stay. </p> <p><strong> Elizabeth Coates, financial journalist</strong> </p> <p>I'll be loyal to this publication as long as it continues to provide me with opportunities - I don't want to get stuck in a rut. The magazine has a really good working environment, as well as an impressive reputation. I travel abroad frequently and the money's good. I wouldn't change jobs for a pay rise alone - it would have to be something which interested me. </p> <p><strong> Catherine Conway, bartender</strong> </p> <p>I'm totally loyal to the pub I work in because I'm treated well. They pay me decent money, give me lunch when I work and days off when I want, so I work hard. I used to work in a London pub owned by a big brewery. I got \u00a32.50 an hour and was treated like dirt. I couldn't have given a monkey's about them. This is a little company - we're treated well and work hard in return.</p>",

We like to make our staff feel part of something, to try and give something back.\" Increasingly, companies are falling over themselves to remind stressed-out workers that, yes, they may be working 12-hour days, but don't think for a minute that the boss doesn't care. \"The traditional concept of the loyal, wise boss who handed down universal benefits from on high is dead,\" says Nick Page, adviser on pay and conditions for the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development. \"That all disappeared during the high white-collar unemployment of the early 1980s; employees became disillusioned and more demanding. \"Now bosses are having to wake up to the fact that their staff are both individuals, and customers. In practice, that means companies are having to address the diversity of lifestyles among their workforce - in a creative business with a young staff, for example, it's not appropriate only to offer childcare and pension plans. By contrast, pet insurance is very popular in those types of firms - and 3% of firms we surveyed now offer that. Another way companies are trying to create loyalty is by giving something back, especially when staff work very long hours. That's why we're seeing 'concierge' benefits - grocery shopping, laundry and even on-site evening classes - becoming very popular.\" In the quest to nurture stressed-out employees, firms are resorting to increasingly desperate measures. Law firm Mischon de Reya experimented with a company poet. Management consultants Ernst and Young offer a confidential counselling line for staff to sort out their personal lives. Credit Suisse First Boston now offers honeymoon leave, and elsewhere in the City, Saloman Smith Barney has taken to providing gourmet meals, fresh underwear and free toothbrushes to staff working past 7pm. \"If you want to keep staff then you have to look after them,\" says Hilda Barrett, group human resources manager at Microsoft. \"That's why we try and create a campus atmosphere at our office. We have top quality gourmet food always available and in the evenings we even run cookery classes. Oh yes, and you also get Waitrose Direct, a grocery shopping service. Who wants to waste their spare time pushing a supermarket trolley?\" Every morning Microsoft workers are offered free fruit with breakfast, a nice touch, but one which might feel annoyingly prescriptive. At their headquarters there is an area called \"the anarchy zone\" where stressed out workers can play pool, watch a 54-inch cable TV screen, lounge around on squashy sofas, play video games, drink top quality lattes or read all the latest magazines. Despite the fact that writer Douglas Coupland branded the firm's workers Microserfs in a recent book, the staff turnover in the UK is only 8%. \"We must be doing something right,\" says Barrett. It's not surprising that the most far-reaching loyalty programmes are being introduced by American firms, where staff benefits are far more sophisticated. Ford provides its assembly line workers with free home computers, while it's rumoured that New York restaurants are resorting to pension plans in a bid to recruit dish washers. Recently, Seattle software company Aventail was so desperate to hire one 19-year-old graduate that it relocated two of her friends from Ohio and found them jobs too. As we all spend more and more of our lives at work, many employers are attempting to redress the balance by making office life more like home, often with the boss cast as surrogate parent. Business development agency The Fourth Room, for example, has offices which are designed like a house. Each morning the kitchen table is set for breakfast and a family lunch is held twice a week. British Airways' new head office near Heathrow takes the concept a stage further, featuring a Big Brother style corporate village with its own high street and TV station BA TV. More worrying still, staff are no longer known as employees but as residents. \"I don't think company loyalty is dead,\" says Lin Arigho, who runs design consultancy Aricot Vert. She was voted Britain's best boss in a recent competition of worker-friendly employers. \"I give people time off to go and do things that will help them to develop. One chap went off backpacking for eight weeks, another had time off for the Chelsea Flower Show. If they phone in and say they can't come in one day, they don't have to tell me the reason. I trust them. But I get it back from them in the end, because it's a case of me saving it up for later. If I need something finishing in a hurry, I know I can turn round to a person I've been very flexible with, and say, 'Now you can do this for me.'\" So maybe not everything about these new forward-thinking offices is perfect. \"You've got to question some of their motives,\" says Nick Page of the CIPD. \"If they're doing your shopping and laundry and dry-cleaning, and offering free drinks in the evening, the end result of all that is that you may end up working longer and longer hours with no overtime.\" How loyal are you? Trisha King, media researcher I'm only here until I can get a break in the field I want. I know that and the company knows that - it even gives me time off for interviews. It's a small firm and we all get along brilliantly; there is constant banter in the office and we have regular staff nights out. I'll miss them but not enough to stick around. Ben Andersen, urban regenerator I'm new to the company so my loyalty is at its all time high. At the moment it's inconceivable to see myself being tempted away. To keep up this level of loyalty the company would have to be more diverse than it is now. I can see myself moving in a couple of years' time because I want to change the field I'm in. If the company itself took that direction I would probably stay. Elizabeth Coates, financial journalist I'll be loyal to this publication as long as it continues to provide me with opportunities - I don't want to get stuck in a rut. The magazine has a really good working environment, as well as an impressive reputation. I travel abroad frequently and the money's good. I wouldn't change jobs for a pay rise alone - it would have to be something which interested me. Catherine Conway, bartender I'm totally loyal to the pub I work in because I'm treated well. They pay me decent money, give me lunch when I work and days off when I want, so I work hard. I used to work in a London pub owned by a big brewery. I got \u00a32.50 an hour and was treated like dirt. I couldn't have given a monkey's about them. This is a little company - we're treated well and work hard in return.",

Sir Charles Mackerras and the Czech Philharmonic showcased Suk's most ambitious work, the Asrael Symphony, in the first of their Edinburgh international festival concerts, but while this may have been a festival event in name, there was nothing particularly festive about a half-full Usher Hall. Maybe it is because Edinburgh is steadily emptying itself of tourists, thanks to the unsynchronised starting times of the fringe and international festivals.

After Dvorak's death in 1904, Suk planned a five-movement symphony and completed the work's first three movements. Tragically, Otylka died just a year later, so Suk transformed his ideas for a fast-paced finale, and composed two slow, adagio movements in her memory.

The second movement is a warped recollection of happier times, a grotesquely slowed-down and fragmented folk dance. And for all the surface beauty of the orchestration of the scherzo third movement, there is a bitter, acerbic quality to Suk's melodic invention. The glorious tune in the central section of this movement is the only passage in the whole work where Suk allows himself to indulge in the tenderness of his love for Otylka.

      "body": "<p>The London Stock Exchange found itself fighting a hostile takeover bid yesterday for the first time in its 227-year history, as Sweden's OM Gruppen tabled an \u00a3808m offer with a promise to safeguard the future of \"Britain's crown jewel.\" </p> <p>OM, which operates the Stockholm stock market, said its cutting-edge technology could secure London's position as Europe's centre for share dealing. Its plans were given a qualified welcome by some of the City's leading stockbrokers. </p> <p>Don Cruickshank, chairman of the London exchange, dismissed the proposal as \"derisory\" and pledged to press on with the planned merger with the Deutsche B\u00f6rse in Frankfurt, to create the iX exchange. </p> <p>Mr Cruickshank said: \"Their offer does little to advance our strategic goals in Europe. Our customers want European consolidation.\" </p> <p>After an hour-long meeting of its 13-strong board, the London exchange agreed to postpone a vote on the iX deal, which was scheduled for September 14. </p> <p>There was intense speculation that the Deutsche B\u00f6rse would make a \"white knight\" offer to be considered alongside the Swedish proposal. OM offered 700p in cash and 0.65 of its shares for each London Stock Exchange share. </p> <p>The Swedish group specialises in selling systems to exchanges around the world. Per Larsson, president of OM, said: \"We believe it's a perfect marriage. OM Gruppen is a leading technology company. Technology is the prime driver behind the reshaping in equity markets.\" </p> <p>OM's vice-president, Magnus Karlsson B\u00f6cker, admitted that a takeover of the stock exchange would stun traditionalists. But he said: \"We're trying to save the crown jewels - we're trying to create something. What's proposed at the moment is to give away the future Microsoft of the UK to the Germans.\" </p> <p>As share dealing becomes more international, the Swedish group believes that the exchange with the best technology will end up on top. The management of the London Stock Exchange disagrees - a senior source remarked yesterday that technology required to operate an exchange was \"not state of the art, not difficult stuff\". </p> <p>The source said the crucial factor was offering the lowest transaction costs, which would enable the exchange to attract more customers and provide the most price liquidity. </p> <p>There was a mixed response from the exchange's shareholders. Guinness Peat, the active investment group which has a 1% stake, said OM's offer had \"negligible financial appeal\", claiming that the shares were worth more than \u00a330 if the London exchange was valued at the same rate as the Australian and Hong Kong exchanges. </p> <p>Edmond Warner, chief executive of Old Mutual Securities, one of the exchange's largest shareholders, was more positive. Mr Warner, who is also a Guardian columnist, said: \"I think it's extremely helpful that the situation has developed into a competitive one. If I was Don Cruickshank, I would consider my response to this very carefully and I would not dismiss this offer out of hand.\" </p> <p>Some stockbrokers said the prospect of taking OM's shares was unattractive, as they were valued on a sky-high technology rating and were due for a fall. Brian Winterflood, the widely respected boss of Winterflood Securities, said: \"This price is just OM's opening shot. At least it gives us breathing space with the Deutsche B\u00f6rse deal.\" </p> <p>He said it would be \"upsetting\" for many in the City if the stock exchange was taken over.

      "bodyText": "The London Stock Exchange found itself fighting a hostile takeover bid yesterday for the first time in its 227-year history, as Sweden's OM Gruppen tabled an \u00a3808m offer with a promise to safeguard the future of \"Britain's crown jewel.\" OM, which operates the Stockholm stock market, said its cutting-edge technology could secure London's position as Europe's centre for share dealing. Its plans were given a qualified welcome by some of the City's leading stockbrokers. Don Cruickshank, chairman of the London exchange, dismissed the proposal as \"derisory\" and pledged to press on with the planned merger with the Deutsche B\u00f6rse in Frankfurt, to create the iX exchange. Mr Cruickshank said: \"Their offer does little to advance our strategic goals in Europe. Our customers want European consolidation.\" After an hour-long meeting of its 13-strong board, the London exchange agreed to postpone a vote on the iX deal, which was scheduled for September 14. There was intense speculation that the Deutsche B\u00f6rse would make a \"white knight\" offer to be considered alongside the Swedish proposal. OM offered 700p in cash and 0.65 of its shares for each London Stock Exchange share. The Swedish group specialises in selling systems to exchanges around the world. Per Larsson, president of OM, said: \"We believe it's a perfect marriage. OM Gruppen is a leading technology company. Technology is the prime driver behind the reshaping in equity markets.\" OM's vice-president, Magnus Karlsson B\u00f6cker, admitted that a takeover of the stock exchange would stun traditionalists. But he said: \"We're trying to save the crown jewels - we're trying to create something. What's proposed at the moment is to give away the future Microsoft of the UK to the Germans.\" As share dealing becomes more international, the Swedish group believes that the exchange with the best technology will end up on top. The management of the London Stock Exchange disagrees - a senior source remarked yesterday that technology required to operate an exchange was \"not state of the art, not difficult stuff\". The source said the crucial factor was offering the lowest transaction costs, which would enable the exchange to attract more customers and provide the most price liquidity. There was a mixed response from the exchange's shareholders. Guinness Peat, the active investment group which has a 1% stake, said OM's offer had \"negligible financial appeal\", claiming that the shares were worth more than \u00a330 if the London exchange was valued at the same rate as the Australian and Hong Kong exchanges. Edmond Warner, chief executive of Old Mutual Securities, one of the exchange's largest shareholders, was more positive. Mr Warner, who is also a Guardian columnist, said: \"I think it's extremely helpful that the situation has developed into a competitive one. If I was Don Cruickshank, I would consider my response to this very carefully and I would not dismiss this offer out of hand.\" Some stockbrokers said the prospect of taking OM's shares was unattractive, as they were valued on a sky-high technology rating and were due for a fall. Brian Winterflood, the widely respected boss of Winterflood Securities, said: \"This price is just OM's opening shot. At least it gives us breathing space with the Deutsche B\u00f6rse deal.\" He said it would be \"upsetting\" for many in the City if the stock exchange was taken over. But he added: \"It's not like taking over the British Museum. This is a commercial business.\" Bid Points Founded in 1985, OM Gruppen owns the Stockholm stock exchange and provides transaction technology to banks, brokers and stockmarkets in more than 20 countries. The company has a market capitalisation of \u00a32.6bn. Its main proposals, outlined in briefings held yesterday in the City of London, are: \u0095Introduce its own Unix-based trading system in place of the London Stock Exchange's existing technology. OM's systems can handle 5,000 transactions and 20,000 price changes per second . \u0095Offer shares and derivatives on a single trading platform, by exploring opportunities to collaborate with Liffe , the futures and options exchange. \u0095Make annual cost savings of more than \u00a330m within four years, largely from improved computer systems. \u0095Establish low-cost technical access points, or \"hubs\", in leading cities throughout Europe. \u0095Distribute prices, reference materials and clearing reports by making use of the internet . \u0095Appoint non-executive directors to represent the interests of the London exchange's participants. \u0095Allow the London exchange to remain as a stand-alone operation , regulated by the financial services authority.",

Yes, there would be some impact on business - although not a large financial one, as I suggest the paternity leave payments be reclaimed from the exchequer, as maternity payments are. The truth is that the shortest-sighted and loudest end of the business lobby have opposed every move to increase time off for workers on the grounds that it would destroy businesses. They are always wrong.

The idea that men just aren't built to care for children belongs in the dustbin of history. </p> <p>The attacks from the left are trickier. Nobody in government, or the trade unions is prepared to say publicly that so long as women take more time off than men, employers have rational grounds for discrimination. Plenty of them agree in private, needless to say, but think admitting it openly would encourage employers in this behaviour. \"I agree with you,\" said one trade union official. \"But you can't say it - it plays into the hands of the right.\" This is an absurd situation. Everyone knows it is happening, but progressives close their eyes to it. </p> <p>The Cabinet Office said it was nonsense to suggest that employers discriminate against women because of their role as mothers. What employers are the Cabinet Office talking to? Has anybody put a lie detector on them?

The bias against women won't just go away, no matter how hard we huff and puff. </p> <p>The TUC description of my ideas as an attack on a better deal for working mothers was odd to say the least, especially from John Monks, an intelligent, forward-looking man. How does this square with my proposal for a doubling in the amount of time off available to parents, at a cost of around \u00a31bn a year? Helping working fathers is the best way to help working mothers - by reducing their share of the domestic workload.

I simply want fathers who are not fortunate enough to be TUC employees to enjoy the same (or greater) rights. </p> <p>The best argument against my scheme is that men will not take up the offered leave, and that legislative and political energy should therefore go towards giving mothers more time off; because they'll actually use it for childcare rather than golf. The problem is that every time maternity leave is increased and time off for fathers stands still, the gap between mothers and fathers yawns even more widely.

Only Michael Owen of the original strikers is fully fit but Smith will come seriously into consideration for selection only if Cole and Phillips drop out. </p> <p>His presence in the squad is a further sign of a new generation of players making a case for forming part of England's plans for the next World Cup. Yesterday the Leeds manager David O'Leary admitted that last season the youngster's natural aggression had started to get the better of him. Worried that Smith was becoming \"a bit of a thug\" on the field, O'Leary made a special effort to sort the striker out and on the evidence so far he has been successful. </p> <p>Certainly Keegan has been impressed. \"He's very exciting but in a different way to Michael Owen,\" the England coach said yesterday. \"I think that, like Owen, he's found scoring not too difficult at the start of the season, which is always great for strikers because they need goals. That's what they live off.\" </p> <p>The likelihood is that Keegan will pair Owen and Cole up front in the Stade de France on Saturday night as he seeks a new scoring combination after Alan Shearer's retirement from international football. This is the only match the England coach will have in which to assess his side between the premature exit from Euro 2000 and the World Cup qualifiers against Germany and Finland on October 7 and 11. </p> <p>In terms of team development the biggest disappointment for Keegan yesterday was the recurring groin problem that has forced Gerrard out of the France game and probably the first two World Cup games. The 20-year-old Liverpool player's performance as a substitute against Germany in Charleroi promised to solve England's inability to combine power with imagination in midfield, but the injury that sidelined him against Romania now threatens to leave his international career on hold. </p> <p>\"There is a problem that Liverpool are well aware of,\" Keegan explained, \"and I just hope they sort it out for the lad. He's a tremendous talent. Sometimes the injury will be his groin, sometimes a hamstring, which suggests that the real trouble is in his back.\" The feeling in Liverpool is that the problem is with the groin, and the likelihood is that he will undergo an operation in the next couple of weeks. </p> <p>Keegan wanted Gerrard to play for a full 90 minutes against France, when a good performance would have eased some of England's anxieties for the games against the Germans and the Finns. Now the best the England coach can hope for is that his midfield can keep the ball long enough to tell him something about the international form of, say, Darren Anderton or Nick Barmby, which will in turn give the strikers a better opportunity to shine. </p> <p>Keegan is thinking of using Anderton wide on the right and moving David Beckham inside, where he would have a better chance of exploiting Owen's speed with accurate passes. \"The thing you need with David Beckham, certainly if he plays central, is an option to find people with the sort of ball he gave Ryan Giggs at West Ham on Saturday when Andy Cole scored Manchester United's second goal,\" he said. </p> <p>England's early progress towards the 2002 World Cup will depend on Beckham and Paul Scholes staying fit and in form along with the new captain Tony Adams, Sol Campbell rediscovering the international qualities he developed under Glenn Hoddle, and the 36-year-old David Seaman quelling growing doubts about his goalkeeping. </p> <p>As for Keegan, well Johnny Giles, the former Manchester United, Leeds and Republic of Ireland player, has rightly pointed out in his newspaper column that the cheerleading that preceded Euro 2000 can hardly be recycled. Giles thinks the England coach should have resigned by now but yesterday, although Keegan gave his press conference in a hotel in the Chiltern Hundreds, he was clearly not thinking of applying for them. </p> <p>\"The opinions of ex-players and people who've played and managed at the highest level, if it is damning, hurts more than criticism from people who are outsiders looking in,\" Keegan conceded. \"For me success is winning something. It always has been. \"I don't necessarily want to be a hero but I don't want to be - what was the word somebody used? - a suspect. I don't think players are suspects. Only criminals are suspects.\" </p> <p>A bad performance against France, however, and the media will put out an APB on Keegan, be sure of that.</p>",

His presence in the squad is a further sign of a new generation of players making a case for forming part of England's plans for the next World Cup. Yesterday the Leeds manager David O'Leary admitted that last season the youngster's natural aggression had started to get the better of him. Worried that Smith was becoming \"a bit of a thug\" on the field, O'Leary made a special effort to sort the striker out and on the evidence so far he has been successful. Certainly Keegan has been impressed. \"He's very exciting but in a different way to Michael Owen,\" the England coach said yesterday. \"I think that, like Owen, he's found scoring not too difficult at the start of the season, which is always great for strikers because they need goals. That's what they live off.\" The likelihood is that Keegan will pair Owen and Cole up front in the Stade de France on Saturday night as he seeks a new scoring combination after Alan Shearer's retirement from international football. This is the only match the England coach will have in which to assess his side between the premature exit from Euro 2000 and the World Cup qualifiers against Germany and Finland on October 7 and 11. In terms of team development the biggest disappointment for Keegan yesterday was the recurring groin problem that has forced Gerrard out of the France game and probably the first two World Cup games. The 20-year-old Liverpool player's performance as a substitute against Germany in Charleroi promised to solve England's inability to combine power with imagination in midfield, but the injury that sidelined him against Romania now threatens to leave his international career on hold. \"There is a problem that Liverpool are well aware of,\" Keegan explained, \"and I just hope they sort it out for the lad. He's a tremendous talent. Sometimes the injury will be his groin, sometimes a hamstring, which suggests that the real trouble is in his back.\" The feeling in Liverpool is that the problem is with the groin, and the likelihood is that he will undergo an operation in the next couple of weeks. Keegan wanted Gerrard to play for a full 90 minutes against France, when a good performance would have eased some of England's anxieties for the games against the Germans and the Finns. Now the best the England coach can hope for is that his midfield can keep the ball long enough to tell him something about the international form of, say, Darren Anderton or Nick Barmby, which will in turn give the strikers a better opportunity to shine. Keegan is thinking of using Anderton wide on the right and moving David Beckham inside, where he would have a better chance of exploiting Owen's speed with accurate passes. \"The thing you need with David Beckham, certainly if he plays central, is an option to find people with the sort of ball he gave Ryan Giggs at West Ham on Saturday when Andy Cole scored Manchester United's second goal,\" he said. England's early progress towards the 2002 World Cup will depend on Beckham and Paul Scholes staying fit and in form along with the new captain Tony Adams, Sol Campbell rediscovering the international qualities he developed under Glenn Hoddle, and the 36-year-old David Seaman quelling growing doubts about his goalkeeping. As for Keegan, well Johnny Giles, the former Manchester United, Leeds and Republic of Ireland player, has rightly pointed out in his newspaper column that the cheerleading that preceded Euro 2000 can hardly be recycled. Giles thinks the England coach should have resigned by now but yesterday, although Keegan gave his press conference in a hotel in the Chiltern Hundreds, he was clearly not thinking of applying for them. \"The opinions of ex-players and people who've played and managed at the highest level, if it is damning, hurts more than criticism from people who are outsiders looking in,\" Keegan conceded. \"For me success is winning something. It always has been. \"I don't necessarily want to be a hero but I don't want to be - what was the word somebody used? - a suspect. I don't think players are suspects. Only criminals are suspects.\" A bad performance against France, however, and the media will put out an APB on Keegan, be sure of that.",

Clearly he had not forgotten. </p> <p>He tore into Wolves with venom, securing Portsmouth their first league victory of the season, and might easily have scored more against a hesitant defence in which Manuel Thetis, on loan from Ipswich, was making his debut. </p> <p>Afterwards Claridge admitted: \"My time at Wolves was not the best. I was disappointed I didn't have the opportunity to show them what I could do. Sometimes I do feel I have a point to prove and maybe now they realise I could have done a job for them. Perhaps it was a case of being the wrong man at the wrong time.\" </p> <p>He opened his account in 90 seconds as he capitalised on slipshod Wolves defending.

      "bodyText": "Steve Claridge took revenge on the club that discarded him after five months when he scored a hat-trick in little more than half an hour yesterday. The striker, now 34, spent an unhappy spell at Molineux two years ago in which he failed to score and was pilloried by the fans. Clearly he had not forgotten. He tore into Wolves with venom, securing Portsmouth their first league victory of the season, and might easily have scored more against a hesitant defence in which Manuel Thetis, on loan from Ipswich, was making his debut. Afterwards Claridge admitted: \"My time at Wolves was not the best. I was disappointed I didn't have the opportunity to show them what I could do. Sometimes I do feel I have a point to prove and maybe now they realise I could have done a job for them. Perhaps it was a case of being the wrong man at the wrong time.\" He opened his account in 90 seconds as he capitalised on slipshod Wolves defending. Kevin Harper played a short corner to Nigel Quashie, who produced a curling cross which allowed Claridge a free header which he dispatched from 10 yards. Michael Oakes, Wolves' goalkeeper, denied Claridge a second a couple of minutes later with his legs but before the half-hour, from Quashie's corner, Oakes found himself tangled among his own defenders and Claridge tapped in from inside the six-yard area. His hat-trick was only two minutes away. When Lee Naylor pushed Gary O'Neil there was only one player who was going to take the spot-kick. Wolves, unbeaten in their opening three games, looked out of sorts but pulled a goal back on the stroke of half-time. Darren Bazeley helped on a clearance from Oakes and Temuri Ketsbaia, a \u00a3900,000 signing from Newcastle, unleashed a low shot from the edge of the penalty area which gave Russell Hoult no chance. Claridge continued to torment the defence and nearly added a fourth when, with the outside of his foot, he swerved the ball in from a tight angle only to see it bounce back off the bar with Oakes helpless.",

And BSkyB is expected to shortly reveal a sponsorship deal with a Sky One comedy show. </p> <p>Guy Hornsby, chief executive of Comedyred.com and former ceo of commercial radio group Faze FM, which operates Kiss 102 and Kiss 105, declined to confirm whether a sponsorship deal with a show is on the cards. However, he confirmed that a number of marketing and sponsorship deals are being discussed. </p> <p>Sky One's autumn schedule includes two new flagship comedy shows: Harry Enfield's Brand Spanking New Show and Al Murray's Time Gentlemen Please. Excite has already signed a \u00a3300,000 sponsorship deal with the latter, and Letsbuyit.com is to sponsor the Harry Enfield show.</p> <p>It is thought that an enhanced TV version of the site will eventually be built into the broadcast stream behind Sky One programming. This will allow viewers to email each other or buy merchandise while watching the programmes.</p> <p>BSkyB recently increased its shareholding in Sky Digital interactive TV service Open from 32.5% to 80.1% to enable it to boost its interactive and enhanced TV output.</p> <p>ComedyRed, which offers animated games, listings, news, reviews, a searchable jokes archive, chat events and special webcasts, is backed by restaurateur-turned-start-up incubator Luke Johnson, PR guru-turned-internet entrepreneur Matthew Freud and William Burdett-Coutts, former director of Edinburgh's Assembly Rooms. They clubbed together to provide seed funding for <a href=\"http://www.comedyred.com\">Comedyred.com</a>, which is talking to venture capitalists about first-round funding. </p> <p>BSkyB's stake in ComedyRed is the seventh it has taken in a dot.com since kicking off its investment strategy in November last year with a 5% stake in Toyzone.co.uk. Other investments include a \u00a310m stake in LetsBuyIt.com, 14% of Streets Online, 5.4% of Sportal and 10% of Gameplay.</p>",

      "bodyText": "BSkyB has resumed its dot.com stake strategy by acquiring 8% of the comedy portal Comedyred.com which is backed by a collection of high-profile entrepreneurs including PR man, Matthew Freud. The deal, which is tied to the development of the Sky One website (www.Sky.com/one) into a strong entertainment site, represents the first dot.com stake BSkyB has acquired since purchasing an 18% share in teen portal Mykindaplace.com earlier this year. As part of the non-cash deal, Comedyred.com has been given prominent links from both Sky.com and Sky.com/one. And BSkyB is expected to shortly reveal a sponsorship deal with a Sky One comedy show. Guy Hornsby, chief executive of Comedyred.com and former ceo of commercial radio group Faze FM, which operates Kiss 102 and Kiss 105, declined to confirm whether a sponsorship deal with a show is on the cards. However, he confirmed that a number of marketing and sponsorship deals are being discussed. Sky One's autumn schedule includes two new flagship comedy shows: Harry Enfield's Brand Spanking New Show and Al Murray's Time Gentlemen Please. Excite has already signed a \u00a3300,000 sponsorship deal with the latter, and Letsbuyit.com is to sponsor the Harry Enfield show. It is thought that an enhanced TV version of the site will eventually be built into the broadcast stream behind Sky One programming. This will allow viewers to email each other or buy merchandise while watching the programmes. BSkyB recently increased its shareholding in Sky Digital interactive TV service Open from 32.5% to 80.1% to enable it to boost its interactive and enhanced TV output. ComedyRed, which offers animated games, listings, news, reviews, a searchable jokes archive, chat events and special webcasts, is backed by restaurateur-turned-start-up incubator Luke Johnson, PR guru-turned-internet entrepreneur Matthew Freud and William Burdett-Coutts, former director of Edinburgh's Assembly Rooms. They clubbed together to provide seed funding for Comedyred.com, which is talking to venture capitalists about first-round funding. BSkyB's stake in ComedyRed is the seventh it has taken in a dot.com since kicking off its investment strategy in November last year with a 5% stake in Toyzone.co.uk. Other investments include a \u00a310m stake in LetsBuyIt.com, 14% of Streets Online, 5.4% of Sportal and 10% of Gameplay.",

Having unsuccessfully tried moving people to where the jobs are, Labour should try moving the jobs where the people are.</p> <p>Next, Labour should turn the debate about public spending on its head, putting the emphasis on what is needed rather than what can be afforded.

      "body": "<p>The campaign against grammar schools is to be relaunched this week, after the government bowed to presure to make it easier for parents to abolish the surviving 165 selective schools.</p> <p>Campaigners in Kent, which has the largest number of grammar schools, 33, will on Friday reactivate the petitioning process they were forced to abandon this year. The government is to relax some of the technical regulations to make it easier for campaigners to collect the signatures they need to force a vote among parents.</p> <p>But the education secretary, David Blunkett, is expected to face fierce criticism of Labour's policy on grammar schools at a fringe meeting at the party conference at the end of next month. It has been accused of \"sitting on the fence\" by letting parents decide the schools' fate.</p> <p>Speakers on the highly sensitive issue will include Lord Hattersley, a former Labour deputy leader, who is still outraged over Mr Blunkett's claim this year that his \"read my lips\" comment about being opposed to selection was a joke.</p> <p>The campaign in Kent was suspended at the end of March because of \"political confusion\" over the issue, the complexity of the rules governing petitions and ballots, and a tight deadline. Campaigners needed to get 46,000 signatures of eligible parents for a vote to take place but are understood to have secured fewer than 7,000.</p> <p>Their decision came hard on the heels of a vote in Ripon, North Yorkshire, where a two-thirds majority voted to retain their grammar school - the oldest in England - in the first ballot under legislation introduced by Labour.</p> <p>Ballots are triggered by support from 20% of eligible parents. In Ripon it took campaigners six months to obtain the 1,800 signatures needed.</p> <p>In Kent the parents of all children at the 600 primary schools are eligible to vote. The Stop the 11-plus (Step) campaign will on Friday ask the Electoral Reform Society for a threshold figure for the number of signatures they need in 2000/2001.</p> <p>A Step spokesman, Martin Frey, said it had been told not to reprint the old petition forms, suggesting that changes were likely.

      "bodyText": "The campaign against grammar schools is to be relaunched this week, after the government bowed to presure to make it easier for parents to abolish the surviving 165 selective schools. Campaigners in Kent, which has the largest number of grammar schools, 33, will on Friday reactivate the petitioning process they were forced to abandon this year. The government is to relax some of the technical regulations to make it easier for campaigners to collect the signatures they need to force a vote among parents. But the education secretary, David Blunkett, is expected to face fierce criticism of Labour's policy on grammar schools at a fringe meeting at the party conference at the end of next month. It has been accused of \"sitting on the fence\" by letting parents decide the schools' fate. Speakers on the highly sensitive issue will include Lord Hattersley, a former Labour deputy leader, who is still outraged over Mr Blunkett's claim this year that his \"read my lips\" comment about being opposed to selection was a joke. The campaign in Kent was suspended at the end of March because of \"political confusion\" over the issue, the complexity of the rules governing petitions and ballots, and a tight deadline. Campaigners needed to get 46,000 signatures of eligible parents for a vote to take place but are understood to have secured fewer than 7,000. Their decision came hard on the heels of a vote in Ripon, North Yorkshire, where a two-thirds majority voted to retain their grammar school - the oldest in England - in the first ballot under legislation introduced by Labour. Ballots are triggered by support from 20% of eligible parents. In Ripon it took campaigners six months to obtain the 1,800 signatures needed. In Kent the parents of all children at the 600 primary schools are eligible to vote. The Stop the 11-plus (Step) campaign will on Friday ask the Electoral Reform Society for a threshold figure for the number of signatures they need in 2000/2001. A Step spokesman, Martin Frey, said it had been told not to reprint the old petition forms, suggesting that changes were likely. A spokesman for the Department for Education and Employment confirmed technical changes such as allowing space to include up to 10 names on a petition form, rather than only three. He said Mr Blunkett, in a Commons debate in June, had recognised the need for some practical changes, but there would be no amendments to the ballot system as enshrined in primary legislation. Mr Frey said: \"We are hoping for some meaningful changes that will make our Herculean task a little easier. Anything less than this and there will be hell for Mr Blunkett at the party conference.\" The selective structure in Kent was damaging standards, not raising them, he added. \"As the GCSE results showed last week, there are some comprehensives that are doing magnificently well, despite having some of the best pupils creamed off to the grammars.\" He pointed to little-known changes that meant the \"loss\" of around 500 places from Kent grammar schools next year. In addition, the 11-plus test is being changed, with a pass/fail-on-the-day format being introduced and consultation due to take place to bring it forward from January to September, when nearly all children would be only 10.",

The Belarus international was due to have a two week trial with the Magpies but manager Bobby Robson said: \"Roma wanted guarantees about the fee and we were not prepared to give them any.\" Fiorentina have agreed a fee with Barcelona for Boudewijn Zenden - but the Dutch winger is yet to be convinced of a move to Florence, reports onefootball. \"The agreement with Barcelona is already there,\" Fiorentina coach Fatih Terim has admitted. \"Now it's just a case of convincing Zenden to come to Florence. For that reason, I'll give him a call in the next few hours. For me he's the ideal player to strengthen this squad.\" Steve McManaman has turned down a move to Middlesbrough and could be off to Italy. According to the Express, Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti has confirmed he has made an \u00a38m bid for the player.",

(\u00a36)</p> <p>One swallow does not make a summer as I believe the proverb goes and Mr MacInnes would do well to remember this as last week's success seems to have gone to his head. </p> <p>As I will never tire of saying, it is a marathon not a sprint. Mr MacInnes decried his healthy \u00a311.12 profit last week as 'very little' but in the long run it is the slow accumulation of money rather than the one-off big wins that keep the bankroll going. </p> <p>This week, in search of the big hit, he went for a treble, a mistake in itself (although in this case, because one leg was a Nationwide league match, he was forced to do so by the no singles rule), but more so when you consider its component parts. </p> <p>Backing any team at 2/7 seems a doubtful course of action on the whole - if you have the 7 why do you need the 2 - but at this stage of the season, while players are still getting used to each other and the relative strengths of the opposing sides is still comparatively uncertain, it seems even more unwise. By backing a team at 2/7 you are effectively saying that if the game was played 9 times your team would win at least 7 of them (8 to for you to make a profit). Okay, so Arsenal won this time but would they win 7 times out of 9? This looks like the classic case of putting in the cert to make up the third leg of a treble, a practice that has a long and noble history of going horribly wrong.</p> <p>The second leg of the treble, Newcastle and Spurs to draw, isn't my idea of a bet, particularly given Mr MacInnes's self-justification. I'm not a big fan of backing draws generally but in matches where I expect goals this counts double; the more goals are scored in a game the less likely it is to end in a draw. If goals are expected, a better bet might be 4 or more goals (also 9/4), all you are giving up is 0-0 (an unlikely score given your reading of the game) and 1-1 and yet you get 3-1, 1-3, 2-3, 3-2 and any number of other high scores in return. The only time a draw can be value, to my mind, is in a match neither team can afford to lose (European, International or Cup matches typically) or a match between two teams that look unlikely to score against each other, and in both these cases it is almost certainly better value to back 0-0 (or rather no goalscorer so we have own goals for free) than it is the draw. </p> <p>Thus the third leg of Paul's treble, Wimbledon and Watford to draw, is another bet I would have avoided (though in this case it came up). With two winners and one loser, the trouble with trebles once again becomes clear. What could have been a good weekend turned into a losing one through pure naked greed. Patience is the key. </p> <p> <strong>Andy Knott</strong> </p> <p>Manchester City v Coventry: Goals scored 4 or more 2/1 (\u00a310) </p> <p>I don't totally disagree with this bet - at least by doing a single Mr Knott gave himself a decent chance - but I'm not convinced it was value with both defences likely to be improving match by match as they get to know their teammates and neither attack as potent as might appear from the midweek results.</p> <p>It is actually surprising how few Premiership games involve four or more goals (though 4 out of 10 games did at the weekend) - assuming an average game, the true price would be much nearer 3/1 than 2/1 - so to have a bet at 2/1 an exceptional match must be anticipated. It's not a bet I would have made but with three goals scored it was a close thing.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray</strong> </p> <p>Arsenal v Charlton: Half time - Full time Arsenal - Arsenal 4/7 (\u00a310) </p> <p>Early in the season I'd much rather be taking long odds on there being a surprise than taking short odds that the established order is confirmed. This looks like one of those bets where Mr Murray just thought 'this is going to happen' rather than really asking himself if it represented value. </p> <p>If the game was played 11 times would Arsenal be leading at half time and fulltime in at least 7 of them? If they would, then Mr Murray was just plain unlucky but I don't think so. For a start, Charlton's loss to Everton hinged on the sending-off of Carl Tiler in the first half and even after that Charlton played some good football. For a second, if Arsenal have been profligate thus far the likelihood is they will stay profligate, its no good just saying it 'can't continue'. But most importantly Mr Murray's bet is unlikely to be value because the bookies have him sussed.</p> <p>Generally speaking in a game where there is a short priced favourite the value in half-time/full-time betting is far more likely to be found in backing draw/favourite than in backing favourite/favourite, because the cunning bookmakers, knowing which outcome is always backed, artificially shorten favourite/favourite.</p> <p>In this case the odds on draw/Arsenal were 4/1, surely better value than the 4/7 on Arsenal/Arsenal, though obviously less likely to come in. The actual result, Charlton/Arsenal, was 28/1, but you would have had to be a clairvoyant to pick that one out.</p> <p><strong>Sean Ingle</strong> </p> <p>Newcastle v Spurs (Asian handicap bet) Spurs + \u00bd a goal at 8/11, Manchester City to beat Coventry (11/10), East Fife to beat Montrose (4/6), and Birmingham to beat Nottingham Forest (7/4). Four trebles at \u00a31, one accumulator at \u00a31. </p> <p>Mr Ingle, I see, has stuck doggedly to the tried and tested formula that proved so unsuccessful last week, namely picking four selections and combining them in multiples. And again, as last week, it has cost him money. His two winners, mind you, were from the English first division and the Scottish third division and as such could not be placed as singles anyway, so he has an excuse. </p> <p>His first selection, Spurs (+\u00bd) on the Asian handicap, is interesting. This is definitely a market I will be looking at closely this year as it can give you a opportunity to back against teams you don't fancy without having to worry about the dreaded draw coming along to spoil the party, as so often seems to happen. In this case I'm not so convinced that Mr Ingle was getting value, effectively through his bet he is laying Newcastle at 11/8 to win at home. And though undoubtedly Newcastle had injury worries it is important to remember that the bigger the club the less effect injuries will have on performance. For, Man Utd, for example, only the really key players such as Keane and Beckham would be a major loss because their squad is such that there is always a good player waiting to slot into the vacant position. For Newcastle, though to a lesser extent, the same thing applies. </p> <p>The other three selections also all seem fair enough though none stand out as 'must bets', which strictly speaking should be our criteria before we place a wager (though how dull life would be if we stuck to this). 11/10 about Manchester City beating Coventry seemed about right to me and in retrospect it certainly looks as though it was the Charlton result rather than the Sunderland result that will prove the truer reflection of City's form this season. </p> <p>The 4/6 about East Fife at Montrose - and I do think there is value to be had by THOROUGH research into Scottish lower division football - may prove to have been a shade of value though it's a bit early in the season to be forming judgements about the relative strengths of such unknown quantities. I don't generally approve of backing teams at odds on away from home but it must be said that in the lower Scottish divisions home advantage does not seem to count for much. Finally, Birmingham at Forest is a game I probably would have steered clear of. I have little respect for David Platt or Trevor Francis, it was just a case of which manager could waste the talent at his disposal most effectively.</p> <p>So a pretty poor week all round for our punters, but its still only August they have plenty of time to learn from their mistakes, as do we all dear punters, as do we all.</p>",

It is actually surprising how few Premiership games involve four or more goals (though 4 out of 10 games did at the weekend) - assuming an average game, the true price would be much nearer 3/1 than 2/1 - so to have a bet at 2/1 an exceptional match must be anticipated.

West Indies regained it at Lord's on August 27, 1973. This began a sequence of 13 consecutive series with West Indies winning the Trophy (they won ten of the series and three were drawn).</p> <p>This now matches American golfing dominance in the Ryder Cup. Great Britain beat the US in 1957 and the Americans were then unbeaten in 13 contests (12 wins and a tie) before losing in 1985, by which time the whole of Europe had been brought in to help out.</p> <p>The best sequence between any two nations in cricket was held by England.

      "bodyText": "If England wrap up the Test series against West Indies this week and regain the Wisden Trophy, they will avoid what is thought to be an unenviable new record: the longest run of failure for a prize between two international teams - in any sport. England have not won the Trophy since July 1, 1969. West Indies regained it at Lord's on August 27, 1973. This began a sequence of 13 consecutive series with West Indies winning the Trophy (they won ten of the series and three were drawn). This now matches American golfing dominance in the Ryder Cup. Great Britain beat the US in 1957 and the Americans were then unbeaten in 13 contests (12 wins and a tie) before losing in 1985, by which time the whole of Europe had been brought in to help out. The best sequence between any two nations in cricket was held by England. New Zealand played 20 Test series against England from 1929-30, until they won one in 1983-84. However, there was no trophy involved. The Wisden Trophy has fulfilled the role of the Ashes in Tests between England and West Indies since 1963.

The verdict on Alice Kitchen's death was delivered by the South Manchester coroner, John Pollard, after hearing a day's evidence at Tameside magistrates court. Mr Pollard recorded the same verdict earlier this month after a similar inquest into the death of Sarah Ashworth, 74. The inquest heard how former doctor Shipman, 54, left a note on the mantelpiece at 70-year-old Mrs Kitchen's home in Kirkstone Road, Hyde, Greater Manchester. It told her family that she had suffered a stroke. Later Shipman described her death as being \"a blessing\". Mr Pollard said that he had found 15 similar points between Mrs Kitchen's death and the death which formed the prosecution's case at Preston crown court, where Shipman was convicted of murdering 15 women patients. To disregard these similar facts would be \"an affront to common sense\", he said. \"Beyond any reasonable doubt, Alice Kitchen was unlawfully killed.\" He said that the pathologist and Dr Alan Banks, of West Pennine Health Authority, found no evidence to support the cause of death recorded by Shipman. Mr Pollard said that he had then looked at Mrs Kitchen's previous health and said that as she had had major surgery several weeks before her death, the surgeon and the anaesthetist would have also investigated her state of health and would not have operated if she had any obvious signs of heart trouble. Mrs Kitchen had made no complaints about her health to her family other than that she was suffering from a bit of a cold. \"The doctor apparently leaves a note on the mantelpiece indicating the patient had suffered from a stroke and telling the relatives to take her to hospital. \"That I find incredible, and I use the word accurately: I find it unbelievable that a doctor who finds a patient has had a stroke would not summon an ambulance to take her to hospital.\" The Kitchen family, who were visibly upset when they left the courtroom, declined to comment.

      "body": "<p>It has disappeared from the international headlines. Even in Germany, it has been eclipsed this summer by a running controversy over what to do with the far right.</p> <p>But, as events this week have made clear, the \"Kohl affair\" remains central to German politics. More than nine months after it erupted, it still has the ability to cause immense embarrassment to the country's main opposition party, the Christian Democrat Union (CDU), which Helmut Kohl led for 25 years.</p> <p>Yesterday, Germans were riveted by the sight of two of the party's leading figures, Mr Kohl's successor as leader, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, and the party's former treasurer, Brigitte Baumeister, giving utterly contradictory accounts of a key episode to a parliamentary inquiry.</p> <p>Their appearance before the panel arose from a DM100,000 (\u00a335,000) donation to the party's funds by Karlheinz Schreiber, the millionaire businessman whose allegations about other contributions sparked off the whole affair.</p> <p>Mr Sch\u00e4uble, who lost the party leadership as a result of the scandal, and Ms Baumeister both claimed they personally received the money. Mr Sch\u00e4uble said he had then passed it on to Ms Baumeister so that she could enter it in the party's books. Ms Baumeister says she gave it to him.</p> <p>Since it is known that the money was never entered in the party's books, the question of who took it from whom is crucial: the recipient can reasonably be suspected of a violation of the party funding laws, laws which the CDU itself put on the statute books.</p> <p>A public dispute over the issue was scarcely the way the Christian Democrats would have chosen to start the new political season.</p> <p>But yesterday's confrontation highlighted other reasons why the affair remains so damaging. The first, and most important, is that the \"Kohl affair\" is not just Mr Kohl's affair. It was first described as such at the end of November last year when the former chancellor admitted to having run a network of secret accounts to receive undisclosed donations.</p> <p>Mr Kohl, who headed the German government for 16 years, has admitted to having taken DM2m in illegal contributions between 1993 and 1998. But, as subsequent developments have shown, that was merely a fraction of what the CDU as a whole accepted.</p> <p>The involvement of Mr Sch\u00e4uble has demonstrated that he and other senior party officials took money, sometimes - as was the case with Mr Schreiber's donation - in cash. That is to say, in notes stuffed into envelopes.</p> <p>In Hesse, just one of Germany's 16 regions, party officials have acknowledged that some \u00a36.8m was secretly funnelled through another set of clandestine accounts.</p> <p>Yet what this week's events have also shown is that, while the Kohl affair may no longer be Mr Kohl's affair, the CDU remains very much Mr Kohl's party.

      "bodyText": "It has disappeared from the international headlines. Even in Germany, it has been eclipsed this summer by a running controversy over what to do with the far right. But, as events this week have made clear, the \"Kohl affair\" remains central to German politics. More than nine months after it erupted, it still has the ability to cause immense embarrassment to the country's main opposition party, the Christian Democrat Union (CDU), which Helmut Kohl led for 25 years. Yesterday, Germans were riveted by the sight of two of the party's leading figures, Mr Kohl's successor as leader, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, and the party's former treasurer, Brigitte Baumeister, giving utterly contradictory accounts of a key episode to a parliamentary inquiry. Their appearance before the panel arose from a DM100,000 (\u00a335,000) donation to the party's funds by Karlheinz Schreiber, the millionaire businessman whose allegations about other contributions sparked off the whole affair. Mr Sch\u00e4uble, who lost the party leadership as a result of the scandal, and Ms Baumeister both claimed they personally received the money. Mr Sch\u00e4uble said he had then passed it on to Ms Baumeister so that she could enter it in the party's books. Ms Baumeister says she gave it to him. Since it is known that the money was never entered in the party's books, the question of who took it from whom is crucial: the recipient can reasonably be suspected of a violation of the party funding laws, laws which the CDU itself put on the statute books. A public dispute over the issue was scarcely the way the Christian Democrats would have chosen to start the new political season. But yesterday's confrontation highlighted other reasons why the affair remains so damaging. The first, and most important, is that the \"Kohl affair\" is not just Mr Kohl's affair. It was first described as such at the end of November last year when the former chancellor admitted to having run a network of secret accounts to receive undisclosed donations. Mr Kohl, who headed the German government for 16 years, has admitted to having taken DM2m in illegal contributions between 1993 and 1998. But, as subsequent developments have shown, that was merely a fraction of what the CDU as a whole accepted. The involvement of Mr Sch\u00e4uble has demonstrated that he and other senior party officials took money, sometimes - as was the case with Mr Schreiber's donation - in cash. That is to say, in notes stuffed into envelopes. In Hesse, just one of Germany's 16 regions, party officials have acknowledged that some \u00a36.8m was secretly funnelled through another set of clandestine accounts. Yet what this week's events have also shown is that, while the Kohl affair may no longer be Mr Kohl's affair, the CDU remains very much Mr Kohl's party. Mr Sch\u00e4uble and his successor, the current leader, Angela Merkel, have both tried to distance the party from its disgraced former boss. But, after quarter of a century in charge of the CDU, the ex-chancellor's residual influence is immense. Time and again in recent months, it has emerged that Mr Kohl was active behind the scenes, holding talks with key officials before crucial developments in the CDU's recent, tortured history. Just before the summer recess it was revealed that he had even set up a meeting with the party's representatives on the inquiry committee before he himself gave evidence. In an interview before this week's session of the committee, Mr Sch\u00e4uble implied that Mr Kohl's machinations were responsible for his own involvement in the scandal. \"My credibility was systematically destroyed by a finely woven network of intrigues\", he said. The former chancellor twice met Ms Baumeister earlier this year. He was known to be furious about Mr Sch\u00e4uble's attempts, though timid and belated, to distance himself and the party from the scandal. And, of course, Mr Kohl had every reason for wanting to widen it; for hoping that it could be turned from the \"Kohl affair\" into something altogether broader and messier.",

      "body": "<p>In Britain we no longer expect to suffer from illnesses associated with malnutrition, poverty and the dark ages of medicine. But news last week that the incidence of rickets among children is increasing suggests that our confidence may have been misplaced. Dr Zulf Mughal of St Mary's hospital in Manchester believes that many cases are missed by doctors unfamiliar with a condition not routinely seen in Britain for more than 50 years. \"If you are attuned to the problem, if you walk around any area with high immigration, you often see children walking with a funny-looking gait that could well be rickets,\" he says. </p> <p>Rickets is not the only \"dead\" ailment to be undergoing a revival. </p> <p>There are 30 diseases which must be reported to the authorities under the public health (infectious dis eases) regulations of 1988: alongside cholera and the plague are conditions such as measles and rubella, which were declining thanks to immunisation. </p> <p>However, an outbreak of measles in Dublin this year showed how these \"declining\" diseases can escape medical control: two people died and 100 were hospitalised. Concerns about the safety of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine led to some parents deciding not to immunise their children and so measles returned. The World Health Organisation states that a vaccination rate of 95% is necessary to guarantee protection of the population. In Britain, the rate has fallen to 88.4%. </p> <p><strong> Rickets </strong></p> <p>\"All nutritionists learn about rickets, but it's taught that it's pretty much a Third World problem,\" says Sarah Schenker of the British Nutrition Foundation. This disorder - the result of vitamin D deficiency which causes growing bones to weaken and bend - was thought to have been eliminated in the 50s. Professor Barbara Mawer of the Manchester Royal Infirmary is one expert who has noted its return. She has seen around 30 cases in the past two years and believes that, nationally, there may be hundreds. Asian children are thought to be most at risk: vegetarian diets could be partly to blame (vitamin D occurs naturally only in animal products, although it is, by law, added to margarine), as could dress codes which hide the skin from sunlight, a crucial source of vitamin D. \"Our advice is to make sure that you get at least half an hour of daily exposure, at least on the face, hands and arms,\" says Schenker. \"It's quite worrying to think that children might not be getting even that. If we're developing into a nation that simply sits inside, it is bound to have detrimental effects.\" </p> <p><strong> Tuberculosis </strong><br> </p> <p> A survey by the public health laboratory service (PHLS) of medical professionals has placed TB fifth on the list of health priorities in the UK today, above E coli and hepatitis. \"We do see cases and the numbers are rising,\" says Marjorie Monnickendam of the PHLS. \"It became less common, so people don't think that TB could be a possible explanation of their symptoms.\" Some of these, particularly a persistent cough, can be misdiagnosed as a more common complaint, such as asthma. Between 1948 and 1987, TB cases dropped tenfold; since, the decline has stopped and numbers are rising: from 5,204 reported cases in 1990, to 6,144 last year, killing around 400. Around 70% of children are vaccinated, but in the mid-90s many escaped the needle due to a lack of BCG vaccine. As the TB bacterium can survive in the body for years before stress - caused by homelessness, age or illness, for example - activates it, a decline in vaccination levels could be just what the germ has been waiting for. </p> <p><strong> Tetanus </strong><br> </p> <p> Tetanus can never be eradicated. The only effective guard against the disease, which attacks the central nervous system causing painful muscular contractions and lockjaw, is immunisation. Tetanus jabs, along with those for diptheria, pertussis (whooping cough), polio and meningococcal type C, are given to babies from the age of two months, and are - or should be - reinforced with booster injections every 10 years. Three cases of tetanus were reported to the PHLS last year. </p> <p>Earlier this month, however, 10-year-old Tyla Green was admitted to hospital with tetanus, the first child in Britain to contract the disease for more than a decade. \"It's very rare,\" says Monnickendam. \"We don't see very many cases, and most of those tend to be in elderly people who were not vaccinated when they were younger.\" Ninety-six percent of children are now immunised thanks to widespread vaccination programmes, but then so was Tyla Green. </p> <p><strong> Diphtheria </strong><br> </p> <p> Ten years ago, in England and Wales, there were two reported cases of diphtheria, which was supposed to have been \"conquered\" after mass immunisation began 60 years ago. By last year, there were 23. Time to panic? No, says Monnickendam. \"Diphtheria is basically a throat infection, and can produce toxins which damage the heart and nerves. But many [diphtheria] bugs don't produce these toxins.\" In 1998, for example, of 23 recorded cases, 21 were non-toxic, a variant thought to account for the steady increase in cases since 1992. </p> <p><strong> Whooping cough </strong><br> </p> <p> The number of reported cases of pertussis, to give it its technical name, has fallen from 15,286 in 1990 to 1,139 last year. The fatality ratio, though, has crept up from 0.05 deaths per 100 notifications in 1990, to 0.25 per 100 by the end of the decade. So why has it become more dangerous? Monnickendam says that it is most serious under six months and most of those who die have not been immunised. Some doctors believe that official figures do not reflect the prevalence of whooping cough: one 1997 study in a large suburban practice identified enough cases to indicate a nationwide rate of 330 per 100,000 people; the official rate is fewer than four per 100,000. </p> <p>Another study in 1996 suggested that as many as two-thirds of whooping cough cases go unreported.</p>",

      "body": "<p>From the moment she started breastfeeding her newborn son, Sue Harrison knew that there was something wrong. \"When I held Richard, he struggled,\" she says. \"He couldn't bear me to cuddle him. I ended up feeding him propped up on a cushion underneath me. I already had two daughters who were four and three when Richard was born and I kept thinking, 'Why is he like this? What am I doing differently?' \" </p> <p>For the first four years of Richard's life, he screamed throughout the night. He had no interest in toys and walked round the living room in circles for hours, clutching his bottle. \"He would never say, 'Look at this, mummy.' He was in his own little world,\" says Sue. \"When he went to school, his teachers said he was withdrawn. He had no friends. His behaviour at home was terrible. He had screaming fits and temper tantrums. I kept saying to his teachers that he wasn't right. They thought he had learning difficulties.\" </p> <p>A psychologist said he had problems at school; the local child and family psychiatric service said he had emotional problems at home. In the end it was Richard himself, at the age of nine, who made the diagnosis. \"I had a poster stuck on the fridge from the National Autistic Society because my three-year-old nephew had recently been diagnosed with autism,\" says Sue. \"It showed pin men with words underneath describing autistic behaviour.\" The examples included \"does not play with other children\", \"indicates needs by using an adult's hand\", \"inappropriate giggling or laughing\" and \"lack of pretend play\". </p> <p>\"I was on the phone and I could hear him reading the poster out loud and saying, 'I do that, I do that, I do that.' He pulled me, saying, 'Come now, come now,' and showed me the poster, saying again, 'I do that.' I said to him, 'Yes, you do.' \" </p> <p>A second opinion from the Early Years Assessment Centre in Nottingham confirmed that Richard had austistic spectrum disorder, an umbrella term for a number of disorders of varying severity that include autism and Asperger's syndrome. These disorders, four times more common in boys than in girls, are thought to be the result of abnormal development of the brain. Genetic factors are implicated. Two thirds of children with the disorders have learning difficulties. Children with Asperger's syndrome have average or above-average intelligence and can often speak fluently. Children with severe autism may be unable to speak and have severe behavioural problems. </p> <p>Autism is defined by a triad of impairments, in interaction, communication and imagination. Children may seem aloof and uninterested in people and may not be able to articulate how they feel or understand emotions. They may be able to repeat words they hear but not use them in other situations. If children engage in pretend play it may be rigid and repetitive. </p> <p>\"Richard has to go through lots of rituals before he goes to bed,\" says Sue. \"Every night when he hears the normal noises in the house he will keep repeating, 'What's that, what's that?' \" </p> <p>Realising Richard has an autistic spectrum disorder, however, has helped the family enormously. \"It's not a label, it's a diagnosis that has helped us to understand him. His teenage sisters used to think he was a pain. They would say to me, 'Mum, why can't you do anything with him?' Now they know.\" </p> <p>Although the delay in diagnosing Richard's disorder is extreme, some delay is common. A survey by the National Autistic Society last year of 2,300 of its members showed that the diagnosis of 65% had been delayed for three or more years. \"We found that 10% waited 10 years or more,\" says Jeanette Lyons, the society's spokeswoman. \"Some were difficult diagnoses, but many parents told us that GPs had told them their children would grow out of it.\" </p> <p>No one knows how many children have autistic spectrum disorder because there is no central register. Most estimates range from four to 30 per 10,000. Some researchers believe the number might be one in 100 including its most subtle forms. </p> <p>In America, concern that children with the disorder are being missed and denied early help is such that an expert panel from the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society last week recommended that all children should be screened for autism. The panel looked at evidence from 2,750 studies and concluded that toddlers should be screened for autism at regular developmental checks. In the UK, children are developmentally assessed at 18 months, but the milestones tested are mostly physical (brick-building and holding pencils) and do not include social and communication skills. </p> <p>The panel suggest using the Chat (Checklist for Autism in Toddlers) questionnaire, which takes five minutes to administer. It asks parents whether their child plays peek-a-boo, shows them toys and takes an interest in other children. Doctors note whether the child makes eye contact during the assessment and whether they can interest the child in play. </p> <p>The panel also says doctors should screen children when parents are worried about their development. Studies show that up to 80% of parents who are persistently concerned that their child has a developmental problem are shown to be right. </p> <p>Dr David Goldberg, an epidemiologist in Glasgow, believes an early diagnosis is important because it can take so long for parents to get the help they need. His son Adam was diagnosed as having an autistic spectrum disorder at the age of two, after doctors had initially said that Adam would grow out of his problems. \"It was important that he had an early diagnosis because it was still a battle to get the education and the care we wanted for him.\" </p> <p>Adam is now in a residential school for children with autism and is doing well. \"We believe that he has had the best opportunity to reach his full potential,\" says Dr Goldberg. \"You can't get rid of autism. It is a fundamental disorder. But the early diag nosis helped us to deal with lots of his behavioural problems. We knew how to handle his toilet training, whereas we hear of children whose diagnosis was delayed who are still soiling and antisocial when they are older.\" </p> <p>Judith Gould, director of the Centre for Social and Communication Disorders, says that early intervention can improve IQ and enhance social skills. \"Once we start tackling children's behavioural problems then they get less frustrated and have fewer temper tantrums,\" says Dr Gould. \"The trouble is that doctors aren't trained to recognise these disorders and still sometimes don't listen to parents' concerns that something is wrong with their child.\" </p> <p>Dr Tony Charman, of the Institute of Child Health, is part of a team that has used Chat to screen for autism in toddlers. By following up these toddlers over eight years, it found it had identified between 20% and 40% of children who had autism. \"It's not a very sensitive test, so it could be argued that it's not worth using it for screening,\" says Dr Charman. \"But if the costs are not too high and parents do not get overanxious at being told their child might have a problem we need to monitor, it could help identify children with autism.\" </p> <p>The American expert panel is keen to apply the test to all toddlers and urges doctors to look for signs of autism from 12 months onwards, when lack of babbling may suggest a problem. </p> <p>\"Early diagnosis helps children with autism,\" says Stephen Ashwal, a member of the US panel and head of the paediatric neurology department at the Loma Linda School of Medicine. \"This is the kind of disorder that one would rather overdiagnose so a child can be followed carefully and receive the benefits of therapy. The concern has been that one might upset parents. But most professionals working with such children realise that parents prefer timely and accurate answers to their concerns.\" </p> <p>In Britain, the all-party parliamentary group on autism already supports early diagnosis. </p> <p>\"Our understanding is that the type of intervention is not critical so long as children get behavioural support,\" says Dr Stephen Ladyman, MP for South Thanet and chairman of the group. \"Doing something here will be better than nothing.

If your son is excessively short (in the smallest 0.4% for his age) or appears not to be thriving, your GP will refer you to a growth specialist.

It's hardly ever inherited so there is no particular reason for you to develop it. Most people worried that their memory is going are actually a bit depressed. Because Alzheimer's causes gradual disorientation, the sufferer is usually the last to be aware of his or her symptoms. Your GP will be able to ask you a series of questions to test your memory, carry out some simple urine and blood tests and refer you to a specialist if dementia is suspected.

First, make sure your son can hear and arrange hearing tests with your GP if you are concerned. If he plays imaginatively, interacts with you and other adults and children, can walk, run and kick a ball and understands what you say to him, he is unlikely to have any developmental delay or autism.

Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, testifying before a parliamentary inquiry into Germany's biggest post-war political scandal, said he thought Mr Kohl was behind a \"finely woven network of intrigues\" used to deflect attention from the affair. Mr Sch\u00e4uble, who for a long time was Mr Kohl's top lieutenant in the Christian Democratic party and succeeded him as CDU chairman before being forced to resign in March, said: \"Everything that happened reminded me of an intrigue.\" He added that the CDU's former treasurer, Brigitte Baumeister, and a fugitive German-Canadian arms dealer had often revised their stories as part of a plot to undermine him. Mr Sch\u00e4uble also said in newspaper interviews that he would fight attempts by Mr Kohl and his allies to pull him into the finance scandal. \"I'm not going to be dragged into that mud,\" he said. Mr Sch\u00e4uble, who has become Mr Kohl's arch enemy, said he had taken millions of marks from the CDU's parliamentary group in the early 1980s and transferred the money to the CDU headquarters, where it disappeared. He said the transfer of the funds to the party headquarters from dues-paying CDU deputies was legal. \"The interesting question is what did Helmut Kohl do with this money after it was fed into his system of slush funds?\" Mr Sch\u00e4uble told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper. He said he did not know what happened to the cash after it went to the party headquarters. Mr Kohl, chancellor for 16 years, has admitted accepting DM2m (\u00a3628,000) in illegal campaign contributions between 1993 and 1998, but refuses to name the donors. The scandal, which has stained Mr Kohl's standing as a leading European statesman, has ripped apart the CDU. The conservative wing of the party has been trying to rehabilitate the former chancellor in recent months, arguing that his historical achievement as architect of German unification in 1990 outweighs his transgressions in violating campaign funding laws. But reformers in the party, including the CDU leader, Angela Merkel, are trying to keep Mr Kohl, 70, on the sidelines. Some CDU leaders want to keep him away from the centre of the party's decision-making until he reveals the names of the secret donors. Mr Sch\u00e4uble was forced to resign over discrepancies that emerged about whether he or Ms Baumeister accepted a DM100,000 (\u00a331,000) donation from an arms dealer, Karlheinz Schreiber. Ms Baumeister said she took the donation from Mr Schreiber in 1994. Mr Sch\u00e4uble repeated yesterday that he had received the money. Although it appears to be a minor disagreement over who took the cash from Mr Schreiber - as both say they then turned it over to the party coffers - it was nevertheless used to pressure Mr Sch\u00e4uble to resign. He accused Mr Kohl, who met Ms Baumeister twice earlier this year, of being responsible for a smear campaign against him. \"My credibility was systematically destroyed by a finely woven network of intrigues,\" Mr Sch\u00e4uble said. Reuters \u0095 Germany took a big step towards liberalising its retail industry yesterday when 16 regional governments backed a plan to extend store hours and eliminate years of strict regulation.

      "bodyText": "The government is facing an embarrassing double setback to its plans to suppress intelligence reports in the case of Paul and John Grecian, former directors of Ordtec, who were prosecuted for illegally selling military equipment to President Saddam Hussein. The two men are suing customs and excise for millions of pounds in damages for malicious prosecution after the appeal court overturned the conviction of Paul Grecian and charges against his father, John, were dropped during plea bargaining. Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, was accused of hypocrisy when he used gagging orders - public interest immunity certificates (PIIs) - to suppress the texts of four intelligence reports. While in opposition he lambasted the Tories for signing such orders, which led to Paul Grecian's imprisonment in the first place. Although Mr Cook has said that the sole reason for withholding the documents was to protect their sources, he refused to hand them over with the names of sources blanked out. His decision is backed by Jack Straw the home secretary, who has forbidden the Grecians access to further intelligence reports in the case. Now two developments threaten to undermine the government's case. Article 8 of the new Human Rights Act which comes into force on October 2, and a ruling from Elizabeth France, the data protection commissioner, giving the public the right to ask to see security files on them, will let the Grecians' lawyers ask for seek these and any other documents held by the security services relating to the father and son. A law lords' ruling on July 27 will also weaken customs and excise ability to mounta successful defence against the Grecians. It let four people, led by David Darker, prosecute the West Midlands police for conspiring to fabricate evidence against them. The Grecians' lawyers will use it to apply to the courts in November for permission to bring accusations of abuse of power against customs and excise. Such allegations only require proof of malice: the absence of an honest belief in guilt is not necessary. The West Midlands police claimed immunity from prosecution after the trial of Mr Darker and three others for alleged drug trafficking and forgery of travellers' cheques collapsed because evidence had been fabricated by the police. The case went to law lords, who ruled that because the police fabricated the evidence, immunity from prosecution should be withdrawn. The five judges ruled that \"in determining the scope of witness immunity, the predominant requirement of public policy was that those who suffered a wrong should have a right to a remedy\" and it should not extend to the \"wrongful purpose of fabricating false evidence which would be referred to in an untruthful statement of evidence\". Lord Hutton quoted Sir Richard Scott, the judge who headed the Arms to Iraq inquiry, as saying \"The police and the crown prosecution service, like everyone else, are subject in the discharge of their duties to the rule of law. There is no public interest that requires them to afforded immunity against actions based on malicious or knowing abuses of their powers.\" Lawrence Kormornick of Dechert, the Grecians' lawyer, said: \"The Darker case is an important landmark human rights decision that apart from evidence in court and witness statements, the police and other investigation authorities and prosecution authorities no longer have absolute immunity from suit for actions alleging conspiracy to injure and misfeasance in public office. \"The House of Lords now seems to be saying that investigators and prosecutors like everyone else, are subject to the rule of law and they should not have immunity against actions based on malicious or knowing abuses of their powers unless absolutely necessary. \"This decision is to be welcomed, it should enable many more victims of injustice to obtain compensation by relying on abuse of public office rather than having to prove malicious prosecution.\"",

      "bodyText": "Europe is losing the war against drugs, according to intelligence reports from the US Drug Enforcement Administration obtained by the Guardian. The reports reveal dramatic increases in drug production - from poppy crops used to make heroin in Afghanistan, to the manufacture of ecstasy in the Netherlands - and police forces stretched thin while trying to cope with Europe's porous borders. The drug traffickers have been so successful that they have compiled huge hidden stockpiles throughout western and eastern Europe to ensure an uninterrupted supply. An increase in drug seizures throughout Europe and Asia is interpreted not as effective policing, but as a sign of increasing volumes. The DEA is especially critical of the policies of the Netherlands government, expressing scepticism about the effectiveness of its liberal approach. It describes the Netherlands as \"perhaps the most important drug trafficking and transiting area in Europe\". Trends in the drug trade, it says, undermine the Dutch government's policy of discriminating between \"soft\" and \"hard\" drugs. DEA reports on 10 countries, from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Albania, Serbia-Montenegro, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Netherlands, were obtained by the Guardian during the past six months through the US Freedom of Information Act. They provide the most up-to-date information on the changing supply routes from the golden crescent countries - Afghanistan and Pakistan - to Europe. The traditional route through the Balkans was disrupted by conflict throughout the 1990s, particularly the war in Kosovo last year. While variations on the route, using Croatia and Macedonia, have been adopted, much of that trade has shifted to the north. Routes that emerged after the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 are now witnessing the biggest volume of drug trafficking, especially through the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. The DEA emphasises that the lifting of border restrictions within the European Union under the Schengen agreement, which Britain opted out of, has made life easier for drug traffickers. \"Although this agreement is advantageous for trade, it is also attractive to drug traffickers,\" the report says. In one especially pessimistic passage, the DEA concludes that drug traffickers have built up stockpiles that allow them to ensure smooth supplies. \"In the last few years, heroin has been increasingly stockpiled in some western and eastern European locations, enabling west European travellers to take delivery of the drug closer to home,\" it says. \"Turkish heroin trafficking organisations work in collusion with nationals from eastern Europe who have established heroin depots to store large quantities of heroin and release it on demand. \"These storage facilities ensure a steady, uninterrupted drug supply to west European consumers.\" A report on the Netherlands, prepared by the intelligence division of the DEA and dated June 2000, says that Amsterdam is \"rather unique in that every type of drug-smuggling and distribution organisation is represented for strategic and logistical purposes. It is an organisational centre, a central brokerage point and a safe haven.\" Among the 100 groups which are active in drug trafficking in Amsterdam are Turks, Colombians, Kurds, Chinese, Nigerians, Israelis, Moroccans, British and Irish. The Netherlands is the world's biggest producer of ecstasy, a \"designer drug\" that is a mixture of amphetamine and mescaline. The DEA says: \"The United States is increasingly a target of MDMA [ecstasy] traffickers. Quantities of ecstasy tablets are routinely smuggled to the US by air courier or in postal or express-mail packages. The DEA's Hague office recorded the seizure of more than 3.5m ecstasy tablets between January and October 1999 destined for the US market (seized in both the United States and Europe). The Netherlands is also the main source in Europe for amphetamines, with virtually all shipments going to Britain, Germany or Scandinavia. The DEA also estimates that 75% of the heroin arriving in the Netherlands is for onward shipment throughout Europe and north America. In contrast with the official approach of the Netherlands government, which differentiates between hard and soft drug traffickers, the DEA notes: \"Dutch hashish traffickers are increasingly distributing heroin, cocaine and amphetamine to other countries. This 'poly-drug' activity is being encountered more and more frequently.\" Smuggling is carried out by rail, air and post, but mainly by road in private cars, commercial buses and - the most popular method - in large container trucks.

The DEA says: \"Reports of heroin shipments north from Afghanistan through the central Asian states to Russia have increased. Tajikistan is reported to be a favourite destination for both opium and heroin shipments.\" Russia acts as both a consumer and transit point. The usual destination for shipments from the central Asian states is Turkey, which \"plays a significant role in the conversion of opiates from source countries in south-west Asia and the trans-shipment of heroin to the worldwide market, particularly Europe\". It is estimated that four to six metric tonnes of heroin is either processed or transits through Turkey each month.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On Monday, the England selectors named the following squads for England's winter tours of Kenya, Pakistan and Sri Lanka:</p> <p><strong>Test Squad</strong> Nasser Hussain (c), Michael Atherton, Andrew Caddick, Dominic Cork, Andrew Flintoff, Ashley Giles, Darren Gough, Graeme Hick, Matthew Hoggard, Paul Nixon, Ian Salisbury, Alec Stewart, Marcus Trescothick, Graham Thorpe, Michael Vaughan, Craig White. </p> <p><strong>One-day Squad</strong> Hussain (c), Mark Alleyne, Caddick, Mark Ealham, Flintoff, Giles, Gough, Hick, Nick Knight, Alan Mullally, Stewart, Trescothick, Thorpe, White. </p> <p>Before the announcement was made, this is how Wisden's <strong>Lawrence Booth</strong> foresaw the selections:</p> <p>On Monday England announce their tour parties for the ICC Knockout Trophy in Kenya and the Test series in Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Selection for the one-day side is straightforward: take the team that won the NatWest Series this summer and add on Nick Knight, who missed the triangular triumph through injury. It's selection for the Test squad that could cause more headaches.</p> <p>Because the squads will be named before the fifth Test against West Indies, the Oval game will for once be more of a showcase than a last-minute trial. The XI who won at Headingley should be on the plane - and it's safe to assume they will be. But England want to play a spinner at The Oval, and they'll need to take two with them this winter to make the most of the subcontinent's array of bunsens.</p> <p>For the sake of variety, one must turn it away from the right-hander and one into him. Pakistan and Sri Lankan batsmen play slow bowlers as well as anyone, and England do not have a legspinner good enough to worry them. Ian Salisbury (19 Test wickets at 70.84) has demonstrated this time and again; Chris Schofield (18-2-73-0) demonstrated it at Trent Bridge against Zimbabwe. So they need to take a left-armer instead. </p> <p>Phil Tufnell is still winkling out wickets for Middlesex, but his recent record away from home is poor: on his last two trips - to South Africa over the winter and West Indies three years ago - the Cat has snared just 13 Test wickets in 383.3 overs. That's a wicket every 177 balls. He's not the best tourist off the field either. Which paves the way for Ashley Giles. He's having a great season with Warwickshire and, unlike Tuffers, can score first-class centuries. He's unlikely to have Yousuf Youhana and Sanath Jayasuriya quaking in their boots, but England don't have much choice.</p> <p>The offspinner should be Jason Brown of Northamptonshire, who takes five-fors on helpful wickets as often as Inzamam-ul-Haq is involved in run-outs. The principal advantage Brown has over Robert Croft and Peter Such is his age - 25. A career first-class average of 23.95 (to Croft's 36.01 and Such's 29.74) says he's a better bowler too, and England need to find out quickly just how good he really is (Bob Woolmer, for one, thinks he's very good). Now's their chance.</p> <p>That leaves three vacancies. England need a spare batsman, a spare bowler and, despite Alec Stewart's recent heroics, a spare keeper. The batting spot is a tricky one. England should be looking for someone who knows his googly from his doosra to go with the top seven who scored 272 on a seaming track at Headingley. In the <a href=\"http://www.wisden.com/Wisden_Cricket_Monthly/0,5654,73615,00.html\">September issue</a> of Wisden Cricket Monthly Peter Such names the best five players of spin in the country. Graeme Hick and Nasser Hussain are certainties to tour, Tony Cottey is a certainty not to, while John Crawley and Mark Ramprakash are probably fighting for the final place. </p> <p>This is a tough call, but it's the sort Australia have to make all the time, so let's not get too down. Both men are scoring runs at the right time and, although Ramps didn't cut it at the top of the order against Walsh and Ambrose, that doesn't mean he shouldn't return in the middle. On his last tour with England - ignoring SOS calls at Christmas - he topped the Test averages (47.37) with four half-centuries in ten innings against Australia. Crawley scored 86 runs in six innings. It's harsh on a man who belted 156* the last time he faced Muttiah Muralitharan, but Crawley's going to have to wait.</p> <p>The extra bowler should be Alex Tudor. His Test debut at Perth, when he got rid of the Waugh twins, was too good to let him slip through the system, and that 99* last summer revealed more class with the bat than Craig White has ever had. Forget the fact that he bowls no-balls sometimes: Darren Gough does it all the time, so does Wasim Akram. Just let him bowl fast and watch the Pakistanis hop around.</p> <p>The wicketkeeping slot should go to Jack Russell. He says he's retired from international cricket, but when you can perform as well as he still does - standing up to Gloucestershire's fast-medium seamers and eking out valuable runs - England ought to persuade him otherwise. Then there's the irritation factor: imagine Russell and Dominic Cork batting together, one of them harassing the fielders with singles that don't exist, the other exhibiting leave-alones that only Courtney Walsh would dare. It would drive Pakistan spare. Chris Read should go with the A team to West Indies, which is currently the hardest place to keep wicket this side of Mars. He'll play regularly, learn a lot and may then be ready to replace Stewart - if he ever retires.</p> <p>All of which means no place for Andrew Flintoff. His back hasn't mended properly yet, and if he can't be relied on to bowl between 10 and 15 overs a day he shouldn't be in the side, as his batting alone doesn't merit a place. The captaincy of the A side might be a good way to focus the mind, let alone his body.</p> <p><strong>My England XVI for the Pakistan and Sri Lanka Test series</strong> Mike Atherton, Marcus Trescothick, Nasser Hussain (c), Graham Thorpe, Alec Stewart (wk), Michael Vaughan, Graeme Hick, Mark Ramprakash, Jack Russell (wk), Dominic Cork, Ashley Giles, Alex Tudor, Craig White, Andy Caddick, Darren Gough, Jason Brown.</p> <p><em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com</em></p>",

Because the squads will be named before the fifth Test against West Indies, the Oval game will for once be more of a showcase than a last-minute trial. The XI who won at Headingley should be on the plane - and it's safe to assume they will be. But England want to play a spinner at The Oval, and they'll need to take two with them this winter to make the most of the subcontinent's array of bunsens. For the sake of variety, one must turn it away from the right-hander and one into him. Pakistan and Sri Lankan batsmen play slow bowlers as well as anyone, and England do not have a legspinner good enough to worry them. Ian Salisbury (19 Test wickets at 70.84) has demonstrated this time and again; Chris Schofield (18-2-73-0) demonstrated it at Trent Bridge against Zimbabwe. So they need to take a left-armer instead. Phil Tufnell is still winkling out wickets for Middlesex, but his recent record away from home is poor: on his last two trips - to South Africa over the winter and West Indies three years ago - the Cat has snared just 13 Test wickets in 383.3 overs. That's a wicket every 177 balls. He's not the best tourist off the field either. Which paves the way for Ashley Giles. He's having a great season with Warwickshire and, unlike Tuffers, can score first-class centuries. He's unlikely to have Yousuf Youhana and Sanath Jayasuriya quaking in their boots, but England don't have much choice. The offspinner should be Jason Brown of Northamptonshire, who takes five-fors on helpful wickets as often as Inzamam-ul-Haq is involved in run-outs. The principal advantage Brown has over Robert Croft and Peter Such is his age - 25. A career first-class average of 23.95 (to Croft's 36.01 and Such's 29.74) says he's a better bowler too, and England need to find out quickly just how good he really is (Bob Woolmer, for one, thinks he's very good). Now's their chance. That leaves three vacancies. England need a spare batsman, a spare bowler and, despite Alec Stewart's recent heroics, a spare keeper. The batting spot is a tricky one. England should be looking for someone who knows his googly from his doosra to go with the top seven who scored 272 on a seaming track at Headingley. In the September issue of Wisden Cricket Monthly Peter Such names the best five players of spin in the country. Graeme Hick and Nasser Hussain are certainties to tour, Tony Cottey is a certainty not to, while John Crawley and Mark Ramprakash are probably fighting for the final place. This is a tough call, but it's the sort Australia have to make all the time, so let's not get too down. Both men are scoring runs at the right time and, although Ramps didn't cut it at the top of the order against Walsh and Ambrose, that doesn't mean he shouldn't return in the middle. On his last tour with England - ignoring SOS calls at Christmas - he topped the Test averages (47.37) with four half-centuries in ten innings against Australia. Crawley scored 86 runs in six innings. It's harsh on a man who belted 156* the last time he faced Muttiah Muralitharan, but Crawley's going to have to wait. The extra bowler should be Alex Tudor. His Test debut at Perth, when he got rid of the Waugh twins, was too good to let him slip through the system, and that 99* last summer revealed more class with the bat than Craig White has ever had. Forget the fact that he bowls no-balls sometimes: Darren Gough does it all the time, so does Wasim Akram. Just let him bowl fast and watch the Pakistanis hop around. The wicketkeeping slot should go to Jack Russell. He says he's retired from international cricket, but when you can perform as well as he still does - standing up to Gloucestershire's fast-medium seamers and eking out valuable runs - England ought to persuade him otherwise. Then there's the irritation factor: imagine Russell and Dominic Cork batting together, one of them harassing the fielders with singles that don't exist, the other exhibiting leave-alones that only Courtney Walsh would dare. It would drive Pakistan spare. Chris Read should go with the A team to West Indies, which is currently the hardest place to keep wicket this side of Mars. He'll play regularly, learn a lot and may then be ready to replace Stewart - if he ever retires. All of which means no place for Andrew Flintoff. His back hasn't mended properly yet, and if he can't be relied on to bowl between 10 and 15 overs a day he shouldn't be in the side, as his batting alone doesn't merit a place. The captaincy of the A side might be a good way to focus the mind, let alone his body.

The results have also renewed concerns that humans not displaying vCJD symptoms but incubating the condition may infect others undergoing medical or dental procedures.</p> <p>Experiments on mice and hamsters have suggested that similar diseases could jump between species more easily than had been supposed and spread within species even when obvious symptoms are not yet evident.</p> <p>Although scientists in the field of BSE research have suspected this, Professor John Collinge, who headed the research funded by the medical research council, said its results could have important public health implications.</p> <p>The latest developments come amid signs that the incidence of vCJD is growing at between 20% and 30% a year. In Britain, 70 people have died and nine others are still alive suffering the always fatal condition. There have been two deaths in France and one in Ireland. All are thought to have been infected years ago through exposure to cheap meat from parts of cattle containing high concentrations of the agent responsible.</p> <p>Since 1989, the government has introduced a series of controls including a ban on certain offals entering food, a bar on all cattle over 30 months old being used for food, and an end to feeding cow and sheep remains to other meat-producing livestock.</p> <p>Anti-vCJD measures to lower the risk of spread between humans have included tighter restrictions on blood transfusions, more use of disposable surgical instruments and better sterilisation of other equipment.</p> <p>BSE-like diseases are believed to be caused by abnormal proteins, called prions, taking hold in previously healthy parts of the body's central nervous system.

      "bodyText": "Scientists are to re-examine controls against variant CJD, the deadly human form of BSE, in the wake of evidence that the disease might be highly infectious even when unwitting carriers do not display outward signs of suffering from the condition. They will also determine whether a new system of checks on sheep, pigs and chicken is needed to ensure that recently banned farming methods have not created other potentially fatal routes for BSE to enter humans. New research has raised fears that animals thought to be healthy and incapable of acquiring BSE could in theory pass the disease on. The results have also renewed concerns that humans not displaying vCJD symptoms but incubating the condition may infect others undergoing medical or dental procedures. Experiments on mice and hamsters have suggested that similar diseases could jump between species more easily than had been supposed and spread within species even when obvious symptoms are not yet evident. Although scientists in the field of BSE research have suspected this, Professor John Collinge, who headed the research funded by the medical research council, said its results could have important public health implications. The latest developments come amid signs that the incidence of vCJD is growing at between 20% and 30% a year. In Britain, 70 people have died and nine others are still alive suffering the always fatal condition. There have been two deaths in France and one in Ireland. All are thought to have been infected years ago through exposure to cheap meat from parts of cattle containing high concentrations of the agent responsible. Since 1989, the government has introduced a series of controls including a ban on certain offals entering food, a bar on all cattle over 30 months old being used for food, and an end to feeding cow and sheep remains to other meat-producing livestock. Anti-vCJD measures to lower the risk of spread between humans have included tighter restrictions on blood transfusions, more use of disposable surgical instruments and better sterilisation of other equipment. BSE-like diseases are believed to be caused by abnormal proteins, called prions, taking hold in previously healthy parts of the body's central nervous system. But \"species barriers\" between types of animal were believed to reduce the apparent potency. There was thought to be a high one between hamsters and mice. Prof Collinge's team, based at the MSC's prion unit and the Imperial College school of medicine at St Mary's Hospital, London, found that mice injected in the brain with hamster scrapie, a BSE-like disease, carried high levels of infectivity while living into old age and showing no outward signs. But when material from the brains of these mice was injected into other mice and hamsters, it eventually killed them. The suspicion is that the process created a new strain, or strains, of more virulent disease. The findings, published last night in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, will cause concern that contaminated material from people not displaying vCJD symptoms but incubating the condition may infect others undergoing medical or dental procedures through the use of contaminated instruments. Present sterilisation and cleaning techniques cannot remove all traces of the vCJD agent, although experts say they can substantially reduce levels of infectiousness. The new research will also reinforce suspicions that far more cattle have been infected than has been obvious and that scrapie in sheep, never known to have been harmful to humans, may have changed into a more dangerous strain by passing through cattle and back to sheep in the years when cannibalistic feeding practices were commonplace. So far BSE has not been known to have transferred to sheep or pigs outside the laboratory, but there are likely to be renewed calls for spot checks on healthy animals to see if their brains contain signs of the disease. Prof Collinge said: \"I don't want to raise alarms that that is likely, but we could check that quite easily so why don't we? We don't want to find this out later.\" He is a member of the government's spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee (Seac) which will consider the implications of the finding at the end of September. He does not think other new controls to stop infection from \"hidden BSE\" in cattle will be necessary, but he is \"not sure\". He said: \"My own view is that probably the 30-month rule and the offal ban would still protect us from that but I am not sure. This data shakes me up a bit.\" Professor Peter Smith, acting chairman of Seac, said the findings were of \"considerable interest\" but it was not clear that they indicated additional controls were needed. The Department of Health said: \"Current measures to protect public health from farm to healthcare were introduced on the basis that infection in animals and in people may be present in the absence of clinical diseases.\" The Ministry of Agriculture said: \"We believe the safeguards in place at the moment are adequate to deal with the issues Prof Collinge raises, but of course we will listen to what he has to say.\" Frances Hall, secretary of the Human BSE Foundation, whose son Peter died from variant CJD in 1996, said: \"We have always been worried that BSE might be in animals that aren't showing any symptoms. Subclinical animals can look perfectly fine, as can victims of human BSE before they get unwell.\" \u0095 French officials have discovered three new cases of mad cow disease, the country's agriculture ministry said in a statement yesterday.",

Each 10-minute service included two readings and a native American blessing. As each wedding concluded, well-wishers clapped, cheered and blew whistles in support. The couples then signed their \"wedding certificates\" and kissed. Barry Whyment-McCarthy and his partner Lewis, from Manchester, who have been together since December 19 last year, were the first to marry. \"We thought, where better place to get married?\" said Barry. One of their friends said: \"It was lovely, there were poofs crying all over the cobbles.\" Then Eddie and Darren Donothey, from Newcastle, who have been together for six years, tied the knot. Eddie said: \"We are both Coronation Street fans and it is almost historical for us to get married here.\" Edna Boughen and Barbara Jackson, from Hertford, said their vows after more than 26 years together. The couple won the \"wedding\" in an internet competition. \"Many gay couples feel the need to celebrate and affirm their relationships in the same way that heterosexual couples do,\" Mr Braunston said. \"Sadly, the law and most other churches do not recognise our relationships, and deny us the right to marry. These ceremonies at GayFest 2000 provided a wonderful opportunity to celebrate our love.\"",

      "bodyText": "First came Romance, Catherine Breillat's horrifying no-holds-barred look at contemporary sexual mores featuring masturbation, penetration and the truly extraordinary talent - if that's the word - of an Italian porn star called Rocco Siffredi. Then it was Baise Moi (which could be translated, politely, as Screw Me), Virgine Despentes's equally explicit but now banned film about a pair of sexually predatory females who have sex with an awful lot of men, largely played by porn actors, and then joyously murder most of them. So with the boundary between the art film and the sex film as good as non-existent in France, it comes as a pleasant surprise to see that a subject that would have lent itself perfectly to multiple and graphic close-ups of pink and sticky flesh has been treated with discretion. Released last week, Sade, directed by Benoit Jacquot and starring Daniel Auteuil as the man the French like to call the Divine Marquis, features no scenes of perverted sexual torture, no rapes, no murders and no coprophilia. The great 18th-century icon of debauchery is instead portrayed as a sane, humane and politically acceptable philosopher who was just a bit ahead of his time. In fact there's only one sex scene worthy of the name, in which the Marquis helps a young girl and a gardener to lose their virginity together; and that is so sensitively filmed that the Journal du Dimanche was moved to describe it as \"magnificent in substance, and sublime in form\". True, the Marquis de Sade, reviled author of 120 Days of Sodom and Justine or the Pains of Virtue, has been rehabilitated somewhat since the days - as late as the 1960s - when publishing his works was liable to land you in prison. The man whose name is synonymous with excessively violent sexual perversion is these days seen as something of a forgotten literary genius, a genuine if misunderstood advocate of human freedom, and a sadly persecuted victim who flew in the face of convention but delivered a few unpalatable home truths. There is a difference, intellectuals point out, between what De Sade did and what he wrote. The supposed notorious libertine in fact spent much of life in two different spells in prison, where he wrote the most sulphurous of his works, and there is no evidence to suggest that Comte Donatien Alphonse Fran\u00e7ois de Sade ever got up to anything naughtier than the average well-heeled nobleman of the day. Breillat herself argues that the violence expressed in his works is harmless, because it was merely fantasy. \"The imaginary has never hurt anyone,\" says the maker of Romance. \"On the contrary, it enables the release of impulses that are dangerous to repress.\" There is an almost mystical force in the way De Sade defied convention \"to the point of extreme aberration\", she claims. But there may be another reason for Mr Jacquot's sensitive and benign treatment of the Divine Marquis - and his depiction of Robespierre's revolutionaries gaily lopping off heads outside the prison gates as the true monsters. In a summer that has seen Hollywood blockbusters including X-Men, The Perfect Storm, Gladiator and Mission Impossible 2 dominate French cinema screens to the extent that domestic films accounted for only 7% of total tickets sold in August, the director of Sade probably just wanted a lot of people to see his movie. And despite the furore surrounding their release, the sexually explicit works of the likes of Breillat and Despentes have bombed at the box office. The naughty French, it seems, are altogether more romantically inclined than we scandal-loving Brits like to think.",

The reason why New Labour got into trouble over its claim to be spending large amounts on public services was that people could not verify the claim from their own experience. The observed reality of long hospital waiting times and over-crowded classrooms did not square with the hype so voters ended up by not believing the messenger. </p> <p>Voters have difficulty with the euro debate precisely because there is no clear means of verifying the claim that joining will improve things or the counter-claim that joining will make things worse. Personal experience is not much of a guide, although earlier this year many took the falling euro exchange rate as an indicator that the experiment was failing. It is hard to get independent advice from experts who people can trust because so many of them disagree. This is why so many people are sitting on the fence. </p> <p>So how likely is the public to take advice from the newspapers it reads? Does the press play a decisive role in influencing public opinion on this issue? The chart shows some interesting variations in newspaper readers' opinions. </p> <p>Attitudes and readership are clearly linked. To judge from its editorials and the way it presents the news, the most Eurosceptic paper is the Sun. And a clear majority of its readers want the UK to stay out of the euro. Among the least Eurosceptic of the metropolitan papers in its coverage and editorial line is the Guardian, with a major ity of its readers favouring UK membership. (Readers of the Independent, perhaps more enthusiastic than the Guardian, are less keen on joining, 37% saying join now, 19% not at all and 41% wait and see.) </p> <p>These associations could be explained either by readers' accepting their papers' editorial line or because they select papers which share their views. Thus the well-known Euroscepticism of the Murdoch press might explain the attitudes of Sun readers. But how then to explain why the Times's readership is much less Eurosceptic than the Sun's, even though the Murdoch flagship hardly espouses Euro-enthusiasm in its news or leader columns. Some 26% of readers of the Daily Telegraph favour joining and a further 40% say wait and see: so while the paper has strongly supported William Hague's Euroscepticism, two-thirds of its readers either in favour or are sitting on the fence. As for the Guardian its editorial view on joining is not clear yet its readers definitely favour membership. </p> <p>One underlying factor is social class. Some 25% of the middle class favour joining and 29% oppose. In contrast only 16% of the working class favour joining and 44% oppose. Thus the reason why Times and Daily Telegraph readers are less Eurosceptic than Sun readers is because they are more middle class. However, this is not the whole story because Sun readers and Daily Mirror readers have rather different attitudes, even though their class profiles are very similar. Some 27% of Mirror readers want to join and 38% say wait and see; only 32% are opposed to joining. </p> <p>There is a big educational gap in attitudes. Only 13% of individuals who left school at 16 favour membership, while no less than 41% of individuals who have gone through higher education are in this group. There is even a modest gender gap with 25% of men favouring membership and 19% of women. Clearly a number of other things explain attitudes on this issue in addition to newspaper readership and most of them relate to the individual's social status. The most secure, prosperous individuals favour membership and the least secure oppose it. </p> <p>Overall, the evidence suggests that because most people are sitting on the fence or don't know what to think, the campaign will decide the outcome of the referendum. It is likely that editorials will influence some voters once the campaign gets under way, but it is easy to exaggerate their importance. What is perhaps more important is the leadership shown by prominent individuals who have the trust of the voters and in this respect New Labour has lost a lot of ground in the credibility stakes over the last year. If Tony Blair is to give a lead on this issue, he has to hope that the general election will restore some of this credibility before the referendum campaign starts. </p> <p>Perhaps the most intriguing point is that class politics is alive and well and can be found in the debate about UK membership of the euro. If marked differences in attitude between the social classes are not addressed in the referendum campaign, then supporters of UK membership are going to have a tough time winning the argument. </p> <p>Paul Whiteley is director of the Economic and Social Research Council programme on democracy and participation.<br>P.Whiteley@sheffield.ac.uk</p>",

There's nothing unique about Nottingham Trent.\" Whitbread will invest \u00a36m in developing the hotel on land owned by the university in a private finance initiative scheme. Turnover will be shared between the leisure group and the university, with the cost of the lease being linked to the hotel's success. Whitbread will build a health and leisure centre on the campus which can only be used by the students. \"It will enable us to offer value-for-money accommodation for our long-distance students and conference delegates,\" the university's director of estates and resources, Ged O'Donoghue, said. It is expected that most of the guests, who are likely to have to pay \u00a346.95 for a double room, will be post-graduate students attending short courses together with students' parents unwilling to contend with their offsprings' hard floors and standards of hygiene. Last year an estimated 3,000 post-grads attended three- or four-day courses at the university, but clientele will not be restricted to those connected with the university. \"Obviously, the university will bring a certain amount of business but, being in the centre of the city, we're also expecting business travellers and tourists,\" the Whitbread spokesman said.",

      "body": "<p>Boys have become the weaker sex in education. Finally something is being done about it.\" No, not our boys - this is a headline from the Sydney Morning Herald in April 1994. In Australia, boy trouble has been on the political agenda rather longer than it has here and an Australian government report - the culmination of years of research into the educational performance of girls and boys - was published there last week. </p> <p>Its recommendations do not include all-boy classes or more male teachers, two of the approaches David Blunkett has suggested. Professor Jane Kenway, joint author of the report, explains: \"Sticking blokes in front of the class? I don't think so. Which blokes, modelling what kind of behaviour? There is no evidence to sustain these ideas. We searched the literature for anything relevant to this debate. We had access to everything. If such evidence existed, we would have got it.\" </p> <p>Indeed, in earlier research Kenway found that macho male teachers can exacerbate the problem of \"laddish\" behaviour that commonly goes alongside under-achievement, particularly in all-boy classes. Maritin Mac An Ghaill, researching schools in this country, endorses this. He found that boys who were academically successful were often seen as effeminate by macho teachers as well as pupils - hardly what we would be looking for in challenging the \"lad\" culture. </p> <p>As for all-male classes, Kenway found that \"students and teacher can enjoy being sexist and uncouth with impunity. Single sex provides new opportunities for old-style masculinity, for male bravado and bonding... in terms of gender reform, such classes are bad news.\" </p> <p>Experiments in single-sex classes have already gone ahead in some schools in the wake of the last wave of ministerial enthusiasm. Amanda Barton, from Manchester University, has studied some of them. She found no clear-cut evidence, for or against, but warned that \"though some single-sex classes worked well, in some cases they were disastrous. The worst cases were in large mixed-ability classes where there was absolute chaos. It worked best when pupils were set by ability in small classes and where schools are able to pair teachers and classes very carefully. If the teachers aren't comfortable with it, it is doomed.\" </p> <p>And there, of course, is the rub. Good schools are good because they have good teachers who have high expectations of their pupils and enthusiastic heads who involve staff in creating change, so that they feel motivated rather than imposed upon. If a move to single-sex classes was imposed from above, particularly on reluctant staff and students, it would be counter-productive. </p> <p>The Australian research avoids such simplistic responses. It is primarily concerned with two issues. The first is to recognise which children are failing and target them. The second is to \"develop programmes that encourage boys and girls to move towards positive and flexible gender identities and peer cultures\". Or, as Kenway herself puts it: \"What is required is a curriculum designed to encourage boys to understand different ways of being male. There is an absolute necessity for challenges to the peer culture of boys.\" </p> <p>Ann Phoenix, a professor at the Open University, has just completed a study of boys' attitudes to work. She agrees with Kenway. \"You can't intervene without involving young people. They are not passive, you can't just do things to them. You have to understand the place of laddish culture in boys' lives, work with them, take them seriously.\" </p> <p>Getting young people to take control of changing their own lives is a much slower business than sending out government decrees, but it works at a deeper level. The change in girls' academic success did not occur because the government ordered a move to single-sex schooling (even though it was often advocated). Certainly there were curriculum changes, but the real change occurred when girls began to internalise the idea that it was okay to be female and to be independent. For girls to be able to reject the cultural notion that clever girls couldn't be sexy was a huge step. Surely it must be possible for boys to make a similar cultural leap? </p> <p>A number of small-scale programmes aimed at challenging the \"lads don't work\" attitude are already being implemented in our schools. What they have found is that getting boys to talk about their behaviour is not as hard as it might appear. The first step is to find a strategy that avoids getting too personal - at least to start with. It often helps to begin by surveying the opinion of the children themselves. They usually know just what the problem is and, under cover of something as neutral as an anonymous survey, will be happy to say so. </p> <p>I devised a programme for a school in London that involved surveying year 9 for the reasons why they thought boys were not doing as well as girls. More than half the boys agreed with the statement; \"boys who try hard get laughed at\" and over 90% agreed that they would do as well as the girls if they tried as hard. Armed with an analysis of their opinions, we were then able to break the classes up into single-sex groups and get them to talk about why boys in general (we avoided personalising as much as possible) behaved that way and what they could do to make changes. The experience was noisy and challenging but ultimately illuminating for all. For the first time these boys were talking in public about the ways in which they policed each others' behaviour - collectively depressing achievement. And how they could use the things they are good at (team work in particular) to help each other do better. </p> <p>Tony Sewell at Leeds University organised a similar programme aimed at under-achieving black children (mainly boys). He also started by asking them why they were not performing well. Nine out of 10 saw the major barrier as \"peer group pressure\". They couldn't reconcile the need to do well at school with the need to be accepted by a culture which insists that only nerdy white people work hard. This was the only part of the research that got reported in the press, but it is what happened next that matters. Taking their own estimation of the reasons for their under-achievement as a starting point, Sewell devised a 10-week programme that was then implemented by teachers. </p> <p>It aimed specifically at challenging anti-school attitudes and included sessions on conflict management, social skills, peer group pressures and a critical look at the way in which consumer culture has made use of the \"hard\" image of black youth to sell products such as trainers. He was asking these children to question the way in which the image of black masculinity, which they look up to, could be undermining them. Their progress was measured against a control group in which there was no intervention. The improvement of those taking the programme was striking and is now to be implemented in mixed-race groups in a number of other schools. </p> <p>Alongside such \"consciousness raising\", activities that encourage maturity in boys can be very effective. One of the things most of those working with boys have commented on is the way in which boys' playing about, even in secondary schools, disrupts their own work and that of the class. Unfortunately, infantile behaviour tends to elicit parental-type behaviour in response and boys get locked into a cycle in which they are never asked to behave in a responsible way because they never demonstrate that they can be responsible. </p> <p>Carol Fitz-Gibbon of Durham University set out to intervene in this cycle, with a technique she calls cross-age tutoring. In this, 14-year-olds in danger of dropping out were asked to teach nine-year-olds about, say, fractions. The evidence showed that both age groups benefited. Colin Noble, co-author of Getting it Right for Boys and Girls (Routledge 2000) is enthusiastic about this approach. \"We expect immature behaviour from boys and they behave immaturely. We need to give boys more responsibility - it has fantastic results in terms of behaviour and academic results.\" </p> <p>Whatever action is taken to improve boys' performance, we must remember that boys hear the news, too. According to Ann Phoenix, they deeply resent the way in which the media constructs them as failures. We should beware of a rather unsettling finding from the Australian research: the region with the biggest gap between girls' and boys' attainment is New South Wales, which is also where there has been the most heated debate about boys' achievements. According to the report, \"New South Wales male students are starting to believe the popular press rhetoric about their own lesser competence.\" </p> <p>Are we in danger of fatally undermining boys' confidence by the way we talk about them?</p> <p>\u0095 The Australian report, Factors Influencing the Educational Performance of Males and Females in School and their Initial Destinations after School, by Cherry Collins, Jane Kenway and Julie McLeod of Deakins University, Australia is available at <a href=\"http://www.detya.gov.au/schools/publications/index.htm\">www.detya.gov.au/schools/publications/index.htm</a></p>",

The study by the Scottish Council Foundation, an independent think tank, said lack of experimentation with the curriculum and a stifling of creativity in the classroom has created an education system that is in danger of becoming irrelevant to society. \"While it is true that schools have undergone some changes over the years, they would still be the most familiar institutions to a Victorian time-traveller,\" said SCF director Graham Leicester. \"They are built, managed and run like factories, right down to the clocking-in clock and the factory whistle, and use a mass production model in which one size is supposed to fit all and in practice fits nobody perfectly.\" Mr Leicester said the current exam results crisis and recent rows over teachers pay and conditions are symptoms of a much deeper problem and should be viewed as early warning signs of a catastrophe. \"The traditional skills and behaviours that the school system encourages - both in the content of the curriculum and in the way it is delivered - are in many cases the opposite of those that will be required for survival, prosperity or fulfilment in the future,\" he said. The report, which was drawn up after discussions with teachers, parents, local authority officials and politicians, comes as the current exams crisis continues to grow. The country's largest teaching union, the Educational Institute of Scotland, yesterday branded the affair a disaster and said it was the result of the authorities not listening to warnings from schools about the introduction of a comprehensive new exam system. \"Failures in the past by government and curricular bodies to ensure such involvement have been directly responsible for many of the difficulties which have now become so starkly apparent,\" said an EIS official.

      "body": "<p>Two days into the towering inferno that blanked out Moscow television screens and deprived 10m Muscovites of their daily soap opera fix, the pinnacle of Europe's tallest structure was wobbling last night - a cruel symbol of how Russia's once soaring ambitions are tumbling into hubris and humiliation.</p> <p>The Ostankino television tower, rising 540 metres (1,771ft) to dominate the capital's skyline, was until Sunday a monument to Russian power, prestige and hi-tech can-do, just as - until two weeks ago - the Kursk nuclear submarine was seen as a measure of Russia's military prowess.</p> <p>Gutted by fire and in danger of collapsing into a mangled heap of steel, cable and ferro-concrete, the TV tower yesterday made yet another eloquent mockery of President Vladimir Putin's pledges to make Russia great again.</p> <p>In contrast to his aloof, delayed reaction to the Kursk disaster, however, Mr Putin was quick yesterday to label the TV tower blaze a metaphor for the state of the nation.</p> <p>\"This emergency highlights the condition of our vital facilities as well as of the entire nation,\" he declared. \"Only economic development will enable us to prevent such calamities in the future.\"</p> <p>Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, said at first there was no risk of the tower collapsing, before changing tack and warning of \"a large danger\". The wobbling spire of the secular cathedral was not a problem, argued Anvar Shamuzafarov, chief of the national construction committee, as 300 firefighters finally extinguished the blaze last night. \"All deviations are within the norm,\" he said.</p> <p><b> Tilting</b><br></p> <p>But a Moscow city surveyor said the tip of the tower was tilting 6ft off centre. The main fear was that the 149 steel cables holding up the slender 33-year-old concrete structure could buckle and send at least parts of it crashing.</p> <p>\"The cables are weakened, but not broken,\" said Vyacheslav Mulishkin, deputy head of the Russian fire department.</p> <p>There are few prouder symbols in Moscow of once-hailed Soviet supremacy than the Ostankino tower. Erected in 1967 at the height of the arms and space race with the US and to mark the Russian revolution's birthday, the north Moscow monument, with its revolving Seventh Heaven restaurant commanding panoramic views of the city, instantly overtook New York's Empire State Building as the world's tallest structure.</p> <p>That was then. Ten years of post-Soviet meltdown, retreat from empire, mass impoverishment and colossal corruption have turned Russia into a vast accident waiting to happen.</p> <p>The heyday of the Soviet space effort has given way to a crisis where the Mir space station is on its last legs, forever being patched up, and open to commercial offers from abroad. Latest estimates suggest it needs hundreds of millions of dollars to prevent it falling from its orbit and crashing to earth.</p> <p>August is habitually Russia's cruellest month and this year illustrates the rule - a bomb in the heart of Moscow, the sinking of the Kursk, the towering inferno. Last August brought more bombs in the city and the start of the Chechen war. The previous August brought the financial crash. And so on.</p> <p>But while the submarine sinking convulses Russia with grief and hijacks the world's emotions, and the dramatic pictures of the tower fire dominate the global TV screen, the sad fact of contemporary Russia is that disaster has become a drab and daily fixture. Yesterday alone, in addition to the Ostankino blaze, there were two booby-trap bombs in Grozny, the Chechen capital, a methane gas explosion at a mine in the Urals, and the bodies of two young conscripts were found north of Moscow. They had just shot themselves after going awol from their units.</p> <p>For the professional catastrophists employed by the government's ministry of emergencies come the predictions that endemic bungling, combined with lack of money, will lead to radiation and toxic alerts in the years ahead, as well as air crashes, pipeline ruptures and building collapses.</p> <p>Last week the Izvestiya newspaper reported that more than 1,000 servicemen die every year in peacetime accidents. The military prosecutor's office puts the toll from training mishaps, exploding ordnance and vehicle crashes at 1,100, though activist mothers campaigning for better conditions for their conscript sons put the figure at triple that. \"Natural wastage,\" the Russian military calls it.</p> <p>The daily litany of misfortune generates alarmist, populist politics playing on paranoia, conspiracy theories and fear.</p> <p>In the wake of the Kursk disaster, a \"red-brown\" group of nationalist and communist politicians, writers and editors issued a manifesto for \"national salvation\" to combat Russia's \"spiritual paralysis and despair. In these days of mourning, we are very clearly aware of the scale of the trouble into which Russia has been plunged,\" they proclaimed. \"Our people have been waging a great war for a decade, losing one million of our population every year, and leaving burning cities, blown-up apartment buildings, crashed airplanes, sunken ships, and devastated, depopulated regions, as well as countless graves of our compatriots behind on the battlefield.\"</p> <p>Russia was at \"war for the right to call itself Russia, to control the territory between three oceans, to speak its native language, to worship its holy things, and to honour its heroes and forebears... trying with its last strength to put ships out to sea and squadrons in the air, to pump oil and natural gas, to heat the houses, educate the children, nurse the orphans, and to keep faith in its sovereignty and inviolability, and in the inevitable Russian Victory\".</p> <p>Rather than victory, the current mood is one of demoralised defeatism. Even in the holiday season dozens of people are committing suicide; picking and eating poison mushrooms or bingeing on vodka and then drowning themselves in Moscow's rivers and lakes.</p> <p>President Putin's appeal to Russians is that he represents to them the best option for fashioning order from this chaos, stability from mayhem.

      "bodyText": "Two days into the towering inferno that blanked out Moscow television screens and deprived 10m Muscovites of their daily soap opera fix, the pinnacle of Europe's tallest structure was wobbling last night - a cruel symbol of how Russia's once soaring ambitions are tumbling into hubris and humiliation. The Ostankino television tower, rising 540 metres (1,771ft) to dominate the capital's skyline, was until Sunday a monument to Russian power, prestige and hi-tech can-do, just as - until two weeks ago - the Kursk nuclear submarine was seen as a measure of Russia's military prowess. Gutted by fire and in danger of collapsing into a mangled heap of steel, cable and ferro-concrete, the TV tower yesterday made yet another eloquent mockery of President Vladimir Putin's pledges to make Russia great again. In contrast to his aloof, delayed reaction to the Kursk disaster, however, Mr Putin was quick yesterday to label the TV tower blaze a metaphor for the state of the nation. \"This emergency highlights the condition of our vital facilities as well as of the entire nation,\" he declared. \"Only economic development will enable us to prevent such calamities in the future.\" Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, said at first there was no risk of the tower collapsing, before changing tack and warning of \"a large danger\". The wobbling spire of the secular cathedral was not a problem, argued Anvar Shamuzafarov, chief of the national construction committee, as 300 firefighters finally extinguished the blaze last night. \"All deviations are within the norm,\" he said. Tilting But a Moscow city surveyor said the tip of the tower was tilting 6ft off centre. The main fear was that the 149 steel cables holding up the slender 33-year-old concrete structure could buckle and send at least parts of it crashing. \"The cables are weakened, but not broken,\" said Vyacheslav Mulishkin, deputy head of the Russian fire department. There are few prouder symbols in Moscow of once-hailed Soviet supremacy than the Ostankino tower. Erected in 1967 at the height of the arms and space race with the US and to mark the Russian revolution's birthday, the north Moscow monument, with its revolving Seventh Heaven restaurant commanding panoramic views of the city, instantly overtook New York's Empire State Building as the world's tallest structure. That was then. Ten years of post-Soviet meltdown, retreat from empire, mass impoverishment and colossal corruption have turned Russia into a vast accident waiting to happen. The heyday of the Soviet space effort has given way to a crisis where the Mir space station is on its last legs, forever being patched up, and open to commercial offers from abroad. Latest estimates suggest it needs hundreds of millions of dollars to prevent it falling from its orbit and crashing to earth. August is habitually Russia's cruellest month and this year illustrates the rule - a bomb in the heart of Moscow, the sinking of the Kursk, the towering inferno. Last August brought more bombs in the city and the start of the Chechen war. The previous August brought the financial crash. And so on. But while the submarine sinking convulses Russia with grief and hijacks the world's emotions, and the dramatic pictures of the tower fire dominate the global TV screen, the sad fact of contemporary Russia is that disaster has become a drab and daily fixture. Yesterday alone, in addition to the Ostankino blaze, there were two booby-trap bombs in Grozny, the Chechen capital, a methane gas explosion at a mine in the Urals, and the bodies of two young conscripts were found north of Moscow. They had just shot themselves after going awol from their units. For the professional catastrophists employed by the government's ministry of emergencies come the predictions that endemic bungling, combined with lack of money, will lead to radiation and toxic alerts in the years ahead, as well as air crashes, pipeline ruptures and building collapses. Last week the Izvestiya newspaper reported that more than 1,000 servicemen die every year in peacetime accidents. The military prosecutor's office puts the toll from training mishaps, exploding ordnance and vehicle crashes at 1,100, though activist mothers campaigning for better conditions for their conscript sons put the figure at triple that. \"Natural wastage,\" the Russian military calls it. The daily litany of misfortune generates alarmist, populist politics playing on paranoia, conspiracy theories and fear. In the wake of the Kursk disaster, a \"red-brown\" group of nationalist and communist politicians, writers and editors issued a manifesto for \"national salvation\" to combat Russia's \"spiritual paralysis and despair. In these days of mourning, we are very clearly aware of the scale of the trouble into which Russia has been plunged,\" they proclaimed. \"Our people have been waging a great war for a decade, losing one million of our population every year, and leaving burning cities, blown-up apartment buildings, crashed airplanes, sunken ships, and devastated, depopulated regions, as well as countless graves of our compatriots behind on the battlefield.\" Russia was at \"war for the right to call itself Russia, to control the territory between three oceans, to speak its native language, to worship its holy things, and to honour its heroes and forebears... trying with its last strength to put ships out to sea and squadrons in the air, to pump oil and natural gas, to heat the houses, educate the children, nurse the orphans, and to keep faith in its sovereignty and inviolability, and in the inevitable Russian Victory\". Rather than victory, the current mood is one of demoralised defeatism. Even in the holiday season dozens of people are committing suicide; picking and eating poison mushrooms or bingeing on vodka and then drowning themselves in Moscow's rivers and lakes. President Putin's appeal to Russians is that he represents to them the best option for fashioning order from this chaos, stability from mayhem. But while he promises a restoration of greatness, he also told the grieving relatives of the Kursk crewmen last week that Russia had to learn to live within its means. And while the 118 were entombed in the submarine at the bottom of the Barents sea, the president debated Russia's brain-drain with prominent scientists and told them that only one in 20 businesses in the country were using modern equipment. Trapped And if navy manpower and equipment were not up to mounting an effective rescue for the 118 seamen on the Kursk, so the 300 firefighters in northern Moscow yesterday were struggling to reach at least two people trapped in a lift about 1,000ft up the tower. As many as four people may have died in the gutted structure. All the evidence yesterday suggested that the conflagration had been sparked by negligence and refusals to heed warnings. The fire department said that even when first built, the tower had failed to satisfy the safety regulations. An inspection in May resulted in it being denied the required safety paperwork since its power supply system was 30% overloaded, making the kind of short circuit that occurred on Sunday afternoon virtually inevitable.",

      "bodyText": "The Tories yesterday kicked off their autumn political offensive by unveiling plans to save \u00a3350m by streamlining the incapacity benefits system. David Willetts, the shadow social security secretary, said a new body would be created to pay benefits and provide special medical care. The single fundholder, he said, could save \u00a3350m a year by helping disabled people find work quickly and stop claiming benefits. Mr Willetts said the present system, in which incapacity benefits were paid by the social security department while the NHS looked after health care, acted as a barrier to finding work. \"Under our proposals the new fundholder would be able to purchase physiotherapy, physical aids and medical treatment directly on behalf of disabled people [who] are losing because government programmes for them are rigidly [split] between departments.\" Mr Willetts said that the experience of the private sector showed that the number of people on incapacity benefit could be cut by 5% - a saving of \u00a3350m - under his proposals. Alistair Darling, the social security secretary, last night dismissed Mr Willetts's announcement. He said: \"The Tories are playing catch up. We have already announced proposals to help people back into work, including rehabilitation of people on incapacity benefit. This shows just how desperate the Tories are to find the \u00a316bn of public service cuts they have guaranteed.\"",

It is an easy bit of descriptive shorthand, but it makes Blackwood appear to be puffing after Smith's Porsche on a rickety bike, as is often the lot of British versions of American superstars. </p> <p>Nor is he Britain's Chris Rock, as he has been labeled by more switched-on viewers who detect something of Rock's trendy political incorrectness in the 28-year-old Blackwood's streetwise approach. \"My act used to be much rawer,\" he says. \"I've said things like, 'Yardies aren't organised crime, they're just black people with guns. When did you ever see a black person who's organised?'\" Rock's humour is much more divisive, however, with its gags about the black middle class versus \"niggers\", which isn't where Blackwood is at, at all.

His stand-up routine mines a seam any youngish Briton will recognise - clubs, music and what to do when a gun-toting eight-year-old demands your wallet (\"Two days later I woke up in hospital ...\"), laced with a few F-words to reassure the rap generation. He also dresses rap for good measure: today he bounces into the Langham Hilton in London wearing a baseball cap, huge jeans and a jacket with \"New York\" across the front. </p> <p>He is smooth, assured and witty, but he has had to tone down his act because \"you can't be too black or you scare the mainstream - they think you have a chip on your shoulder.

You have to pull them in softly.\" </p> <p>That speaks volumes about his ambitions, and why he is likely to be the only black British comic of his generation to realise them. Others, such as Curtis Walker and Geoff Schumann, are edgier, but Blackwood knows that the kind of success he craves depends on reaching a white audience. \"There's only two million black people in this country, which isn't enough for me to do strictly black comedy,\" he argues, Streatham vowels tumbling over each other. \"You can say anything you like onstage in America; you can say 'honky' or talk about enslavement and get a laugh, but not here.

Early on, encouraged by his Jamaican parents (\"They told me not to segregate myself - if you're a comedian, you can't limit yourself\"), Blackwood grasped that he could either be \"raw\" and limit himself to fringe venues such as the Hackney Empire, where he started out as a stand-up in 1994, or give people what they want to hear, with a frosting of street culture, and become famous. It wasn't a hard decision. </p> <p>So far, the pay-off has been the Richard Blackwood Show (which came about after a successful stint as an MTV presenter) and a recent single called Mama - Who Da Man?, which made the top three. A single? Yes, his hunger for world domination has led Blackwood to launch a recording career and further fruits of it will be unveiled next week with the single 1234 - Get With the Wicked. It will be followed later in September by an album, You'll Love to Hate This. </p> <p>The defensive title acknowledges that people will be suspicious of a comedian making records, as they have every right to be, given precedents such as Mel Smith and Benny Hill. But Blackwood isn't completely cynical about music. He is a big fan of hip-hop and reggae and has tried, with the help of guests such as the ragga artist General Levy, to make an album that he himself would want to listen to. He has the advantage of coming from a musical family: and uncle, Junior Giscombe, had a worldwide hit in 1982 with Mama Used to Say, which Blackwood sampled on his first single. </p> <p> The result is, well, competent, but too heavily based on the over-worked conceit of presenting Blackwood as an omnipotent sex hunk, with female voices swooning \"We love you, RB!\" Eastwest Records A&amp;R director Cheryl Robson, who signed Blackwood for an astonishing \u00a31m if the rumours are true, calls it \"a party vibe\", which is probably code for \"We know he's not a musician, but cut him some slack\". Still, Will Smith's early records, back when he was the Fresh Prince, were hardly inspiring.

He hasn't drunk alcohol since he was a teenager, and has never tried cigarettes or drugs. \"But do I wanna make a career of it? No. It's a platform, and one I'm embracing, definitely. But I'm a comedian and I'm here to do comedy.\" </p> <p>And to pursue his dream all the way to Hollywood, his ultimate goal. His determination has been boosted by having two role models in the family: Junior, and Naomi Campbell, who became his step-sister when his father married her mother.

      "bodyText": "William Hague suffered a blow to his credibility last night when a prestigious American trade body challenged his claim that Britain would win substantial benefits by forming a new trading bloc with the United States. The Washington-based International Trade Commission said that British membership of the North American Free Trade Area (nafta) would have \"minimal effects\" on the economy. It also warned that such a move could jeopardise British membership of the EU and undermine worldwide trade agreements brokered through Brussels. Mr Hague stepped up his campaign against the EU earlier this year by throwing his weight behind a campaign by anti-Europeans for Britain to join nafta, the trading bloc which links the US, Canada and Mexico. One senior foreign office official condemned the plan as a threat to British membership of the EU. Mr Hague's aides insisted that his proposal to join Nafta was not eurosceptic because he insisted that a Tory government would apply to join the body while retaining British membership of the EU. His twin track European-Atlantic strategy would massively increase trade, aides claimed. However, the International Trade Commission (ITC) reported in Washington last night that dual membership of the EU and Nafta would have a minimal impact on the British economy. The report, which was commissioned by the powerful US senate finance committee, said that Britain's GDP would increase by one tenth of 1% if it joined Nafta, while remaining a member of the EU. The report added: \"Because trade between the UK and the North American countries is subject to relatively low tariffs it was found that elimination of these tariffs would have minimal effects on the economies of the countries in question.\" The foreign secretary Robin Cook, who has warned that Tory support for Nafta is code for withdrawal from Europe, insists that Britain would have to leave the EU to join the American trade body. The Washington-based ITC said in its report last night Britain's GDP would only fall by 0.01% if it abandoned the EU to join Nafta. However, the ITC warned that leaving the EU could severely damage Britain's relations with its European partners who account for more than half of British trade. \"The commercial uncertainty resulting from any alteration in [Britain's relations with the EU] might result in currency volatility and investment flight,\" the report said. \"Were the UK to have a different relationship with the EU, the UK might not only face uncertainty in its trade and investment with the rest of the EU, but might also face uncertainty in its trade relationships with the rest of the world...

      "body": "<p>The British army insisted yesterday that it is not negotiating for the release of 11 of its soldiers snatched by the West Side Boys renegade militia in Sierra Leone. It is merely talking.</p> <p>The army says it has received no demands from the young renegades, but people claiming to speak for the West Side boys have contacted local radio stations to say that they want food, medicine and the release of one of their leaders, known as Brigadier Bomb Blast, from prison before the British soldiers are freed.</p> <p>The first two demands are easily met on humanitarian grounds, but any demand to free Bomb Blast would be almost impossible to meet without compromising the very heart of what the British intervention in the African country is said to stand for.</p> <p>British forces were landed in May as the rebel Revolutionary United Front seized 500 United Nations peacekeepers, launched attacks towards Freetown and appeared to be about to seize power.</p> <p>The UK dispatched 1,000 troops, who secured the capital and airport, confronted the RUF in at least one battle that left close to 20 rebels dead, and assisted in capturing the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh. The British also laid out a military and political strategy to deal with the RUF which, over the following weeks, forced the rebels to retreat.</p> <p>Beyond the immediate moral demand of saving Freetown from more RUF atrocities, Britain said that it was helping to re-establish the rule of law and end the impunity with which soldiers, rebels and some politicians had murdered, raped and looted Sierra Leone close to destruction.</p> <p>Mr Sankoh was not summarily executed, as many Sierra Leoneans would have liked. Instead he will face an international war crimes tribunal that Britain has been instrumental in bringing about. That is why it would be almost impossible to accede to the West Side Boys' demand for the release of Bomb Blast, who was arrested a couple of months ago after a gun battle with an RUF rival on Freetown's streets.</p> <p>The British commander in Freetown, Brigadier Gordon Hughes, has already conceded that the apparent ease with which the renegades were able to capture his soldiers will be a blow to public confidence in his forces. Until now they have been viewed as something close to invincible.</p> <p>Surrendering to the West Side Boys' demands would also undercut confidence in British integrity, which has held up well among Sierra Leoneans, despite a widespread belief that London wound down its military intervention too soon.</p> <p>Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, insisted from the start that the bulk of British forces would pull out by mid-June.</p> <p>By the time mid-June came, the Sierra Leone army had been beefed up, UN forces had been persuaded to fight and a military strategy to confront the rebels was in place.</p> <p>But there was a belief within the British force and among Sierra Leoneans that Mr Cook's timetable was driven more by political considerations than the reality.</p> <p>The rebels may have been on the retreat but victory was far from certain. Today, even a few miles from Freetown, security is still far from guaranteed. The road on which the soldiers were captured is a major route connecting the capital to the international airport and to cities in the north and east. That it should still remain so unstable several months after the RUF was driven from Freetown's gates, is viewed with foreboding locally.</p> <p>The UN launched Operation Thunderbolt last month to clear the West Side Boys' roadblocks but that did not stop the renegades from continuing to ambush cars. They are not alone. The bizarre Kamajor militia continues to extort, rape and even kill at roadblocks on major highways to Bo and other southern cities.</p> <p>For all the problems highlighted by the capture of the soldiers, the British army insists real political and military progress continues to be made against the rebels. But the crucial test will come at the end of the rainy season in December when the struggle for the diamond fields begins.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The British army insisted yesterday that it is not negotiating for the release of 11 of its soldiers snatched by the West Side Boys renegade militia in Sierra Leone. It is merely talking. The army says it has received no demands from the young renegades, but people claiming to speak for the West Side boys have contacted local radio stations to say that they want food, medicine and the release of one of their leaders, known as Brigadier Bomb Blast, from prison before the British soldiers are freed. The first two demands are easily met on humanitarian grounds, but any demand to free Bomb Blast would be almost impossible to meet without compromising the very heart of what the British intervention in the African country is said to stand for. British forces were landed in May as the rebel Revolutionary United Front seized 500 United Nations peacekeepers, launched attacks towards Freetown and appeared to be about to seize power. The UK dispatched 1,000 troops, who secured the capital and airport, confronted the RUF in at least one battle that left close to 20 rebels dead, and assisted in capturing the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh. The British also laid out a military and political strategy to deal with the RUF which, over the following weeks, forced the rebels to retreat. Beyond the immediate moral demand of saving Freetown from more RUF atrocities, Britain said that it was helping to re-establish the rule of law and end the impunity with which soldiers, rebels and some politicians had murdered, raped and looted Sierra Leone close to destruction. Mr Sankoh was not summarily executed, as many Sierra Leoneans would have liked. Instead he will face an international war crimes tribunal that Britain has been instrumental in bringing about. That is why it would be almost impossible to accede to the West Side Boys' demand for the release of Bomb Blast, who was arrested a couple of months ago after a gun battle with an RUF rival on Freetown's streets. The British commander in Freetown, Brigadier Gordon Hughes, has already conceded that the apparent ease with which the renegades were able to capture his soldiers will be a blow to public confidence in his forces. Until now they have been viewed as something close to invincible. Surrendering to the West Side Boys' demands would also undercut confidence in British integrity, which has held up well among Sierra Leoneans, despite a widespread belief that London wound down its military intervention too soon. Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, insisted from the start that the bulk of British forces would pull out by mid-June. By the time mid-June came, the Sierra Leone army had been beefed up, UN forces had been persuaded to fight and a military strategy to confront the rebels was in place. But there was a belief within the British force and among Sierra Leoneans that Mr Cook's timetable was driven more by political considerations than the reality. The rebels may have been on the retreat but victory was far from certain. Today, even a few miles from Freetown, security is still far from guaranteed. The road on which the soldiers were captured is a major route connecting the capital to the international airport and to cities in the north and east. That it should still remain so unstable several months after the RUF was driven from Freetown's gates, is viewed with foreboding locally. The UN launched Operation Thunderbolt last month to clear the West Side Boys' roadblocks but that did not stop the renegades from continuing to ambush cars. They are not alone. The bizarre Kamajor militia continues to extort, rape and even kill at roadblocks on major highways to Bo and other southern cities. For all the problems highlighted by the capture of the soldiers, the British army insists real political and military progress continues to be made against the rebels. But the crucial test will come at the end of the rainy season in December when the struggle for the diamond fields begins.",

      "body": "<p>Ah, computers - you can't live without them and you can't break them open with a chain saw and throw them out of your window, while screaming, \"Logical, my arse - you bloody things make less sense than my granny after her fifth Vimto and stout.\" Well, you can, but the neighbours complain. </p> <p>I am not a happy e-camper. I have just suffered a month of computer-induced lunacy which would not bear comparison with a life-threatening illness, but certainly did leave me with the strong desire to threaten a number of lives. </p> <p>First the historical background - 10 years ago, I worked as a writer-in-residence for a social work department and was given charge of a large Amstrad and its manual. With a lot of trial and error, we came to know each other rather well and I even gave very basic computing tutorials, now and then. Meanwhile, at home I had a baby Amstrad with a defective paper hopper which meant that printing out a novel involved crouching beside the thrashing daisy wheel for a day, wearing industrial ear defenders and feeding in paper by hand until my wrists went numb. But this was character-forming and only happened every year or so. </p> <p>Then planned obsolescence meant that I was sucked into the modern world of ludicrously large memories, ludicrously large programs and laptops. Even so, hell crept in surreptitiously and my first episode of computing dementia only appeared after a number of carefree years when my trusty laptop lapsed into a kind of lunatic haze. I won't bore you with the symptoms, suffice it to say that it seemed to have a memory problem. I mentioned as much to the 10-year-old an emergency repair company sent out. One hour and (if I remember) \u00a3115 later, said 10-year-old pattered through to confirm that my problem did indeed seem to be one of the memory variety. </p> <p> Meanwhile, an entire novel was quite possibly ineffectively saved on a variety of increasingly paranoid disks, while it apparently fluctuated in size for no reason and threatened to disappear entirely. Later a friend who happened by, without fee, dug about a bit and discovered that the machine had decided to fill its hard disk with pointless chains of information, to mark them irremovable and then sit there with the computing capacity of a small goldfish. Why did it do that? I have no idea. Nor did the other repairman I tried who directed his answers to each of my inquiries to the man standing next to me - men know about these things, you see. </p> <p>What all computer owners know and all computer manufacturers ensure, is that after five years pretty much anything to with information technology will do its best to self-destruct. And so it was that my most recent laptop started heading for its happy hunting grounds. It forgot how to type (and I only ever really used it as a grotesquely expensive typewriter), it rejected new software, it made odd noises and, when all else failed, intermittently played dead. This yanked me back immediately into the land of help lines.

      "bodyText": "Ah, computers - you can't live without them and you can't break them open with a chain saw and throw them out of your window, while screaming, \"Logical, my arse - you bloody things make less sense than my granny after her fifth Vimto and stout.\" Well, you can, but the neighbours complain. I am not a happy e-camper. I have just suffered a month of computer-induced lunacy which would not bear comparison with a life-threatening illness, but certainly did leave me with the strong desire to threaten a number of lives. First the historical background - 10 years ago, I worked as a writer-in-residence for a social work department and was given charge of a large Amstrad and its manual. With a lot of trial and error, we came to know each other rather well and I even gave very basic computing tutorials, now and then. Meanwhile, at home I had a baby Amstrad with a defective paper hopper which meant that printing out a novel involved crouching beside the thrashing daisy wheel for a day, wearing industrial ear defenders and feeding in paper by hand until my wrists went numb. But this was character-forming and only happened every year or so. Then planned obsolescence meant that I was sucked into the modern world of ludicrously large memories, ludicrously large programs and laptops. Even so, hell crept in surreptitiously and my first episode of computing dementia only appeared after a number of carefree years when my trusty laptop lapsed into a kind of lunatic haze. I won't bore you with the symptoms, suffice it to say that it seemed to have a memory problem. I mentioned as much to the 10-year-old an emergency repair company sent out. One hour and (if I remember) \u00a3115 later, said 10-year-old pattered through to confirm that my problem did indeed seem to be one of the memory variety. Meanwhile, an entire novel was quite possibly ineffectively saved on a variety of increasingly paranoid disks, while it apparently fluctuated in size for no reason and threatened to disappear entirely. Later a friend who happened by, without fee, dug about a bit and discovered that the machine had decided to fill its hard disk with pointless chains of information, to mark them irremovable and then sit there with the computing capacity of a small goldfish. Why did it do that? I have no idea. Nor did the other repairman I tried who directed his answers to each of my inquiries to the man standing next to me - men know about these things, you see. What all computer owners know and all computer manufacturers ensure, is that after five years pretty much anything to with information technology will do its best to self-destruct. And so it was that my most recent laptop started heading for its happy hunting grounds. It forgot how to type (and I only ever really used it as a grotesquely expensive typewriter), it rejected new software, it made odd noises and, when all else failed, intermittently played dead. This yanked me back immediately into the land of help lines. The two words help and line have, in this case, been fitted together by someone with a truly Satanic understanding of irony. Help lines don't. But they do come in a myriad of increasingly ghastly manifestations. They are discontinued numbers; they are numbers charged at \u00a31 per minute and staffed by inveterate chatterboxes with limited attention spans; they are more moderately priced numbers staffed by individuals who have never met a computer, but know how to turn one off and on again; they are labyrinthine holding patterns of muzak and \"Please continue waiting, your call is important to us\"; they are exorbitant replacements for free information websites; they are based in foreign countries and haunted by alarming pronunciation mutations; they demand your credit card details before an engineer will even cough in your direction; they are, in short, not helpful. But if you should weaken and buy another, newer, cuddlier computer which happens to arrive in less than working order, then you have the joys of arranging the emergency removal of your invalid between a delivery coordinator in France, a delivery service in Britain and a subcontractor in his van with a mobile. You have the pleasure of awaiting repairs which - depending on which person you speak to - are finished, almost finished and encountering mysterious and long-term delays. And then you have the unparalleled delight of receiving an even more dysfunctional device which the vendor is set on refusing to replace.

      "bodyText": "More than a million people partied along to the carnival spirit yesterday as Britain staged two of Europe's biggest Afro-Caribbean festivals. In London, heavy rain failed to dampen the enthusiasm of almost a million revellers at Europe's largest festival, the 36th Notting Hill carnival. And in Leeds more than 75,000 people celebrated a similar event. Despite a downpour at midday just as the colourful parade of floats, flamboyantly dressed dancers and Caribbean steel bands was about to start, the streets of west London were packed with spectators. The event, which featured more than 75 costume bands and two live stages, has its roots in a 1964 street procession aimed at bringing together an Afro-Caribbean community blighted by racism and prejudice. Police said that there had been 145 reported crimes mainly theft, pick-pocketing, assault, drugs offences and drunkenness resulting in 69 arrests, including one for possession of firearms. There had also been two stabbings one of which resulted in a man being taken to St Mary's hospital, in Paddington, west London. Inspector Rod Charles said: \"I'm disappointed by any crime that takes place in the carnival but we had half a million people here yesterday and I think it went very well.\" An enormous purple scorpion costume was among the more spectacular creations worn by carnival dancers. Sheryl Henry who has painted children's faces at the carnival for the last seven years was busy painting 10-year-old Dimitri James in dark mauve war paint. She said: \"Carnival may be more commercial but that's not necessarily a bad thing. There is much less violence and it has become more of a family-orientated event. As long as it doesn't lose its spirit carnival should be a place for everybody. \"The loud sound systems are what the younger kids come for today. It is their way of celebrating carnival.\" The streets along the route were dotted with 42 speaker rigs which attracted hundreds on every street corner. Gavin, whose 25,000 watt system was one of the smaller rigs, said: \"We have had hundreds of people squeezed around our speakers dancing for hours. People come to hear new music which they can't get in commercial night clubs. Meanwhile in Leeds, more than 75,000 people thronged the streets for a three-hour procession and open-air reggae festival. Groups from the Chapeltown and Harehills areas, where the carnival was born 33 years ago, a year after the first event in Notting Hill, swopped saris for Afro-Caribbean costume and vice versa. The switch was designed to symbolise unity in the local community, which has seen tensions in the past between Asian and Afro-Caribbean groups over drugs and street violence. White and Asian residents have played an increasing part in recent years in the carnival, which has become a leading tourist fixture. The Leeds parade was trouble-free in mixed weather, with the long procession led by 16-year-old Sarai Campbell, who beat 15 rival finalists to be crowned carnival queen. Her winning costume on the theme of Caribbean Paradise was tailor-made to fit her exactly, from hundreds of swatches of material, sequins and tinsel.",

      "body": "<p>Ken Campbell's conversation is as curlicued as those unmistakable eyebrows. We're supposed to be talking about ventriloquism, the subject of his latest one-man show at the National Theatre. So why is he telling me about storytelling pets? \"This dog was owned by a Nottinghamshire miner - its name was Dustbin. It told us a story about ghosts, and a story about rabbits ...\" </p> <p>Ventriloquism is the theme of Ken Campbell's History of Comedy: Part One. \"I don't know how many parts there will be,\" says Campbell. \"But Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire was written like that.\" History of Comedy was commissioned - well, agreed to - by Campbell's old sparring partner and current National boss Trevor Nunn. Having famously hoaxed the media and theatre worlds that the Royal Shakespeare Company, after Nunn's hit 70s production of Nicholas Nickleby, was to ditch Shakespeare in favour of Charles Dickens, did Campbell ever think he would one day work for Nunn at the heart of British theatre? \"It's wonderful, isn't it?\" he winks. </p> <p>The brains behind the Ken Campbell Roadshow, formed in 1971, has come a long way. Campbell, Bob Hoskins, Sylvester McCoy and some ferrets touted that manic variety spectacle around the kinds of venue - pubs, working men's clubs - that the arts had deserted. Campbell later founded the Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool, the major offering of which was Illuminatus!, an 11-hour epic that opened the National's Cottesloe space back in 1978, and introduced set designer Bill Drummond to the text that would later inspire his band, the KLF. </p> <p>Since being visited onstage at the Nottingham Playhouse by an angel who warned him \"I'd been taken off the list of those who are called to the Drama\", Campbell has concentrated on autobiographical one-man shows. In 1993, he colonised the Cottesloe with his Bald Trilogy - Furtive Nudist, Pigspurt and Jamais Vu - named to counter the David Hare trilogy unfolding in the theatre next door. The way Campbell tells it, however, the past 30 years were but a digression from his first and real love: ventriloquism. A teenage enthusiast, Campbell's passion for voice-throwing was rekindled last summer, when he attended a ventriloquists' conference in Kentucky. </p> <p>\"You've got to bear in mind that we're a culture that decided not to have ventriloquism. But in the US they carried on with it. It's a scandal over there if you're a father or an uncle and you can't do a bit of ventriloquising.\" Some 60% of American ventriloquists, reckons Campbell, use the skill for educational rather than entertainment purposes - in schools, say, or even churches. \"It has been shown that a lot of folk get the message sharper from a ventriloquist's doll than they do from some berk talking to them.\" </p> <p>Such revelations amounted to a conversion for Campbell, who returned to Britain determined to proselytise for this domestically dormant art - and to resume its practice himself. He launches into a potted masterclass halfway through this interview: \"A friend of mine made up a phrase which contains all the difficulties in the ventriloquist's book: 'Who dared to put wet fruitbat turd in our dead mummy's bed? Was that you, Verity?' \" For five minutes, Campbell contorts his features and further strangulates his buzzsaw Essex vowels in an effort to demonstrate how \"h\" can become \"wh\", \"ng\" become \"m\", and the magic of Keith Harris be forever demystified. But of course, as he concludes, \"a lot of ventriloquists simply grow beards and keep away from the most difficult six letters as best they can\". </p> <p>Campbell's interest, though, derives at least as much from ventriloquism's dummy-free origins as from its modern practice. The word comes from the Latin \"venter\", meaning stomach, and \"loqui\", meaning to speak - those who practised speech from the stomach tended, in 16th-century England, to be burnt at the stake as agents of Satan. The first named ventriloquist, however, was a pygmy called Bizou, court jester to an Egyptian pharaoh some 4,500 years ago. Today's pygmy cultures, says Campbell delightedly, still practice much of Bizou's art, hence his contention that \"you can't really write about the history of comedy without having lived with the pygmies\" - which he intends, in the near future, to do. </p> <p>His favourite phase in the development of ventriloquism went under the name of gastromancy. \"You'd call in a gastromancer,\" he explains, \"if you moved house in ancient Egypt. There would obviously be spirits and demons left lurking there by the people who lived there previously. Now, gastromancers walked with sticky-out arses,\" he continues, suddenly waddling around with a protuberant backside. \"What they do is they hoover the spirit that's in your house up their bottoms - oops! - then you can listen and talk to it in the gastromancer's stomach.\" It's a far cry from ventriloquism as entertainment, I venture. \"I should think,\" counters Campbell, \"it was very entertaining indeed.\" </p> <p> His love for the art is transparent, which may be why he's irate that Britain has written it off as naff. \"There was this thinking that things like farce and music hall would be all right, and that what needed financial backing were the things that you wouldn't do simply because they were fun. So now it's all gone. The scouts don't do gang shows any more. Huge amounts of money get given to worthy projects. But nobody comes to me and says, 'Wow, that's a fantastic idea, which will give a lot of people a lot of pleasure, here's half a million.' \" </p> <p>This perception, that popular forms of theatre were at some point hived off from what was considered respectable art, has animated Campbell's career. \"Foolishly,\" he says, \"when nobody was looking, some things have gone. There's a lot of baby gone out with the bath water.\" In light of his continuing ardour on this point, does he miss the days when he took bustling, chaotic, popular performance to the people? Six years ago he told one paper: \"I think the solo work might be coming to an end.\" It hasn't yet - although he is to join the cast (angels permitting) of the West End hit Art, alongside old pal and In Sickness and in Health co-star Warren Mitchell. Does the great iconoclast worry that, having performed one-man shows at the National Theatre for more than a decade, he's becoming venerable, \"an institution\"? The verbal torrent subsides. He shifts uncomfortably. </p> <p>Campbell, who holds forth incessantly on obscure subjects, is extremely ill-at-ease when asked about perhaps the most obscure of all: himself. \"I don't particularly miss anything,\" he says, eventually. \"If I miss it, I can nostalge on it, relive it in my shows.\" Then, after a pause, \"Nah, I'm not bothered. I just get on with my bit. I leave those kind of worries to people like you.\" </p> <p>He's not the first clown to seek to avoid being seen to take things seriously. Whether it's by design or by instinct, who knows, but a zany prattle rises from Campbell's stomach whenever conversation threatens to reveal the hidden Ken. That compulsion to digress, of course, is related to the indefatigable fund of ideas with which Campbell has long brightened British theatre - so we should be thankful for it. \"That was the only department where I had any value,\" he says, in a reflective moment, \"looking at what exists to see what is missing, to see what people had forgotten about. It's been worrying me for 30 years, since I heard about it, that people don't pad their arses any more ...\" And with that he's off again, the gadfly gastromancer, ventriloquist and dummy rolled into one. </p> <p>Ken Campbell's History of Comedy - Part One: Ventriloquism is in rep at the National Theatre, London SE1 (020-7452 3000), till September 9.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Dictators and torturers across the world may be sleeping a little less soundly these days. Not because of a sudden attack of conscience, but because Labour - through its recently published draft legislation - is helping to tip the international balance away from impunity and toward justice.</p> <p>Our draft bill will put Britain's full weight behind the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) which will be a giant step forward for human rights and the rule of international law. For the first time there will be an international body to try individuals responsible for the worst crimes known to humankind. Future Pol Pots and Pinochets should be warned: merchants of oppression, atrocity and genocide, however powerful or feared in their own country, can be brought to justice. And through scrupulously fair trials which can place the blame on individuals rather than communities, the ICC will promote peace and reconciliation.</p> <p>Based in The Hague, the ICC will build on the model and jurisprudence established to try Nazis in Nuremberg and the current war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. But uniquely, the ICC will have a forward-looking and potentially global mandate.</p> <p>The ICC will deal with three clearly defined offences: genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It will have jurisdiction over crimes committed after its establishment - not over past atrocities. The main responsibility for punishing crimes will remain that of nation states. The ICC will only intervene if the countries concerned have proved unable or unwilling genuinely to investigate the crimes themselves. This might happen where conflict has led to the collapse of the local judicial system or where a dictatorial government refuses to punish its own abusers.</p> <p>Except when the UN Security Council refers situations to the court, the ICC will only have jurisdiction over crimes committed in countries which have ratified the court's statute, or by their nationals. It will look to states to provide evidence, arrest suspects and enforce the sentences it passes down.</p> <p>Like any body which emerges from many years of extensive negotiation involving the international community, the ICC will be neither a magic wand nor an all-powerful Big Brother. But because it is the product of international agreement, rather than unilateral initiative, the ICC's decisions will represent the will, and demand the respect, of the whole world.</p> <p>Under Labour, Britain has already proved itself one of the court's strongest supporters. We proved it by our pivotal role at the successful Rome conference that adopted the ICC Treaty. We proved it by helping to give the court the power to punish not only those who massacre civilians but also those who commit sexual violence or use child soldiers. And we continue to prove it by doing our best to mobilise international support for the court, including by lobbying reluctant countries such as the US.</p> <p>The legislation will enable Britain to provide maximum assistance to the ICC. For example, it will allow the law-enforcement authorities to identify, arrest and, through a streamlined process, surrender war crimes suspects to The Hague. It will allow us to gather evidence, freeze assets and enforce court sentences.</p> <p>And it will empower our courts to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed here or by UK nationals overseas. This means that we will always be able to fulfil our responsibility to prosecute such crimes.</p> <p>Our ambition is to be one of the court's founding members. The bill will enable Britain to ratify the Rome statute of the ICC and so push up the number of ratifications towards the 60 countries needed for the statute to come into force and for the ICC to begin its work.</p> <p>We are publishing the bill in draft for comments by October 12 because we want to maximise agreement before its parliamentary introduction, especially among those with particular interests or expertise. There is widespread, cross-party support for the ICC. The more civil society and government can cooperate over the details in the bill implementing the treaty, the greater the chance of making quick parliamentary progress.</p> <p>That will also depend upon cooperation between government and opposition parties. I have written to them and to a wide range of parliamentarians asking for their comments on the draft. We are genuinely open to suggested changes which improve the bill without destroying it.

      "bodyText": "Dictators and torturers across the world may be sleeping a little less soundly these days. Not because of a sudden attack of conscience, but because Labour - through its recently published draft legislation - is helping to tip the international balance away from impunity and toward justice. Our draft bill will put Britain's full weight behind the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) which will be a giant step forward for human rights and the rule of international law. For the first time there will be an international body to try individuals responsible for the worst crimes known to humankind. Future Pol Pots and Pinochets should be warned: merchants of oppression, atrocity and genocide, however powerful or feared in their own country, can be brought to justice. And through scrupulously fair trials which can place the blame on individuals rather than communities, the ICC will promote peace and reconciliation. Based in The Hague, the ICC will build on the model and jurisprudence established to try Nazis in Nuremberg and the current war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. But uniquely, the ICC will have a forward-looking and potentially global mandate. The ICC will deal with three clearly defined offences: genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It will have jurisdiction over crimes committed after its establishment - not over past atrocities. The main responsibility for punishing crimes will remain that of nation states. The ICC will only intervene if the countries concerned have proved unable or unwilling genuinely to investigate the crimes themselves. This might happen where conflict has led to the collapse of the local judicial system or where a dictatorial government refuses to punish its own abusers. Except when the UN Security Council refers situations to the court, the ICC will only have jurisdiction over crimes committed in countries which have ratified the court's statute, or by their nationals. It will look to states to provide evidence, arrest suspects and enforce the sentences it passes down. Like any body which emerges from many years of extensive negotiation involving the international community, the ICC will be neither a magic wand nor an all-powerful Big Brother. But because it is the product of international agreement, rather than unilateral initiative, the ICC's decisions will represent the will, and demand the respect, of the whole world. Under Labour, Britain has already proved itself one of the court's strongest supporters. We proved it by our pivotal role at the successful Rome conference that adopted the ICC Treaty. We proved it by helping to give the court the power to punish not only those who massacre civilians but also those who commit sexual violence or use child soldiers. And we continue to prove it by doing our best to mobilise international support for the court, including by lobbying reluctant countries such as the US. The legislation will enable Britain to provide maximum assistance to the ICC. For example, it will allow the law-enforcement authorities to identify, arrest and, through a streamlined process, surrender war crimes suspects to The Hague. It will allow us to gather evidence, freeze assets and enforce court sentences. And it will empower our courts to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed here or by UK nationals overseas. This means that we will always be able to fulfil our responsibility to prosecute such crimes. Our ambition is to be one of the court's founding members. The bill will enable Britain to ratify the Rome statute of the ICC and so push up the number of ratifications towards the 60 countries needed for the statute to come into force and for the ICC to begin its work. We are publishing the bill in draft for comments by October 12 because we want to maximise agreement before its parliamentary introduction, especially among those with particular interests or expertise. There is widespread, cross-party support for the ICC. The more civil society and government can cooperate over the details in the bill implementing the treaty, the greater the chance of making quick parliamentary progress. That will also depend upon cooperation between government and opposition parties. I have written to them and to a wide range of parliamentarians asking for their comments on the draft. We are genuinely open to suggested changes which improve the bill without destroying it. My objective is to have a bill which is in the best possible shape and enjoys maximum cross-party consensus ready for introduction as soon as parliamentary time allows. But it is important that the bill does not get caught in the middle of the kind of parliamentary filibustering or obstruction of other contentious legislation in which opposition parties have always indulged. A commitment by all the parties to the smooth passage of this bill would be a clear message to the world's tyrants that the British people are united in wanting international justice.

In Spain, the city of Madrid has had an ombudsman since 1996 with wide powers including the clout to investigate individual cases and the ability to issue warnings (for instance, on inaccurate images of the young in the media). Issues tackled include immigrant and marginilised children; children's free time and the development of children's councils in the city. (Perhaps one way of encouraging adult participation later in the democratic process?) So how do we measure up in England?</p> <p>Labour is, of course, committed to building a human rights culture and modernising government. It has invested hugely in childcare and alleviating child poverty. It even promised a commissioner and a minister for children in its 1992 manifesto. All of which makes its bout of midsummer madness on the establishment of an English commissioner all the more inexplicable.</p> <p>Under the new Care Standards Act, England will have, instead, a children's rights director. He or she will be concerned only with the 200,000 children living away from home, for instance, in residential care and boarding schools. The other 11m young people under the age of 18 will remain without an equivalent representative voice. The government also tried to foist a director with slightly wider powers on the Welsh Assembly but to its credit, it is having none of it. Instead, the assembly is pushing for a commissioner with a role closer to that defined by its health and social services committee earlier this year.</p> <p>The Welsh commissioner, as defined by the committee, would promote the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (which includes political, and economic goals); require impact statements to assess the affect of policies on the young; conduct an annual audit on the state of Wales's children; encourage research; monitor government actions; raise the profile of the young and act as champion, watchdog and whistleblower. A commissioner would also have the power to inquire into breaches of children's rights and demand action. \"At the heart of our need for a commissioner,\" the committee concluded, \"Is the need for all of us to listen to all children and young people; to have a genuine commitment to reflecting their views.\"</p> <p>It sounds like common sense - so why has the government backed off in England? Does an ombudsman require too much administrative upheaval? Or can it be fear of a certain section of the population who view children's rights as a euphemism for infant anarchy and adults wronged? Those who believe that \"rights\" basically boils down to smacking - and that's nobody's grown-up business but their own?</p> <p>Moira Rayner, a New Zealand lawyer with international experience in children's rights, now has three years to challenge such head-in-the- sand ideas - and to add to the pressure on government to appoint an English commissioner with strong statutory powers. Rayner is director of the newly created Office of the Children's Rights Commissioner for London.</p> <p>One of the least publicised promises made in the mayoral election was to appoint \"a children's champion\" in the assembly. Livingstone has yet to fill the post. Nevertheless, Rayner's work (guided by a panel of young people and partly funded by the lottery) is already underway. She is preparing a report on the state of London's children and (with Livingstone's officers) drawing up a strategy. \"If London can get it right for children,\" runs her argument. \"Any major city can.\"</p> <p>\"Children's rights are often confused with civil rights - for instance, the right to freedom of association,\" Rayner says. \"What they're actually about is social rights - the right to a decent quality of life. And the right for a child's views to be treated seriously when important decisions are made about the society in which we all live. They don't cancel out adult responsibility but they do encourage fair play and cooperation.\"</p> <p>London has 1.74m young people under 18. Twice the national proportion live in workless households. But Rayner is keen that the government's obligations aren't restricted to minimising risk and tackling poverty, important though those goals are. What also matter, she argues, are positive measures to stimulate the well-being of the young, for instance, in transport, the environment and health. (The NSPCC too has long argued for well-being indicators to establish a coordinated national measure of child development.)</p> <p>In July, with little fanfare, the government established a children's unit to coordinate efforts. Instead of being anchored in the Cabinet Office alongside the women's unit and the social exclusion unit, as organisations such as the NSPCC had hoped, the children's unit has been sited in the Department of Education and Employment, backed by a cross-governmental committee chaired by Paul Boateng, at the Home Office.</p> <p>The government has also said it will monitor the progress of the Welsh Children's Commissioner before taking a decision on an English equivalent - although the worldwide evidence already exists. A clear strong voice is missing. As Sir William Utting, former Chief Inspector of Social Services, says, \"Governments are dominated by the pushes and pulls of an electorate in which only grown-ups have votes, and issues about children are, as a result, continuously overshadowed... Children need a strong independent office to represent their interests comprehensively and to ensure that public and private agencies deliver what law and public policy require.\"</p> <p>That is understood and accepted in Scotland, Ireland and Wales - why not in England too?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"> comment@theguardian.com </a></p>",

The other 11m young people under the age of 18 will remain without an equivalent representative voice. The government also tried to foist a director with slightly wider powers on the Welsh Assembly but to its credit, it is having none of it. Instead, the assembly is pushing for a commissioner with a role closer to that defined by its health and social services committee earlier this year. The Welsh commissioner, as defined by the committee, would promote the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (which includes political, and economic goals); require impact statements to assess the affect of policies on the young; conduct an annual audit on the state of Wales's children; encourage research; monitor government actions; raise the profile of the young and act as champion, watchdog and whistleblower. A commissioner would also have the power to inquire into breaches of children's rights and demand action. \"At the heart of our need for a commissioner,\" the committee concluded, \"Is the need for all of us to listen to all children and young people; to have a genuine commitment to reflecting their views.\" It sounds like common sense - so why has the government backed off in England? Does an ombudsman require too much administrative upheaval? Or can it be fear of a certain section of the population who view children's rights as a euphemism for infant anarchy and adults wronged? Those who believe that \"rights\" basically boils down to smacking - and that's nobody's grown-up business but their own? Moira Rayner, a New Zealand lawyer with international experience in children's rights, now has three years to challenge such head-in-the- sand ideas - and to add to the pressure on government to appoint an English commissioner with strong statutory powers. Rayner is director of the newly created Office of the Children's Rights Commissioner for London. One of the least publicised promises made in the mayoral election was to appoint \"a children's champion\" in the assembly. Livingstone has yet to fill the post. Nevertheless, Rayner's work (guided by a panel of young people and partly funded by the lottery) is already underway. She is preparing a report on the state of London's children and (with Livingstone's officers) drawing up a strategy. \"If London can get it right for children,\" runs her argument. \"Any major city can.\" \"Children's rights are often confused with civil rights - for instance, the right to freedom of association,\" Rayner says. \"What they're actually about is social rights - the right to a decent quality of life. And the right for a child's views to be treated seriously when important decisions are made about the society in which we all live. They don't cancel out adult responsibility but they do encourage fair play and cooperation.\" London has 1.74m young people under 18. Twice the national proportion live in workless households. But Rayner is keen that the government's obligations aren't restricted to minimising risk and tackling poverty, important though those goals are. What also matter, she argues, are positive measures to stimulate the well-being of the young, for instance, in transport, the environment and health. (The NSPCC too has long argued for well-being indicators to establish a coordinated national measure of child development.) In July, with little fanfare, the government established a children's unit to coordinate efforts. Instead of being anchored in the Cabinet Office alongside the women's unit and the social exclusion unit, as organisations such as the NSPCC had hoped, the children's unit has been sited in the Department of Education and Employment, backed by a cross-governmental committee chaired by Paul Boateng, at the Home Office. The government has also said it will monitor the progress of the Welsh Children's Commissioner before taking a decision on an English equivalent - although the worldwide evidence already exists. A clear strong voice is missing. As Sir William Utting, former Chief Inspector of Social Services, says, \"Governments are dominated by the pushes and pulls of an electorate in which only grown-ups have votes, and issues about children are, as a result, continuously overshadowed... Children need a strong independent office to represent their interests comprehensively and to ensure that public and private agencies deliver what law and public policy require.\" That is understood and accepted in Scotland, Ireland and Wales - why not in England too? comment@theguardian.com",

As we saw during the hurried departure of the di Marco family from Albert Square, there's nothing like a fictitious relative when you need to get characters off the screen, fast. Peggy has \"Aunt Sal\" and Frank his daughter \"Claire\" for the same reasons. We soap viewers tolerate these tricks - we believe in our Peggys and Franks, but we also understand that they are actors. They get sick, they go on holiday, and sometimes, they get sacked. </p> <p>The di Marcos' departure had its dodgy elements. A hitherto unheard-of uncle needs help in his restaurant, so the whole family ups sticks. Including Teresa - who'd always fought for independence from her family? Rosa, who presumably owned the house she'd transformed into something resembling an Imperial Palace, is suddenly prepared to leg it with a couple of suitcases? There was plenty that didn't ring true. But few viewers minded. There was, if anything, more sympathy for the programme-makers, trying valiantly to dispose of this singularly unpopular family while retaining an element of drama. </p> <p>There's a story about two Italian-Americans, having an argument. One shouts at the other, \"If you had a restaurant, I wouldn't eat at it!\" From the modest outcry that followed the di Marcos' banishment, it would seem that this is how most viewers felt about them. But why? </p> <p>They were not unconvincing characters. Setting aside the grandparents (whose \"foreign\" mannerisms would have gone down great in any production of Fiddler On The Roof), the di Marco family was played by skilled professionals. Mark Bannerman was superb as an arrogant lecher, who lacked the brains or the courage to leave the shelter of Mama's apron. In her early days, seducing married men and corrupting innocents, Leila Birch's Teresa was redolent of the poisonous Lucy Ewing in Dallas. </p> <p>The least convincing di Marco is the one who's staying - Beppe. He seemed far too gentle to have been a vice cop, and it's still hard to list any adjectives that describe his character. Try asking someone in the street. Ten to one they'll say something like, \"Handsome. Erm. Small beard.\" </p> <p>Looking at Beppe's flaws highlights the problem that dogged the whole family. They had an ambiguity, heightened by the job they did. Soapland has no place for grey areas. Bad things happen to bad people. They also happen to good people, of course, but not for very long. To make this predictable universe work on the screen, you need characters who are relatively stable (even if they are unstable). The writers and the viewers buy into a myth that people aren't particularly complex, that the full range of their feelings and actions can be revealed in a few hours on the TV. And a quick, visible way of revealing characters is to mirror them in their occupation. Thus we have Pauline Fowler, long-suffering drudge and matriarch. What better job than folding pants all day in the launderette? Or Peggy Butcher - tough but fun-loving and gregarious. So she runs the pub. But what attributes spring to mind when we think of Italian restaurants? Fond of pasta, perhaps? Permanently overworked? The job never provided an easy route into understanding the di Marcos' characters. </p> <p>Another way soaps let us inside their characters is by showing them in interaction with others. It's easy to see what Janine is like because she's installed in the caf\u00e9, dealing shrewishly with a stream of customers in every episode. The same goes for the market traders and everyone who ever pulled pints in the Vic. The most visible jobs tend to be taken by the strongest, most vivid characters. </p> <p>Confined to their restaurant, the di Marcos could only become involved in Walford life when other characters came over to eat a carbonara. And how often do working-class East End people do that? If any di Marco wanted a night out, a pint in the Vic, a clandestine liaison, then an excuse had to be found as to why they weren't working. Transforming Giuseppe's into a daytime sandwich bar, and sending Teresa onto the market were bold rescue attempts, but they came too late. The viewers had already decided they didn't much care. Beppe has been given a family in a bid to render him real. As a vice cop, always away on shadowy missions, and now running the night-club, he's always inhabited a twilight world. Accordingly, his character is vague - if he's to stay, he has to be given an extra dimension. </p> <p>Because of their jobs, the di Marcos became a largely self-contained unit. Rosa had her friendship with Irene. Gianni had his love affair with Steve's sister, Jackie. But these were small Peroni compared to the complex spider-webs surrounding Pauline and Peggy. The di Marco most embedded in the Square was teenage Nicky - with her links to Sonia and Martin, members of big-league families. But - since we are not in Neighbours territory - she could hardly stick around without her family. </p> <p>It's too early to say much about the di Marcos' replacements. With luck, they will be well-drawn, convincingly acted and popular with the audience. But if they try opening a restaurant, it won't be long before they're heading off to their uncle.</p>",

One shouts at the other, \"If you had a restaurant, I wouldn't eat at it!\" From the modest outcry that followed the di Marcos' banishment, it would seem that this is how most viewers felt about them. But why? They were not unconvincing characters. Setting aside the grandparents (whose \"foreign\" mannerisms would have gone down great in any production of Fiddler On The Roof), the di Marco family was played by skilled professionals. Mark Bannerman was superb as an arrogant lecher, who lacked the brains or the courage to leave the shelter of Mama's apron. In her early days, seducing married men and corrupting innocents, Leila Birch's Teresa was redolent of the poisonous Lucy Ewing in Dallas. The least convincing di Marco is the one who's staying - Beppe. He seemed far too gentle to have been a vice cop, and it's still hard to list any adjectives that describe his character. Try asking someone in the street. Ten to one they'll say something like, \"Handsome. Erm. Small beard.\" Looking at Beppe's flaws highlights the problem that dogged the whole family. They had an ambiguity, heightened by the job they did. Soapland has no place for grey areas. Bad things happen to bad people. They also happen to good people, of course, but not for very long. To make this predictable universe work on the screen, you need characters who are relatively stable (even if they are unstable). The writers and the viewers buy into a myth that people aren't particularly complex, that the full range of their feelings and actions can be revealed in a few hours on the TV. And a quick, visible way of revealing characters is to mirror them in their occupation. Thus we have Pauline Fowler, long-suffering drudge and matriarch. What better job than folding pants all day in the launderette? Or Peggy Butcher - tough but fun-loving and gregarious. So she runs the pub. But what attributes spring to mind when we think of Italian restaurants? Fond of pasta, perhaps? Permanently overworked? The job never provided an easy route into understanding the di Marcos' characters. Another way soaps let us inside their characters is by showing them in interaction with others. It's easy to see what Janine is like because she's installed in the caf\u00e9, dealing shrewishly with a stream of customers in every episode. The same goes for the market traders and everyone who ever pulled pints in the Vic. The most visible jobs tend to be taken by the strongest, most vivid characters. Confined to their restaurant, the di Marcos could only become involved in Walford life when other characters came over to eat a carbonara. And how often do working-class East End people do that? If any di Marco wanted a night out, a pint in the Vic, a clandestine liaison, then an excuse had to be found as to why they weren't working. Transforming Giuseppe's into a daytime sandwich bar, and sending Teresa onto the market were bold rescue attempts, but they came too late. The viewers had already decided they didn't much care. Beppe has been given a family in a bid to render him real. As a vice cop, always away on shadowy missions, and now running the night-club, he's always inhabited a twilight world. Accordingly, his character is vague - if he's to stay, he has to be given an extra dimension. Because of their jobs, the di Marcos became a largely self-contained unit. Rosa had her friendship with Irene. Gianni had his love affair with Steve's sister, Jackie. But these were small Peroni compared to the complex spider-webs surrounding Pauline and Peggy. The di Marco most embedded in the Square was teenage Nicky - with her links to Sonia and Martin, members of big-league families. But - since we are not in Neighbours territory - she could hardly stick around without her family. It's too early to say much about the di Marcos' replacements. With luck, they will be well-drawn, convincingly acted and popular with the audience. But if they try opening a restaurant, it won't be long before they're heading off to their uncle.",

      "body": "<p>If you want to see Picasso's 1907 masterpiece Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, pride of the greatest collection of modern art in the world, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, you have to sidle into a strange sin-bin just above the temporary cafe. This is where Picasso's explosive assault on reality has been relegated, like an embarrassing elderly relative, in a rum show called Collection Highlights. </p> <p>Moma, the institution that is synonymous with the very idea of modern art, is going through a convulsive change. Collection Highlights is one product of that change as the museum undergoes a year-long, three-part rehang which culminates in the autumn with Moma's first full survey of contemporary art since 1960. This promises to be the most dramatic new display in its history, one that abandons its infamous linear narrative of modern art in favour of a year-long series of collage-like shows. </p> <p>Founded by wealthy Manhattan art lovers in 1929 when Picasso was at best the butt of cartoonists' \"three-eyed girlfriend\" gags, this museum has championed the modern movements from surrealism to pop, given a home to European artists and artworks in exile - Picasso's Guernica was cared for here throughout the Franco dictatorship - and made modernism distinctively American. Along the way it has acquired the most comprehensive and imposing collection of modern art that is ever likely to be assembled anywhere. </p> <p>Moma founded its reputation on high-handed certainty. It was revered and feared for the way it determined the history of art. It devised the evolutionary story of modern art as a succession of \"isms\". Alfred H Barr, director of the museum in the mid-20th century, saw the history of modern art movements as a linear progress toward the supreme goal of abstraction. A rehang in 1993 maintained this story of modern art in which you walked from Monet's lily pond to C\u00e9zanne's Mont St Victoire to Picasso's brothel. </p> <p>But now the museum has had a breakdown. Not that you can blame it. For 30 years academic critics have been deconstructing modernism. And when they pick apart the history of modern art, they attack modern art's most powerful institution. Moma has even been outed as a front for the CIA in the 50s, when its international touring shows of American art were supposedly little more than Cold War propaganda exercises. </p> <p>The museum has capitulated; it has shoved scores of great paintings into the background to make way for photographs, home movies, outsider art and the cute suburban realist Norman Rockwell. The year-long changing displays collectively entitled Moma 2000 tell a story of pluralism, and the wishy-washy consequences of this are revealed in the names of the sections of the hang: Making Choices, to be followed by Open Ends. </p> <p>The assumption behind Moma's reshuffle, like the Tate's, appears to be that to continue creating, we have to free ourselves from a burdensome history. Picasso has to be put in his place. Less well-known currents of 20th-century art have to be given more weight. But was the grand narrative of modern art ever so oppressive? </p> <p>Moma is a monument to the creative value of bigotry. In the middle of the 20th century it set itself up as guardian of an unarguable truth. It claimed to speak for the high tradition of art in our time and demanded new art live up to it. According to the current curatorial consensus, this ought to have been disastrous. Art in New York in the shadow of Moma ought to have shrivelled. But that is not what happened. </p> <p>In the few rooms at Moma given over to Collection Highlights, you turn a corner and Jackson Pollock's One (No 31, 1950) dances in mid-air, a rapturous, inexhaustible frieze. Pollock painted with Moma's history of modernism before his eyes. He was not intimidated. Art in New York in the 40s, 50s and 60s was more creative than anywhere else in the 20th century except Paris before the first world war. And it was creative because artists had something to sharpen their teeth on. </p> <p>This is the lesson the collection of the Museum of Modern Art really teaches: that a sense of history is essential to the making of art. The lesson is conveyed in the Collection Highlights room that focuses on 50s New York. Across from the Pollock is a painting that could not be more different, yet could not have existed without it. Jasper Johns's Target with Four Faces (1955) is the work of a young artist who wanted to make an impact in a New York dominated by Pollock's followers in the abstract expressionist school - how better than by doing the opposite of Pollock? </p> <p>Where Pollock's painting is rangy, splashy, spontaneous, Johns' Target is uptight and laboriously thought out. Johns used a method of painting - encaustic, an ancient wax-based technique - that enabled him to build up his image in dense, static layers. Instead of flowing like Pollock's expressive drips, it is set like wax. The painting includes four macabre cast faces that heighten the chilly surrealism. Under the paint are collaged newspaper stories; you can make out a title from a book-review page entitled \"History and Biography\". </p> <p>So different, yet the Pollock and the Johns are similar. They both speak of encoded, inarticulate memory; whatever history and biography may lie concealed in Johns' Target, there is the same sense of secret history in Pollock's art. This is a creative, healthy dialogue of artists. The picture of Moma as modernist oppressor is also undermined by the fact that Alfred H Barr, high priest of -isms, bought three of Johns' postmodern paintings for the museum, including Target, from his first solo exhibition at the Castelli gallery in 1958. He also wanted to buy Flag (1954-5), but was afraid the trustees would see it as anti-American, so he got the architect Philip Johnson to buy it and present it to Moma later as a gift. </p> <p>The deficiencies of the new, softer history of modern art are obvious when you go from this room to the version of 50s Manhattan as presented in the new displays. Here we are told that art in 50s New York was wildly divergent in approach. Divergent in quality, too, it appears. Second-rate abstract expressionists, realists, the idiosyncratic Louise Bourgeois and the almost-pop Larry Rivers are hung together in a display that completely fails to capture the excitement of the period. What is missing right through the new-look Moma is a sense of urgency. Some of the displays are better than others, but always you feel infra-academic games are being played and this great collection is not being shown off. </p> <p>A comparison with Tate Modern is hard to avoid. The Tate has done a similar display with far more style, perhaps because it has fewer inhibi tions; the Tate owns about one fifth of the great art Moma does so it can afford to take risks. Conversely, where Moma 2000 does score is in being more extensive than the Tate. A section called Walker Evans and Co, treats the documentary photographer of the 30s as a hidden influence on artists from Robert Rauschenberg to Sherrie Levine and places photography at the heart of American art. It is a major exhibition in itself and juxtaposes such gems as Robert Frank's 50s photographs of the American heartland and Edward Hopper's painting of a sad usherette in a Manhattan movie theatre. A display dedicated to Alfred Jarry and the College of Pataphysics is astonishing, and the museum's stores have been ransacked for treasures such as an Angus Calder model of the Universe and what feels like the entire early work of Louise Bourgeois. But this very scholarly thoroughness - in contrast to Tate Modern's infectious populism - adds to the sense of a slightly jaded exercise by curators whose main aim is to impress their colleagues. As for the rest of us, we can go see the Collection Highlights. </p> <p>The fact is that for most of us, modern art is still provocative. Picasso is still provocative. Pollock is still provocative, and so are the contemporary artists Moma will be showing in depth in September, including Rachel Whiteread, Robert Gober and Charles Ray. The oldest museum of modern art in the world naturally wants to reinvent itself so it will influence the art of the 21st century as decisively as it did the 20th. The museum is already preparing for a massive building project that will almost double its exhibition space. It will close its doors for much of the process, which will be complete in 2004-5. Doubtless when it reopens its current hesitancy will give way to the customary hectoring manner. Meanwhile the home of modern art appears to be London.</p>",

As Sidelines hangs up her diaphanous shift dress and reaches for the sensible slacks, she ponders her most memorable summer moments. The cornfield at dawn? The badger sett at dusk? The Magnum advert? What a relief, then, that as the autumn chill sets in across the country, temperatures will be rising elsewhere. The Ann Summers chain is set to open its first Middle Eastern outlet in Dubai next month, followed by a dozen others across the region, including one in the holy city of Mecca. Palpitations at the arrival of mango-flavoured massage oil are bound to ensue, though whether on the grounds of religion or refinement, it remains to be seen. Any excuse not to end up with a comedy gift of sequined nipple tassles, eh ladies? On the other hand, perhaps that's just what Liz Hurley's after. Despite allegedly describing her sex life with Hugh Grant as \"less than adequate\", Hurley was snapped enjoying a holiday clinch in Sardinia with her recent ex. Isn't it a marvel? While most of us are reaching for the breadknife during the first few months following a break-up, the pair are exhibiting an enviable maturity. Trading childish insults with friends, drinking buckets of gin and listening to Nanci Griffith's Anyone Can Be Somebody's Fool on a loop may seem like a good idea at the time, but it won't get you in the papers.",

      "body": "<p>Yesterday morning, a sixtysomething man approached me outside Superdrug on Clapham High Street. Wide-eyed, unshaven, clean but slightly shabby, he tottered towards me brandishing a scrap of paper. Why? I didn't wait to find out. No sooner had he made eye contact than I muttered a quick \"No!\" and moved snappily out of his path. It was only as I walked away, relaxed, took stock, that I realised I'd almost certainly just rebuffed a tired, slightly confused old man, asking for directions on a busy London street.</p> <p>Sadly, in the past few years I've lost my urban spontaneity and joy. Out there these days, I'm tense, careful and mistrustful. It wasn't always this way. I used to walk about like a puppy in the sunshine, enjoying the air, the buzz of being alive and out in the city. So what's changed? Just the tawdry fact that I can no longer walk alone down these south London streets without being harassed by men.</p> <p>Young men, old men, sober, drunk, clean, filthy, black, white, in cars, vans, lorries or out of them. Almost every day, at any time of day, I am yelled at, leered at, snarled at, lip-smacked at. I have had my bottom pinched, my clothes grabbed - even, on one occasion, my breast squeezed.</p> <p>Some do it menacingly, fixing me with their eyes and muttering graphic, sexually suggestive things. Others - just as oppressive if not so obviously intimidating - verbally assess my hair, clothes, demeanour. \"Hello, love ... Smile, my darling! ... Love the hat!\" If I don't respond, they raise the volume: \"Hey, Blondie, I'm talking to you!\"</p> <p>If challenged (not that I've ever dared), this type would act innocent, swear they meant no harm. But they know exactly what they mean. \"Hello, love, don't imagine you can walk down this street in peace: you're up for grabs, you're mine to fiddle with, this space is not yours but mine to step into as often as I want. You're here for my amusement, sunshine.\"</p> <p>Constant low-level harassment of this sort ensures I finish the 10-minute walk to my workplace feeling angry, hostile, flushed. I resent this. It's not how I want to feel or how I want to live. Why should I start each day in combat mode, adrenaline flowing, just to guard my right to be me?</p> <p>But it's not just the men on the pavement or up ladders. Most sinister of all, perhaps, are the ones in their cars - not lorries but Fords and Astras and Volvos. These are the sneaky cowards who, snug and slimy in their tin boxes and bored attraffic lights, catch your eye and roll theirs, jiggle their eyebrows at you, make thrusting movements with their tongues.</p> <p>These men - and we're talking men in suits, white-collar workers - probably also like to think they are good sorts. They like to have a laugh, go down the pub, watch the game on TV, then go home to wives or girlfriends. If someone made a sexually suggestive comment to their woman, they'd be outraged.

So why me? Why now? Why so much?</p> <p>The answer is, I can't possibly be the only one. Plenty of women living in cities are putting up with this sort of hassle just as I do, day in, day out. Talking to friends, we reckon only two things really stop you getting hassled: driving everywhere or walking around with kids, especially in pushchairs. Motherhood still seems to equal sexual anonymity - though it has to be said that the only time I ever received a serious proposition from a stranger was when I was eight months gone with my third.</p> <p>But my kids are at school all day and I don't want to be forced into a car. Getting a dog seemed a good idea and certainly in winter, with my Border collie in tow, I became less a woman, more a dog walker - someone with a purpose rather than a helpless floozy flaunting her sex.

Now, in August, minus the coat, \"Give us a stroke, darling\" comes the wretched cry from lorries.</p> <p>The boy who grabbed my breast was a jaunty 15 or 16-year-old - well-dressed, good-looking, Walkman on his head, hands hanging loose by his side. It was a sunny May morning when our paths crossed. He made me jump and hurt my breast. By the time I got over the shock and realised I'd been assaulted, he'd disappeared.</p> <p>I called the police who listened sympathetically while admitting there wasn't much they could do.

      "byline": "Christopher Hope",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I live in France and I have one small advantage over other foreigners who live here: I've left not one country behind, but two. Being an expatriate takes practice. Most countries make the migrant feel foreign; France does something entirely different - it seems to encourage the belief that you are at home. </p> <p>I live in the southern Languedoc, in a small village midway between the Black Mountains and the Mediterranean. When I arrived some years back, you hardly ever heard English. My neighbours spoke none - and they still don't. But things are changing. </p> <p>Frederic runs the village restaurant, and for years he has been looking around his pretty restaurant, with its pink tablecloths and black and white tiles, and saying: \"I think I'm the only Frenchman in the room.\" It was never the case. But it is becoming truer by the month. </p> <p>Not just more and more visitors are finding their way here, but visitors who, at least in my part of southern France, are most foreign of all, the native British. Until now we were bypassed when the Brits came south; they were heading down to Spain or Provence. These days they are coming in numbers. </p> <p>In this part of the Midi, they are a novelty still - exotic birds with queer nesting habits. Overexcited, overloaded, and unquestionably over here. Arriving in seasonal migrations, like the hirondelles, to be sighted in chattering flocks, in the squares of Carcassonne or Toulouse. Or beside the Canal du Midi, shirts off, stunned by the sun, the cheapness of the wine, the sheer expanse of it all. </p> <p>Those who settle in these parts may be divided into the high- and the low-flyers. Some head over the Black Mountains into the high country of the Tarn, about an hour's drive from Toulouse, as the Volvo plies. It is shapely, familiar country - Castres and Lautrec and Albi - so green and so wet that some call it \"God's pisspot\". </p> <p> Something comforts the English heart in the Tarn. Narrow your eyes and you might be in Gloucestershire. So many migrants from well-heeled London suburbs have been buying up cottages and farmhouses that they've taken to calling it \"Kensing-tarn\". </p> <p>Rather fewer head south, into the Midi, and the great Mediterranean plain stretching from the Black Mountains to Spain and the sea. This is my patch. It is hot, rough, rocky country - a place of cherry trees, summer vipers, seasonal hippies, mystics, oddballs and vineyards. Each small stone village is an island on the great wine lake. We make a lot of wine, and - if you buy it fresh - what you don't drink inside a week, you may as well wash your hair in. In the old days they used wine to mix mortar, when water was scarce. </p> <p>This is the land of those Manichean heretics called the Cathars, so violently destroyed 700 years ago and now remembered in the menus and the wine lists. Even heresy can be packaged now. Everything begins in mysticism and ends in politics, said Charles Peguy. Not any more, it doesn't. In this part of the Midi, what starts in mysticism ends in tourism. </p> <p>Come to Cathar country, say the publicity people. Come to pastel country, come to the land of Cockaigne. The publicity campaign is a remarkable sleight of hand. Because, in truth, this part of the Languedoc isn't anyone's country - it is beautifully and plainly itself. It is not smart, it is not neat. As for historical treasures, the Cathars have vanished, and pastel is a very small crop. The land of Cockaigne is not what it was - if it ever was. </p> <p>What the place has is history and ghosts and memories of former invaders - Greeks, Romans, Goths, crusaders. Some of them stayed on, just as they do now. The British are just the latest in a long line of exotic imports. And a fine corrective to what one might imagine the locals think about the invasion of the Brits was summed up strikingly by the woman who was asked what she felt about the waves of English migrants and said simply: \"Well, I suppose it's a bit better than the Arabs.\" </p> <p>I put it down to the familiar racism, the kind the Midi is noted for - but then it occurred to me that she might have been thinking of the Moors. After all, they spent a lot of time besieging Carcassonne, centuries ago. And so did the Goths and crusaders, and even the English. Everyone came down when they felt like having a war. </p> <p>So why are the English coming - again? I'd like to think the reasons are faintly religious. There is an old German proverb I rather like that holds that \"God lives in France\". Quite so. I once had a New Zealand neighbour who one night, back in Christchurch, saw my village in a vision, and came and settled here. She didn't come in search of God. As she told me over tea one day, she was God. </p> <p>But the British don't come here for religious reasons. They don't believe that God lives in France. A lot of the time they don't seem to believe in the French, either. They come because, deep down, they believe the Brits do France better than anyone else. Understand it, appreciate it, love it. They believe in France. What a shame then to leave it to the French. </p> <p>It has been the genius of the French to encourage this view. They do it by removing themselves from the scene and letting visitors continue in the splendid delusion. So foreigners come and they stay. We make French wine and keep French bees and recreate French houses, and we do it so well that it seldom strikes us that the Gallic spirit we seem to pick up, the flair we are proud of, exists in our own minds. </p> <p>I made a French garden; it has a vine and a pomegranate tree. My French neighbours came to see it and they knew it at once; they said: \"How very good it is to see an English garden in the Midi.\" </p> <p>Perhaps what is sometimes seen as French arrogance is really a kind of splendid indifference. Because the paradox of life in France is that the more \"French\" you become, the more your national traits are accentuated. You become more, and not less, the way you were at home. </p> <p>And no one minds! That's why most of the visitors bound for Paris or Toulouse or Lyon this summer will find that most of the locals have left town. What seems odd is perfectly logical.

      "bodyText": "I live in France and I have one small advantage over other foreigners who live here: I've left not one country behind, but two. Being an expatriate takes practice. Most countries make the migrant feel foreign; France does something entirely different - it seems to encourage the belief that you are at home. I live in the southern Languedoc, in a small village midway between the Black Mountains and the Mediterranean. When I arrived some years back, you hardly ever heard English. My neighbours spoke none - and they still don't. But things are changing. Frederic runs the village restaurant, and for years he has been looking around his pretty restaurant, with its pink tablecloths and black and white tiles, and saying: \"I think I'm the only Frenchman in the room.\" It was never the case. But it is becoming truer by the month. Not just more and more visitors are finding their way here, but visitors who, at least in my part of southern France, are most foreign of all, the native British. Until now we were bypassed when the Brits came south; they were heading down to Spain or Provence. These days they are coming in numbers. In this part of the Midi, they are a novelty still - exotic birds with queer nesting habits. Overexcited, overloaded, and unquestionably over here. Arriving in seasonal migrations, like the hirondelles, to be sighted in chattering flocks, in the squares of Carcassonne or Toulouse. Or beside the Canal du Midi, shirts off, stunned by the sun, the cheapness of the wine, the sheer expanse of it all. Those who settle in these parts may be divided into the high- and the low-flyers. Some head over the Black Mountains into the high country of the Tarn, about an hour's drive from Toulouse, as the Volvo plies. It is shapely, familiar country - Castres and Lautrec and Albi - so green and so wet that some call it \"God's pisspot\". Something comforts the English heart in the Tarn. Narrow your eyes and you might be in Gloucestershire. So many migrants from well-heeled London suburbs have been buying up cottages and farmhouses that they've taken to calling it \"Kensing-tarn\". Rather fewer head south, into the Midi, and the great Mediterranean plain stretching from the Black Mountains to Spain and the sea. This is my patch. It is hot, rough, rocky country - a place of cherry trees, summer vipers, seasonal hippies, mystics, oddballs and vineyards. Each small stone village is an island on the great wine lake. We make a lot of wine, and - if you buy it fresh - what you don't drink inside a week, you may as well wash your hair in. In the old days they used wine to mix mortar, when water was scarce. This is the land of those Manichean heretics called the Cathars, so violently destroyed 700 years ago and now remembered in the menus and the wine lists. Even heresy can be packaged now. Everything begins in mysticism and ends in politics, said Charles Peguy. Not any more, it doesn't. In this part of the Midi, what starts in mysticism ends in tourism. Come to Cathar country, say the publicity people. Come to pastel country, come to the land of Cockaigne. The publicity campaign is a remarkable sleight of hand. Because, in truth, this part of the Languedoc isn't anyone's country - it is beautifully and plainly itself. It is not smart, it is not neat. As for historical treasures, the Cathars have vanished, and pastel is a very small crop. The land of Cockaigne is not what it was - if it ever was. What the place has is history and ghosts and memories of former invaders - Greeks, Romans, Goths, crusaders. Some of them stayed on, just as they do now. The British are just the latest in a long line of exotic imports. And a fine corrective to what one might imagine the locals think about the invasion of the Brits was summed up strikingly by the woman who was asked what she felt about the waves of English migrants and said simply: \"Well, I suppose it's a bit better than the Arabs.\" I put it down to the familiar racism, the kind the Midi is noted for - but then it occurred to me that she might have been thinking of the Moors. After all, they spent a lot of time besieging Carcassonne, centuries ago. And so did the Goths and crusaders, and even the English. Everyone came down when they felt like having a war. So why are the English coming - again? I'd like to think the reasons are faintly religious. There is an old German proverb I rather like that holds that \"God lives in France\". Quite so. I once had a New Zealand neighbour who one night, back in Christchurch, saw my village in a vision, and came and settled here. She didn't come in search of God. As she told me over tea one day, she was God. But the British don't come here for religious reasons. They don't believe that God lives in France. A lot of the time they don't seem to believe in the French, either. They come because, deep down, they believe the Brits do France better than anyone else. Understand it, appreciate it, love it. They believe in France. What a shame then to leave it to the French. It has been the genius of the French to encourage this view. They do it by removing themselves from the scene and letting visitors continue in the splendid delusion. So foreigners come and they stay. We make French wine and keep French bees and recreate French houses, and we do it so well that it seldom strikes us that the Gallic spirit we seem to pick up, the flair we are proud of, exists in our own minds. I made a French garden; it has a vine and a pomegranate tree. My French neighbours came to see it and they knew it at once; they said: \"How very good it is to see an English garden in the Midi.\" Perhaps what is sometimes seen as French arrogance is really a kind of splendid indifference. Because the paradox of life in France is that the more \"French\" you become, the more your national traits are accentuated. You become more, and not less, the way you were at home. And no one minds! That's why most of the visitors bound for Paris or Toulouse or Lyon this summer will find that most of the locals have left town. What seems odd is perfectly logical. They have absented themselves from the scene. Paris can then be reinvented as the visitors wish, free from the prejudices of those who live there. The south of France performs much the same function for visiting Parisians, who are, in some ways, even more foreign than the English. Smart northern French metropolitans find my village quaint, bucolic, simple. And my village does its best to conform. La Cit\u00e9, the medieval fortress on a hill beside modern Carcassonne, does it to perfection. It is a fairytale castle in a pop-up picture book, all crenellations, turrets, battlements. In summer you may see knights jousting below the massive walls, curio shops hawking plastic pikes and spikes, and a museum of medieval torture beside the little creperie. First we take a close look at flaying, then we tuck into good jam crepes. This leads some to say that La Cit\u00e9 is like Disney World. But then they are the sorts of people who have been only to Disney World. In fact, the better parts of Disney World are faintly like medieval Carcassonne. It is a real place. Real soldiers died on the battlements. The Romans and the Goths attacked it. Officials of the Inquisition sniffed out Cathar heretics and then burned them in real bonfires.

Official statistics suggest at least 7,000 youngsters, some no more than five or six years old, live or work on the streets. Many of them come from families that have migrated to Istanbul from the mainly Kurdish south-east of the country. Most are extremely poor, although that is not the case with Leyla Alkis's family. The family may now face legal action for forcing Leyla to go out to work, although such prosecutions are very rare.",

In a foretaste, Langdon recently named Jonathan Powell, the prime minister's chief of staff, as one of the figures who undermined Ms Mowlam while she was Northern Ireland secretary.</p> <p>Peter Mandelson, Ms Mowlam's successor, will not escape lightly. He is expected to be blamed for highlighting Ms Mowlam's inattention to detail, a suggestion which prompted Mr Mandelson to question her wisdom in co-operating with Langdon.</p> <p>This will not be the only flare-up Tony Blair's firefighters will have to contend with. Columnist Andrew Rawnsley's Servants of the People threatens to offer fresh insights into crucial episodes in the Blair administration.</p> <p>Problems may also flow from Geoffrey Robinson, the treasury minister who resigned with Peter Mandelson over the \u00a3373,00 home loan, but did not come back. He will be giving his side of the story.</p> <p>The millionaire publisher of the New Statesman remains a loyal ally of Gordon Brown and his The Unconventional Minister promises to concentrate on policy-making, not personalities. But it can hardly be gossip-free.</p> <p>Such rumour and calculation make authors, agents and the newspapers to whom they have sold serialisation rights nervous. \"I've got things very tightly tied up with the PR people,\" a terse Paddy Ashdown said from his French retreat this week.</p> <p>It falls to Michael Heseltine to be first on the bookstands when his memoirs, A Life in the Jungle, will be published on September 8 with an ambitious print run of 50,000 copies. Volume one of Paddy Ashdown's Diaries (1983-97) will appear last in November.</p> <p>The reason for his delay is the same as the former Tory deputy prime minister's early appearance. Both have seen how big-name memoirs such as Margaret Thatcher's - and even John Major's unexpected best seller - have upstaged their party's conferences.</p> <p>Just as Mr Heseltine insisted that his book come out well before the Tory conference beginning on October 2, so the former Liberal Democrat leader resisted blandishments to allow his to make waves during Charles Kennedy's week in Bournemouth starting on October 17. It is especially sensitive this year since Mr Kennedy is publishing his own slim volume.</p> <p>Mr Ashdown has also refused to publish anything connected with this parliament so keen Lib Dems will have to wait for volume II after the next general election to learn the authorised version of Tony Blair's aborted plan to bring him into government in 1997.</p> <p>This diary will be up against stiff competition. Ion Trewin, urbane managing director of Weildenfeld and Nicolson, has edited a second volume of the late Alan Clark's best-selling diaries, arguably the wittiest and wickedest political diaries of a diary-strewn century.</p> <p>The Times has bought serialisation rights, though word in the book trade is that they are bound to be judged \"disappointing\" simply because the first volume was such a hit.</p> <p>They may lack the spice provided by what one Clark fan called glimpses of \"the black stocking tops of power\". Volume II covers post-1992 when he was (mostly) no longer an MP and his heroine no longer prime minister. But it will end strongly as the wealthy ex-defence minister sweeps back to Westminster in the 1998 Kensington and Chelsea byelection.</p> <p>Mr Clark was famously not a fan of William Hague and had mixed feelings about Michael Portillo - the two names media-watchers will be looking for as they scan the index.</p> <p>Unexpectedly Michael Heseltine's book (he rejected the titles Tarzan or Hezza) is said to be \"astonishingly kind\" to the rightwing Portillo, briefly his deputy in the struggle to replace the poll tax. He is ruder about Lady Thatcher and Norman Tebbit, but guarded about Mr Hague.</p> <p>Hezza's old Oxford Union chum Anthony Howard, who was \"at his elbow\" during the writing, reveals that he was also reluctant to settle scores with the likes of cabinet rival Kenneth Baker. \"He's not very good at knifing people,\" says Mr Howard, who calls it a proper old-fashioned biography which starts with Mr Heseltine's Swansea childhood.</p> <p>Mr Heseltine admits getting guests to sign the register before the Tube trains shook the foundations of his first hotel in Bayswater, central London- the basis of his fortune. But the author reports no recollection of two famous anecdotes: mixing margarine with butter in the hotel or writing out his plan to become prime minister on the back of an envelope at Oxford.</p> <p>William Hague will have problems of his own. Journalist Jo-Anne Nadler will become first to publish a biography - William Hague: In His Own Right. Although friendly she already appears to be the source of the claim that the Tory leader drank 32 rum and cokes on his 18th birthday, after all that beer at 15.</p> <p>In Anne Widdecome: Right from the Beginning, Nicholas Kochan attempts to trace the shadow home secretary's life from her convent to high office.</p> <p>She and Mr Hague will have time to live down any awkward revelations before they are likely to take office. Ministers are in a trickier situation, especially when an ex-colleague like Peter Kilfoyle, the MP for Liverpool Walton, is writing Left Behind: Lessons from Labour's Heartland.</p> <p>Although it promises to be a portrait of his native Liverpool it will also address his resignation as junior defence minister last winter and how heartland disaffection must be faced.</p> <p>The tireless political biographer Paul Routledge is still busy working on Margaret Thatcher's murdered colleague Airey Neave this winter. He has just returned from Colditz from which Neave escaped in World War II. He will also reissue his biography of the former speaker Betty Boothroyd (\"fully updated\").</p> <p>Donald MacIntyre, his rival in the race to write up Peter Mandelson in 1998, will finally bring out an equally-revised paperback version of his Mandelson after the admired hardback was pulped in a libel suit.</p> <p>Guiding Light, a collection of the late John Smith's words, will be more kindly received, certainly more so than Tom Bower's unauthorised version of Geoffrey Robinson's life which he will complete after his biography of another turbulent tycoon - Branson - comes out.</p> <p>With books the publishers can never tell what will make a sensation and what will sell. Mo Mowlam promises to write her own book eventually. But that has not stopped Little Brown printing 30,000 copies of Langdon's book, nor staff at the printers reading it as they print. \"I've never heard that happening before,\" says its editor. It's the Mo Factor.</p> <p><b>Chapter and verse on the foibles and feuds</b></p> <p><b> A Life in the Jungle</b><br></p> <p><b> by Michael Heseltine</b></p> <p>Co-written with columnist Anthony Howard, the former deputy PM's memoirs will reignite the debate over Tory party splits, with criticism of Thatcher, praise for Portillo and guarded remarks about Hague's leadership.</p> <p>Published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton on September 8.</p> <p><b> Into Politics: The Long-awaited Early Years</b></p> <p><b>by Alan Clark</b></p> <p>Huge sums of money have changed hands in the battle for the serialisation rights to this second instalment of the late Tory minister's extraordinarily successful - and viciously offensive - political diaries.

Such rumour and calculation make authors, agents and the newspapers to whom they have sold serialisation rights nervous. \"I've got things very tightly tied up with the PR people,\" a terse Paddy Ashdown said from his French retreat this week. It falls to Michael Heseltine to be first on the bookstands when his memoirs, A Life in the Jungle, will be published on September 8 with an ambitious print run of 50,000 copies. Volume one of Paddy Ashdown's Diaries (1983-97) will appear last in November. The reason for his delay is the same as the former Tory deputy prime minister's early appearance. Both have seen how big-name memoirs such as Margaret Thatcher's - and even John Major's unexpected best seller - have upstaged their party's conferences. Just as Mr Heseltine insisted that his book come out well before the Tory conference beginning on October 2, so the former Liberal Democrat leader resisted blandishments to allow his to make waves during Charles Kennedy's week in Bournemouth starting on October 17. It is especially sensitive this year since Mr Kennedy is publishing his own slim volume. Mr Ashdown has also refused to publish anything connected with this parliament so keen Lib Dems will have to wait for volume II after the next general election to learn the authorised version of Tony Blair's aborted plan to bring him into government in 1997. This diary will be up against stiff competition. Ion Trewin, urbane managing director of Weildenfeld and Nicolson, has edited a second volume of the late Alan Clark's best-selling diaries, arguably the wittiest and wickedest political diaries of a diary-strewn century. The Times has bought serialisation rights, though word in the book trade is that they are bound to be judged \"disappointing\" simply because the first volume was such a hit. They may lack the spice provided by what one Clark fan called glimpses of \"the black stocking tops of power\". Volume II covers post-1992 when he was (mostly) no longer an MP and his heroine no longer prime minister. But it will end strongly as the wealthy ex-defence minister sweeps back to Westminster in the 1998 Kensington and Chelsea byelection. Mr Clark was famously not a fan of William Hague and had mixed feelings about Michael Portillo - the two names media-watchers will be looking for as they scan the index. Unexpectedly Michael Heseltine's book (he rejected the titles Tarzan or Hezza) is said to be \"astonishingly kind\" to the rightwing Portillo, briefly his deputy in the struggle to replace the poll tax. He is ruder about Lady Thatcher and Norman Tebbit, but guarded about Mr Hague. Hezza's old Oxford Union chum Anthony Howard, who was \"at his elbow\" during the writing, reveals that he was also reluctant to settle scores with the likes of cabinet rival Kenneth Baker. \"He's not very good at knifing people,\" says Mr Howard, who calls it a proper old-fashioned biography which starts with Mr Heseltine's Swansea childhood. Mr Heseltine admits getting guests to sign the register before the Tube trains shook the foundations of his first hotel in Bayswater, central London- the basis of his fortune. But the author reports no recollection of two famous anecdotes: mixing margarine with butter in the hotel or writing out his plan to become prime minister on the back of an envelope at Oxford. William Hague will have problems of his own. Journalist Jo-Anne Nadler will become first to publish a biography - William Hague: In His Own Right. Although friendly she already appears to be the source of the claim that the Tory leader drank 32 rum and cokes on his 18th birthday, after all that beer at 15. In Anne Widdecome: Right from the Beginning, Nicholas Kochan attempts to trace the shadow home secretary's life from her convent to high office. She and Mr Hague will have time to live down any awkward revelations before they are likely to take office. Ministers are in a trickier situation, especially when an ex-colleague like Peter Kilfoyle, the MP for Liverpool Walton, is writing Left Behind: Lessons from Labour's Heartland. Although it promises to be a portrait of his native Liverpool it will also address his resignation as junior defence minister last winter and how heartland disaffection must be faced. The tireless political biographer Paul Routledge is still busy working on Margaret Thatcher's murdered colleague Airey Neave this winter. He has just returned from Colditz from which Neave escaped in World War II. He will also reissue his biography of the former speaker Betty Boothroyd (\"fully updated\"). Donald MacIntyre, his rival in the race to write up Peter Mandelson in 1998, will finally bring out an equally-revised paperback version of his Mandelson after the admired hardback was pulped in a libel suit. Guiding Light, a collection of the late John Smith's words, will be more kindly received, certainly more so than Tom Bower's unauthorised version of Geoffrey Robinson's life which he will complete after his biography of another turbulent tycoon - Branson - comes out. With books the publishers can never tell what will make a sensation and what will sell. Mo Mowlam promises to write her own book eventually. But that has not stopped Little Brown printing 30,000 copies of Langdon's book, nor staff at the printers reading it as they print. \"I've never heard that happening before,\" says its editor. It's the Mo Factor. Chapter and verse on the foibles and feuds A Life in the Jungle by Michael Heseltine Co-written with columnist Anthony Howard, the former deputy PM's memoirs will reignite the debate over Tory party splits, with criticism of Thatcher, praise for Portillo and guarded remarks about Hague's leadership. Published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton on September 8. Into Politics: The Long-awaited Early Years by Alan Clark Huge sums of money have changed hands in the battle for the serialisation rights to this second instalment of the late Tory minister's extraordinarily successful - and viciously offensive - political diaries. Publishing insiders warn they can only be a let-down after the sensational first volume. Embarrassment for grandees but no worries for Hague. Published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson on October 12. Mandelson by Donald Macintyre This paperback edition of the highly acclaimed biography of Peter Mandelson has been updated. The author promises additional material on his downfall and rehabilitation but hottest news may be an update on the Brown-Mandelson feud. Published by HarperCollins on September 18. Servants of the People by Andrew Rawnsley The Observer columnist who revealed the \"psychological flaws\" remark about chancellor Gordon Brown is expected to reveal who offered him this insight - was it or wasn't it Alastair Campbell? Likely to focus on the alleged deal Brown and Blair struck in opposition over the Labour leadership and the deep tensions that has provoked ever since. Published by Hamish Hamilton on September 25 William Hague: In His Own Right by Jo-Anne Nadler Unfortunately for Nadler, a journalist and former Tory party media manager, the best insights into the youthful Hague contained in her unauthorised biography have already been scooped - by the man himself when he told GQ earlier this month that he was once a 14-pints-a-night man. Published by Politico's Publishing on October 2. Ann Widdecombe: Right from the Beginning by Nicholas Kochan This unauthorised biography is expected to contain interesting insights to the shadow home secretary's childhood, her religion and her unstinting moral views on everything from abortion to fox hunting. Published by Politico's Publishing on October 2. Mo Mowlam by Julia Langdon This biography may be unauthorised but the author, the former political editor of The Mirror, has enjoyed close co-operation from the minister's friends - which does not bode well for enemies of the massively popular but deeply embittered Cabinet Office minister. A barrage of political revelations is promised, including the inside story of Dr Mowlam's fall from grace in the New Labour inner circle. Published by Little, Brown &amp; Company on October 12. Left Behind: Lessons from Labour's Heartland by Peter Kilfoyle The respected former defence minister is expected to continue his criticism of Tony Blair and the Labour leadership. Published by Politico's Publishing in October. The Unconventional Minister by Geoffrey Robinson Even the driest of tales from the former paymaster general will refocus attention on the Blair-Brown-Mandelson relationship. The most potentially damaging book this autumn. Published by Michael Joseph on November 2. The Ashdown Diaries, Volume I (1988-97) by Sir Paddy Ashdown These memoirs have already got Downing Street officials in jitters with plans to detail Tony Blair's talks about joining Labour's cabinet in 1997. Published by Allen Lane The Penguin Press on November 2. Julia Hartley-Brewer",

      "body": "<p>There is a crisis in the Leicester museum service this week, of passionate interest to the museum community if not - on the face of it - to many people outside.</p> <p>The city has already closed one museum and lost some of its most senior museum staff. From September 1 its smaller museums will cut opening times by two hours, and the main museum by half an hour. The collection care and exhibitions budgets have been cut by over 50%, funds for education stand at a tiny \u00a38,000.</p> <p>\"It is an absolutely catastrophic situation, and the most depressing thing is that it's not a freak. It's an extreme but typical example of what's happening all over the country,\" says David Barrie, director of the Art Fund, an independent charity to which desperate museums are turning in increasing numbers to plug some of their funding gaps.</p> <p>The crisis in the British regional museum service is exemplified by the dilemma of the director of a once nationally admired museum service, who is trying to find more cuts in a service already slashed to the bone - the budget has been cut by 15 % in real terms since 1997. National figures show a landslip which is threatening to become an avalanche of jobs lost, hours cut, treasures crumbling and, ultimately, museums closing.</p> <p>\"Some museums are going to close,\" says Maurice Davies, deputy director of the Museums Association. \"There is a strong public expectation that when things go into a museum they are going to stay there for ever, on display to the people. That is not going to be true.\"</p> <p>Mr Davies's is one of many voices warning against complacency. Studies show that even those who do not visit museums value them and expect them always to be there. But without considerably more vocal public support for museums to give them political clout in local and national funding debates, the handful of museums which have already closed will be the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p>\"It's not just us, it's all over the country, but that's not much comfort in our situation,\" says Margaret Warhurst, director of the Norton Priory museum in Runcorn, which is struggling to cope with a 20% local authority grant cut. \"It is very hard to see free admission being talked about for the huge national museums in London when our local residents, in an area which is 16th on the national deprivation index, still have to pay to come into our museum. We will survive this year by hook or crook. But we cannot go on like this.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile objects in collections are literally rotting, particularly those items which are stored out of the public view - up to 90% of the collection in many museums.</p> <p>Sharyn Manitta, a freelance conservator and a founder member of the Institute of Conservators, says: \"This is a huge, huge problem, a multi-million pound problem. I have had curators in tears in my studio because they want to do the best they possibly can for their collections, but they have not got the money or the resources, and they have no influence over the financial decisions being taken.</p> <p>\"There are objects - costumes, paintings, furniture, archaeological objects - literally dropping to pieces in museum stores.\" Three quarters of museums now believe their in-house conservation service is inadequate.</p> <p>\"Conservators all over the country are losing their jobs, and it is a completely false economy,\" says Ms Manitta. \"Putting off conservation work means that far more expensive work will have to be done further down the road.\"</p> <p>Mr Barrie is more brutal. \"The expertise of the people who know about these things, and who know how to care for them, is being squandered and thrown aside. It is a national tragedy.\"</p> <p>There are few national figures on the plight of museums, in a field fragmented between national museums directly funded by the government, local authority museums and independent collections. Resource, the body formed by the merger of the museums and galleries commission and the libraries and archives commission, is collecting statistics on the scale of the problem. However the most recent report, published earlier this year, and evidence from Area Museum Councils, from the Museums Association, and from the Art Fund, suggest a national pattern in which thousands of opening hours have been cut and hundreds of staff lost in compulsory or voluntary redundancies.</p> <p>There are estimated to be over 80m visits each year to museums and galleries in the UK, but the report showed a 4% drop in visits in the year 1997-8 (partly explained by competition from new lottery- funded visitor attractions) and a 2.5% drop in the number of full-time staff to 12,590.</p> <p>The situation now is undoubtedly even worse. Those figures were collected just before or just after the 1997 local government reorganisation when the impact had yet to be felt of new unitary authorities taking on a huge range of museum responsibilities, or county wide museum services - as in Leicestershire - being split between town and county councils.</p> <p>Of the Area Museum Councils - which are funded through Resource by the department of culture - contacted by the Guardian, Yorkshire and Humberside, the North West, West and East Midlands, Eastern Region and the South East, all reported budget cuts and staff numbers falling in museums in their area, and a slight but noticeable drop in visitor numbers. The South West, which has dozens of tiny independent museums, is being supported by an army of unpaid volunteers - the award-winning Lyme Regis museum is entirely voluntarily staffed.</p> <p>Outright closures are rare, but in the last year the York Story, a popular heritage centre run by the York Museums Service, and the Wygston's House costume museum in one of the oldest houses in Leicester simply locked their doors. Others, like the ancient Stranger's Hall in Norwich, are no longer permanently staffed but open by appointment only on a couple of days a week. Museums in Ipswich and Exeter have fought off the worst threatened cuts this year but are braced for further assaults.</p> <p>The Museums Association has received recent alarm calls from museums in Luton, Billericay, and Portsmouth, from nationally important museums in Durham and Lancashire, from collections in pros perous Cheshire and in the more deprived Hackney Downs in east London.</p> <p>Most cuts are so gradual - half an hour here, half a day there, a senior curator with a lifetime of experience taking voluntary redundancy to be replaced by somebody younger and cheaper - that the scale of the problem is only gradually becoming apparent. \"It's death by a thousand cuts,\" says David Barrie. \"Taken individually these cuts might not seem disastrous, but they could add up to a national catastrophe.\"</p> <p>In Leicester the council leader, Ross Wilmott, is taking the flak for cuts in a service which he genuinely believes is essential to the vitality of his city. \"But Leicester is one of the worst funded local authorities in the country,\" he says. \"We have lost the equivalent of \u00a3200m in central government support. We are making representations about that, but we're certainly not going to get more money tomorrow. Meanwhile we have had to plough money into our schools, and that has had to be our priority. But we have done our very best to protect the museums service. The museums - except one - are still open, there are exhibitions, things are still happening. We've just acquired two new paintings by Stanley Spencer.\"</p> <p>The department of culture, media and sport is now finally admitting the plight of English regional museums and preparing to tackle it - post-devolution Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish museums have their own problems and their own funding structures. More money for regional museums was earmarked in the chancellor's spending forecast, but the sector will have to wait until next month for the detailed allocation. Buried under the \u00a350m increase for sports and the \u00a3100m increase for the arts, there was a promise of \"a \u00a310 million funding package for regional museum, library and archive collections\".</p> <p>It is already clear that the money, though welcome, will not be enough to stop the rot. The indications from museum sources this week are that after the money earmarked for regional collections designated of national importance is taken away, the promised extra money will amount to less than \u00a35m.</p> <p>\"If you divvied that up evenly, every museum could have about \u00a35,000,\" says Maurice Davies of the Museums Association. \"Nobody could claim this will go any way to solving the problem. The best we can take it for is an earnest [sign] of goodwill.\"</p> <p>David Fleming, director of Tyne and Wear Museums, is unimpressed at the government's extra money for regional museums - his museum service, or Birmingham's or Glasgow's, could swallow the entire sum without plugging the gaps in the service.</p> <p>\"This has to be a problem for national government; it cannot be left as a problem for local politicians to decide how to make cuts in a non-statutory service. The extent of the underfunding and cuts means there is now a deficit in the country's museums of tens of millions of pounds, probably hundreds of millions. Our museums, in common with the big local authority ones, are now a third to a half under-resourced compared to 15 years ago.</p> <p>\"The irony is that at that time, by and large, we were doing a very poor job. Now we are doing everything we should be doing, transforming the outlook of museums and their relationship with their local communities, but we simply have not got the money to do the job properly.\"</p> <p>The anomaly in this situation is that the vast bulk of museum funding comes not from the culture department, but from John Prescott's sprawling department of transport, environment and the regions. The culture department funds only the main, \"national\" museums - mostly in London - while local authorities fund the rest of the country's museums.</p> <p>The dazzle of the huge Millennium- and Heritage Lottery- funded openings (including the Wallace, Dulwich and Somerset House galleries in London, the Lowry in Salford and the Walsall gallery), the extraordinary success of Tate Modern, as well as handsome new galleries for existing museums including Reading and Exeter, has obscured the truth about the crumbling backbone of the national museum and gallery service. The independent museums have their own problems, but the biggest crisis is in the local authority funded museums. Museums, unlike schools, rubbish collection and libraries, are not a statutory requirement for local authorities. In the annual turf wars for increasingly squeezed local authority resources, museums are losing out year on year.</p> <p>The government's new museums supremo is Matthew Evans, chairman of Faber and Faber publishers and now Lord Evans and chairman of Resource. He has warned museums they must change or die, and is urging them to think the unthinkable, to get their collections out of store and into the community - by selling or giving away duplicate objects if need be. He has warned them to specialise, to cooperate with one another, to break down the barriers with non museum visitor attractions such as heritage centres. But privately he is now convinced, as someone who came to the area as a sceptic, that the sector needs a lot more money.</p> <p>The museum industry knows it will have to become more politically astute in matching itself to the government's objectives and tapping into other sources of funding. \"There is other money out there,\" says Rosemary Elwes, secretary of the committee of Area Museum Councils. \"There's all sorts of development and education and regeneration and city challenge money, and museums should be ideally placed to take advantage of it. Strategic thinking and planning has never been more urgently needed.\"</p> <p>\"New staff are being taken on to fulfill what is seen as the government agenda, especially in areas such as outreach and social inclusion,\" she adds. \"There is nothing wrong with this, but it should not be at the expense of care of the collections.\"</p> <p>At Norton Priory Margaret Warhurst sighs wearily. She and her board have investigated every conceivable avenue of grant and sponsorship funding. Her museum has already completed a Heritage Lottery project, a new gallery to house its unique medieval wooden statue of Saint Christopher, and she cannot realistically see another lottery grant on the horizon. There is European regional money up for grabs, and a plethora of challenge funds already operated by the department and Resource.</p> <p>\"The problem is it takes so much time, when already there aren't enough people to do the work and so much of our time is taken up merely surviving, to find out about and apply for these schemes - and then there's no guarantee of success in the end.\"</p> <p>Nobody is even quite sure how many museums there are in Britain. The Museums Association has 700 members, Resource knows of 2,500, 1800 of them registered museums, and the trade bible, the Museums Yearbook, lists 3,000 museums and visitor centres. These range from the Cat Museum in Harrow - most recent recorded annual visitor numbers, 500 - to HM Prison Service Museum in Rugby, admission free and open by appointment only, which clocked up 7,000 visitors in 1994.</p> <p>David Barrie, who has just been appointed to the board of Resource, begs the government to cherish them before it is too late. \"Even people who do not visit museums themselves benefit from their existence, in the education services they offer, in the inspiration they provide, in the works of art and books and films which are indirectly sparked by museum collections. If you allow the flame of learning which they represent to gutter out, these will suffer in turn. The country will be immeasurably and irreperably impoverished.\"</p> <p>Additional research by Rebecca Ley</p>",

There are estimated to be over 80m visits each year to museums and galleries in the UK, but the report showed a 4% drop in visits in the year 1997-8 (partly explained by competition from new lottery- funded visitor attractions) and a 2.5% drop in the number of full-time staff to 12,590. The situation now is undoubtedly even worse. Those figures were collected just before or just after the 1997 local government reorganisation when the impact had yet to be felt of new unitary authorities taking on a huge range of museum responsibilities, or county wide museum services - as in Leicestershire - being split between town and county councils. Of the Area Museum Councils - which are funded through Resource by the department of culture - contacted by the Guardian, Yorkshire and Humberside, the North West, West and East Midlands, Eastern Region and the South East, all reported budget cuts and staff numbers falling in museums in their area, and a slight but noticeable drop in visitor numbers. The South West, which has dozens of tiny independent museums, is being supported by an army of unpaid volunteers - the award-winning Lyme Regis museum is entirely voluntarily staffed. Outright closures are rare, but in the last year the York Story, a popular heritage centre run by the York Museums Service, and the Wygston's House costume museum in one of the oldest houses in Leicester simply locked their doors. Others, like the ancient Stranger's Hall in Norwich, are no longer permanently staffed but open by appointment only on a couple of days a week. Museums in Ipswich and Exeter have fought off the worst threatened cuts this year but are braced for further assaults. The Museums Association has received recent alarm calls from museums in Luton, Billericay, and Portsmouth, from nationally important museums in Durham and Lancashire, from collections in pros perous Cheshire and in the more deprived Hackney Downs in east London. Most cuts are so gradual - half an hour here, half a day there, a senior curator with a lifetime of experience taking voluntary redundancy to be replaced by somebody younger and cheaper - that the scale of the problem is only gradually becoming apparent. \"It's death by a thousand cuts,\" says David Barrie. \"Taken individually these cuts might not seem disastrous, but they could add up to a national catastrophe.\" In Leicester the council leader, Ross Wilmott, is taking the flak for cuts in a service which he genuinely believes is essential to the vitality of his city. \"But Leicester is one of the worst funded local authorities in the country,\" he says. \"We have lost the equivalent of \u00a3200m in central government support. We are making representations about that, but we're certainly not going to get more money tomorrow. Meanwhile we have had to plough money into our schools, and that has had to be our priority. But we have done our very best to protect the museums service. The museums - except one - are still open, there are exhibitions, things are still happening. We've just acquired two new paintings by Stanley Spencer.\" The department of culture, media and sport is now finally admitting the plight of English regional museums and preparing to tackle it - post-devolution Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish museums have their own problems and their own funding structures. More money for regional museums was earmarked in the chancellor's spending forecast, but the sector will have to wait until next month for the detailed allocation. Buried under the \u00a350m increase for sports and the \u00a3100m increase for the arts, there was a promise of \"a \u00a310 million funding package for regional museum, library and archive collections\". It is already clear that the money, though welcome, will not be enough to stop the rot. The indications from museum sources this week are that after the money earmarked for regional collections designated of national importance is taken away, the promised extra money will amount to less than \u00a35m. \"If you divvied that up evenly, every museum could have about \u00a35,000,\" says Maurice Davies of the Museums Association. \"Nobody could claim this will go any way to solving the problem. The best we can take it for is an earnest [sign] of goodwill.\" David Fleming, director of Tyne and Wear Museums, is unimpressed at the government's extra money for regional museums - his museum service, or Birmingham's or Glasgow's, could swallow the entire sum without plugging the gaps in the service. \"This has to be a problem for national government; it cannot be left as a problem for local politicians to decide how to make cuts in a non-statutory service. The extent of the underfunding and cuts means there is now a deficit in the country's museums of tens of millions of pounds, probably hundreds of millions. Our museums, in common with the big local authority ones, are now a third to a half under-resourced compared to 15 years ago. \"The irony is that at that time, by and large, we were doing a very poor job. Now we are doing everything we should be doing, transforming the outlook of museums and their relationship with their local communities, but we simply have not got the money to do the job properly.\" The anomaly in this situation is that the vast bulk of museum funding comes not from the culture department, but from John Prescott's sprawling department of transport, environment and the regions. The culture department funds only the main, \"national\" museums - mostly in London - while local authorities fund the rest of the country's museums. The dazzle of the huge Millennium- and Heritage Lottery- funded openings (including the Wallace, Dulwich and Somerset House galleries in London, the Lowry in Salford and the Walsall gallery), the extraordinary success of Tate Modern, as well as handsome new galleries for existing museums including Reading and Exeter, has obscured the truth about the crumbling backbone of the national museum and gallery service. The independent museums have their own problems, but the biggest crisis is in the local authority funded museums. Museums, unlike schools, rubbish collection and libraries, are not a statutory requirement for local authorities. In the annual turf wars for increasingly squeezed local authority resources, museums are losing out year on year. The government's new museums supremo is Matthew Evans, chairman of Faber and Faber publishers and now Lord Evans and chairman of Resource. He has warned museums they must change or die, and is urging them to think the unthinkable, to get their collections out of store and into the community - by selling or giving away duplicate objects if need be. He has warned them to specialise, to cooperate with one another, to break down the barriers with non museum visitor attractions such as heritage centres. But privately he is now convinced, as someone who came to the area as a sceptic, that the sector needs a lot more money. The museum industry knows it will have to become more politically astute in matching itself to the government's objectives and tapping into other sources of funding. \"There is other money out there,\" says Rosemary Elwes, secretary of the committee of Area Museum Councils. \"There's all sorts of development and education and regeneration and city challenge money, and museums should be ideally placed to take advantage of it. Strategic thinking and planning has never been more urgently needed.\" \"New staff are being taken on to fulfill what is seen as the government agenda, especially in areas such as outreach and social inclusion,\" she adds. \"There is nothing wrong with this, but it should not be at the expense of care of the collections.\" At Norton Priory Margaret Warhurst sighs wearily. She and her board have investigated every conceivable avenue of grant and sponsorship funding. Her museum has already completed a Heritage Lottery project, a new gallery to house its unique medieval wooden statue of Saint Christopher, and she cannot realistically see another lottery grant on the horizon. There is European regional money up for grabs, and a plethora of challenge funds already operated by the department and Resource. \"The problem is it takes so much time, when already there aren't enough people to do the work and so much of our time is taken up merely surviving, to find out about and apply for these schemes - and then there's no guarantee of success in the end.\" Nobody is even quite sure how many museums there are in Britain. The Museums Association has 700 members, Resource knows of 2,500, 1800 of them registered museums, and the trade bible, the Museums Yearbook, lists 3,000 museums and visitor centres. These range from the Cat Museum in Harrow - most recent recorded annual visitor numbers, 500 - to HM Prison Service Museum in Rugby, admission free and open by appointment only, which clocked up 7,000 visitors in 1994. David Barrie, who has just been appointed to the board of Resource, begs the government to cherish them before it is too late. \"Even people who do not visit museums themselves benefit from their existence, in the education services they offer, in the inspiration they provide, in the works of art and books and films which are indirectly sparked by museum collections. If you allow the flame of learning which they represent to gutter out, these will suffer in turn. The country will be immeasurably and irreperably impoverished.\" Additional research by Rebecca Ley",

Only one point is irrefutable: it cannot continue like this.</p> <p>The wealth that once made Glasgow the second city of the empire has slipped away. Its legacy, however, remains: one of the great city collections of Europe, with eight main museums and galleries bulging with 1.5m objects. But from Old Masters to rusting armour the problem is constant: how to preserve and utilise the collection when inadequate funding has brought it to crisis point.</p> <p>\"Of all the cities in Europe, Glasgow was the one that led the way in changing its international standing and perception through tourism based on museums,\" said Neil McGregor, director of the National Gallery in London. \"If Glasgow is in crisis now, what does this bode for the rest of Britain's municipal museums - and tourism?\"</p> <p>Polly Smith, the city's senior conservator, admits she has no idea what state many of the 3,500 canvases are in. The results of a survey now under way may make uncomfortable reading. Ms Smith is Glasgow's only fine art conservator, and she does what she euphemistically calls \"prioritising\".

      "bodyText": "In store rooms across the city, the careful touch of the Renaissance masters is flaking. Cracks appear on 15th century canvas, and first aid maintenance is the best that can be applied. Alongside lie other works, gradually deteriorating. No one is certain of the extent of the malaise. Only one point is irrefutable: it cannot continue like this. The wealth that once made Glasgow the second city of the empire has slipped away. Its legacy, however, remains: one of the great city collections of Europe, with eight main museums and galleries bulging with 1.5m objects. But from Old Masters to rusting armour the problem is constant: how to preserve and utilise the collection when inadequate funding has brought it to crisis point. \"Of all the cities in Europe, Glasgow was the one that led the way in changing its international standing and perception through tourism based on museums,\" said Neil McGregor, director of the National Gallery in London. \"If Glasgow is in crisis now, what does this bode for the rest of Britain's municipal museums - and tourism?\" Polly Smith, the city's senior conservator, admits she has no idea what state many of the 3,500 canvases are in. The results of a survey now under way may make uncomfortable reading. Ms Smith is Glasgow's only fine art conservator, and she does what she euphemistically calls \"prioritising\".

      "body": "<p>Tatiana Riabouchinska, who has died aged 83, will be remembered as one of the three \"baby ballerinas\" whose youth and exceptional artistry did so much to establish and ensure the success of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, the company which, after the death of its founder Sergei Diaghilev, kept the art of ballet alive throughout the 1930s and beyond.</p> <p>The \"baby ballerinas\" - the others were Irina Baronova and Tamara Toumanova - were \u00e9migr\u00e9 Russians discovered by George Balanchine when he was helping to form the company. All three came from the Paris studios of those great teachers, all former ballerinas of the Imperial Russian Ballet, whose teaching formed generations of the best dancers in Europe. Baronova and Toumanova, the youngest, were pupils of Olga Preobrajenska, but Riabouchinska was a pupil of Mathilde Kschessinska, former ballerina assoluta and mistress of the Tsarevich Nikolai, later Tsar Nikolai II.</p> <p>Tatiana's father was banker to the Tsar and therefore not spared during the Russian revolution. The whole family was put under house arrest and tied up while the house was ransacked. They all expected to be shot. However, their own servants released them and helped the mother and four children to escape. They left Russia via a route through the Caucasus, arriving eventually in the south of France and thence to Paris.</p> <p>Tatiana's first teacher in Paris was Alexander Volinine, Bolshoi trained, one time partner of Anna Pavlova, and a teacher famous for his ability to develop elevation. She then went to Kschessinska, an old friend of her family from Tsarist days. At 14 she was chosen by Nikita Baileff to join his fashionable Russian variety show, the Chauve Souris, and appeared as Diana the Huntress in a costume created by Schiaparelli. Balanchine saw her in this and signed her for Monte Carlo.</p> <p>In the company's first season of 1932, she created the role of the Child in Leonide Max Massine's Jeu d'enfants, created roles in Balanchine's Concurrence and Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, and danced the role of the Mistress of Ceremonies in his lovely and haunting Cotillon.</p> <p>At the very beginning of her career, Riabouchinska inspired first Balanchine and then Massine. She created roles in the first three of Massine's famous (at that time controversial) \"symphonic\" ballets: Frivolity in Les Presages (Tchaikovsky's Fifth), the third and fourth movements in Choreartium (Brahms' Fourth), both 1933, and Reverie in Symphonie Fantastique (Berlioz) 1936. She also danced an enormous number of roles in the Ballet Russe repertoire and when Fokine joined the company between 1937 and 1939, he made the roles of the Golden Cockerel in Le Coq d'or, the title role in Cendrillon, and the Florentine Beauty in Paganini especially for her.</p> <p>Working with Fokine she had the opportunity to be coached by the choreographer himself in Les Sylphides and Le Spectre de la Rose. Her dancing of the Prelude in Les Sylphides became legendary, and she was to retain this role throughout her career. Her lightness, her soft soaring jump, her exquisite footwork, combined with her innate musicality, lifted the simple dance to a new, utterly poetic plane.</p> <p>Riabouchinska created many roles in ballets by David Lichine, the dancer and choreographer whom she married in 1943 - among them Le Pavillon (1936); La Creation, for Les Ballets des Champs-Elysees (1948); and, perhaps happiest and most charming of them all, the Romantic Girl in Graduation Ball (1940). With Lichine she made guest appearances with many companies after they left the Ballet Russe and, thanks to Anton Dolin, Riabouchinska danced in London with the Festival Ballet in the early 1950s. Thus a younger generation was able to appreciate her rare quality.</p> <p>In retirement, the Lichines devoted their energies to their dance academy in Beverly Hills and to founding several small companies. Alas, Riabouchinska's dream of establishing a permanent company in Los Angeles was never realised - sponsorship simply was not forthcoming.</p> <p>Described as \"the most unusual dancer of her generation\", Riabouchinska won plaudits from tthe most distinguished critics of the day. The Guardian's James Monahan, who witnessed most of her career, early described her speed and quick footwork as \"an embodied scherzo\".</p> <p>Let the American critic and poet Edwin Denby have the last word: \"Her naturalness in action comes from the fact that she shows you so clearly the sustaining impetus, the dance impulse which carries her lightly through from beginning to end. Because the impetus is exactly right she strikes you as dancing her whole number on an impulse, spontaneously for the joy of it.\"</p> <p>I saw Riabouchinska only towards the end of her career, but that quality of joy is the one I recognised and the one which stays with me.</p> <p>\u0095 Tatiana Riabouchinska born May 23, 1917; died August 24, 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tatiana Riabouchinska, who has died aged 83, will be remembered as one of the three \"baby ballerinas\" whose youth and exceptional artistry did so much to establish and ensure the success of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, the company which, after the death of its founder Sergei Diaghilev, kept the art of ballet alive throughout the 1930s and beyond. The \"baby ballerinas\" - the others were Irina Baronova and Tamara Toumanova - were \u00e9migr\u00e9 Russians discovered by George Balanchine when he was helping to form the company. All three came from the Paris studios of those great teachers, all former ballerinas of the Imperial Russian Ballet, whose teaching formed generations of the best dancers in Europe. Baronova and Toumanova, the youngest, were pupils of Olga Preobrajenska, but Riabouchinska was a pupil of Mathilde Kschessinska, former ballerina assoluta and mistress of the Tsarevich Nikolai, later Tsar Nikolai II. Tatiana's father was banker to the Tsar and therefore not spared during the Russian revolution. The whole family was put under house arrest and tied up while the house was ransacked. They all expected to be shot. However, their own servants released them and helped the mother and four children to escape. They left Russia via a route through the Caucasus, arriving eventually in the south of France and thence to Paris. Tatiana's first teacher in Paris was Alexander Volinine, Bolshoi trained, one time partner of Anna Pavlova, and a teacher famous for his ability to develop elevation. She then went to Kschessinska, an old friend of her family from Tsarist days. At 14 she was chosen by Nikita Baileff to join his fashionable Russian variety show, the Chauve Souris, and appeared as Diana the Huntress in a costume created by Schiaparelli. Balanchine saw her in this and signed her for Monte Carlo. In the company's first season of 1932, she created the role of the Child in Leonide Max Massine's Jeu d'enfants, created roles in Balanchine's Concurrence and Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, and danced the role of the Mistress of Ceremonies in his lovely and haunting Cotillon. At the very beginning of her career, Riabouchinska inspired first Balanchine and then Massine. She created roles in the first three of Massine's famous (at that time controversial) \"symphonic\" ballets: Frivolity in Les Presages (Tchaikovsky's Fifth), the third and fourth movements in Choreartium (Brahms' Fourth), both 1933, and Reverie in Symphonie Fantastique (Berlioz) 1936. She also danced an enormous number of roles in the Ballet Russe repertoire and when Fokine joined the company between 1937 and 1939, he made the roles of the Golden Cockerel in Le Coq d'or, the title role in Cendrillon, and the Florentine Beauty in Paganini especially for her. Working with Fokine she had the opportunity to be coached by the choreographer himself in Les Sylphides and Le Spectre de la Rose. Her dancing of the Prelude in Les Sylphides became legendary, and she was to retain this role throughout her career. Her lightness, her soft soaring jump, her exquisite footwork, combined with her innate musicality, lifted the simple dance to a new, utterly poetic plane. Riabouchinska created many roles in ballets by David Lichine, the dancer and choreographer whom she married in 1943 - among them Le Pavillon (1936); La Creation, for Les Ballets des Champs-Elysees (1948); and, perhaps happiest and most charming of them all, the Romantic Girl in Graduation Ball (1940). With Lichine she made guest appearances with many companies after they left the Ballet Russe and, thanks to Anton Dolin, Riabouchinska danced in London with the Festival Ballet in the early 1950s. Thus a younger generation was able to appreciate her rare quality. In retirement, the Lichines devoted their energies to their dance academy in Beverly Hills and to founding several small companies. Alas, Riabouchinska's dream of establishing a permanent company in Los Angeles was never realised - sponsorship simply was not forthcoming. Described as \"the most unusual dancer of her generation\", Riabouchinska won plaudits from tthe most distinguished critics of the day. The Guardian's James Monahan, who witnessed most of her career, early described her speed and quick footwork as \"an embodied scherzo\". Let the American critic and poet Edwin Denby have the last word: \"Her naturalness in action comes from the fact that she shows you so clearly the sustaining impetus, the dance impulse which carries her lightly through from beginning to end. Because the impetus is exactly right she strikes you as dancing her whole number on an impulse, spontaneously for the joy of it.\" I saw Riabouchinska only towards the end of her career, but that quality of joy is the one I recognised and the one which stays with me. \u0095 Tatiana Riabouchinska born May 23, 1917; died August 24, 2000",

Jon Moran Liverpool John Moores University \u0095 Many Loyalists are antediluvian thugs. Rather more are misguided and out of touch with reality. But there are subtle, sophisticated Protestants as well, and a deal of good will among ordinary unionists inside and outside of the ghettos. Greenslade should try talking to some of the moderate majority before he next sounds off about the essential decency and honour of his IRA muckers. Walter Ellis London walter_ellis@lineone.net \u0095 Following your article A tiger by the tail (August 19), I'm looking for like-minded people to form an Irish media group. Too often the media use put-downs, caricatures and bias in dealing with Irish people and affairs. If you are fed up with the way the media routinely makes a mockery of us and often uses other Irish to do so (Letters, August 26), please email me. Seamus Carey London Seamus_A_Carey@yahoo.co.uk",
