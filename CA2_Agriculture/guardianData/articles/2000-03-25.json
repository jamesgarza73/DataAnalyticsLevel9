Valencia, needing only to draw to reach the quarter-finals and aware that Fiorentina were beating Bordeaux 3-1, did not want to risk defeat and elimination. United, their position as group winners safe beyond reasonable doubt, just wanted to go home. </p> <p>At the end the teams trooped off happily having played out a scoreless draw to their own mutual satisfaction. Yet this was hardly what Gabriel Hanot had in mind when, in the 50s, he promoted the idea of having the champions of the European leagues compete for a cup on a seasonal basis. </p> <p>Hanot, a French selector and former international, was also a journalist on L'Equipe. His dream of creating a tournament which would bring out the best in the cream of Europe's footballers was quickly realised: first Real Madrid, then Benfica and the Milan teams, followed by Celtic, Manchester United, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Liverpool. Each brought a new distinction to what for years was the greatest club competition in the world. </p> <p>But what price the European Cup, aka the Champions League, now? For many observers it has grown too big for its boots, sacrificing quality for quantity in an effort to appease the clubs threatening to break away and form their own European league. </p> <p>The original European Cup, in 1955-56, involved 29 matches. Already this season 224 games have been played simply to reach the quarter-finals. Few of them have been memorable and even the better matches - Arsenal against Barcelona, for example, and Manchester United's recent encounter with Fiorentina - have quickly been forgotten amid the intensity of the fixture list. </p> <p>European Cup matches used to be special occasions to lift the seasonal slog of the domestic league programmes. Now the Champions League itself has become a treadmill, losing much of the original tournament's raison d' etre. </p> <p>Even the title of the present competition is a misnomer since only a minority of the participants are actually champions. Allowing the holders automatic entry into the following season's European Cup always seemed a mite generous but now that the teams placed second and third are eligible, calling it a league of champions amounts to a false description. </p> <p>What we have instead is an unwieldy hybrid, the result of a series of compromises agreed by Uefa in the face of consistent pressure by the leading clubs to be allowed to play European football on a regular basis without the fear of being knocked out before they have made a decent profit. </p> <p>The major television companies in Europe have also been a significant influence, reasoning that, since they are paying considerable sums for exclusive coverage, teams in which they have specific national interests cannot be allowed to disappear off their screens after one tie. </p> <p>The upshot of all this is three qualifying rounds followed by a series of mini-leagues before the competition starts to resemble the European Cup of old. And after this season's final has been played at Stade de France on May 24 it will be only eight weeks before the whole business starts afresh. </p> <p>If the result of a revamped Champions League was night after night of enthralling games which carried football to hitherto unscaled heights of technical excellence there would be less cynicism about the motives behind the exercise. So far, however, the evidence suggests that the football is suffering in the gadarene rush to make as much money out of the tournament as possible. </p> <p>Should the quarter-finals between Manchester United and Real Madrid and Barcelona and Chelsea turn out to be classics of their kind this will simply prove that the old two-legged cup format was preferable to having group phases which inevitably lead to percentage performances by the players and dead fixtures. </p> <p>Throughout the month of March there have been Champions League games each Tuesday or Wednesday and even such confirmed Europhiles as Martin Edwards, the chairman of Manchester United, and the Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli feel the whole thing has grown too big. As Edwards points out, United did not vote for the last increase from 24 clubs to 32. </p> <p>Yet when Uefa and the clubs met last month there was general approval for the latest Champions League format, the only reservation being the rapid succession of matches in March. But, rather than reduce the overall size of the fixture list, many clubs favoured playing two games a week in preference to three or four in a row. </p> <p>So it would appear that, if Manchester United want to continue combining their dominance at home with a serious challenge in the Champions League, they will have to pace their seasons with even greater care while maintaining a strict sense of priorities.

      "body": "<p>Anyone seeking to demonstrate the Brechtian principle that every man's success is achieved at the expense of another man's failure could find no better example than West Ham's Paolo di Canio and Paulo Wanchope. </p> <p>Every ounce of idolatry heaped on Di Canio is matched by the vitriol poured on Wanchope by West Ham United supporters who have a love-hate relationship with the two players. They love Di Canio and hate Wanchope, who unless he scores a hat-trick in the opening 20 minutes against Wimbledon will be the target of further abuse at Upton Park today. </p> <p>Perhaps, as the manager Harry Redknapp suggests, it is all a matter of body language, because they are twin strikers with not a single genetic similarity. Di Canio, small, Italian, hyperactive and ever so slightly bonkers, plays like a man who believes every word Bill Shankly ever said about the importance of football. Alongside him Wanchope, a gangly, quiet Costa Rican who is so laid-back that he makes Lennox Lewis look animated, appears to be going through the motions. </p> <p>Wanchope is not helped by still having the appearance of a leggy and raw yearling, the long windmilling limbs which propelled him so successfully across the basketball court at the University of South California looking out of place on a football pitch. One critic described him as a dancing octopus, and Jim Smith, who paid \u00a31.2m to take him to Derby, said that he had Faustino Asprilla's ability and Carlton Palmer's legs. A reverse of that description would have been deeply insulting, though nothing to the abuse of Hammers' fans. </p> <p>Redknapp says: \"They have been on at him almost since day one. Maybe because of his laid-back manner they think he doesn't try hard enough, yet he hasn't been a bit of bother, he trains hard every day and I believe he is a handful for defenders. Even Alex Ferguson said so after we'd played Man United. </p> <p>\"But it is very difficult for him to cope with what's happening.

      "bodyText": "Anyone seeking to demonstrate the Brechtian principle that every man's success is achieved at the expense of another man's failure could find no better example than West Ham's Paolo di Canio and Paulo Wanchope. Every ounce of idolatry heaped on Di Canio is matched by the vitriol poured on Wanchope by West Ham United supporters who have a love-hate relationship with the two players. They love Di Canio and hate Wanchope, who unless he scores a hat-trick in the opening 20 minutes against Wimbledon will be the target of further abuse at Upton Park today. Perhaps, as the manager Harry Redknapp suggests, it is all a matter of body language, because they are twin strikers with not a single genetic similarity. Di Canio, small, Italian, hyperactive and ever so slightly bonkers, plays like a man who believes every word Bill Shankly ever said about the importance of football. Alongside him Wanchope, a gangly, quiet Costa Rican who is so laid-back that he makes Lennox Lewis look animated, appears to be going through the motions. Wanchope is not helped by still having the appearance of a leggy and raw yearling, the long windmilling limbs which propelled him so successfully across the basketball court at the University of South California looking out of place on a football pitch. One critic described him as a dancing octopus, and Jim Smith, who paid \u00a31.2m to take him to Derby, said that he had Faustino Asprilla's ability and Carlton Palmer's legs. A reverse of that description would have been deeply insulting, though nothing to the abuse of Hammers' fans. Redknapp says: \"They have been on at him almost since day one. Maybe because of his laid-back manner they think he doesn't try hard enough, yet he hasn't been a bit of bother, he trains hard every day and I believe he is a handful for defenders. Even Alex Ferguson said so after we'd played Man United. \"But it is very difficult for him to cope with what's happening. I don't care who you are, it is very hard to go out there and perform with fans screaming abuse at you all the time.\" Redknapp may find himself the target of some today after revealing that he turned down a \u00a34m bid from Leicester's Martin O'Neill for Wanchope just before Thursday's transfer deadline, a fee about \u00a33.9m higher than West Ham fans rate him. But Redknapp, who has stood by his player all season, does not want to sell and Wanchope, who has taken the insults with quiet dignity, does not want to move.

Less than two weeks ago Bruce Rioch resigned as manager, complaining that the club lacked the ambition and the resources to make progress. </p> <p>\"The short answer to Bruce's remarks is 'Total rubbish'. Apart from just a few clubs in the Premiership, everybody is struggling with wages,\" Smith said. \"It's not lack of ambition but you have to balance the books.

Bruce's argument does not hold a lot of water.\" </p> <p><strong> Vibrant humour</strong><br> </p> <p>Behind the desk of her office - a converted executive box - Smith is every bit as determinedly efficient, practical and calm as in front of the television cameras, although her sense of humour is much more obvious, vibrant peals of laughter replacing the fleeting smile of the small screen. </p> <p>Mention the lack of women in the nation's boardrooms and her laughter is suffused with irony. \"Dear, dear, tell me about it. If you go to the Stadium of Light, which I have now renamed the Stadium of Darkness, they don't allow any women at all in the boardroom. I'm allowed in because I'm a director, but all the wives are hived off to another room so I go with them. It happens at so many places and it's so old-fashioned.\" </p> <p>The English have a natural distrust of those who display excellence in more than one field, so it is perhaps natural to suggest that the country's most famous (and wealthy) television cook is not really \"football director material\". In fact she and her husband, the publisher and writer Michael Wynn Jones, have had a 58% stake in the club since 1996. </p> <p>\"The thing is that because I have a high profile people tend to exaggerate my influence here. We have a great chairman [Bob Cooper] and when we have a crisis, as when Bruce left, everybody works as a team. Some cynical people think I always have to have my own way, but it isn't true.\" </p> <p>Having turned down a third BBC television series to concentrate on the club, she is channelling all her energies into expanding the in-house catering at Carrow Road, but emphasises that this is solely to support the football.

Unlike normal bindings which are screwed into the ski, the Pilot binding is held onto the ski directly above the edge by rigid metal arches that allow the ski to flex naturally. The Pilot comes in five models: three freeride ski/ bindings and two carve ski/ bindings. The skis are twin-tipped and cost \u00a3530-\u00a3550.

The unique feature of the Moors is their evidence of jet mining, and there are important remains of glass- and iron-making from the 16th century and earlier. Vyner recommends Levisham Moor, three miles west of the Bridestones at Dalby Forest: it's accessible to the public and contains Iron Age enclosures, Bronze Age burial mounds and medieval farming systems. The practicals Stations at Thirsk, Malton, Scarborough and a dozen Esk valley villages on the Middlesbrough to Whitby line. The North York Moors National Park runs Moorsbus in the summer, designed to link villages and help walkers leave the car behind.

      "body": "<p>I am not used to being regarded as a god - unless you are thinking of Buddha - though apparently he wasn't divine at all. Something about he whose belly hangs over his belt shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. Mirror In The Bathroom (Please don't scream), that was my song. I lost the will to face reflective surfaces sometime in the late 1980s. A man has to eat. </p> <p>Until I went to India, I never knew how it felt to be Sean Connery. True, we have the same haircut and - as you may have noticed - a unique way of mangling the English language, but there the similarities end. No, it was more the film of Kipling's short story about Daniel Dravot, where Connery played the runaway squaddie who became a god king, that I was thinking of. </p> <p>My Man Who Would Be King moment came the morning a holy man sitting in the shadow of a 3,500-year-old mango tree thumbed a blood-red bindi to my forehead. I did not know it at the time, but for the 10 rupees I dropped on his plate, I was buying divinity. </p> <p>The first inklings of my new celestial status came when I stepped out of an old bull-nosed Hindustani Ambassador into the monsoon mud of the temple town of Kanchipuram. High on incense, and with my head still swimming after watching 108 granite phallic linga being given their morning bath of aromatic oils and coconut milk - now that's what I call pandering to the male ego - a small roadside shrine stopped me with a thump. </p> <p>There, outside a TV store, was Ganesh holding a satellite dish. Ganesh is the god of good luck on account of how his father mistakenly lopped off his head and replaced it with an elephant's one. Luck like that, I know all about. Yet he was lucky for me. Here was my first piece of unmissable Indian kitsch. And only a few metres away, as if planted there by Paul Theroux himself, was a sign in front of a jumble of market stalls which warned, \"Caution, drive slowly, bizarre area.\" It was my duty as a tourist from a country that has gone beyond belief to record this with all due sense of irony. </p> <p>So smug was I in the warm glow of superiority that such ironies bring that it took me a while to notice that the flocks of bicycles skidding through the puddles had all stopped to stare at me. Behind them, portly Indian pilgrims were taking pictures of me from the window of their Easy Go Jolly Boys tour bus. Suddenly I was the freak. One buck with orange teeth was pointing at me and laughing manically, but mostly this was a frighteningly solemn assembly. </p> <p>Now I knew staring was an Olympic sport in India but this was ridiculous. Westerners were surely not that much of novelty in this part of northern Tamil Nadu. Had I caused some grave offence? </p> <p>For some unfathomable reason, I said, \"It's all right, I'm Irish.\" A murmur went through the crowd. One very frail old man in a lungi sarong and loose turban moved forward and touched the sleeve of the kurta I had bought back in Brick Lane so I'd look less conspicuous. I put my hands together, and give him my best Ravi Shankar bow and beatific smile, thinking he was probably admiring my Bengali threads straight from the designer sweatshops of Bethnal Green. He mumbled something that ended in \"gee\" and backed off bowing. Drawing myself up to my full height, I walked back to the car trying to pretend there was no one there, and the multitude parted before me like the Red Sea before Moses. </p> <p>The crowds thinned and the country grew more rugged as we headed down the coast to the ancient city of Mahabalipuram, whose pagoda-like shore temples are proof of the spread of Buddhism and Hinduism from southern India as far as Vietnam and the Indonesian archipelago. This was the port of the Pallavas, and the home of their greatest masons. Every granite outcrop had been carved with some eye-popping scene from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana - demons, elephants and meditating mystics in medieval 3D - and from behind each of these boulders a small crowd and some scrawny goats would appear and follow me at a respectful distance. </p> <p>A new god had recently joined the pantheon that stare from the masons' workshops. She was taller and lither than the squat local deities, and the fact that she was carved from black granite made her look, with some poignancy, like a photographic negative. The masons call this new goddess Queen Diana. And even they laid down their chisels to gawk at me. </p> <p>The silence was equally deafening when I walked into the dining room of the nearby hotel until a plate hit the floor. I checked my fly and disappeared to the bathroom. After smiling as benignly as I could at the toilet attendant who had backed up goggle-eyed against a sink, I checked myself in the mirror. No, nothing unusual but for the bindi on my forehead. Pretty fetching I thought. I might even start wearing it to Millwall matches. </p> <p>The waiter who brought my biryiani stooped to place the plate in front of me then swivelled his head alarmingly so he could look straight up into my face. After about five seconds I winked at him, just in case he'd had a stroke. He withdrew, still staring, to a gaggle of other waiters who were peering at me from the safety of the kitchen door. A middle-aged woman of some authority then approached and, after some elaborately convoluted pleasantries, told me I looked remarkably like a \"great Indian\" who was also \"very pale and handsome with very little hair like you. We are honoured to have you at our hotel.\" Meanwhile, my biryiani was being videoed for posterity by an Indian tourist at the next table. </p> <p>The great patriot in question was Sanjay Gandhi, whose crusade to sterilise his less fortunate countrymen was itself nipped in the bud by a mysterious plane crash. </p> <p>Like many middle-class Indians, my host was convinced Sanjay the Snipper had the right idea. I was not so sure about a man who brought vasectomy to the masses whether they liked it or not. And I was not all that happy about being his ghost either. This was one apparition which did not want to rely on India's fabled capacity for forgiveness. The bindi would have to go, and I resolved to wear my silly Australian bush hat, in bed if need be. Some indignities were worth suffering for the sake of securing the family line. </p> <p>On the road back to Chennai, we passed a dusty village dominated by a sprawling, half-built memorial. It marked the spot where Rajiv Gandhi, Sanjay's younger brother who was brow-beaten into taking on the family business, was blown to bits by a Tamil Tiger suicide bomber who ran from the crowd at an election rally to embrace him. It all began to make sense. Many things in India are not as strange as they first seem. </p> <p>Reincarnation is certainly the only way to explain Indian driving. After a short hop to Bangalore, a twee Raj town of botanical gardens and bungalows now bursting under the strain of south India's digital revolution, we drove in the dying light through eternal village India, where centuries slip away with every mile.

It's hard to keep your karma when a 10-ton lorry with a head of a demon on the bonnet is bearing down on you.

But southern India is worth every little risk, and don't kid yourself - the only danger you are likely to encounter in an Indian five-star hotel is the edge of the crease on your sheets. It is not like other places. The clocks keep time and the policemen get allowances for the upkeep of their moustaches. </p> <p>As we neared Mysore, my chatty guide Mr Baskir grew more and more lyrical about the city, its people and its food.

And it was true, through the rickshaw fumes you could just catch the sweet warm whiff of jasmine. Mr Baskir, you'll be shocked to hear, is from Mysore. </p> <p> We bumped into the city as darkness fell behind the bouncing buttocks of a vast woman balanced on tiny moped. The mosques were lit up like Christmas trees for Ramadan and cattle garlanded in jasmine wandered through the narrow alleys of its bazaar. You would never have guessed from these sedate scenes that the forests around the city hid the lair of Veerappan, the most notorious bandit, poacher and sandalwood smuggler in all India. Poolan Devi, the Bandit Queen, and Robin Hood himself was nothing on the bold Veerappan, who had eluded the police and the army for 15 years, disappearing into thin air on more than five occasions when they thought they had cornered him.

      "bodyText": "I am not used to being regarded as a god - unless you are thinking of Buddha - though apparently he wasn't divine at all. Something about he whose belly hangs over his belt shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. Mirror In The Bathroom (Please don't scream), that was my song. I lost the will to face reflective surfaces sometime in the late 1980s. A man has to eat. Until I went to India, I never knew how it felt to be Sean Connery. True, we have the same haircut and - as you may have noticed - a unique way of mangling the English language, but there the similarities end. No, it was more the film of Kipling's short story about Daniel Dravot, where Connery played the runaway squaddie who became a god king, that I was thinking of. My Man Who Would Be King moment came the morning a holy man sitting in the shadow of a 3,500-year-old mango tree thumbed a blood-red bindi to my forehead. I did not know it at the time, but for the 10 rupees I dropped on his plate, I was buying divinity. The first inklings of my new celestial status came when I stepped out of an old bull-nosed Hindustani Ambassador into the monsoon mud of the temple town of Kanchipuram. High on incense, and with my head still swimming after watching 108 granite phallic linga being given their morning bath of aromatic oils and coconut milk - now that's what I call pandering to the male ego - a small roadside shrine stopped me with a thump. There, outside a TV store, was Ganesh holding a satellite dish. Ganesh is the god of good luck on account of how his father mistakenly lopped off his head and replaced it with an elephant's one. Luck like that, I know all about. Yet he was lucky for me. Here was my first piece of unmissable Indian kitsch. And only a few metres away, as if planted there by Paul Theroux himself, was a sign in front of a jumble of market stalls which warned, \"Caution, drive slowly, bizarre area.\" It was my duty as a tourist from a country that has gone beyond belief to record this with all due sense of irony. So smug was I in the warm glow of superiority that such ironies bring that it took me a while to notice that the flocks of bicycles skidding through the puddles had all stopped to stare at me. Behind them, portly Indian pilgrims were taking pictures of me from the window of their Easy Go Jolly Boys tour bus. Suddenly I was the freak. One buck with orange teeth was pointing at me and laughing manically, but mostly this was a frighteningly solemn assembly. Now I knew staring was an Olympic sport in India but this was ridiculous. Westerners were surely not that much of novelty in this part of northern Tamil Nadu. Had I caused some grave offence? For some unfathomable reason, I said, \"It's all right, I'm Irish.\" A murmur went through the crowd. One very frail old man in a lungi sarong and loose turban moved forward and touched the sleeve of the kurta I had bought back in Brick Lane so I'd look less conspicuous. I put my hands together, and give him my best Ravi Shankar bow and beatific smile, thinking he was probably admiring my Bengali threads straight from the designer sweatshops of Bethnal Green. He mumbled something that ended in \"gee\" and backed off bowing. Drawing myself up to my full height, I walked back to the car trying to pretend there was no one there, and the multitude parted before me like the Red Sea before Moses. The crowds thinned and the country grew more rugged as we headed down the coast to the ancient city of Mahabalipuram, whose pagoda-like shore temples are proof of the spread of Buddhism and Hinduism from southern India as far as Vietnam and the Indonesian archipelago.

      "body": "<p>The first time I went to Venice I was 20, and the city hit me like a falling campanile. We stayed in a frescoed room, overlooking a canal, in a palazzo owned by two ancient sisters and their brother. The place and the people seemed phantasmagoria from every European art movie ever made in grainy black and white. They had a pet sparrow who had the run of the ruined dining room, and lived in the only warm place, on top of the terrifying geyser water heater in the sinister windowless bathroom. I wasn't quite right in the head for months afterwards. </p> <p>Also staying in the palazzo - it was so ludicrously cheap it had got into a Europe-on-a-fistful-of-cents-a-day guide - was a gullible teenager from a Southern Baptist background. He had seen no building more ornate than his native corrugated-iron chapel, and had no exposure to religious art at all. When we went into a gallery and he was confronted with a room full of barn-door sized canvasses, of saints flayed, crucified, disembowelled, shot full of arrows and generally propelled into martyrdom he collapsed and had to be carried out and propped up on the steps. </p> <p>On John Ruskin, who was never quite right in the head, the city had a predictably tumultuous effect. Great Venetian art frequently felled him. When he visited the Scuolo San Rocco - still a place of the most staggering sombreness, grandeur and gloom, where the flickering Tintorettos seem to be painted in blood and tar, and the only glimmer of electric light is a 15-watt bulb over the dusty postcard stall - he had hysterics. Literally: he wrote to his father that he had been compelled to lie on a bench and roll around with laughter. </p> <p>The Sage of Coniston was only 16, travelling with his parents, when he first visited the city. Venice got into his blood like ague. He said it taught him everything he ever knew about art and architecture. He said he was \"a foster child of Venice\" - as opposed to the blood child of elderly and domineering parents: a mordantly religious mother who wanted him to become a bishop, and a millionaire sherry-importing father who would have settled for a poet laureate. </p> <p>Ruskin went back again and again, looking, buying, measuring, drawing. Forever after he could hardly look at an English haystack without being reminded of a peeling Venetian wall. </p> <p>Anyone who hadn't known that there was something odd about his marriage to Effie Gray might have deduced some tiny problem from their long stay in Venice when she went shopping, taking tea with English residents and dancing with Viennese officers, and he spent his days teetering on long ladders up the face of San Marco, so obsessively meticulous that architects have been able to check any later alterations against his measurements. It's not surprising that communication faltered slightly when the couple met later in bed in the Gritti Palace. </p> <p>Like generations of earlier and later visitors, and me as a brattish 20 year old, Ruskin thought he'd discovered Venice and that nobody else alive or dead was capable of truly appreciating it - least of all the appalling Venetians, lounging about in the piazza San Marco, gossiping and listening to the army bands of their Viennese invaders, instead of dropping to their knees to worship the marble pillars looted from Constantinople. </p> <p>He knew that he alone could save Venice, that nobody else could see the peril it was in. He raged about the delightful pink Murano glass-shaded gas lamps, feeling they breathed the soul of Birmingham out over the waters of the lagoon. He raged about the trains. What he would have thought of the airport, the huge car park, and the small shabby campo which, on a foggy Venetian night, is now sinisterly lit by the yellow glow of the McDonalds arches, one shudders to imagine. </p> <p>He thought the city's treasury of buildings so abused and neglected that it would melt into the lagoon, \"like a lump of sugar in hot tea\". But he would have let them melt, stirred the cup, rather than see them mutilated by brutally ignorant \"restoration\" - he launched a debate that continues today, and it is poignant to see how many of the buildings he admired, and some he reviled, are once again propped, scaffolded, or undergoing major repairs. </p> <p>If Ruskin sneezed, he wrote an essay about it. On a subject that really got him by the short and curlies, there was no stopping the man. On Venice, he wrote half a million words. </p> <p>Splendid chaps like our own architecture correspondent Jonathan Glancey, or Professor Robert Hewison - curator of the sumptuous exhibition at the Tate, and the best guide to Ruskin's Venice anyone could kidnap - claim never to travel as far as the kitchen without taking the 39 volumes of the complete works of John Ruskin. Anyone else is likely to find him heavy going. I have to stop every few paragraphs to wait for the desire to bash him about the head to subside. But sometimes he is just so right - on the throat-catching beauty and loneliness of ruined Torcello, for instance, \"a waste of wild sea moor... a lurid ashen grey\" where nothing survives but two churches, some gravestones, a bell tower and a few inns - that one forgives him much. </p> <p>Sarah Quill has done all of us a service by producing a beautiful, readable, portable book: Ruskin's Venice, The Stones Revisited. She matches manageable quotes from Ruskin with his often exquisite drawings, and her own immaculate photographs. It is the friendliest companion to prop up with you, at the prow of a water bus travelling the length of the Grand Canal, unless you can kidnap Professor Hewison. </p> <p>It is possible to eat, and even stay in, some of Ruskin's stones of Venice. One of the inns on Torcello is still owned by the Cipriani family, who used to own the world-famous hotel and still keep the island restaurant as a family pet, the quintessence of the simple country inn, immaculately done and not cheap. Back in the centre, there is the wondrous Antica Locanda Montin, the walls panelled with paintings from artist guests - good, mediocre, and cherished - which has rooms to let, and, rarest of beasts in crowded Venice, a pergola-covered back garden where the tables are set in summer.

      "bodyText": "The first time I went to Venice I was 20, and the city hit me like a falling campanile. We stayed in a frescoed room, overlooking a canal, in a palazzo owned by two ancient sisters and their brother. The place and the people seemed phantasmagoria from every European art movie ever made in grainy black and white. They had a pet sparrow who had the run of the ruined dining room, and lived in the only warm place, on top of the terrifying geyser water heater in the sinister windowless bathroom. I wasn't quite right in the head for months afterwards. Also staying in the palazzo - it was so ludicrously cheap it had got into a Europe-on-a-fistful-of-cents-a-day guide - was a gullible teenager from a Southern Baptist background. He had seen no building more ornate than his native corrugated-iron chapel, and had no exposure to religious art at all. When we went into a gallery and he was confronted with a room full of barn-door sized canvasses, of saints flayed, crucified, disembowelled, shot full of arrows and generally propelled into martyrdom he collapsed and had to be carried out and propped up on the steps. On John Ruskin, who was never quite right in the head, the city had a predictably tumultuous effect. Great Venetian art frequently felled him. When he visited the Scuolo San Rocco - still a place of the most staggering sombreness, grandeur and gloom, where the flickering Tintorettos seem to be painted in blood and tar, and the only glimmer of electric light is a 15-watt bulb over the dusty postcard stall - he had hysterics. Literally: he wrote to his father that he had been compelled to lie on a bench and roll around with laughter. The Sage of Coniston was only 16, travelling with his parents, when he first visited the city. Venice got into his blood like ague. He said it taught him everything he ever knew about art and architecture. He said he was \"a foster child of Venice\" - as opposed to the blood child of elderly and domineering parents: a mordantly religious mother who wanted him to become a bishop, and a millionaire sherry-importing father who would have settled for a poet laureate. Ruskin went back again and again, looking, buying, measuring, drawing. Forever after he could hardly look at an English haystack without being reminded of a peeling Venetian wall. Anyone who hadn't known that there was something odd about his marriage to Effie Gray might have deduced some tiny problem from their long stay in Venice when she went shopping, taking tea with English residents and dancing with Viennese officers, and he spent his days teetering on long ladders up the face of San Marco, so obsessively meticulous that architects have been able to check any later alterations against his measurements. It's not surprising that communication faltered slightly when the couple met later in bed in the Gritti Palace. Like generations of earlier and later visitors, and me as a brattish 20 year old, Ruskin thought he'd discovered Venice and that nobody else alive or dead was capable of truly appreciating it - least of all the appalling Venetians, lounging about in the piazza San Marco, gossiping and listening to the army bands of their Viennese invaders, instead of dropping to their knees to worship the marble pillars looted from Constantinople. He knew that he alone could save Venice, that nobody else could see the peril it was in. He raged about the delightful pink Murano glass-shaded gas lamps, feeling they breathed the soul of Birmingham out over the waters of the lagoon. He raged about the trains. What he would have thought of the airport, the huge car park, and the small shabby campo which, on a foggy Venetian night, is now sinisterly lit by the yellow glow of the McDonalds arches, one shudders to imagine. He thought the city's treasury of buildings so abused and neglected that it would melt into the lagoon, \"like a lump of sugar in hot tea\". But he would have let them melt, stirred the cup, rather than see them mutilated by brutally ignorant \"restoration\" - he launched a debate that continues today, and it is poignant to see how many of the buildings he admired, and some he reviled, are once again propped, scaffolded, or undergoing major repairs. If Ruskin sneezed, he wrote an essay about it. On a subject that really got him by the short and curlies, there was no stopping the man. On Venice, he wrote half a million words. Splendid chaps like our own architecture correspondent Jonathan Glancey, or Professor Robert Hewison - curator of the sumptuous exhibition at the Tate, and the best guide to Ruskin's Venice anyone could kidnap - claim never to travel as far as the kitchen without taking the 39 volumes of the complete works of John Ruskin. Anyone else is likely to find him heavy going. I have to stop every few paragraphs to wait for the desire to bash him about the head to subside. But sometimes he is just so right - on the throat-catching beauty and loneliness of ruined Torcello, for instance, \"a waste of wild sea moor... a lurid ashen grey\" where nothing survives but two churches, some gravestones, a bell tower and a few inns - that one forgives him much. Sarah Quill has done all of us a service by producing a beautiful, readable, portable book: Ruskin's Venice, The Stones Revisited. She matches manageable quotes from Ruskin with his often exquisite drawings, and her own immaculate photographs. It is the friendliest companion to prop up with you, at the prow of a water bus travelling the length of the Grand Canal, unless you can kidnap Professor Hewison. It is possible to eat, and even stay in, some of Ruskin's stones of Venice. One of the inns on Torcello is still owned by the Cipriani family, who used to own the world-famous hotel and still keep the island restaurant as a family pet, the quintessence of the simple country inn, immaculately done and not cheap. Back in the centre, there is the wondrous Antica Locanda Montin, the walls panelled with paintings from artist guests - good, mediocre, and cherished - which has rooms to let, and, rarest of beasts in crowded Venice, a pergola-covered back garden where the tables are set in summer. Ruskin loved it too. And, of course, there's the Gritti Palace, where the Ruskins rented a suite of rooms for a winter, now a seriously expensive hotel. The manager took us up to see their rooms, flinging open the great high windows and unlatching the shutters with a flourish, allowing the fog to come soughing in from the Grand Canal below. Their old rooms are part of the suites where Hemingway and Churchill also stayed. He was used to showing people the rooms, he said, if they were not let - it was off season and, in the deserted city, the Gritti was still almost full - visitors often came wanting to stay where Hemingway had stayed, and some even came for Churchill. Had anyone, ever, come looking for Ruskin's rooms? He laughed, and latched the shutters again.

Unlike most resorts that set a date for closing, the lift company at Les Grands Montets (Chamonix's best-known ski mountain in Argenti\u00e8re) has learned from experience to stay flexible. </p> <p>Too often, a date for the first week in May has been set and the heavens have responded by unleashing great dumps of snow. </p> <p>To avoid the wrath of hot-headed skiers, Chamonix will close when the snow stops. Late-season skiing is often some of the best of the year: snowfalls can be plentiful, the days are long and the sun is strong. Spring skiing also means corn snow when the conditions are crisp and smooth before getting too much exposure from the sun. </p> <p>In a normal year, many tour operators continue until Easter, but with Easter being so late this year - April 21-24 - most of the big ones will shut up shop by the middle of the month. There are, however, still many bargains available from smaller ski companies and, if you are prepared to opt for self-drive, the possibilities are endless. </p> <p>Late season means lower prices in the resorts and on the mountain. If you are prepared to do a bit of leg work on the internet, there is plenty of low-priced accommodation. Airlines such as Go and easyJet also have some great bargains but not at peak times such as weekends. Most important is that you choose a resort where the skiing is high and the bars are still open. These are some of the best: </p> <p><strong> Chamonix</strong><br> Serious skiers head to Argenti\u00e8re and the Grands Montets, but the Chamonix valley caters to all levels. Les Houches and Le Tour are the easiest areas and quite low. Le Brevent and La Fl\u00e9g\u00e8re, which are higher, have recently been linked and provide variety for beginners and intermediates as well as some excellent off-piste skiing. On a sunny day, the Vall\u00e9e Blanche glacier in the shadow of Mont Blanc is a magical run. It's not difficult and the scenery is breathtaking. </p> <p> For April (except Easter), Collineige Ski (01276 24262) offers seven nights in luxury catered-chalet accommodation for \u00a3595pp, including scheduled flights, transfer and minibus. Four nights: \u00a3550, Easter Weekend: \u00a3635, Easter week: \u00a3715.Self-drive High Mountain Holidays (01993 775540), May 5-8, \u00a3240, accommodation only. </p> <p><strong> Verbier </strong><br> An unlimited repertoire of exciting skiing - glaciers and couloirs, moguls and powder - and legendary nightlife. </p> <p>This is not a beginners' area, but intermediates will find more than enough to keep them busy at Savoleyres and Lac des Vaux. The Four Valley lift pass covers 400km of piste. </p> <p>For advanced and expert levels, the skiing is unlimited from Tortin, a steep and wide slope pounded into knee-high moguls, to the front face of Mont Gel\u00e9. From the top of the Mont Fort cable car, you can pick your route from red to black or some good off-piste off the back. If you are lucky enough to get fresh snowfalls, you will need to catch the first cablecar, otherwise you will find that famous runs such as Stairway to Heaven and the Hidden Valley are skied out. </p> <p> FlexiSki (0870 9090754), now owned by First Choice, will tailor-make any ski holiday. Its four-night weekends include three four-star hotels, one three-star and one B&amp;B. Prices, based on scheduled flights, transfer and half-board accommodation start at \u00a3510pp. Four nights, departing April 27, \u00a3395. Ski World (020-7602 4826) has seven nights' chalet accommodation from \u00a3299, including flights and transfer, departing April 22. </p> <p><strong> Val d'Is\u00e8re/Tignes </strong><br> Guaranteed snow on the Grand Motte glacier in Tignes makes this one of the most reliable for late skiing. It's large, well-linked, has extensive off piste and offers something for everyone. </p> <p>There are six separate ski areas in the L'Espace Killy, covering 300km of mostly intermediate skiing with 96 lifts. In late season, the efficient lift system means you'll never have to queue, so you'll need to be fit to make the most of the unlimited nooks and crannies. The Face de Bellevarde, reached by a funicular, is one of the most challenging downhill courses. </p> <p>Val's exuberant nightlife continues late in the season attracting good skiers and even better apr\u00e8s-skiers who like to play and party hard. </p> <p> YSE (020-8871 5117) offers seven nights, departing April 30, for \u00a3395, including flights, transfer and chalet accommodation. Bank Holiday weekend, April 27-May 1, from \u00a3375. Ski Olympic (01709 579999) has seven nights at Tignes, leaving April 22, from \u00a3365, including flight, transfer and catered-chalet.Mark Warner (020-7761 7002) has seven nights in Val d'Is\u00e8re, leaving April 23, including flight, transfer and catered-chalet. </p> <p><strong> M\u00e9ribel </strong><br> If you want to enjoy the favourite British haunt for access to the Trois Vall\u00e9es with no crowds, then go to M\u00e9ribel (above) in April. The vast Trois Vall\u00e9es ski area gives you flexibility, variety and reliable snow late into the season. </p> <p>If the snow gets patchy, head to Val Thorens, which at 2,300m is the highest resort in Europe. The sheer size of the Trois Vall\u00e9es means you must pay attention to the times of the last lifts.

      "bodyText": "Planning the end-of-season party in Chamonix is never easy. Unlike most resorts that set a date for closing, the lift company at Les Grands Montets (Chamonix's best-known ski mountain in Argenti\u00e8re) has learned from experience to stay flexible. Too often, a date for the first week in May has been set and the heavens have responded by unleashing great dumps of snow. To avoid the wrath of hot-headed skiers, Chamonix will close when the snow stops. Late-season skiing is often some of the best of the year: snowfalls can be plentiful, the days are long and the sun is strong. Spring skiing also means corn snow when the conditions are crisp and smooth before getting too much exposure from the sun. In a normal year, many tour operators continue until Easter, but with Easter being so late this year - April 21-24 - most of the big ones will shut up shop by the middle of the month. There are, however, still many bargains available from smaller ski companies and, if you are prepared to opt for self-drive, the possibilities are endless. Late season means lower prices in the resorts and on the mountain. If you are prepared to do a bit of leg work on the internet, there is plenty of low-priced accommodation. Airlines such as Go and easyJet also have some great bargains but not at peak times such as weekends. Most important is that you choose a resort where the skiing is high and the bars are still open. These are some of the best: Chamonix Serious skiers head to Argenti\u00e8re and the Grands Montets, but the Chamonix valley caters to all levels. Les Houches and Le Tour are the easiest areas and quite low. Le Brevent and La Fl\u00e9g\u00e8re, which are higher, have recently been linked and provide variety for beginners and intermediates as well as some excellent off-piste skiing. On a sunny day, the Vall\u00e9e Blanche glacier in the shadow of Mont Blanc is a magical run. It's not difficult and the scenery is breathtaking. For April (except Easter), Collineige Ski (01276 24262) offers seven nights in luxury catered-chalet accommodation for \u00a3595pp, including scheduled flights, transfer and minibus. Four nights: \u00a3550, Easter Weekend: \u00a3635, Easter week: \u00a3715.Self-drive High Mountain Holidays (01993 775540), May 5-8, \u00a3240, accommodation only. Verbier An unlimited repertoire of exciting skiing - glaciers and couloirs, moguls and powder - and legendary nightlife. This is not a beginners' area, but intermediates will find more than enough to keep them busy at Savoleyres and Lac des Vaux. The Four Valley lift pass covers 400km of piste. For advanced and expert levels, the skiing is unlimited from Tortin, a steep and wide slope pounded into knee-high moguls, to the front face of Mont Gel\u00e9. From the top of the Mont Fort cable car, you can pick your route from red to black or some good off-piste off the back. If you are lucky enough to get fresh snowfalls, you will need to catch the first cablecar, otherwise you will find that famous runs such as Stairway to Heaven and the Hidden Valley are skied out. FlexiSki (0870 9090754), now owned by First Choice, will tailor-make any ski holiday. Its four-night weekends include three four-star hotels, one three-star and one B&amp;B. Prices, based on scheduled flights, transfer and half-board accommodation start at \u00a3510pp. Four nights, departing April 27, \u00a3395. Ski World (020-7602 4826) has seven nights' chalet accommodation from \u00a3299, including flights and transfer, departing April 22. Val d'Is\u00e8re/Tignes Guaranteed snow on the Grand Motte glacier in Tignes makes this one of the most reliable for late skiing. It's large, well-linked, has extensive off piste and offers something for everyone. There are six separate ski areas in the L'Espace Killy, covering 300km of mostly intermediate skiing with 96 lifts. In late season, the efficient lift system means you'll never have to queue, so you'll need to be fit to make the most of the unlimited nooks and crannies. The Face de Bellevarde, reached by a funicular, is one of the most challenging downhill courses. Val's exuberant nightlife continues late in the season attracting good skiers and even better apr\u00e8s-skiers who like to play and party hard. YSE (020-8871 5117) offers seven nights, departing April 30, for \u00a3395, including flights, transfer and chalet accommodation. Bank Holiday weekend, April 27-May 1, from \u00a3375. Ski Olympic (01709 579999) has seven nights at Tignes, leaving April 22, from \u00a3365, including flight, transfer and catered-chalet.Mark Warner (020-7761 7002) has seven nights in Val d'Is\u00e8re, leaving April 23, including flight, transfer and catered-chalet. M\u00e9ribel If you want to enjoy the favourite British haunt for access to the Trois Vall\u00e9es with no crowds, then go to M\u00e9ribel (above) in April. The vast Trois Vall\u00e9es ski area gives you flexibility, variety and reliable snow late into the season. If the snow gets patchy, head to Val Thorens, which at 2,300m is the highest resort in Europe. The sheer size of the Trois Vall\u00e9es means you must pay attention to the times of the last lifts. It may take a few runs to get from M\u00e9ribel to the furthest corners of the Trois Vall\u00e9es, but if you miss the last lift it will be way past nightfall before you get home. M\u00e9ribel closes on April 24 but several small operators offer reduced rates for the month.

      "body": "<p>Kazuo Ishiguro was six years old in 1960 when his parents brought their small family, just Kazuo and his older sister Fumiko, from Nagasaki to live in Guildford, Surrey. It was, as Ishiguro explains, regarded very much as an adventure; the family never expected to stay long. His father, an oceanographer, was employed by the British government on a research project in the North Sea. As soon as the funding dried up, after a couple years it was anticipated, they would be back in Japan. So it happened, Ish says now, \"that I never properly said goodbye to Japan, only a temporary goodbye. For a long time, I simply assumed that we would return.\" Maybe, had they known it was forever, there would have been a more conscious holding on to Japan. Or a proper bereavement. But as things happened, \"It was just time, life, the world, that came along and rearranged things when I wasn't looking. The next time I looked, Japan was gone.\" </p> <p>Ten years after the family's arrival in England, Ishiguro's grandfather died in the old Nagasaki house where they had once lived together. They hadn't seen him since their departure. No one's fault, no one's choice. \"You have to realise that in those days travel wasn't as easy as it is today. It took three days to get to England from Japan.\" Most likely, Ishiguro says, he didn't appreciate at the time what a profound event in his life this death was. \"My grandfather had been my father- figure for the first four years of my life while my father was away on business.\" And his grandfather had remained his link with Japan. Every month, the old man would send him a parcel, \"big, thick\", containing the most popular children's magazine of the time, full of gifts and puzzles and the comic strip about Oba-q, a friendly family ghost - to keep Kazuo up-to-date with contemporary kids' culture, of course, so that he wouldn't feel lost among his friends when eventually he returned. </p> <p>In the 40 years since leaving Japan, Ishiguro has returned only once, on a brief \"author's tour\" in 1989 after the Japanese publication of his third novel, the Booker prize-winning The Remains Of The Day. Prior to this, although he had travelled extensively through Europe and America, he had deliberately avoided going back. \"Because, in my head, all these people are still alive. Against all rational knowledge, somewhere I believe that everything is running smoothly there, much the same way as it always did. The world of my childhood is still intact.\" As though to go back one would commit the crime of having them die all over again - this time in the powerful reality of the imagination. </p> <p>Anyway, back in 1960, the Ishiguro family settled happily into their semi-detached in Grange Close, a quiet cul-de-sac of 12 houses, which they rented from their friends, the Derbyshires, who had gone to live in South Africa. It must have been very strange for his mother Shizuko who, at 34, had never been outside Japan and who naturally spoke not a word of English. Perhaps less strange for his father, Shizuo, who had been here before. But there was no attempt, Ishiguro says, to recreate a mini-Japan in Guildford - difficult even if they had wanted to: \"This was long before you could buy sushi in the supermarket.\" It was a time when there were so few Japanese in Britain that on New Year's Day the ambassador would invite every Japanese present in the country to the embassy for a celebratory drink. \"And I don't think it was full,\" Ish says. </p> <p>His parents' attitude was: \"We are only here for a short time, so get into it.\" As he recalls, it was a quintessentially English house - \"fireplace and desk\" in the sitting room, though there were samurai scabbards on the mantelpiece. His mother socialised with all the neighbours. \"I remember with some surprise how kind everyone was to us, even strangers, and I think that was partly the way we looked - very sweet, doll-like. And partly that this was pre-Powell, and there weren't any ready-made views about foreigners.\" There was little simple stereotyping - the only vaguely unpleasant incident he recalls was the discovery that one of their neighbours had been in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. \"I looked at him slightly differently after that.\" But most of the experiences were more comic than anything else. For example, the Evanses, a family of religious zealots who lived across the street, would turn up every day \"to help out\" and to explain things to Mrs Ishiguro. \"I don't know what my mother really thought of them - she is far too nice ever to say anything against anyone.\" And as far as the Ishiguros knew, this was the way all Christians behaved. \"They were all the same to us.\" It was only years later, he says, that they discovered the Evanses' reputation. \"And that we were sitting targets, real mugs.\" </p> <p>Still, the family obviously felt at home there and must have liked it, because his parents live there still. Not in the same house. When, after some years, the Derbyshires returned from abroad, Mr and Mrs Ishiguro decided that rather than continue to rent they would like to buy. As luck would have it, at exactly that moment, the semi adjacent to the one they were renting came up for sale and they moved next door. What is odd, Ish says, is that the houses are exactly the same - \"furnished the same, even the view out of the window is the same\" - and yet fundamentally different: they are a mirror image of each other. \"Which is very confusing when I visit my parents. Because in my head, in the house I remember from my childhood, everything is always the other way round.\" </p> <p> It is a neat image, the two houses, joined and yet facing away from each other. A kind of dual inheritance that almost replicates Ishiguro's own experience. East and west; assimilated and displaced; reality and imagination; perception and projection. As he says himself, it is not easy to disentangle any of these couplings. But as a metaphor it is also schematic in just the right proportions. For Ishiguro, along with Kafka, is the great bureaucratic fabulist of anxiety. Anxiety is his imaginative architecture, and it is an anxiety that he imparts to his reader. It is one of the features of Ishiguro's writing that you can never work out which side he is on. Which house does he inhabit? The real one or the one in his mind? And, anyway, which one for him is the more real? </p> <p>The last time I met Ishiguro was just over four years ago, following the paperback publication of his fourth novel, The Unconsoled. At the time, he was bemused that the book had not received the unanimous praise of the first three novels. \"Not everyone came along for the ride.\" I remember he could quote some of the reviews. \"It invents its own category of badness,\" James Wood had written in this paper. And the Observer had put a photo of him on its front page with the caption: Is he bonkers? \"Or some such thing.\" Set in a nameless central European city, the book focused on the return of the celebrated pianist Mr Ryder to the town where he is scheduled to give a concert that never materialises. </p> <p>To some, it seemed inconceivable that the same sensibility that had written with such delicacy and refinement in An Artist Of The Floating World, A Pale View Of The Hills, The Remains Of The Day could write something so amorphous and inaccessible. The book is 600 pages of plotless, circular, sustained hallucination, and many of his readers just couldn't decode it. It may as well have been written - frankly - in Japanese. This sounds like a facile observation; but there may be something to it. Ishiguro is a communicator - he doesn't like obscurity in any form. If something about this book was incomprehensible to his audience, he decided, he would write it again and in a different way. In other words, he was convinced that it was not the experience that was non-communicable so much as the way he wrote it. When We Were Orphans is this book. It is also a story about a return to the past, about the immutability, or not, of that past. And about lost paradises. Christopher Banks, the hero, a detective in the Hercule Poirot mould, goes back to Shanghai to try to discover the whereabouts of his parents who disappeared when he was a small child. It is set in the 30s, partly in Britain and partly in Shanghai. </p> <p>I have this theory about Ishiguro's work. It is that the novels set in Japan, or partly in Japan - the first two - are the least about Japan. By this I mean the Japan of his mind, the Japan in which the past is still intact, a world he was at first nervous to penetrate - in the same way that he refrained from visiting Japan for almost 30 years. All his novels, of course, are in part about the return of the past, the denial of the past. And about the fall-out that comes from such denial. But I can read A Pale View Of The Hills, a mysterious story in which a Japanese mother looks back over her early life in post-war Nagasaki following the suicide of her eldest daughter, as a direct parable about the impossibility of escaping the past. I can read An Artist Of The Floating World as the story of a man who wants to be a good man, but who is so steeped in self-deception that nothing has permanent value in his life. Save perhaps his little grandson - whom he also misunderstands. </p> <p>But The Remains Of The Day I cannot read without thinking about Japan - in this figurative sense. The closed, private world of the aristocratic house, so perfectly comprehended by the butler Stephens and from which Stephens is so rudely ejected. The defining of Stephens's identity by his absurd attachment to this old order. Stephens's naivety, his unpreparedness, for the world outside. The impossibility of making the new world conform to his image, or of being able to address the moral issues out there. The disproportion between the individual and world history. </p> <p>Japan, then, is the safe place, it's the place that we start from, the place we long to return to even though we know that we cannot. There is no map of how to get there and, as in The Unconsoled, any such attempt will be eternally thwarted. Which reminds me of something I noticed about Tokyo - on the only occasion that I have been to Japan. House numbers are not chronological. In so far as any logic governs the numbering, it is determined by when the house was built. For example number 11 can be next to number 269. In Tokyo, even taxi-drivers do not use addresses - they are useless. In other words, you have to know precisely where you are going in order to arrive there. </p> <p>Ishiguro lives with Lorna, his Glaswegian wife and partner of 20 years, and their seven-year-old daughter Naomi in a pretty house in Golders Green - the sitting-room dominated by Naomi's toys. He obviously enjoys the idea of suburban family life. He drives a Saab that he doesn't like any more - \"too unreliable\" - and is converting the garage into an extension for the kitchen. \"No one around here uses the garage for their car. It's not done.\" And every Wednesday Ishiguro, along with all his neighbours, puts out his wheely plastic dustbin in a reassuringly regimented line. The area has a strong community feel, although, as he points out, it is a cross section of communities. There are a lot of orthodox Jews, some Americans and Australians, and quite a lot of Japanese. \"The Japanese executives tend to live in north London, though the majority only stay up until the time their children are five. Then they return home.\" </p> <p>In Naomi's nursery class, about a third of the children were Japanese. \"It is far fewer now.\" Though he speaks Japanese to his parents, \"very bad Japanese\", he doesn't intend for Naomi to learn it. \"No point.\" He says that he thinks the tightness of ethnic communities makes it very difficult for the young. \"You see, when I came to England, I had no choice to make. I was the only Japanese. There was no one to ask me which community I wanted to be a part of, so there was no conflict for me.\" Yet he also describes how quickly he had to learn basic cultural differences. The striking disparity in the way his parents treated him, \"deferentially\", and the way his friends were treated in their homes. \"Extremely rudely.\" </p> <p>Cultural differences are, of course, a dead give-away and can be difficult to appreciate. \"You have to be constantly on the look out.\" In Japan, for example, it is socially unforgivable to blow your nose in public - far worse than farting or picking your nose - though you regularly see grown men drunk and vomiting in the street, and this is regarded benevolently. \"In Finland,\" he says, quoting a musician friend of his, \"it is considered okay to shit in your pants when you are drunk. In the Finnish equivalent of the pub, there is a regular chorus of, 'Ah . . . too late.' \" </p> <p>Though he doesn't say so, perhaps he did go through a phase of a kind of conscious assimilation, an over-emphatic identification with the British. In his gap year before going to Kent University to read English and philosophy, he would regularly go to the Highlands of Scotland, where he was a grouse-beater on the Queen Mother's estate. \"North Scotland seemed like going back in time, almost feudal. Liberating, refreshing . . .\" No doubt, if you had been brought up in conservative Surrey. He doesn't remotely conceal his nostalgia. \"It was a whole way of life which perhaps has disappeared by now.\" But in this same gap year he also travelled to America, it was 1974, the Vietnam war was on-going. \"I met Vietnam vets while I was hitch-hiking around. It was my first introduction to real politics rather than student politics.\" </p> <p> Looking back, he says . . . he is always looking back as though in the constant process of reappraising the same material. Maybe it is this quality, transparently self-conscious as it is, that makes some ask: where is the feeling in Ishiguro? Clearly, what he writes is calm - but is it cold? Certainly it is ordered. Little, nothing, is accidental. \"Not in the way I write, no. I put in certain effects, it is calculated, very much something I have prepared.\" We are unused to writers, I suspect, saying as much. For painters, working with materials we see as both discrete and part of the process, we are more comfortable with this degree of calculation. We want writers to be inspirational, not illustrational. We want sensations involved not simply intelligence. Ishiguro's writing is very compact and very intelligent. He would say, before anyone else, that each reader has their own autonomy. But a great work of art is judged finally by its endurance - and, if you are a writer, by the curious way in which words and the effect of these words combine. </p> <p>Anyway, as he says, looking back: \"Though I wasn't aware of it at the time, I see now that there were two distinct groups of kids that I met in the States. Middle-class kids like me getting a romantic experience. And working-class kids, on skid row, running away.\" Nothing nostalgic here. But the use of the word romantic is interesting. It's how he had earlier described Scotland - \"its romantic associations\". </p> <p>Maybe it was to neutralise the romance that, following his first year at university, he took a sabbatical and went back to Scotland, but this time as a community worker on an estate in Renfrew, outside Glasgow. And two years later, after his degree, he went to work in London, in Ladbroke Grove, as a volunteer for an organisation that looked after the homeless. He was popular with the people he worked with. </p> <p>\"In Renfrew, they'd hated the guy before me, partly because he was English and partly because he was a prat.\" It's not surprising that he found it easy to be accepted here. The world of the underprivileged is itself, you could say, a closed society. Stranded inside it you learn fast its codes and practices. For Ishiguro, this world of the displaced, the homeless, was another analogue of his relationship to his past. </p> <p>The past. \"If I had been born 10 years earlier,\" he says at one point, \"I would have been alive when the bomb was dropped.\" What is one to make of this? A kind of groundless guilt - the worst - because it can't be eliminated by repentance or redemption. </p> <p>The first time Ishiguro recalls talking to his parents about the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki was soon after his first short stories were published in 1980. \"I remember my mother saying, 'You are in the public realm now, you have some power. There are certain memories that should not die with me.' \" The stories she told him were mostly personal anecdotes, \"of friends who died\". Memories of a teenage girl. She would have been 18 on August 9, 1945. </p> <p>Unlike Hiroshima, three days before, the bomb that fell on Nagasaki was not a direct hit. It devastated only one side of the city, killing 39,000 people- as Ishiguro says, \"a relatively small number\". His mother was one of those injured in the blast and so paradoxically, \"in her mind and therefore in my own\", she missed the bomb. Because she was hurt and resting, she was not summoned to burn the dead and to assist the injured. \"She never saw the real horror.\" It was the height of summer and imperative to burn the bodies before disease set in. His mother's father led one of the teams that worked around the clock, old and young, piling up the bodies to burn. \"No one knew anything about radiation then,\" says Ishiguro. </p> <p>It was natural, of course, that no one told the young girl what they had seen. \"My mother never had a sense of the atom bomb as a special event. There had been daily bombings going on all around her. In many ways, she remembers these as scarier.\" But she did tell him of one night when she remembered waking to hear her own mother crying out as in a nightmare, \"It's the flies. The flies won't leave the bodies.\" And how after the atom bomb everything looked all right - a bit wonky, but okay. And then it rained and the house was leaking everywhere. \"There was merely the illusion, temporary, that it wasn't that bad.\" Two years after the bomb, his grandfather died from leukemia; his mother's elder brother died of cancer 10 years ago; her sister survived breast cancer. \"Naturally, she thinks these things are related.\" Think of the containment in his stories, the occasional flatness of the narrative, and ask where is the feeling now? </p> <p>Last autumn, Ishiguro received an invitation to visit Auschwitz from the International Auschwitz Committee, set up by survivors after the war to preserve its memory and to teach future generations what had occurred there. And though he receives many invitations, and declines most of them, he decided to accept. He discovered there that the organisation had reached a crisis point: a lot of the people who had experienced the camp are very old, and a time will come when there will be no survivors to impart their memory to the young. The Auschwitz Committee had invited Ishiguro as part of its initiative to become a wider intellectual and cultural centre, to apply the experience of the past to contemporary situations such as Kosovo. They have recognised that they have got to change, Ishiguro says, or there is the danger that the memory will have no more relevance for future generations than the Napoleonic Wars do for us. \"We may remember the Holocaust, but in some superficial Guy Fawkes Night sort of way. We will forget in the profound sense. The deeper questions will be lost.\" </p> <p>As he has got older, this realisation has concerned him more. \"For me, it is a part of the ageing process. I have begun to feel the burden of remembering - the last war, the cold war. It is falling now to our generation. Even though we didn't live through it, we grew up in the shadow of it and the fears that came out of it.\" For the first time in a century, we have leaders who did not experience a war directly. \"That is a worry, because the sad fact is that we all know how easy it is to send people to war.\" And, as he says, some who will be eligible to vote in the next election probably won't remember a time before the Berlin Wall came down. \"There is a generation after us who have never known a war. It doesn't puzzle me at all that the far right in Europe can pick up votes with the young. Or that those of us in middle age are more wary.\" </p> <p>Of course, we have been lucky. \"It seems a staggering fluke that a group of us who happen to live in a little corner of Europe have escaped disasters. If you look through history this doesn't happen often.\" It reminds him, he says, of a scene in a Buster Keaton film where two huge barn doors fall down either side of him, just missing him, And he walks off blissfully unaware. \"There is a bunch of us just like that. And I don't know if this luck can hold out.\" </p> <p>Knowledge, experience, the burden of memory. How much we know, how much we tell - and, I suppose, how much we can accept - is the principal territory of his new novel, When We Were Orphans. Like all his books, it is less concerned with plot than with describing a mental process - as if, could you turn someone's head inside out, this is what it would look like. It started, he says, with two ideas - the metaphor of orphans. \"Which refers to that moment in our lives when we come out of the sheltered bubble of childhood and discover that the world is not the cosy place that we had previously been taught to believe.\" It is something that we all experience and it stays with us. \"Even when we become adults, something of this disappointment, I think, remains.\" </p> <p>There is also the idea, more structural than anything else, of detection. Ishiguro had been reading detective fiction of the 30s. \"And I was struck by how different the English novels are from the American hard-boiled tradition of an urban purgatory. The English books present an innocent world in which one thing has gone wrong. In a sleepy little Dorset village, the vicar has poisoned someone. And all that is required is for the detective to come along, go click, and everything is beautiful again. Everyone is happy, all the subplots are resolved. Everything reverts to how it once was.\" And there is something very poignant about this, he says. \"The golden age of this literature comes directly after the first world war. The people who read those books in such great numbers had experienced darkness and evil in all its modern form. They knew better than we do the uncontainable aspect of evil.\" </p> <p>It is very moving, he says, against this terrible knowledge, this desire to believe in a detective who can control evil, put it back in its box. \"I had the image of such a detective let loose in the modern world, still with the idea that he can counter evil by these methods. And how absurd it would look going round with a magnifying glass trying to stop the second world war. And the comic possibilities of that.\" </p> <p>So Christopher Banks, Ishiguro's detective, is a bit of an idiot really. He represents that naive, innocent part of all of us - the desire to put things right, without the equipment to do so. \"To go back, to fix things.\" And as we watch him blundering around, drawing all the wrong conclusions, we regard him not with scorn for his folly but with the tenderness with which we might regard a child, because we know what a rude awakening is in store for him. So Banks comes to represent that part of ourselves that we can allow ourselves to feel tenderness for. </p> <p>Much of the novel, then, is concerned with nostalgia. \"Nothing wrong with nostalgia,\" says Ish. \"It is a much-maligned emotion. The English don't like it, under-rate it, because it harks back to empire days and to guilt about the empire. But nostalgia is the emotional equivalent of idealism. You use memory to go back to a place better than the one you find yourself in. I am trying to give nostalgia a better name.\" We are nostalgic as individuals, he says, and as a society we are nostalgic for a historic past that we didn't experience. In the novel, Ishiguro directly equates the collapsing of a personal world - Banks's childhood caving in when his parents disappear - with the collapsing of the civilised world at the outbreak of the second world war. \"This longing for something better than we have doesn't really mean we believe in it.\" Any more than the readers in the 30s believed it. Maybe, then, what Ishiguro is saying is that, as an impulse, nostalgia, longing, is the best we can do. If it leads us imaginatively to create a better world. </p> <p> The idea that you can be nostalgic for something you never knew, never had, must relate in part to his feelings about Japan. He talks about Japan much more now than I remember him doing in the past. It is true, he says, that when he started to become known he was cautious about Japan. \"Because that seemed in a way to be my appeal. People seemed to think that I was some sort of Japanese foreign correspondent. I remember Channel 4 once asking me to appear to talk about the trade war between America and Japan.\" But the result of this caution \"was that people interpreted it as thinking I didn't want to talk about Japan at all. They'd be very apologetic if they brought it up. It was sort of, 'Whatever you do, don't talk about Japan.' Which is not true at all.\" </p> <p>In some ways, he says, Japan has come to seem more relevant to him. \"I was, after all, brought up by Japanese parents - to a certain extent I am accustomed to Japanese values.\" But then again, the other major influences on his life - his school, teachers, friends, his wife - he wouldn't want in any way to deny the significance of them. It is not easy, this loyalty to the past and to the present. Or, to put it another way, to the imagination and to reality. Japan remains to him \"a place I have been to only once\".

      "bodyText": "Kazuo Ishiguro was six years old in 1960 when his parents brought their small family, just Kazuo and his older sister Fumiko, from Nagasaki to live in Guildford, Surrey. It was, as Ishiguro explains, regarded very much as an adventure; the family never expected to stay long. His father, an oceanographer, was employed by the British government on a research project in the North Sea. As soon as the funding dried up, after a couple years it was anticipated, they would be back in Japan. So it happened, Ish says now, \"that I never properly said goodbye to Japan, only a temporary goodbye. For a long time, I simply assumed that we would return.\" Maybe, had they known it was forever, there would have been a more conscious holding on to Japan. Or a proper bereavement. But as things happened, \"It was just time, life, the world, that came along and rearranged things when I wasn't looking. The next time I looked, Japan was gone.\" Ten years after the family's arrival in England, Ishiguro's grandfather died in the old Nagasaki house where they had once lived together. They hadn't seen him since their departure. No one's fault, no one's choice. \"You have to realise that in those days travel wasn't as easy as it is today. It took three days to get to England from Japan.\" Most likely, Ishiguro says, he didn't appreciate at the time what a profound event in his life this death was. \"My grandfather had been my father- figure for the first four years of my life while my father was away on business.\" And his grandfather had remained his link with Japan. Every month, the old man would send him a parcel, \"big, thick\", containing the most popular children's magazine of the time, full of gifts and puzzles and the comic strip about Oba-q, a friendly family ghost - to keep Kazuo up-to-date with contemporary kids' culture, of course, so that he wouldn't feel lost among his friends when eventually he returned. In the 40 years since leaving Japan, Ishiguro has returned only once, on a brief \"author's tour\" in 1989 after the Japanese publication of his third novel, the Booker prize-winning The Remains Of The Day. Prior to this, although he had travelled extensively through Europe and America, he had deliberately avoided going back. \"Because, in my head, all these people are still alive. Against all rational knowledge, somewhere I believe that everything is running smoothly there, much the same way as it always did. The world of my childhood is still intact.\" As though to go back one would commit the crime of having them die all over again - this time in the powerful reality of the imagination. Anyway, back in 1960, the Ishiguro family settled happily into their semi-detached in Grange Close, a quiet cul-de-sac of 12 houses, which they rented from their friends, the Derbyshires, who had gone to live in South Africa. It must have been very strange for his mother Shizuko who, at 34, had never been outside Japan and who naturally spoke not a word of English. Perhaps less strange for his father, Shizuo, who had been here before. But there was no attempt, Ishiguro says, to recreate a mini-Japan in Guildford - difficult even if they had wanted to: \"This was long before you could buy sushi in the supermarket.\" It was a time when there were so few Japanese in Britain that on New Year's Day the ambassador would invite every Japanese present in the country to the embassy for a celebratory drink. \"And I don't think it was full,\" Ish says. His parents' attitude was: \"We are only here for a short time, so get into it.\" As he recalls, it was a quintessentially English house - \"fireplace and desk\" in the sitting room, though there were samurai scabbards on the mantelpiece. His mother socialised with all the neighbours. \"I remember with some surprise how kind everyone was to us, even strangers, and I think that was partly the way we looked - very sweet, doll-like. And partly that this was pre-Powell, and there weren't any ready-made views about foreigners.\" There was little simple stereotyping - the only vaguely unpleasant incident he recalls was the discovery that one of their neighbours had been in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. \"I looked at him slightly differently after that.\" But most of the experiences were more comic than anything else. For example, the Evanses, a family of religious zealots who lived across the street, would turn up every day \"to help out\" and to explain things to Mrs Ishiguro. \"I don't know what my mother really thought of them - she is far too nice ever to say anything against anyone.\" And as far as the Ishiguros knew, this was the way all Christians behaved. \"They were all the same to us.\" It was only years later, he says, that they discovered the Evanses' reputation. \"And that we were sitting targets, real mugs.\" Still, the family obviously felt at home there and must have liked it, because his parents live there still. Not in the same house. When, after some years, the Derbyshires returned from abroad, Mr and Mrs Ishiguro decided that rather than continue to rent they would like to buy. As luck would have it, at exactly that moment, the semi adjacent to the one they were renting came up for sale and they moved next door. What is odd, Ish says, is that the houses are exactly the same - \"furnished the same, even the view out of the window is the same\" - and yet fundamentally different: they are a mirror image of each other. \"Which is very confusing when I visit my parents. Because in my head, in the house I remember from my childhood, everything is always the other way round.\" It is a neat image, the two houses, joined and yet facing away from each other. A kind of dual inheritance that almost replicates Ishiguro's own experience. East and west; assimilated and displaced; reality and imagination; perception and projection. As he says himself, it is not easy to disentangle any of these couplings. But as a metaphor it is also schematic in just the right proportions. For Ishiguro, along with Kafka, is the great bureaucratic fabulist of anxiety. Anxiety is his imaginative architecture, and it is an anxiety that he imparts to his reader. It is one of the features of Ishiguro's writing that you can never work out which side he is on. Which house does he inhabit? The real one or the one in his mind? And, anyway, which one for him is the more real? The last time I met Ishiguro was just over four years ago, following the paperback publication of his fourth novel, The Unconsoled. At the time, he was bemused that the book had not received the unanimous praise of the first three novels. \"Not everyone came along for the ride.\" I remember he could quote some of the reviews. \"It invents its own category of badness,\" James Wood had written in this paper. And the Observer had put a photo of him on its front page with the caption: Is he bonkers? \"Or some such thing.\" Set in a nameless central European city, the book focused on the return of the celebrated pianist Mr Ryder to the town where he is scheduled to give a concert that never materialises. To some, it seemed inconceivable that the same sensibility that had written with such delicacy and refinement in An Artist Of The Floating World, A Pale View Of The Hills, The Remains Of The Day could write something so amorphous and inaccessible. The book is 600 pages of plotless, circular, sustained hallucination, and many of his readers just couldn't decode it. It may as well have been written - frankly - in Japanese. This sounds like a facile observation; but there may be something to it. Ishiguro is a communicator - he doesn't like obscurity in any form. If something about this book was incomprehensible to his audience, he decided, he would write it again and in a different way. In other words, he was convinced that it was not the experience that was non-communicable so much as the way he wrote it. When We Were Orphans is this book. It is also a story about a return to the past, about the immutability, or not, of that past. And about lost paradises. Christopher Banks, the hero, a detective in the Hercule Poirot mould, goes back to Shanghai to try to discover the whereabouts of his parents who disappeared when he was a small child. It is set in the 30s, partly in Britain and partly in Shanghai. I have this theory about Ishiguro's work. It is that the novels set in Japan, or partly in Japan - the first two - are the least about Japan. By this I mean the Japan of his mind, the Japan in which the past is still intact, a world he was at first nervous to penetrate - in the same way that he refrained from visiting Japan for almost 30 years. All his novels, of course, are in part about the return of the past, the denial of the past. And about the fall-out that comes from such denial. But I can read A Pale View Of The Hills, a mysterious story in which a Japanese mother looks back over her early life in post-war Nagasaki following the suicide of her eldest daughter, as a direct parable about the impossibility of escaping the past. I can read An Artist Of The Floating World as the story of a man who wants to be a good man, but who is so steeped in self-deception that nothing has permanent value in his life. Save perhaps his little grandson - whom he also misunderstands. But The Remains Of The Day I cannot read without thinking about Japan - in this figurative sense. The closed, private world of the aristocratic house, so perfectly comprehended by the butler Stephens and from which Stephens is so rudely ejected. The defining of Stephens's identity by his absurd attachment to this old order. Stephens's naivety, his unpreparedness, for the world outside. The impossibility of making the new world conform to his image, or of being able to address the moral issues out there. The disproportion between the individual and world history. Japan, then, is the safe place, it's the place that we start from, the place we long to return to even though we know that we cannot. There is no map of how to get there and, as in The Unconsoled, any such attempt will be eternally thwarted. Which reminds me of something I noticed about Tokyo - on the only occasion that I have been to Japan. House numbers are not chronological. In so far as any logic governs the numbering, it is determined by when the house was built. For example number 11 can be next to number 269. In Tokyo, even taxi-drivers do not use addresses - they are useless. In other words, you have to know precisely where you are going in order to arrive there. Ishiguro lives with Lorna, his Glaswegian wife and partner of 20 years, and their seven-year-old daughter Naomi in a pretty house in Golders Green - the sitting-room dominated by Naomi's toys. He obviously enjoys the idea of suburban family life. He drives a Saab that he doesn't like any more - \"too unreliable\" - and is converting the garage into an extension for the kitchen. \"No one around here uses the garage for their car. It's not done.\" And every Wednesday Ishiguro, along with all his neighbours, puts out his wheely plastic dustbin in a reassuringly regimented line. The area has a strong community feel, although, as he points out, it is a cross section of communities. There are a lot of orthodox Jews, some Americans and Australians, and quite a lot of Japanese. \"The Japanese executives tend to live in north London, though the majority only stay up until the time their children are five. Then they return home.\" In Naomi's nursery class, about a third of the children were Japanese. \"It is far fewer now.\" Though he speaks Japanese to his parents, \"very bad Japanese\", he doesn't intend for Naomi to learn it. \"No point.\" He says that he thinks the tightness of ethnic communities makes it very difficult for the young. \"You see, when I came to England, I had no choice to make. I was the only Japanese. There was no one to ask me which community I wanted to be a part of, so there was no conflict for me.\" Yet he also describes how quickly he had to learn basic cultural differences. The striking disparity in the way his parents treated him, \"deferentially\", and the way his friends were treated in their homes. \"Extremely rudely.\" Cultural differences are, of course, a dead give-away and can be difficult to appreciate. \"You have to be constantly on the look out.\" In Japan, for example, it is socially unforgivable to blow your nose in public - far worse than farting or picking your nose - though you regularly see grown men drunk and vomiting in the street, and this is regarded benevolently. \"In Finland,\" he says, quoting a musician friend of his, \"it is considered okay to shit in your pants when you are drunk. In the Finnish equivalent of the pub, there is a regular chorus of, 'Ah . . . too late.' \" Though he doesn't say so, perhaps he did go through a phase of a kind of conscious assimilation, an over-emphatic identification with the British. In his gap year before going to Kent University to read English and philosophy, he would regularly go to the Highlands of Scotland, where he was a grouse-beater on the Queen Mother's estate. \"North Scotland seemed like going back in time, almost feudal. Liberating, refreshing . . .\" No doubt, if you had been brought up in conservative Surrey. He doesn't remotely conceal his nostalgia. \"It was a whole way of life which perhaps has disappeared by now.\" But in this same gap year he also travelled to America, it was 1974, the Vietnam war was on-going. \"I met Vietnam vets while I was hitch-hiking around. It was my first introduction to real politics rather than student politics.\" Looking back, he says . . . he is always looking back as though in the constant process of reappraising the same material. Maybe it is this quality, transparently self-conscious as it is, that makes some ask: where is the feeling in Ishiguro? Clearly, what he writes is calm - but is it cold? Certainly it is ordered. Little, nothing, is accidental. \"Not in the way I write, no. I put in certain effects, it is calculated, very much something I have prepared.\" We are unused to writers, I suspect, saying as much. For painters, working with materials we see as both discrete and part of the process, we are more comfortable with this degree of calculation. We want writers to be inspirational, not illustrational. We want sensations involved not simply intelligence. Ishiguro's writing is very compact and very intelligent. He would say, before anyone else, that each reader has their own autonomy. But a great work of art is judged finally by its endurance - and, if you are a writer, by the curious way in which words and the effect of these words combine. Anyway, as he says, looking back: \"Though I wasn't aware of it at the time, I see now that there were two distinct groups of kids that I met in the States. Middle-class kids like me getting a romantic experience. And working-class kids, on skid row, running away.\" Nothing nostalgic here. But the use of the word romantic is interesting. It's how he had earlier described Scotland - \"its romantic associations\". Maybe it was to neutralise the romance that, following his first year at university, he took a sabbatical and went back to Scotland, but this time as a community worker on an estate in Renfrew, outside Glasgow. And two years later, after his degree, he went to work in London, in Ladbroke Grove, as a volunteer for an organisation that looked after the homeless. He was popular with the people he worked with. \"In Renfrew, they'd hated the guy before me, partly because he was English and partly because he was a prat.\" It's not surprising that he found it easy to be accepted here. The world of the underprivileged is itself, you could say, a closed society. Stranded inside it you learn fast its codes and practices. For Ishiguro, this world of the displaced, the homeless, was another analogue of his relationship to his past. The past. \"If I had been born 10 years earlier,\" he says at one point, \"I would have been alive when the bomb was dropped.\" What is one to make of this? A kind of groundless guilt - the worst - because it can't be eliminated by repentance or redemption. The first time Ishiguro recalls talking to his parents about the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki was soon after his first short stories were published in 1980. \"I remember my mother saying, 'You are in the public realm now, you have some power. There are certain memories that should not die with me.' \" The stories she told him were mostly personal anecdotes, \"of friends who died\". Memories of a teenage girl. She would have been 18 on August 9, 1945. Unlike Hiroshima, three days before, the bomb that fell on Nagasaki was not a direct hit. It devastated only one side of the city, killing 39,000 people- as Ishiguro says, \"a relatively small number\". His mother was one of those injured in the blast and so paradoxically, \"in her mind and therefore in my own\", she missed the bomb. Because she was hurt and resting, she was not summoned to burn the dead and to assist the injured. \"She never saw the real horror.\" It was the height of summer and imperative to burn the bodies before disease set in. His mother's father led one of the teams that worked around the clock, old and young, piling up the bodies to burn. \"No one knew anything about radiation then,\" says Ishiguro. It was natural, of course, that no one told the young girl what they had seen. \"My mother never had a sense of the atom bomb as a special event. There had been daily bombings going on all around her. In many ways, she remembers these as scarier.\" But she did tell him of one night when she remembered waking to hear her own mother crying out as in a nightmare, \"It's the flies. The flies won't leave the bodies.\" And how after the atom bomb everything looked all right - a bit wonky, but okay. And then it rained and the house was leaking everywhere. \"There was merely the illusion, temporary, that it wasn't that bad.\" Two years after the bomb, his grandfather died from leukemia; his mother's elder brother died of cancer 10 years ago; her sister survived breast cancer. \"Naturally, she thinks these things are related.\" Think of the containment in his stories, the occasional flatness of the narrative, and ask where is the feeling now? Last autumn, Ishiguro received an invitation to visit Auschwitz from the International Auschwitz Committee, set up by survivors after the war to preserve its memory and to teach future generations what had occurred there. And though he receives many invitations, and declines most of them, he decided to accept. He discovered there that the organisation had reached a crisis point: a lot of the people who had experienced the camp are very old, and a time will come when there will be no survivors to impart their memory to the young. The Auschwitz Committee had invited Ishiguro as part of its initiative to become a wider intellectual and cultural centre, to apply the experience of the past to contemporary situations such as Kosovo. They have recognised that they have got to change, Ishiguro says, or there is the danger that the memory will have no more relevance for future generations than the Napoleonic Wars do for us. \"We may remember the Holocaust, but in some superficial Guy Fawkes Night sort of way. We will forget in the profound sense. The deeper questions will be lost.\" As he has got older, this realisation has concerned him more. \"For me, it is a part of the ageing process. I have begun to feel the burden of remembering - the last war, the cold war. It is falling now to our generation. Even though we didn't live through it, we grew up in the shadow of it and the fears that came out of it.\" For the first time in a century, we have leaders who did not experience a war directly. \"That is a worry, because the sad fact is that we all know how easy it is to send people to war.\" And, as he says, some who will be eligible to vote in the next election probably won't remember a time before the Berlin Wall came down. \"There is a generation after us who have never known a war. It doesn't puzzle me at all that the far right in Europe can pick up votes with the young. Or that those of us in middle age are more wary.\" Of course, we have been lucky. \"It seems a staggering fluke that a group of us who happen to live in a little corner of Europe have escaped disasters. If you look through history this doesn't happen often.\" It reminds him, he says, of a scene in a Buster Keaton film where two huge barn doors fall down either side of him, just missing him, And he walks off blissfully unaware. \"There is a bunch of us just like that. And I don't know if this luck can hold out.\" Knowledge, experience, the burden of memory. How much we know, how much we tell - and, I suppose, how much we can accept - is the principal territory of his new novel, When We Were Orphans. Like all his books, it is less concerned with plot than with describing a mental process - as if, could you turn someone's head inside out, this is what it would look like. It started, he says, with two ideas - the metaphor of orphans. \"Which refers to that moment in our lives when we come out of the sheltered bubble of childhood and discover that the world is not the cosy place that we had previously been taught to believe.\" It is something that we all experience and it stays with us. \"Even when we become adults, something of this disappointment, I think, remains.\" There is also the idea, more structural than anything else, of detection.

And how absurd it would look going round with a magnifying glass trying to stop the second world war. And the comic possibilities of that.\" So Christopher Banks, Ishiguro's detective, is a bit of an idiot really. He represents that naive, innocent part of all of us - the desire to put things right, without the equipment to do so. \"To go back, to fix things.\" And as we watch him blundering around, drawing all the wrong conclusions, we regard him not with scorn for his folly but with the tenderness with which we might regard a child, because we know what a rude awakening is in store for him.

But on a blazing day in late September, this earthly Paradise was dotted with only four drowsy young Germans and a family of Mum, Granny and four scampering kids from Bonifacio. </p> <p>Their incredible town, cantilevered out on its eroded limestone prows, gleamed three miles away, the rock striped with grey and honey as though Hornblower had beached a couple of frigates for a spot of whitewashing. Slithering down through the maquis in my suit trousers and sweat-drenched shirt (it was an afternoon off from a conference), I was already glutted with beauty. Not just Bonifacio, but a curtain-raiser to The Beach in the form of a narrow, deserted defile to the previous inlet, through junipers and past abandoned Genoan cannon embrasures. </p> <p>There was no sand there, and swimming in the water, whose clarity above the limestone pebbles turned the blue sky into turquoise and lapis lazuli, was a nervy affair, with the swell heaving up against the lip of the rocks and sea urchins waiting if you misjudged your footing. Pertusato has the bonus of a soft fringe of white sand, along with an almost-islet where the rock has been shifted on its side by some crunch of tectonic plates, leaving a scrabbly path to the top where you perch above a precipice and incredulously take in the view. </p> <p>It is, to be practical, mainly a view. There are no tavernas here, little shade and the Bonifacio family kindly warned me that what looked like two sandwich bags flopping on the ripples were jellyfish with lazily-drifting stings. The walk to Pertusato is long and hot and most normal children under 10 would probably arrive in tears. But The Beach is a place, like Alex Garland's invention in Thailand, which will stay in your imagination. </p> <p>Its more practical counterpart in Bonifacio itself is a tiny pair of sandy crescents down a zig-zag of cliff steps, where another scramble takes you to an unforgettable ledge, just above the waves in calm weather and far below the overhanging rim of the town. This is a very dangerous walk in rough seas, and an Italian family was swept off and drowned two years ago. But worn iron stanchions and bits of safety cable show you the way in normal conditions, along with a ghostly flight of rock steps and a squeeze between limestone layers so tight that you have to crouch to avoid clocking your head. </p> <p>The adventure ends at the celebrated King of Aragon's Steps, another giddy ladder up the cliffs, but one with an unclimbable spiked gate at the bottom and a tourist entry charge at the only official entrance, in the Old Town at the top. This makes the descent a little tamer, but is well worth paying for another, disbelieving view of 16th-century houses on their white and caramel rock shelves which one day will collapse into the sea. </p> <p>There is no way up to the Old Town and citadel of Bonifacio that fails to astonish, whether you take the polished setts of the military ramp which lead through a dark barbican with double portcullises, or the steep flights of stairs - le chemin de ronde - inside the hollow defensive walls. Closing two gates would seal the entire place off, and did through epic sieges in 1420 and 1553. There are still strong distinctions between Old Towners, with their dialect, dress and other unbroken links to the Genoan garrison which survived so perilously here, and the people of the Port below, whose ancestry is more purely Corsican. </p> <p>The Port is standard Mediterranean perfection, with harbour caf\u00e9s, yachts bobbing in the wake of the Sardinia ferry and the citadel rising grandly behind like its counterparts at Calvi in the North or Corte, the old island capital in the mountains. But the Old Town is the more exciting place to stay, either at one of three modest hotels - Le Royal, Genovese and Santa Teresa - or a chambre \u00e0 louer in the stone tenaments which interconnect and tower above the network of narrow streets so steeply that the first floor, in many cases, is reached by a ladder. </p> <p>Squeezed into the narrow space between the fortress walls (although carefully leaving room for a boules piste), the Genoans could only build upwards. Their tower blocks - ornamented with delicate coats of arms and carved window lintels - reach eight, nine and even 10 storeys high. The 16th-century Corsican shepherds must have viewed the place as we do Manhattan. </p> <p>The best guide to Corsica, Dorothy Carrington's Granite Island, credits Bonifacio with a \"supernormal intensity in every arch, campanile, doorway or moulding\", outshining the finer architecture of more famous cities because of its context of a hostile wilderness. That is still very much there in the lethal channel between the town and Sardinia (only eight miles away) and the rock-strewn maquis leading up to the needle-shaped mountains of Bavella. </p> <p>But the town also, miraculously, has an undiscovered and in places almost neglected air, familiar to me from a magical period as a reporter in Bath in the early 1970s, just before everything was sand-blasted, English Heritaged and quadrupled in price. Partly because of the recent withdrawal of the Foreign Legion, Bonifacio's Old Town has unexpected, ghostly sections prowled by cats and windy stretches of fennel and rosemary clinging to recent ruins. </p> <p>After a happy siesta in several caf\u00e9s and a desultory exploration of the sites (St Helena's fragment of the True Cross in the lovely church of St Dominic and the neighbouring houses where Charles V and Napoleon stayed) I strayed into one of these wildernesses, the cemetery on the tip of the headland where Sardinia's mountains rise dreamily out of the seahaze. Here, the old Genoan families and their descendants sleep in little miniature mansions, vividly painted in a way that suggests an admirable belief that the next life is going to be good fun. </p> <p>Notices appealed for quiet, vainly in my case thanks to an unwise souvenir - a little carved box with two wax-paper birds inside which tweeted when you opened the lid. En route to the cemetery, they had started chirruping and no amount of shaking and clenching would shut them up. </p> <p>\"It is the light which activates them, M'sieur,\" the young woman back in the shop explained, amid giggles as we unwrapped the muffled tweets from more of my plastic bags. The light is another wonder of this lovely town and its necklace of beaches; and in the end it took three plastic bags, a green dustbin liner and a swatch of embroidered ebony cloth, compliments of the Madamoiselle, to silence the irrepressible birds.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Outsiders are a recurrent theme in this year's shortlist for the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize. That does not mean the books are gloomy, but that they all reflect an understanding that conventional family relationships have been replaced in children's lives by broader and more complex structures. </p> <p>Nowhere is this more sharply observed than in The Illustrated Mum by Jacqueline Wilson, the winner of this year's prize. Told in a genuinely child-like first-person narrative by Dol, the younger daughter of the multiply tattooed Marigold - hence the book's title - it is a searingly moving story of how two girls cope with looking after their manic-depressive mother.</p> <p>They have done so through a make-believe that has gilded her foibles, allowing them to feel that she is special rather than mad. But Star, Dol's clever half sister, now longs for conformity - and, above all, an end to caring and coping. Escaping briefly with her father, she leaves Dol to manage the make-believe alone. The results are disastrous and force the girls to get help. There are no easy answers, but Wilson offers an ending that gives them some security and support. </p> <p>The outline sounds impossibly bleak, but the warmth between the sisters, as well as their deep love for their mother and hers for them, provides emotional sustenance. \"I wanted to get across the fact that though Marigold is technically a bad mother, she still loves her girls. She is a warm person, but irresponsible,\" says Wilson. </p> <p>She has been writing in this vein for the last decade and, along with Anne Fine, Robert Swindells and Melvin Burgess, has led the current fashion for social realism in children's books. The realism comes not from contemporary touchstones but from an awareness of the way life is for many children. Wilson says: \"The tradition in children's books used to be that there was a beginning, a middle and an ending and the ending was the happy bit. Now, real life isn't like that for most children. I try and end positively, but not necessarily happily. Things are usually slightly better in fiction than in the real world.\" </p> <p>Adapting the traditions of children's books in this way has certainly proved very popular with children. Wilson's sackfuls of letters from fans reveal how much she has struck home with titles such as The Suitcase Kid, Tracy Beaker, The Bed and Breakfast Star and Bad Girls. Her house is full of pictures of her \"girls\" and even dolls modelled on her characters, all sent by young people who read her books and see themselves. </p> <p>Wilson's philosophy of writing was to create the books she would have liked as a child, but couldn't find. \"The nearest I got was Eve Garnett's The Family From One End Street. Instead, I read adult books about children, like Catherine Cookson's books about Mary Ann, whose parents drank, and Rumer Godden's A Greengage Summer. When I was 13 I was given Cookson's The Devil and Mary Ann, and at the same time I discovered Lolita, which made me see how you tell a story.\" </p> <p>Her blend of serious subject matter and jaunty first-person narrative makes her accessible to a wide range of readers, who appreciate her humour and affectionate observation of children just like them. \"I've always tried very hard to give children an easy read - a good read - so that they'll think 'I liked that', and read some more. Writing in the first person helps make the books seem easy, but I mostly use it because it attracted me as a reader in books like The Bell Jar and The Catcher in the Rye, my two favourite modern novels. It's also easier to get a child's point of view across. Writing in the third person is very distancing. I don't want to give a rounded point of view: I want to give the children's view of what is happening.\" </p> <p>In The Illustrated Mum, Dol observes the gradual disintegration of Marigold into madness in terms of the tattoos she gets to mark out each new phase of her life. Dol's inexperienced and optimistic view of her mother speaks straight to children, making her problems seem strange and unpredictable rather than scary.</p> <p>Wilson's own interest in manic depression was triggered by her admiration for Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf, but she admits that putting it into a children's book was entering new and more difficult territory. \"The Illustrated Mum is a blacker book than any I've written before, and dealing with Marigold's mood swings became very scary. But you can't have a laugh a minute. Adults find it more upsetting than children; soaps have given them an appetite for drama and, from them, they are used to huge emotional extremes. Eastenders, Brookside and The Simpsons are all stories with lots of domestic detail and real social problems - these influence what children read. Kids are now very much part of adult society: they know about anorexia and sex and drugs, they've observed all sorts of things on TV. This is their world.\" </p> <p>Wilson's empathy with children has given her the unusual distinction of popularity without the mediation of parents or teachers. Although she deals with what might be thought of as \"issues\", she never preaches, believing that the morals of society are not always the same as children's inner moral code. \"I don't like telling people what to do. I'm generally writing as a child and children don't tell each other what to do. If there's any preaching in my books it's saying 'OK, be what you are. You don't have to be like anyone else or do what anyone else wants. You have to try and like yourself.' \"</p>",

      "body": "<p>By the time you read this the Guardian's style guide should have made its long-awaited appearance on our website. The address is given below, and so is an email address for your comments, criticisms, suggestions. We are sorry that we cannot publish the guide in any other form at present but that need not (indeed, I am sure it will not) prevent those of you who do not have access to it from commenting on matters of style arising from your reading of the paper. There is an address below for your letters, too. </p> <p>The new guide, to an unusual degree, already embodies suggestions made by readers and it is the paper's intention to keep this dialogue going. Indeed, I think it would now be quite difficult to stop it. The policy for the capitalisation of nouns, as I said last week, has been substantially amended in response to your comments. A cynic might say that we did something daft, there were howls of protest from readers and we were forced to backtrack. A harsh view. There are plenty of entries in the style guide which support the more accurate contention that input by readers is genuinely listened to and valued. </p> <p>The editor's guidelines on swearwords directly acknowledged the concern of many readers and are now succinctly expressed in the style guide, saying, in part, \"First, remember the reader and respect demands that we should not casually use words that are likely to offend... There is almost never a case in which we need to use a swearword outside direct quotes.\" </p> <p>We may - in a perverse frame of mind - argue about whether some of the entries, which seem to restrict or restrain us in the language we use when dealing with, for example, race, gender, illness and disability, embody or conflict with the liberal principles that the paper professes.

      "bodyText": "By the time you read this the Guardian's style guide should have made its long-awaited appearance on our website. The address is given below, and so is an email address for your comments, criticisms, suggestions. We are sorry that we cannot publish the guide in any other form at present but that need not (indeed, I am sure it will not) prevent those of you who do not have access to it from commenting on matters of style arising from your reading of the paper. There is an address below for your letters, too. The new guide, to an unusual degree, already embodies suggestions made by readers and it is the paper's intention to keep this dialogue going. Indeed, I think it would now be quite difficult to stop it. The policy for the capitalisation of nouns, as I said last week, has been substantially amended in response to your comments. A cynic might say that we did something daft, there were howls of protest from readers and we were forced to backtrack. A harsh view. There are plenty of entries in the style guide which support the more accurate contention that input by readers is genuinely listened to and valued. The editor's guidelines on swearwords directly acknowledged the concern of many readers and are now succinctly expressed in the style guide, saying, in part, \"First, remember the reader and respect demands that we should not casually use words that are likely to offend... There is almost never a case in which we need to use a swearword outside direct quotes.\" We may - in a perverse frame of mind - argue about whether some of the entries, which seem to restrict or restrain us in the language we use when dealing with, for example, race, gender, illness and disability, embody or conflict with the liberal principles that the paper professes. But in these areas the style guide is not restricting us in what we say at all. The guide is telling us or seeking to persuade us to use language that is more civilised because it acknowledges the point of view of the person or people to whom it is applied. This is part of the reason why we spell Gypsy with a capital G (recent examples suggesting the contrary have been lapses). It is also why we do not refer to \"the disabled\", a term which seems to strip disabled people of their broader identity; we ban the use of the term schizophrenic outside its medical context since its loose use offends those who know the ordeal of the real condition; we prefer to talk of the hidden economy rather than the black economy; we would like to call all those who tread the boards, whether male or female, actors and we would rather not call them \"luvvies\" (\"a silly cliche: do not use\"). The guide makes a brave attempt to focus our use of the term \"ethnic\" which we employ too frequently in a way which seems to convey the viewpoint of a white person making only a token or provisional nod to multi-culturalism. The guide says, among other things, \"Do not use 'ethnic' to mean black or Asian people.\" The guide wisely points out, \"Our use of language should reflect not only changes in society but the newspaper's values.\" I hope you will feel that it does. The intention is to use language that suggests an inclusive society rather than a club from which large numbers of readers, readers who expect to find in the Guardian a sympathetic environment, feel excluded.

      "bodyText": "The future of the Northern Ireland peace process could be thrown into jeopardy because of the narrow margin by which David Trimble held on to the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party today. Mr Trimble defeated South Belfast MP the Rev Martin Smyth by 457 to 348 votes, 56% to 43%, in a crunch secret ballot of the party's ruling council in the King's Hall, Belfast. This evening, in a second setback to Mr Trimble's leadership, his party demanded that any attempt to reactivate the power-sharing executive should be linked to the retention of the name and symbols of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Trimble ally Michael McGimpsey claimed the ballot result was a \"rock solid majority\" for the Upper Bann MP, but Mr Smyth said the leader would now have to consider his position. \"He may have to make his decision very shortly as to what he is going to do,\" said Mr Smyth. \"Mr Trimble must tell us how he is going to unify not only the [Ulster Unionist] Council but the party and the country and beyond that the unionist voters who have been deserting our party in droves.\" The Trimble camp may have survived a closer than expected battle with the anti-Good Friday agreement wing of the deeply divided party, but the skirmish could do irreparable harm to both unionism and the peace process. Mr Smyth emerged as a challenger when hardliners' hackles were raised by the apparent flexibility towards republicans shown in remarks by Mr Trimble on a recent visit to Washington. He said he was willing to re-enter a power-sharing Stormont executive with Sinn Fein without prior IRA decommissioning, provided there was a guarantee on arms down the line. The hardliners want a weapons handover before they would consider an inclusive government with republicans. The British and Irish governments are desperate to jump-start negotiations to try to get the suspended political institutions up and running again in the next couple of months. But the narrow nature of Mr Trimble's victory today has undoubtedly left him weakened and will give him little room for manoeuvre in any future discussions with Sinn Fein. Some unionist sources believe another leadership contender could come forward within weeks. This could be Lagan Valley MP Jeffrey Donaldson, an articulate and outspoken critic of the Good Friday accord. Should Mr Donaldson be elected to the top post, the task of trying to reach a deal with republicans could slip beyond reach for the time being. Mr Trimble's second setback of the day came when rank and file delegates of the Ulster Unionist Council backed the pro-RUC motion by London-based businessman David Burnside by 384 votes to 338. Mr Trimble said the result demonstrated \"the depths of the concern and the passionate feeling\" about the government's plans to reform policing in Northern Ireland. However, he insisted that he was not \"shattered and I do not think that I am shackled\" by the acceptance of the motion. He said that unionists had felt, since the signing of the Good Friday agreement almost two years ago, that their interests were being ignored and he claimed the Patten report on policing in Northern Ireland had served as a \"constant gnawing reminder\" of that fact.",

      "bodyText": "The boyfriend of international athlete Ashia Hansen was taken into hiding yesterday on leaving hospital after a gang of at least four racists stabbed him in the back and slashed him across the forehead. Chris Cotter, 28, was told by one of his attackers: \"We warned you not to mix with niggers.\" Detectives confirmed that Ms Hansen, a triple-jumper with a good chance of a gold medal in the Olympic Games in Sydney this summer, later received a hate-mail letter which read: \"You were lucky last time. We won't make the same mistake again.\" The couple told officers they were going to leave their homes in Birmingham because they feared further attacks. West Midlands police do not believe the attack on Mr Cotter was by a known racist group, but Searchlight, the anti-fascist magazine, warned there had been a surge in activity by far right organisations in the Midlands. \"To these kind of people, a white man going out with a black woman is the ultimate betrayal,\" said its publisher, Gerry Gable. The attack, on Tuesday, is not the first against mixed-race couples with a high profile. Sharron Davies, a former Olympic medalist, and her then husband, Derek Redmond, were sent obscene and abusive letters by members of the extremist group Combat 18, when they married in 1994. Three years ago a letter bomb concealed in a video cassette was sent to their house. Frank Bruno, the former world heavyweight boxing champion, and his wife, Laura, have also been victims of racist threats. Mr Cotter, a former long-jumper who retired after injury and now works in insurance, was attacked at 10.25pm when he visited Ms Hansen at her home in Erdington. As he got out of his car, he was approached by a man in a dark duffle coat and a black woollen hat who made racist remarks, grabbed his arm, and punched him in the back. Moments later, he was joined by several other men who continued the assault. Mr Cotter told police: \"They were swearing at me, calling me a nigger lover. It was only when I saw the blood that I realised I had been stabbed.\" Ms Hansen looked out to see her boyfriend stumbling up the path to her front door and the men driving off in a blue Ford Sierra. \"There was blood everywhere,\" she told officers. \"It was horrific.\" Mr Cotter had three wounds in his back and lost four pints of blood, and had to have 17 stitches in his forehead. When Ms Hansen returned home the next day accompanied by detectives she found the hate letter, pasted together with an alphabet cut from newspapers. Ms Hansen told police she has been harrassed before, and that Mr Cotter had received a threatening phone call last weekend. Superintendent Tony Garbett, leading the investigation with a team of 12, said yesterday: \"[It] was a nasty attack and it was specific to Mr Cotter. These injuries are not life threatening, but with any knife attack the difference between life and death is very small. \"We have no doubt it was racially motivated because of the connection between him and Ashia Hansen.\" He added that he was unsure whether the attack was part of a campaign: \"We need to know, was he followed, were they lying in wait, and, if they were, how did they know he would be there at that time at that place?\" Although the police suspect the stabbing was a one-off, a local campaign group said there had been 200 racial attacks in Birmingham since last June. \"That is a significant rise on figures for the year before,\" said Maxi Hayles, of Birmingham Racist Attacks Monitoring Unit. \"There is a problem here which the police cannot ignore. We cannot tolerate this type of behaviour. Many of the incidents we have been told about have been attacks in the street. These are sinister times, and we need to lock these thugs up as quickly as possible.\" Mr Cotter and Ms Hansen, world indoor record holder for the triple jump, met when they were training partners and have been together six years. She is due to leave the country shortly to prepare for the Olympics. In Plymouth, Mr Cotter's father, Joe Cotter, 65, said: \"We talked to him yesterday in hospital and he said he was okay, but from what we read later it was more horrific than he told us.\" Victims of race hatred In 1996 swimmer Sharron Davies and her then husband, black former athlete Derek Redmond , were sent an explosive device hidden in a video cassette but it was intercepted and defused.

Publisher Mark Atkinson was jailed for 21 months in 1997 for publishing the magazine which gave details of Bruno's mother.

His wife Monika , who is white, has also spoken of the problems of racism but has said the most acute problems were in her native country, Germany In 1996 Boris Becker, the German tennis player, whose wife Barbara is black, received a series of racist threats which he said would force him to leave the country.

In this week's debate, Exeter University professor of education Ted Wragg takes on Sheila Lawlor of the Politeia social policy institute.

      "body": "<b>Dear Ted,</b> <br> Gordon Brown has promised to pay allowances worth up to \u00a340 per week to young people to stay on at school after 16. The move is a bad one for three main reasons. <p>First, it involves means testing. By reinventing means testing for selected benefits, Brown is going against the culture of this country, where means tests arouse antipathy because they encourage dependency and lead to intrusion into the lives of ordinary people. Moreover, selectively applied hand-outs, whether in education or social security, open the way for all kinds of fraud: people \"play the system\" and the state has to step in with elaborate checking machinery.</p> <p>Second, these allowances will be given to young people purely on the basis of what their parents earn (or say they earn). Young people are being judged and favoured because their parents declare they cannot pay for them to remain in school. But what of those young people whose parents will not pay? Would it not be better to establish a sensible loans system (extending and improving that available for higher education), where repayment is linked to earning in later life with a low (or no) interest rate, open to all?</p> <p>Third, there is no evidence that state bribes, such as these allowances, will do much to affect the pattern of life of those who take advantage of them. They may stay at school, but will they learn much? Instead of pursuing the paths followed by so many other countries which allow for differences in aptitude and ability, education in England and Wales has been systematically designed to promote mediocre uniformity. Skewing the system further by paying people to stay on who may not otherwise will lead yet further in this direction.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Sheila Lawlor<br> Politeia social policy institute</p> <p><b>Dear Sheila,</b><br> I'm strongly in favour of giving financial support to young people who might not otherwise be able to study further. Education is a liberation from dependency, not a recipe for it. I disagree with all three of your objections.</p> <p>First, what is wrong with checking out need through means testing? The alternatives are either no support at all, or giving the same amount to everyone, pauper or billionaire. This is what happened with nursery vouchers, an indiscriminate hand-out which subsidised wealthy people patronising expensive private establishments. Public funds are not limitless, so they should be concentrated on the needy. You also suggest there would be fraud. Why do you assume greater fraud from the poor than among rich tax fiddlers?</p> <p>There is more suspicion of fiddling in your second point (\"or say they earn\"). A further two years of loans, added to at least three years of them in higher education, would saddle young people with an even greater debt. If education eventually does bring financial bounties, then the recipient will in any case be paying more back to society in taxes.</p> <p>Your third point is equally demeaning of the poor. This is revealed in the emotive language you use: \"bribes\", \"will they learn much?\", \"mediocre uniformity\", as if the less well off invariably drag down the rest. I do not share this view of an unwashed peasantry, likely to spoil a nice party if allowed through the door.</p> <p>Education is far too important to be the exclusive domain of the few. The entry fee to our rapidly changing society, where the unskilled and under-educated are increasingly vulnerable, has gone up. A humane and far-sighted society offers all children the chance to acquire the knowledge and skills that they will need.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Ted Wragg<br> Professor of education,<br> University of Exeter</p> <p><b>Dear Ted,</b><br> There's a strong case to be made against means testing. Beveridge rejected it, and economists now recognise that means tests create dependency traps, so that the people on the lowest incomes pay high marginal rates of tax. Fraud is often a by-product of means-tested benefit: it is not a matter of whether people are rich or poor. Where benefits are universal, such as child benefit, there is little room for fraud.</p> <p>You do not address my second argument. If there were a loan system, at least pupils whose parents refuse to help would not suffer by comparison.</p> <p>I no more than you want education to be the preserve of the few. But how can you pretend that the system as it stands challenges the different abilities and aptitudes of pupils, let alone a system which inevitably will reflect the aspirations of those who might not otherwise choose to stay on at school? Incentives to stay at school might be better accommodated in a system like those of other European countries where different models of education and training are provided for the post-compulsory ages.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Sheila</p> <p><b>Dear Sheila,</b><br> The case for a means-tested grant paid to those who most need extra support is, in fact, a strong one. Ask ordinary people whether their taxes should pay for additional hand-outs to the children of Richard Branson, or some other millionaire. Few would be happy.</p> <p>It is also a weak argument to state that support for the less well off should not be offered at all, or be universalised, because of a dishonest minority. This is as feeble as arguing that we should have no shops, in case some people go shoplifting.</p> <p>Those parents who could afford it, but refuse to pay, are not a reason for scuppering the whole system. The state has to tread warily in these matters, but students are over 16, so they might be permitted to apply for grants directly.</p> <p>You are out of date, by the way, on what schools can and do offer. They have been permitted for some years to teach vocational courses as well as conventional academic programmes. We have many of the European models. The choice available to pupils over 16 is wide.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Ted</p> <p><b>Dear Ted,</b><br> Although the case for means-tested grants has become an ideological sticking point for the left, the economic, social and cultural consequences of means testing have already proved detrimental, often for those whom they are designed to help. Let us address the argument: is means testing good for society as a whole and good for those targeted? Hatred of millionaires is no substitute for a proper case.</p> <p>Nor do you give good reason to reject the point that universal benefits make for a healthier system; though some (on both right and left) attack child benefit, nonetheless the body of support in its favour goes back to Beveridge, who had worked on social policy with Labour and Conservative governments for 40 years. The country hated the intrusion, testing and deterrent which means testing requires. The latest select committee inquiry into the contributory principle suggests that the evidence still bears this out.</p> <p>I am aware that schools now offer vocational courses. But the problem remains that of an outdated comprehensive system imposed on this country - with some diversity at the edges. We lack the diversified system of education and training post-16 which many European countries have. Now the plan is to bring higher education into line with the comprehensive model. Would we not be better with a properly diversified system to accommodate academic education, training, and vocational and professional teaching?</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Sheila</p> <p><b>Dear Sheila,</b><br> This has nothing to do with hatred of millionaires. My argument against giving state bounties indiscriminately is driven by fairness. The only two millionaires I know are thoroughly decent types who do not need extra state assistance. Your belief that, to avoid fraud, they should be given money willy-nilly is a novel version of Robin Hood, to say the least.</p> <p>The first-order issue is simple: should we give financial support for further study to 16-year-olds whose families may not be able to afford to pay for education? My answer is an unequivocal yes. You reject this proposal because of a second-order issue, means testing, which is a matter of delivery.</p> <p>You say that diversity cannot be provided by \"an outdated comprehensive system imposed on this country\" (mostly agreed by Margaret Thatcher in the early 70s, it must be said). It is as if there are no diversified schools, no further education or tertiary colleges - major providers of post-16 education. </p> <p>A levels, GCSEs, vocational qualifications drip out of every pore. Do we help people or leave them to their bootstraps; trust them or suspect them of likely fraud? I prefer support and trust, if the baneful grasp of poverty is ever to be slipped.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Ted</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.politeia.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Politeia</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.dfee.gov.uk/ \" target=\"_&quot;new&quot;\">Department for education and employment</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.weasel.cwc.net/beveridge.htm\" target=\"_new\">Key points of the Beveridge report</a><br></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3976089,00.html\">\u00a340 a week to stay at school</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3976974,00.html\">Schools booster to bypass councils</a><br></p>",

Young people are being judged and favoured because their parents declare they cannot pay for them to remain in school. But what of those young people whose parents will not pay? Would it not be better to establish a sensible loans system (extending and improving that available for higher education), where repayment is linked to earning in later life with a low (or no) interest rate, open to all? Third, there is no evidence that state bribes, such as these allowances, will do much to affect the pattern of life of those who take advantage of them. They may stay at school, but will they learn much? Instead of pursuing the paths followed by so many other countries which allow for differences in aptitude and ability, education in England and Wales has been systematically designed to promote mediocre uniformity. Skewing the system further by paying people to stay on who may not otherwise will lead yet further in this direction. Yours sincerely, Sheila Lawlor Politeia social policy institute Dear Sheila, I'm strongly in favour of giving financial support to young people who might not otherwise be able to study further. Education is a liberation from dependency, not a recipe for it. I disagree with all three of your objections. First, what is wrong with checking out need through means testing? The alternatives are either no support at all, or giving the same amount to everyone, pauper or billionaire. This is what happened with nursery vouchers, an indiscriminate hand-out which subsidised wealthy people patronising expensive private establishments. Public funds are not limitless, so they should be concentrated on the needy. You also suggest there would be fraud. Why do you assume greater fraud from the poor than among rich tax fiddlers? There is more suspicion of fiddling in your second point (\"or say they earn\"). A further two years of loans, added to at least three years of them in higher education, would saddle young people with an even greater debt. If education eventually does bring financial bounties, then the recipient will in any case be paying more back to society in taxes. Your third point is equally demeaning of the poor. This is revealed in the emotive language you use: \"bribes\", \"will they learn much?\", \"mediocre uniformity\", as if the less well off invariably drag down the rest. I do not share this view of an unwashed peasantry, likely to spoil a nice party if allowed through the door. Education is far too important to be the exclusive domain of the few. The entry fee to our rapidly changing society, where the unskilled and under-educated are increasingly vulnerable, has gone up. A humane and far-sighted society offers all children the chance to acquire the knowledge and skills that they will need. Yours sincerely, Ted Wragg Professor of education, University of Exeter Dear Ted, There's a strong case to be made against means testing. Beveridge rejected it, and economists now recognise that means tests create dependency traps, so that the people on the lowest incomes pay high marginal rates of tax. Fraud is often a by-product of means-tested benefit: it is not a matter of whether people are rich or poor. Where benefits are universal, such as child benefit, there is little room for fraud. You do not address my second argument. If there were a loan system, at least pupils whose parents refuse to help would not suffer by comparison. I no more than you want education to be the preserve of the few. But how can you pretend that the system as it stands challenges the different abilities and aptitudes of pupils, let alone a system which inevitably will reflect the aspirations of those who might not otherwise choose to stay on at school? Incentives to stay at school might be better accommodated in a system like those of other European countries where different models of education and training are provided for the post-compulsory ages. Yours sincerely, Sheila Dear Sheila, The case for a means-tested grant paid to those who most need extra support is, in fact, a strong one. Ask ordinary people whether their taxes should pay for additional hand-outs to the children of Richard Branson, or some other millionaire. Few would be happy. It is also a weak argument to state that support for the less well off should not be offered at all, or be universalised, because of a dishonest minority. This is as feeble as arguing that we should have no shops, in case some people go shoplifting. Those parents who could afford it, but refuse to pay, are not a reason for scuppering the whole system. The state has to tread warily in these matters, but students are over 16, so they might be permitted to apply for grants directly. You are out of date, by the way, on what schools can and do offer. They have been permitted for some years to teach vocational courses as well as conventional academic programmes. We have many of the European models. The choice available to pupils over 16 is wide. Yours sincerely, Ted Dear Ted, Although the case for means-tested grants has become an ideological sticking point for the left, the economic, social and cultural consequences of means testing have already proved detrimental, often for those whom they are designed to help. Let us address the argument: is means testing good for society as a whole and good for those targeted? Hatred of millionaires is no substitute for a proper case. Nor do you give good reason to reject the point that universal benefits make for a healthier system; though some (on both right and left) attack child benefit, nonetheless the body of support in its favour goes back to Beveridge, who had worked on social policy with Labour and Conservative governments for 40 years. The country hated the intrusion, testing and deterrent which means testing requires. The latest select committee inquiry into the contributory principle suggests that the evidence still bears this out. I am aware that schools now offer vocational courses. But the problem remains that of an outdated comprehensive system imposed on this country - with some diversity at the edges. We lack the diversified system of education and training post-16 which many European countries have. Now the plan is to bring higher education into line with the comprehensive model. Would we not be better with a properly diversified system to accommodate academic education, training, and vocational and professional teaching? Yours sincerely, Sheila Dear Sheila, This has nothing to do with hatred of millionaires. My argument against giving state bounties indiscriminately is driven by fairness. The only two millionaires I know are thoroughly decent types who do not need extra state assistance. Your belief that, to avoid fraud, they should be given money willy-nilly is a novel version of Robin Hood, to say the least. The first-order issue is simple: should we give financial support for further study to 16-year-olds whose families may not be able to afford to pay for education? My answer is an unequivocal yes. You reject this proposal because of a second-order issue, means testing, which is a matter of delivery. You say that diversity cannot be provided by \"an outdated comprehensive system imposed on this country\" (mostly agreed by Margaret Thatcher in the early 70s, it must be said). It is as if there are no diversified schools, no further education or tertiary colleges - major providers of post-16 education. A levels, GCSEs, vocational qualifications drip out of every pore. Do we help people or leave them to their bootstraps; trust them or suspect them of likely fraud? I prefer support and trust, if the baneful grasp of poverty is ever to be slipped.

The state-owned company's claim to be the country's biggest yen earner and a highly profitable contributor to the Treasury and the economy of the north-west has always won over both Labour and Conservative administrations. </p> <p>The last few months have been the blackest in the company's history. Leaks and excessive discharges have brought criticism in Europe, particularly from Ireland, but BNFL had always managed to keep its overseas customers, particularly Japan, on side. </p> <p>All that began to go badly wrong last September. It was then that falsified documents were discovered in the plutonium plant at Sellafield. These were not safety documents but quality controls. They had been requested by the Japanese customers to make sure that when the fuel pellets were loaded into Japanese reactors they performed perfectly. </p> <p>It transpired that the workers, not properly trained or controlled by managers, had been too lazy and so used a computer to copy previous quality control checks and falsified the documents. </p> <p>But this appalling gaffe was not what wrecked the company's reputation in Japan. BNFL insisted that there was nothing untoward with the fuel pellets it had already shipped to Japan. This was important both to the Japanese utility Kansai Electric and BNFL because the fuel had just arrived after a 12,000-mile journey by two armed ships. It would have been unthinkable to send the fuel back. </p> <p>But BNFL was not telling the truth. An investigation by the government watchdog, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), revealed suspect batches had been sent to Japan. </p> <p>BNFL persisted with its claim for more than three months until opponents of plutonium fuel in Japan obtained the quality control documents and found two of them had also been falsified. The dam burst, the Japanese were more than hurt, it was a national loss of face. BNFL had lost the trust of its biggest customer. </p> <p>The Japanese government joined in the chorus of disapproval and demanded that the spent fuel be taken back. Since then the British government has faced the indignity of pleading with the Japanese not to insist on this demand. Sending two armed ships all the way from Barrow-in-Furness to Japan on a 24,000-mile round trip to bring the fuel back would be a thundering embarrassment. </p> <p>The situation worsened when NII published a devastating account into the falsification scandal and general safety at the site. A third report into the handling of high-level liquid waste underlined the unsatisfactory state of affairs at Sellafield. </p> <p>The Germans, Sellafield's second biggest customer, also had new ammunition. In February, when the report into the falsification scandal was completed, it was clear that the Japanese were not the only victims. The Germans too had been sent fuel with false documentation and worse still it had been burning away in one of their reactors since 1996. </p> <p>The Germans immediately shut the reactor down and extracted the fuel, and are demanding compensation. They also suspended business with BNFL until safety issues had been sorted out. </p> <p>BNFL was grovelling to the Japanese, but said it was confident it could restore goodwill. That was a few days before the government decided that John Taylor, the chief executive, had to carry the can for management failings. Only he and the five workers who originally falsified the documents have so far lost their jobs, although the NII made it clear the faults lay at every level in the company. </p> <p>BNFL's other customers appear anxious to pull out. First the Swedes decided that a licence to export spent fuel from a research reactor would not be granted. </p> <p>A new blow came this week when a different kind of BNFL contract was called into question. The company has bought Westinghouse, the US nuclear company, and put huge emphasis on contracts potentially worth \u00a355bn to clean up old military sites in the US. Current contracts are worth \u00a36bn but in a classic phrase Bill Richardson, the US energy secretary, said \"business as usual is over with BNFL\". He is sending an investigation team over to Sellafield. </p> <p>Within 24 hours the Swiss, the last remaining big overseas customer of Sellafield, said they too were suspending contracts, this time for sending spent fuel rods to be reprocessed at the giant Thorp works. They were particularly concerned because of sabotage at the works where giant robots had been disabled in a high security area. </p> <p>Thorp, which cost \u00a31.8bn, has never worked to full capacity. It is beginning to look like a white elephant, not least because British Energy, the privatised nuclear generator, has considered renegotiating its contracts so spent fuel is stored rather than reprocessed. This option would be much cheaper. </p> <p>Only months ago the government was looking to privatise 49% of BNFL and raise \u00a31.5bn before the next election. One of the hold-ups for this plan was the company's safety record, which clearly still needs to be improved. The second was the \u00a3300m plutonium fuel production plant, or Mox, that was awaiting a licence to operate at Sellafield. The company had built on spec with taxpayers' money but John Prescott, as environment secretary, cannot give it a licence until it can be justified economically. Its main customers were the Japanese the Germans, and the Swiss. All three have now bolted. </p> <p>Sellafield's future now looks bleak. </p> <p><strong>On the site</strong></p> <p><strong> Calder Hall </strong> (1956):the world's first nuclear power station opened </p> <p><strong> Magnox reprocessing </strong> (1950s): deals with the spent fuel from reactors </p> <p><strong> Thorp works</strong> (1993): reprocesses spent fuel from newer reactors </p> <p><strong> Mox plant </strong> (1997): makes mixed oxide fuel out of Thorp reprocessed materials </p> <p><strong> Demonstration </strong> and waste processing plants, including the making of high-level liquid waste into glass blocks</p>",

It transpired that the workers, not properly trained or controlled by managers, had been too lazy and so used a computer to copy previous quality control checks and falsified the documents. But this appalling gaffe was not what wrecked the company's reputation in Japan. BNFL insisted that there was nothing untoward with the fuel pellets it had already shipped to Japan. This was important both to the Japanese utility Kansai Electric and BNFL because the fuel had just arrived after a 12,000-mile journey by two armed ships. It would have been unthinkable to send the fuel back. But BNFL was not telling the truth. An investigation by the government watchdog, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), revealed suspect batches had been sent to Japan. BNFL persisted with its claim for more than three months until opponents of plutonium fuel in Japan obtained the quality control documents and found two of them had also been falsified. The dam burst, the Japanese were more than hurt, it was a national loss of face. BNFL had lost the trust of its biggest customer. The Japanese government joined in the chorus of disapproval and demanded that the spent fuel be taken back. Since then the British government has faced the indignity of pleading with the Japanese not to insist on this demand. Sending two armed ships all the way from Barrow-in-Furness to Japan on a 24,000-mile round trip to bring the fuel back would be a thundering embarrassment. The situation worsened when NII published a devastating account into the falsification scandal and general safety at the site. A third report into the handling of high-level liquid waste underlined the unsatisfactory state of affairs at Sellafield. The Germans, Sellafield's second biggest customer, also had new ammunition. In February, when the report into the falsification scandal was completed, it was clear that the Japanese were not the only victims. The Germans too had been sent fuel with false documentation and worse still it had been burning away in one of their reactors since 1996. The Germans immediately shut the reactor down and extracted the fuel, and are demanding compensation. They also suspended business with BNFL until safety issues had been sorted out. BNFL was grovelling to the Japanese, but said it was confident it could restore goodwill. That was a few days before the government decided that John Taylor, the chief executive, had to carry the can for management failings. Only he and the five workers who originally falsified the documents have so far lost their jobs, although the NII made it clear the faults lay at every level in the company. BNFL's other customers appear anxious to pull out. First the Swedes decided that a licence to export spent fuel from a research reactor would not be granted. A new blow came this week when a different kind of BNFL contract was called into question. The company has bought Westinghouse, the US nuclear company, and put huge emphasis on contracts potentially worth \u00a355bn to clean up old military sites in the US. Current contracts are worth \u00a36bn but in a classic phrase Bill Richardson, the US energy secretary, said \"business as usual is over with BNFL\". He is sending an investigation team over to Sellafield. Within 24 hours the Swiss, the last remaining big overseas customer of Sellafield, said they too were suspending contracts, this time for sending spent fuel rods to be reprocessed at the giant Thorp works. They were particularly concerned because of sabotage at the works where giant robots had been disabled in a high security area. Thorp, which cost \u00a31.8bn, has never worked to full capacity. It is beginning to look like a white elephant, not least because British Energy, the privatised nuclear generator, has considered renegotiating its contracts so spent fuel is stored rather than reprocessed. This option would be much cheaper. Only months ago the government was looking to privatise 49% of BNFL and raise \u00a31.5bn before the next election. One of the hold-ups for this plan was the company's safety record, which clearly still needs to be improved. The second was the \u00a3300m plutonium fuel production plant, or Mox, that was awaiting a licence to operate at Sellafield. The company had built on spec with taxpayers' money but John Prescott, as environment secretary, cannot give it a licence until it can be justified economically. Its main customers were the Japanese the Germans, and the Swiss. All three have now bolted. Sellafield's future now looks bleak. On the site Calder Hall (1956):the world's first nuclear power station opened Magnox reprocessing (1950s): deals with the spent fuel from reactors Thorp works (1993): reprocesses spent fuel from newer reactors Mox plant (1997): makes mixed oxide fuel out of Thorp reprocessed materials Demonstration and waste processing plants, including the making of high-level liquid waste into glass blocks",

Instead, they wait until the cooler winter months (April - October) when night breezes necessitate jumpers and frost can coat the windows of four-wheel-drives in the morning. The cooler temperatures also force the many venomous snakes and spiders into hibernation. </p> <p>However, the full heat of summer is when the desert shows off its awesome powers and draws the adventurous traveller. The only other person I saw on the Birdsville Track was a lone Austrian motorcyclist - sunburnt but smiling. We met at a break in the Dog Fence, a 3,300-mile-long barrier that runs from the east coast of Australia through the Red Centre and down to the south coast near the border between Western and South Australia. It was built to protect the sheep in the south from the packs of dingoes in the north. We swatted flies for a few minutes and went our separate ways.</p> <p> I met the biker again that evening at the Prairie Hotel at Parachilna, between Marree and Hawker. We shouldn't have been surprised as this is one of the few hotels for miles and it draws most people who travel around these parts. It is an oasis. Out of the blinding sunlight, guests walk into an air-conditioned bar playing funky music and serving ice-cold beers and snacks. I almost had to step outside and come back in again to check this wasn't another cruel mirage.</p> <p> On the bar wall is the menu, the real reason for people flocking to the Prairie (and they do, so book early). This is the home of Feral Food, an array of delicious bush tucker cooked up by chef Danni Murray, a local woman who specialises in outback cuisine. \"I eat most things but not kangaroo,\" she said after I'd tucked into a roo steak. \"We used to keep them as pets when I was a child.\" Luckily for vegetarians, she also prepares some stunning meat-free dishes. Later, I dined on emu, camel sausages and goat cutlets, and sank a full-bodied red wine from the Clare Valley, a day's drive to the south. Great food but it needed walking off and I stepped outside on to the still warm desert floor for an evening stroll. The winds had eased and the Flinders Ranges were silhouetted against a rising moon. I felt free, de-programmed from the stress of day-to-day life, and was beginning to love the isolation.

Instead, they wait until the cooler winter months (April - October) when night breezes necessitate jumpers and frost can coat the windows of four-wheel-drives in the morning. The cooler temperatures also force the many venomous snakes and spiders into hibernation. However, the full heat of summer is when the desert shows off its awesome powers and draws the adventurous traveller. The only other person I saw on the Birdsville Track was a lone Austrian motorcyclist - sunburnt but smiling. We met at a break in the Dog Fence, a 3,300-mile-long barrier that runs from the east coast of Australia through the Red Centre and down to the south coast near the border between Western and South Australia. It was built to protect the sheep in the south from the packs of dingoes in the north. We swatted flies for a few minutes and went our separate ways. I met the biker again that evening at the Prairie Hotel at Parachilna, between Marree and Hawker. We shouldn't have been surprised as this is one of the few hotels for miles and it draws most people who travel around these parts. It is an oasis. Out of the blinding sunlight, guests walk into an air-conditioned bar playing funky music and serving ice-cold beers and snacks. I almost had to step outside and come back in again to check this wasn't another cruel mirage. On the bar wall is the menu, the real reason for people flocking to the Prairie (and they do, so book early). This is the home of Feral Food, an array of delicious bush tucker cooked up by chef Danni Murray, a local woman who specialises in outback cuisine. \"I eat most things but not kangaroo,\" she said after I'd tucked into a roo steak. \"We used to keep them as pets when I was a child.\" Luckily for vegetarians, she also prepares some stunning meat-free dishes. Later, I dined on emu, camel sausages and goat cutlets, and sank a full-bodied red wine from the Clare Valley, a day's drive to the south. Great food but it needed walking off and I stepped outside on to the still warm desert floor for an evening stroll. The winds had eased and the Flinders Ranges were silhouetted against a rising moon. I felt free, de-programmed from the stress of day-to-day life, and was beginning to love the isolation. The desert had me transfixed. The practicals Matthew Brace travelled as a guest of South Australia Tourism. Flights: Qantas Airways (0345 747767) has daily flights to Adelaide, with fares starting from \u00a3715 return (excluding taxes), including two free stopovers in Asia. Qantas' Boomerang Pass, used in conjunction with an inter-national ticket, opens up destinations across five zones covering Australia, New Zealand and the South West Pacific. Fly within a single zone for \u00a395 and across zones from \u00a3110 per sector. If you book direct with the airline, it will also arrange your visa free of charge (a saving of around \u00a38). Accommodation: Outback Chapmanton Hotel in Hawker (tel: 00 61 8 8648 4100) charges from \u00a325 a night for single occupancy on a room-only basis. The Prairie Hotel at Parachilna (tel: 00 61 8 8648 4895) charges from \u00a328 a night single occupancy on a room-only basis. Tours: Fray Aborignal culture tours are tailormade and prices vary greatly according to the number of guides and vehicles used, the number in the group and where they go. A private tour costs around \u00a3390 for a full day, including all transport, sightseeing, meals and the services of an Aboriginal tour guide.

Who better to teach the English a foreign language than the practitioners - at United, Peter Schmeichel, Eric Cantona, Jaap Stam; at Arsenal, half a team; at Chelsea, a whole team. \"Of course, the success is down to the English players and managers but it's also down to the foreigners,\" says Chelsea's manager Gianluca Vialli. \"We've done our best to improve the game in England so it makes me happy that we are now one of the clubs to beat in Europe. \"You need to get overseas players in.That was the signal for Italian clubs to be successful in Europe and, if you don't do that while other clubs are doing it, then you fall behind them and the gap becomes too difficult to catch up.\" English clubs have still not won anything in Europe this season, so judgment on the extent of their revival should be reserved. But it does seem that the English are back, even if it is with a little help from their friends.",

      "body": "<p>In the UK, teaching has never been high on the list of aspirational careers. Why enter a profession where the rewards are as low as the morale when you can enjoy the buzz of the City, the kudos of law or the glamour of, say, advertising? And for entrepreneurial spirits there's no quicker way to pay off your student loan than by getting into a dot.com. </p> <p>As for leaving a glittering perch at the top of some corporate tree to serve a sentence at the chalkface, who would even consider it? Teachers are leaving the profession in droves; stories of heavy workloads, stress and red tape are rife - isn't this something to be avoided at all costs? </p> <p>But Dr Avril Henney did just this a while ago. A degree in biochemistry from Edinburgh university, followed by a PhD, led to a career in accountancy, where she specialised in corporate tax working in the City for KPMG. She enjoyed the stimulus of working with some of the most talented Oxbridge graduates - and the social life that went with it. </p> <p>Today, Dr Henney teaches science at Edmonton county school in Enfield. Her teaching style is a far cry from chalk-and-talk and her energy is seemingly boundless. </p> <p>\"I like the fact that it's so dynamic. No two days are the same. The children keep you on your toes and there's never that feeling of 'oh, still four hours to go', Dr Henney says. She finds it easier to set her alarm for 4am and do lesson preparation and marking before breakfast rather than working until midnight, as teachers often have to. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't have got up at four in the morning to do work at KPMG, but the children motivate you. In one job you're making people richer; in the other you're giving people opportunities.\" </p> <p>Admittedly, Dr Henney's primary motivation for going into teaching was the birth of her child and the desire to work fewer hours. But she currently works longer hours than she ever did in the City and, as she has separated from her husband, she is now bringing up her six-year-old daughter Mary, on her own. </p> <p>Yet, fulfilling the words of Aristotle: \"Where your talents and the needs of the world cross, there lies your vocation,\" Dr Henney seems to have found hers. \"Although I think it's a profession where you shouldn't spend your whole life,\" she observes. \"You either devote your youth to it and then move on to something else or do something else in your youth and then devote your maturity to it. It's so demanding: there's a sacrificial element to it and there's only so much you can give. But when you can actually see children improving, it gives you a real buzz.\" </p> <p>Teaching as a second career is something the Teaching Training Agency is keen to encourage. Ralph Tabberer, its new chief executive, is anxious to dispel any negative myths. \"There has never been a better time to come into teaching,\" he claims. \"And if you come in as a mature entrant, you'll find there are a lot of opportunities.\" These include the new levels of pay attainable by teachers - up to \u00a342,000 - which mean proving your capabilities to get through the \"threshold\": to bump up your salary without taking on extra responsibilities outside the classroom. </p> <p>The next wave of the advertising campaign: \"No one forgets a good teacher\" will be launched in cinemas at the end of this month, and will focus on the many skills utilised in the daily dramas of the profession. </p> <p>Transferring skills from business to teaching may not at first be obvious, yet one of the children in Dr Henney's Year 11 science class was quick to point them out: \"She has a very different teaching style: she's lively and she makes us do lots of activities and work together. She makes us do presentations: I had to do research and then give a talk on acid rain.\" Interactive activities and addressing a group of people are all par for the course in corporate terms. And, borrowing from corporate jargon, dare one say that a new teacher with a rich and varied background might have something different to bring to the party? </p> <p>\"Some people go to school, go on to university then go straight back into the classroom,\" says Dr Henney. \"I'm not saying that this isn't valuable because they're very committed, but I think I have a richness of experience and I do feel confident.\" </p> <p>Confidence is vital in order to gain credibility in front of a class and the \"Don't smile before Christmas\" piece of advice has always been meted out to fresh-faced, green teachers, with the underlying warning: \"It's tough out there.\" </p> <p>Someone who is now realising that going into teaching straight from university would have been daunting is Michael Davies, who is also taking up the chalk in a second career. </p> <p>\"I would not have been a good teacher when I was 20. I wanted a more glamorous lifestyle, but now my priorities have changed. I actually don't think I would have had enough life experience - including having children of my own - to allow me to operate successfully in a tough secondary school. I think I would have been chewed up.\" </p> <p>The \"glamorous lifestyle\" was that of a management consultant, which took Mr Davies and his family to Chicago where \"everything was swimming along.\" Nevertheless, something drove Mr Davies to give it all up and return to the UK, where he is now studying at St Martin's College in Lancaster and is looking forward to a new career - teaching history. </p> <p>\"It wasn't that I was dissatisfied with my life, but it was a sense of wanting to do something more important. When you die, and it all flashes back in front of you, you don't want to think 'that was a comfortable ride, but shouldn't I have done a bit more?'\" As the whole family was involved in Mr Davies' holistic lifeshift - he saved up enough money to do the course and live for a year and has managed to reduce the family outgoings by one-fifth - he is pleased that his wife was the catalyst in the whole process. </p> <p>\"We were on holiday and I was talking about all the things I think are important in life and she said: 'Did you ever think about teaching history?' I had this sense that if we were prepared to give it all up, then I could go and do something which is truly important. And I can't think of anything more important than teaching.\" </p> <p>As one of the oldest students on his course (only three out of 30 are over 40), Mr Davies is passionate about his subject. \"I think history helps with an understanding of where we've come from. Without it there's a danger that we become rootless. It's an essential part of understanding who and where we are, not just as a country, but also as individuals.\" </p> <p>Mr Davies is currently doing his teaching practice at local schools and feels that when he qualifies, he might have more to offer the state, rather than the independent sector: offering advice about careers; contacts in the US and generally: \"a perspective of life outside teaching.\" </p> <p>While he admits that a teacher's salary is not princely - he can look forward to a starting salary of around \u00a315,537 - Mr Davies remains positive that he has made the right decision. \"You just have to spend less. It depends where your priorities are. Although you start low, it does go up.\" </p> <p>When it comes to figures, targets may be anathema to teachers who have always worked in an academic environment. </p> <p>David Blunkett's new challenge is that there should be no schools with fewer than 20% of its pupils achieving five passes at GCSE but Michael Davies is unfazed. \"I think teaching is going to be much more performance-orientated in the future which, if it's implemented properly, I'd welcome. I think the annual assessments and management reporting elements are going in the right direction, but unfortunately the actual process is very cumbersome and paper-driven and that puts people off.\" Ever the optimist, he believes that morale in teaching can only improve: \"I think that there are some good things happening and that we will see the benefits. My impression is that teachers feel undervalued, under-led and over-managed.\" </p> <p>Possibly finding it difficult to shed the mantle of a management consultant, Mr Davies has his own solutions: \"To push more power, more authority and decisions about money, and more money, down to the schools.\" </p> <p>As for Dr Avril Henney, who believes that a \"proper admin department\" would help with the processing of what she describes as \"punishing\" amounts of paperwork, she is already realising why teachers need longer holidays than most. \"During that time you're recuperating,\" she says. </p> <p>And while she sometimes misses long lunches in the City, the ability to make personal phone calls and drink coffee throughout the day - she's quite happy to have given it all up. \"However high-powered your job may be, there is still a lot of boredom.\" </p> <p>She was advised long ago by her mother, who was a former teacher, to go into the profession when she graduated, but Dr Henney thought she knew better. \"My mother said that it was the best job out and she's probably right.\" </p> <p>When she eventually did choose to become a teacher later in life, her mother said: \"You could have done that 15 years ago.\" </p> <p>\"I could have done,\" admits Dr Henney, \"but it would have been different.\" </p> <p><strong>Learning curve</strong></p> <p><strong> Where to go</strong></p> <p>\u0095 The Golden Hello is a \u00a35,000 grant available to newly qualified teachers of shortage subjects such as maths, science and modern languages. </p> <p>\u0095 The Teaching Training Agency now has a presence on the websites of some of the insurance companies and banks currently making redundancies, in the hope of attracting people to teaching as a second career.

      "body": "<p>If all schools were run like Summerhill, the radically unconventional institution in Suffolk developed by AS Neill and now run by his daughter, Zoe Readhead, the educational system in Britain would collapse.

      "body": "<p>Keith Kirkman serves tea and gingerbread on his manicured lawn as if there is nothing on his mind except what to feed his prize bull. But just 200 metres away Thembani Mhembere sits under a tarpaulin in a crude camp where 60 supporters of President Robert Mugabe have been staying for nearly a month. They are living on the Kirkman farm to claim it as their own.</p> <p>The Kirkman farm is just one of hundreds disrupted by Mr Mugabe's followers. By yesterday the squatters had invaded 731 large white-owned farms, out of Zimbabwe's 4,200 commercial farms.</p> <p>The farmers are trying to keep going, but it is clear that the occupations have significantly disrupted their work, including the crucial reaping and curing of the tobacco crop, which accounts for 40% of Zimbabwe's export earnings.</p> <p>Despite a high court order for the police to remove the squatters, the authorities have taken no action to resolve the problem. Mr Mugabe himself has enthusiastically endorsed the occupations.</p> <p>Land was one of the key issues over which the war against Rhodesian rule was fought in the 70s. Since independence in 1980 Mr Mugabe's government has carried out a limited redistribution, buying white-owned farms and turning the land over to poor blacks. In recent years Mr Mugabe has stirred up sentiment on the land issue, but has not implemented any logical plan to redress the imbalance.</p> <p>Veterans of the war to end Rhodesian rule have spearheaded the recent farm invasions, with help from Mr Mugabe's central intelligence organisation. They have enlisted unemployed youths to help them occupy the farms.</p> <p>The squatters on the Kirkman farm have been aggressive and abusive and have destroyed some property, but in the past week the situation has settled down to an uneasy truce.</p> <p>This week the veterans moved on to invade other farms. Mr Mhembere is one of the young men they left behind to maintain their claim.</p> <p>The lives of Keith Kirkman and Thembani Mhembere are worlds apart. One enjoys a gracious and productive life; the other is desperate and idle. But as they describe their hopes for Zimbabwe, it is apparent that they do not have to be pitted against one another.</p> <p>Both believe that Zimbabwe's land could support them all. Both express the willingness to work together. Without the manipulations of politicians, it is possible that a sustainable land redistribution plan could resolve this historical grievance. That provides a glimmer of hope in Zimbabwe's current economic and political crises.</p> <p><b>Keith Kirkman, 63, is a farmer</b></p> <p>My family has been farming here for over 100 years. My grandfather came here in 1894 and worked for the municipality of Salisbury. He bought - not stole - a property south of Salisbury. My father started farming in 1920 and he came here in 1936.</p> <p>I started farming tobacco, but in 1966 I switched to food crops. Now I grow maize, soya beans, sorghum, sunflowers and seed maize. We also raise cattle for beef and for stud. We have three children and one is a farmer. We employ about 80 workers full-time.</p> <p>During the war [against Rhodesian rule] we were under a degree of threat, but we kept farming. It was a major relief in 1980 when that war came to an end. We were extremely concerned about the advent of majority rule when Mr Mugabe came to power. But... he quickly established a rapport to make us feel that we could give it a go and keep farming.</p> <p>By about 1986 we began to question what Mr Mugabe was saying and doing, but we still thought he was our man. But for the last four or five years we haven't liked him at all. We don't like the way he is managing the country and we don't like his economic policies.</p> <p>On March 5 about 60 people came to our farm and demanded that I give them some of our land. I refused. I said I would work with the government of the day. They said they were the government and I should give them my land.</p> <p>The next day I told them I would cooperate with the government but I would not do things on an ad hoc basis. Land resettlement must be done with proper identification of farms, selection of people to be resettled, training of farmers, provision of seed and fertiliser, sourcing of funds, and international aid.</p> <p>Things existed on a fairly good basis until last week. [Then] they got angry and some were drunk. They were offensive and aggressive.</p> <p>These invasions are well orchestrated. They are not haphazard and I do not think they will go away soon.</p> <p>Something tangible has got to be done. It is no good blaming the whites or the British government. Whatever it takes to make it happen must be done.</p> <p>We're an agriculturally based economy. The resettlement must not interfere with the basis of production. I am just the custodian of this land and it burns me up to see productive land become unproductive. But if resettlement is done properly with supervision and technical assistance, then production can be maintained.</p> <p>I want to see farms taken over and see the land remain productive. If you can demonstrate success, then the willingness to make land available would increase.</p> <p><b>Thembani Mhembere, 23, would like to be one, too</b></p> <p>My name is Thembani Mhembere and I am 23 years old. I was just a small boy when Zimbabwe became independent. My father died that same year, in 1980. My mother had to raise eight children: seven boys and one girl. I am the youngest in my family. My mother died in 1999.</p> <p>We have always lived in Norton, in Ngoni Township. I went to school up to Form 3, but my mother was not able to send me any further.</p> <p>I have had temporary jobs working for Norton rural council, clearing roads, cutting down weeds and cleaning out the council beerhall. But it is not enough money to support myself. My brothers have had similar temporary jobs, but only one has a full-time job. He works for the city of Harare.</p> <p>I heard the news that the war veterans are getting soil for the people and they are getting farms. I decided to go with them. So now I am their assistant to help get the land. I would like to get a nice piece of land for myself, to help my family. I don't want the whole farm, just a small piece so we can help ourselves to get better lives.</p> <p>My parents do not have a kumusha [Shona for rural homestead]. They have always had a city life.</p> <p>I want to be a farmer. I want to have my own piece of land for my family. I would also like to be able to help my brothers.</p> <p>I would like to grow maize and other crops, but I am a city boy and I have never farmed before, so I would have to learn how to grow different crops.</p> <p>I would like to grow what they grow on this farm: soya beans, maize, sorghum, beans, potatoes.</p> <p>I am married and we have one child, a daughter who is three years old. I am doing this because I can see that my life will just stay the same unless I do something.

      "bodyText": "Keith Kirkman serves tea and gingerbread on his manicured lawn as if there is nothing on his mind except what to feed his prize bull. But just 200 metres away Thembani Mhembere sits under a tarpaulin in a crude camp where 60 supporters of President Robert Mugabe have been staying for nearly a month. They are living on the Kirkman farm to claim it as their own. The Kirkman farm is just one of hundreds disrupted by Mr Mugabe's followers. By yesterday the squatters had invaded 731 large white-owned farms, out of Zimbabwe's 4,200 commercial farms. The farmers are trying to keep going, but it is clear that the occupations have significantly disrupted their work, including the crucial reaping and curing of the tobacco crop, which accounts for 40% of Zimbabwe's export earnings. Despite a high court order for the police to remove the squatters, the authorities have taken no action to resolve the problem. Mr Mugabe himself has enthusiastically endorsed the occupations. Land was one of the key issues over which the war against Rhodesian rule was fought in the 70s. Since independence in 1980 Mr Mugabe's government has carried out a limited redistribution, buying white-owned farms and turning the land over to poor blacks. In recent years Mr Mugabe has stirred up sentiment on the land issue, but has not implemented any logical plan to redress the imbalance. Veterans of the war to end Rhodesian rule have spearheaded the recent farm invasions, with help from Mr Mugabe's central intelligence organisation. They have enlisted unemployed youths to help them occupy the farms. The squatters on the Kirkman farm have been aggressive and abusive and have destroyed some property, but in the past week the situation has settled down to an uneasy truce. This week the veterans moved on to invade other farms. Mr Mhembere is one of the young men they left behind to maintain their claim. The lives of Keith Kirkman and Thembani Mhembere are worlds apart. One enjoys a gracious and productive life; the other is desperate and idle. But as they describe their hopes for Zimbabwe, it is apparent that they do not have to be pitted against one another. Both believe that Zimbabwe's land could support them all. Both express the willingness to work together. Without the manipulations of politicians, it is possible that a sustainable land redistribution plan could resolve this historical grievance. That provides a glimmer of hope in Zimbabwe's current economic and political crises. Keith Kirkman, 63, is a farmer My family has been farming here for over 100 years. My grandfather came here in 1894 and worked for the municipality of Salisbury. He bought - not stole - a property south of Salisbury. My father started farming in 1920 and he came here in 1936. I started farming tobacco, but in 1966 I switched to food crops. Now I grow maize, soya beans, sorghum, sunflowers and seed maize. We also raise cattle for beef and for stud. We have three children and one is a farmer. We employ about 80 workers full-time. During the war [against Rhodesian rule] we were under a degree of threat, but we kept farming. It was a major relief in 1980 when that war came to an end. We were extremely concerned about the advent of majority rule when Mr Mugabe came to power. But... he quickly established a rapport to make us feel that we could give it a go and keep farming. By about 1986 we began to question what Mr Mugabe was saying and doing, but we still thought he was our man. But for the last four or five years we haven't liked him at all. We don't like the way he is managing the country and we don't like his economic policies. On March 5 about 60 people came to our farm and demanded that I give them some of our land. I refused. I said I would work with the government of the day. They said they were the government and I should give them my land. The next day I told them I would cooperate with the government but I would not do things on an ad hoc basis. Land resettlement must be done with proper identification of farms, selection of people to be resettled, training of farmers, provision of seed and fertiliser, sourcing of funds, and international aid. Things existed on a fairly good basis until last week. [Then] they got angry and some were drunk. They were offensive and aggressive. These invasions are well orchestrated. They are not haphazard and I do not think they will go away soon. Something tangible has got to be done. It is no good blaming the whites or the British government. Whatever it takes to make it happen must be done. We're an agriculturally based economy. The resettlement must not interfere with the basis of production. I am just the custodian of this land and it burns me up to see productive land become unproductive. But if resettlement is done properly with supervision and technical assistance, then production can be maintained. I want to see farms taken over and see the land remain productive. If you can demonstrate success, then the willingness to make land available would increase. Thembani Mhembere, 23, would like to be one, too My name is Thembani Mhembere and I am 23 years old. I was just a small boy when Zimbabwe became independent. My father died that same year, in 1980. My mother had to raise eight children: seven boys and one girl. I am the youngest in my family. My mother died in 1999. We have always lived in Norton, in Ngoni Township. I went to school up to Form 3, but my mother was not able to send me any further. I have had temporary jobs working for Norton rural council, clearing roads, cutting down weeds and cleaning out the council beerhall. But it is not enough money to support myself. My brothers have had similar temporary jobs, but only one has a full-time job. He works for the city of Harare. I heard the news that the war veterans are getting soil for the people and they are getting farms. I decided to go with them. So now I am their assistant to help get the land. I would like to get a nice piece of land for myself, to help my family. I don't want the whole farm, just a small piece so we can help ourselves to get better lives. My parents do not have a kumusha [Shona for rural homestead]. They have always had a city life. I want to be a farmer. I want to have my own piece of land for my family. I would also like to be able to help my brothers. I would like to grow maize and other crops, but I am a city boy and I have never farmed before, so I would have to learn how to grow different crops. I would like to grow what they grow on this farm: soya beans, maize, sorghum, beans, potatoes. I am married and we have one child, a daughter who is three years old. I am doing this because I can see that my life will just stay the same unless I do something. I want to make a better life for my family. I want to share this land with these whites who live here. I would like to see whites and blacks working together. That would be nice. We cannot raise up Zimbabwe without the white people. We were people who did not know much. We can learn from whites. Maybe when we are farming we can ask them and they can help us. Right now the war veterans have gone away and left me here to support our claim.

The damning account said a strong inbuilt racism existed within the police force. Amnesty Austria members called on the government to establish race education programmes from primary school level \"so that children learn a human rights conscience from a young age\". The report, based on the recommendations of the UN committee against torture, detailed eyewitness accounts and medical reports of detainees being kicked, punched, beaten with truncheons and sprayed with pepper. \"Austria is not a torture state, but nevertheless a state that has certainly fallen far short of European Union human rights recommendations,\" said the general secretary of Amnesty International Austria, Heinz Patzelt. The report was published on the same day as a 31-year-old police officer appeared before a Vienna court charged with grevious bodily harm over the beating of a young black African man. The policeman is alleged to have hit the 18-year-old around the genitals with a baseball bat before arresting him in September last year on suspicion of drugs possession. The judge adjourned the trial indefinitely, for more evidence. The Amnesty report said detainees were often denied access to lawyers, doctors or friends, and foreigners, particularly black Africans, had been beaten unconscious for not showing police their papers. The allegations could hardly have come at a worse time for Austria, which has been isolated on the international stage for almost two months since the anti-immigration far-right Freedom party entered the government in a coalition with the conservatives. A spokesman for the interior ministry said it had already begun to look into the Amnesty charges. \"All the allegations will be examined, to see if any judicial and disciplinary measures should be taken,\" he said. The focal point of Amnesty's allegations is the case of Marcus Omofuma, a Nigerian asylum seeker, 25, who died while being deported from Vienna to Sofia in May last year. He was bound and gagged \"like a mummy stuck to the seat\" by the three officers who accompanied him, and arrived unconscious in Sofia where doctors pronounced him dead. No charges were brought. \"Investigations into police ill-treatment have been slow, lacking in thoroughness and often inconclusive,\" said Mr Patzelt. Often, when complaints were made, the police brought counter-charges and more often than not won. Illegal raids on asylum homes were also being regularly reported, he said, citing an incident which occurred after the report was completed, in January this year, when police raided the home of black Africans in Traiskirchen. \"One hundred and forty police stormed the home looking for drugs but nothing was found,\" he said. \"They then carried out painful anal searches, simply because there was some suspicion that there might be drugs there. All you need is a black face to be considered suspicious.\" The report covers incidents that happened before the current government was sworn in. But human rights organisations fear that the rise of the far right has given expression to passive racism in Austria. In what is being seen as a timely move, the EU has chosen to base its new racism monitoring centre in Vienna. \"It wasn't placed here because Austria is seen as being racist,\" insisted EU spokesman John Kellock, \"but if it steps out of line, we'll haul them over the coals.\" The Freedom party and People's party are the only government parties in the EU not to have signed up to the EU's charter against racism because their policies contravene some of the clauses. Fears that intolerance is on the rise in Austria increased this week when the head of the evangelical church, Bishop Gertraud Knoll, said she was going into hiding with her three children because she could no longer stand the violent and sexually abusive letters delivered to her home in Burgenland. Bishop Knoll, 41, has been a staunch critic of the Freedom party and its racist politics for years.",

      "bodyText": "The United States is offering to share its \"star wars\" technology with Russia if Moscow accepts Washington's plans for a national missile protective shield, it emerged yesterday. \"There is potential for technological cooperation of a national missile defence cooperation regime to meet common threats,\" a senior Nato diplomat said. US attempts to persuade the Russians to amend the 1972 anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty between the two countries, opening the way for a limited \"son of star wars\" anti-missile shield, are expected to step up after the Russian presidential election tomorrow. Washington could also hold out the prospect of agreeing in the Start 3 arms reduction talk so deeper cuts, which Moscow would welcome, given its precarious economic state. Despite opposition from Moscow and many of America's European allies, as well as technical problems, Washington has made it clear that it is determined to press ahead with the $13bn (\u00a38.2bn) defence project. A key test due to have taken place next month has been postponed until June, prompting speculation that the decision will not be taken until after the US presidential election in November. But the Nato diplomat said President Bill Clinton could well decide to approve the project in late summer. \"There is a lot of momentum in the US,\" he said. Despite Moscow's public opposition to the project, Washington believes that the Russians are coming around to the view that they face a similar threat from long-range missiles from \"rogue\" states. Although the US is planning to build an arsenal of 200 interceptors based in Alaska and North Dakota, it argues that Moscow has little to worry about, because the US would still not be able to withstand an attack from Russia, given the size of that country's stock of ballistic missiles. Nevertheless, a number of European allies, in particular France, insist that any change in the 1972 ABM treaty could unleash a new arms race. Earlier this week the Foreign Office minister Peter Hain spoke of a \"potential conflict of interests\" between the ABM treaty and Washington's missile defence project, which would involve upgrading spy bases in Britain. Other European allies, notably Germany, are afraid that the project could lead to the decoupling of Nato, giving the US greater protection and security than its partners. Washington is trying to persuade sceptical Europeans that they face the same threat as the US from the growing number of countries with access to long-range missile technology and that they should consider building their own \"theatre missile defence\" systems.",

God will be their judge.\"</p> <p>Mr Putin, 47, is expected to be kept in the Kremlin by Russia's 108m voters, though it is not clear whether he will accomplish that tomorrow or be forced into a run-off in a fortnight.</p> <p>Yesterday's appeal to the electorate was aimed at ensuring a high turnout. At the end of a lacklustre campaign, Kremlin insiders fear that apathy, driven by the assumption that the result is a foregone conclusion, could prevent a first-round triumph.</p> <p>The last presidential election, in 1996, was a close-run contest between Mr Yeltsin and the communist leader, Gennady Zyuganov, which went to a second round. Expected to be the runner-up again this time, Mr Zyuganov is trailing 30 points behind Mr Putin in the opinion polls.</p> <p>But with 11 candidates on the ballot paper, Mr Putin needs half the votes cast to avoid a run-off, and the turn-out has to be 50% for the election to be valid.</p> <p>In the closing days of the campaign the state-run media, hugely instrumental in boosting Mr Putin's popularity, have been smearing Grigory Yavlinsky, the liberal democrat who is third in the polls, in an attempt to keep his vote low and improve Mr Putin's chances of a first round victory.</p> <p>\"The chances of Yavlinsky coming second are next to zero,\" said Boris Berezovsky, the billionaire Kremlin insider who co-owns the main state television channel and exploits it mercilessly to support his favourites and destroy his political opponents.</p> <p>\"Putin has serious support in the regions, and that's why he will win in the first round,\" he told a group of foreign journalists. \"I'll be voting for Putin, because Putin will continue with the reforms and he has the willpower to do it.\"</p> <p>Mr Putin's brutal military campaign against Chechnya has been the key to his rapid emergence from the bureaucratic facelessness of the Russian state, and yesterday he tapped into the sentiment of militarist nationalism that has characterised his nine months as prime minister and three months as acting president.</p> <p>\"We're not only electing a head of state, but also a commander in chief,\" he said, looking solemn and determined. \"Russia is one of the world's biggest states. And a mighty nuclear power. It's not only our friends who know this.\"</p> <p>His exploitation of the Chechen war coincided with further reports of Russian atrocities in Chechnya. Young girls and men were repeatedly gang-raped at a Russian detention camp in Chechnya, according to a former Chechen inmate quoted by Amnesty International.The former prisoner said a girl of 14 was abused sexually for four days at the Chernokozovo camp north of Grozny. Russian guards gang-raped a 16-year-old male and cut off his ear, and sawed off the teeth of another prisoner, who was left unable to speak, eat, or drink.</p> <p>In a rare interview with the western media, broadcast by ABC television in the US last night, Mr Putin said he would draw on ex-KGB colleagues for his presidential team and to launch a campaign against the endemic corruption.</p> <p>\"The right of ownership must become a priority in Russia,\" he said. We will strive to make the position of the state crystal clear in its legislation. We will need to make the state strong enough to guarantee implementation of these rights. I am bringing into my inner circle people from the law enforcement bodies who are in no way connected with the people and structures which may be associated with any form of corruption.\"</p> <p>\"I have known them for many years and I trust them. It has nothing to do with ideology. It's simply a matter of their professional qualities and personal relationships.\"</p> <p>The election is being held three months early because of Mr Yeltsin's sudden resignation at the end of December, and Mr Putin shows every sign of being in a hurry to cement his grip on power with a democratic mandate, not least because his rating in the polls, although way ahead of the other contenders at up to 60pc, is slipping.</p> <p>Given the fickle state of Russian public opinion, analysts say his popularity could fall as quickly as it rose.</p> <p>\"As acting head of state I had to organise the running of the country in this period,\" he said in his television address. \"I can consider that I've carried out my duty towards the constitution and the people of Russia at this stage . . . Despite all the difficulties as a result of the events in the north Caucasus and the actions of our army, society has been consolidated faced with the general danger. We have become stronger.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Vladimir Putin sought to exploit the advantages of incumbency and his perceived military conquest of Chechnya yesterday to secure an outright victory in tomorrow's Russian presidential election. The acting president, catapulted into the Kremlin by Boris Yeltsin at the New Year and expecting to win a four-year term in Russia's third direct election of the head of state, used an address to the nation to promise a Russia that will be stronger, more stable, and more prosperous under his rule. \"While our soldiers have been shedding blood in the north Caucasus, lies have been spread across the country and beyond its borders,\" he declared in the combative language that has become his trademark. \"Whoever has been using this against the state in this difficult time, and for whatever reason, they haven't succeeded. God will be their judge.\" Mr Putin, 47, is expected to be kept in the Kremlin by Russia's 108m voters, though it is not clear whether he will accomplish that tomorrow or be forced into a run-off in a fortnight. Yesterday's appeal to the electorate was aimed at ensuring a high turnout. At the end of a lacklustre campaign, Kremlin insiders fear that apathy, driven by the assumption that the result is a foregone conclusion, could prevent a first-round triumph. The last presidential election, in 1996, was a close-run contest between Mr Yeltsin and the communist leader, Gennady Zyuganov, which went to a second round. Expected to be the runner-up again this time, Mr Zyuganov is trailing 30 points behind Mr Putin in the opinion polls. But with 11 candidates on the ballot paper, Mr Putin needs half the votes cast to avoid a run-off, and the turn-out has to be 50% for the election to be valid. In the closing days of the campaign the state-run media, hugely instrumental in boosting Mr Putin's popularity, have been smearing Grigory Yavlinsky, the liberal democrat who is third in the polls, in an attempt to keep his vote low and improve Mr Putin's chances of a first round victory. \"The chances of Yavlinsky coming second are next to zero,\" said Boris Berezovsky, the billionaire Kremlin insider who co-owns the main state television channel and exploits it mercilessly to support his favourites and destroy his political opponents. \"Putin has serious support in the regions, and that's why he will win in the first round,\" he told a group of foreign journalists. \"I'll be voting for Putin, because Putin will continue with the reforms and he has the willpower to do it.\" Mr Putin's brutal military campaign against Chechnya has been the key to his rapid emergence from the bureaucratic facelessness of the Russian state, and yesterday he tapped into the sentiment of militarist nationalism that has characterised his nine months as prime minister and three months as acting president. \"We're not only electing a head of state, but also a commander in chief,\" he said, looking solemn and determined. \"Russia is one of the world's biggest states. And a mighty nuclear power. It's not only our friends who know this.\" His exploitation of the Chechen war coincided with further reports of Russian atrocities in Chechnya. Young girls and men were repeatedly gang-raped at a Russian detention camp in Chechnya, according to a former Chechen inmate quoted by Amnesty International.The former prisoner said a girl of 14 was abused sexually for four days at the Chernokozovo camp north of Grozny. Russian guards gang-raped a 16-year-old male and cut off his ear, and sawed off the teeth of another prisoner, who was left unable to speak, eat, or drink. In a rare interview with the western media, broadcast by ABC television in the US last night, Mr Putin said he would draw on ex-KGB colleagues for his presidential team and to launch a campaign against the endemic corruption. \"The right of ownership must become a priority in Russia,\" he said. We will strive to make the position of the state crystal clear in its legislation. We will need to make the state strong enough to guarantee implementation of these rights. I am bringing into my inner circle people from the law enforcement bodies who are in no way connected with the people and structures which may be associated with any form of corruption.\" \"I have known them for many years and I trust them. It has nothing to do with ideology. It's simply a matter of their professional qualities and personal relationships.\" The election is being held three months early because of Mr Yeltsin's sudden resignation at the end of December, and Mr Putin shows every sign of being in a hurry to cement his grip on power with a democratic mandate, not least because his rating in the polls, although way ahead of the other contenders at up to 60pc, is slipping. Given the fickle state of Russian public opinion, analysts say his popularity could fall as quickly as it rose. \"As acting head of state I had to organise the running of the country in this period,\" he said in his television address. \"I can consider that I've carried out my duty towards the constitution and the people of Russia at this stage . . . Despite all the difficulties as a result of the events in the north Caucasus and the actions of our army, society has been consolidated faced with the general danger. We have become stronger.\"",

      "trailText": "Should Tony Blair take paternity leave? Two differing views of the prime minister's dilemma",
      "byline": "Madeleine Bunting and  Paul Murphy",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>Madeleine Bunting: </b> Will he or won't he? Tony taking paternity leave has been elevated into a ridiculous test of his family-friendliness. There is now a stampede of people and newspapers rushing to establish their feminist credentials by urging him to take time off when his baby is born. What tokenistic purpose does it serve if he takes a week off in May? Let's be realistic: a new-born baby wants to do two things - sleep and feed. For neither of which is a father much use. Yes, he can change the odd nappy but it seems an entirely sensible delegation of responsibilities for a prime minister to hire a nanny to do that. <p>So can he do much for Cherie? Maybe and maybe not. It's entirely a matter for the Blairs and no larger political or ideological point can be made of their decision. Some women want their husbands standing around, spare-partish, looking on admiringly as they cope with leaking breast-pads, episiotomies, blood and physical wear and tear (literally) of childbirth. Many do not - and that has been true of thousands of cultures in human history. It is not just a matter of social conditioning for women to want to be cared for by women during and after having a baby. Besides they are good at it, and the perk is that it is often a time of extraordinary female solidarity. </p> <p>Unfortunately, like it or not (and I don't) there are few men who make good carers; for the most part, they lack the skills of empathic imagination and sensitivity. Caring for a woman post-partum requires patience, doing repetitive menial tasks and guessing before the thought has even formulated in her head what she might like: pillows plumping up, a hot bath running, a cup of tea or a bunch of flowers. Such skills, rare in men, are particularly rare in your average alpha male, where driven ambition tends to inhibit gentler characteristics. If Cherie decides a combination of her mother, daughter, sister, best friends and a good maternity nurse is what suits, who are we to criticise? </p> <p>If there was a demanding toddler to be reconciled to the new arrival, it might be a different story. Dad can be crucial in easing a small child over a huge adjustment. But that's not the case and teenagers don't suddenly want Dad hanging around. Anyway, Tony works from home. Remember, the mantra of family-friendly policy-making is flexibility. So he could cut back on a few meetings in late May and early June, and pop up to see Cherie and the kids more. That's better than giving up work altogether for a week to hang around eavesdropping on Gordon running cabinet meetings. </p> <p> Far more telling than what happens in May is what happens for the next 18 years and beyond. Just as important as the big headline events - birth, first day in school, nativity play, wedding - are all the dull Saturday afternoons when your child wants to build the thousandth Lego castle. The rainy day when they want to go to the park and be pushed on the swings. The dinosaur story which you are sick to death of but which fills your child with utter delight again... and again. Or those broken nights when a child is teething/has a nightmare/is worried about a school test. Or the cake they want to make which ends up all over the floor, walls and cooker. </p> <p>Is Tony Blair doing any of that? Well, he seems to do better than many, but, in the end, who knows? The inner workings of any family are beyond outside observers. Most of all when it happens to be one of the most famous families in the country. So let's leave the Blairs to get on with it, and puhleeze, no more of this hypocritical, holier than thou, tokenistic rubbish. </p> <p><b>Paul Murphy: </b> Some scenes never fade from the memory. It was four in the morning in our basement flat, way down in south-east London. A ludicrous American called Cassy Cassem seemed to be on the TV introducing a US chart-show and a tumbler of whisky was being kicked across the carpet by Lotte, our over-excited three-year-old, as she was launching herself off the sofa for the 25th time. I was completely shattered. </p> <p>Earlier, the room had been covered in polythene as Kate gave birth to our second child, Lili. Aside from the usual blood and guts and sweat and screams that come with childbirth (and which seemed to have been edited out of the sex education video when I was at school), the experience had been soft and close. We had another perfect little girl. </p> <p>My wife Kate, on the other hand, had a bit of a complication. She was still losing blood. The ambulance took two hours and a transfusion beckoned. </p> <p>So was I going straight back to work? No. The fact was I could hardly walk. </p> <p>Any father who suggests that becoming one is anything but a traumatic experience has probably had some sort of emotional bypass. But, yes, some do take a strange approach to the subject. Ahead of the arrival of Number One sprog, my departmental boss at the time (at another newspaper) informed me that I could take one week's holiday and then advised that I only take it after my wife had returned home from hospital, so as to be \"useful around the house at an important time\". </p> <p>I had been in a bad state after the birth of our first child, and so was Kate. I took the first week off, threw a sickie for the second, and by the third week was still far from fit to work. </p> <p>That was a decade ago. By the time Number Three sprog arrived, four years ago, a bit of compassionate leave was going to be taken whether the employer (the Guardian, by this time) agreed to it or not. </p> <p>It is not just a matter of lost kip or kissing goodbye to a social life. Tiny babies do indeed tend to sleep a lot for the first two or three months and the social life was always on the monkish side in any case. Instead, it is all about the emotional impact of two people producing a child. </p> <p>It is tremendous and traumatic at the same time. Children are humanising - little ones especially so. But it is not until they become bigger and much more costly and start whingeing and/or sulking in unison that the urge to escape to the office is triggered. </p> <p>For the government to start trying to legislate in anything but the barest terms for dealing with all this is plainly daft. All sensible employers should know that traumatised staff are not a lot of use in the workplace. They are an unproductive asset. Fathers need paternity leave simply because they are more than likely to be unfit for work. </p> <p>Some may need more leave than others and in the modern commercial world all employers have to be alive to the fact that, if they are not sensitive to the genuine needs of their staff, then they will soon end up with a second-rate workforce. </p> <p>The same goes for officers of the crown. For Tony Blair, however pressing are matters of state, surely knows that when his Number Four arrives he will not be in a fit mental state to concentrate on anything else. </p> <p>Just give the man a bit of time off. </p> <p>\u0095 Paul Murphy is the Guardian's financial editor.</p>",

Yes, he can change the odd nappy but it seems an entirely sensible delegation of responsibilities for a prime minister to hire a nanny to do that. So can he do much for Cherie? Maybe and maybe not. It's entirely a matter for the Blairs and no larger political or ideological point can be made of their decision. Some women want their husbands standing around, spare-partish, looking on admiringly as they cope with leaking breast-pads, episiotomies, blood and physical wear and tear (literally) of childbirth. Many do not - and that has been true of thousands of cultures in human history. It is not just a matter of social conditioning for women to want to be cared for by women during and after having a baby. Besides they are good at it, and the perk is that it is often a time of extraordinary female solidarity. Unfortunately, like it or not (and I don't) there are few men who make good carers; for the most part, they lack the skills of empathic imagination and sensitivity. Caring for a woman post-partum requires patience, doing repetitive menial tasks and guessing before the thought has even formulated in her head what she might like: pillows plumping up, a hot bath running, a cup of tea or a bunch of flowers. Such skills, rare in men, are particularly rare in your average alpha male, where driven ambition tends to inhibit gentler characteristics. If Cherie decides a combination of her mother, daughter, sister, best friends and a good maternity nurse is what suits, who are we to criticise? If there was a demanding toddler to be reconciled to the new arrival, it might be a different story. Dad can be crucial in easing a small child over a huge adjustment. But that's not the case and teenagers don't suddenly want Dad hanging around. Anyway, Tony works from home. Remember, the mantra of family-friendly policy-making is flexibility. So he could cut back on a few meetings in late May and early June, and pop up to see Cherie and the kids more. That's better than giving up work altogether for a week to hang around eavesdropping on Gordon running cabinet meetings. Far more telling than what happens in May is what happens for the next 18 years and beyond. Just as important as the big headline events - birth, first day in school, nativity play, wedding - are all the dull Saturday afternoons when your child wants to build the thousandth Lego castle. The rainy day when they want to go to the park and be pushed on the swings. The dinosaur story which you are sick to death of but which fills your child with utter delight again... and again. Or those broken nights when a child is teething/has a nightmare/is worried about a school test. Or the cake they want to make which ends up all over the floor, walls and cooker. Is Tony Blair doing any of that? Well, he seems to do better than many, but, in the end, who knows? The inner workings of any family are beyond outside observers. Most of all when it happens to be one of the most famous families in the country. So let's leave the Blairs to get on with it, and puhleeze, no more of this hypocritical, holier than thou, tokenistic rubbish. Paul Murphy: Some scenes never fade from the memory. It was four in the morning in our basement flat, way down in south-east London. A ludicrous American called Cassy Cassem seemed to be on the TV introducing a US chart-show and a tumbler of whisky was being kicked across the carpet by Lotte, our over-excited three-year-old, as she was launching herself off the sofa for the 25th time. I was completely shattered. Earlier, the room had been covered in polythene as Kate gave birth to our second child, Lili. Aside from the usual blood and guts and sweat and screams that come with childbirth (and which seemed to have been edited out of the sex education video when I was at school), the experience had been soft and close. We had another perfect little girl. My wife Kate, on the other hand, had a bit of a complication. She was still losing blood. The ambulance took two hours and a transfusion beckoned. So was I going straight back to work? No. The fact was I could hardly walk. Any father who suggests that becoming one is anything but a traumatic experience has probably had some sort of emotional bypass. But, yes, some do take a strange approach to the subject. Ahead of the arrival of Number One sprog, my departmental boss at the time (at another newspaper) informed me that I could take one week's holiday and then advised that I only take it after my wife had returned home from hospital, so as to be \"useful around the house at an important time\". I had been in a bad state after the birth of our first child, and so was Kate. I took the first week off, threw a sickie for the second, and by the third week was still far from fit to work. That was a decade ago. By the time Number Three sprog arrived, four years ago, a bit of compassionate leave was going to be taken whether the employer (the Guardian, by this time) agreed to it or not. It is not just a matter of lost kip or kissing goodbye to a social life. Tiny babies do indeed tend to sleep a lot for the first two or three months and the social life was always on the monkish side in any case. Instead, it is all about the emotional impact of two people producing a child. It is tremendous and traumatic at the same time. Children are humanising - little ones especially so. But it is not until they become bigger and much more costly and start whingeing and/or sulking in unison that the urge to escape to the office is triggered. For the government to start trying to legislate in anything but the barest terms for dealing with all this is plainly daft. All sensible employers should know that traumatised staff are not a lot of use in the workplace. They are an unproductive asset. Fathers need paternity leave simply because they are more than likely to be unfit for work. Some may need more leave than others and in the modern commercial world all employers have to be alive to the fact that, if they are not sensitive to the genuine needs of their staff, then they will soon end up with a second-rate workforce. The same goes for officers of the crown. For Tony Blair, however pressing are matters of state, surely knows that when his Number Four arrives he will not be in a fit mental state to concentrate on anything else. Just give the man a bit of time off. \u0095 Paul Murphy is the Guardian's financial editor.",

Peaceful negotiations between Beijing and Taipei could be \"a prolonged process\", said Li Jiaquan, a leading government thinktank expert on Taiwanese affairs quoted in the official China Daily. \"This process however should not go beyond 15 to 20 years since the de facto separation will jeopardise the reunification cause.\" This time frame is far longer than the one implied in Chinese threats before the election to take military action if reunification was delayed indefinitely. Mr Li described the situation as one of \"a timetable without a time limit\". The new hint of Chinese moderation coincided yesterday with the resignation of Taiwan's departing president, Lee Teng-hui, from his position as chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT) party. The KMT's central committee met under heavy guard after five days of violent demonstrations outside its headquarters by furious members who accused Mr Lee of betraying the party. Mr Lee is succeeded as chairman of the party by the current vice-president, Lien Chan, who came a bad third in last Saturday's election, losing votes to the ex-KMT independent candidate James Soong. \"The KMT's defeat forces us to face a cruel reality,\" Mr Lee - who initially resisted calls for his resignation - told the committee. \"The reasons behind this setback are various but as chairman I have to take full responsibility.\" Mr Lee, though leader of the party which formally opposes Taiwanese independence, enraged Beijing last year by announcing that China and Taiwan are two separate states. Chinese analysts on the mainland are now grappling with the paradox that Mr Chen, whose Democratic Progressive party has always campaigned for independence from China, may be more cautious than Mr Lee, whose party ruled the mainland until 1949 and more than once cooperated with the Chinese Communist party. The experts quoted yesterday in the China Daily made it clear that Beijing's open-ended timetable would not operate if Taiwan declared independence. In that case, said Mr Li, \"if force is adopted it may just be a matter of hours\". But Mr Chen has made it clear he has no intention of doing anything so foolish.

Another Chinese expert, Li Yihu, has suggested that better relations could begin with the opening of direct trade and other commercial links. \"They should first realise people-to-people contacts through economic and cultural exchanges and start direct trade, postal, air and shipping services, as a transitional means to bring them to the negotiation table,\" he was quoted as saying. The Taiwanese legislature started down this road earlier this week by approving links between Taiwanese offshore islands and the mainland. Mr Chen has said that he will extend the links in time to include the whole of Taiwan. Although Chinese experts do not always speak for the government, their opinions as quoted on the editorial page of the China Daily - on the most sensitive issue which Beijing now has to tackle - would have been carefully vetted. Some observers suggest that if a dialogue did develop with Mr Chen, Beijing could appease its own hardliners by presenting Mr Lee as the villain of the piece. Others warn that there is still a large gap between China's insistence that negotiations must be based on the \"principle of one China\" and Mr Chen's willingness to discuss \"one China\" as an issue, not a principle. It is also possible that Chinese hawks have chosen tactical silence while they await developments. They would be ready to pounce the moment Mr Chen put a foot wrong.",

When policemen are responsible for the violence, I dare say it's canteen culture. The Roma are not white. Their ancestors travelled from India. Many Roma communities have been settled for centuries as established minorities within countries that still don't accept them. Some are wealthy, most are not. When they move around, usually poverty and racial persecution have inspired them, not wanderlust and a copy of the Rough Guide to the Balkans. They have wonderful musicians. I say this only because one's claim to humanity in Britain is determined by whether or not the state recognises one's contribution to music, sport or catering. Above all, Roma are people. They are not a subspecies or a behavioural disorder. Pearson's defence would be that she writes about what she sees. That's the problem with so much journalism. If your life consists of flitting from keyboard to lunch to TV studio, you don't see anything much. You end up wittering about what you've eaten or watched on telly. And if you happen to cross humanity's path along the way, that's research. What a drag, though. You try not to have a world-view, but the world turns up on your doorstep.",

      "body": "<p>The playwright John Osborne once wrote of the imminent prospect of Britain sinking giggling into the sea. He should have lived a little longer; it is happening now. The increasingly dreadful farce of the London mayoralty campaign confirms what he predicted. As a contest, it is over already. Ken Livingstone has succeeded in building one of those rainbow coalitions about which he used to rave in Labour's darkest hours in the early 80s. </p> <p>At the core are people - a minority of his support, but quite a substantial minority - who genuinely believe in his project for London. Fanning out, in rainbow terms, towards red and violet, are many thousands of others who don't much interest themselves in what he stands for. They back him just to spite Blair; or, in even larger numbers, on the even more trivial basis that Ken is a bit of fun. </p> <p>In a chilling piece in the Observer, Andrew Rawnsley recorded conversations with City airheads of this persuasion. \"He's a character\" said a person in pensions. \"It'll be fun. Why not?\" The culmination of this infantilist politics is the mega-donation to which Livingstone was treated this week by Chris Evans, a man who has made himself famous and rich by being a loudmouthed buffoon. At first he offered \u00a3100,000. When Frank Dobson made some harmless jocular retort about not trusting redheads, Evans, pretending outrage at this odious slur on redheaded people, added a further \u00a3100,000. Now Virgin Radio, for which he performs, is in very deep trouble after Evans blurted out his support for Livingstone on its morning programme. It could face a heavy fine, or even have its licence truncated. I hope that happens. If you hire a shameless exhibitionist like Evans, that is what you deserve. </p> <p>\u0095 My fear that much of the world is going out of its mind are confirmed by the spate of \"rich lists\" which disfigure the Sunday papers. The Sunday Times, which invented the art form, had one last week in which Evans was listed as joint 439th, with an estimated \u00a373m. Who on earth reads this stuff?

      "bodyText": "The playwright John Osborne once wrote of the imminent prospect of Britain sinking giggling into the sea. He should have lived a little longer; it is happening now. The increasingly dreadful farce of the London mayoralty campaign confirms what he predicted. As a contest, it is over already. Ken Livingstone has succeeded in building one of those rainbow coalitions about which he used to rave in Labour's darkest hours in the early 80s. At the core are people - a minority of his support, but quite a substantial minority - who genuinely believe in his project for London. Fanning out, in rainbow terms, towards red and violet, are many thousands of others who don't much interest themselves in what he stands for. They back him just to spite Blair; or, in even larger numbers, on the even more trivial basis that Ken is a bit of fun. In a chilling piece in the Observer, Andrew Rawnsley recorded conversations with City airheads of this persuasion. \"He's a character\" said a person in pensions. \"It'll be fun. Why not?\" The culmination of this infantilist politics is the mega-donation to which Livingstone was treated this week by Chris Evans, a man who has made himself famous and rich by being a loudmouthed buffoon. At first he offered \u00a3100,000. When Frank Dobson made some harmless jocular retort about not trusting redheads, Evans, pretending outrage at this odious slur on redheaded people, added a further \u00a3100,000. Now Virgin Radio, for which he performs, is in very deep trouble after Evans blurted out his support for Livingstone on its morning programme. It could face a heavy fine, or even have its licence truncated. I hope that happens. If you hire a shameless exhibitionist like Evans, that is what you deserve. \u0095 My fear that much of the world is going out of its mind are confirmed by the spate of \"rich lists\" which disfigure the Sunday papers. The Sunday Times, which invented the art form, had one last week in which Evans was listed as joint 439th, with an estimated \u00a373m. Who on earth reads this stuff? Do car workers in Birmingham enthuse at the breakfast table as their industry crumbles about them over the news that Lukas Hoffman and Vera Oeri-Hoffman are the richest people in Europe and 12th richest in the whole world, equal with the Emir of Kuwait? Do pensioners eking out a meagre existence in Oldham rejoice to discover that Lady Juliet Tadgell, whose riches the Sunday Times ascribes to \"inheritance\", is joint 688th with no fewer than 41 others on \u00a345m? \"She has not been in the news much since her marriage to architectural historian Christopher Tadgell in 1997,\" a mini-profile of Tadgell oozes, \"but her wealth should easily have grown to \u00a345m.\" That \"should have\" reveals with commendable candour the essentially bogus nature of the operation.

      "bodyText": "In an ideal world the Kukri bar is everything Kosovo would want to be. There, ethnic hatred is forgotten. In the middle of Pristina, it recreates the atmosphere of a traditional English pub, the bar festooned with flags and British football team mementos. Albanians, Serbs, and Muslim Bosnians mingle over caffe lattes and Czech beer, with Elvis Presley crooning in the background. \"There is only one thing we won't tolerate in here,\" says John Foreman, the bar's English manager, \"and that is politics being discussed. Once people walk through these doors they cease to be Albanians, Serbs and Bosnians. They are simply customers having a good time.\" A year after the start of the Nato bombardment of Kosovo, Mr Foreman, a Sunderland-born former soldier, has become a legend in Pristina. To Serbs his presence is a ray of hope. \"The Kukri bar is the only multi-racial public space in all of Kosovo. If it didn't exist I'd have no life at all,\" says Diana Vasilic, 28, a Serb who works as an interpreter for K-For.

But the bar now runs the risk of becoming an example of everything that is wrong with the territory. In the eight months since it was opened by Mr Foreman's partner, a former officer in the Gurkha regiment, the Kukri has gradually fallen prey to the problems that threaten to tear the province apart: violence, organised crime, thuggery and intimidation. \"A lot of people don't agree with this bar,\" says Gezim Kasapoli, an ethnic Albanian. \"There's too much hate out there, there's the feeling that this sort of thing is far too early... that neither side is ready for it, although I feel that we eventually have to live together, which is why I am here.\" Mounting anger over the Kukri's existence has seen locals pelting clients with rotting rubbish from the balconies above, setting off tear gas canisters on the premises and issuing death threats to its staff.

      "bodyText": "Sanctions against the Serbian regime will remain in force as long as President Slobodan Milosevic is in power, the European Union vowed yesterday. In their toughest message yet to Belgrade, EU leaders, meeting in Lisbon on the first anniversary of the start of last year's war in Kosovo, made clear that there could be no place for an unreformed Serbia in a democratic Europe. Pledging to support the country's opposition, the EU appealed to the \"Serbian people to take their future into their own hands and reclaim their place in the family of democratic nations\". But Kosovo's continuing problems were dramatically underlined when the Nato secretary general, Lord Robertson, and the alliance's supreme commander in Europe, General Wesley Clark, abandoned a visit to the tense, ethnically divided town of Mitrovice. In Lisbon, EU leaders gave Javier Solana, the union's foreign policy supremo, and Chris Patten, the British commissioner for external relations, the mandate to jointly oversee Balkan policy, in an attempt to end its poor policy coordination and aid delivery. Earlier this week, the two reported that although resources and goodwill were plentiful, there was a lack of cohesion and excessive bureaucracy hampering efforts to help Kosovo and the front-line states around it. Diplomats freely admitted that the EU's performance in the Balkans has left it open to damaging criticism from the US, which largely paid for last year's Nato air campaign and now expects the alliance's European partners to do more to help build the peace. Tony Blair said as the summit ended: \"In my view, the problems of Kosovo today are real. The international community needs to have more vigour and focus and, since this is in our own backyard, Europe has to take the lead.\" He said the appointments of Mr Solana and Mr Patten \"will allow us to get a better grip on that situation\". Mr Patten, who controls billions of euros worth of EU aid to the Balkans, said later: \"All that is preventing Serbia from joining in our programmes in south-eastern Europe is Milosevic.\" The summit also agreed to open EU markets to products from Balkan countries, partially in response to recent criticism from Washington. An early test of the renewed commitment will come next week when the Balkan Stability Pact meets in Brussels, with renewed US pressure to deliver cash support for quick-start and medium-term infrastructure projects. In Pristina, meanwhile, officers in the Nato-led K-For peacekeeping force said the schedule for Gen Clark and Lord Robertson's visit had been changed at the last minute for \"operational reasons\". Violence in Mitrovice has been one of the biggest thorns in K-For's side since it moved into Kosovo last June. Any visit to Mitrovice, especially the Serb-dominated north of the city, would have raised major security concerns for two of the men most publicly associated with the bombing campaign. Earlier this week, EU foreign ministers endorsed plans to lift a ban on air links with Yugoslavia but tighten financial sanctions to increase pressure on President Milosevic. A visa ban on pro-Milosevic officials, business partners and cronies will be extended and their financial assets abroad will be frozen. Robin Cook, Britain's foreign secretary, defended the record so far. \"We have made more progress in getting refugees returned than we have yet managed to do in Bosnia,\" he said. EU leaders also pledged to provide direct financial aid to neighbouring Montenegro \"to ensure the survival of democratic government\" in the place which is widely considered the most likely to see the next stage in the wars of Yugoslav seccession. \u0095The US state department has urged its citizens living or travelling abroad to exercise appropriate caution and avoid large crowds or gatherings because of the possibility of pro-Serbian demonstrations in the run-up to first anniversary of the war in Kosovo.",

      "body": "<p>Occasionally referred to as Flash Gordon, Gordon Brown reinforced the link to his sci-fi namesake in last week's Budget with a provision to ease the tax burden on those who pilot the cars of the future.</p> <p>As part of his attempt to support environmental policy by using fiscal incentives, the chancellor is to reform the company car tax regime to place the greatest burden on those with the least environmentally friendly cars - as measured by their carbon dioxide emissions. The changes will take effect from April 6 2002 and include a specific reference to the \"significant environmental benefits\" of alternative fuels and technologies, such as cars that run on compressed natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas.</p> <p>However, since such green dream machines are not exactly speeding off the forecourts of dealerships yet, Mr Brown has also made changes to the rules that govern more conventional forms of transport. Under the new rules, company cars will be taxed on their price, but this figure will be graduated according to the level of carbon dioxide emitted by the car. The taxable value, on which the employee will pay income tax, will start at 15% of the price, with an additional 1% for every 5g/km above 165g/km the car produces.</p> <p>This is bad news for those who like to run expensive, sporty company cars.

      "bodyText": "Occasionally referred to as Flash Gordon, Gordon Brown reinforced the link to his sci-fi namesake in last week's Budget with a provision to ease the tax burden on those who pilot the cars of the future. As part of his attempt to support environmental policy by using fiscal incentives, the chancellor is to reform the company car tax regime to place the greatest burden on those with the least environmentally friendly cars - as measured by their carbon dioxide emissions. The changes will take effect from April 6 2002 and include a specific reference to the \"significant environmental benefits\" of alternative fuels and technologies, such as cars that run on compressed natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas. However, since such green dream machines are not exactly speeding off the forecourts of dealerships yet, Mr Brown has also made changes to the rules that govern more conventional forms of transport. Under the new rules, company cars will be taxed on their price, but this figure will be graduated according to the level of carbon dioxide emitted by the car. The taxable value, on which the employee will pay income tax, will start at 15% of the price, with an additional 1% for every 5g/km above 165g/km the car produces. This is bad news for those who like to run expensive, sporty company cars. An Audi A6 2.8 Quattro, for example, costs \u00a331,750 and emits 259g/km on average. The taxable value for this works out at \u00a310,731 a year, more than a third of the car's total price as new - very close to the current 35% maximum charge. A BMW 535i Sport costs \u00a339,595 and emits 282g/km which would mean a taxable value of \u00a315,204.48. But that would be the equivalent of 38.4% of the car's price so the bill would be reduced to \u00a313,858. The danger is that this may encourage those who know their car will take them over the 35% limit to go for something that emits even more, on the principle that you might as well be hanged for stealing a sheep as a lamb. A middle of the range Ford Focus, such as the 1.6 LX, comes in at a mere \u00a32,744 - only 20% of its price, thanks to emissions of only 188g/km, while the Fiesta 1.3 has a taxable value of \u00a31,162.50 because it emits only 161g/km. Low emissions are not enough, since the Ford car with the lowest carbon dioxide emissions, the Focus 1.8 four door saloon, does not fare so well because it is a diesel.

The Treasury feels such a tax advantage is unwarranted: \"Diesel cars emit greater quantities than petrol cars of the two local air pollutants of most concern (particulates and oxides of nitrogen), and are expected to continue to do so, even with the introduction of higher vehicle emission standards.\" So all cars that run entirely on diesel will incur a supplementary charge of 3% of the car's price. For the Focus 1.8 diesel, this brings the taxable value up to \u00a32,610. For cars registered before 1998, there are no reliable figures for carbon dioxide emissions so they will be taxed on a banded system based on engine capacity: 0-1400cc, 15%; 1,401-2,000cc, 22%; and 2,001cc or more, 32%.

In both cases, the capital gains tax bill becomes payable only when the VCT or EIS is eventually cashed in. VCTs and EISs are proving particularly popular with investors who have clocked up sizeable capital gains from other investments and can shelter these gains from the taxman by re-investing the proceeds in a VCT within 12 months of incurring a capital gain. Under new proposals investors can shelter capital gains within an EIS or VCT up to three years after the original gain. For example, an investor with a taxable gain of \u00a3100,000 from a previous investment can roll it into a VCT and defer up to \u00a340,000 until the shares are sold off after at least three years. The original \u00a340,000 gain then resurfaces, but any gains on the VCT itself are not liable to capital gains tax.

EIS schemes also allow investors to shelter chunkier capital gains as the investment limit is \u00a3150,000 per tax year, whereas maximum investment in VCTs is \u00a3100,000 per tax year. However, investors can invest up to \u00a3200,000 in VCTs by making use of the tax breaks straddling two tax years which, for administrative reasons, is not usually possible with EISs. Enterprise Investment Schemes cover a huge range of investment vehicles, ranging from specialist companies buying boats, children's nurseries and businesses such as film and television production, to simple portfolio services that buy new shares issued by companies on the Alternative Investment Market (Aim).

      "body": "<p>It's been a good week for savers. Hot on the heels of a successful first year for Individual Savings Accounts (Isas), the chancellor this week decided to extend the maximum investment limit of \u00a37,000 for a further year.</p> <p>This also means that the cash mini-Isa limit stays at \u00a33,000 for another year instead of dropping to \u00a31,000.</p> <p>He also confirmed that savings interest falling in the first \u00a31,520 of overall income will be subject to the lower 10% tax rate - a move which was first introduced in November's pre-Budget report with a limit of \u00a31,500 for last year and which is retrospective to last April.</p> <p>The extension of the \u00a37,000 limit on Isas, which were introduced by then-paymaster general Geoffrey Robinson, will be welcome news to those who find the tax-efficient nature of the accounts attractive. And while it's true that most of the extension's benefits are likely to be felt by the wealthier half of Isa investors, many financial advisers think it might be the start of a permanent extension of the limit.</p> <p>They expect the issue to be discussed when the government begins its review of Isas next month and hope the limit will be frozen or increased. Only time will tell if this will happen, but it's unlikely. Isas are aimed at the everyday saver and the assumption is that if the limit is too high, it will encourage the wealthy to use Isas as a way of avoiding capital gains tax.</p> <p>What seems more likely is a review of the structure of Isas. The split between minis and maxis and the restrictions on the number you can have, and who you can have them with, has confused people.</p> <p>In fact, many have already broken the rules, unwittingly taking out both mini and maxi Isas in the first year. Isa providers hope the government's response to this will not be too harsh.</p> <p>David Major, Isa consultant at Deloitte &amp; Touche said: \"It's hard to say what will happen. But given that consumers made mistakes because the rules were so complicated, the government will probably grant some sort of amnesty for the first year.\"</p> <p>Whatever happens, Isas appear to be a resounding success. Some 6.7m accounts, totalling \u00a317.3bn, were taken out in the first nine months.</p> <p>The accounts are basically split 50/50 between minis and maxis, with the stocks and shares and cash Isas far more popular than the lacklustre life insurance.</p> <p>Mini-Isa investors preferred cash, putting in a total of \u00a37.7bn, compared with \u00a3820m in stocks and shares. Maxi Isa investors preferred stocks and shares, investing \u00a38.2bn, compared with \u00a3500m in cash.</p> <p>Meanwhile, investors with savings in non-Isa products who have a low income should beware. Despite savings being included in the first \u00a31,520 of taxable income eligible for the lower 10% rate, banks and building societies deduct tax on savings at the basic rate at source.</p> <p>You must contact the Inland Revenue and claim the difference back. Unfortunately, the procedure can be daunting. Complicated forms put people off, especially if they are elderly, which the majority of the estimated 2.5m people eligible for the tax break are. For help, call the revenue's tax on savings hotline on 0845-307-5555.</p>",

This also means that the cash mini-Isa limit stays at \u00a33,000 for another year instead of dropping to \u00a31,000. He also confirmed that savings interest falling in the first \u00a31,520 of overall income will be subject to the lower 10% tax rate - a move which was first introduced in November's pre-Budget report with a limit of \u00a31,500 for last year and which is retrospective to last April. The extension of the \u00a37,000 limit on Isas, which were introduced by then-paymaster general Geoffrey Robinson, will be welcome news to those who find the tax-efficient nature of the accounts attractive. And while it's true that most of the extension's benefits are likely to be felt by the wealthier half of Isa investors, many financial advisers think it might be the start of a permanent extension of the limit. They expect the issue to be discussed when the government begins its review of Isas next month and hope the limit will be frozen or increased. Only time will tell if this will happen, but it's unlikely. Isas are aimed at the everyday saver and the assumption is that if the limit is too high, it will encourage the wealthy to use Isas as a way of avoiding capital gains tax. What seems more likely is a review of the structure of Isas. The split between minis and maxis and the restrictions on the number you can have, and who you can have them with, has confused people. In fact, many have already broken the rules, unwittingly taking out both mini and maxi Isas in the first year. Isa providers hope the government's response to this will not be too harsh. David Major, Isa consultant at Deloitte &amp; Touche said: \"It's hard to say what will happen. But given that consumers made mistakes because the rules were so complicated, the government will probably grant some sort of amnesty for the first year.\" Whatever happens, Isas appear to be a resounding success. Some 6.7m accounts, totalling \u00a317.3bn, were taken out in the first nine months. The accounts are basically split 50/50 between minis and maxis, with the stocks and shares and cash Isas far more popular than the lacklustre life insurance. Mini-Isa investors preferred cash, putting in a total of \u00a37.7bn, compared with \u00a3820m in stocks and shares. Maxi Isa investors preferred stocks and shares, investing \u00a38.2bn, compared with \u00a3500m in cash. Meanwhile, investors with savings in non-Isa products who have a low income should beware. Despite savings being included in the first \u00a31,520 of taxable income eligible for the lower 10% rate, banks and building societies deduct tax on savings at the basic rate at source. You must contact the Inland Revenue and claim the difference back. Unfortunately, the procedure can be daunting. Complicated forms put people off, especially if they are elderly, which the majority of the estimated 2.5m people eligible for the tax break are.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Film posters have shown some of the most startling price rises among collectibles during the past few years.</p> <p>They have been collected for around 20 years, mainly in the US. The most expensive movie poster of all time is for the 1931 film The Mummy, starring Boris Karloff, sold at auction for $450,00 (\u00a3285,000). Only two copies are known to be in existence.</p> <p>In the past five years film poster collecting has grown, encompassing those from ancient horror movies to cult films, celebrated directors like Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles to popular films like the James Bond series and the movies of stars like Clint Eastwood, Humphrey Bogart, Marilyn Monroe and Rita Hayworth.</p> <p>Tony Nourmand, who runs the Reel Poster Gallery in London's Notting Hill, is a consultant for Christie's, and has written several books on posters. He dates the upsurge in interest here from 1995 when Christie's started holding regular auctions of film posters.</p> <p>He says: \"Christie's has such a publicity machine, it created an awareness that film posters were available and made good decorations in the home. And they were cheap. I mean, if you want to buy a modern painting for your home you would probably need advice and you would probably need to spend several thousand pounds at least.</p> <p>\"With posters the impact is immediate. You know the minute you look at a poster whether you like it or not. A poster can usually be picked up for several hundred pounds or less.\"</p> <p>He likes to relate how the value of one James Bond poster has risen. In 1995 one for From Russia With Love could be bought for between \u00a350 and \u00a3100. Now it would cost you \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,500.</p> <p>Christie's is holding one of its annual poster sales on Monday, which gives a good idea of prices. It comprises 400 lots including James Bond and Alfred Hitchcock items and includes two private collections, one British and one American.</p> <p>Sarah Hodgson, the expert organising the sale, says that prices for some posters have risen sharply but some have not. \"There is stability in the market now; items usually sell within estimates.\"</p> <p>One of the most expensive pieces is from the British collection. This is a French version of the cult film Casablanca. It is expected to fetch between \u00a310,000 and \u00a315,000. But not all lots are this expensive. Prices are typically in the \u00a31,000 to \u00a32,000 range. The British collection contains a number of other classics. Citizen Kane is priced at \u00a31,200 to \u00a31,800, La Grande Illusion at \u00a33,000 to \u00a35,000 and La Dolce Vita has a \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,500 tag.</p> <p>The American collection is devoted to 37 posters of Clint Eastwood films. Clint started out in television in the western series Rawhide in the 50s and 60s, then became a big star as The Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. He became even bigger as maverick cop Dirty Harry before going on to direct his own films including Play Misty for Me, 1971, and Unforgiven, 1992.</p> <p>Gregory Ferland's Eastwood collection focuses on the Dirty Harry series and the spaghetti western trilogy. An original poster from the first spaghetti western, A Fistful of Dollars, 1964, is estimated to fetch between \u00a3600 to \u00a3900. An Italian poster for the second film, For A Few Dollars More could realise \u00a3800 to \u00a31,200. Prices for the Dirty Harry posters are similar. A US style 40 x 60in poster for Magnum Force, 1973, is priced at \u00a3700 to \u00a3900.</p> <p>But there are cheaper ones.

      "bodyText": "Film posters have shown some of the most startling price rises among collectibles during the past few years. They have been collected for around 20 years, mainly in the US. The most expensive movie poster of all time is for the 1931 film The Mummy, starring Boris Karloff, sold at auction for $450,00 (\u00a3285,000). Only two copies are known to be in existence. In the past five years film poster collecting has grown, encompassing those from ancient horror movies to cult films, celebrated directors like Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles to popular films like the James Bond series and the movies of stars like Clint Eastwood, Humphrey Bogart, Marilyn Monroe and Rita Hayworth. Tony Nourmand, who runs the Reel Poster Gallery in London's Notting Hill, is a consultant for Christie's, and has written several books on posters. He dates the upsurge in interest here from 1995 when Christie's started holding regular auctions of film posters. He says: \"Christie's has such a publicity machine, it created an awareness that film posters were available and made good decorations in the home. And they were cheap. I mean, if you want to buy a modern painting for your home you would probably need advice and you would probably need to spend several thousand pounds at least. \"With posters the impact is immediate. You know the minute you look at a poster whether you like it or not. A poster can usually be picked up for several hundred pounds or less.\" He likes to relate how the value of one James Bond poster has risen. In 1995 one for From Russia With Love could be bought for between \u00a350 and \u00a3100. Now it would cost you \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,500. Christie's is holding one of its annual poster sales on Monday, which gives a good idea of prices. It comprises 400 lots including James Bond and Alfred Hitchcock items and includes two private collections, one British and one American. Sarah Hodgson, the expert organising the sale, says that prices for some posters have risen sharply but some have not. \"There is stability in the market now; items usually sell within estimates.\" One of the most expensive pieces is from the British collection. This is a French version of the cult film Casablanca. It is expected to fetch between \u00a310,000 and \u00a315,000. But not all lots are this expensive. Prices are typically in the \u00a31,000 to \u00a32,000 range. The British collection contains a number of other classics. Citizen Kane is priced at \u00a31,200 to \u00a31,800, La Grande Illusion at \u00a33,000 to \u00a35,000 and La Dolce Vita has a \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,500 tag. The American collection is devoted to 37 posters of Clint Eastwood films. Clint started out in television in the western series Rawhide in the 50s and 60s, then became a big star as The Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. He became even bigger as maverick cop Dirty Harry before going on to direct his own films including Play Misty for Me, 1971, and Unforgiven, 1992. Gregory Ferland's Eastwood collection focuses on the Dirty Harry series and the spaghetti western trilogy. An original poster from the first spaghetti western, A Fistful of Dollars, 1964, is estimated to fetch between \u00a3600 to \u00a3900. An Italian poster for the second film, For A Few Dollars More could realise \u00a3800 to \u00a31,200. Prices for the Dirty Harry posters are similar. A US style 40 x 60in poster for Magnum Force, 1973, is priced at \u00a3700 to \u00a3900. But there are cheaper ones. A US second advance double-sided poster for Unforgiven, designed by Bill Gold, which won the Hollywood Reporter Key Art Award for best poster design, is estimated at \u00a380 to \u00a3120. There are bargains to be found. Elsewhere in the sale for fans of Woody Allen, there are US posters for Annie Hall, 1977 and Manhattan, 1979. They are both estimated at \u00a3250 to \u00a3400. Quentin Tarantino comes even cheaper: a poster for Pulp Fiction, 1994, is priced at \u00a3100 to \u00a3150. \u0095 For further information: visit www.christies.com or phone, 020-7581-7611; the Reel Poster Gallery 020-7727-4488, 72 Westbourne Grove, London W2 5SH.",

The basic premise is that you pay a premium to lock in the value of your capital, so that if markets fall you will not be left out of pocket. But in the middle of a raging bull market most investors decided that they are willing to take a risk in order to enjoy strong growth. According to the broker Torquil Clark, 46% of new money for Isa investments is going into technology trusts, compared with 2% this time last year. Most of it is being ploughed into the high-profile technology trusts. All this leaves the capital-protected Isas looking decidedly unloved. There are only three main players in the market at the moment: Scottish Widows, Edinburgh Fund Managers and HSBC. Close Brothers launched a protected fund four years ago but has no plans for a launch for this year's Isa season. It is not only unenthusiastic investors who have turned their back on these funds. Capital-protected funds have suffered because they are expensive to run. When setting up such a fund, the fund manager guards against loss by buying options, but as the FTSE indices continued to rise, options became more expensive. This has a knock-on effect on the cost of running the fund. John Churn of Torquil Clark said there were few protected funds now offered as part of an Isa. \"Investors are no longer interested in paying the extra cost involved to ensure that their capital is protected,\" he said. \"For example, B2 [part of Barclays] brought out their protected fund a year ago with a 6% charge.

When markets went higher, so too did the cost of protection - up to 14% at one time. But Mr Churn says the product could still be useful either for first-time investors who \"want to dip a couple of toes into the market\" or retired people who do not want to expose their capital to risk. There are other factors to bear in mind when you are deciding whether to buy a capital-protected product. Even though you are being asked to pay extra for the protected element of the fund, you will not be guaranteed to get all your money back if the markets fall spectacularly. The fund manager sets a protected price each year, and no matter what price you buy into the trust, the value of your assets will not fall below this level during the year. Say, for example, the protected price was 30p and you bought into the trust at 35p, but it then fell to 30p. The value of your assets in the first year would not have fallen below the initial price you paid for them. But when the protected price is reset the next year, it is set at 95% of the actual (market) price. This means that in the second year, the protected price will be 95% of 30p. If the market falls further in the second year, you could find that the value of your assets will actually fall below the price you paid for them. So what you are paying for is not full protection of your capital, but a limit if the market falls. On the plus side, fund managers will raise the protected price at the end of a good year, so that you can lock in the value of stock market returns. This is the case with the Scottish Widows SafetyPlus Isa and the Edinburgh Fund Managers' Safety First fund. The Edinburgh fund was launched in March 1996 investing mainly in UK blue chips.

      "body": "<p>Getting that first grown-up job offer is one of life's rites of passage. And like most other rites of passage it's exciting and new but generally not conducive to rational thought. The temptation is to accept the offer quickly before it's withdrawn.</p> <p>But the received wisdom is to take your time and have confidence in your ability. After all, given the current jobs market you could soon be faced with the virtuous dilemma of which of many offers to accept.</p> <p>So, before you jump into bed with the first offer that comes your way you should at least ask yourself the following questions.</p> <p><b> What's the salary?</b></p> <p>The obvious money question: more relevant perhaps when you're comparing two offers, but significant when evaluating just the one.</p> <p>Neil Harris, head of careers advice at University College London, tells students to return to human resource managers and ask them whether they're willing to match a better offer. \"It might work,\" he says, \"because once they've made the offer they don't want to go through the hassle of recruiting again. If it's reasonable it's going to get a reasonable consideration.\"</p> <p>If the job's right but the salary is wrong think about other benefits like share options, profit sharing, a pension scheme (not that tempting when you're just starting out) and a free travel card loan if you're working in London.</p> <p>A decent training scheme or accredited course can also be counted as salary because if it isn't offered you will need to pay for it yourself.</p> <p><b> What's it like to work there?</b></p> <p>For many, company culture is more important than salary. A graduate's first job is enough of a shock to the system without nefarious office politics ruining the day. Andrew Rogoff, editor at career advice and job vacancies website Inside Careers (<a href=\"http://www.insidecareers.co.uk)\" target=\"_NEW\">www.insidecareers.co.uk)</a> says you can do yourself a lot of favours on this score at the interview itself.</p> <p>\"Don't be afraid to ask about this; it's going to have an impact on your daily life. You should be asking questions like: how would you describe the company culture? Are there people there of my age group? Knowing the answers to these questions will improve your chances of really enjoying your work. You should also try to meet the people you will be working with on a daily basis.\"</p> <p>Another tip, says Neil Harris, is to check with the university alumni associations. \"If you can find anyone who went on to the same place or is working there now, they can tell you what it's like.</p> <p>\"Alternatively, it's how you felt when you were at the interview and how people treated you. Could you imagine yourself being there five days a week; could you picture yourself in the role? If you felt good vibes about the place that's often more important than the salary.\"</p> <p><b> What chance of promotion?</b></p> <p>More often than not your promotion chances are a function of the size of the company. \"Lots of small companies have good jobs and if they are expanding rapidly your career can expand at the same rate. You could be a director within five years,\" says Neil Harris.</p> <p>Larger companies tend to adopt the 'slowly but surely' approach but do provide opportunities to work in different departments and find a niche.</p> <p>Smaller companies also have an element of risk. \"The loss of a major customer could put them out of business,\" says Andrew Rogoff. \"Any dip in profits will also become apparent far more swiftly.\"</p> <p><b> My responsibilities?</b></p> <p>\"Make sure you have a clear understanding of your job responsibilities. Ask for written description that outlines these. Some time later this may provide you with leverage in negotiations if you have exceeded the requirements,\" says Andrew Rogoff.</p> <p><b> How is the company seen?</b></p> <p>You're bound to know someone working in the same or a related industry who will give you an opinion on your company. For more objective information you should look at the share price and the company accounts. You could even ring up an independent analyst if you've got some loose change burning a hole in your pocket. Finally, of course, make good use of the internet. Search the national newspaper archives for any stories that show your firm in a good or bad light.</p> <p><b> ... and finally</b></p> <p>\"Before you accept an offer try to make an honest assessment of your skills and what your objectives are,\" says Andrew Rogoff. \"Make sure the job will meet your expectations and that you can really handle it. Don't just accept an offer and see what happens.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Getting that first grown-up job offer is one of life's rites of passage. And like most other rites of passage it's exciting and new but generally not conducive to rational thought. The temptation is to accept the offer quickly before it's withdrawn. But the received wisdom is to take your time and have confidence in your ability. After all, given the current jobs market you could soon be faced with the virtuous dilemma of which of many offers to accept. So, before you jump into bed with the first offer that comes your way you should at least ask yourself the following questions. What's the salary? The obvious money question: more relevant perhaps when you're comparing two offers, but significant when evaluating just the one. Neil Harris, head of careers advice at University College London, tells students to return to human resource managers and ask them whether they're willing to match a better offer. \"It might work,\" he says, \"because once they've made the offer they don't want to go through the hassle of recruiting again. If it's reasonable it's going to get a reasonable consideration.\" If the job's right but the salary is wrong think about other benefits like share options, profit sharing, a pension scheme (not that tempting when you're just starting out) and a free travel card loan if you're working in London. A decent training scheme or accredited course can also be counted as salary because if it isn't offered you will need to pay for it yourself. What's it like to work there? For many, company culture is more important than salary. A graduate's first job is enough of a shock to the system without nefarious office politics ruining the day. Andrew Rogoff, editor at career advice and job vacancies website Inside Careers (www.insidecareers.co.uk) says you can do yourself a lot of favours on this score at the interview itself. \"Don't be afraid to ask about this; it's going to have an impact on your daily life. You should be asking questions like: how would you describe the company culture? Are there people there of my age group? Knowing the answers to these questions will improve your chances of really enjoying your work. You should also try to meet the people you will be working with on a daily basis.\" Another tip, says Neil Harris, is to check with the university alumni associations. \"If you can find anyone who went on to the same place or is working there now, they can tell you what it's like. \"Alternatively, it's how you felt when you were at the interview and how people treated you. Could you imagine yourself being there five days a week; could you picture yourself in the role? If you felt good vibes about the place that's often more important than the salary.\" What chance of promotion? More often than not your promotion chances are a function of the size of the company. \"Lots of small companies have good jobs and if they are expanding rapidly your career can expand at the same rate. You could be a director within five years,\" says Neil Harris. Larger companies tend to adopt the 'slowly but surely' approach but do provide opportunities to work in different departments and find a niche. Smaller companies also have an element of risk. \"The loss of a major customer could put them out of business,\" says Andrew Rogoff. \"Any dip in profits will also become apparent far more swiftly.\" My responsibilities? \"Make sure you have a clear understanding of your job responsibilities. Ask for written description that outlines these. Some time later this may provide you with leverage in negotiations if you have exceeded the requirements,\" says Andrew Rogoff. How is the company seen? You're bound to know someone working in the same or a related industry who will give you an opinion on your company. For more objective information you should look at the share price and the company accounts. You could even ring up an independent analyst if you've got some loose change burning a hole in your pocket. Finally, of course, make good use of the internet. Search the national newspaper archives for any stories that show your firm in a good or bad light. ... and finally \"Before you accept an offer try to make an honest assessment of your skills and what your objectives are,\" says Andrew Rogoff. \"Make sure the job will meet your expectations and that you can really handle it. Don't just accept an offer and see what happens.\"",

      "bodyText": "With the end of the tax year just over a week away, many investors are frantically trying to work out which Isa to invest in. A tracker fund can look like an easy option with no need to choose a particular sector, or active fund manager. They simply follow an index - anything from the Footsie to one in the far east - by buying all the shares in the list in their correct proportions. All the manager - or the computer - has to do is to rebalance the shares at regular intervals to ensure there is a minimum divergence. Investors may even be encouraged in the index tracker direction by the government's very own Cat standards for Isas, with their emphasis on low charges and fair terms. These favour the index funds due to their low costs. But recent changes in the FTSE have caused alarm. Internet and technology upstarts such as Freeserve, Baltimore Technologies and Psion have barged into the top 100 companies listed on the stock exchange, pushing out solid staples such as Whitbread, Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Imperial Tobacco. The biggest stock in the market, Vodafone AirTouch - accounts for nearly 15% of the entire FTSE-100. But tech stocks are notoriously volatile and first time stock market investors are considered most vulnerable. \"The reshuffle in the FTSE-100 has led to a concentration in the market which has fallen foul of the rules on risk control,\" says Jason Hollands of BEST Investments. \"It's no longer true that trackers are best for first-time buyers.\" So how have the companies that run FTSE-100 trackers responded? Have they warned investors or moved to protect them from the inevitable bursting of the technology bubble? The answer is that few plan to do much to increase investor awareness. Most point to the small print warning that the value can go down as well as up and argue that customers are well aware that trackers will follow the FTSE. Marks &amp; Spencer says it feels no need to warn of the recent developments. \"It's not the first time the FTSE has changed and it's still a good first entry point for an investor who wants a piece of the dot.com action without ignoring the more established players,\" says its spokesman, Richard Wheat. Fund managers also point to the need for investors to take a long-term view of the market. \"The key thing is that a tracker fund Isa is not an instant access account,\" says Chris Wermann, head of corporate affairs at Direct Line, which majors in the Isa tracker fund market. \"It should be bought as a medium-term investment, not a short-term one.\" He is also not particularly alarmed about the changes in the FTSE-100. \"The trend is still upwards and the heaviest weighting is not in internet stocks\" he says. Richard Carswell, managing director of NetISA agrees that there is little reason for alarm. \"Surely by buying into the FTSE you're spreading your risk among 100 companies, that's still a broad spread of risk. The downside is just as risky as the upside and just as easily as those tech stocks came in, they can go out.\" HSBC's head of investments and savings, Alan Gadd, is slightly more cautious. \"It's glib to say that things will pick up when the tech stocks fall out and other stocks come back in, because the increased level of activity adds a cost to the tracker which has to buy and sell stocks in line with the movement in the index. We don't want a regular repeat of what has been the biggest movement in and out of the FTSE-100 in its history; that would add to the cost of tracking.\" Meanwhile, NetISA has introduced ImmunISA, which allows investors to freeze their investment if they become worried that the stock market is about to fall. But Mr Carswell points to the importance of hanging on for the long term. \"Even when there have been big market falls in the past, the time when people have actively been selling is when they should have been buying. If they stick with it long enough, they should recover their investment and more.\"",

With many people holding upwards of \u00a350,000-worth, too much cash can be lost owning a Pep that is not doing exactly what you want.</p> <p>\"Most people have a Pep product that's inappropriate,\" says lan Millward, investment marketing manager with independent financial adviser Chase de Vere. \"Many people bought them as isolated decisions, so they may have them invested in one area, say UK growth, without diversification.\"</p> <p>Though you are not allowed to invest new money in a Pep, you can still switch your investments between different funds and managers. But relatively few Pep-holders are taking the chance to update their portfolios. Out of \u00a360bn still held in Peps, only \u00a31.5bn has been moved in the nine months since last April.</p> <p>So in reviewing your Pep portfolio, what questions should you be asking?</p> <p>First, consider whether your circumstances have changed. Are you looking for income funds now rather than growth funds? Do you have a good spread - geographically and in terms of fund management groups? \"If your Peps still meet your investment objectives then it's better to sit tight, particularly since you'll have to pay charges to move,\" Mr Millward says.</p> <p>Moving funds to another manager means you'll probably have to pay an initial charge, although many brokers will rebate all or some of the commission if you ask.</p> <p>Many providers - aware of the potential market - have introduced incentives to woo the Pep investor. Save &amp; Prosper is offering a 2% discount on its initial 5.5% charge for Peps of \u00a35,000 or over, moved into its Premier Equity Growth fund.</p> <p>Several discount brokers are also offering cheap deals.

      "bodyText": "Most personal equity plan holdings have been quietly forgotten amid the flurry of Isa excitement before the end of the tax year - the majority of owners hope they can be left to grow quietly until they can be cashed in at a profit. Yet now could be a good time to springclean your Peps. With many people holding upwards of \u00a350,000-worth, too much cash can be lost owning a Pep that is not doing exactly what you want. \"Most people have a Pep product that's inappropriate,\" says lan Millward, investment marketing manager with independent financial adviser Chase de Vere. \"Many people bought them as isolated decisions, so they may have them invested in one area, say UK growth, without diversification.\" Though you are not allowed to invest new money in a Pep, you can still switch your investments between different funds and managers. But relatively few Pep-holders are taking the chance to update their portfolios. Out of \u00a360bn still held in Peps, only \u00a31.5bn has been moved in the nine months since last April. So in reviewing your Pep portfolio, what questions should you be asking? First, consider whether your circumstances have changed. Are you looking for income funds now rather than growth funds? Do you have a good spread - geographically and in terms of fund management groups? \"If your Peps still meet your investment objectives then it's better to sit tight, particularly since you'll have to pay charges to move,\" Mr Millward says. Moving funds to another manager means you'll probably have to pay an initial charge, although many brokers will rebate all or some of the commission if you ask. Many providers - aware of the potential market - have introduced incentives to woo the Pep investor. Save &amp; Prosper is offering a 2% discount on its initial 5.5% charge for Peps of \u00a35,000 or over, moved into its Premier Equity Growth fund. Several discount brokers are also offering cheap deals. Financial Discounts Direct gives discounts from 3% to 5.25%, some of these eliminating the initial charge altogether. But there will probably be administration charges to start the new Pep. You may find your existing Pep provider imposes exit charges or transfer penalties. These can vary from 1% of total value up to 5% if you transfer in the first year. But whatever you do, don't be tempted to transfer to chase performance. \"The only time to move for those reasons is if your fund has performed really badly and consistently, and there's little likelihood of change,\" Mr Millward says.

For absolute peace of mind, cash Isa savers should look for accounts that carry the Cat standard. The Cat mark, however, does not guarantee that the products displaying it are the best on offer. The advantage of the government's Cat mark is that it makes it easy to find a cash Isa with no charges, which accepts deposits no greater than \u00a310, and is guaranteed to keep its interest payments close to base rate. The standards applying to cash Isas are: \u0095No penalty charges and minimum investment no more than \u00a310. \u0095Withdrawals to be processed within seven working days. \u0095Minimum interest no more than 2% below prevailing base rate. \u0095Rate increases to follow base rate rises within a month. The Cat stamp was introduced by the government so savers could identify straightforward Isas with low costs.

Self-select Isas are for people who want to hold high-growth or income stocks within a tax-free wrapper, or for those who want to hold more than one collective fund within their \u00a37,000 maxi allowance. They are popular among wealthy investors and higher-rate tax payers who want to shelter their gains from capital gains tax as well as income tax. Self-select Isas are not really for the beginner, who would be better off constructing a diversified portfolio based on investment or unit trusts. Holding a handful of stocks rather than a collective fund such as an investment or unit trust means that your Isa's fortunes rest on the performance of a small number of shares. Nevertheless, if you are a regular trader or have a knack of spotting growth shares, this can be to your advantage. You can shelter all your growth from capital gains tax if an equity is reinvested within an Isa. But you do have to sell the share and then repurchase it - an activity that could create a capital gains tax liability if your profit tops the personal CGT-free slice now standing at \u00a37,100.

      "body": "<b> Any links to that ancient settlement off the A3?</b> <p>None. Cobham Plc is based in Wimborne, Dorset. It designs and manufactures specialised equipment and components used by aerospace companies such as Airbus Industrie, Rolls-Royce and Boeing. </p> <p><b> When did it get off the ground?</b> </p> <p>Back in May 1927, Alan Cobham founded Alan Cobham Aviation Limited with offices in London's New Bond Street. The firm later set up Flight Refuelling Limited to develop air-to-air refuelling equipment and techniques that could be employed commercially. </p> <p>Today, using either (or both) the British probe and drogue method or the American boom system introduced by Boeing, the transfer of fuel in flight - the crucial link as foreseen by Sir Alan Cobham - is a commonplace feature undertaken by major air forces throughout the world. </p> <p><b> That explains the picture of a plane.</b> </p> <p>Its Flight Refuelling subsidiary with Intertechnique of France has been selected by Airbus Industrie to supply the fuel system for Airbus series 340-500/600 aircrafts. </p> <p><b> Is the Cobham family still involved in the firm?</b> </p> <p>In 1969, in his seventy-fifth year, Sir Alan relinquished the reins and handed over the role of chairman to his son, Michael, who, by then, was also managing director. There are no family members on the board at present, but Sir Michael Cobham owns around 7.3% of the stock. </p> <p><b> Any chance of a rundown of all its operations?</b> </p> <p>Cobham, which occupies a bewildering number of niche positions in defence and aerospace, began the new millennium with an order book worth \u00a31bn. This week it reported sales of \u00a3445.5m in 1999. </p> <p>Its Flight Refuelling subsidiary makes 1,400 components for Eurofighter. FR Aviation modernises older aircraft which are then used for electronic and photographic surveillance. Then there are its defence contracts. It also operates - via a joint venture with Bristow Helicopters - a school training military helicopter pilots. Cobham is bidding for the Ministry of Defence's biggest contract, worth as much as \u00a312bn, to operate a commercially driven in-flight refuelling tanker service. </p> <p><b> Are the details of its contracts top secret?</b> </p> <p>It is a major partner in the government's private finance initiative.

      "bodyText": "Any links to that ancient settlement off the A3? None. Cobham Plc is based in Wimborne, Dorset. It designs and manufactures specialised equipment and components used by aerospace companies such as Airbus Industrie, Rolls-Royce and Boeing. When did it get off the ground? Back in May 1927, Alan Cobham founded Alan Cobham Aviation Limited with offices in London's New Bond Street. The firm later set up Flight Refuelling Limited to develop air-to-air refuelling equipment and techniques that could be employed commercially. Today, using either (or both) the British probe and drogue method or the American boom system introduced by Boeing, the transfer of fuel in flight - the crucial link as foreseen by Sir Alan Cobham - is a commonplace feature undertaken by major air forces throughout the world. That explains the picture of a plane. Its Flight Refuelling subsidiary with Intertechnique of France has been selected by Airbus Industrie to supply the fuel system for Airbus series 340-500/600 aircrafts. Is the Cobham family still involved in the firm? In 1969, in his seventy-fifth year, Sir Alan relinquished the reins and handed over the role of chairman to his son, Michael, who, by then, was also managing director. There are no family members on the board at present, but Sir Michael Cobham owns around 7.3% of the stock. Any chance of a rundown of all its operations? Cobham, which occupies a bewildering number of niche positions in defence and aerospace, began the new millennium with an order book worth \u00a31bn. This week it reported sales of \u00a3445.5m in 1999. Its Flight Refuelling subsidiary makes 1,400 components for Eurofighter. FR Aviation modernises older aircraft which are then used for electronic and photographic surveillance. Then there are its defence contracts. It also operates - via a joint venture with Bristow Helicopters - a school training military helicopter pilots. Cobham is bidding for the Ministry of Defence's biggest contract, worth as much as \u00a312bn, to operate a commercially driven in-flight refuelling tanker service. Are the details of its contracts top secret? It is a major partner in the government's private finance initiative. Flight Refuelling has received orders totalling \u00a338.5m for equipment for the Euro-fighter programme. FR Aviation has put its electronic warfare training and target-towing business for the MoD on a firmer footing with a \u00a3250m contract. Other contracts won by its subsidiaries include \u00a310m for audio systems on German airforce transport aircraft and for protective covers for radar antennae on US Army helicopters. Gosh, market value must be sky high? After a profits riseof 9.6% to \u00a369.7m was declared this week, shares were trading at 810p, valuing the firm at \u00a3801m. Any chance of a foreign posting? Its Chelton group offshoot, which makes aerospace antennae, radio equipment, search and rescue systems and microwave components has now extended its facilities into South Africa. Conax Florida,its US subsidiary, is world leader in design and production of automatic life vest inflators and its pyrovalves are used in most satellites and space exploration flights. And its National Jet Systems, operates the Australian Customs Service's coastal surveillance programme. Does it have a foot in the new economy? It does, through Westwind which makes equipment to drill tiny holes in printed circuit boards and spindles for verification of computer discs. Its laser-drilling system allows customers to extend miniaturisation and power of circuit boards beyond the capability of current technology. I bet the bosses fly first class? Don't they all? Top boardroom salaries before bonuses and perks range from \u00a3218,250 to \u00a3342,000. Are the workers well looked after? Average pay among its 5,272 workforce works out at around \u00a325,455. Who fields the job applications? At present Flight Refuelling Limited, FR Aviation, Alan Cobham Engineering and Westwind Air Bearings, have a number of opportunities for modern apprenticeships in several engineering disciplines.

You won't get far with Tea With Mr Piffin or Let's Put A Stopper On The Hun. Seamy undersides are all the rage, especially if the overside of your underside isn't very pleasant either. Only one book a century gets away with the bright underside of the lovely overside. If life was that cheery, people wouldn't be reading books. They say you should write about what you know. Rubbish! This is a trick by publishers to stop stamp collectors getting their novels published - even though they have got snappy, one-word titles such as Unhinged. The great thing about fiction is that you can make it all up without doing a jot of research about anything. As long as you have one gratuitous fact per page, readers will think you know about nuclear fission/Iceland/micro-surgery. All novels these days must have long passages of gratuitous sex. These are very difficult to write if you've never had any gratuitous sex, let alone long passages of it. If you make it up, there's always the danger that you'll make some fundamental biological error that will embarrass you in print for ever. This is the only time when it's an advantage to have a short bald hero with the sexual magnetism of a face flannel.",

What is your idea of perfect happiness? A completed final page of a new book. What is your greatest fear? An unfinished book on deadline day. With which historical figure do you most identify? King Canute - I can't turn back the tide either, but I try. What has been your most embarrassing moment? Trying to remember the current ages, when asked, of my six daughters.

Being still a schoolboy at heart, pockets full of string, rubber bands and a mysterious object that sets off metal detectors at security barriers. Where would you like to live? In my windmill. How did you vote in the last election? I put a cross on the right piece of paper (all by myself). How will you vote in the next election? In the same way. I read all the candidates' literature and will vote for the one with positive policies rather than those who just attack their opponents. Should the Royal Family be scrapped? No, I don't think they have any recycling value. Do you believe in capital punishment? No, errors cannot be rectified. For what cause would you die? Euthanasia.

At least now I live in town with my ex-Spouse, his aunt and two teenagers, I can trust them to fend for themselves. There is an Indian take-away within a minute's walk - Rice in Urbis.</p> <p>Just before I leave, the phone rings. \"Hi, Dulcie, this is Jonathan.\" He who bought my cottage some months ago. \"Sorry to bother you, but we've got into a bit of a pickle with the septic tank.\" Feel the concepts of \"pickle\" and \"septic tank\" should be kept as far apart as possible, in the interests of future ploughman's lunches. Inform him briskly that the only firm equipped with a tanker small enough to negotiate the steep drive of Vile Cottage is Green Apple Sludge. Then escape via Virgin trains to Chesterfield.</p> <p>Disappointed that, despite Branson's entrepreneurial originality, Virgin employees are just the same old stewards in polyester blazers.

If I were a sewerage operative, my lorries would simply read: Poo-Gon.</p> <p>Although it lacks literary distinction. I can never come to the East Midlands without thinking of DH Lawrence. Wonder if Eastwood has been Heritaged yet. Perhaps it has a gift shop. Little snowstorm paperweights containing The Rainbow, perhaps. The Virgin and The Gipsy matching bathrobes. Gamekeeper Mellors' flexible wall-lights protruding saucily from plaques of buttoned tweed.</p> <p>Arrive at Chesterfield and am whisked by taxi along the roller-coaster of bypass, roundabout and howling chasm with which our handsome old towns are surrounded these days.

      "bodyText": "Prepare to go to Chesterfield to give a talk. I have often passed through it on the train and admired its left-leaning church spire - to match its left-leaning MP, the Mighty Benn. Wonder how long it will be before Tony Blair replaces the church spire with an obediently vertical one. Decide not to go by car, as I am having trouble with my shock absorbers. At least now I live in town with my ex-Spouse, his aunt and two teenagers, I can trust them to fend for themselves. There is an Indian take-away within a minute's walk - Rice in Urbis. Just before I leave, the phone rings. \"Hi, Dulcie, this is Jonathan.\" He who bought my cottage some months ago. \"Sorry to bother you, but we've got into a bit of a pickle with the septic tank.\" Feel the concepts of \"pickle\" and \"septic tank\" should be kept as far apart as possible, in the interests of future ploughman's lunches. Inform him briskly that the only firm equipped with a tanker small enough to negotiate the steep drive of Vile Cottage is Green Apple Sludge. Then escape via Virgin trains to Chesterfield. Disappointed that, despite Branson's entrepreneurial originality, Virgin employees are just the same old stewards in polyester blazers. As it's Virgin, why not a gipsy, wandering through the carriages offering tarot? Cannot get Green Apple Sludge out of my mind. In my experience, the one leads almost instantaneously to the other. If I were a sewerage operative, my lorries would simply read: Poo-Gon. Although it lacks literary distinction. I can never come to the East Midlands without thinking of DH Lawrence. Wonder if Eastwood has been Heritaged yet. Perhaps it has a gift shop. Little snowstorm paperweights containing The Rainbow, perhaps. The Virgin and The Gipsy matching bathrobes. Gamekeeper Mellors' flexible wall-lights protruding saucily from plaques of buttoned tweed. Arrive at Chesterfield and am whisked by taxi along the roller-coaster of bypass, roundabout and howling chasm with which our handsome old towns are surrounded these days. Glimpse crooked spire. \"It quivers above the town,\" whispers DH in my head, \"aroused by the heavy swell of the distant Peaks.\" They do say that the spire will finally straighten if a virgin is ever married there. \"Thanks, mah dook,\" says the taxi driver, depositing me at my hotel.

      "body": "<p>Crivvens! Granny always had a bag of treacle toffee about her. Real filling-pullers they were, too!\" \"Aye, but she made a braw treacle dumpling and great gingerbread.\"</p> <p>\"Aye, it was great stuff.\"</p> <p>Treacle: one of the most famous and recognisable tins of them all, its label ablaze with red and gold. And around the sides and lid lingered those familiar, pitch-black threads of the stickiest sugar substance ever - the inevitable result of trying to dig out two or three tablespoons too quickly.</p> <p>The blessed tin would sit quite contentedly in its apparently self-made black ring, which was always present regardless of how many times you tried to wipe it off. Might these same black tendrils - which seemed able to attach themselves with sticky vehemence to each and every item and surface within their vicinity - account for treacle's diminishing presence in the culinary world?</p> <p>Given our modern obsession with a sanitised household - not to mention an unhealthy dose of food-fad snobbery that has condemned it to the status of unfashionable - it would surely not be unreasonable to assume so.</p> <p>Yet why? Moist, sticky gingerbread; a rich, fruity suet steamed pudding; toffee; fudge - all require treacle to give them that significant, unique taste. Treacle, of course, is an ingredient that does not enjoy the stature of, say, olive oil, and it is most certainly not an integral part of a daily diet (healthy or otherwise), but it still holds a place in today's British culinary landscape - most notably in some of the best ham and bacon available in these isles: from Emmet's, the post office, haberdasher and grocery store in Peasenhall, Suffolk. There are a few other places around that still practise the art of curing in treacle, and all employ a different approach, but in essence they are the same, in that the cure consists of black treacle, sugar, salt and stout (on occasion, cider), which produces knockout bacons and hams that are among the best I have ever eaten.</p> <p>Now, molasses-cured produce sounds a lot more appealing than plain old treacle, but treacle is, in fact, the more refined of the two. Molasses is derived from crude left-overs. (The what's what in sugar refining - as in the correct naming of the different products that from the various processes involved - is quite bewildering. Molasses is the by-product of crushed sugar cane: the juices that seep out of the cane are boiled to make muscovado sugar. It seems that muscovado is the sole genuine article, and that other brown commercial varieties, to put it politely, only make up the numbers.)</p> <p>Pure molasses is, quite simply, inedible, yet during the refining process a molasses is produced that is palatable. Further refining produces treacle, and refined treacle renders Golden Syrup. This explains why treacle tart is still called treacle tart, even though there is no black treacle in this most famous, and most delicious, treacle pudding of them all. It's worth mentioning that, while white sugar is refined to such a degree that it has little or no flavour, the flavour of treacle is so pronounced that only a little need be used when making, say, an Irish treacle bread, which is just a soda bread enriched with treacle.</p> <p>Treacle is fairly simple, straightforward stuff, and it is also the only black foodstuff that does not wear an enormous price tag (unlike the truffle and caviar), so it should not be taken for granted. Otherwise, it might all too easily go the way of the dodo, along with many a worthy baker or cheese. After all, bacon cured in corn syrup does not fill me with inspiration, so I shall continue to do battle with the black ring on the shelf.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b>Sticky toffee pudding </b><br> If I remember correctly, this recipe was given me by Simon Hopkinson on his return from a visit to the great Sharrow Bay Hotel. I was just a pup at the time, employed cooking puddings at Bibendum, and this is, without doubt, the best version of that recipe I know. It's even better for having come from the horse's mouth, albeit secondhand. There is nothing like an original. </p> <p>65g unsalted butter<br> 170g soft dark brown sugar <br> 1 tsp baking powder <br> 225g plain flour <br> 1 very fresh egg <br> 170g dried dates <br> 284ml boiling water <br> 2 tbsp treacle <br> 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda <br> 1 tsp vanilla extract</p> <p>\u0095For the sauce</p> <p>200g soft dark brown sugar<br> 50g unsalted butter <br> 250ml whipping cream <br> 4-6 tbsp treacle</p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a loaf tin with silicon paper. Sift the flour with the baking powder. Stone and roughly chop the dates. Boil the water and treacle in a deep pot, then tip in the dates.</p> <p>In a mixing bowl, beat together the butter and sugar until soft and creamy. Drop the egg into this batter and beat well.</p> <p>Add the bicarbonate of soda to the boiling, treacly dates, and stir - be wary: an instantaneous reaction will take place, so don't stick your face too close to the top of the pan. Pour the contents of the pan on to those in the bowl, add the sifted flour and baking powder, along with the vanilla extract, and stir until it forms a smooth batter.</p> <p>Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until cooked through but still moist within. Let the cake cool in its tin, then slice it into thick pieces and lay these on a wire rack.</p> <p>Now, you're ready to make the sauce. In a big pot over a medium-low heat, mix together the sugar, cream and butter, then pour in the treacle. Mix until smooth and dark. Place a slice of pudding on each plate, then pour over a little sauce. Serve with whipped cream.</p> <p><b> Treacle tart </b> <br>The combination of lemon and spice, a fine match at any time, is excellent at allaying any excess sweetness from the treacle. <br><br> \u0095For the pastry</p> <p>227g plain flour <br> 20g icing sugar <br> 140g chilled unsalted butter <br> 1 egg yolk <br> 3 large tbsp ice-cold water</p> <p>\u0095For the filling</p> <p>1 lemon <br> 2 tbsp treacle <br> tsp ground cinnamon <br> 150g finely-chopped almonds <br> 400g golden syrup <br> 125g fresh white breadcrumbs <br> 2 very fresh eggs</p> <p>Sift the flour and icing sugar into a bowl. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the flour. Mix these together until you have a mixture the consistency of fine crumbs. Add the egg yolk and water, and work deftly until the dough comes together. Place the pastry on a board and knead lightly until well bound. Wrap in greaseproof paper and place in the fridge, preferably overnight.</p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 175C/350F/ gas mark 4. Line a 23cm or 25cm tart case with the pastry and return to the fridge for half an hour. Line the tart case with greaseproof paper, and fill with cooking shrapnel of some sort - rice, beans or somesuch - and bake for 15-20 minutes until the paper lifts out easily. Then finish baking the base.</p> <p>Now prepare the filling. Finely grate the zest from the lemon. In a bowl, mix together the treacle, cinnamon, almonds, syrup, breadcrumbs, eggs and lemon zest.</p> <p>Pour the filling mixture into the tart case, and return the whole lot to the oven. Reduce the temperature to the lowest setting possible (say 120C or gas mark ), and bake for 50 minutes to one hour. The tart is at its best when served warm with a spoonful of whipped cream.</p> <p><b> Treacle and chocolate fudge</b> <br>A charming old sweetie recipe. <br><br> 115g plain chocolate <br> 57g unsalted butter <br> 2 tbsp milk <br> 1 tsp vanilla extract <br> 1 tbsp treacle <br> 450g icing sugar, sifted</p> <p>Butter a Swiss roll tin (or small bread tin). Set a pan of water to simmer on the cooker. Sift the icing sugar into a small bowl. Break up the chocolate and butter into pieces and put them in a heat-proof bowl and, making sure that no liquid gets into the bowl, place it on top of the boiling pan of water.</p> <p>Once the chocolate and butter have melted, add the milk and vanilla. Add the treacle and then, a spoonful at a time, the icing sugar, beating all the while. Spread the mixture into the greased cake tin and smooth to ensure an even surface and thickness. Set the tray aside to cool, then place in the fridge. With a palette knife, tip out the set fudge in one piece and cut into cubes.</p> <p><b> Treacle cookies </b><br> <br> 125g unsalted butter <br> 2 tbsp treacle <br> 2 tbsp maple syrup <br> 225g plain flour <br> 1 pinch salt <br> 1 tsp ground ginger <br> 115g caster sugar <br> 1 egg yolk, beaten <br> tsp bicarbonate of soda, dissolved in 1 tbsp warm milk</p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 190C/375F/ gas mark 5. Melt the butter, treacle and maple syrup in a pan. Sift the flour, salt and ginger into a bowl, and mix in the sugar. Pour in the melted butter, treacle and syrup, then stir in the egg yolk.</p> <p>Add the bircarbonate of soda and milk mixture, and combine well. Place the resultant dough on to a surface and knead until the dough becomes smooth. Roll it out into a sausage shape, then wrap in tin foil. Put the foil package in the fridge.</p> <p>When you're ready to make your cookies, cut thin discs off the roll (the good thing is you don't need to make them all in one go, as the wrapped dough will keep well for a few days) and lay them on a baking sheet. Sprinkle a little sugar over the cookies, and bake for 15-20 minutes</p>",

      "bodyText": "Crivvens! Granny always had a bag of treacle toffee about her. Real filling-pullers they were, too!\" \"Aye, but she made a braw treacle dumpling and great gingerbread.\" \"Aye, it was great stuff.\" Treacle: one of the most famous and recognisable tins of them all, its label ablaze with red and gold. And around the sides and lid lingered those familiar, pitch-black threads of the stickiest sugar substance ever - the inevitable result of trying to dig out two or three tablespoons too quickly. The blessed tin would sit quite contentedly in its apparently self-made black ring, which was always present regardless of how many times you tried to wipe it off. Might these same black tendrils - which seemed able to attach themselves with sticky vehemence to each and every item and surface within their vicinity - account for treacle's diminishing presence in the culinary world? Given our modern obsession with a sanitised household - not to mention an unhealthy dose of food-fad snobbery that has condemned it to the status of unfashionable - it would surely not be unreasonable to assume so. Yet why? Moist, sticky gingerbread; a rich, fruity suet steamed pudding; toffee; fudge - all require treacle to give them that significant, unique taste. Treacle, of course, is an ingredient that does not enjoy the stature of, say, olive oil, and it is most certainly not an integral part of a daily diet (healthy or otherwise), but it still holds a place in today's British culinary landscape - most notably in some of the best ham and bacon available in these isles: from Emmet's, the post office, haberdasher and grocery store in Peasenhall, Suffolk. There are a few other places around that still practise the art of curing in treacle, and all employ a different approach, but in essence they are the same, in that the cure consists of black treacle, sugar, salt and stout (on occasion, cider), which produces knockout bacons and hams that are among the best I have ever eaten. Now, molasses-cured produce sounds a lot more appealing than plain old treacle, but treacle is, in fact, the more refined of the two. Molasses is derived from crude left-overs. (The what's what in sugar refining - as in the correct naming of the different products that from the various processes involved - is quite bewildering. Molasses is the by-product of crushed sugar cane: the juices that seep out of the cane are boiled to make muscovado sugar. It seems that muscovado is the sole genuine article, and that other brown commercial varieties, to put it politely, only make up the numbers.) Pure molasses is, quite simply, inedible, yet during the refining process a molasses is produced that is palatable. Further refining produces treacle, and refined treacle renders Golden Syrup. This explains why treacle tart is still called treacle tart, even though there is no black treacle in this most famous, and most delicious, treacle pudding of them all. It's worth mentioning that, while white sugar is refined to such a degree that it has little or no flavour, the flavour of treacle is so pronounced that only a little need be used when making, say, an Irish treacle bread, which is just a soda bread enriched with treacle. Treacle is fairly simple, straightforward stuff, and it is also the only black foodstuff that does not wear an enormous price tag (unlike the truffle and caviar), so it should not be taken for granted. Otherwise, it might all too easily go the way of the dodo, along with many a worthy baker or cheese. After all, bacon cured in corn syrup does not fill me with inspiration, so I shall continue to do battle with the black ring on the shelf. All recipes serve six. Sticky toffee pudding If I remember correctly, this recipe was given me by Simon Hopkinson on his return from a visit to the great Sharrow Bay Hotel. I was just a pup at the time, employed cooking puddings at Bibendum, and this is, without doubt, the best version of that recipe I know. It's even better for having come from the horse's mouth, albeit secondhand. There is nothing like an original. 65g unsalted butter 170g soft dark brown sugar 1 tsp baking powder 225g plain flour 1 very fresh egg 170g dried dates 284ml boiling water 2 tbsp treacle 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda 1 tsp vanilla extract \u0095For the sauce 200g soft dark brown sugar 50g unsalted butter 250ml whipping cream 4-6 tbsp treacle Pre-heat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a loaf tin with silicon paper. Sift the flour with the baking powder. Stone and roughly chop the dates. Boil the water and treacle in a deep pot, then tip in the dates. In a mixing bowl, beat together the butter and sugar until soft and creamy. Drop the egg into this batter and beat well. Add the bicarbonate of soda to the boiling, treacly dates, and stir - be wary: an instantaneous reaction will take place, so don't stick your face too close to the top of the pan. Pour the contents of the pan on to those in the bowl, add the sifted flour and baking powder, along with the vanilla extract, and stir until it forms a smooth batter. Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until cooked through but still moist within. Let the cake cool in its tin, then slice it into thick pieces and lay these on a wire rack. Now, you're ready to make the sauce. In a big pot over a medium-low heat, mix together the sugar, cream and butter, then pour in the treacle. Mix until smooth and dark. Place a slice of pudding on each plate, then pour over a little sauce. Serve with whipped cream. Treacle tart The combination of lemon and spice, a fine match at any time, is excellent at allaying any excess sweetness from the treacle. \u0095For the pastry 227g plain flour 20g icing sugar 140g chilled unsalted butter 1 egg yolk 3 large tbsp ice-cold water \u0095For the filling 1 lemon 2 tbsp treacle tsp ground cinnamon 150g finely-chopped almonds 400g golden syrup 125g fresh white breadcrumbs 2 very fresh eggs Sift the flour and icing sugar into a bowl. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the flour. Mix these together until you have a mixture the consistency of fine crumbs. Add the egg yolk and water, and work deftly until the dough comes together. Place the pastry on a board and knead lightly until well bound. Wrap in greaseproof paper and place in the fridge, preferably overnight. Pre-heat the oven to 175C/350F/ gas mark 4. Line a 23cm or 25cm tart case with the pastry and return to the fridge for half an hour. Line the tart case with greaseproof paper, and fill with cooking shrapnel of some sort - rice, beans or somesuch - and bake for 15-20 minutes until the paper lifts out easily. Then finish baking the base. Now prepare the filling. Finely grate the zest from the lemon. In a bowl, mix together the treacle, cinnamon, almonds, syrup, breadcrumbs, eggs and lemon zest. Pour the filling mixture into the tart case, and return the whole lot to the oven. Reduce the temperature to the lowest setting possible (say 120C or gas mark ), and bake for 50 minutes to one hour. The tart is at its best when served warm with a spoonful of whipped cream. Treacle and chocolate fudge A charming old sweetie recipe. 115g plain chocolate 57g unsalted butter 2 tbsp milk 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 tbsp treacle 450g icing sugar, sifted Butter a Swiss roll tin (or small bread tin). Set a pan of water to simmer on the cooker. Sift the icing sugar into a small bowl. Break up the chocolate and butter into pieces and put them in a heat-proof bowl and, making sure that no liquid gets into the bowl, place it on top of the boiling pan of water. Once the chocolate and butter have melted, add the milk and vanilla. Add the treacle and then, a spoonful at a time, the icing sugar, beating all the while. Spread the mixture into the greased cake tin and smooth to ensure an even surface and thickness. Set the tray aside to cool, then place in the fridge. With a palette knife, tip out the set fudge in one piece and cut into cubes. Treacle cookies 125g unsalted butter 2 tbsp treacle 2 tbsp maple syrup 225g plain flour 1 pinch salt 1 tsp ground ginger 115g caster sugar 1 egg yolk, beaten tsp bicarbonate of soda, dissolved in 1 tbsp warm milk Pre-heat the oven to 190C/375F/ gas mark 5. Melt the butter, treacle and maple syrup in a pan. Sift the flour, salt and ginger into a bowl, and mix in the sugar. Pour in the melted butter, treacle and syrup, then stir in the egg yolk. Add the bircarbonate of soda and milk mixture, and combine well. Place the resultant dough on to a surface and knead until the dough becomes smooth. Roll it out into a sausage shape, then wrap in tin foil. Put the foil package in the fridge. When you're ready to make your cookies, cut thin discs off the roll (the good thing is you don't need to make them all in one go, as the wrapped dough will keep well for a few days) and lay them on a baking sheet. Sprinkle a little sugar over the cookies, and bake for 15-20 minutes",

A true IPA should be only a shade darker than the Pilseners that it predated. Pale-ale brewing first became possible in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when coke replaced wood as the fuel that fired malt ovens or kilns. Wood fires made brown malt, which in turn produced brown beers. Coke was easier to control, and so produced a more even heat, which allowed maltsters to make a lighter-coloured malt that retained a much higher level of the enzymes that turn starch into fermentable sugar in the brewery.

Brewers were also driven by necessity: the great brewing centre of Burton had lost its substantial exports of brown beer to the Baltic during the Napoleonic wars, and urgently needed new overseas markets. When the town's brewers heard that a small London brewer named Hodgson had built up a successful business by sending a light-coloured \"India ale\" to Calcutta, they rushed to emulate him. Two of Burton's big brewers, Allsopp and Bass, were supported in this endeavour by the East India Company, which enjoyed a monopoly over trade with India at the time and encouraged them to undermine Hodgson, who had not paid his bills and was short-changing EIC agents. In 1821, Samuel Allsopp called in his head brewer, Job Goodhead, and asked him to reproduce Hodgson's ale. According to folklore, he mashed a trial brew in a large teapot, using a lightly kilned malt, and Burton was back in business. Within a decade, Allsopp and Bass were shipping some 6,000 barrels of pale ale a year to India, eclipsing Hodgson, whose brewery went into decline and eventual closure.</p> <p>We'll never know what Hodgson's original ale tasted like, but it would have been genuinely pale and heavily hopped, as the anti-bacterial properties of the hop would have helped keep the beer in good condition during the three-month sea journey to India. We know a lot about Burton beers, however, because records exist to this day. Burton pale ales are exceptional due to the remarkable properties of the spring waters of the Trent Valley. They are rich in salts, gypsum and magnesium, in particular, and play a vital role in brewing true pale ales - according to Paul Bayley, head brewer at Marston's, that other substantial Burton brewery, \"calcium sulphate [gypsum] reduces sugar and helps produce more alcohol.

Magnesium acts in a similar fashion, and sulphate gives a drier flavour and enhances bitterness.\"</p> <p>In the mid-90s, a genuine IPA was brewed for the White Horse, west London, whose manager, Mark Dorber, has a passion for the style and holds regular pale-ale festivals. He enlisted the help of Tom Dawson, a retired brewer with Bass, who used as his starting point a recipe for Bass Continental, which was brewed for the Belgian market between the 50s and 70s. It was based on old recipes for Bass ales of the 1850s, and so represented an unbroken line with the original IPAs. The new ale was brewed from 90% pale malt and 10% brewing sugar, with a massive addition of East Kent Goldings and Progress hops, using the Bass two-strain house yeast.

The keeper of this particular flame resides in the small Burton Bridge Brewery on the edge of town. Geoff Mumford and Bruce Wilkinson, ex-Ind Coope brewers both, fashion some wonderful beers in their tiny brewhouse, including an Empire pale ale that comes only in a bottle-fermented version.

It's the stuff of which empires were made . . . and lost Best of the rest Worthington White Shield A true Burton pale ale in bottle-fermented form, though it's now brewed in Horsham by King &amp; Barnes by agreement with Bass. Strong, fruity, hoppy, 5.6% and quenching. Deuchar's IPA Brewed by the Caledonian Brewery in Edinburgh, this is based on a Victorian recipe, when Old Reekie vied with Burton as the capital of pale ale brewing. At 3.8%, it's a pale ale rather than an IPA, but has a wonderfully well-balanced aroma and flavour of juicy malt, tart hops and citrus fruit. Viv Davies's IPA Brewed at the tiny Verulam Brewery in St Albans, this is 4%, making it a pale ale rather than an IPA, but it has a pungent, nose-tickling, grapefruity hoppiness from English Challenger.",

In The South Seas, by Robert Louis Stevenson? Or maybe half-formed visions of girls in grass skirts bringing breadfruit (whatever they are, as Philip Larkin asked in a poem more about sun-less life in England than sun, sea and frangipani)?</p> <p>Before I flew out to meet them last year, my vision of the South Seas was more half-baked than I could have imagined . I don't know why I had entertained the thought, even for a moment, that most of these islands would be somehow untouched by the world of air-conditioning, resort hotels, Japanese cars and local cultures tidied up for tourists on two-week packages for a bit of sun, fun, necklaces of flowers and breadfruit (unlike Larkin, I know what they are now).</p> <p>Silly, really, yet I suppose there are many such places we dream of and yet should never wake up to because they cannot possibly match the romantic vision of the mind's eye. Glenn Jowitt and Peter Shaw's Pacific Island Style, the latest in a long line of \"style\" books from Thames &amp; Hudson, presents a highly selective, if deliciously colourful view of the countless islands that form Oceania, most of which spring volcanically from the deep blue waters alive with fluorescent fish of the South Pacific.</p> <p>Here are the most delightful, though not always the most representative, houses, churches, huts and temples of Tahiti, New Caledonia, Samoa, the Cook Islands, Tonga, Fiji, Vanautu and the Solomon Islands. Each is a temptation away from Britain as the Easter holiday beckons, each promising a life of carefree, sunkissed beachcombing.</p> <p>Ah, to follow in the well-travelled footsteps of Stevenson and to settle, like him, on Samoa, in a romantic timber house, its walls lined with \"siapo\" (tapa cloth decorated with abstract inked patterns). Oh, to sail with Captain Cook, confidently labelling these far-flung islands New Ireland, New Caledonia and New Britain with imperial impunity. The South Seas aren't quite like this, though. The islands that still, for the most part, look undiscovered by foreigners from the air - rain-forest, volcanoes, coral reefs - were handed from one imperial power to the next in the 19th century, passed backwards and forwards like the tides of a tropical ocean.</p> <p>Take the Solomon Islands. These were \"discovered\" by the Spanish explorer Alvaro de Mendana de Neira, in 1586. He named them after the wise and fabulously rich biblical king in the belief that here be treasure (Jim, lad) and loads of it. The Solomons were later taken over by the British, Dutch, French and, in 1942, invaded by the Japanese. The British stepped in again and these volcanic islands draped in lush rainforest were finally given back their independence in 1978.</p> <p>Each culture has made something of a mark, although all that is solid truly melts into the air in these parts. Hurricanes blow huts away. Termites gnaw incessantly into the structure of homes with walls of bamboo, sago palm and thatched reeds. They respect the memorials of neither Spanish nor British, Dutch nor French. Even if there are no wood-boring bugs, the deep humidity undermines man's best efforts to make architecture last.</p> <p>Pacific Style paints a lush picture of these islands as if this was the land of the lotus-eaters, where everyone's hair is garlanded with frangipani, lilies and bougainvillaea. While the beauty of the natural resources is reflected in the colours found in some of even the humblest homes, the real story is more complex - although there are, for example, wonderful hairy huts hidden in the dense foliage that faces the east coast of New Caledonia, much of the island is taken up by French ranches with their horrid, air-conditioned houses set behind high gates and security cameras, vast nickel mines that rip through the mountains like a serrated knife, right-wing politics and a capital city that, while not unpleasant, is like a low-rent Cannes.</p> <p>I was introduced to many Kanak Indians, the indigenous people of what the French like to call Nouvelle Caledonie, and learned that many young people here prefer imported reggae from the distant West Indies to their own native music. Pacific style was not quite as books such as Jowitt and Shaw's present it. The beautiful witches'-hat huts shown in Pacific Style belong either to museums or are considered to be museum pieces in villages and towns that reminded me as much of the West Indies as they are meant to say South Pacific. In enticing picture books, that is.</p> <p>The finest building to contain, evoke and nurture Kanak culture is not, in any case, a colourful thatched hut, but the superb Centre Culturel Jean Tibajhou, set on the banks of a magnificent bay that is a crowded, bouncy, 40-minute bus ride from Noumea. This gathering of 10 extraordinary modern timber huts is a place for the Kanaks to celebrate their culture. It was designed by Renzo Piano's Building Workshop (Paris and Genoa) and, opened at the end of 1998, is the last of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand's \" grands projets \".</p> <p>It also represents - despite its beauty and the sincerity with which it has been designed, built and curated - the last vestiges of French imperialism in the South Pacific. Nouvelle Caldedonie is to remain in French hands until 2015 at least. Nickel aside, the island represents cheap holidays in the sun for the French and tax-free jobs in the civil service, military and diplomatic corps. It is also a key link in the round-the-world chain of French nuclear or nuclear-support bases. Significantly, the politically-loaded cultural centre is absent from Jowitt and Shaw's book. This is sad, giving a skewed vision of what modern buildings are like on the islands.</p> <p>Not so many hundreds of miles away from Noumea is Raratonga, the largest of the Cook Islands. At first, I thought I'd landed in suburban Auckland instead. The local people I met talked with New Zealand accents. They dreamed of air-conditioned bungalows rather than the beautiful traditional huts (beloved of termites, hurricanes and humidity) with their steep roofs, deep eaves and walls of sago palms sewn together with vines. Most of the houses I saw and visited were made of breeze-blocks and topped with corrugated tin roofs. True, they smelt of fresh-scented flowers and were often draped in the most gloriously colourful throws and bedspreads; yet walls were as likely to be adorned with calendars from travel agents and posters of soap stars as with the superb traditional carvings that tend to end up in galleries that sell to wealthy tourists. True, these can be seen in Jowitt and Shaw's book, but it was much harder work than I imagined to capture the real spirit of Pacific Island Style they purport to offer.</p> <p>Their eye, and this is not a criticism, has been highly selective. Who can blame them? We want to believe in images of unspoiled Oceanic homes as much as we do of quaint Cotswold or Gascony villages. Yes, there are moments of exquisite poverty - I mean, picturesque ways of life - in this constellation of islands, where you can find rough-hewn houses squatting on poles in the sea, or locals gathered in smoky huts looking exactly as photographers hope to find them. But this is rare, and only on the really distant islands, some of which are connected to one another by boats that sail once a month at most.</p> <p>I flew to Mangaia, one of the least-visited of the Cook Islands in the group closest to Raratonga. The idyll - a straw hut to sleep in, fresh flowers, a boat to sail, underwater caves to explore, local people singing for me in the evening - was made possible by a Swedish electrical engineer who had settled here 20 years ago when he abandoned his round-the-world yacht and settled down with a local girl. What he has created is his own vision of the South Seas or Pacific Island Style. Many local people (well, not that many: there are fewer than 700 people on the island) have fallen in with his dream of their homeland. Others continue to leave for New Zealand, with its promise of a decent education, a high standard of living, air-con and 24-hour rugby.</p> <p>I asked a travel agent in Raratonga where I might stay in Tahiti and the Frenchified islands that surround it, and was shown brochure after brochure of the kind of resort that you can find anywhere in the West Indies or Mediterranean. Shiny places for shiny people in skimpy swimwear and in search of suntans and meals served by smiling natives who earn in a month what the shiny people shove down their throats in less than an hour.</p> <p>Pacific Island Style is a lovely dream, and one that many of us would like to share. But with globalisation rushing in on all sides of us, for better or worse, and faster than Pacific breakers, how can we, let alone Glenn Jowitt and Peter Shaw, hang on to the dream?</p>",

She must have been a weird kid, one of those brooding isolates with an unnaturally high IQ who read Virgil for pleasure. So far as she was concerned, sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt entirely defined her passion. It was a high-minded kind of love. One day, her father went into her room and saw her pin-up. \"Why?\" he asked. \"Why him?\" </p> <p>She didn't answer, of course, so he had to work it out for himself. He stared long and hard into the double-Janus face and drew his own conclusion. He made a sound like the dull thud of a penny dropping and slowly walked away. It wasn't mentioned again. </p> <p>Jane has retained her admiration for Aznavour along with all his old albums. She insists he is a gypsy. A real gypsy. She says that you can hear it in his voice and in the words of the songs he sings. And so you can. Which is not to say his is like any other voice, gypsy or otherwise; more, it is the inimitable, unmistakable sound of a man who has found his own voice from the place inside himself he has his highest hopes of and allows it to sing for him. A one-off voice. Not too many men, in or out of showbusiness, are ever that bold about themselves. They come and go in trendy clutches, safe as houses. They sound good, bad or indifferent, but invariably similar to each other. If it does it for you, it does it for most people at the same time, but it doesn't last. Timidity attracts timidity is why. Heart-throbs are replaceable. It's like serial monogamy: the sex part doesn't sustain a lifetime because it wasn't brave enough to come from the heart in the first place. </p> <p>When you get in there amongst it, into the narrative themes of Aznavour's particular romanticism - the love, life, memory, guilt, remorse, loss, infidelity, disappointment, pain and longing of it all - you find there is nothing meretricious in the full-orchestral, carousel-crescendant enormity of their dramatisation; that these are only rather subtly appropriate. And timeless. </p> <p>On this his 66th year in showbusiness, Charles Aznavour is in England for the staging of his musical, Lautrec. He's in the lobby of a hotel neighbouring Harrods, drinking green tea and wearing - how chic - the ribbon slivers of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur in his lapel. He is talking with the producer of his show about the latest sighting of the English translator of his songs, and Aznavour - this exquisitely elegant, delicately-built man with a lightly unpretentious French accent - suddenly transforms himself into a large, lumbering, blunt-faced South African. I had no idea he did impressions, but I knew Herbie Kretzmer before he became a lyricist, and this one was spot on. If it had been a guessing game, I'd have won first prize. </p> <p>He does this a lot; just turns into the person he's talking about. \"This is my father,\" for instance, expanding backwards in his seat, imaginary glass in one hand, fag in the other, head at a rakish angle, body open to the world; a man of infinite gaiety, hope, fecklessness and invention. Say no more. He was a Russian Armenian, his papa, bred to sing and dance and drink and eat the glass afterwards, hoick, crunch, chew it up, swallow it! Something to do with being on the qui vive for murderers; if you get used to chomping up the odd tumbler, you'll be immune to powdered glass when they put it in your dinner. He used to go out to buy food, spend all the money on ludicrous delicacies and come home without bread, then go out again, pick up a stranger on the street and invite him home for lunch for the price of a family-sized baguette. </p> <p>And this is his sister, close to him as two fingers all their lives, who still attends his recordings and screws up her face like a Brussels sprout when she fancies she hears a bum note. \"Who are you this morning?\" she'd ask with sisterly concern for the size of his head. \"Charles or Aznavour?\" He could rely on her to tell him that an ability to do a tidy two-step didn't make him Fred Astaire. </p> <p>Then his mother, sad, sweet and child-sized, sewing, by lamplight until the oil ran out, who wept silently for her family slaughtered, every one of them, by the Turks in Armenia. Nothing was ever said - he just grew up knowing his tiny mother had experienced unspeakable, horrific things and that somehow she had survived them. \"I have that tragedy in my blood,\" he says with not unwarranted solemnity. \"And the blood became eeeenk.\" </p> <p>But bitter? Why should he be bitter? His mother had him in the Free Hospital in Paris and took him home to a 25 square-metreroom, with no water, no electricity and five people living, sleeping and eating in it. \"And from there I am here,\" he says. \"Why do I have to be bitter?\" </p> <p>There's an old racist joke about Armenians, doubtless originated in the years between the two world wars when Aznavour was a boy. It takes 10 men, it goes, to catch a Jew and 10 Jews to catch an Armenian. According to Aznavour, I've missed out a large chunk in the middle; 10 Russians, 10 Greeks, 10 Italians, 10 Hungarians and so on and so forth - 10 of everyone from each nation represented in the Paris community of \u00e9migr\u00e9s where he began his life. Whatever the order of precedence, the Armenian always came last. Perhaps because an Armenian thought it up. </p> <p>But if Armenians were singular, the Aznavour family were singularly singular, the sort of people other Armenians showed the finger to. The poor kids, they said, they'll be lost, lost. Why can't you become a tailor, a tailor is beautiful. Or a shoe-maker. Be sensible. Be safe. But no, from as far back as he can remember, Charles and his sister were destined for showbusiness, whatever that was. Their father came roaring home at all hours accompanied by his latest collection of roisterers, the piano lid would go up and there, they'd be singing and dancing the night away. That was normality. And never, ever, not once in his entire childhood, was he ever told to go to sleep. His mother reasoned that after two sleepless nights a child would go to school half-awake, but on the third night sleep like a baby. And she was right about that. Meanwhile, both her children innocently imbibed an international culture of merry-making like it was going out of style. Which, of course, it was. And now it has gone. Aznavour has it for himself, but his children do not. He has lost, he says, his father's ability to pass on his background. \"The sense of loss is in my genes,\" says Aznavour. Coming from someone else, it might sound portentous. </p> <p>At the age of nine, the boy Charles wrote to the Children's Theatre in Paris for an audition. He was a dancer, he assured them. A Russian dancer. They watched him bobbing up and down on his haunches, kicking his little legs out like billy-o, and gave him the job. It was his first professional contract. He went on dancing the Gopek until about 10 years ago, when he was feeling particularly high spirited at a friend's 85th birthday party in St Tropez. The surgery on his knee was long and complicated, and he hasn't done it since. Following his dancing stardom, he became an actor, taking parts in four, five plays before auditioning, aged 10, as a night-club singer. He got the job. </p> <p>These 65 years on, he appears not to be about to remember what he sang. Except, whatever it was, it was pretty terrible. He wrote it himself and no, no, he doesn't remember. Except it was called Santa Claus Is Jazzy, if I must know. Then, wait a minute, there's another one, something about there being birds in the tower. No, bats in the belfry. \"You're nuts.\" That was definitely terrible. But he sang his songs anyway and people clapped and he earned money to take home. He even bought his father a stall in the flea market, so he could sell junk. Not that they thought it was junk at time. They thought they were dealing in beautiful antiques. </p> <p>At all events, Charles Aznavour was a professional singer at 10 and upon mature reflection counts himself the first existential singer in France on account of not owning a suit and being therefore obliged to perform barefoot with trousers sewn by a cousin and a sweatshirt the colour - this he remembers particularly - of fading Bordeaux. He teamed up with an older boy, who wrote tunes for his lyrics and, at the age of 16, presented his portfolio to a publishing company. He couldn't play the piano in those days, just a few dramatic chords, but he struck them anyway with rather more panache than skill, crash, crash, crash, till the chandelier in the centre of the publisher's ceiling fell down, boom, and shattered all over the floor. They didn't buy his songs, of course, but they let him sweep up the chandelier and told him they found him, you know, interesting . </p> <p>By the time the German army occupied Paris, Charles was earning enough to branch out into a brief career as a sort of Resistance spiv. He bought up the sad scrappings of a defunct chocolate factory and became the owner of the only collection of boxed chocolates in Europe. They turned out to be a truly awful confection, cheap and nasty with paper-thin chocolate and saccharine centres, so he'd take them to where the German trucks were parked and sell them to the German soldiers. Then run like the wind. His trade in fake silk stockings was easier. You put your hand in them and sccccrttt, ladders everywhere. Only they wouldn't know that until they'd sent them to their wives. </p> <p>He was equally sanguine about the tasks he undertook for his parents, which mostly consisted of getting rid of German uniforms taken from Russian and Armenian conscripts to the German army. His mother found them civilian clothes, and helped hide or send them on their way, a small Resistance contribution Charles never felt was dangerous because nobody ever suggested it might be. Hence, when he found a pair of German jackboots that fitted him, he kept them. He even wore them to work, which slightly altered the existential image and might conceivably have contributed to a modest shoe fetish that persists to this day. \"Look here,\" he says, producing an impeccably black-calf-shod foot from under the table. \"Brand new! I bought these 15 years ago, and this is their first outing. I hoard shoes. Buy 20 pairs at a time and hoard them.\" He visits his shoes on a regular basis. Scans the array: shall he, shan't he treat himself to a pristine pair today? It can be quite a little struggle. Not today, maybe next time. Save them up. And, like Wagner in pursuit of a leitmotif, he concludes, \"It is peculiar .\" </p> <p>When we rather nervously embark upon the obligatory quest for the wit and wisdom of a man with a world-class romantic reputation, Aznavour is instantly up-front and undefended. It is already clear that he has enjoyed certain fundamental psychological advantages in his life. His father manifestly loved his mother, for one thing, and for another he made a lifelong friend of his sister. Not only is he not afraid of women, he comes across as one of those rare male creatures who actually likes them so much that he doesn't feel macho-honourbound to arse about with meaningful eye contact and body language. He just is , which is probably about as sexy as a man can be. </p> <p>His sexual history, while long and exotic, has led him to an uxorious plateau, 36 years wide, in which he grazes like a complacent stag. It has been, he says, a learning process, which sentiment he has long since immortalised in the somewhat daunting lyric \"You've got to learn to leave the table/When love is no longer served.\" It has not been an easy study. He has been married three times, which makes two divorces. He thought he would be in love forever and, bingo, he wasn't. So this is what he did: up to the mouth goes the hand holding an imaginary toothbrush, out goes the other hand relinquishing an imaginary key. It's over. Leave everything behind, pay up and do not complain. </p> <p>\"I have paid for my freedom,\" he says, and you could almost imagine he doesn't begrudge a centime of it. His second wife was a difficult woman to leave. Mainly because she wasn't the sort of girl a man would walk out on. She was beautiful, she was strong, she was wonderfully flashy. He was, by this time, noticeably successful, and maybe what he thought was love was merely his vanity awarding itself a status symbol. Unfortunately, for the pair of them, she seems to have been beset by a sort of complementary vanity of her own, in that she threw herself into a programme of ruthless aggrandisement of her husband. She filled their life with influential people and expected him to promote himself with tales of his latest triumph and bore on about his work, than which activity he'd as soon have stuck bodkins in his eyes. </p> <p>Toothbrush time came round again and, God knows, he tried to be stoical. In the end, he took the coward's way out, waited for her to go away for a weekend, packed his bag and left. It was getting to be a habit. Whenever romance palled, he'd wait until he was about to go on tour, wave goodbye and never come back. The only way to ameliorate the guilt was to pay up like a sugar-daddy. Once, in Brazil, there was a lovely girl. They planned a romantic holiday together and were all set to go when disenchantment set in. He bought a big, beautiful yellow Lancia for the trip and she was so thrilled with it she didn't notice for three days that he wasn't with her. </p> <p>\"I make a study of these things,\" he says. \"The rapport between men and women is very difficult. Women don't want to be married any more. They've had centuries of frustration, so now they make men pay. They have a revenge to take,\" and he makes the big Gallic shrug of reasonableness. \"We're very weak now,\" he goes on, making a furtive, cowed, little rat of himself before my very eyes, then sighs, his socio-sexual insight quite exhausted. </p> <p>Reflated back into himself, he exudes the tranquillity of a man gratefully retired from the hurly-burly of the chaise-longue. I never caught his wife's name, probably because he never mentioned it. It was always \"My Wife\". \"I have married someone,\" he says as though he still can't believe his luck, \"who doesn't like luxury. She doesn't want diamonds and the too-big houses, she doesn't interfere in my work, she's quiet, she doesn't like to be in focus. She's solid.\" Solid is the word he uses for all that is true and good. His mother, his sister, his wife. Solid, all solid. \"My wife is Swedish, you see. The ice and boiling water. It is good.\" </p> <p>What we're getting at here is the hard-won fact that any bloody fool can fall in love, but it takes hard work and application to learn to trust someone enough to create a proper friendship. And learning isn't something you do just because you think you will. That is the point. He slips into the lyricist's metaphor mode, which could be quite disconcerting if you don't connect romance with addiction. Obviously he does. At all events, he's suddenly talking about how he relieved himself of his four-packs-of-Gauloise-a-day habit. First off, he thought he'd give up. Then he told all his friends that they could call him a bastard if they caught him smoking. Then he bought a special diary - in fact, two special diaries, in case he mucked one of them up. Day One, he wrote neatly on the first page, then Day Two, Day Three, all the way to Day 547. He reckoned he'd cracked it by Day 300, but carried on just to be on the safe side. He's clean now, not counting the odd cigar. Oh, and his wife smokes. It doesn't bother him . . . </p> <p>He would have elaborated upon his theme, but he was called away, paired off with a tabloid celebrity-slayer wearing some kind of see-through Oxfam ballgown and combat boots. Before he disappeared, he caught my eye from across the lobby and, for the fraction of a second, waggled his hands in the air, plastered a great, clown's grin across his face and did a classy imitation of a monkey up a stick. </p> <p>The Great British Premiere of Lautrec, for which Aznavour has written both music and lyrics, has been commuted for reasons of high nervous tension into First Full Dress Rehearsal. Paying customers at Plymouth's Theatre Royal are well up for it. In fact, they seem to regard the producer's apologetic little overture as an unforeseen bonus, easily worth getting dressed up for. It seems quite fun, really, not to have to worry if the scenery should come crashing down or someone were to forget his lines. In the event, nothing untoward happens at all, except for a rogue walking stick clattering to the boards in a quiet moment. Nothing, that is, until the big love song. What we have here is Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, convincingly portrayed by a gentleman of genuinely dwarfish stature to which he has contributed a painful-looking limp, in a steamy clinch with the beautiful young model, Suzanne. As they make their way through a perfectly charming duet anticipating their upcoming leg-over, they fumble feverishly at each others' garments and erogenous zones in a manner to which the citizens of Plymouth have clearly not been inured. The natives grow restive. A buzz of protest here, an unseemly guffaw there, the prospect of somebody throwing something and wrecking the joint is sweatily on the cards. It dies down, as luck would have it, but the tension is too much for me. </p> <p>Next morning, I put it to Aznavour. What's he going to do about it? Do about what? The raunchy bit, the bit they didn't like, the near riot! He hasn't the faintest idea what I'm talking about. He wasn't listening to the audience; he was watching the actors and imagining if he was on the stage, would he think it was all going cha-boom, cha-boom. As to the song in question, he agrees there is something severely wrong with the balance of the harmonisation and maybe, just maybe, it was too raunchy, too far on, as it were, instead of nicely on the edge. </p> <p>He is mildly interested in my theory of size-ism. Call us bourgeois, I say, but we're just not ready for the coupling of an ugly dwarf and a beautiful, young girl. We are shocked. We don't like it. We think our genetic pool will be polluted. </p> <p>But, he counters, easily matching my naivet\u00e9, it's the truth. Lautrec had sex with all those women, not just one of them. You can't go against the truth, you can't make it up, you've got to go by the book. Otherwise, we might as well write another operetta, the sky is blue, la-la-la-la, the birds are singing, everything is pretty, pretty. Anyway, it's good to disturb the public. </p> <p>\"When I started in this business,\" he explains patiently, \"I disturbed everybody. My awful voice, my ergly face, my peculiar size, my uncommercial songs. For 14 years, I was told I would never be a success. One critic said it was the first time he'd seen a cripple on the stage - you know, a handicapped person, 'infirm' in French - and why not extend the gimmick and have a man with a wooden leg. Well, it was true. I am small and my voice, I think, not as clear as it is today. But the public slowly changed. </p> <p>\"It hurt at first, for a few weeks. Then I thought the critic who wrote that couldn't write my songs but I could write his article. And where is he now? Come on, there are winners and losers, optimists and pessimists, people who listen to every voice and those who are deaf. I was deaf. My road was ahead. In every business, there are those who will put you down. I teach my kids, 'Don't listen. Don't read, and, if you do read, don't admit it.' I used to meet journalists sometimes, and I'd say hallo, how are you? And I'd watch their eyes and see them thinking, 'He hasn't read my article.' Oh, I'd read it, I probably knew it off by heart, but that's the worst thing you can do to a journalist. Not have read his article.\" </p> <p>It has to be asked. Something about the sheer implacability of a 5ft 3in man tapping into the romantic imagination of two continents over three generations speaks of a Tom Thumb complex. You can see him battling upstream on a leaf, armed with a darning needle, ready to take on the world. Does he personally identify with Toulouse-Lautrec? No, he says. Absolutely not. He came from an upper-class background. \"No. No, I don't; I cannot identify with him. Or with Napoleon. Or with any other short people. You know?\" </p> <p>There's no answer to that. \"I will tell you,\" he says, \"something about beauty. What is beauty? The man who is rich is beautiful. The man who is intelligent is beautiful, hmm? The man who is cultured is beautiful. The man who is talented is beautiful. The handsome man is beautiful. The man who can make you laugh is beautiful.\" He counts his beauties out on his fingers, first one hand, plus the thumb, then the first index finger of the other hand. One, two, three, four, five, six. \"There are six beauties I have told you. Beautiful is what is beautiful to you. Lautrec had nearly all the beauties, so I knew I could do something with him.\" </p> <p>A long time ago, back in 1972, Aznavour wrote and sang a song called (in English) What Makes A Man A Man. It was a tender little love song about a man who lived companionably with his mother, cross-dressed in his spare time and suffered horribly from the pangs of unrequited love. When he first sang it, he was advised to introduce it to the audience with a personal disclaimer to the effect that he was not gay. He refused, of course, just stood there and warbled his homage to homosexual humanity, shaking like a leaf and hoping he wouldn't get lynched. Particularly in America. \"There are no taboos in art. Lautrec painted a woman on a chamber pot. Art is art. How can we have less in music? We have to be brave. There must be no taboos. The little, ugly man has the same right to have sex as anybody else. Love is love. Sex is sex. One step onwards,\" he says. \"It is not at 75 years old that I am going to step back.\" </p> <p>Last night they did not demand a curtain call. Nobody shouted author. Aznavour is thankful for that. He says he hates it when it happens. You've done your work, it is over, what can you say? It's like people asking for your autograph. What is it for? You write your name on a piece of paper. Why? </p> <p>There is a restaurant in Aix-en-Provence, just in front of the casino, where they have a photograph of the troupe of entertainers with whom Aznavour banged his tambourine when he was 11-and-a-half years old. They are all there, all except the child Charles. He just said no. It didn't mean anything. He has no record of himself, no photographs, nothing. What he keeps are letters from people he's never met. Nice letters. From Jean Cocteau, Malcolm Bradbury, Marlene Dietrich, he's kept those. They mean something. What matters to him now is that his wife, that unexpected She, flew in for the dress rehearsal and that She who routinely hates musicals said she liked it. And not only that, but she wanted to see it again. </p> <p>\"Stardom?\" he says. Pffff. He's a craftsman, that is all. It's not important any more. One movie more, one performance more, one more song, one day you die and how long will you be remembered? How many great painters and artists and musicians, the rage of their time, have been forgotten? Pfffff </p> <p>He says, \"I have my mausoleum\", and it sounds like the beginning of a new song. His hands come up to describe it. It is a leetle mausoleum, and apparently about the size of a television set. He says he never visits it, because it's about 30 miles outside Paris, but he knows it's there and it's nice and his mother and father are there and one day he will join them. But he doesn't care. It isn't important. His name is not written there, only its Armenian original. The family name </p>",

      "bodyText": "My friend Jane is a serious Aznavour fan. When she was a schoolgirl, Jane found a photograph of him in a magazine, cut it out and gummed it up on her bedroom wall. She must have been a weird kid, one of those brooding isolates with an unnaturally high IQ who read Virgil for pleasure. So far as she was concerned, sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt entirely defined her passion. It was a high-minded kind of love. One day, her father went into her room and saw her pin-up. \"Why?\" he asked. \"Why him?\" She didn't answer, of course, so he had to work it out for himself. He stared long and hard into the double-Janus face and drew his own conclusion. He made a sound like the dull thud of a penny dropping and slowly walked away. It wasn't mentioned again. Jane has retained her admiration for Aznavour along with all his old albums. She insists he is a gypsy. A real gypsy. She says that you can hear it in his voice and in the words of the songs he sings. And so you can. Which is not to say his is like any other voice, gypsy or otherwise; more, it is the inimitable, unmistakable sound of a man who has found his own voice from the place inside himself he has his highest hopes of and allows it to sing for him. A one-off voice. Not too many men, in or out of showbusiness, are ever that bold about themselves. They come and go in trendy clutches, safe as houses. They sound good, bad or indifferent, but invariably similar to each other. If it does it for you, it does it for most people at the same time, but it doesn't last. Timidity attracts timidity is why. Heart-throbs are replaceable. It's like serial monogamy: the sex part doesn't sustain a lifetime because it wasn't brave enough to come from the heart in the first place. When you get in there amongst it, into the narrative themes of Aznavour's particular romanticism - the love, life, memory, guilt, remorse, loss, infidelity, disappointment, pain and longing of it all - you find there is nothing meretricious in the full-orchestral, carousel-crescendant enormity of their dramatisation; that these are only rather subtly appropriate. And timeless. On this his 66th year in showbusiness, Charles Aznavour is in England for the staging of his musical, Lautrec.

Then his mother, sad, sweet and child-sized, sewing, by lamplight until the oil ran out, who wept silently for her family slaughtered, every one of them, by the Turks in Armenia. Nothing was ever said - he just grew up knowing his tiny mother had experienced unspeakable, horrific things and that somehow she had survived them. \"I have that tragedy in my blood,\" he says with not unwarranted solemnity. \"And the blood became eeeenk.\" But bitter? Why should he be bitter? His mother had him in the Free Hospital in Paris and took him home to a 25 square-metreroom, with no water, no electricity and five people living, sleeping and eating in it. \"And from there I am here,\" he says. \"Why do I have to be bitter?\" There's an old racist joke about Armenians, doubtless originated in the years between the two world wars when Aznavour was a boy.

At all events, Charles Aznavour was a professional singer at 10 and upon mature reflection counts himself the first existential singer in France on account of not owning a suit and being therefore obliged to perform barefoot with trousers sewn by a cousin and a sweatshirt the colour - this he remembers particularly - of fading Bordeaux. He teamed up with an older boy, who wrote tunes for his lyrics and, at the age of 16, presented his portfolio to a publishing company. He couldn't play the piano in those days, just a few dramatic chords, but he struck them anyway with rather more panache than skill, crash, crash, crash, till the chandelier in the centre of the publisher's ceiling fell down, boom, and shattered all over the floor. They didn't buy his songs, of course, but they let him sweep up the chandelier and told him they found him, you know, interesting . By the time the German army occupied Paris, Charles was earning enough to branch out into a brief career as a sort of Resistance spiv. He bought up the sad scrappings of a defunct chocolate factory and became the owner of the only collection of boxed chocolates in Europe. They turned out to be a truly awful confection, cheap and nasty with paper-thin chocolate and saccharine centres, so he'd take them to where the German trucks were parked and sell them to the German soldiers. Then run like the wind. His trade in fake silk stockings was easier. You put your hand in them and sccccrttt, ladders everywhere. Only they wouldn't know that until they'd sent them to their wives. He was equally sanguine about the tasks he undertook for his parents, which mostly consisted of getting rid of German uniforms taken from Russian and Armenian conscripts to the German army. His mother found them civilian clothes, and helped hide or send them on their way, a small Resistance contribution Charles never felt was dangerous because nobody ever suggested it might be. Hence, when he found a pair of German jackboots that fitted him, he kept them. He even wore them to work, which slightly altered the existential image and might conceivably have contributed to a modest shoe fetish that persists to this day. \"Look here,\" he says, producing an impeccably black-calf-shod foot from under the table. \"Brand new! I bought these 15 years ago, and this is their first outing. I hoard shoes. Buy 20 pairs at a time and hoard them.\" He visits his shoes on a regular basis. Scans the array: shall he, shan't he treat himself to a pristine pair today? It can be quite a little struggle. Not today, maybe next time. Save them up. And, like Wagner in pursuit of a leitmotif, he concludes, \"It is peculiar .\" When we rather nervously embark upon the obligatory quest for the wit and wisdom of a man with a world-class romantic reputation, Aznavour is instantly up-front and undefended. It is already clear that he has enjoyed certain fundamental psychological advantages in his life. His father manifestly loved his mother, for one thing, and for another he made a lifelong friend of his sister. Not only is he not afraid of women, he comes across as one of those rare male creatures who actually likes them so much that he doesn't feel macho-honourbound to arse about with meaningful eye contact and body language. He just is , which is probably about as sexy as a man can be. His sexual history, while long and exotic, has led him to an uxorious plateau, 36 years wide, in which he grazes like a complacent stag. It has been, he says, a learning process, which sentiment he has long since immortalised in the somewhat daunting lyric \"You've got to learn to leave the table/When love is no longer served.\" It has not been an easy study. He has been married three times, which makes two divorces. He thought he would be in love forever and, bingo, he wasn't. So this is what he did: up to the mouth goes the hand holding an imaginary toothbrush, out goes the other hand relinquishing an imaginary key. It's over. Leave everything behind, pay up and do not complain. \"I have paid for my freedom,\" he says, and you could almost imagine he doesn't begrudge a centime of it. His second wife was a difficult woman to leave. Mainly because she wasn't the sort of girl a man would walk out on. She was beautiful, she was strong, she was wonderfully flashy. He was, by this time, noticeably successful, and maybe what he thought was love was merely his vanity awarding itself a status symbol. Unfortunately, for the pair of them, she seems to have been beset by a sort of complementary vanity of her own, in that she threw herself into a programme of ruthless aggrandisement of her husband. She filled their life with influential people and expected him to promote himself with tales of his latest triumph and bore on about his work, than which activity he'd as soon have stuck bodkins in his eyes. Toothbrush time came round again and, God knows, he tried to be stoical. In the end, he took the coward's way out, waited for her to go away for a weekend, packed his bag and left. It was getting to be a habit. Whenever romance palled, he'd wait until he was about to go on tour, wave goodbye and never come back. The only way to ameliorate the guilt was to pay up like a sugar-daddy. Once, in Brazil, there was a lovely girl. They planned a romantic holiday together and were all set to go when disenchantment set in. He bought a big, beautiful yellow Lancia for the trip and she was so thrilled with it she didn't notice for three days that he wasn't with her. \"I make a study of these things,\" he says. \"The rapport between men and women is very difficult. Women don't want to be married any more. They've had centuries of frustration, so now they make men pay. They have a revenge to take,\" and he makes the big Gallic shrug of reasonableness. \"We're very weak now,\" he goes on, making a furtive, cowed, little rat of himself before my very eyes, then sighs, his socio-sexual insight quite exhausted. Reflated back into himself, he exudes the tranquillity of a man gratefully retired from the hurly-burly of the chaise-longue. I never caught his wife's name, probably because he never mentioned it. It was always \"My Wife\". \"I have married someone,\" he says as though he still can't believe his luck, \"who doesn't like luxury. She doesn't want diamonds and the too-big houses, she doesn't interfere in my work, she's quiet, she doesn't like to be in focus. She's solid.\" Solid is the word he uses for all that is true and good. His mother, his sister, his wife. Solid, all solid. \"My wife is Swedish, you see. The ice and boiling water. It is good.\" What we're getting at here is the hard-won fact that any bloody fool can fall in love, but it takes hard work and application to learn to trust someone enough to create a proper friendship. And learning isn't something you do just because you think you will. That is the point. He slips into the lyricist's metaphor mode, which could be quite disconcerting if you don't connect romance with addiction. Obviously he does. At all events, he's suddenly talking about how he relieved himself of his four-packs-of-Gauloise-a-day habit. First off, he thought he'd give up. Then he told all his friends that they could call him a bastard if they caught him smoking. Then he bought a special diary - in fact, two special diaries, in case he mucked one of them up. Day One, he wrote neatly on the first page, then Day Two, Day Three, all the way to Day 547. He reckoned he'd cracked it by Day 300, but carried on just to be on the safe side. He's clean now, not counting the odd cigar. Oh, and his wife smokes. It doesn't bother him . . . He would have elaborated upon his theme, but he was called away, paired off with a tabloid celebrity-slayer wearing some kind of see-through Oxfam ballgown and combat boots. Before he disappeared, he caught my eye from across the lobby and, for the fraction of a second, waggled his hands in the air, plastered a great, clown's grin across his face and did a classy imitation of a monkey up a stick. The Great British Premiere of Lautrec, for which Aznavour has written both music and lyrics, has been commuted for reasons of high nervous tension into First Full Dress Rehearsal. Paying customers at Plymouth's Theatre Royal are well up for it. In fact, they seem to regard the producer's apologetic little overture as an unforeseen bonus, easily worth getting dressed up for. It seems quite fun, really, not to have to worry if the scenery should come crashing down or someone were to forget his lines. In the event, nothing untoward happens at all, except for a rogue walking stick clattering to the boards in a quiet moment. Nothing, that is, until the big love song. What we have here is Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, convincingly portrayed by a gentleman of genuinely dwarfish stature to which he has contributed a painful-looking limp, in a steamy clinch with the beautiful young model, Suzanne. As they make their way through a perfectly charming duet anticipating their upcoming leg-over, they fumble feverishly at each others' garments and erogenous zones in a manner to which the citizens of Plymouth have clearly not been inured. The natives grow restive. A buzz of protest here, an unseemly guffaw there, the prospect of somebody throwing something and wrecking the joint is sweatily on the cards. It dies down, as luck would have it, but the tension is too much for me. Next morning, I put it to Aznavour. What's he going to do about it? Do about what? The raunchy bit, the bit they didn't like, the near riot! He hasn't the faintest idea what I'm talking about. He wasn't listening to the audience; he was watching the actors and imagining if he was on the stage, would he think it was all going cha-boom, cha-boom. As to the song in question, he agrees there is something severely wrong with the balance of the harmonisation and maybe, just maybe, it was too raunchy, too far on, as it were, instead of nicely on the edge. He is mildly interested in my theory of size-ism. Call us bourgeois, I say, but we're just not ready for the coupling of an ugly dwarf and a beautiful, young girl. We are shocked. We don't like it. We think our genetic pool will be polluted. But, he counters, easily matching my naivet\u00e9, it's the truth. Lautrec had sex with all those women, not just one of them. You can't go against the truth, you can't make it up, you've got to go by the book. Otherwise, we might as well write another operetta, the sky is blue, la-la-la-la, the birds are singing, everything is pretty, pretty. Anyway, it's good to disturb the public. \"When I started in this business,\" he explains patiently, \"I disturbed everybody. My awful voice, my ergly face, my peculiar size, my uncommercial songs. For 14 years, I was told I would never be a success. One critic said it was the first time he'd seen a cripple on the stage - you know, a handicapped person, 'infirm' in French - and why not extend the gimmick and have a man with a wooden leg. Well, it was true. I am small and my voice, I think, not as clear as it is today. But the public slowly changed. \"It hurt at first, for a few weeks. Then I thought the critic who wrote that couldn't write my songs but I could write his article. And where is he now? Come on, there are winners and losers, optimists and pessimists, people who listen to every voice and those who are deaf. I was deaf. My road was ahead. In every business, there are those who will put you down. I teach my kids, 'Don't listen. Don't read, and, if you do read, don't admit it.' I used to meet journalists sometimes, and I'd say hallo, how are you? And I'd watch their eyes and see them thinking, 'He hasn't read my article.' Oh, I'd read it, I probably knew it off by heart, but that's the worst thing you can do to a journalist. Not have read his article.\" It has to be asked. Something about the sheer implacability of a 5ft 3in man tapping into the romantic imagination of two continents over three generations speaks of a Tom Thumb complex. You can see him battling upstream on a leaf, armed with a darning needle, ready to take on the world. Does he personally identify with Toulouse-Lautrec? No, he says. Absolutely not. He came from an upper-class background. \"No. No, I don't; I cannot identify with him. Or with Napoleon. Or with any other short people. You know?\" There's no answer to that. \"I will tell you,\" he says, \"something about beauty. What is beauty? The man who is rich is beautiful. The man who is intelligent is beautiful, hmm? The man who is cultured is beautiful. The man who is talented is beautiful. The handsome man is beautiful. The man who can make you laugh is beautiful.\" He counts his beauties out on his fingers, first one hand, plus the thumb, then the first index finger of the other hand. One, two, three, four, five, six. \"There are six beauties I have told you. Beautiful is what is beautiful to you. Lautrec had nearly all the beauties, so I knew I could do something with him.\" A long time ago, back in 1972, Aznavour wrote and sang a song called (in English) What Makes A Man A Man. It was a tender little love song about a man who lived companionably with his mother, cross-dressed in his spare time and suffered horribly from the pangs of unrequited love. When he first sang it, he was advised to introduce it to the audience with a personal disclaimer to the effect that he was not gay. He refused, of course, just stood there and warbled his homage to homosexual humanity, shaking like a leaf and hoping he wouldn't get lynched. Particularly in America. \"There are no taboos in art. Lautrec painted a woman on a chamber pot. Art is art. How can we have less in music? We have to be brave. There must be no taboos. The little, ugly man has the same right to have sex as anybody else. Love is love. Sex is sex. One step onwards,\" he says. \"It is not at 75 years old that I am going to step back.\" Last night they did not demand a curtain call. Nobody shouted author. Aznavour is thankful for that. He says he hates it when it happens. You've done your work, it is over, what can you say? It's like people asking for your autograph. What is it for? You write your name on a piece of paper. Why? There is a restaurant in Aix-en-Provence, just in front of the casino, where they have a photograph of the troupe of entertainers with whom Aznavour banged his tambourine when he was 11-and-a-half years old. They are all there, all except the child Charles. He just said no. It didn't mean anything. He has no record of himself, no photographs, nothing. What he keeps are letters from people he's never met. Nice letters. From Jean Cocteau, Malcolm Bradbury, Marlene Dietrich, he's kept those. They mean something. What matters to him now is that his wife, that unexpected She, flew in for the dress rehearsal and that She who routinely hates musicals said she liked it. And not only that, but she wanted to see it again. \"Stardom?\" he says. Pffff. He's a craftsman, that is all. It's not important any more. One movie more, one performance more, one more song, one day you die and how long will you be remembered? How many great painters and artists and musicians, the rage of their time, have been forgotten? Pfffff He says, \"I have my mausoleum\", and it sounds like the beginning of a new song. His hands come up to describe it. It is a leetle mausoleum, and apparently about the size of a television set. He says he never visits it, because it's about 30 miles outside Paris, but he knows it's there and it's nice and his mother and father are there and one day he will join them. But he doesn't care. It isn't important. His name is not written there, only its Armenian original. The family name",

      "body": "<p>Dennis Homer says that the first thing he saw was the blinding lights. A cluster of police cars wrapped around the one spot, on the Wolverhampton Road, barely two minutes from his house in Birmingham. And those blinding lights, like something from a Spielberg film. It was December 1995, and he was out looking for his son, Neil, who had celebrated his 20th birthday only a couple of days earlier. Neil had taken his girlfriend home, would be back in just a few minutes. He was the kind of boy who never arrived home later than he promised. He had left at a quarter past midnight, and when it got to two in the morning and there was still no sign of him, his mother Dianne sent Dennis to look for their son.</p> <p>At 2.40am, he came across the lights. The area was cordoned off. Dennis got out of his car and told one of the policemen he was looking for his son. The officer asked him for the registration number of his car. \"He then looked into the palm of his hand, and I saw part of Neil's registration written on it. The officer just paled.\" Then Dennis saw a police car embedded in the side of a car crushed like a Coke can. By this time, Neil was in hospital. At 3.20am, he was pronounced dead.</p> <p>When the Homers began to recover from the shock, they asked questions. Why had they not been informed about the crash? Was the police car speeding? Had it gone through the traffic lights on red? Few of these questions were answered. They did discover that the crash had happened more than two hours before Dennis stumbled across it. The police told the family that they could not answer their questions because there would have to be an official investigation.</p> <p>The inquiry went on and on and on, in secrecy. Twenty months it took. Not only had Neil Homer been killed, so had the officer in the passenger seat of the police car. \"The key issue was who went through the red lights: was it Neil or the police? And we had to live with that question till the court case.\"</p> <p>Except he didn't. One day soon after the incident, Dennis went on to the radio to ask for witnesses. Two boys rang in to say they'd heard everything. They had tuned into a police wavelength with their scanner and listened in on the most sickening pursuit of a stolen car. When the boys began to go into the details, the presenter cut them off - for legal reasons.</p> <p>Dennis met the boys, who told him all they knew. The police car had been pursuing a stolen car for eight minutes. In that eight minutes they had travelled eight-and-a-half miles through a built-up area. They shot through one set of red lights in excess of 100 miles an hour, then through the last set of red lights at 98 mph. That was when Neil had the misfortune to be turning left on a green light. The boys said the noise of the impact was like a bomb exploding. The stolen car escaped.</p> <p>The boys knew every last detail, including the fact that the police relayed a message saying they thought Neil's white Vauxhall Nova was travelling with the suspect car, ie, that Neil was an accomplice. They heard the panic of police passenger PC Robert Dallow as he tried to stop his driver, Lezlie Collins. They even heard his dying screams.</p> <p>Dennis Homer promised himself he would find the whole truth about his son's death. And the more he talked to witnesses the more outraged he became. He discovered that, although his family had not been told about the crash, the families of both officers had been informed immediately afterwards. He discovered that officers who had said they had heard no siren just before the accident later claimed the siren was working; that some had even claimed the police car went through the lights on green. He heard from people whose houses bordered on the wreckage how they had offered to get blankets for Neil to make him more comfortable and the police had told them to mind their own business. \"They told me my son had been dragged from the car like a piece of meat, and just dumped on the roadway. They treated him like a suspect even when he was dying.\"</p> <p>In February 1997, the case came to court. PC Lezlie Collins was convicted of dangerous driving, jailed for three months (of which he served six weeks) and banned from driving for two years. Eight other officers were eventually warned or formally admonished for neglecting their duty.</p> <p>The deaths of Neil Homer and PC Dallow caused such a stink in the West Midlands Police Force that it led to radical change in pursuit guidelines. Dennis Homer takes out file after file of letters documenting his exchanges with West Midlands Police, the Police Complaints Authority, his lawyers, the police lawyers. He was met with denials time after time. He believes action was only taken because he happened to come across incontrovertible evidence of what had happened.</p> <p>The most recent Home Office police research group study of incidents involving police vehicles reveals that between 1990 and 1993 at least 1,025 people suffered serious injury in collisions with police vehicles, of whom 92 died. Only 7% of police drivers involved in these incidents were found to be blameworthy, 2% of drivers were prosecuted for careless or dangerous driving, and 1.4% of police officers were removed from driving duties. More than 80% of fatalities were suffered by members of the public. According to the Police Complaints Authority (PCA), Lezlie Collins is the only police officer in Britain who has been jailed for dangerous driving.</p> <p>The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) takes the issue of road traffic accidents very seriously, and points to its recent report on pursuit driving as evidence. Gordon Clark, chairman of the ACPO working group on police pursuits and assistant chief constable of Humberside Police, says the daily job of risk assessment is a delicate business. \"That assessment includes balancing the imperative to stop the vehicle against the risk to the general public, including the driver of the vehicle that is being followed. Pursuits are abandoned if, and when, the risk to the public becomes unacceptable.\" While ACPO believes pursuit driving is essential at times, it does aim to minimise those occasions.</p> <p>It was in late December last year that I began to become obsessed with police crashes. Every time I turned on the radio there seemed to be another accident involving a police vehicle. All tragic accidents, all statistics. On December 27, four-year-old Nezer Price and his sister, two-year-old Claudette, were killed in Durham after the police car taking them to a women's refuge was involved in a three-car collision - in this case, a skidding civilian car is thought to be responsible. On December 30, 19-year-old Steven Green was killed by a police car in Wigan while crossing the road. On January 1, Nicola Russell was killed in Belfast after a car being tailed by the police crashed into a ditch. On the same day, a pedestrian died after being hit by a police patrol car in Nottinghamshire. Even the gossip columns had a story that resonated: model Heather Mills, the new girlfriend of Paul McCartney, had had a leg amputated in 1994 after being run over by a police bike answering a false 999 call. The officer then claimed she had been negligent in crossing the road and threatened to sue her for loss of earnings. At the time, an outraged Mills said, \"It's like a sick joke. I have never said a word against this police officer, as in my heart I believed he had probably suffered enough. Obviously, that's not enough. He now wants to take me to the cleaners.\" It's fairly common for the Police Federation to threaten to sue the victim.</p> <p>What had alerted me to all this was the case of the broadcaster Sheena McDonald. In February last year, McDonald was run over by a police van and left in a coma - the vehicle was answering a call to a pub disturbance. She was expected to sustain serious brain damage, but has made a remarkable recovery. Despite her constant tiredness, her scars, her dodgy memory and her permanently blurred vision in one eye, she has started to work again.</p> <p>Court three at Horseferry Road magistrates court is a tiny beige rectangle of a room. On this particular day in January, it is packed with press and and police officers. The driver of the van is being charged with careless driving, a minor offence. McDonald is not appearing as a witness. There is no point. She says she cannot remember anything of the incident, and that it would be too upsetting anyway.</p> <p>A few months previously - in the autumn, when she was recuperating - McDonald had told me she had no strong feelings about the police: she always believed they were there to uphold the law. Although there had been little contact between her and the police since the accident, she presumed it would all end with an apology. Around Christmas time, we met again; she said the police had asked for her blood alcohol level on the night of the accident. \"I'm worried they are going to blacken my character. I don't want to be badmouthed in court. Well, I don't think I will be. I was at a lecture till 10.45pm . . . I wasn't out enjoying myself.\" She was talking like a suspect. She had been making her own enquiries and discovered she had drunk between one and two glasses of wine at the lecture.</p> <p>Few cases in which people have been injured by police vehicles reach the court. But this is special - Sheena McDonald is an admired figure in the public eye. The policeman in the dock, Glenn Whiteley, stares ahead at the coat of arms on the court wall. He is dressed in a sober black suit, but still looks young for his 27 years.</p> <p>The barrister for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) outlines the case - how at 12.20pm on a drizzly winter's night, a police van bypassed two lanes of traffic by driving on the wrong side of the road. At the same time, Sheena McDonald was attempting to cross. The magistrate says the issue is whether PC Whiteley was driving reasonably, competently and prudently.</p> <p>The police passenger, PC Paul Cubbon, takes the stand; he says he saw McDonald look in the way the traffic should have been coming, but he didn't see her look in the direction of the police car. He describes how she was weaving between cars. The barrister for the CPS asks if there could be a reason that she was weaving between the cars. PC Cubbon replies, \"I believe at the time of the accident the pedestrian was under the influence of alcohol.\" Allan Little, BBC correspondent, and partner of McDonald, puffs out his cheeks, opens his mouth and is so shocked he forgets to close it.</p> <p>Marie Simmonite says she was distraught when she received the call from the police in April 1996. Her 15-year-old daughter, Shelley, had never been in any kind of trouble, and here were the police telling her that Shelley and a schoolfriend had been taken to a Sheffield station suspected of stealing. A milkshake. The police phoned at 5pm, and said they would bring Shelley home once they'd sorted out the bookwork. Hours went by. Six, seven, eight. Marie kept phoning the police station, but there was no information. At 8.30pm, she got through, and when she gave her name a bewildered voice asked why no one had been in touch with her.</p> <p>At 9.05pm a police car drew up outside their house, without Shelley. Marie was told she better sit down. \"I remember having to go and wake up her Dad because he'd been working nights down the pit. They told us there had been an accident, and that we had to go down to the hospital. All the time the police officers were saying she's going to be all right, she's going to be all right . . . A lot was covered up at first. But then everything came to light. He was doing 60mph along a winding road, and he was on the wrong side of the road. It came out in court that the police officers were annoyed at having to take her home so late when they should have been off duty.\"</p> <p>Marie asks herself over and over again why it had to happen. \"The CPS were quite disgusting,\" she says. \"It was like a dress rehearsal between both sides, I felt we didn't have a chance. If it wasn't so serious, it would be stupid. The police were just saying the car couldn't do more than 70 miles per hour, that it was sluggish. They kept repeating that it was sluggish and that he was a brilliant officer. What's that got to do with it if the car was sluggish?\"</p> <p>Marie says when PC Ward and the police passenger came to give evidence, she was surprised by how little they could recall. \"The driver said he couldn't remember anything from Maltby to the scene of the crash, while Shuttleworth, the passenger, said he was day-dreaming out of the window, thinking about his girlfriend.\"</p> <p>In September 1997, PC Ward was found not guilty of dangerous driving but he was fined for driving carelessly. \"He got a \u00a3500 fine and penalty points. He's still driving,\" she says brusquely. [South Yorkshire Police confirm that PC Ward is still in the force, but consider it inappropriate to say whether he is still driving.] For Marie, the court case simply compounded her hurt. \"They didn't treat it as a death. It was as if Shelley didn't mean anything. I would like to see the law changed to something stronger. They have to take into consideration that someone died, because they didn't in our case.\"</p> <p>It's a common complaint. The jury or magistrate is not allowed to take the consequences of the accident into account when reaching its verdict. Victims complain that because of the nature of the Crown Prosecution Service's work (assessing police evidence and deciding whether to prosecute) it tends to be sympathetic towards, if not friendly with, the police. Both Dennis Homer and Marie Simmonite believe that while the Police Federation hired top barristers, they were simply given a CPS barrister with no interest in winning the case. Because it is the crown prosecuting the police, they say they are not treated as victims, that they feel excluded from the legal process.</p> <p>Since the criminal case, the Simmonites have taken out a civil case for compensation. The Police Federation, the trade association that represents the police, is fighting it all the way. \"They say that I can't have suffered post-traumatic stress because I wasn't at the scene of the accident. I don't know how to put this . . . they've made it like it's our fault. It's not enough that Shelley's died. They've made me feel bad about claiming damages. At the beginning, I said I didn't want money, but I didn't get justice in court. It's not about the money. The money's horrible. It's about recognition. I just want them to recognise what they've done.\"</p> <p>She reads me a passage from a letter sent to her by the Police Federation lawyers Dibb, Lupton and Alsop. \"They said if you had 'phlegm and fortitude' you wouldn't be suing for post-traumatic stress. That means guts, doesn't it? I had to look it up in the dictionary. They're trying to say we haven't got guts, that if we had a typical English stiff upper lip, we wouldn't be claiming. You've got to have no heart if you're not cut up about losing your daughter.\"</p> <p>According to the Home Office report based on the 1990-93 figures on police road accidents, 45% of fatalities occurred during pursuits, 23% while officers were responding to emergency calls and 20% on routine patrol. Which raises the question: why are there so many fatalities on routine patrol? And if, as recorded, more than 1,000 people in Britain were seriously injured in a three-year period, how many minor injuries were there?</p> <p>Molly Meacher, acting chair of the Police Complaints Authority, says that, while she is encouraged by ACPO's recent guidelines on pursuit driving - which includes the increased use of helicopter support - there is no evidence of a reduction in deaths and injuries. \"I think they are shocking figures. For anyone to lose a life in catching a joyrider is unacceptable isn't it?\" Meacher acknowledges that for the police to prove their innocence, they must in effect prove the victim of an accident is in some way to blame. \"I think there is something profoundly wrong with the British adversarial system,\" she says bluntly.</p> <p>The average age of police drivers involved in road traffic incidents causing death or serious injury is 25-29. Meacher says this is probably a fair reflection of the average age of police drivers, but she would like to see older drivers on the road - younger officers are more likely to be enveloped by the infamous \"red mist syndrome\", when drivers are so exhilarated by the chase that they refuse to give up the target.</p> <p>Why are there so many accidents? \"I think officers are being expected to achieve targets in terms of response times, which leads them to put the public in danger. Also, the PCA believes there has been a tendency in some forces to reduce the amount of training for pursuit drivers and other drivers, \"and that has to be a very dubious policy in terms of the sheer financial cost to the force, let alone the cost in lives and injuries to the general public\". Pursuit drivers should be trained to advanced level. But the Home Office study revealed that, of those drivers trained only to basic level who had been involved in serious accidents, 15% were participating in pursuits.</p> <p>The campaigning group for victims of traffic accidents, RoadPeace, says the real question is not how pursuits are controlled but whether the police need to pursue at all. Chairwoman, Zoe Stow, says: \"Certain states in America no longer pursue stolen cars. They just use Stingers, which rip the tyres, or a helicopter surveillance. We think the police need to examine whether it really is worth putting lives at risk to pursue a stolen car.\" She argues that, unlike the ambulance and fire services, there are relatively few times a police vehicle needs to speed, because they tend to be called to an an incident after the event. \"Here at RoadPeace, we hear sirens every couple of minutes, and we simply don't know whether they are responding to genuine emergencies or just going fast because it is convenient for them.\"</p> <p>Police drivers undoubtedly have an image problem. Even when police are attending emergencies, many members of the public are not convinced they have a good reason for speeding. As Sheena McDonald says, \"Why do I trust an ambulance and fire engine when they drive fast or on the wrong side of the road, but am deeply suspicious of police cars?\" Of course, occasionally members of the public are hit by ambulances and fire engines, but the Home Office says it has never been considered sufficient a problem to demand research.</p> <p>Why are so few officers convicted of careless or dangerous driving? \"A British jury tends to give the police the benefit of the doubt,\" says Meacher. But doesn't a large part of the problem lie with the CPS not really wanting to prosecute? Meacher says she doesn't want to make sweeping generalisations, but yes, she is aware of a case \"that was presented excluding a lot of the relevant evidence that would have been damaging to the officer - the driving behaviour in the period prior to the incident on that day, which in my view would have told the jury a lot about the attitude of that officer to his role in driving that police vehicle.\" What could the PCA do to challenge this? \"Nothing. When the prosecution case is put to a case of law we have no control over it.\"</p> <p>Day 2 in Horseferry Road court. The barrister for the Police Federation taps his client encouragingly on the hand and rolls up his sleeves before addressing the magistrate. When the prosecuting barrister raises the issue of the vehicle being unroadworthy - newspaper reports suggested its speedometer wasn't working, its tyres were flattish and the lights were broken - he once again springs to his feet to object. The defects were considered so minor that it was decided before the case that they could not have contributed to the accident, he says. Objection sustained. The police driver Glenn Whiteley takes the stand. He says he is sure he and McDonald exchanged eye contact - in other words, she should not have proceeded to cross the road.</p> <p>Christine Murphy talks with such pride about her brother, John Plender Todd - a giant of a man in every sense. Six-foot-three, as strong as they come, a triathlete who had done the Great North Run, a lifeguard in the summer holidays. On November 6, 1997, John Plender Todd crossed the road for the last time.</p> <p>PC Ian Graham had been called out to attend a flat battery in the Washington area of Newcastle - the car was stuck precariously in the middle of the road. He regarded it as an emergency, and took a two-way slip road at 65-70 miles an hour. He shot round a pedestrian refuge on the wrong side of the road, collided with the kerb and hit John who was thought to have just taken his first step into the road. The car hit John at 46 mph.</p> <p>\"My brother was 15 stone, and he was thrown 75 ft before hitting the ground. The police constable walked away with nothing, not even a penalty point.\" In February 1999, PC Graham appeared at Newcastle Crown Court charged with causing death by dangerous driving. It emerged in court that he had been advised by the control room that he need not attend the scene. One of the leading witnesses, a lorry driver, was driving on Blue House Lane, where the accident had happened, but his evidence was ultimately rejected. \"He couldn't exactly remember the position of the two pedestrian refuges. But he wasn't shaky about the speed, or the fact that the police car had swerved on to the wrong side of the road. On the final day, when the barrister for the police was summing up, he asked the jury to dismiss the lorry driver's evidence because it was inaccurate.\" PC Graham was acquitted, and still works for the police.</p> <p>Back in Horseferry Road court three, the barrister for the Police Federation is summing up. He examines the conflicting evidence of the police driver and the police passenger. The latter claims McDonald was weaving as she walked, he inaccurately described the route the police car had taken and, most importantly, he said McDonald had not looked in the direction of the police - a statement that could only lead to the conclusion that the police driver should have stopped if acting prudently. The barrister asks the magistrate to reject PC Cubbon's evidence because of its inconsistencies. He says Cubbon was obviously traumatised by the incident.</p> <p>Giving judgment, the magistrate acknowledges the inconsistencies in PC Cubbon's evidence, and prefers to rely on the evidence of an investigating officer at the scene, who reported that, despite what Cubbon has said in court, both officers told him McDonald had made eye contact with them. The magistrate acquits PC Whiteley of careless driving. The Met, like all the other police forces involved in this story, say their officer is unavailable for comment.</p> <p>The next day, I ask Sheena McDonald how she is feeling. \"Grumpy. I'm so hyper I've not been able to sleep.\" She says her world view has been shaken. \"I think I'm on the verge of being an anarchist. I used to believe in the police, and law and order, and now I feel so disappointed and angry. After all they've done, they now trash my name, suggest I'm some kind of alcoholic. I feel as if I've been in court, and if the police are acquitted it leaves some taint on me . . . I think justice is flexible to say the least. It makes me embarrassed that it's taken me so long to realise this.\"</p> <p>Dennis Homer is waiting for me at the door of his Birmingham home. I shake his hand, which is gnarled with arthritis. He introduces me to his wife, Dianne, and daughter, Joanne. Homer has spent four years campaigning, and he has no intention of stopping now. He says he can't stop. After PC Lezlie Collins was released from jail and taken back into the police force, Dennis and his family campaigned outside the West Midlands HQ. Soon afterwards, Collins was pensioned off by the police, suffering from post-traumatic stress. Dennis then fought successfully for a change in the guidelines to police pursuits. Nowadays, all pursuits have to be manned by a senior officer from the control room, the police passenger has the right to call off a pursuit and, wherever possible, a helicopter accompanies a pursuit. If a driver is caught driving through red lights without reason, West Midlands Police has promised to charge the officer.</p> <p>\"I know the policy is working,\" says Dennis with a sheepish grin. \"I've got my own scanner -it's illegal, but I've already told Chief Inspector Mike Dixon that it was bought for my birthday. Every night I listen in to the police to see if they are behaving themselves, and now I hear pursuits being stopped when they get too dangerous.\" He tunes in, and within a minute we hear a pursuit. \"It's on the motorway, see there's a helicopter . . . Good.\"</p> <p>Now, Dennis would like the West Midlands policy to be be adopted nationwide. But ACPO says it cannot issue anything stronger than recommendations, because \"the law recognises the accountability and responsibility of individual chief constables in relation to operational policing issue\".</p> <p>Dennis Homer's battles have met with much opposition. In June 1997, David Twigg, a partner at Russell Jones and Walker, a law firm that represents the Police Federation, wrote an article in the Birmingham Post about the Homer case. He said, in apparent contradiction to police guidelines, that, \"The activities of criminals and, more rarely, the actions of police officers who seek to protect the public, will inevitably create risks. It is inevitable, on occasion, innocent bystanders will be killed or injured.\" At around the same time, PC David Sheldon, of the West Midlands Police Federation, said of jailed officer Lezlie Collins: \"For someone to carry out their duties and be sent to prison when something goes wrong cannot be right.\"</p> <p>Last April, the West Midlands Police Federation chairman, Bob Davies, wrote in the Birmingham Evening Mail that it was increasingly difficult for officers to carry out their duty, and that the price is rising crime. \"There is a feeling that boy racers, local villains and the like are taking the rise. It seems that unless it's an armed robbery and there is a man with a smoking gun, you can't pursue,\" he complained. \"Even then, you have to have all the training and be in a car which is suitable.\"</p> <p>But Dennis continues to campaign. His next target is the PCA. \"My argument is that you can't have the police investigate their own. Ten years ago, when it was set up, I think the Police Federation were frightened to death of the PCA, but now I don't think the Federation are bothered, because they're a useless body.\" While the PCA supervises investigations, they are ultimately carried out by the police. \"They are the body to represent the public, and they do nothing . . . In our particular case, you've got the West Midlands police force investigating the West Midlands police. And the accident involved police officers from K Division, and it was K Division that investigated it.</p> <p>\"Did you know Joanne is Neil's twin?\" asks Dennis. Joanne is now 24. At the time of Neil's death, she was working as a volunteer special constable. \"I used to finish my full-time job at 5.30, and I'd be down at the station by 6.30. I loved it.\" After Neil's death, Joanne's parents didn't want her to return to the police, but she was determined. Joanne was in for a shock. \"About a month after the accident, I went back up there to go on duty, and one of the officers turned around and said 'You're not one of us any more, you're not welcome at this station.' He virtually threw me out of the office.\" Joanne is now training to be a nurse.</p> <p>Just before I leave, Dennis asks if I've seen Neil's bedroom. He leads me up the stairs. The room is frozen in time. The bed is made for Neil, with a Valentine's card from his girlfriend, Rachel, by the side. There are three framed photographs of a gleaming-white Vauxhall Nova, and propped against the tape recorder is his registration plate, E398 BGS. There are two bouquets of flowers on the bed.</p> <p>\"It doesn't get any easier. You just learn to hide it better. I wish every police officer involved that night could have met our Neil. He was just . . . very special . . . Even if the police had apologised, I would have thought more of them. If they could have come up here, and said we're sorry.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dennis Homer says that the first thing he saw was the blinding lights. A cluster of police cars wrapped around the one spot, on the Wolverhampton Road, barely two minutes from his house in Birmingham. And those blinding lights, like something from a Spielberg film. It was December 1995, and he was out looking for his son, Neil, who had celebrated his 20th birthday only a couple of days earlier. Neil had taken his girlfriend home, would be back in just a few minutes. He was the kind of boy who never arrived home later than he promised. He had left at a quarter past midnight, and when it got to two in the morning and there was still no sign of him, his mother Dianne sent Dennis to look for their son. At 2.40am, he came across the lights. The area was cordoned off. Dennis got out of his car and told one of the policemen he was looking for his son. The officer asked him for the registration number of his car. \"He then looked into the palm of his hand, and I saw part of Neil's registration written on it. The officer just paled.\" Then Dennis saw a police car embedded in the side of a car crushed like a Coke can. By this time, Neil was in hospital. At 3.20am, he was pronounced dead. When the Homers began to recover from the shock, they asked questions. Why had they not been informed about the crash? Was the police car speeding? Had it gone through the traffic lights on red? Few of these questions were answered. They did discover that the crash had happened more than two hours before Dennis stumbled across it. The police told the family that they could not answer their questions because there would have to be an official investigation. The inquiry went on and on and on, in secrecy. Twenty months it took. Not only had Neil Homer been killed, so had the officer in the passenger seat of the police car. \"The key issue was who went through the red lights: was it Neil or the police? And we had to live with that question till the court case.\" Except he didn't. One day soon after the incident, Dennis went on to the radio to ask for witnesses. Two boys rang in to say they'd heard everything. They had tuned into a police wavelength with their scanner and listened in on the most sickening pursuit of a stolen car. When the boys began to go into the details, the presenter cut them off - for legal reasons. Dennis met the boys, who told him all they knew. The police car had been pursuing a stolen car for eight minutes. In that eight minutes they had travelled eight-and-a-half miles through a built-up area. They shot through one set of red lights in excess of 100 miles an hour, then through the last set of red lights at 98 mph. That was when Neil had the misfortune to be turning left on a green light. The boys said the noise of the impact was like a bomb exploding. The stolen car escaped. The boys knew every last detail, including the fact that the police relayed a message saying they thought Neil's white Vauxhall Nova was travelling with the suspect car, ie, that Neil was an accomplice. They heard the panic of police passenger PC Robert Dallow as he tried to stop his driver, Lezlie Collins. They even heard his dying screams. Dennis Homer promised himself he would find the whole truth about his son's death. And the more he talked to witnesses the more outraged he became. He discovered that, although his family had not been told about the crash, the families of both officers had been informed immediately afterwards. He discovered that officers who had said they had heard no siren just before the accident later claimed the siren was working; that some had even claimed the police car went through the lights on green. He heard from people whose houses bordered on the wreckage how they had offered to get blankets for Neil to make him more comfortable and the police had told them to mind their own business. \"They told me my son had been dragged from the car like a piece of meat, and just dumped on the roadway. They treated him like a suspect even when he was dying.\" In February 1997, the case came to court. PC Lezlie Collins was convicted of dangerous driving, jailed for three months (of which he served six weeks) and banned from driving for two years. Eight other officers were eventually warned or formally admonished for neglecting their duty. The deaths of Neil Homer and PC Dallow caused such a stink in the West Midlands Police Force that it led to radical change in pursuit guidelines. Dennis Homer takes out file after file of letters documenting his exchanges with West Midlands Police, the Police Complaints Authority, his lawyers, the police lawyers. He was met with denials time after time. He believes action was only taken because he happened to come across incontrovertible evidence of what had happened. The most recent Home Office police research group study of incidents involving police vehicles reveals that between 1990 and 1993 at least 1,025 people suffered serious injury in collisions with police vehicles, of whom 92 died. Only 7% of police drivers involved in these incidents were found to be blameworthy, 2% of drivers were prosecuted for careless or dangerous driving, and 1.4% of police officers were removed from driving duties. More than 80% of fatalities were suffered by members of the public. According to the Police Complaints Authority (PCA), Lezlie Collins is the only police officer in Britain who has been jailed for dangerous driving. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) takes the issue of road traffic accidents very seriously, and points to its recent report on pursuit driving as evidence. Gordon Clark, chairman of the ACPO working group on police pursuits and assistant chief constable of Humberside Police, says the daily job of risk assessment is a delicate business. \"That assessment includes balancing the imperative to stop the vehicle against the risk to the general public, including the driver of the vehicle that is being followed. Pursuits are abandoned if, and when, the risk to the public becomes unacceptable.\" While ACPO believes pursuit driving is essential at times, it does aim to minimise those occasions. It was in late December last year that I began to become obsessed with police crashes. Every time I turned on the radio there seemed to be another accident involving a police vehicle. All tragic accidents, all statistics. On December 27, four-year-old Nezer Price and his sister, two-year-old Claudette, were killed in Durham after the police car taking them to a women's refuge was involved in a three-car collision - in this case, a skidding civilian car is thought to be responsible. On December 30, 19-year-old Steven Green was killed by a police car in Wigan while crossing the road. On January 1, Nicola Russell was killed in Belfast after a car being tailed by the police crashed into a ditch. On the same day, a pedestrian died after being hit by a police patrol car in Nottinghamshire. Even the gossip columns had a story that resonated: model Heather Mills, the new girlfriend of Paul McCartney, had had a leg amputated in 1994 after being run over by a police bike answering a false 999 call. The officer then claimed she had been negligent in crossing the road and threatened to sue her for loss of earnings. At the time, an outraged Mills said, \"It's like a sick joke. I have never said a word against this police officer, as in my heart I believed he had probably suffered enough. Obviously, that's not enough. He now wants to take me to the cleaners.\" It's fairly common for the Police Federation to threaten to sue the victim. What had alerted me to all this was the case of the broadcaster Sheena McDonald. In February last year, McDonald was run over by a police van and left in a coma - the vehicle was answering a call to a pub disturbance. She was expected to sustain serious brain damage, but has made a remarkable recovery. Despite her constant tiredness, her scars, her dodgy memory and her permanently blurred vision in one eye, she has started to work again. Court three at Horseferry Road magistrates court is a tiny beige rectangle of a room. On this particular day in January, it is packed with press and and police officers. The driver of the van is being charged with careless driving, a minor offence. McDonald is not appearing as a witness. There is no point. She says she cannot remember anything of the incident, and that it would be too upsetting anyway. A few months previously - in the autumn, when she was recuperating - McDonald had told me she had no strong feelings about the police: she always believed they were there to uphold the law. Although there had been little contact between her and the police since the accident, she presumed it would all end with an apology. Around Christmas time, we met again; she said the police had asked for her blood alcohol level on the night of the accident. \"I'm worried they are going to blacken my character. I don't want to be badmouthed in court. Well, I don't think I will be. I was at a lecture till 10.45pm . . . I wasn't out enjoying myself.\" She was talking like a suspect. She had been making her own enquiries and discovered she had drunk between one and two glasses of wine at the lecture. Few cases in which people have been injured by police vehicles reach the court. But this is special - Sheena McDonald is an admired figure in the public eye. The policeman in the dock, Glenn Whiteley, stares ahead at the coat of arms on the court wall. He is dressed in a sober black suit, but still looks young for his 27 years. The barrister for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) outlines the case - how at 12.20pm on a drizzly winter's night, a police van bypassed two lanes of traffic by driving on the wrong side of the road. At the same time, Sheena McDonald was attempting to cross. The magistrate says the issue is whether PC Whiteley was driving reasonably, competently and prudently. The police passenger, PC Paul Cubbon, takes the stand; he says he saw McDonald look in the way the traffic should have been coming, but he didn't see her look in the direction of the police car. He describes how she was weaving between cars. The barrister for the CPS asks if there could be a reason that she was weaving between the cars. PC Cubbon replies, \"I believe at the time of the accident the pedestrian was under the influence of alcohol.\" Allan Little, BBC correspondent, and partner of McDonald, puffs out his cheeks, opens his mouth and is so shocked he forgets to close it. Marie Simmonite says she was distraught when she received the call from the police in April 1996. Her 15-year-old daughter, Shelley, had never been in any kind of trouble, and here were the police telling her that Shelley and a schoolfriend had been taken to a Sheffield station suspected of stealing. A milkshake. The police phoned at 5pm, and said they would bring Shelley home once they'd sorted out the bookwork. Hours went by. Six, seven, eight. Marie kept phoning the police station, but there was no information. At 8.30pm, she got through, and when she gave her name a bewildered voice asked why no one had been in touch with her. At 9.05pm a police car drew up outside their house, without Shelley. Marie was told she better sit down. \"I remember having to go and wake up her Dad because he'd been working nights down the pit. They told us there had been an accident, and that we had to go down to the hospital. All the time the police officers were saying she's going to be all right, she's going to be all right . . . A lot was covered up at first. But then everything came to light. He was doing 60mph along a winding road, and he was on the wrong side of the road. It came out in court that the police officers were annoyed at having to take her home so late when they should have been off duty.\" Marie asks herself over and over again why it had to happen. \"The CPS were quite disgusting,\" she says. \"It was like a dress rehearsal between both sides, I felt we didn't have a chance. If it wasn't so serious, it would be stupid. The police were just saying the car couldn't do more than 70 miles per hour, that it was sluggish. They kept repeating that it was sluggish and that he was a brilliant officer. What's that got to do with it if the car was sluggish?\" Marie says when PC Ward and the police passenger came to give evidence, she was surprised by how little they could recall. \"The driver said he couldn't remember anything from Maltby to the scene of the crash, while Shuttleworth, the passenger, said he was day-dreaming out of the window, thinking about his girlfriend.\" In September 1997, PC Ward was found not guilty of dangerous driving but he was fined for driving carelessly. \"He got a \u00a3500 fine and penalty points. He's still driving,\" she says brusquely. [South Yorkshire Police confirm that PC Ward is still in the force, but consider it inappropriate to say whether he is still driving.] For Marie, the court case simply compounded her hurt. \"They didn't treat it as a death. It was as if Shelley didn't mean anything. I would like to see the law changed to something stronger. They have to take into consideration that someone died, because they didn't in our case.\" It's a common complaint. The jury or magistrate is not allowed to take the consequences of the accident into account when reaching its verdict. Victims complain that because of the nature of the Crown Prosecution Service's work (assessing police evidence and deciding whether to prosecute) it tends to be sympathetic towards, if not friendly with, the police. Both Dennis Homer and Marie Simmonite believe that while the Police Federation hired top barristers, they were simply given a CPS barrister with no interest in winning the case. Because it is the crown prosecuting the police, they say they are not treated as victims, that they feel excluded from the legal process. Since the criminal case, the Simmonites have taken out a civil case for compensation. The Police Federation, the trade association that represents the police, is fighting it all the way. \"They say that I can't have suffered post-traumatic stress because I wasn't at the scene of the accident. I don't know how to put this . . . they've made it like it's our fault. It's not enough that Shelley's died. They've made me feel bad about claiming damages. At the beginning, I said I didn't want money, but I didn't get justice in court. It's not about the money. The money's horrible. It's about recognition. I just want them to recognise what they've done.\" She reads me a passage from a letter sent to her by the Police Federation lawyers Dibb, Lupton and Alsop. \"They said if you had 'phlegm and fortitude' you wouldn't be suing for post-traumatic stress. That means guts, doesn't it? I had to look it up in the dictionary. They're trying to say we haven't got guts, that if we had a typical English stiff upper lip, we wouldn't be claiming. You've got to have no heart if you're not cut up about losing your daughter.\" According to the Home Office report based on the 1990-93 figures on police road accidents, 45% of fatalities occurred during pursuits, 23% while officers were responding to emergency calls and 20% on routine patrol. Which raises the question: why are there so many fatalities on routine patrol? And if, as recorded, more than 1,000 people in Britain were seriously injured in a three-year period, how many minor injuries were there? Molly Meacher, acting chair of the Police Complaints Authority, says that, while she is encouraged by ACPO's recent guidelines on pursuit driving - which includes the increased use of helicopter support - there is no evidence of a reduction in deaths and injuries. \"I think they are shocking figures. For anyone to lose a life in catching a joyrider is unacceptable isn't it?\" Meacher acknowledges that for the police to prove their innocence, they must in effect prove the victim of an accident is in some way to blame. \"I think there is something profoundly wrong with the British adversarial system,\" she says bluntly. The average age of police drivers involved in road traffic incidents causing death or serious injury is 25-29. Meacher says this is probably a fair reflection of the average age of police drivers, but she would like to see older drivers on the road - younger officers are more likely to be enveloped by the infamous \"red mist syndrome\", when drivers are so exhilarated by the chase that they refuse to give up the target. Why are there so many accidents? \"I think officers are being expected to achieve targets in terms of response times, which leads them to put the public in danger. Also, the PCA believes there has been a tendency in some forces to reduce the amount of training for pursuit drivers and other drivers, \"and that has to be a very dubious policy in terms of the sheer financial cost to the force, let alone the cost in lives and injuries to the general public\". Pursuit drivers should be trained to advanced level. But the Home Office study revealed that, of those drivers trained only to basic level who had been involved in serious accidents, 15% were participating in pursuits. The campaigning group for victims of traffic accidents, RoadPeace, says the real question is not how pursuits are controlled but whether the police need to pursue at all. Chairwoman, Zoe Stow, says: \"Certain states in America no longer pursue stolen cars. They just use Stingers, which rip the tyres, or a helicopter surveillance. We think the police need to examine whether it really is worth putting lives at risk to pursue a stolen car.\" She argues that, unlike the ambulance and fire services, there are relatively few times a police vehicle needs to speed, because they tend to be called to an an incident after the event. \"Here at RoadPeace, we hear sirens every couple of minutes, and we simply don't know whether they are responding to genuine emergencies or just going fast because it is convenient for them.\" Police drivers undoubtedly have an image problem. Even when police are attending emergencies, many members of the public are not convinced they have a good reason for speeding. As Sheena McDonald says, \"Why do I trust an ambulance and fire engine when they drive fast or on the wrong side of the road, but am deeply suspicious of police cars?\" Of course, occasionally members of the public are hit by ambulances and fire engines, but the Home Office says it has never been considered sufficient a problem to demand research. Why are so few officers convicted of careless or dangerous driving? \"A British jury tends to give the police the benefit of the doubt,\" says Meacher. But doesn't a large part of the problem lie with the CPS not really wanting to prosecute? Meacher says she doesn't want to make sweeping generalisations, but yes, she is aware of a case \"that was presented excluding a lot of the relevant evidence that would have been damaging to the officer - the driving behaviour in the period prior to the incident on that day, which in my view would have told the jury a lot about the attitude of that officer to his role in driving that police vehicle.\" What could the PCA do to challenge this? \"Nothing. When the prosecution case is put to a case of law we have no control over it.\" Day 2 in Horseferry Road court. The barrister for the Police Federation taps his client encouragingly on the hand and rolls up his sleeves before addressing the magistrate. When the prosecuting barrister raises the issue of the vehicle being unroadworthy - newspaper reports suggested its speedometer wasn't working, its tyres were flattish and the lights were broken - he once again springs to his feet to object. The defects were considered so minor that it was decided before the case that they could not have contributed to the accident, he says. Objection sustained. The police driver Glenn Whiteley takes the stand. He says he is sure he and McDonald exchanged eye contact - in other words, she should not have proceeded to cross the road. Christine Murphy talks with such pride about her brother, John Plender Todd - a giant of a man in every sense. Six-foot-three, as strong as they come, a triathlete who had done the Great North Run, a lifeguard in the summer holidays. On November 6, 1997, John Plender Todd crossed the road for the last time. PC Ian Graham had been called out to attend a flat battery in the Washington area of Newcastle - the car was stuck precariously in the middle of the road. He regarded it as an emergency, and took a two-way slip road at 65-70 miles an hour. He shot round a pedestrian refuge on the wrong side of the road, collided with the kerb and hit John who was thought to have just taken his first step into the road. The car hit John at 46 mph. \"My brother was 15 stone, and he was thrown 75 ft before hitting the ground. The police constable walked away with nothing, not even a penalty point.\" In February 1999, PC Graham appeared at Newcastle Crown Court charged with causing death by dangerous driving. It emerged in court that he had been advised by the control room that he need not attend the scene. One of the leading witnesses, a lorry driver, was driving on Blue House Lane, where the accident had happened, but his evidence was ultimately rejected. \"He couldn't exactly remember the position of the two pedestrian refuges. But he wasn't shaky about the speed, or the fact that the police car had swerved on to the wrong side of the road. On the final day, when the barrister for the police was summing up, he asked the jury to dismiss the lorry driver's evidence because it was inaccurate.\" PC Graham was acquitted, and still works for the police. Back in Horseferry Road court three, the barrister for the Police Federation is summing up. He examines the conflicting evidence of the police driver and the police passenger. The latter claims McDonald was weaving as she walked, he inaccurately described the route the police car had taken and, most importantly, he said McDonald had not looked in the direction of the police - a statement that could only lead to the conclusion that the police driver should have stopped if acting prudently. The barrister asks the magistrate to reject PC Cubbon's evidence because of its inconsistencies. He says Cubbon was obviously traumatised by the incident. Giving judgment, the magistrate acknowledges the inconsistencies in PC Cubbon's evidence, and prefers to rely on the evidence of an investigating officer at the scene, who reported that, despite what Cubbon has said in court, both officers told him McDonald had made eye contact with them. The magistrate acquits PC Whiteley of careless driving. The Met, like all the other police forces involved in this story, say their officer is unavailable for comment. The next day, I ask Sheena McDonald how she is feeling. \"Grumpy. I'm so hyper I've not been able to sleep.\" She says her world view has been shaken. \"I think I'm on the verge of being an anarchist. I used to believe in the police, and law and order, and now I feel so disappointed and angry. After all they've done, they now trash my name, suggest I'm some kind of alcoholic. I feel as if I've been in court, and if the police are acquitted it leaves some taint on me . . . I think justice is flexible to say the least. It makes me embarrassed that it's taken me so long to realise this.\" Dennis Homer is waiting for me at the door of his Birmingham home. I shake his hand, which is gnarled with arthritis. He introduces me to his wife, Dianne, and daughter, Joanne. Homer has spent four years campaigning, and he has no intention of stopping now. He says he can't stop. After PC Lezlie Collins was released from jail and taken back into the police force, Dennis and his family campaigned outside the West Midlands HQ. Soon afterwards, Collins was pensioned off by the police, suffering from post-traumatic stress. Dennis then fought successfully for a change in the guidelines to police pursuits. Nowadays, all pursuits have to be manned by a senior officer from the control room, the police passenger has the right to call off a pursuit and, wherever possible, a helicopter accompanies a pursuit. If a driver is caught driving through red lights without reason, West Midlands Police has promised to charge the officer. \"I know the policy is working,\" says Dennis with a sheepish grin. \"I've got my own scanner -it's illegal, but I've already told Chief Inspector Mike Dixon that it was bought for my birthday. Every night I listen in to the police to see if they are behaving themselves, and now I hear pursuits being stopped when they get too dangerous.\" He tunes in, and within a minute we hear a pursuit. \"It's on the motorway, see there's a helicopter . . . Good.\" Now, Dennis would like the West Midlands policy to be be adopted nationwide. But ACPO says it cannot issue anything stronger than recommendations, because \"the law recognises the accountability and responsibility of individual chief constables in relation to operational policing issue\". Dennis Homer's battles have met with much opposition. In June 1997, David Twigg, a partner at Russell Jones and Walker, a law firm that represents the Police Federation, wrote an article in the Birmingham Post about the Homer case. He said, in apparent contradiction to police guidelines, that, \"The activities of criminals and, more rarely, the actions of police officers who seek to protect the public, will inevitably create risks. It is inevitable, on occasion, innocent bystanders will be killed or injured.\" At around the same time, PC David Sheldon, of the West Midlands Police Federation, said of jailed officer Lezlie Collins: \"For someone to carry out their duties and be sent to prison when something goes wrong cannot be right.\" Last April, the West Midlands Police Federation chairman, Bob Davies, wrote in the Birmingham Evening Mail that it was increasingly difficult for officers to carry out their duty, and that the price is rising crime. \"There is a feeling that boy racers, local villains and the like are taking the rise. It seems that unless it's an armed robbery and there is a man with a smoking gun, you can't pursue,\" he complained. \"Even then, you have to have all the training and be in a car which is suitable.\" But Dennis continues to campaign. His next target is the PCA. \"My argument is that you can't have the police investigate their own. Ten years ago, when it was set up, I think the Police Federation were frightened to death of the PCA, but now I don't think the Federation are bothered, because they're a useless body.\" While the PCA supervises investigations, they are ultimately carried out by the police. \"They are the body to represent the public, and they do nothing . . . In our particular case, you've got the West Midlands police force investigating the West Midlands police. And the accident involved police officers from K Division, and it was K Division that investigated it. \"Did you know Joanne is Neil's twin?\" asks Dennis. Joanne is now 24. At the time of Neil's death, she was working as a volunteer special constable. \"I used to finish my full-time job at 5.30, and I'd be down at the station by 6.30. I loved it.\" After Neil's death, Joanne's parents didn't want her to return to the police, but she was determined. Joanne was in for a shock. \"About a month after the accident, I went back up there to go on duty, and one of the officers turned around and said 'You're not one of us any more, you're not welcome at this station.' He virtually threw me out of the office.\" Joanne is now training to be a nurse. Just before I leave, Dennis asks if I've seen Neil's bedroom. He leads me up the stairs. The room is frozen in time. The bed is made for Neil, with a Valentine's card from his girlfriend, Rachel, by the side. There are three framed photographs of a gleaming-white Vauxhall Nova, and propped against the tape recorder is his registration plate, E398 BGS. There are two bouquets of flowers on the bed. \"It doesn't get any easier. You just learn to hide it better. I wish every police officer involved that night could have met our Neil. He was just . . . very special . . . Even if the police had apologised, I would have thought more of them. If they could have come up here, and said we're sorry.\"",

      "byline": "Liz Jensen",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The origin of the word \"nincompoop\" is unclear, according to the OED, but the explanation I am attached to is that it refers to a man who's never clapped eyes on his wife's pudenda. I like it because it reflects the salient fact of British life that, when it comes to sex, there's always someone who doesn't know their arse from their elbow.</p> <p>For proof, one need go no further than the great 19th-century sex ignoramus John Ruskin, painter, political seer and God look-alike, whose unconsummated marriage to poor Effie remains a source of mirthful specualtion to this day. Was Ruskin's sexual recalcitrance due to the fact that Effie was menstruating on their wedding night, and he didn't know about periods? Or was it the shock of seeing she had pubic hair - in a place where, according to contemporary oil paintings, she should have had either a bald patch or a piece of wispy chiffon? (My heart goes out to the hapless Effie, who had to wait for Ruskin's fellow-artist Millais to come along before she could get a shag. At least he knew what \"having the painters in\" meant.)</p> <p>But even now, when you can't step into a newsagent's without eyeballing at least one set of naked mammary glands, a sub-species of nincompoop remains doggedly alive, like the coelacanth. Barely a day goes by without some gruesomely hilarious tale of a dildo-in-the-dark bride whose husband's wedding tackle turned out to be a load of strap-on baloney, or of a woman who gave birth on the loo, thinking \"it was just wind\". And I wonder how many of the babies posted anonymously into the new \"baby letterbox\" in Hamburg were born to girls whose only problem was a lack of some rather crucial information.</p> <p>I know why I'm so fascinated by stories of this sad genre. While it's merely natural to be interested in what can loosely be classed as \"freakdom\", it's a downright imperative of human nature to focus on the type of freak one could have been oneself. Because, when it comes to nincompoopism, there but for the grace of sex education go I. There are certain areas where the idea of \"less is more\" applies - but for me, and anyone whose \"age of innocence\" went on five years too long, sex education isn't one of them. Yet there's still a righteous mob out there who seems to believe it's not only better to err on the side of sexual ignorance, but to promote it as a teaching aid. I suspect that much of the agonising over the repeal of Clause 28 is born of a fear that our children might actually learn more about sex than we did.</p> <p>For my generation, it would have been difficult to have learned much less. I speak as someone who - unbelievably - didn't learn the facts of life until she was pushing 12. Today, most 11-year-old girls have already had their first period; that hurdle dealt with, they're busy concentrating, quite rightly, on giving up the fags and becoming dot.com millionairesses.</p> <p>At an equivalent age, I was still labouring under the misapprehension that I'd developed somewhere in my mother's digestive tract, after she swallowed a seed from a packet my father had purchased from Cramphorn's Garden Centre. Although the thought of my own parents having sex is creepy enough for me to half-believe this version even now, I confess it didn't do much for my self-esteem to think that I had emerged from the maternal anus. Believe me, learning what gay men did in the bedroom was nothing after that.</p> <p>Even when confronted by the diagrams on page 64 of our biology textbook, I was hopelessly confused. I remember the revulsion I felt as the hydraulics of the sex act finally dawned on me. But worse, the female bits in the labelled diagram (nos. 3, 8 and 11, in particular) didn't seem to correspond to my own anatomy. In short, I was convinced that I didn't have a fanny.</p> <p>\"Girls have three holes,\" the teacher explained, going bright red. Three? Jesus, no! Where? Much investigation ensued, by the end of which my hymen was in tatters.

      "bodyText": "The origin of the word \"nincompoop\" is unclear, according to the OED, but the explanation I am attached to is that it refers to a man who's never clapped eyes on his wife's pudenda. I like it because it reflects the salient fact of British life that, when it comes to sex, there's always someone who doesn't know their arse from their elbow. For proof, one need go no further than the great 19th-century sex ignoramus John Ruskin, painter, political seer and God look-alike, whose unconsummated marriage to poor Effie remains a source of mirthful specualtion to this day. Was Ruskin's sexual recalcitrance due to the fact that Effie was menstruating on their wedding night, and he didn't know about periods? Or was it the shock of seeing she had pubic hair - in a place where, according to contemporary oil paintings, she should have had either a bald patch or a piece of wispy chiffon? (My heart goes out to the hapless Effie, who had to wait for Ruskin's fellow-artist Millais to come along before she could get a shag. At least he knew what \"having the painters in\" meant.) But even now, when you can't step into a newsagent's without eyeballing at least one set of naked mammary glands, a sub-species of nincompoop remains doggedly alive, like the coelacanth. Barely a day goes by without some gruesomely hilarious tale of a dildo-in-the-dark bride whose husband's wedding tackle turned out to be a load of strap-on baloney, or of a woman who gave birth on the loo, thinking \"it was just wind\". And I wonder how many of the babies posted anonymously into the new \"baby letterbox\" in Hamburg were born to girls whose only problem was a lack of some rather crucial information. I know why I'm so fascinated by stories of this sad genre. While it's merely natural to be interested in what can loosely be classed as \"freakdom\", it's a downright imperative of human nature to focus on the type of freak one could have been oneself. Because, when it comes to nincompoopism, there but for the grace of sex education go I. There are certain areas where the idea of \"less is more\" applies - but for me, and anyone whose \"age of innocence\" went on five years too long, sex education isn't one of them. Yet there's still a righteous mob out there who seems to believe it's not only better to err on the side of sexual ignorance, but to promote it as a teaching aid. I suspect that much of the agonising over the repeal of Clause 28 is born of a fear that our children might actually learn more about sex than we did. For my generation, it would have been difficult to have learned much less. I speak as someone who - unbelievably - didn't learn the facts of life until she was pushing 12. Today, most 11-year-old girls have already had their first period; that hurdle dealt with, they're busy concentrating, quite rightly, on giving up the fags and becoming dot.com millionairesses. At an equivalent age, I was still labouring under the misapprehension that I'd developed somewhere in my mother's digestive tract, after she swallowed a seed from a packet my father had purchased from Cramphorn's Garden Centre. Although the thought of my own parents having sex is creepy enough for me to half-believe this version even now, I confess it didn't do much for my self-esteem to think that I had emerged from the maternal anus. Believe me, learning what gay men did in the bedroom was nothing after that. Even when confronted by the diagrams on page 64 of our biology textbook, I was hopelessly confused. I remember the revulsion I felt as the hydraulics of the sex act finally dawned on me. But worse, the female bits in the labelled diagram (nos. 3, 8 and 11, in particular) didn't seem to correspond to my own anatomy. In short, I was convinced that I didn't have a fanny. \"Girls have three holes,\" the teacher explained, going bright red. Three? Jesus, no! Where? Much investigation ensued, by the end of which my hymen was in tatters. The revelations of the biology textbook were followed swiftly by the wisdom of the Little Red Book, the excellent instructions and diagrams in a box of Tampax, many playground discussions and some intensive empirical research. It's the sharpest learning curve I have ever been on. Sadly, though, not sharp enough to prevent my horror a couple of years later when, during some heavy petting under the sheets, my teenage boyfriend appeared suddenly to wet the bed. Ugh! I dumped him at once. What a big baby!

      "bodyText": "Crime levels have not reached biblical proportions just yet but police in Nottingham are taking no chances and have turned to the power of prayer in their fight against crime. The police force has joined with local churches to launch a \"crime prayer-vention scheme\" on a troubled housing estate following a \"successful\" two-year trial in which details of crime trends were passed to local church congregations for \"targeted prayer\". The power of the rapid-response prayer teams was so great, officers claim, that offences have fallen by 10% since the scheme was launched in the Arnold area of Nottingham in 1998. Now the initiative is to be extended to the city's Clifton housing estate, where nine local churches of different denominations have agreed to set aside prayer time to help tackle crime affecting the estate's 30,000 residents. The scheme was the brainchild of Inspector Alan Stuart, an active Christian and lay preacher, who explained: \"The activities of young people are by far the biggest number of complaints from the public. I asked the churches in Arnold to pray about the issue. Since it has been running, crime in the area has fallen by 10%.\" He added: \"Youth crime has dropped against local and national levels. The only thing we are doing differently in Arnold is praying.\" Insp Stuart said offences involving under-17s have dropped from 130, when the scheme began, to 80 last year, while car crime had also fallen. The new scheme will see a combined congregation of more than 1,000 parishioners praying for an end to burglary, criminal damage and car theft on the estate. While the scheme attempts to harness the spiritual power of prayer, it also uses the latest technology, with churches receiving information about crime problems through faxes and e-mails sent by a council co-ordinator. The Rev Lesley de Pomerai, vicar at St Francis Church, Clifton, confessed to being \"very excited\" about the scheme, saying: \"The police authority has been totally amazed by the results; there is no other explanation for what has happened apart from the prayer.\" She added: \"This is unique and the vision of very enlightened officers.

Lottery money for good causes is pooled in the fund before being given to the distributing organisations. There have been heated exchanges between campaigners and Sport England, responsible for distributing lottery money to the sports. Campaigners claim that almost \u00a3331m has not been distributed or even committed, resulting in many sports projects being starved of cash. They also claim that in total \u00a31.713bn is lying idle in the pooled fund. A number of MPs are to ask questions about the money in the Commons on Monday and are demanding that Mr Smith state the exact amount not committed to any good causes. An early day motion has also been tabled. A lottery campaigner, Denis Vaughn, said: \"It's a disgrace that this money has not been put to any good uses. We are not saying that it is not accounted for, but it has not been spent or awarded. \"The problem is partly the delay in getting the money to the causes. The whole lottery distribution system is not businesslike; it is run by bureaucrats who are over-cautious.\" Organisations such as Sport England have spent the past few weeks dismissing the allegations, claiming that all the money they have in their coffers has been committed to future projects. A spokesman said: \"There is no way the money is just sitting there not committed to anything. Part of the problem is the way we award money. We do not just write a cheque and hand it over. The money is with us, and we give it to the good cause once we have seen the invoices and the claim is checked by our compliance unit. \"We have also got a number of big projects on the go and around 300 others which we have approved that will require payment any time now.\" In total Sport England has received \u00a31.3bn from the lottery, of which it claims to have spent \u00a3853m, with another \u00a3657m committed. \"We have in fact over-committed ourselves,\" said the spokesman. \"We have sat down with the parties that have complained about our handling of the money and explained what is happening with the money.\" Campaigners such as Mr Vaughn claim that both the government and Sport England are playing with words to mask the uncommitted money. Mr Vaughn said: \"They can say what they like about promising money, but unless it's actually going out there and working for good causes it's not doing anyone any good.\"",

      "bodyText": "The theft of your personal identity promises to become the new target for criminals, according to an official report on future crime trends, published today. The study suggests that in the hi-tech world of the next two decades, cash, computers, digital televisions and cameras will become less attractive to steal, as they will not function without the identity of the legal owner. Further advances in tagging and immobilising material possessions mean that the bottom will drop out of the stolen goods market. In this situation it is your personalised identity - such as PIN numbers, chips and mobile phone SIM cards - that could become your most valuable asset. The market is already beginning to recognise that it is access to online and electronic services that counts. Hardware such as some mobile phones or digital television decoders, which were once a target for thieves, is now being given away free as a way of attracting customers to the services.

Geoffrey Guy, chairman of GW Pharmaceuticals, which has two Home Office licences to research the medical uses of the drug, said the company had completed the first human trials in November. Dr Guy said the firm soon expected to start clinical trials in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis and other conditions which bring severe pain, including spinal chord injury and neuralgia. The company is testing a cannabis-based prescription medicine that would give patients the medical benefits of dope but without the \"unwanted psychoactive side effects\" - or the high - and without the health dangers associated with smoking. It is expected the trials, which involve 2,000 volunteers, will take a further two to three years to complete. Downing Street and the Home Office rejected reports yesterday that a deal had been struck between Tony Blair, Mo Mowlam and Jack Straw that the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes would be given the go-ahead later this year. The cabinet office minister wanted a government-ordered review of whether cannabis should be decriminalised while the home secretary is adamantly opposed to any relaxation of the drug laws. Downing Street reiterated yesterday that the prime minister was waiting to see the results of the clinical trials before any decision was arrived at. The long awaited Police Foundation inquiry into the future of the drug laws is expected to recommend that prison should no longer be used to punish cannabis offenders and that ecstasy should no longer be treated as a class A drug which attracts the same penalties as heroin. Dr Guy said that the newspaper reports had simply confirmed the \"government's long-held view that it intends to allow cannabis-based medicines to be prescribed to patients once clinical trials are completed. \"GW's trials aim to demonstrate quality, safety, and efficacy to the satisfaction of the medicines control agency. \"The reports provide further reassurance that once MCA approval is obtained for cannabis-based medicines, the government will reschedule these products so as to allow prescription use.\" The Home Office minister, Lord Williams, told the company early in 1998 that \"if and when the benefits of cannabis-based medicine are scientifically demonstrated... the government would be willing to propose an amendment to the misuse of drugs legislation to allow the prescription of such medicine.\" A Home Office spokesman confirmed yesterday that the policy had not changed. GW Pharmaceuticals grew its first crop of 5,000 cannabis plants last summer in a secret greenhouse in the south of England.

      "bodyText": "For more than a century men have worn the trousers on the shop floor of the John Lewis department stores. But the chain is bowing to employee pressure and will allow its 14,000 female staff to wear trousers in an effort to update its image. Luke Mayhew, the group's new director of trading for department stores, has announced that design consultants have been asked to come up with a sharp new look for the 21st century. The proposed changes to the uniform have delighted female sales staff in its 25 stores nationwide who have been campaigning for the right to wear trousers, complaining that tights worn with the skirts are too hot in the summer and the skirts too cold in winter. The move also follows two recent incidents in which Eurostar and the Professional Golfers' Association faced sex discrimination cases over banning female employees from wearing trousers. For several years, female sales staff at John Lewis have branded their traditional outfits of blue skirts with jackets and green blouses \"old fashioned and boring\". Their male counterparts are allowed a wider range of choices in their wardrobe with a choice of business suits, they argue. The abolition of the skirts-only rule after 136 years also follows a lengthy campaign in the group's weekly in-house publication, the Gazette, about the dresscode for women on the shop floor. One staff member wrote: \"I am a behind-the-scenes female partner and would like the option to wear trousers if I so wish. Although Emmeline Pankhurst died over 60 years ago, the prejudice against women continues.\" Mr Mayhew has said a study of \"business dress\" and in particular whether women staff should wear \"suitable\" trousers would be carried out as a review of the group's corporate identity. He confirmed the group is also considering redesigning store signs, carrier bags, packaging and stationery. The move comes at a time when big name chainstores are under pressure to join the e-commerce boom. The modernisation also echoes plans by arch rival Marks &amp; Spencer which on Wednesday announced an overhaul of its brand and new staff uniforms. \"We have no plans to alter dramatically the current, very successful identity, but we do need to look at ways it can be updated and refreshed for the future,\" Mr Mayhew said in his annual report to the group's central council. John Lewis has been forced to review its corporate image after one of the most difficult trading years for the group where it suffered a steep fall in trading profits in the first half while pressure rose from employees for the group to demutualise. Last night a John Lewis spokesman confirmed there would be a trouser option for female sales staff as part of the group's \"refreshed\" image but stressed customer considerations would mean the change had to be a gradual process. \"All our market research suggests that there are still some quite traditional views among our customers and that really has to drive what we do. All the airlines still have skirts for their female staff,\" Mr Williams said. \"We hope it will be an evolutionary thing rather than a sudden shock to the system. The store is very keen to continue to present a smart, professional image but trousers will be an option as this review rolls through.\"",

      "bodyText": "Frenzied competition among telecom companies to own a licence for the next generation of mobile phones could deliver a \u00a310bn windfall to the government, analysts said last night. The licences are extremely valuable to telecom companies that want to offer their customers video clips on their phones as well as an internet connection so they can perform tasks such as online banking, shopping or booking a train ticket. Five mobile phone operators, including BT, Vodafone and Orange, have submitted bids of over \u00a31bn for two of the licences. The government would have to raise the basic tax rate by about 4p in the pound if it wanted to get an equivalent amount of money. The auction, which is due to run over four to six weeks, has just finished its third week, with 13 companies still fighting for the five licences. A total of \u00a34.6bn has been offered so far, yet yesterday some industry experts were suggesting this would soar to \u00a310bn. If it goes to that figure - 20 times some of its internal estimates - the risk is that telecom companies will charge customers high prices for the new smart phones to recoup the cost. Economists said such a windfall could help to bankroll the government's public spending initiatives on the National Health Service and education revealed in the Budget this week. The Treasury would not say yesterday what estimate it had used in the Budget's Red Book of forecasts. It said the figure had been obscured so the auction process would not be comprised. A subsidiary of the Irish phone company Eircom had put in the highest bid yesterday - \u00a31.15bn, which was almost matched by BT at \u00a31.1bn. Hans Sanders, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said: \"All the existing mobile phone operators are very eager to get a licence and that means they might pay very high prices. \"I'm a little surprised at the prices prepared to be paid, but not totally.

Some economists remained sceptical of the process getting to \u00a310bn. Phil Shaw, economist at Investec Henderson Crosthwaite, said the government would not use the money for a tax cut because it was a one-off bonanza.

First there was the platform for economic stability, one of his favourite phrases.

But this week he was able to report that 1.2m are being rescued thanks to Labour's policies.

It is the Tories who fear it. \"By spreading cynicism they can make it impossible for the government to make big changes. The cynicism they are trying to engender is because we are trying to make big changes, not because we are not.''</p> <p> The money is there, so the \u00a34bn going into schools and hospitals has come from lower debt payments and a cut in social security spending. \"We don't have to fall for the Tory argument that privatisation is the only way forward.\" </p> <p> Instead, building a consensus around better public services is the way to show Labour is the party of the many, not the few, in the run-up to the election. </p> <p> Dubbing the Tories the party of insidious privatisers, the chancellor insists: \"The NHS, which we built, can be modernised for the 21st century. We don't need to fall for the argument that the only way forward is compulsory health insurance, where most operations are outside the NHS, where there are huge charges if you are inside the health service, and where the dismembered parts would be thrown to people in the stock exchange if the Tories had their way.\"</p> <p> But what about the argument that many of the health service's problems were caused by his parsimony, that he is now being forced to deal both with the legacy of underfunding and a sense of disillusionment among voters? Brown is unmoved. He sidesteps questions about Ken Livingstone's seemingly unstoppable momentum to become mayor of London - \"let's see how the election goes\" - and the implication that it is another symptom of disappointment among voters.</p> <p> He rattles off his list of improvements which will benefit regional economies - \u00a312bn for infrastructure projects, for instance - and poorer people within them.

Callisthenics-wise, it's somewhere between an insouciant, perfectly balanced cat leaping from rooftop to rooftop, the Watusi, and the crowd at an early Grandmaster Flash gig. Are these men insiders planted for the good of the band - clandestine, expertly choreographed versions of Happy Monday's Bez? Or do they just come here every week and do this for fun? I want to ask them, but I'm rooted to the spot, mesmerised, and, besides, they seem so intoxicated, so locked into the groove, I wouldn't want to get in the way. </p> <p>Five minutes previously, I'd decided that the Mighty Imperials, who wear the uniform of the prom-night bands you find in films like American Graffiti and Animal House and play stripped-down, deep-fried instrumental funk, were the most exciting, stylish and erudite teenage band I'd seen since, well... ever. But, as my mind began to float free and my behind begged to follow, a little authenticity alarm kept on keeping on: is this OK - four preppy, goody-goody white kids from Y2K New York pretending to be four raunchy, superbad black men from 1973 New Orleans? The answer came from stage right and as it did, the remainder of the largely white crowd loosened up and surrendered to the Hammond organ. </p> <p>The fact that I betrayed my \"if it feels good do it\" sensibilities by questioning, just in a tiny way, whether it was OK to like something makes me feel pitiful. But that's being a music fan today, isn't it? Pop is so fragmented and regenerative that committing to a band involves endless introspection: \"Are they a bit retro?\" \"Should they be doing this if they're white?\" \"Is this credible?\" \"Isn't the lead singer mates with that tosser out of Placebo?\" You can't admit you like something because it fondles something deep and spiritual inside of you, because you trust your soul and it gave the thumbs up. That would make you a sad old hippie, wouldn't it? </p> <p>\"Retro\", as a put down, will always be an oversimplification. For example: the Mighty Imperials sound exactly like the Meters and they're brilliant; the Stereophonics don't sound exactly like anyone else and they're crap. Plus, how can you ever claim to be futuristic and cool when the supposedly \"futuristic and cool\" music - techno, rap, electronica - is often the most lazily retroactive of all? Once you realise this, and that everyone hip has a shady link to someone desperately unhip somewhere down the line, credibility becomes something incredibly difficult to draw up plans for. </p> <p>There are no rules any more. Genres no longer serve as badges of musical authenticity: mod has nothing to do with modernism, R&amp;B now seems to stand for Rumps and Buns, power pop refers to one of the most creative yet worst-selling musical forms in the western world, and dance is a description for music that makes no contact whatsoever with the lower part of your body. I have particular trouble trying to understand that last one: define dance music as something you can swivel and strut and wiggle and grin to, and you're uncool. </p> <p>The Mighty Imperials play real dance music that you can reach out and touch, and should be the first band of the post-cred era, where cool is a sticker you wear deep down, purely to impress your own spirit. If it's good enough for the acrobatic soul children of James Brown, who round off the night simulating a balletic standoff between a bottle of mineral water and two cheetahs, it's good enough for me.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In today's cultural supermarket, in which accessibility is obligatory and irony essential, you take your pick off the shelves as you wheel your trolley down the aisle marked \"culture\" or \"lifestyle\" or \"entertainment\" and you find a small corner, just by the cat food and the dog biscuits, marked \"theatre\". Theatre will always appear unfashionable in a society that is conspicuous for its formlessness, and its concern with the frailty of being human will always look defenceless when set against blockbuster movies, or the confident certainties of politics or journalism. </p> <p>To sit in a theatre audience demands a sort of commitment - you have to bring something to the party and if the party's bad, as it often is, and not just bad but head-burningly, ball-breakingly, bowel-churningly excruciating, it makes you angry with despair, furious that time has been stolen from you without reward. It makes you doubt that the theatre can ever be worthwhile. You can, as I have, read countless bad novels and dribble away embarrassingly large swathes of your life watching rotten films, but you don't conclude from these experiences that fiction and the cinema are irredeemably dud means of artistic expression. With the theatre you always have to travel in hope and prepare for disappointment. </p> <p>But that is a virtue: it means that the stakes are very high. And just as theatre can make you angry when it's bad, it can make you elated when it is good. And, what is more, it has the power to disturb. To get under the skin. </p> <p>Theatre is often regarded in Britain as the cricket of the performing arts - meaning archaic, quaint, thinly attended, and not done as well as it used to be. It is true that after a century of unparalleled vigour and invention in the British theatre, it now seems subdued: a landscape of uncertainty under a cloud of anxiety. But is all experiment over? Is there no adventure, no ambition, no courage, no politics, no spirituality? Does career triumph over vocation, celebrity over achievement? </p> <p>The news is not all bad: at the start of the 21st century, tourists flock to London to see \"our wonderful theatre\", British writers and actors dominate Broadway, British directors are feted in Hollywood and on the international jetset circuit. The French-Canadian writer and director, Robert Lepage, said this to me a few weeks ago: \"In the next few years we'll be amazed how theatre and film will have to live together, because film can't continue in the form it is, in the way it's presented. People want direct life, three-dimensional interaction, and that's something that belongs to the theatre. The theatre will still continue to be the mother art, and it will be enriched by so many aesthetic, technical, ideological revolutions that it will be even richer and even more alive; and even more ephemeral.\" </p> <p>I think he's right. The theatre will continue to evolve and, as John Osborne said, it will also \"simply go on dying, as it has done for centuries. Like everything else in life.\" But recently it's come to seem as if one has to be a very wilful optimist to believe that the dying body of British theatre is going to make a miraculous recovery. This body is atrophying largely, it might appear, through consistent lack of financial support, which has induced a lack of confidence and ambition, leading to poor work, which has been rewarded with poor audiences. </p> <p>However, money is clearly far from the only problem. The anatomy of the theatre for many years has been infected by the universal virus of the times: impatience and opportunism. Actors and directors who might previously have been content to do a year or two in a repertory theatre looked anxiously for jobs on television, in films or the national companies, and the previous de facto form of apprenticeship for actors in smaller repertory theatres started to disappear. </p> <p>And the audience has changed. No theatre now can count on a \"theatre-going constituency\". These have vanished in the same way congregations have vanished from churches. And a whole generation, or two, of potential theatregoers has been weaned on the intermittent demands of television and video games and been empowered by the use of the remote control to become hanging judges, impatient with any idea that takes more than a few minutes to develop. So, leaving aside considerations of background and education, swathes of the population have become resistant to the idea of any activity that requires an act of concentration combined with an obligation to become part of a large social group. </p> <p>If money is not the only problem, it's also not the only solution - it's not an alchemical substance that transforms dull theatre into good. But theatre, even at its crudest, requires money for buildings, technical equipment, technicians, administration, front of house staff, stage management, directors, writers and, above all, performers. </p> <p>If we want a theatre that takes artistic risks, sustains the best of tradition, develops new talent, feeds the commercial theatre and does all this at seat prices which don't exclude all but the rich, then we have no alternative but to seek state support. Nearly two years ago I was present at a meeting at 10 Downing Street, at which the prime minister listened patiently and considerately to a number of people in the arts world who made, in my view - and, I think, his - a reasoned case for raising the priority of the arts in funding terms, in education and in public perception. \"The arts,\" said the prime minister at the end of the meeting, \"will be put at the core of the government's thinking.\" I'm still waiting for evidence of this promise but I'm not holding my breath. </p> <p>Refusing to take a stand to say that the arts are not elitist is to condone the sheer shoddiness of much popular culture and implicitly to consign us all to the worst aspects of consumer capitalism. But it's market forces, innit? Perhaps the government, who seem to have more than an eye on posterity, would care to debate this proposition of Ruskin: \"Great nations write their autobiographies in three manuscripts, the book of their deeds, the book of their words and the book of their art. Not one of these books can be understood unless we read the other two, but of these three, the only trustworthy one is the last.\" </p> <p>The government's diffidence towards the arts has translated into financial terms: our expectations of greatly improved status and resources have dwindled and died. The revenue funding for theatres in this country - excluding one-off stabilisation grants from the lottery - by the end of the financial year 2001, will have decreased in real terms over the period since the brave new dawn of May 1997 by 0.4%. </p> <p>One of the consequences of the unfriendly climate towards the arts in the 1980s was that the Arts Council - and theatres themselves - started to make the argument for their existence, not through the power of art, its ability to enchant and entertain, but on the grounds of its social usefulness. Despised and starved of funds by government, despaired of by its clients, the Arts Council took refuge in a proliferation of planning initiatives, incentives, scrutinies and strategies. While we would all agree that publicly funded theatres should be accountable, accessible and cost-effective, there has been an excessive concern with social engineering and marketing initiatives at the expense of the art. </p> <p>At Nottingham Playhouse, a not untypical regional theatre, they have tried hard, in good faith, to fulfil the Arts Council's aims. The consequence is that where 20 years ago just over 40% of expenditure went into putting productions on stage, the figure is now 25%. And where 25% of expenditure was on actors, the figure is now 8.4%. Where there were writers, actors and directors, there are now \"planning executives\", \"producers\", \"public art programmer directors\", \"development managers\", \"marketing officers\", \"project co-ordinators\", \"outreach officers\". </p> <p>Let's assume that we have roughly the same amount of grant, and that the traditional Arts Council line of least resistance - the strategy of \"equal misery for all\" - is finally agreed to benefit no one. </p> <p>I would propose a plan, that might, I suppose, be described as Napoleonic: the funding of theatre in England needs to be centrally planned and directed. The Arts Council should introduce agreements with artistic directors on a contract basis: an artistic programme would have to be submitted, accompanied by a business plan. The programme would not be a manifesto but a description of policy underwritten by the only two precepts which matter in a theatre, one from George Devine, the other from Brecht: \"Policy is who you work with\", and \"The proof of the pudding is in the eating\". The Arts Council's commitment to the agreement would be made on criteria of quality, previous experience, ambition, vision and talent. Good performers would be rewarded, and weak ones be replaced. Some theatres might not continue to receive funding; some only on condition that the work improved. The artistic director would be offered index-linked, fixed-term funding for periods of four years, to be reviewed at the half-way stage with no guarantee of renewal unless the agreed criteria were being fulfilled. </p> <p>The funding of the cost of buildings would be split from the cost of the arts they serve, which would give the public and the government a clearer picture of what the buildings cost to maintain and what the art costs to sustain. The art should be funded centrally, the buildings locally. </p> <p>In order to implement what I propose, a single person would need to be appointed. He or she would need to be prepared to be authoritative, confident, decisive and interventionist - as Arts Council officers were 25 years ago - with a mandate to direct appointments, to fix the level of grant, to recommend closures, and to cajole, defend, exhort and encourage. You could, if you had to, call this person a \"theatre tsar\". The title is not important: the power is. This person - preferably a respected theatre practitioner - would be advised by a panel: a committee composed of theatre professionals. The panel would be advisory rather than prescriptive, the servants of the tsar rather than the masters. After taking advice from the panel, decisions would be made by the theatre tsar and ratified, or not, by the council. </p> <p>Hard choices would have to be made, hunches backed, money allocated based on the quality of the work, which would overarch questions of accountability, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility. The tsar would publicly have to justify and defend decisions: the theatre would have a champion, the public would have an advocate and the Arts Council would have a comprehensible function. Respect of the artists - can we stop calling them \"clients\"? - for the officers will only develop if the officers are seen to possess sufficient expertise in their respective art forms and if the decision-making process is transparent, based on the quality of the work and not on specious social criteria, money, marketing or management. </p> <p>Who is our theatre for? A theatre without an audience is as pointless as an unguided missile. We speak of everybody having the \"choice\" of going to the theatre, but it's a tragedy that those who choose always seem to come from so limited a social spectrum because, of course, the \"choice\" of going to the theatre or, indeed, the opera, or an art gallery hasn't been offered to most people in this country. Most young people are not taken to the theatre by their parents or their schools or colleges, and feel that theatre-going is not for them. If they feel anything at all about the theatre, they feel disenfranchised. </p> <p>The consequence of this disaffection is that politicians have been able to dismiss the theatre as an irredeemably elitist activity, and theatres have been swept into the turbulent eddies of arguments with funding bodies whose hearts can't agree with their heads, who have urged charging \"what the market will stand for tickets, and advocated more developed marketing\" to target the middle-class audience, while at the same time pressing for greater access and audience development. </p> <p> All the performing arts provoke accusations of elitism: they are dedicated to creating work that can be performed by only a very few, very gifted and very skilful people to an audience limited by the number of people who can sit in a concert hall, a theatre or an opera house at any one time. The use of elitism as a pejorative is only justified if the work seeks to obscure rather than illuminate, and if the performers are reluctant to communicate - or if the concert hall, theatre or opera house appears to repel a prospective audience through excessively high prices or a selectively exclusive attitude to the public. But access does not, or should not, mean lowest common denominator. We have to remember that art is not universal; it doesn't mean the same to everyone. And it is not necessarily better if it is universal: just think of the film Titanic. </p> <p>The power to engender real access to the theatre can only be achieved in three ways. First, through education: by putting drama in the core curriculum, by funding theatre visits, by supporting more extensive work by educational departments and by nourishing the much debilitated theatre-in-education initiatives. Second, through touring: by extending the frequency and reach of touring to large and small-scale venues. Third, and most important, through the box office: by funding theatres on a permanent, or part-time basis, to lower ticket prices to match those of cinemas. </p> <p>In the end, even if all the mechanics of social engineering can be achieved and fine-tuned; if, as Chekhov said \"the people are brought up to the level of Gogol, instead of Gogol brought down to the level of the people\", and if the financial ecology could be made stable, the theatre has to live up to our propaganda for it. </p> <p>We have to make theatre which exploits its irreproducible elements, which proclaims the virtues of its liveness and its uniqueness, which combines the elements of time, space, light, speech, music, and storytelling, which ravishes the eyes and enchants the soul, and has the desire and ability to enlarge the imagination as much as to entertain. This can only be achieved by restoring to health the anatomy of our theatre, regional and national, and that can only be achieved by decisive intervention. We must remember that nothing can live in the theatre that is not conceived out of passion, nurtured on obsession and educated in enthusiasm. </p> <p>We live in an age in which economies have become bulimic, sex has become public wallpaper, and giants stalk the globe - corporations, political leaders, showbiz icons. We need to be reminded of our humanity. We need to express our humanity. All art is a way of doing that, but theatre is the most human art form because it can never dissolve the scale of the human figure and the sound of the human voice. </p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract from the first annual LAMDA Lecture, given in London this week by Sir Richard Eyre at the Royal Institute of Great Britain.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In today's cultural supermarket, in which accessibility is obligatory and irony essential, you take your pick off the shelves as you wheel your trolley down the aisle marked \"culture\" or \"lifestyle\" or \"entertainment\" and you find a small corner, just by the cat food and the dog biscuits, marked \"theatre\". Theatre will always appear unfashionable in a society that is conspicuous for its formlessness, and its concern with the frailty of being human will always look defenceless when set against blockbuster movies, or the confident certainties of politics or journalism. To sit in a theatre audience demands a sort of commitment - you have to bring something to the party and if the party's bad, as it often is, and not just bad but head-burningly, ball-breakingly, bowel-churningly excruciating, it makes you angry with despair, furious that time has been stolen from you without reward. It makes you doubt that the theatre can ever be worthwhile. You can, as I have, read countless bad novels and dribble away embarrassingly large swathes of your life watching rotten films, but you don't conclude from these experiences that fiction and the cinema are irredeemably dud means of artistic expression. With the theatre you always have to travel in hope and prepare for disappointment. But that is a virtue: it means that the stakes are very high. And just as theatre can make you angry when it's bad, it can make you elated when it is good. And, what is more, it has the power to disturb. To get under the skin. Theatre is often regarded in Britain as the cricket of the performing arts - meaning archaic, quaint, thinly attended, and not done as well as it used to be. It is true that after a century of unparalleled vigour and invention in the British theatre, it now seems subdued: a landscape of uncertainty under a cloud of anxiety. But is all experiment over? Is there no adventure, no ambition, no courage, no politics, no spirituality? Does career triumph over vocation, celebrity over achievement? The news is not all bad: at the start of the 21st century, tourists flock to London to see \"our wonderful theatre\", British writers and actors dominate Broadway, British directors are feted in Hollywood and on the international jetset circuit. The French-Canadian writer and director, Robert Lepage, said this to me a few weeks ago: \"In the next few years we'll be amazed how theatre and film will have to live together, because film can't continue in the form it is, in the way it's presented. People want direct life, three-dimensional interaction, and that's something that belongs to the theatre. The theatre will still continue to be the mother art, and it will be enriched by so many aesthetic, technical, ideological revolutions that it will be even richer and even more alive; and even more ephemeral.\" I think he's right. The theatre will continue to evolve and, as John Osborne said, it will also \"simply go on dying, as it has done for centuries. Like everything else in life.\" But recently it's come to seem as if one has to be a very wilful optimist to believe that the dying body of British theatre is going to make a miraculous recovery. This body is atrophying largely, it might appear, through consistent lack of financial support, which has induced a lack of confidence and ambition, leading to poor work, which has been rewarded with poor audiences. However, money is clearly far from the only problem. The anatomy of the theatre for many years has been infected by the universal virus of the times: impatience and opportunism. Actors and directors who might previously have been content to do a year or two in a repertory theatre looked anxiously for jobs on television, in films or the national companies, and the previous de facto form of apprenticeship for actors in smaller repertory theatres started to disappear. And the audience has changed. No theatre now can count on a \"theatre-going constituency\". These have vanished in the same way congregations have vanished from churches. And a whole generation, or two, of potential theatregoers has been weaned on the intermittent demands of television and video games and been empowered by the use of the remote control to become hanging judges, impatient with any idea that takes more than a few minutes to develop. So, leaving aside considerations of background and education, swathes of the population have become resistant to the idea of any activity that requires an act of concentration combined with an obligation to become part of a large social group. If money is not the only problem, it's also not the only solution - it's not an alchemical substance that transforms dull theatre into good. But theatre, even at its crudest, requires money for buildings, technical equipment, technicians, administration, front of house staff, stage management, directors, writers and, above all, performers. If we want a theatre that takes artistic risks, sustains the best of tradition, develops new talent, feeds the commercial theatre and does all this at seat prices which don't exclude all but the rich, then we have no alternative but to seek state support.

But it is a crucial link in the bridge between the unsubsidised new-writing outlets and the high-profile venues. </p> <p>After a frustrating period of homelessness, Soho's new \u00a310.5m theatre and writers' centre has now opened. With the brouhaha surrounding the Court's reopening, the company took what seemed the sensible decision to start with a four-week season of four new plays by new writers. The works have been rehearsed for only a week and productions are minimalist. </p> <p>But after seeing the first two plays in the season, Jonathan Lichtenstein's Station and Holly Phillips's Billy and the Crab Lady, I am wondering whether the plush new building in glamorous Dean Street will change the context in which we see Soho's work, and not just eat away at the right to fail but change the kind of play and writer that Soho encourages. If it does, it could have an adverse effect on the delicate ecology of new writing. </p> <p>I worry because Phillips's Billy and the Crab Lady, currently playing, looks horribly exposed. Clearly such a short rehearsal period has done writer and cast no favours at all. This is a story of rivalry and revenge between two flatmates - the big-headed, big-mouthed Fred and the self-effacing Bri - that comes to a head with the arrival of Kat, whom they both fancy. It may be snapped up by a TV company that recognises its sitcom potential, but makes for an unbearably glib and predictable 90 minutes in the theatre. It needed a workshop, maybe a makeover, but definitely not an audience. </p> <p>There was less to worry about with Lichtenstein's Station, the opening play of the season. Beautifully written, although inclined towards the precious, it represented a confident debut from the kind of promising new writer that Soho is so good at unearthing. </p> <p>Peter, a troubled English music student, turns up in the Berlin flat of Eva, the German Jewish grandmother he has never met, in search of himself and his roots. It is 1989 and the wall between east and west has just come down, but Eva is keeping a wall around her own past, particularly the events of 50 years before, when she was a brilliant pianist in Hitler's Germany. But as Peter persists in questioning the prickly, dying Eva, the past comes alive and a Sophie's Choice-type story of friendship, betrayal, survival and guilt unfolds. </p> <p>There was nothing rough and ready about this production. Tom Piper's simple design effortlessly evoked both past and present, and Abigail Morris's gut-twisting but infinitely delicate production got performances to match. </p> <p>Lichtenstein is clearly a more mature writer than Phillips, but this was still an infant work. In the long term, will plays such as this still get the chance to take their place on the stage of Dean Street, or will critics and audiences come to expect works as stylish as the building? </p> <p>Of course, wonderful new buildings such as the Soho Theatre are to be welcomed: it does people no more good to work in crumbling, ill-equipped theatres than it does writers to starve in garrets. But Soho needs to be very careful that \u00a310.5m of bricks and mortar doesn't alter the whole context in which its work is seen. </p> <p>\u0095 Billy and the Crab Lady closes tonight.

Peter, a troubled English music student, turns up in the Berlin flat of Eva, the German Jewish grandmother he has never met, in search of himself and his roots. It is 1989 and the wall between east and west has just come down, but Eva is keeping a wall around her own past, particularly the events of 50 years before, when she was a brilliant pianist in Hitler's Germany. But as Peter persists in questioning the prickly, dying Eva, the past comes alive and a Sophie's Choice-type story of friendship, betrayal, survival and guilt unfolds. There was nothing rough and ready about this production. Tom Piper's simple design effortlessly evoked both past and present, and Abigail Morris's gut-twisting but infinitely delicate production got performances to match. Lichtenstein is clearly a more mature writer than Phillips, but this was still an infant work. In the long term, will plays such as this still get the chance to take their place on the stage of Dean Street, or will critics and audiences come to expect works as stylish as the building? Of course, wonderful new buildings such as the Soho Theatre are to be welcomed: it does people no more good to work in crumbling, ill-equipped theatres than it does writers to starve in garrets. But Soho needs to be very careful that \u00a310.5m of bricks and mortar doesn't alter the whole context in which its work is seen. \u0095 Billy and the Crab Lady closes tonight.

      "body": "<p>In the summer of 1748 the painter William Hogarth, on a visit to France, paused to make some sketches of the old city gate of Calais. Suddenly he felt a hand on his shoulder and was marched off on suspicion of being a spy. He did not enjoy his interrogation and, once safely back in England, took his revenge - by painting. </p> <p>The Gate of Calais, part of Roast Beef and Liberty, a new exhibition at the relaunched Tate Britain, shows a magnificent piece of British beef. The meat is destined for an English inn, and it is being slavered over by the French, whose monks alone are fat. In the right foreground a Jacobite refugee makes do with an onion. In the background on the left Hogarth has depicted himself just at the moment when he feels a hand on his shoulder, his sketching about to be unpleasantly interrupted. </p> <p>A print of the painting was made for mass consumption, subtitled O the Roast Beef of Old England, a reference to a jingoistic song written by Hogarth's friend Henry Fielding. There was even a cantata composed as a commentary on the picture, telling of the beef's short journey through the streets of Calais and the envious responses to it of our deluded enemies, the French, and Irish and Scottish rebels, as they watch it go by. </p> <p>The Tate Britain exhibition is about xenophobia and national identity in art, and The Gate of Calais indeed seems the most blatant and obnoxious propaganda, about as subtle as a German picture in Germany of Germans parading their BMWs through the ruins of Longbridge. </p> <p>It gets worse. Hogarth was a member of the Sublime Society of Beefsteaks, who gathered to eat a ritual meal of the rarest beef while singing anti-French songs. In fact, not only is the picture obvious; obviousness is its very message. Poor starving foreigners, forget what your heads tell you and what your hearts believe; know the simple truth revealed by your saliva-glands - British is best. </p> <p>It wouldn't be so bad if beef was merely symbolic, but our worst enemies seemed to agree we were indeed fortunate in our access to meat. The French honour us twice by calling us Rosbifs - firstly because the thing itself, roast beef, is such a splendid thing, and then because they have to borrow from our language even to speak of it, acknowledging how thoroughly English it is and how unFrench. </p> <p>It derives from a compliment, grudging but not back-handed, that the English may not know how to cook but they certainly know how to roast a joint. Our cattle were much better fed, better looked after and slaughtered younger than their continental cousins. Countless travellers observed the superiority of our meat as well as its amazing quantity. Even after the occupation of Paris in 1815 when the French were reconciled to things English and introduced for the first time to bifteck \u00e0 l'anglaise , you still had to go to England to taste it at its finest, according to Dumas p\u00e8re , who often made the journey. </p> <p>We return the favour by calling the French Frogs, consumers of watery amphibious creatures born out of slime, a food for scavengers, a substitute not for beef even but for chicken, a food of such meagre nourishment that it produces the characteristic French form, caricatured by Hogarth and in many of the cartoons in the Tate's exhibition: drippy and thin and froggish, the opposite of hearty John Bull. </p> <p>Clearly the French are not nearly so happy being frogs as the English are being beef. French doctors, like their English counterparts, considered frogs unwholesome and tried to discourage their consumption; France's own renaissance intellectual Bernard Palissy considered frogs among the lowest forms of life and observed that, naturally, very few people actually liked to eat them. Long after frogs had fought their way to the table, the great chef Escoffier preferred to disguise them with the name nymphes , considering grenouilles too vulgar a term for haute cuisine. </p> <p>Roast beef, on the other hand was a prize worth having long before the British seized it. Right at the beginnings of European literature, we find that Homer feeds Achilles and all his hunky heroes on nothing else, as Fielding, for one, was fully aware. In contrast, non-Europeans, such as the Egyptians, worshipped cows - preposterously - and the head of the animal was cursed when killed. If there were Greeks in town it was sold to them; if not, it was thrown into the Nile and allowed to float off downstream. </p> <p>Roasting on a spit, the simplest method of cooking, was as important, ideologically, as the beef; pots and pans were deeply suspicious objects for Plato, reeking of cuisine and unnatural complexity. What serious army would be bothered to carry them around? And if Europeans have long been distinguished as carnivores in general and have often shocked those they colonised by the sheer quantity of animals they killed, the beefeating English must be the most European of Europeans. For beef is the meatmost meat, at the pinnacle of carnivorousness. Next in the hierarchy is lamb (as in that unusual dish rosbif d'agneau ). Frogs, the closest you can get to fish without swimming, are to be found on the very bottom rung. </p> <p>A Greek comic poet, 2,000 years before Hogarth, reflected his distaste for the playwright Euripides, all sauces and lechery, by comparing him unfavourably to a real piece of meat. And if beef is manly and warlike it has also long indicated substance itself - which helps to explain its small but important role in the history of art. </p> <p>For Hogarth beef represents a basic truth, the heart of British values, \"the beef\". He may, in fact, have been alluding to Rembrandt's Slaughtered Ox, where a side of beef fills the entire frame. And in the 20s the Jewish artist Chaim Soutine did his own version, enormous and lurid, pure paint. He contemplated the carcass for so long that the neighbours complained about the smell. (Apparently the police were called, and they advised Soutine on how to preserve the animal in formaldehyde.) Finally, one needs no reminding of the bovine output of Hogarth's modern descendant, Damien Hirst. It is as if each artist in turn was asking himself the same question - \"Where's the beef?\" - and coming up with ever more painfully obvious answers - \"Here it is\", \"Here it is\", \"Here it is\" - stuffing dead cows in the viewer's face. </p> <p>\"To cry roast meat,\" however, was a proverb in Hogarth's time that meant to draw attention, obnoxiously and foolishly, to a piece of good fortune. Underneath all this self-confidence lies a deep insecurity. You don't have to be a vegetarian to see there is something a little excessive in the Georgian cult of beef. If meat is murder, rare beef is the bloodiest kind, and among those many travellers who complimented us on our meat were several who believed we ate it raw. If the French are frogs because of the \"fr-\" sound, blood, sang , is the missing link between Rosbifs and LeS ANGglais. British beefeaters ran the risk of being also meatheads, crude, unsophisticated and uncultured, bloody carnivores, savages, fat, red-faced, red-coated, bull-headed; in short, b tes . </p> <p>All this red-toothed savagery is clearly overcompensating for something. Indeed, the lyrics to O the Roast Beef of Old England are full of anxiety about the influence of French ragots , dangerously \u00e0 la mode , usurping the beef of Elizabethan times that had helped to sink the Armada. Other cartoons in the exhibition satirise the import of Parisian fashions. The French would first corrupt then conquer us. Indeed, the Calais Gate, emblazoned with the English coat of arms, was a monument to defeat and decline, our last possession on the mainland, lost for us by Bloody Catholic Mary. Hogarth and the Sublime Society of Beefsteaks thought they were fighting a rearguard action. </p> <p>The beef is the Gate of Calais, a better \"bulwark\" than mere stones. But behind all this is an even deeper anxiety, revealed by the Scottish theologian John Weemse in 1632. The Jewish doctrine that to eat more than a pound of flesh at a sitting was gluttony did not apply, he argued, \"in these cold countries\". </p> <p>There's the rub. For all their bloody beef the English were never a sanguine nation, but the exact opposite: cold, inert, phlegmatic and depressed. They tried their very hardest not to be, very possibly, despite the health risks, we are still trying today. But of all nations we remain the most amphibious, the sea-faring frogs of Europe, ever since we usurped the Dutch from that position. And we all know what Frenchmen do with those cold-blooded, clammy creatures - let's not balk at the obvious now - they bloody eat them. </p> <p>\u0095 Re-Presenting Britain: Roast Beef and Liberty is at Tate Britain, London SW1 (0171-887 8000), till September.</p>",

Disturbingly, you see, Xena the Warrior Princess died. She and her assistant Gabrielle were crucified by the Romans at the end of the last series and left dangling until the start of the new one, which must have been a trial. Might this spell the end for our dalliance with stout-thighed female fighters? Like, is the Xena demographic going to have to feign an interest in Hercules now?

Disturbingly, you see, Xena the Warrior Princess died. She and her assistant Gabrielle were crucified by the Romans at the end of the last series and left dangling until the start of the new one, which must have been a trial. Might this spell the end for our dalliance with stout-thighed female fighters? Like, is the Xena demographic going to have to feign an interest in Hercules now? Trust me, it'll never work. When their friend Joxer found the pair, they were frozen to death. Meanwhile, the souls of Xena and Gabrielle were ascending to heaven.

I was based in Northern Ireland at the time, and I used to drive around listening to Radio 1, reflecting how much more fun it would be to take my Chevy to the levee for a whiskey and rye than kangarooing round County Tyrone in an old Ford Escort. </p> <p>A few days before the civilians were mown down in Derry, I had written an article in the Guardian saying that the paratroopers were so rough that several less exalted army units had asked for them not to be sent as back-up in their areas, because their liberal use of force had undone weeks of tricky community relations building. The article caused quite a fuss at the time, though it died down five days later when the paras shot all those people. </p> <p>So I felt rather nostalgic a week ago as I took the Piccadilly line to St James's Square, London, where the new inquiry is taking preliminary statements. Two very pleasant young solicitors questioned me for nearly an hour and a half, the time filled largely by me saying that I couldn't remember anything from 1972, except, I added rather feebly, I was sure that I would have checked the article very carefully. This was not least because our deputy editor was John Cole, later to become the BBC's best-loved political editor, who hated sloppy reporting, and took a somewhat sceptical view of any item which might bring comfort to the Republican cause. </p> <p>It would be perhaps wrong for me to reveal the inquiry's material, even on such a tangential matter as my article, but I was fascinated to be given photocopies of the various telegrams and telexes that flew between Ulster and the Ministry of Defence in its wake. Reading most of them, you can hear the flapping noise as panicky civil servants cover their backs. One telegram reads: \"We are disappointed in Hoggart, who we believe is the fall guy in this incident [quite untrue]. We hope to recover him, notwithstanding that we hoped to recover Winchester [Simon Winchester, my boss at the time] but were disappointed.\" </p> <p>It's the \"recover\" word that gives it all away. That's the language of the cold war, or a John Le Carr\u00e9 novel. We were assumed to be on one side or the other, friend or enemy, double agents who had to be brought home. The notion that we just wanted to get at the truth may sound pompous now, but it was clearly quite alien to the military authorities then. </p> <p>\u0095 Travelling to the inquiry, I saw on the platform a very fat woman who was holding a little girl of about two years. The child wore a multicoloured pullover and had lots of dark curly hair. The woman was holding her with one arm and stretching out the other to beg. On the train they were joined by a thinner young woman who had a distinctive scar under her left eye. </p> <p>Two hours later I noticed the woman with the scar begging on the steps, but this time it was she who had the little girl as a prop. Presumably they swapped her round, rather like taxi drivers use a cab half the day before handing it on. </p> <p>I find it hard to be enraged by all this, though I think it must be a pretty crummy life for the children, who often look worryingly docile and doped. But there is a pattern in the arrival of immigrants. At first they are reviled and condemned, their lotus-eating lifestyle compared to that of British pensioners. Next, they open restaurants. (\"Yeah, I'm on the train, we're just going for a quick Romanian... Yeah, you know, Ionescu's, they do fantastic spiced turnips - it's next door to the Frog...\") Finally they make it and are the subject of cringingly admiring articles in the colour supplements: \"The top 10 Romanian-British millionaires owe it all to hard work and enterprise...\" </p> <p>\u0095 I also noticed on the tube a series of posters which made me admit an exception to my general rule that British advertising is not the best in the world but is usually rather embarrassing. These are ads for a Japanese beer, Asahi extra dry, and show a series of D-list celebrities in fanciful settings. They're in Japanese, as if designed for the Tokyo subway, but include the name of the celeb - essential, since few of us would know who they were - plus a short message in Japlish, that curious style of slogan you see on Japanese T-shirts. </p> <p>One shows a cheesy-looking individual in a tuxedo. \"Dickie Davies. Remarkable and finesse. So good,\" it reads. Another has a young woman with a riding crop, near what seems to be the stables of a country home, but looking a little like those people who turn up in the News of the World describing their encounters with footballers. (\"On the pitch he might have been a 10, but in bed he only rated 2.\") This says: \"Debbie McGee. Breeding. Extra-stately.\" There are so many layers of irony in these ads you'd need a blowtorch to strip them all away. But they made me buy a bottle of Asahi extra dry when I had lunch that day, so they must work on some level. </p> <p>\u0095 Sitting on a commuter train on Wednesday evening, looking forward excitedly to the education debate in the Commons next day with the Tory front-bencher Theresa May, I found myself sitting next to an attractive young woman who wore that durable, glossy make-up used by people who expect to be photographed a lot. She had on a knee-length beige leather coat, with matching trousers and snakeskin boots and spent part of the journey reading every word of the captions to the Daily Star pin-ups, something I have not seen anyone, male or female, ever do. Her phone rang and I realised from her chirpy conversation that this was the other Teresa May, the porn star, on her way to a shoot in otherwise dull, quotidian Twickenham. Apparently the two women are often confused, a fact which has served to raise both their profiles. </p> <p>Next day I put her name into a search engine and while her namesake was hammering on in the background about David Blunkett's failings, found some remarkable pictures. Had Teresa adopted these poses on the Kingston loop, an awful lot of people would have dropped their mobiles. And no, I didn't introduce myself. She must be pestered by dirty old men all the time, and we try to keep a low profile. </p> <p>\u0095 Baden Hickman, one of the nicest and most decent Guardian reporters I've ever met, has just died. When I knew him he was the religious affairs editor, and his stately manner and substantial embonpoint earned him the affectionate nickname \"Bath and Wells\". But he had a wonderfully sharp eye for the kind of offbeat story that the paper almost always printed at the bottom of page one, in a slot known as \"the basement\". The week Baden had church-based items printed there three days running we renamed it \"the crypt\".</p>",

Despite its tragic causes, migration has often had good consequences; by its means knowledge, skills, technologies, traditions and arts have spread around the world, and wherever people have found a refuge from their suffering in the welcome of a new home, they have enriched it with what they brought in their hearts and minds, those repositories of true treasure.",

He was apprenticed as a locksmith and joined the then illegal communist movement in 1943 during the German occupation. His working-class background and his involvement in the anti-Nazi resistance movement marked him out for promotion after the communists seized power in 1948. As a young man, he was a model apparatchik and rose quickly through the hierarchy of the CPCz's Union of Youth to become its leader in the early 1950s.</p> <p>To prepare for promotion, Lis moved on to the CPCz academy, the communists' finishing school, from where he graduated in 1957. But he gradually became disenchanted with the still largely Stalinist regime, and in 1961 was expelled from the party for sympathising with Tito's Yugoslav brand of self-managing socialism.</p> <p>As part of his punishment, Lis was denied the opportunity to work as a professional; he was restricted to manual work, earning a living by driving a bulldozer on building sites.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When the Soviet Union was in its death throes nine years ago, Vladimir Putin, a 39-year-old career KGB officer, faced an agonising choice in his native Leningrad. It was August 1991, when KGB hardliners, fed up with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of perestroika - reconstruction - moved to turn back the clock of history and mount a putsch. They took Gorbachev and held him hostage in the Crimea. Russia's President Boris Yeltsin called up Red Army tanks in Moscow to defy the plotters and defend democracy. </p> <p>This was the moment that would determine whether the Soviet Union would survive as a coercive superpower or whether Russia and a dozen other former Soviet republics would lurch towards democracy. The future of east-west conflict was at stake. The world held its breath; Putin hedged his bets. \"I was on leave,\" he reveals in a 180-page book of interviews about his life and times, First Person, just published in Moscow. Two days into the takeover attempt, Putin got back to Leningrad where he was still a KGB officer but also an aide to the democrat mayor, Anatoly Sobchak. </p> <p>Russia's second city was in uproar. The city's democrats reacted to the coup attempt by immediately setting up a defence headquarters at the Leningrad parliament. \"Putin never came near,\" says Alexander Vinnikov, a Leningrad MP who helped set up the HQ. \"His role was absolutely zero. He says now that was when he quit the KGB, but that's pure propaganda. Besides you can't quit. As we say, it costs a rouble to join the KGB and two roubles to leave.\" </p> <p>Sobchak died in February and so can't confirm Putin's version of events. The 47-year-old who is to be crowned ruler of the biggest country on earth in presidential elections tomorrow, becoming Russia's youngest leader since Stalin, says he ended his 16-year career in the KGB when it became clear that the plotters had failed. \"All the ideals and aims I had when I went to work for the KGB collapsed in the days of the putsch,\" he says in First Person. Nevertheless he sympathised with the hardliners' aims. He reveals that he later had good relations with Vladimir Kryuchkov, the hardline KGB chief who led the coup attempt, and that he tendered his resignation to his boss, \"a convinced communist who thought everything the plotters were doing was right. He was a very decent chap for whom I still have a lot of respect.\" </p> <p>The putschists' aim, says Putin, was \"noble,\" as they believed in preserving the Soviet Union from disintegration \"but the means and the methods they chose only hastened this\". It's a telling episode. Putin, the canny pragmatist, rather than standing on principle, waited to see which way the wind was blowing that August before deciding who to back. His decision to quit the KGB, he says, was \"probably the hardest of my life\". </p> <p>But he has never looked back since that momentous summer. Almost invisibly, but with a feline sureness of foot, he has stolen up the pole of power in Russia via the law faculty at what was then Leningrad university, the KGB, and the Kremlin bureaucracy, though there is nothing in his background or his declared ambitions to suggest that he would ever make it to the pinnacle. </p> <p>\"Putin's great talent is knowing how to please his bosses and getting noticed and trusted by them,\" says Dmitry Travnin, a St Petersburg analyst who has studied the city's politics since Putin was first aide and then deputy to Sobchak in 1991-96. \"He managed that with Sobchak and then with Yeltsin. He accomplishes it quietly by performing competently, efficiently, practically. He's the ultimate pragmatist.\" </p> <p>Putin is clear about whose side he was on when democracy and glasnost - openness - squared off against the KGB and secrecy. \"I was from the democrats' milieu. But it got worrying. Remember what kind of situation the security organs were in then. [The democrats] wanted to destroy, to break, to lacerate them, they called for the agency's lists to be opened up, for the secrets to be revealed,\" he complains. </p> <p>Putin spent five years as a KGB spy in Dresden, east Germany in the early 90s. He recounts how, when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, he helped destroy KGB files. \"I personally burned a huge quantity of material. We were burning so much stuff that the stove broke down.\" But if he is a proud product of the KGB, an organisation synonymous in the western mind with the terror and repression of the Soviet era, for most Russians this is an asset, not a liability. He is unabashedly milking the appeal implicit in the image of the KGB agent as the glamorous, shadowy hero of the Soviet state - Vladimir Putin as Russia's answer to James Bond. </p> <p>\"It's incredible,\" says a Moscow banker who served in the KGB for 32 years. \"Ten years ago you couldn't admit to having been in the KGB. It was shameful. Now you can boast about it. We're everyone's darlings. Putin's using that romanticism. He's also rehabilitating the service.\" In this he is being helped by his many supporters in the Russian media. In a hagiography of Putin days after he succeeded Yeltsin at the New Year, Vitaliy Tretyakov, the influential editor of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, wrote that the \"enlightened Chekist\" [the Cheka - the Bolshevik secret police - were the KGB's precursor] was just the kind of leader Russia needed. </p> <p>Tretyakov and several other prominent editors were summoned for a pep-talk with Putin a couple of weeks ago. \"He was open, friendly and confident, the ideal candidate,\" says the editor. \"In the KGB, Putin was a member of the Russian elite, though not known publicly. It turned out that these people were the best we've got. They knew everything, saw everything, and wanted to take the country forward.\" </p> <p>Putin's central promise is to stop Russia's rot and to restore the greatness of the Russian state. The country's elite thinks he can achieve greatness, or at least appears determined to thrust greatness upon him. He certainly was not born to it. </p> <p>Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born to hardship and suffering at the end of the Stalinist era in a city that bore the brunt of Stalin's spite. He was born - five months before the great dictator died - on October 7 1952 in Leningrad, the only child of Vladimir and Mariya Putin. His father was a war veteran, Communist party member, and foreman in a factory making subway trains. His mother had survived the 900-day Nazi siege of Leningrad, and did a variety of odd jobs as a laboratory cleaner, bakery worker, and janitor. His father died of heart disease last August just after Boris Yeltsin named Putin as his new prime minister. Mariya had died a year earlier of cancer. Putin's paternal grandfather was a cook to both Lenin and Stalin. </p> <p>His parents married at the age of 17. Asked whether it was a shotgun marriage, Putin replied, \"By all accounts, no. The main reason was love.\" They had two boys, born within a year of each other, in the late 30s. The first child died within a few months. The second caught diphtheria and died during the siege. Putin speaks of this in First Person, referring only to the \"child\" or his \"brother\", and mentioning no names. Mariya was 41 when she gave birth to Vladimir, known as Vovka as a child, and still called Volodya by his tight circle of friends. </p> <p>The second world war years in Leningrad spelled tragedy for virtually every family in the city of more than three million. From September 1941, the Nazis sealed off and starved the place for 900 days, reducing the inhabitants to cannibalism. In the worst weeks of the siege Leningraders were dying of hunger at the rate of 5,000 a day. The official death toll was put at more than 600,000. </p> <p>His father, who served in the Soviet submarine fleet, was assigned to the NKVD, forerunner of the KGB. He was relatively fortunate, operating as a saboteur behind German lines in Estonia, and so avoiding the siege. Some of his escapades read like adventures from a Boy's Own story. He was wounded, and left for dead, by a German who lobbed a grenade at him. According to Putin , his father escaped by submerging himself in a marshy pool and breathing through a hollow reed, one of only four of his 28-strong unit to survive. Shrapnel in his leg meant he limped for the rest of his life. </p> <p>Putin's mother, meanwhile, was starving in the siege, sustained by her brother, a navy officer. \"He fed her his rations,\" Putin recounts. \"Then the brother was ordered away somewhere and she was on the brink of death. That's no exaggeration. Mama passed out from hunger. They thought she was dead and they even put her with the deceased. She was lucky she came to just in time and groaned. It was a miracle she stayed alive.\" Despite such tales, he says his parents told him little else about the war years. </p> <p>Putin grew up with his family in one room in a communal flat in Leningrad shared with several other families. It had no bathroom and no hot water. He tells childhood tales of hunting rats in the stairwell. By his teens, his passion was judo, a sport at which he excelled, training every day and gaining a black belt. By 1976 he was the city judo champion. \"Sport is only sport if it's connected with sweat, blood, and hard work,\" he says. Karate, which he regards as a non contact sport, was for the richer kids. </p> <p>A residual chippiness stays with him. The KGB's foreign service was dominated by the smart and pampered offspring of the Soviet elite while the Soviet career system ran on \"blat\" - a sort of Russian old school tie network based on cronyism and connections. Roman Popov, a St Petersburg journalist with good KGB contacts close to the Putin camp, observes that Putin was a bit of an outsider without the connections needed to grease promotions and that his career owes less to pedigree than to deference, diligence, and loyalty, despite his father's wartime service in the NKVD. </p> <p>The banker and ex-KGB officer goes further, arguing that Putin's only known foreign spy posting, to Dresden from 1985-1990, proves he was not seen as a high-flyer. \"It's not Paris, Bonn, or Washington. Not even Berlin. Dresden was a second-rate posting. He's not really what we think of as an intelligence officer.\" Putin, by contrast, without revealing much about his activities in Dresden, repeatedly stresses that he was \"successful\" there and angrily refutes suggestions that he was a less than outstanding agent. He does admit that he returned almost two stone heavier, a weight gain he attributes largely to beer. </p> <p>His penchant for the martial arts suggests a temperament more geared to sport and physical activity than reflection or artistic pursuits, although he did woo his wife with trips to the theatre in Leningrad. He is a keen skier. He helped build the family country dacha outside St Petersburg, but it burned to the ground when the sauna caught fire. \"He's very intense but has trouble expressing his emotions,\" Sergey Roldugin, a St Petersburg cellist and close friend, told journalists. Roldugin said that he had once tried to teach Putin how to listen to music. </p> <p>Enraptured by the Soviet films of his childhood and stories romanticising the KGB agent as hero, the future president asked to join the KGB when he was 16 and still a schoolboy, around the time that Red Army tanks were crushing the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia in 1968. His history teacher then, Tamara Stelmakhova, now retired, says he was a star pupil. Though not the top of the class academically, Putin showed particular aptitude in leading classroom debates on the topics of the day. \"This was a very patriotic school. Volodya showed strong character, an acute sense of justice, and unusual responsibility.\" </p> <p>The KGB contact advised Putin to study law before they would consider him, and he was recruited in 1975 aged 22, after completing his degree. It was another 10 years before he went to east Germany as a fluent German speaker. His two daughters, Masha, 16, and Katya, 14, attended the German embassy school in Moscow until last October. His wife, Lyudmila, five years his junior, is from Kaliningrad, Russia's westernmost enclave, which used to be German east Prussia. </p> <p>She was an air hostess when they met on a blind date, at a Leningrad theatre, organised by a friend. Lyudmila was less than impressed: \"Volodya was standing on the steps of the box office,\" she recalled. \"He was dressed very modestly, I'd even say, poorly. He was so unattractive that I wouldn't have looked twice at him in the street.\" It took time for \"some inner strength\" as she describes it, to win her over. </p> <p>The Putins struggled to make ends meet, and thriftiness has stayed with them. Lyudmila recounts that they used their years in East Germany to put away a modest nest-egg, but were still broke when they returned to Leningrad in 1990: \"We spent all the savings on a car. But our German neighbours gave us their 20-year-old washing machine. We brought it home and it worked for another five years. We've never not had to count our pennies.\" </p> <p>Little is known about Putin's activities from when he joined the KGB until he went to Germany. There have been unconfirmed reports that he spied in West Germany during that period. When asked, he replied coyly: \"While working in the GDR [East Germany], I didn't go once to [West Germany].\" He did, however, visit Bonn with Sobchak in the 90s and met Helmut Kohl twice. He talks effusively about Kohl and the German leader's \"profound knowledge\" of Russian history, while naming Charles De Gaulle and Ludwig Erhard, the father of West Germany's postwar economic miracle, as his political heroes. </p> <p>Putin's five years in East Germany coincided almost exactly with the Russian revolution ushered in by Gorbachev, who became Soviet leader in March 1985. By the time Putin went home to Leningrad in 1990, the Gorbachev era was ending and the Soviet Union's days were numbered. Putin personally witnessed little of that thrilling time at home although he had a grandstand view of the collapse of communism on the Cold War's frontline. His recollections of the time evince little excitement at the coming of democracy to Russia or welcome for the liberation of eastern Europe from Russian and Communist control. The word \"democrat\" is hard to find among the 180 pages of First Person. The stronger impression is of pain and loss, of frustration, resentment, and bitterness at the Soviet Union's demise. </p> <p>Putin recounts a chat he had in German with Henry Kissinger, who said he could not understand why Gorbachev surrendered the Warsaw Pact and Soviet control of eastern Europe: \"Kissinger was right. We would have avoided lots of problems if we hadn't retreated so rashly.\" He has summed up his feelings with the sober realism that will be a hallmark of his presidency: \"You would need to be heartless not to regret the disintegration of the Soviet Union. You'd need to be brainless to want to restore it.\" </p> <p>In St Petersburg, Putin was put in charge of attracting foreign investment and organising barter deals for food imports as hunger ravaged the city in the early 90s. He rose to be deputy mayor and Sobchak's right hand man. \"The entire system of government for this city of five million had to be built from scratch in the early 90s. It's the system we still have and it was created by Sobchak and Putin,\" says Yury Novolodsky, a prominent St Petersburg lawyer who studied with Putin for four years and served with him in the St Petersburg government as justice minister. </p> <p>Putin then ran the campaign for Sobchak's re-election bid in 1996 and lost. He still nurses grudges from that chastening experience and is currently mobilising against Vladimir Yakovlev, the St Petersburg regional governor who won. From St Petersburg, Putin moved into Boris Yeltsin's Kremlin and advanced through various posts - administering the Kremlin's huge property empire abroad; being responsible for the Kremlin's relations with Russia's 89 regions; running the presidential national security council before, in 1998, returning to the KGB's Lubyanka headquarters to head its successor, the FSB. </p> <p>It was a political rather than a professional appointment. The FSB has had seven different heads in the past eight years. Putin was there little more than a year when Yeltsin made him prime minister last August and stunned all observers by also saying Putin should succeed him as president, a decision that will be confirmed at the polls tomorrow in Russia's third democratic presidential election. Putin, unknown a year ago and someone who has never contested a democratic election in his life, will be installed in the Kremlin for at least the next four years, possibly for the next decade or more. </p> <p>Roy Medvedev, the Russian historian of Stalin's terror, sees something strange going on. \"The emergence of a national leader in any country generally results from a complex and protracted political contest. Apart from during the revolutions of 1789 and 1917, there has never been such a rapid and publicly endorsed rise of a political leader like that occurring in Russia today.\" </p> <p>Boris Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev were public figures of world stature, bruisers with lifelong pedigrees in Soviet politics who rose or fell in pitiless power struggles which were also truly colossal clashes of ideas. Putin is pale and bloodless by comparison. Despite his deepening immersion in politics, he has never joined any post-Communist party, though he is backed by the Unity movement established last autumn as his instrument. A Communist party member for decades,he never quit the party as thousands did after the abortive putsch. He retained his membership card until Yeltsin outlawed the party in November 1992. </p> <p>But Novolodsky ascribes Putin's fitness to lead Russia to his KGB background. Since leaving university in 1975, Putin has spent 18 years of his 25-year career in the security services in one form or another. \"Objectively speaking, there's nobody better prepared to run Russia,\" says Novolodsky. \"There's nobody better informed in the country. He knows everything about everybody.\" </p> <p>Curious criteria, perhaps, for a head of state. But not in Russia. Putin's direct predecessors as prime minister, Sergey Stepashin and Yevgeny Primakov, were both KGB veterans, while Yury Andropov, a figure he venerates, was KGB chief for years under Brezhnev before becoming Soviet leader briefly in the 80s. Stepashin, also from St Petersburg, is sanguine. \"What are you guys in the West worried about?\" he laughs. \"Putin's a reliable, communicative comrade. He's an excellent chap.

      "bodyText": "When the Soviet Union was in its death throes nine years ago, Vladimir Putin, a 39-year-old career KGB officer, faced an agonising choice in his native Leningrad. It was August 1991, when KGB hardliners, fed up with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of perestroika - reconstruction - moved to turn back the clock of history and mount a putsch. They took Gorbachev and held him hostage in the Crimea. Russia's President Boris Yeltsin called up Red Army tanks in Moscow to defy the plotters and defend democracy. This was the moment that would determine whether the Soviet Union would survive as a coercive superpower or whether Russia and a dozen other former Soviet republics would lurch towards democracy. The future of east-west conflict was at stake. The world held its breath; Putin hedged his bets. \"I was on leave,\" he reveals in a 180-page book of interviews about his life and times, First Person, just published in Moscow. Two days into the takeover attempt, Putin got back to Leningrad where he was still a KGB officer but also an aide to the democrat mayor, Anatoly Sobchak. Russia's second city was in uproar. The city's democrats reacted to the coup attempt by immediately setting up a defence headquarters at the Leningrad parliament. \"Putin never came near,\" says Alexander Vinnikov, a Leningrad MP who helped set up the HQ. \"His role was absolutely zero. He says now that was when he quit the KGB, but that's pure propaganda. Besides you can't quit. As we say, it costs a rouble to join the KGB and two roubles to leave.\" Sobchak died in February and so can't confirm Putin's version of events. The 47-year-old who is to be crowned ruler of the biggest country on earth in presidential elections tomorrow, becoming Russia's youngest leader since Stalin, says he ended his 16-year career in the KGB when it became clear that the plotters had failed. \"All the ideals and aims I had when I went to work for the KGB collapsed in the days of the putsch,\" he says in First Person. Nevertheless he sympathised with the hardliners' aims. He reveals that he later had good relations with Vladimir Kryuchkov, the hardline KGB chief who led the coup attempt, and that he tendered his resignation to his boss, \"a convinced communist who thought everything the plotters were doing was right. He was a very decent chap for whom I still have a lot of respect.\" The putschists' aim, says Putin, was \"noble,\" as they believed in preserving the Soviet Union from disintegration \"but the means and the methods they chose only hastened this\". It's a telling episode. Putin, the canny pragmatist, rather than standing on principle, waited to see which way the wind was blowing that August before deciding who to back. His decision to quit the KGB, he says, was \"probably the hardest of my life\". But he has never looked back since that momentous summer. Almost invisibly, but with a feline sureness of foot, he has stolen up the pole of power in Russia via the law faculty at what was then Leningrad university, the KGB, and the Kremlin bureaucracy, though there is nothing in his background or his declared ambitions to suggest that he would ever make it to the pinnacle. \"Putin's great talent is knowing how to please his bosses and getting noticed and trusted by them,\" says Dmitry Travnin, a St Petersburg analyst who has studied the city's politics since Putin was first aide and then deputy to Sobchak in 1991-96. \"He managed that with Sobchak and then with Yeltsin. He accomplishes it quietly by performing competently, efficiently, practically. He's the ultimate pragmatist.\" Putin is clear about whose side he was on when democracy and glasnost - openness - squared off against the KGB and secrecy. \"I was from the democrats' milieu. But it got worrying. Remember what kind of situation the security organs were in then. [The democrats] wanted to destroy, to break, to lacerate them, they called for the agency's lists to be opened up, for the secrets to be revealed,\" he complains. Putin spent five years as a KGB spy in Dresden, east Germany in the early 90s. He recounts how, when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, he helped destroy KGB files. \"I personally burned a huge quantity of material. We were burning so much stuff that the stove broke down.\" But if he is a proud product of the KGB, an organisation synonymous in the western mind with the terror and repression of the Soviet era, for most Russians this is an asset, not a liability. He is unabashedly milking the appeal implicit in the image of the KGB agent as the glamorous, shadowy hero of the Soviet state - Vladimir Putin as Russia's answer to James Bond. \"It's incredible,\" says a Moscow banker who served in the KGB for 32 years. \"Ten years ago you couldn't admit to having been in the KGB. It was shameful. Now you can boast about it. We're everyone's darlings. Putin's using that romanticism. He's also rehabilitating the service.\" In this he is being helped by his many supporters in the Russian media. In a hagiography of Putin days after he succeeded Yeltsin at the New Year, Vitaliy Tretyakov, the influential editor of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, wrote that the \"enlightened Chekist\" [the Cheka - the Bolshevik secret police - were the KGB's precursor] was just the kind of leader Russia needed. Tretyakov and several other prominent editors were summoned for a pep-talk with Putin a couple of weeks ago. \"He was open, friendly and confident, the ideal candidate,\" says the editor. \"In the KGB, Putin was a member of the Russian elite, though not known publicly. It turned out that these people were the best we've got. They knew everything, saw everything, and wanted to take the country forward.\" Putin's central promise is to stop Russia's rot and to restore the greatness of the Russian state. The country's elite thinks he can achieve greatness, or at least appears determined to thrust greatness upon him. He certainly was not born to it. Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born to hardship and suffering at the end of the Stalinist era in a city that bore the brunt of Stalin's spite. He was born - five months before the great dictator died - on October 7 1952 in Leningrad, the only child of Vladimir and Mariya Putin. His father was a war veteran, Communist party member, and foreman in a factory making subway trains. His mother had survived the 900-day Nazi siege of Leningrad, and did a variety of odd jobs as a laboratory cleaner, bakery worker, and janitor. His father died of heart disease last August just after Boris Yeltsin named Putin as his new prime minister. Mariya had died a year earlier of cancer. Putin's paternal grandfather was a cook to both Lenin and Stalin. His parents married at the age of 17. Asked whether it was a shotgun marriage, Putin replied, \"By all accounts, no. The main reason was love.\" They had two boys, born within a year of each other, in the late 30s. The first child died within a few months. The second caught diphtheria and died during the siege. Putin speaks of this in First Person, referring only to the \"child\" or his \"brother\", and mentioning no names. Mariya was 41 when she gave birth to Vladimir, known as Vovka as a child, and still called Volodya by his tight circle of friends. The second world war years in Leningrad spelled tragedy for virtually every family in the city of more than three million. From September 1941, the Nazis sealed off and starved the place for 900 days, reducing the inhabitants to cannibalism. In the worst weeks of the siege Leningraders were dying of hunger at the rate of 5,000 a day. The official death toll was put at more than 600,000. His father, who served in the Soviet submarine fleet, was assigned to the NKVD, forerunner of the KGB. He was relatively fortunate, operating as a saboteur behind German lines in Estonia, and so avoiding the siege. Some of his escapades read like adventures from a Boy's Own story. He was wounded, and left for dead, by a German who lobbed a grenade at him. According to Putin , his father escaped by submerging himself in a marshy pool and breathing through a hollow reed, one of only four of his 28-strong unit to survive. Shrapnel in his leg meant he limped for the rest of his life. Putin's mother, meanwhile, was starving in the siege, sustained by her brother, a navy officer. \"He fed her his rations,\" Putin recounts. \"Then the brother was ordered away somewhere and she was on the brink of death. That's no exaggeration. Mama passed out from hunger. They thought she was dead and they even put her with the deceased. She was lucky she came to just in time and groaned. It was a miracle she stayed alive.\" Despite such tales, he says his parents told him little else about the war years. Putin grew up with his family in one room in a communal flat in Leningrad shared with several other families. It had no bathroom and no hot water. He tells childhood tales of hunting rats in the stairwell. By his teens, his passion was judo, a sport at which he excelled, training every day and gaining a black belt. By 1976 he was the city judo champion. \"Sport is only sport if it's connected with sweat, blood, and hard work,\" he says. Karate, which he regards as a non contact sport, was for the richer kids. A residual chippiness stays with him. The KGB's foreign service was dominated by the smart and pampered offspring of the Soviet elite while the Soviet career system ran on \"blat\" - a sort of Russian old school tie network based on cronyism and connections. Roman Popov, a St Petersburg journalist with good KGB contacts close to the Putin camp, observes that Putin was a bit of an outsider without the connections needed to grease promotions and that his career owes less to pedigree than to deference, diligence, and loyalty, despite his father's wartime service in the NKVD. The banker and ex-KGB officer goes further, arguing that Putin's only known foreign spy posting, to Dresden from 1985-1990, proves he was not seen as a high-flyer. \"It's not Paris, Bonn, or Washington. Not even Berlin. Dresden was a second-rate posting. He's not really what we think of as an intelligence officer.\" Putin, by contrast, without revealing much about his activities in Dresden, repeatedly stresses that he was \"successful\" there and angrily refutes suggestions that he was a less than outstanding agent. He does admit that he returned almost two stone heavier, a weight gain he attributes largely to beer. His penchant for the martial arts suggests a temperament more geared to sport and physical activity than reflection or artistic pursuits, although he did woo his wife with trips to the theatre in Leningrad. He is a keen skier. He helped build the family country dacha outside St Petersburg, but it burned to the ground when the sauna caught fire. \"He's very intense but has trouble expressing his emotions,\" Sergey Roldugin, a St Petersburg cellist and close friend, told journalists. Roldugin said that he had once tried to teach Putin how to listen to music. Enraptured by the Soviet films of his childhood and stories romanticising the KGB agent as hero, the future president asked to join the KGB when he was 16 and still a schoolboy, around the time that Red Army tanks were crushing the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia in 1968. His history teacher then, Tamara Stelmakhova, now retired, says he was a star pupil. Though not the top of the class academically, Putin showed particular aptitude in leading classroom debates on the topics of the day. \"This was a very patriotic school. Volodya showed strong character, an acute sense of justice, and unusual responsibility.\" The KGB contact advised Putin to study law before they would consider him, and he was recruited in 1975 aged 22, after completing his degree. It was another 10 years before he went to east Germany as a fluent German speaker. His two daughters, Masha, 16, and Katya, 14, attended the German embassy school in Moscow until last October. His wife, Lyudmila, five years his junior, is from Kaliningrad, Russia's westernmost enclave, which used to be German east Prussia. She was an air hostess when they met on a blind date, at a Leningrad theatre, organised by a friend. Lyudmila was less than impressed: \"Volodya was standing on the steps of the box office,\" she recalled. \"He was dressed very modestly, I'd even say, poorly. He was so unattractive that I wouldn't have looked twice at him in the street.\" It took time for \"some inner strength\" as she describes it, to win her over. The Putins struggled to make ends meet, and thriftiness has stayed with them. Lyudmila recounts that they used their years in East Germany to put away a modest nest-egg, but were still broke when they returned to Leningrad in 1990: \"We spent all the savings on a car. But our German neighbours gave us their 20-year-old washing machine. We brought it home and it worked for another five years. We've never not had to count our pennies.\" Little is known about Putin's activities from when he joined the KGB until he went to Germany. There have been unconfirmed reports that he spied in West Germany during that period. When asked, he replied coyly: \"While working in the GDR [East Germany], I didn't go once to [West Germany].\" He did, however, visit Bonn with Sobchak in the 90s and met Helmut Kohl twice. He talks effusively about Kohl and the German leader's \"profound knowledge\" of Russian history, while naming Charles De Gaulle and Ludwig Erhard, the father of West Germany's postwar economic miracle, as his political heroes. Putin's five years in East Germany coincided almost exactly with the Russian revolution ushered in by Gorbachev, who became Soviet leader in March 1985. By the time Putin went home to Leningrad in 1990, the Gorbachev era was ending and the Soviet Union's days were numbered. Putin personally witnessed little of that thrilling time at home although he had a grandstand view of the collapse of communism on the Cold War's frontline. His recollections of the time evince little excitement at the coming of democracy to Russia or welcome for the liberation of eastern Europe from Russian and Communist control. The word \"democrat\" is hard to find among the 180 pages of First Person. The stronger impression is of pain and loss, of frustration, resentment, and bitterness at the Soviet Union's demise. Putin recounts a chat he had in German with Henry Kissinger, who said he could not understand why Gorbachev surrendered the Warsaw Pact and Soviet control of eastern Europe: \"Kissinger was right. We would have avoided lots of problems if we hadn't retreated so rashly.\" He has summed up his feelings with the sober realism that will be a hallmark of his presidency: \"You would need to be heartless not to regret the disintegration of the Soviet Union. You'd need to be brainless to want to restore it.\" In St Petersburg, Putin was put in charge of attracting foreign investment and organising barter deals for food imports as hunger ravaged the city in the early 90s. He rose to be deputy mayor and Sobchak's right hand man. \"The entire system of government for this city of five million had to be built from scratch in the early 90s. It's the system we still have and it was created by Sobchak and Putin,\" says Yury Novolodsky, a prominent St Petersburg lawyer who studied with Putin for four years and served with him in the St Petersburg government as justice minister. Putin then ran the campaign for Sobchak's re-election bid in 1996 and lost. He still nurses grudges from that chastening experience and is currently mobilising against Vladimir Yakovlev, the St Petersburg regional governor who won. From St Petersburg, Putin moved into Boris Yeltsin's Kremlin and advanced through various posts - administering the Kremlin's huge property empire abroad; being responsible for the Kremlin's relations with Russia's 89 regions; running the presidential national security council before, in 1998, returning to the KGB's Lubyanka headquarters to head its successor, the FSB. It was a political rather than a professional appointment. The FSB has had seven different heads in the past eight years. Putin was there little more than a year when Yeltsin made him prime minister last August and stunned all observers by also saying Putin should succeed him as president, a decision that will be confirmed at the polls tomorrow in Russia's third democratic presidential election. Putin, unknown a year ago and someone who has never contested a democratic election in his life, will be installed in the Kremlin for at least the next four years, possibly for the next decade or more. Roy Medvedev, the Russian historian of Stalin's terror, sees something strange going on. \"The emergence of a national leader in any country generally results from a complex and protracted political contest. Apart from during the revolutions of 1789 and 1917, there has never been such a rapid and publicly endorsed rise of a political leader like that occurring in Russia today.\" Boris Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev were public figures of world stature, bruisers with lifelong pedigrees in Soviet politics who rose or fell in pitiless power struggles which were also truly colossal clashes of ideas. Putin is pale and bloodless by comparison. Despite his deepening immersion in politics, he has never joined any post-Communist party, though he is backed by the Unity movement established last autumn as his instrument. A Communist party member for decades,he never quit the party as thousands did after the abortive putsch. He retained his membership card until Yeltsin outlawed the party in November 1992. But Novolodsky ascribes Putin's fitness to lead Russia to his KGB background. Since leaving university in 1975, Putin has spent 18 years of his 25-year career in the security services in one form or another. \"Objectively speaking, there's nobody better prepared to run Russia,\" says Novolodsky. \"There's nobody better informed in the country. He knows everything about everybody.\" Curious criteria, perhaps, for a head of state. But not in Russia. Putin's direct predecessors as prime minister, Sergey Stepashin and Yevgeny Primakov, were both KGB veterans, while Yury Andropov, a figure he venerates, was KGB chief for years under Brezhnev before becoming Soviet leader briefly in the 80s. Stepashin, also from St Petersburg, is sanguine. \"What are you guys in the West worried about?\" he laughs. \"Putin's a reliable, communicative comrade. He's an excellent chap. He knows where he's going.\" But the question is how he intends to get there. Yeltsin's endorsement of Putin, plus the New Year transfer of power and the calling of early elections, have short-circuited Russia's young and feeble democracy. The jury is out on what Putin - who says he is a moderniser - means for that democracy. From Peter the Great to Lenin and Stalin, Russia's history is studded with great \"modernisers\" who were tyrants. Russia's rights and liberties are forever sacrificed on the altar of \"progress\" and \"modernisation.\" Putin talks tough, describing captured Chechen warlords as \"not so much terrorists as animals\". The Russian journalist, Andrei Babitsky, arrested in Chechnya by the Russians, is a \"traitor\" whose reports on the suffering in Chechnya were acts \"worse than firing a machine gun\". Putin's backers in state television destroyed his two main rivals, Yevgeny Primakov and Yury Luzhkov, so systematically last year in an ugly smear campaign that neither of them is running against him tomorrow. And this week the Putin TV propagandists have gone further, stoking blood-lust against the Chechens by showing, on primetime news, a 1996 video of a captured warlord slitting the throat of one prisoner and ordering another to kneel before him then shooting him in the head. Such ruthless manipulation of the national mood, in addition to his KGB credentials, sends shivers of apprehension down the spines of the liberals in Moscow, who are dusting down Lenin's collected works and citing the revolutionary leader's deathbed testament.

      "bodyText": "Rwanda's military strongman, General Paul Kagame, has been appointed interim president, making him the first Tutsi head of state since the 1959 Hutu revolution that led to the rise of ethnic extremism and genocide. The ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front will decide in the coming days whether to make Gen Kagame's appointment permanent following the resignation of the Hutu president, Pasteur Bizimungu, who complained he was sidelined. But while the RPF insists there is no ethnic element to the political crisis, it will have a hard time convincing Rwandans, the majority of whom are ethnic Hutus, that Mr Bizimungu's departure is not another step in the consolidation of power by a Tutsi elite. Gen Kagame has in effect been the country's ruler since he led forces which won the civil war in 1994 and ended the genocide of about 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. He accepted the position of vice-president, under Mr Bizimungu, in the post-genocide government of national reconciliation in an attempt to reassure the Hutu majority that the RPF was not reimposing a minority Tutsi regime. Mr Bizimungu joined the RPF around the time it launched its invasion of Rwanda in 1990, after his brother, a colonel, was murdered by the Hutu government. Although he was appointed president purely because of his ethnicity, he took his role as a bridge between bitterly divided communities seriously. It took on added importance as the army battled with a continuing Hutu extremist insurgency, and during the trials of Hutus accused of genocide which some saw as a form of ethnic persecution. But for all the RPF's efforts, it failed to attract leading moderate Hutus into the government. The wars in Zaire, and then the Democratic Republic of Congo, led to further ethnic polarisation. Mr Bizimungu never persuaded the bulk of Rwandans that he was anything but a front man. Divisions came to a head over the appointment of a new government at the weekend when a close ally lost his seat in the cabinet. When the new government was finally sworn in, Gen Kagame was the only minister not to swear allegiance to Mr Bizimungu as president. A day later, Mr Bizimungu accused Rwanda's parliament of ethnic partisanship in corruption probes which led to the resignation of several se nior Hutu politicians this year. The disgraced officials included the former prime minister, Pierre-Celestin Rwigema, who was accused of \"mishandling\" a $23m World Bank donation. Unusually, state radio and television ignored the president's speech. A prominent Tutsi opponent of the RPF also resigned. The former speaker of parliament, Joseph Sebarenzi, quit in January and fled the country after MPs accused him of dictatorial tendencies . Some saw the speaker's effective dismissal as part of a purge of those who challenge Gen Kagame's hegemony. Gen Kagame's allies were quick to hit back at Mr Bizimungu by saying he had resigned because he too faced a corruption investigation. Mr Bizimungu is said to be particularly bitter about this accusation.",

In 1905 Hans Wilsdorf, a 24-year-old Bavarian who learned watchmaking in Switzerland, set up a business in Hatton Garden to distribute watches.

The Rolex business moved to Switzerland in 1919, when Wilsdorf set up Montres Rolex in Geneva. Since then it has had just three managing directors - Wilsdorf himself, Andr\u00e9 Heiniger and, since 1992, his son Patrick. </p> <p>In 1926 Rolex developed the product for which it is best known, the Oyster wristwatch, widely seen as the first truly waterproof watch. This was combined in 1931 with another Rolex invention, the self-winding watch, to produce the Oyster Perpetual. Variants of the Oyster Perpetual still account for most of the business. Features have been added, such as the day and date. The Oyster Sea-Dweller, water resistant to 1,220m, includes a valve allowing helium and other gases to escape during decompression. </p> <p>Today's Oyster range goes from a mere \u00a31,400 for the basic version to just under \u00a347,000 for a diamond studded model. The company does, however, make less chunky watches in its Cellini range, named after Benvenuto Cellini, the Renaissance sculptor and goldsmith. </p> <p>Dating Rolex watches has always been a difficult task for collectors, who will pay thousands of pounds for a rare model.

He is also, famously, of Irish origin, and if one were to descend to ethnic stereotype one might suggest that he hadn't just kissed the Blarney stone but eloped with it.</p> <p>His writing isn't confined to criticism: novels, plays, poems, film scripts - there is hardly a literary form at which the Warton Professor of English Literature at Oxford has not tried his hand. The critic he most closely resembles is Samuel Johnson. Johnson's most famous work was his dictionary, and this book is undoubtedly Eagleton's contribution as a lexicographer. That he chooses one word, culture, and contributes a 130-page entry, bears witness to the centrality of the word to modern, well, culture. </p> <p>Eagleton's starting point is his great teacher Raymond Williams's Culture and Society and the underlying definitions provided by his Keywords. Williams's project was to trace culture as a concept from the late 18th century into the 20th, from Coleridge to Arnold to Leavis, and to demonstrate how it has been the key element in a particularly English critique of capitalism. Eagleton does not want to repudiate this tradition, but he wishes to consider how the word has developed since the 60s and particularly in the American academy. In so doing he goes back to the German Romantic tradition from which the major current meanings of the term originated. The book is thus both an updating and an internationalising of Williams's project. </p> <p>The great 18th-century philosophers Herder and Fichte argued that Germany should not be concerned with apeing the French notion of civilisation, which hid its national origins beneath a universalist rhetoric; instead it should develop its own, specifically German culture. Eagleton demonstrates brilliantly that this basic shift underlies all those movements that take specific ethnic origin or sexual orientation as the defining features of an identity. Eagleton is both an unabashed universalist and a determined upholder of the claims of high culture. The point, however, is that his universalism could only be worked out through a democratisation of society which would mean, among other things, that high culture was no longer socially exclusive. </p> <p>The book's great achievement is its insistence that universalism finds its truth in the body - not the masochistic body of much contemporary sexual theory, but in the mortal body that gives religion its power. Eagleton is at his most brilliant when he argues against the prevailing belief that death is a limit that all must acknowledge. </p> <p>The book's twin enemies are identity politics, which would seek to imprison culture within ever narrower self-definitions, and a postmodern celebration of difference which denies the necessity of either self or definition. For Eagleton the self must finally find its definition within a social order. Yet at exactly the moment that one expects him to begin a contemporary elaboration of Williams's vision of the democratic institutions of the working class, the book ends. </p> <p>At the ICA launch of the book, the Labour MP Denis MacShane declared Eagleton to be \"on message\" for New Labour in his determination to bury the 60s. The member for Rotherham has a point. Eagleton rightly castigates those disastrous developments of the 60s that have seen sexuality and ethnicity highjacked into a correctness which used only be the preserve of Leninism. But it is obvious that the working-class institutions to which Williams made appeal in the late 50s can no longer bear by themselves the values that will transform capitalism from a party for the few to a feast for the many.</p> <p>If there is hope, it still rests in the conjunction of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll that was the slogan of an era that believed economic emancipation was inseparable from libidinal and creative expenditure. Porn, crack and the Spice Girls certainly suggest that there are terrible reckonings to be made, but to abandon the 60s is, quite simply, to abandon all hope of genuine social transformation. </p> <p>In the final pages of the book Eagleton lists the problems that the world faces as \"war, famine, poverty, disease, debt, drugs, environmental pollution, the displacement of peoples\". For him these problems are not cultural, but arise from the economic contradictions of capitalism. But, in fact, not only are all these problems incomprehensible without cultural terms, even more importantly their solutions are absolutely dependent on forms of education and entertainment, information and communication. Eagleton has delivered a magisterial analysis of the impasses in which contemporary university ideas of culture are caught. Perhaps it was too much to ask him to deliver an analysis of cultural realities at the same time.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Jim Dodge might have been just another West Coast oddball if it hadn't started to rain while he was building a fence at his home in northern California. The holes he'd dug filled with water and he began to think he'd never get the job done. \"Suddenly,\" he recalls, \"an image of a little duck floating in a post-hole like a miniature pond floated into my mind.\" </p> <p>That duck became Fup, a mixed-up mallard who lent her name to a very odd little book. Fup (\"Fup duck. Ya get it?\") shares a ranch with the thoroughly disreputable Granddaddy Jake, who thinks he's immortal because of his daily intake of Ol' Death Whisper moonshine; Jake's grandson Tiny, a huge lad with a passion for building fences; and Lockjaw, a bad-to-the-bone wild pig. Theirs is a fantastic story, climaxing in a resurrection and an ascent into heaven, but - like all of Dodge's books - the tone is as down-to-earth as the grit beneath a farmer's fingernails. </p> <p>The novella took several years to write but was an instant hit when it appeared in 1983. Dodge's small-fry publisher reprinted it three times within a month, then sold on the rights for $100,000. \"I was astonished by the success,\" says Dodge, a man of simple needs who's never cared much for fame or fortune. \"I'm glad I was in my 30s or it would have been an overwhelming experience.\" </p> <p>Dodge was 39, a former \"airforce brat\" who had ended up in a commune with a bunch of fellow free spirits, working with their hands to repair environmental damage. He had studied forestry, fishing and poetry, then tried his hand at teaching, but lost his job at a Catholic girl's college after he was caught skinny-dipping with two novices. \"It was absolutely innocent,\" he says unconvincingly. He had also fitted in a few years as as a professional gambler. \"That sounds very romantic but it's tremendously tedious,\" he insists. </p> <p> Fup was not Dodge's first published work, just the first to bear his name. He'd written poetry - \"my first love and abiding passion\" - but anonymously. \"I was anti-copyright. I didn't think ideas could be owned.\" Then, when the writer was in his mid-30s, his muse did a runner. \"I just came to a dead end in poetry. I started to hear my own voice and I didn't like it.\" </p> <p>Four years after Fup, Dodge published Not Fade Away, a full-length novel about Floorboard George Gastin, a mechanic who makes a tidy living in 60s San Francisco stealing and wrecking cars for insurance scams, but finds himself unable to do the business on a '59 Caddy. The car was originally intended as a gift for the Big Bopper, the singer who died in the same plane crash as Buddy Holly; rather than total it, George decides to deliver it to the Bopper's grave. As he blunders across the States seeking the Bopper's final resting place, he takes on board a series of larger-than-life, Runyonesque characters. But his constant companion is a tub of 1,000 benzedrine pills, which do nothing for his navigational skills. </p> <p>George's befuddled love-hate affair with drugs has, Dodge says, been praised for its realism. One counsellor even uses the book as a therapy aid: \"He says it contains every rationalisation that drug addicts use.\" You wonder if Dodge has been there himself, but he says not. \"I came of age in the 60s, so drugs were around in the circles I ran in, but I was never an addict. And I'm not a drug mystic. I never found a psychedelic I liked; I guess my hardest drug was marijuana.\" He did try speed a few times, but \"I didn't like it. I actually took it as a journalist when I was against deadlines.\" </p> <p>In 1990 came Stone Junction, which Thomas Pynchon described as \"an outlaw epic for our own late era of corrupted romance and defective honour\". It follows the young Daniel Pierce as he learns woodcraft, forgery, disguise and all manner of illegal and mystical disciplines from the members of AMO, the Alliance of Magicians and Outlaws, a kind of anti-establishment, anti-rational counterculture. At the same time he is trying to discover who murdered his mother. Pynchon praised Dodge's \"choice never to dance away into wistful gobbledegook\" - no mean feat, given that his hero spends much of his time meditating and eventually learns how to think himself invisible. Daniel spends a lot of time in communes, out in the wilds or learning to gamble, but all Dodge will admit is that \"some of my life is in there\". </p> <p> Stone Junction was actually Dodge's first attempt at a novel, begun when the poetry dried up. He worked at it every night for a year till he'd produced a \"huge ungainly manuscript\", then spent almost a decade pounding into shape. \"It just about killed me,\" he says. </p> <p>Dodge still lives in the coastal hills of north California, on a ranch 15 miles from the nearest metalled road. \"I just like living in the hills. I like being away from neighbours. But if you don't seek the spotlight, that's considered aberrant behaviour in this country.\" And so he is regularly described as a recluse, despite spending part of the week mingling with the crowds at Humboldt university, where he runs the creative writing programme. </p> <p>Ten years after Stone Junction appeared, Dodge has another book on the go, and is writing poetry again. He won't say much about the new book except that it'll be a detective story. At least, that's the plan. His wife has known him for more than 30 years, and she doesn't expect anything that straightforward. \"Yeah,\" she tells him. \"Like you're going to write anything like a genre novel.\"</p>",

Dodge's small-fry publisher reprinted it three times within a month, then sold on the rights for $100,000. \"I was astonished by the success,\" says Dodge, a man of simple needs who's never cared much for fame or fortune. \"I'm glad I was in my 30s or it would have been an overwhelming experience.\" Dodge was 39, a former \"airforce brat\" who had ended up in a commune with a bunch of fellow free spirits, working with their hands to repair environmental damage. He had studied forestry, fishing and poetry, then tried his hand at teaching, but lost his job at a Catholic girl's college after he was caught skinny-dipping with two novices. \"It was absolutely innocent,\" he says unconvincingly. He had also fitted in a few years as as a professional gambler. \"That sounds very romantic but it's tremendously tedious,\" he insists. Fup was not Dodge's first published work, just the first to bear his name. He'd written poetry - \"my first love and abiding passion\" - but anonymously. \"I was anti-copyright. I didn't think ideas could be owned.\" Then, when the writer was in his mid-30s, his muse did a runner. \"I just came to a dead end in poetry. I started to hear my own voice and I didn't like it.\" Four years after Fup, Dodge published Not Fade Away, a full-length novel about Floorboard George Gastin, a mechanic who makes a tidy living in 60s San Francisco stealing and wrecking cars for insurance scams, but finds himself unable to do the business on a '59 Caddy. The car was originally intended as a gift for the Big Bopper, the singer who died in the same plane crash as Buddy Holly; rather than total it, George decides to deliver it to the Bopper's grave. As he blunders across the States seeking the Bopper's final resting place, he takes on board a series of larger-than-life, Runyonesque characters. But his constant companion is a tub of 1,000 benzedrine pills, which do nothing for his navigational skills. George's befuddled love-hate affair with drugs has, Dodge says, been praised for its realism. One counsellor even uses the book as a therapy aid: \"He says it contains every rationalisation that drug addicts use.\" You wonder if Dodge has been there himself, but he says not. \"I came of age in the 60s, so drugs were around in the circles I ran in, but I was never an addict. And I'm not a drug mystic. I never found a psychedelic I liked; I guess my hardest drug was marijuana.\" He did try speed a few times, but \"I didn't like it. I actually took it as a journalist when I was against deadlines.\" In 1990 came Stone Junction, which Thomas Pynchon described as \"an outlaw epic for our own late era of corrupted romance and defective honour\". It follows the young Daniel Pierce as he learns woodcraft, forgery, disguise and all manner of illegal and mystical disciplines from the members of AMO, the Alliance of Magicians and Outlaws, a kind of anti-establishment, anti-rational counterculture. At the same time he is trying to discover who murdered his mother. Pynchon praised Dodge's \"choice never to dance away into wistful gobbledegook\" - no mean feat, given that his hero spends much of his time meditating and eventually learns how to think himself invisible. Daniel spends a lot of time in communes, out in the wilds or learning to gamble, but all Dodge will admit is that \"some of my life is in there\". Stone Junction was actually Dodge's first attempt at a novel, begun when the poetry dried up. He worked at it every night for a year till he'd produced a \"huge ungainly manuscript\", then spent almost a decade pounding into shape. \"It just about killed me,\" he says. Dodge still lives in the coastal hills of north California, on a ranch 15 miles from the nearest metalled road. \"I just like living in the hills. I like being away from neighbours. But if you don't seek the spotlight, that's considered aberrant behaviour in this country.\" And so he is regularly described as a recluse, despite spending part of the week mingling with the crowds at Humboldt university, where he runs the creative writing programme. Ten years after Stone Junction appeared, Dodge has another book on the go, and is writing poetry again. He won't say much about the new book except that it'll be a detective story. At least, that's the plan. His wife has known him for more than 30 years, and she doesn't expect anything that straightforward. \"Yeah,\" she tells him. \"Like you're going to write anything like a genre novel.\"",

His trick for finding out whether people know what they are talking about justifies the mildly high price of the book alone. It is so neat that I have my reservations about reproducing it in this review, but here it is anyway. \"And my trick that I use is very easy. If you ask him intelligent questions - that is, penetrating, interested, honest, frank, direct questions on the subject, and no trick questions - then he quickly gets stuck.\"</p> <p>Another good one: \"There is no sense in calculating the probability or the chance that something happens after it happens.\" In other words, the question \"What were the odds against that happening?\" is meaningless, if it has happened. His asides - on the folly of astrologers, the Birch Society (\"it sounds just like the Communist Party\" - an audacious thing to say in 1963) - testify to the integrity and purity of his intellect. </p> <p>This is part of a series of relatively recent popular science books (Feynman's text is by far the most ancient - yet strangely prescient, or perhaps predictive, like all good science) being reprinted by Penguin in new formats and natty covers. Very natty covers indeed. But the remarkable thing about the new design is that the books are now small enough to fit into a jacket pocket. The Feynman you could fit into a Levi's pocket, if you rolled it up a bit. This is either a breakthrough in book marketing, or simply a return to the days before vulgar gargantuanism when every book has to be as big as your head and far less easy to carry around with you. </p> <p>We look forward to the time when the principle will be extended to fiction and classics. Until then, other books in this series you could particularly do with are John Allen Paulos's Innumeracy, Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct, John Gribbin's The Case of the Missing Neutrinos, and Richard Dawkins's The Blind Watchmaker.</p>",

His trick for finding out whether people know what they are talking about justifies the mildly high price of the book alone. It is so neat that I have my reservations about reproducing it in this review, but here it is anyway. \"And my trick that I use is very easy. If you ask him intelligent questions - that is, penetrating, interested, honest, frank, direct questions on the subject, and no trick questions - then he quickly gets stuck.\" Another good one: \"There is no sense in calculating the probability or the chance that something happens after it happens.\" In other words, the question \"What were the odds against that happening?\" is meaningless, if it has happened. His asides - on the folly of astrologers, the Birch Society (\"it sounds just like the Communist Party\" - an audacious thing to say in 1963) - testify to the integrity and purity of his intellect. This is part of a series of relatively recent popular science books (Feynman's text is by far the most ancient - yet strangely prescient, or perhaps predictive, like all good science) being reprinted by Penguin in new formats and natty covers. Very natty covers indeed. But the remarkable thing about the new design is that the books are now small enough to fit into a jacket pocket. The Feynman you could fit into a Levi's pocket, if you rolled it up a bit. This is either a breakthrough in book marketing, or simply a return to the days before vulgar gargantuanism when every book has to be as big as your head and far less easy to carry around with you. We look forward to the time when the principle will be extended to fiction and classics. Until then, other books in this series you could particularly do with are John Allen Paulos's Innumeracy, Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct, John Gribbin's The Case of the Missing Neutrinos, and Richard Dawkins's The Blind Watchmaker.",

All translations are, as usual, by Nabokov's son Dmitri, who has lavished time and unusual talent on his father's work over several decades. </p> <p>More than 700 densely printed pages on this subject may strike even the most sympathetic reader as overkill. Does anybody really want to read page after page of Nabokov's highly technical descriptions of various butterflies? Are these writings \"important\" to anyone, even lepidopterists? Is there any connection between Nabokov's passion for \"lepping\" and his fiction? I suspect \"no\" is the correct answer to all but the final question, which one must answer resoundingly in the affirmative. </p> <p>In his shrewd introduction Boyd teases out the connections between the writer and the lepidopterist. One comes to understand Vladimir Nabokov as novelist more completely and precisely by understanding that science gave this canny author \"a sense of reality that should not be confused with modern (or 'postmodern') epistemological nihilism.</p> <p>\"Dissecting and deciphering the genitalic structure of lycaenids, or counting scale rows on their wings, he realised that the further we inquire, the more we can discover, yet the more we find that we do not know, not because truth is an illusion or a matter of mere convention but because the world is infinitely detailed, complex, and deceptive, 'an infinite succession of steps, levels of perception, false bottoms'.\" </p> <p>Born into a wealthy and aristocratic Russian family just before the turn of the century, Nabokov caught his first butterfly at the age of seven, in 1906. His mother showed him how to pin the insect to a board. His father, too, had been a keen lepidopterist, so the child had obvious models before him.</p> <p>But his monomaniacal interest in the subject is nothing short of breathtaking: Nabokov moved back and forth between literature and lepidoptery for the rest of his life, at one point spending six years - the happiest of his life, he claimed - at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, where in 1942 he wrote and published the first of his four major papers, a study of the genus Neonympha. It was also during this period that he began working on \"Blues\", a variety of north American butterfly that became his speciality and inspired the trip to the American west that provided background material for his most famous novel, Lolita. </p> <p>Nabokov's important writings on butterflies are reproduced in this volume, but in blessedly reduced form, since nobody except a professional lepidopterist would care to troll such material. Wisely, the editors have blended other kinds of writing by Nabokov with the scientific prose, beginning with the luminous meditation on butterflies from the sixth chapter of Speak, Memory.</p> <p>These writings - poems, excerpts from his memoirs, letters, diary entries, criticism and fiction - cover the period from 1941 to 1947, when Nabokov was most ferociously involved in lepidoptery. His obsessiveness is wonderful to behold, as when he writes to Edmund Wilson about a lecture trip to Sweet Briar College in Virginia. \"The weather in Virginia was perfectly dreadful and except for a few Everes comyntas there was nothing on the wing.\" Everything, in the end, was butterflies. </p> <p>Until now, I had not realised the extent to which Nabokov's fiction depended on his attention to the natural world. There is, for example, an excerpt here from a story published in 1945 called \"Time and Ebb\". Somewhat self-critically, Nabokov wrote that \"we\" - meaning the people of the early 40s - \"lived in the era of Identification and Tabulation; saw the personalities of men and things in terms of names and nicknames and did not believe in the existence of anything that was nameless\". Coming from a trained lepidopterist, this is quietly shocking; one assumes that the work of \"Identification and Tabulation\" is the principal activity of the taxonomist. </p> <p>But Nabokov's interest in lepidoptery went beyond sorting out and naming butterflies. He was not a mere tabulator. Indeed, there is something exquisitely metaphysical, even mystical, about his approach to nature's plenitude and complexity. He sought to uncover the sense of design that underlies the details of the physical world, and he delighted in the great cosmic mystery, the game of hide and seek that God seems to play with human beings. </p> <p>There was, of course, a pedantic streak in Nabokov. From childhood on, as Boyd notes, \"he preferred the small type to the main text, the obscure to the obvious, the thrill of finding for himself what was not common knowledge\". His scientific writings of the 40s brim with minutiae, with countless obscure details lovingly searched out, sorted, underlined and displayed. A similar temperamental preference seems to underlie his massive commentary on Pushkin's Onegin, compiled in the 50s. It also informs novels such as Pale Fire - written in the form of a digressive literary commentary - and Ada, a late masterpiece in which the author's erudition and urge for complexity reach spellbinding heights. </p> <p> Nabokov's Butterflies also contains a detailed, intimate profile of Nabokov as lepidopterist written by Robert Michael Pyle, who followed close on the Russian author's heels on one of his famous \"lepping\" trips. He concludes that Nabokov knew what \"all butterfly folk knew: the rhapsodic thrall in which one may be held by butterflies and moths\". He notes that two of Nabokov's most vivid fictional creations - Konstantin Godunov-Cherdynstev in The Gift and Ada Veen in Ada - were \"butterfly folk\". </p> <p>The obsession with butterflies gathers a great deal of Nabokov into one powerful stream, encompassing work of otherwise incomprehensible variety. While few readers will want to study the scientific articles reprinted here, their presence in this striking miscellany operates in subtle ways to remind us that Nabokov (who referred to himself as VN), was also a student \"of that other VN, Visible Nature\". Nabokov offered, in his magnificent fiction, a complete taxonomy of the human spirit. He might not have been so meticulous and thorough were it not for the parallel interest in lepidoptery, so amply on view here.</p> <p>\u2022 Jay Parini is the author of five novels, including Benjamin's Crossing, and of biographies of John Steinbeck and Robert Frost.</p>",

De Botton embarks on a scandalously shallow and perverse reading of Schopenhauer, here presented as arguing that when you're ditched by your lover, you shouldn't take it personally. After all, the rejector was only unconsciously respecting humanity's essential drive, namely the will-to-life.</p> <p>But this is a fanciful, unconvincing argument: only if all romantic rejection can satisfactorily be accounted for in terms of the will-to-life can Schopenhauer possibly be consoling. Worse, even if we accepted that the will-to-life was at the root of all sexual rejection, reading Schopenhauer would not help. The moral de Botton draws is this: \"It is consoling, when love has let us down, to hear that happiness was never part of the plan.\" It is at least arguable that the opposite is the case - that this pseudo-philosophical appropriation of Schopenhauer only rubs salt into the wound. </p> <p>Thirdly, the contradictory. In the chapter on Socrates, de Botton concludes in favour of reason.

      "body": "<p><strong> Boss Cupid</strong><br>Thom Gunn <br>Faber, \u00a37.99, 115pp<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502371041,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Thom Gunn's poetry has always been celebratory. In the 50s, as an English poet of the Movement generation, his icons were leather-clad bikers, Elvis Presley, soldiers - the rough, tough men of action - and he famously wrote \"I praise the overdog, from Alexander / To those who would not play with Stephen Spender\", lines that are still a joy today. In the 1960s, Gunn moved to the US with his lover; what followed was a celebration of San Francisco, the boys, the bathhouses, the drugs, the city itself. </p> <p>It has been a wide-ranging celebration employing a generous breadth of forms, from imitations of 17th-century poets through syllabics and free verse. The epidemic of the 80s - the lives cut short, the gutting of a joyful extended family - is rendered in The Man With Night Sweats (1992), one of the outstanding volumes of the decade: elegaic, beautiful, rigorous and resolutely affirmative even in the face of grief. </p> <p>At Gunn's age, and with the epidemic barely tamed, the elegies have necessarily continued. His latest book opens with a poem for the American poet Robert Duncan, exquisitely precise (almost old-fashioned) in form and diction, ending with the famous image from Bede which Gunn has employed before, the swift flight of a swallow through a medieval feasting hall.</p> <p>Gunn can be an unequivocally modern poet, but he knows the value of established images, icons and forms; the way his conversational voice entwines itself with verse forms hundreds of years old testifies to a facility few poets possess. Gunn uses form less as a restraint than as a vehicle for proper care. </p> <p>Wordsworth declared that \"poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings; it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity\". Gunn does not seem to care much for \"the spontaneous overflow\" ( he has wittily glossed it as \"Wet dreams, wet dreams, in libraries congealing\"), but his poetry is indeed that of emotion recollected in tranquillity.</p> <p>In his radio interviews with James Campbell (now usefully published in book form), Gunn says \"Yes, I'm a cold poet, aren't I?\" In comparison with the terrible urgency of Hughes or Plath (\"the last person I want to be\"), Gunn renders his subjects in controlled stanzas and reflective, hard-staring phrases, and revivifies them in that way. You feel the pertinent emotion without having it forced upon you. </p> <p>Tranquil recollection, of course, is not always immediately possible. Two poems in the present volume are about Gunn's mother, and her suicide when he was a teenager. They have taken (the poet himself seems surprised by the fact) 48 years to write with sufficient distance. It is typical of Gunn's generosity of spirit that he immediately uses his experience of grief and recovery in relation to friends who have lost loved ones. Boss Cupid continues to find sources of celebration in the midst of grief - survival, recovery - even though these are, inevitably, tinged with guilt. In \"In the Post Office\" Gunn visits the dying lover of a dead friend to pick up a memento promised to him. He exhibits a </p> <p> Bitterness and anger to the last, </p> <p>Against the roles he saw me in, because </p> <p>He had to: of victor, as he thought I was, </p> <p>Of heir, as to the cherished property... </p> <p>And of survivor, as I am indeed, </p> <p>Recording so that I may later read </p> <p>Of what has happened, whether between sheets, </p> <p>Or in post offices, or on the streets. </p> <p>Gunn has always been a connoisseur of poise and pose - at his most erotic, he is a poetic sculptor of muscle and flesh - and has always considered the roles that he and others play. There are frequent acknowledgments here that age and the times have rendered him more often a watcher rather than a participant; he goes further in a postscript to a poem about \"my / dear, my ever-present dead\". </p> <p>In Boss Cupid a poetry founded on martial imagery (his first book was called Fighting Terms), which at times has considered rigorously the isolated self with an almost Nietzschean delight in individual strength, has found new vocabularies to treat the playoffs between the self (survivor, recorder) and the wider community.</p> <p>The Nietzschean strain is still there (a consideration of lust for the young leads him to parody Keats: \"Power / as beauty, beauty / power, that / is all my cock knew or /cared to know...\"), but there are, more often, metaphors of settlement, negotiation, community, even democracy. The tension is maintained, one undercutting the other; thus Gunn truly celebrates \"the sexual New Jerusalem\" of the 70s, while elegising it, as with this Aids memorial: </p> <p> Walker within this circle, pause. </p> <p>Although they all died of one cause, </p> <p>Remember how their lives were dense </p> <p>With fine compacted difference. </p> <p>A poem about two lovers celebrates their dreams of eternal togetherness even as it tacitly suggests where things might go wrong, and ends with the lines </p> <p> The lovers tangled in mid-phrase, </p> <p>As if obstructed tongues might say </p> <p>\"We are the same in different ways, </p> <p>We are different in the same way.\" </p> <p>Boss Cupid treats its various loves - and modes of love - with admirable breadth and generosity. Gunn moves so fluently between the general and the individual, the celebratory and the serious, the erotic and the mortal, without unbalancing; these poems complement each other exquisitely, though each can stand alone.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boss Cupid Thom Gunn Faber, \u00a37.99, 115pp Buy it at BOL Thom Gunn's poetry has always been celebratory. In the 50s, as an English poet of the Movement generation, his icons were leather-clad bikers, Elvis Presley, soldiers - the rough, tough men of action - and he famously wrote \"I praise the overdog, from Alexander / To those who would not play with Stephen Spender\", lines that are still a joy today. In the 1960s, Gunn moved to the US with his lover; what followed was a celebration of San Francisco, the boys, the bathhouses, the drugs, the city itself. It has been a wide-ranging celebration employing a generous breadth of forms, from imitations of 17th-century poets through syllabics and free verse. The epidemic of the 80s - the lives cut short, the gutting of a joyful extended family - is rendered in The Man With Night Sweats (1992), one of the outstanding volumes of the decade: elegaic, beautiful, rigorous and resolutely affirmative even in the face of grief. At Gunn's age, and with the epidemic barely tamed, the elegies have necessarily continued. His latest book opens with a poem for the American poet Robert Duncan, exquisitely precise (almost old-fashioned) in form and diction, ending with the famous image from Bede which Gunn has employed before, the swift flight of a swallow through a medieval feasting hall. Gunn can be an unequivocally modern poet, but he knows the value of established images, icons and forms; the way his conversational voice entwines itself with verse forms hundreds of years old testifies to a facility few poets possess. Gunn uses form less as a restraint than as a vehicle for proper care. Wordsworth declared that \"poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings; it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity\". Gunn does not seem to care much for \"the spontaneous overflow\" ( he has wittily glossed it as \"Wet dreams, wet dreams, in libraries congealing\"), but his poetry is indeed that of emotion recollected in tranquillity. In his radio interviews with James Campbell (now usefully published in book form), Gunn says \"Yes, I'm a cold poet, aren't I?\" In comparison with the terrible urgency of Hughes or Plath (\"the last person I want to be\"), Gunn renders his subjects in controlled stanzas and reflective, hard-staring phrases, and revivifies them in that way. You feel the pertinent emotion without having it forced upon you. Tranquil recollection, of course, is not always immediately possible. Two poems in the present volume are about Gunn's mother, and her suicide when he was a teenager. They have taken (the poet himself seems surprised by the fact) 48 years to write with sufficient distance. It is typical of Gunn's generosity of spirit that he immediately uses his experience of grief and recovery in relation to friends who have lost loved ones. Boss Cupid continues to find sources of celebration in the midst of grief - survival, recovery - even though these are, inevitably, tinged with guilt. In \"In the Post Office\" Gunn visits the dying lover of a dead friend to pick up a memento promised to him. He exhibits a Bitterness and anger to the last, Against the roles he saw me in, because He had to: of victor, as he thought I was, Of heir, as to the cherished property... And of survivor, as I am indeed, Recording so that I may later read Of what has happened, whether between sheets, Or in post offices, or on the streets. Gunn has always been a connoisseur of poise and pose - at his most erotic, he is a poetic sculptor of muscle and flesh - and has always considered the roles that he and others play. There are frequent acknowledgments here that age and the times have rendered him more often a watcher rather than a participant; he goes further in a postscript to a poem about \"my / dear, my ever-present dead\". In Boss Cupid a poetry founded on martial imagery (his first book was called Fighting Terms), which at times has considered rigorously the isolated self with an almost Nietzschean delight in individual strength, has found new vocabularies to treat the playoffs between the self (survivor, recorder) and the wider community. The Nietzschean strain is still there (a consideration of lust for the young leads him to parody Keats: \"Power / as beauty, beauty / power, that / is all my cock knew or /cared to know...\"), but there are, more often, metaphors of settlement, negotiation, community, even democracy. The tension is maintained, one undercutting the other; thus Gunn truly celebrates \"the sexual New Jerusalem\" of the 70s, while elegising it, as with this Aids memorial: Walker within this circle, pause. Although they all died of one cause, Remember how their lives were dense With fine compacted difference. A poem about two lovers celebrates their dreams of eternal togetherness even as it tacitly suggests where things might go wrong, and ends with the lines The lovers tangled in mid-phrase, As if obstructed tongues might say \"We are the same in different ways, We are different in the same way.\" Boss Cupid treats its various loves - and modes of love - with admirable breadth and generosity. Gunn moves so fluently between the general and the individual, the celebratory and the serious, the erotic and the mortal, without unbalancing; these poems complement each other exquisitely, though each can stand alone.",

He fears that personal information collected by one company and governed by its privacy policies could be used months later by the much larger organisation without further consent. \"It's one thing for a user to consent to the use of personal information by a relatively small company that has a fairly well defined mission and another for that information to be used by a large multi-purpose organisation,\" he said. eBay, the busiest online e-commerce site, with an average of 1.8m users a day in January, has built up a massive database of names and addresses of users. Yahoo! which is the world's most popular portal, attracts 45m unique users a month. Organisations such as Epic have argued that the system of self-regulation should be tightened on the back of increasing consolidation. The merger of America Online and Time Warner earlier this year has helped raise concerns about the rapid consolidation of the industry as well as setting off a wave of merger speculation. Analysts yesterday welcomed any indication that Yahoo! and eBay will merge. Several said that Yahoo! would be able to generate more revenue from attracting eBay's loyal customer base. However, one analyst questioned the price that Yahoo! which is valued at more than $100bn at yesterday's price, would have to pay for eBay. The wave of speculation, which started on reports that the on-off talks had ended last week, has helped give eBay a market value of $32bn.",

Lift the phone or use the internet to check a few deals from other banks. Switch banks if you want. It's not as difficult as it is made out, and it will get easier.\" </p> <p>Mr Cruickshank made more than 50 recommendations in his report, ranging from the creation of a new watchdog to oversee charges on cash machines to the need for better information on products so that people can see which are the best deals. In Tuesday's Budget the chancellor said he would be acting on these, promising \"a package of measures designed to reduce prices and improve services for consumers\". </p> <p>The stranglehold the \"big four\" banks - Barclays, Lloyds TSB, HSBC and NatWest - have over current accounts lies at the root of the problems Mr Cruickshank identified. Almost 70% of us have our current account with one of these four. </p> <p>One issue is that the major banks have control of all the major payment systems - everything from cash machines to cheque clearing - and that makes it difficult for new entrants to compete in areas that use these systems: in particular, current accounts. Things are changing, however: Smile, the Co-op Bank's online operation, offers a current account, and Egg, the best-known internet bank, will launch one later this year. </p> <p>Another problem is that relatively few of us ever get round to switching our current account to another institution, despite the fact that large numbers of us aren't satisfied with the service we get. The main reason is that moving your account is seen as a time-consuming headache. </p> <p>One of the most bothersome aspects of switching has always been that you have to contact individually all the companies that take money from your account via direct debit. Each one has to send you a new direct debit instruction which you must sign and return to the company. </p> <p>But most people are probably unaware that a new pilot scheme designed to make this all much easier was launched in the autumn. If you decide to switch your account to one of the eight institutions taking part in the scheme - Abbey National, Halifax, Royal Bank of Scotland, Co-operative Bank (which includes Smile), Nationwide, Woolwich, Ulster Bank and Virgin - they will do all the sorting out for you. </p> <p>If you wanted to switch from NatWest to Woolwich, say, Woolwich will ask NatWest for the details of your direct debits. All you need to do is give your consent for the direct debits to come from the new account rather than the old one. </p> <p>It will probably be at least a year before all banks are involved in the scheme. The aim is that you will be able to change banks pretty much at the press of a button. </p> <p>So why might you want to move your current account? Here are some reasons: </p> <p>\u0095 The rubbishy rates of interest most of us get. Standard current account-holders with Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest and HSBC get a paltry 0.1% on credit balances. But Smile, the new internet bank launched by the Co-operative Bank, pays 4.85% - almost 50 times as much. For someone with an average balance throughout the year of \u00a31,000 in their account, a rate of 0.1% would produce interest of about \u00a31 per annum compared with the \u00a348.55 which the Smile account would pay. </p> <p>\u0095 Exorbitant overdraft costs. One survey estimated that current account customers are paying almost \u00a3300m a year in unnecessary fees for the privilege of having an authorised overdraft. Of the 12m people with an authorised overdraft, almost 5m pay a monthly fee of typically \u00a35. This is on top of the often high rates of interest charged. </p> <p>Of the big four banks, only HSBC has no monthly charge - with Barclays, Lloyds TSB and NatWest the fee is \u00a35. Yet many of the former building societies, including Abbey National and Halifax, and most of the new banking entrants don't impose a fee. For those who go overdrawn regularly, monthly authorised overdraft charges can add up to a sizeable sum. A customer of Lloyds TSB who goes overdrawn by \u00a3200 for five days a month would pay \u00a365 a year in fees and interest. </p> <p>\u0095 Cash machine charges. Lloyds TSB and Abbey National are among the institutions which currently charge their customers a disloyalty fee of \u00a31.50 if they use machines belonging to other banks. Yet Mr Cruickshank estimates the actual transaction cost at 15p-30p. That means someone who uses such a machine once a week is paying at least \u00a31.20 over the odds - that's \u00a362.40 over a year. </p>",

The stranglehold the \"big four\" banks - Barclays, Lloyds TSB, HSBC and NatWest - have over current accounts lies at the root of the problems Mr Cruickshank identified. Almost 70% of us have our current account with one of these four. One issue is that the major banks have control of all the major payment systems - everything from cash machines to cheque clearing - and that makes it difficult for new entrants to compete in areas that use these systems: in particular, current accounts. Things are changing, however: Smile, the Co-op Bank's online operation, offers a current account, and Egg, the best-known internet bank, will launch one later this year. Another problem is that relatively few of us ever get round to switching our current account to another institution, despite the fact that large numbers of us aren't satisfied with the service we get. The main reason is that moving your account is seen as a time-consuming headache. One of the most bothersome aspects of switching has always been that you have to contact individually all the companies that take money from your account via direct debit. Each one has to send you a new direct debit instruction which you must sign and return to the company. But most people are probably unaware that a new pilot scheme designed to make this all much easier was launched in the autumn. If you decide to switch your account to one of the eight institutions taking part in the scheme - Abbey National, Halifax, Royal Bank of Scotland, Co-operative Bank (which includes Smile), Nationwide, Woolwich, Ulster Bank and Virgin - they will do all the sorting out for you. If you wanted to switch from NatWest to Woolwich, say, Woolwich will ask NatWest for the details of your direct debits. All you need to do is give your consent for the direct debits to come from the new account rather than the old one. It will probably be at least a year before all banks are involved in the scheme. The aim is that you will be able to change banks pretty much at the press of a button. So why might you want to move your current account? Here are some reasons: \u0095 The rubbishy rates of interest most of us get. Standard current account-holders with Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest and HSBC get a paltry 0.1% on credit balances. But Smile, the new internet bank launched by the Co-operative Bank, pays 4.85% - almost 50 times as much. For someone with an average balance throughout the year of \u00a31,000 in their account, a rate of 0.1% would produce interest of about \u00a31 per annum compared with the \u00a348.55 which the Smile account would pay. \u0095 Exorbitant overdraft costs. One survey estimated that current account customers are paying almost \u00a3300m a year in unnecessary fees for the privilege of having an authorised overdraft. Of the 12m people with an authorised overdraft, almost 5m pay a monthly fee of typically \u00a35. This is on top of the often high rates of interest charged. Of the big four banks, only HSBC has no monthly charge - with Barclays, Lloyds TSB and NatWest the fee is \u00a35. Yet many of the former building societies, including Abbey National and Halifax, and most of the new banking entrants don't impose a fee. For those who go overdrawn regularly, monthly authorised overdraft charges can add up to a sizeable sum. A customer of Lloyds TSB who goes overdrawn by \u00a3200 for five days a month would pay \u00a365 a year in fees and interest. \u0095 Cash machine charges. Lloyds TSB and Abbey National are among the institutions which currently charge their customers a disloyalty fee of \u00a31.50 if they use machines belonging to other banks. Yet Mr Cruickshank estimates the actual transaction cost at 15p-30p. That means someone who uses such a machine once a week is paying at least \u00a31.20 over the odds - that's \u00a362.40 over a year.",
