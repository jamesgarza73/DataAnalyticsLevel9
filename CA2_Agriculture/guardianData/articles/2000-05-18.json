      "body": "<p>Music has seen its fair share of bizarre double acts: remember the infamous Bing Crosby and David Bowie Christmas collaboration of the 70s? But rarely have the worlds of traditional and modern collided so spectacularly as the day Luke Vibert met BJ Cole. </p> <p>Vibert is a man of many guises. From the drum'n'bass twiddlings of Plug to the electronica of Wagon Christ, his has been a career in cool. Cole, on the other hand, has added the sound of his pedal steel guitar to the songs of everyone from the Verve to Kiri Te Kanawa. The pair's album, Stop the Panic, is less a set of songs than a collage of musical postcards, taking in countless influences from all around the world. </p> <p>As Vibert and Cole amble onto the stage, it's difficult to decide who looks the most uncomfortable. Without a word, it's straight into the music. Bongo beats slap against a heavy bassline while Cole slides away, his face scrunched up in concentration. Vibert and Cole barely look at each other throughout the gig, each lost in different musical landscapes. Drum'n'bass, jazz, hip hop and big band sounds all make an appearance here, with Vibert's humorous but dark undertones resonating throughout.

      "bodyText": "Music has seen its fair share of bizarre double acts: remember the infamous Bing Crosby and David Bowie Christmas collaboration of the 70s? But rarely have the worlds of traditional and modern collided so spectacularly as the day Luke Vibert met BJ Cole. Vibert is a man of many guises. From the drum'n'bass twiddlings of Plug to the electronica of Wagon Christ, his has been a career in cool. Cole, on the other hand, has added the sound of his pedal steel guitar to the songs of everyone from the Verve to Kiri Te Kanawa. The pair's album, Stop the Panic, is less a set of songs than a collage of musical postcards, taking in countless influences from all around the world. As Vibert and Cole amble onto the stage, it's difficult to decide who looks the most uncomfortable. Without a word, it's straight into the music. Bongo beats slap against a heavy bassline while Cole slides away, his face scrunched up in concentration. Vibert and Cole barely look at each other throughout the gig, each lost in different musical landscapes. Drum'n'bass, jazz, hip hop and big band sounds all make an appearance here, with Vibert's humorous but dark undertones resonating throughout. For Cole it's a case of keep up while you can; his delicate pluckings are often lost in the swampy epics. The guitar god comes into his own during the cheesier songs: Cheng Pooey is a vision of Oriental loveliness, while Dischordzilla is a screwed-up horror film theme with scary twangings. But it's in the Hawaiian-influenced tunes, notably Fly Hawaiian, that this collaboration works best. The slippery steel guitar adds character in the absence of vocals and gives some cohesion to what can be fun, but just as often becomes a mess of sounds, squeaks and cleverness. \u0095 Luke Vibert and BJ Cole play the Medicine Bar, Birmingham (0121-693 6001), tonight, then tour. ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible",

The fine by the securities and futures authority, which is in the process of merging with the new financial services authority, was accompanied by a severe reprimand and a \u00a3100,000 contribution to the regulator's costs. The fine affects the NatWest group, now owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, and the NatWest Capital Markets operation, where the problems occurred. As a result of the affair, uncovered by NatWest in February 1997 and ultimately the cause of NatWest's decision to sell off the bulk of its investment bank, the SFA said it had also fined two traders. The regulator said it would expel Kyriacos Papouis from its register of traders, in effect banning him from working in the City, and fine him \u00a350,000 as well as ordering him to make a \u00a32,500 contribution to costs. His manager, Neil Dodgson, was reprimanded, fined \u00a35,000 and required to pay \u00a32,500 towards SFA costs. The discovery of a \"black hole\" in the bank's trading books prompted NatWest Markets chief executive Martin Owen to quit and at least six people to leave. The regulator said yesterday it had concluded that the disciplinary proceedings arose out of the \"mismarking of interest rate options\" by the two men and deficiencies in the \"control environment\" at the bank. The SFA said that between January 1994 and February 1997 internal and external auditors told the bank's senior management of concerns about the manner in which NatWest monitored trading of the complex financial instruments. But, the regulator said, it had taken into account the fact that the bank and the two individuals had cooperated with the investigation, that NatWest was trying to improve its control structure at the time of the incident and the \"mismarking\" of the positions did not result in any third party losing money. The losses were uncovered by NatWest after Mr Papouis, who was 29 at the time of the incident, had left the bank. Mr Dodgson no longer works at the bank.",

      "bodyText": "British Telecom's efforts to woo its way back into City favour suffered another setback yesterday - despite a better than expected performance last year. Worries about the impact of intensifying competition at home and the costs of international expansion cast a cloud over the share price, which fell a further 7% yesterday - down 67p to 924p. Pre-tax profits last year fell by almost a third to \u00a32.94bn although the previous year's total was boosted by the surplus on the sale of BT's shares in MCI following the abortive merger. However, profits before exceptionals were down by a much more modest 5% at \u00a33.1bn - ahead of City expectations of around \u00a32.85bn. Announcing the results yesterday, the chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, described the past 12 months as \"an eventful, exciting and encouraging year\". The company would continue to see its margins squeezed in the core business in the UK but was well positioned in the key growth areas in the communications market, he said. His enthusiasm was not shared in the City. \"There's no doubt the UK side will get hard hit. They've got to persuade people that they have some potential to grow other businesses. At the moment it's not really clear to me that they have any particular advantages,\" said Paul Mount, an analyst at Nomura. On the plus side, BT's turnover rose by a fifth to \u00a321.9bn last year, but investment has pushed gearing close to the 100% level - a figure which finance director Robert Brace expects to be reached by the end of the current financial year. Spending includes \u00a34bn for a third-generation mobile phone licence - a sum BT has already handed over to the government - its purchase of Securicor's 40% of Cellnet and acquisition of the Irish telecoms group Esat. Although overall turnover was sharply higher, revenue from fixed-line services - domestic and international calls from BT lines - fell 2%. The impact of price cuts, including a 25% reduction in fixed-to-mobile call prices in response to the competition commission inquiry, more than offset a 7% rise in volumes. For shareholders the final dividend is being raised by 7.4% to 13.2p a share. BT refused to be drawn into the continuing argument about whether telecoms companies had been forced to overpay for the third-generation mobile phone licences - although Sir Peter noted that British licences would cost more than the total investment in the networks. Certainly that experience has not dented the company's appetite for new licences: it has bid or will bid for third-generation licences which are still on offer in the big European telecoms markets as well as in Japan. Some observers have been disappointed because BT has failed to clinch a blockbuster acquisition to rank alongside some of the deals seen elsewhere in the industry.

He's always looking for the chance to have a pop and should be well placed to nip in if the Chelsea defence is distracted by Dublin, Carbone and Merson.</p> <p>Trouble is, the injury he picked up in the Bolton semi-final is still bothering him - so keep your eyes on the team sheet. If it looks like he's starting, presume he's fit and have a go at 16-1 (Ladbrokes) or bigger if you can find it.</p> <p>If you prefer to trust your money with someone in a blue shirt, look no further than Dennis Wise. He looked extra-sharp against Derby last week. The universal 14-1 looks pretty fair from here.</p> <p>Whatever happens at Wembley on Saturday, it won't be pretty. John Gregory knows his best hopes of upsetting Chelsea is to charge at them full tilt. That way, he'll hope, they won't be able to hit their fluent, Continental stride. Drill Sergeant Gregory can then engineer a gritty victory which will draw comparisons to great British military victories of the past. A bit dull maybe, but potentially effective.</p> <p>Outside the stadium, Gregory styles himself as the last of the famous international playboys. If you saw On Side with John Inverdale you will no doubt have noticed the classic 'going-up-west' black jacket and Italian Riviera loafers. But his straightforward approach to Premiership touchline gear marks him down as grafter.

      "bodyText": "If Gianluca Vialli wants a Blue Day to match Chelsea's FA Cup win of 1997 he'll have to play it pretty cool during the build-up. First, his side will be expected to win - not least by the bookmakers - and high expectation could become a millstone if he lets it. Second, everyone from John Gregory to Ruud Gullit is reminding him of his under-achievement during a potentially massive season. \"Luca hasn't won anything,\" carped Gullit, all matey. \"Okay [Chelsea] reached the quarter-finals of the Champions Cup, but they haven't qualified for next season's competition.\" And finally, Vialli's squad are on the point of breaking up whereas Villa have the look of a side marching onward and upward. All of which points to victory for John Gregory's side - so where are the goals going to come from? If his hamstring was in prime condition, Ian Taylor would be the first player to make it onto your short list of top-value first scorers. He's always looking for the chance to have a pop and should be well placed to nip in if the Chelsea defence is distracted by Dublin, Carbone and Merson. Trouble is, the injury he picked up in the Bolton semi-final is still bothering him - so keep your eyes on the team sheet. If it looks like he's starting, presume he's fit and have a go at 16-1 (Ladbrokes) or bigger if you can find it. If you prefer to trust your money with someone in a blue shirt, look no further than Dennis Wise. He looked extra-sharp against Derby last week. The universal 14-1 looks pretty fair from here. Whatever happens at Wembley on Saturday, it won't be pretty. John Gregory knows his best hopes of upsetting Chelsea is to charge at them full tilt. That way, he'll hope, they won't be able to hit their fluent, Continental stride. Drill Sergeant Gregory can then engineer a gritty victory which will draw comparisons to great British military victories of the past. A bit dull maybe, but potentially effective. Outside the stadium, Gregory styles himself as the last of the famous international playboys. If you saw On Side with John Inverdale you will no doubt have noticed the classic 'going-up-west' black jacket and Italian Riviera loafers. But his straightforward approach to Premiership touchline gear marks him down as grafter. Trust him to get the job done, bearing in mind that Chelsea and Villa have produced one own goal over their two most recent league meetings. One nil to the Midlands side looks about right, Ian Taylor the scorer. It'll be their first FA Cup win since 1957. Recommended bet Correct score - Aston Villa 1 - 0 Chelsea First scorer - Ian Taylor 16-1 (Ladbrokes)",

Sadly, we've been warned off filing our report on how Eyebrows Geoff pulled off a very lucrative arms and drugs deal in Bow, so the news that West Ham have completed the permanent signing of Lyon striker Frederic Kanoute will have to do. Kanoute has cost the Hammers \u00a34m, but as they've sent kick-happy Marc-Vivien Foe the other way for \u00a36m, they've made a tidy profit of two (extremely) long ones.</p> <p>West Ham had been worried that cheeky footpads Chelsea's of Chelsea would swipe Kanoute from under their noses after the Frenchman's shop-window period at Upton Park started impressively. Kanoute had shown he could cope with the quality of Premiership football in the Hammers' match against, er, Wimbledon, and that was enough to convince Gianluca Vialli to offer Lyon \u00a34m for him. But Kanoute, who obviously understands what loyalty means in his new surroundings, has been as good as his word and pledged his future to the Hammers.</p> <p>\"I'm sure our supporters will be delighted we've signed Freddie and that he will be a valuable asset to the team,\" said no-cock-ups-as-of-yet Hammers official Paul Aldridge. \"At the same time we are sorry to lose Marc,\" he continued, grinning like a nutter, \"but it was always his intention to return to France and the deal represents good business for West Ham.\" True. But we don't expect Eyebrows Geoff to turn green at the news.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"With the Englishman [McManaman], Del Bosque has found the companion to Redondo in the heart of the side that had previously been occupied by mere stand-in tenants. McManaman has joined the axis and manages to magnetise all the play that Real Madrid want to control\" - Former Spanish international Michel makes a bid for Pseud's Corner.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>ABSOLUTELY FABULIST</strong></p> <p>Yesterday the Fiver may have given the impression that Lorenzo Amoruso - Glasgow O'Rangers captain and sometime mutterer of racist obscenities - had fallen out with his Ibrox paymasters. In fact, we may even have quoted an interview with Rangers News in which he said: \"There is just no respect in football. When they don't need you they kick you in the backside.\" But today we are forced to admit that Lorenzo never did say them things. If you take Lorenzo's word for it, that is.</p> <p>\"All I said was if I am leaving the club this summer then it will be because both the club and I have agreed to it,\" Lorenzo said, with absolutely no fingers crossed, earlier today. \"I didn't say anything about the club kicking me in the arse.\" Remembering sharpish that he was also the man who once claimed he had never called Victor Ikpeba a \"black bastard\", Lorenzo went on: \"I am a little bit stupid sometimes but I am not so stupid I would say these things to the club newspaper.\"</p> <p>Righty-ho then. So that would be why said club newspaper today issued a statement that read: \"The Rangers News has no intention of falling out with Lorenzo Amoruso, we have too much respect for him. He spoke for himself here and accordingly, we have listened to our tape of the interview.\" Now the Fiver is no Lou Grant, but it sounds like the News are sticking to their story. Which raises the terrible possibility of the lank-haired Italian being made to look a fool twice in one week. You see, while Lorenzo is busy arguing about his future at the club, the club are also busy - trying to sign his replacement - (yet another) Dutch international Bert Konterman. Talk about a kick in the arse.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez has denied reports he is set to join Manchester United. \"I have not received any offer from Manchester,\" Barthez told a news conference. \"I can tell you I will be at Monaco next season. I'm not trying to leave my club.\"</p> <p>Chilean international midfielder Clarence Acuna is apparently off to Tottenham.

      "bodyText": "FA APOLOGISES FOR RIOT FA chief executive David Davies has apologised for the rioting in Copenhagen - but claims it won't damage England's bid to host the World Cup in 2006. \"We apologise to the Danes for what happened in Copenhagen,\" he said today. \"But the decision on 2006 will be about which country has the best bid, the best infrastructure and the best grounds. Something like this is unhelpful but other countries who are bidding have security and crime problems, perhaps more so than us.\" The PFA chief Gordon Taylor has accused Uefa of failing to clamp down on Galatasaray's fans. \"You didn't need to be Einstein to work out what was going to happen this week,\" said Taylor. \"Galatasaray are a good side but as a club they have problems. There has been a regular trail of incidents involving that club and its supporters - and not just against English teams. When trouble brews with English supporters the punishments are strict but it doesn't seem to apply to the other countries.\" Meanwhile, the organisers of Euro 2000 have responded to the rioting in Copenhagen by insisting they are ready to handle any hooligan threat. \"We've been working on this for two years now. Every stadium is ready,\" said Euro 2000 spokesman Jan de Grave. \"We cannot guarantee a 100% safe tournament but we are confident we've had the right preparation.\" Uefa have also confirmed that they will not switch England's Euro 2000 clash with Germany from Charleroi to Brussels despite fears over safety. * * * * * * * * * * * * * IT'S SO EASY!

Sadly, we've been warned off filing our report on how Eyebrows Geoff pulled off a very lucrative arms and drugs deal in Bow, so the news that West Ham have completed the permanent signing of Lyon striker Frederic Kanoute will have to do. Kanoute has cost the Hammers \u00a34m, but as they've sent kick-happy Marc-Vivien Foe the other way for \u00a36m, they've made a tidy profit of two (extremely) long ones. West Ham had been worried that cheeky footpads Chelsea's of Chelsea would swipe Kanoute from under their noses after the Frenchman's shop-window period at Upton Park started impressively. Kanoute had shown he could cope with the quality of Premiership football in the Hammers' match against, er, Wimbledon, and that was enough to convince Gianluca Vialli to offer Lyon \u00a34m for him. But Kanoute, who obviously understands what loyalty means in his new surroundings, has been as good as his word and pledged his future to the Hammers. \"I'm sure our supporters will be delighted we've signed Freddie and that he will be a valuable asset to the team,\" said no-cock-ups-as-of-yet Hammers official Paul Aldridge. \"At the same time we are sorry to lose Marc,\" he continued, grinning like a nutter, \"but it was always his intention to return to France and the deal represents good business for West Ham.\" True. But we don't expect Eyebrows Geoff to turn green at the news. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"With the Englishman [McManaman], Del Bosque has found the companion to Redondo in the heart of the side that had previously been occupied by mere stand-in tenants. McManaman has joined the axis and manages to magnetise all the play that Real Madrid want to control\" - Former Spanish international Michel makes a bid for Pseud's Corner. * * * * * * * * * * * * * ABSOLUTELY FABULIST Yesterday the Fiver may have given the impression that Lorenzo Amoruso - Glasgow O'Rangers captain and sometime mutterer of racist obscenities - had fallen out with his Ibrox paymasters. In fact, we may even have quoted an interview with Rangers News in which he said: \"There is just no respect in football. When they don't need you they kick you in the backside.\" But today we are forced to admit that Lorenzo never did say them things. If you take Lorenzo's word for it, that is. \"All I said was if I am leaving the club this summer then it will be because both the club and I have agreed to it,\" Lorenzo said, with absolutely no fingers crossed, earlier today. \"I didn't say anything about the club kicking me in the arse.\" Remembering sharpish that he was also the man who once claimed he had never called Victor Ikpeba a \"black bastard\", Lorenzo went on: \"I am a little bit stupid sometimes but I am not so stupid I would say these things to the club newspaper.\" Righty-ho then. So that would be why said club newspaper today issued a statement that read: \"The Rangers News has no intention of falling out with Lorenzo Amoruso, we have too much respect for him. He spoke for himself here and accordingly, we have listened to our tape of the interview.\" Now the Fiver is no Lou Grant, but it sounds like the News are sticking to their story. Which raises the terrible possibility of the lank-haired Italian being made to look a fool twice in one week. You see, while Lorenzo is busy arguing about his future at the club, the club are also busy - trying to sign his replacement - (yet another) Dutch international Bert Konterman. Talk about a kick in the arse. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez has denied reports he is set to join Manchester United. \"I have not received any offer from Manchester,\" Barthez told a news conference. \"I can tell you I will be at Monaco next season. I'm not trying to leave my club.\" Chilean international midfielder Clarence Acuna is apparently off to Tottenham. Universidad de Chile president Rene Orozco admitted: \"We have reached an agreement with the English. He is sold to England over the last few days.\" Liverpool defender Rigobert Song has expressed an interest in joining Celtic after playing against them in Ronnie Moran's testimonial on Tuesday. \"I know they have not yet got a new manager,\" he said, \"but I hope that I impressed some of the people at Celtic.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Galatasaray manager Fatih Terim has revealed that he intends to step down as manager. \"It is over for me,\" he said. \"Enough is enough. We have won the Uefa Cup, let someone else win [Big Cup].\" David Dein has vowed to ban for life any Arsenal season ticket holders who are found guilty of violent conduct prior to the Uefa Cup final. Paul Gascoigne returned to action for the first time since breaking his arm as Middlesbrough lost 1-0 to Libya earlier today. Gascoigne, the most recognisable of the visiting players, was cheered by the 16,000 Tripoli crowd after every touch. Newcastle boss Bobby Robson has branded walkabout midfielder Silvio Maric a disgrace after he failed to turn up for the club's Caribbean tour. \"He's been unprofessional, disrespectful to the club and his team-mates and it's a disgraceful act. Whatever the maximum fine is, he will get it,\" said a furious Robson. Leeds United's plan to take a 9.9% stake in Oldham Athletic has been put on hold because the deal contravenes Football League regulations. The Scotland squad to face the Republic of Ireland at Lansdowne Road on May 30 is: Gould, Sullivan, Dailly, Elliott, Naysmith, O'Neil, Ritchie, Telfer, Burley, Cameron, Durrant, Ferguson, Holt, Johnston, Lambert, Burchill, Dodds, Gallacher, Hutchison, McCann.

      "body": "<p>Mr Chairman, policemen and policewomen, thank you for inviting me to address you. One message comes out loud and clear from your conference this week. You desperately want to be able to get on and do your job. You want to be free of red tape and political interference. You want to be free to fight crime and catch criminals.</p> <p>That is not the case now. As you, Mr chairman, put it yesterday, the police service are 'facing a crisis of no confidence, a crisis of no cash and a crisis of no colleagues'. You said that there is 'a sense of disorder and anarchy' in some urban areas and that many rural communities are 'unable to rely on the police'.</p> <p>You know, and I know, that this crisis is not your fault. Each day you go out on to the streets and do your job to the very best of your professional ability. And what a job it is. When I was preparing this speech, I looked at the list of officers who had won police bravery awards. In many cases, what is striking is how a routine incident like stopping a car or responding to a 999 call turned suddenly and without warning into an occasion where the officer has to put his or her life on the line.</p> <p>It is not just the acts of outstanding bravery that deserve our thanks. Day in, day out, you are the people who are first on the scene at a road accident, who deal with missing children and distraught mothers, who have to tell families that their loved ones are dead or seriously injured.</p> <p>That is why you command an 80 per cent public approval rating. With an approval rating like that you could be elected to run the Home Office. Come to think of it, that might not be a bad idea.</p> <p>Politicians of all parties have not always taken the right decisions about the police, and I am the first to acknowledge that your problems did not begin on 1st May 1997. But they have got quite a lot worse since then.</p> <p>Police numbers are falling, down by over 2,300 in three years. Police stations are being closed at the rate of 90 a year, leaving too many communities exposed and vulnerable. And the police service has become fair game to every pressure group competing to produce the latest sensational charge of corruption, abuse or discrimination.</p> <p>It is time we politicians remembered that your job is to fight crime and that our job is to help you.</p> <p>So let me start by utterly rejecting the defeatist nonsense that says crime is just a function of economic and social trends. For that is the constant excuse of a complacent establishment. They talk of crime as an abstract, dismiss victims as mere statistics on a page of a sociology thesis, and are always looking for someone other than criminals to blame for crime.</p> <p>This liberal thinking on crime, which has pervaded our criminal justice system for forty years, has comprehensively failed Britain. Over that period the murder rate has doubled, violent crime has risen from 24,000 cases a year to 664,000, and burglaries have gone up from 75,000 to nearly one million. The only period when crime fell consistently was at the end of the last government when Michael Howard was Home Secretary.</p> <p>I'm not claiming that everything was perfect in some long-forgotten age. We now know that sexual crimes against women and children used to be scandalously under-reported. We also know that rising crime figures are also a measure of increased detection and better policing methods.</p> <p>But we shall only turn the tide of rising disorder and lawlessness if we stop treating crime as an abstract problem and criminals as the victims of society. As every police officer who has ever had to confront an armed robber, or help a weeping victim of a mugging, knows - crime isn't an abstract problem. Crime is something people choose to do to other people.</p> <p>And criminals are not victims. It is the innocent people who they steal from and they beat up who are the real victims. Of course, there are incentives and influences, and the fight against crime is also a war on drugs, poverty and ignorance, on family breakdown and social dislocation. But criminals are not moral zombies sliding down a trend line on a graph. They make their choices and we should make them pay for those choices.</p> <p>Those English and Turkish thugs who caused the shameful display of violence in Copenhagen last night were not poor victims of society, they travelled to Denmark and booked hotel rooms with the specific purpose of committing crime. It is too soon for snap judgments but we need to see if the law is adequate and if it isn't we should look to see how it might be changed.</p> <p>I want criminals to be fearful of getting caught, and fearful of punishment, so they will choose not to commit crimes. I want to make convicted criminals unwilling to commit more crimes, or at least keep them under lock and key so they can't. I want the victims of crime to feel that they have had justice. I want the law-abiding millions in our country to feel free from fear in their homes and on the streets. I want a police force that gets the backing and resources from politicians it deserves. I also want a police force that is trusted across our society.</p> <p>You know that long before the Macpherson report ever existed, the police and the Federation have been reaching out to Britain's ethnic minority communities, building bridges of trust and working with local community leaders.</p> <p>I, like you, want to see many more black or Asian police officers, just as I want to see more black and Asian members of parliament - particularly Conservative members of parliament! I hope and expect that within my lifetime we will see a British black or British Asian chief constable or chairman of the Police federation or, indeed, Home Secretary.</p> <p>And because I know that so many of you share that hope and expectation too, I well understand your resentment at the charge of 'institutional racism'. No one, and I suspect least of all you, would deny that there are many things we need to improve in our police service, and many things we need to improve in society at large - but the slogan of 'institutional racism' has been lifted out of context from the Macpherson report and used by some to brand tens of thousands of decent, unprejudiced police officers as racists.</p> <p>That is a travesty of the truth. It is also wrong to allow a genuine concern about the treatment of ethnic minorities to lead to yet more unnecessary bureaucracy and regulation.</p> <p>You are already hamstrung from doing your job properly by form filling, and target setting, and endless paperwork. If all the officials in Whitehall had sat down and thought of the best way to tie our police in knots, then they couldn't have come up with a better system than the one inadvertently created in recent years.</p> <p>We need to set the police free to do your job. We need to give you the political support by defeating the liberal nonsense that says the war against crime can't be won. We need more police officers and less political correctness. In other words, we need more PCs and less PC.</p> <p>We know the war against crime can be won because of what's happened in parts of America. Anyone who says permanently rising crime is inevitable should visit New York. It used to be the murder capital of the United States; now it's among the safest large cities in the world. I admire what Mayor Giuliani, with the help of his police chief, has achieved in New York. I believe we have a lot to learn from them. In Britain we've heard endless talk of zero tolerance, but no one has really begun to try it - not yet.</p> <p>In this country, we have to set out with the confidence and ambition to win the war against crime; and we need to give you the tools and the manpower to go out and win it.</p> <p>We have to begin by increasing the number of police officers.</p> <p>You must be heartily sick of politicians coming here and calling for more bobbies on the beat, or more action against drugs, without promising you the extra police officers these things require.</p> <p>We don't make that mistake. We promise now that when we return to office we shall, as a minimum, restore the police cuts of the last three years.</p> <p>Of course, both numbers and quality depend critically on recruitment and retention. I understand your deep-felt concerns. What I can promise is that whatever was done before by the previous Government, we will come to the difficult issues of pay, allowances and conditions with a fresh and open mind.</p> <p>However, I must be candid with you. I simply cannot write you a blank cheque now in opposition. And if I did, you probably wouldn't believe me. But nor will I mislead you with promises which, when you look at the small print, turn out to deliver far less than you thought.</p> <p>We also need to get policemen and policewomen out from behind their desks and onto the streets fighting crime. I've seen some reports which suggest many police forces spend three-quarters of their time on administration and bureaucracy, and only a quarter on catching criminals.</p> <p>That is a crazy waste of talent and resources. We are going to have a bonfire of police red tape and regulation, setting you free to do the job you were trained to do.</p> <p>We are also going to make street patrols a priority. For the uniformed PC is still the building block of an effective police force. Street patrols may not be suitable for all areas, but they can dramatically reduce public fear of crime and trust in the local police by providing a very visible police presence in the community.</p> <p>Good policing is no good without an effective criminal justice system. For what is the point of devoting a huge amount of time and effort to catching a criminal one day, only for them to be released by the court with a flimsy penalty the next day?</p> <p>I regret to say that public confidence in our courts system is on the verge of collapse, and no wonder. Look at the examples we've had just in the last few days.</p> <p>There was the sixteen year old boy finally put behind bars after terrorising his local community for more than four years. In that time he attacked women, old people, he assaulted police officers, stole cars, damaged property, committed burglary and blackmail yet was repeatedly given both bail and a conditional discharge.</p> <p>Then there was the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that the taxpayer should shell out \u00a311,500 to compensate a convicted drug trafficker who argued that a police listening device had infringed his right to privacy.</p> <p>And, of course, there was Tony Martin. The details of the particular case are best left to the courts, but politicians and the police have a duty to understand why it generated such an explosive public reaction.</p> <p>The fact is that the law-abiding majority are fed up with a system that allowed the three burglars who broke into Mr Martin's home to collect 114 convictions between them without any of them serving more than a few months in prison and a couple of dozen hours community service.</p> <p>We believe its time to overhaul the law in this area so that we are on the side of the person defending their home and their family against the criminal, and not the other way around.</p> <p>Nothing dismays victims more or brings the entire criminal justice system into greater disrepute than the fact that criminals almost never serve the actual sentence handed down in court. It affects your job too. As the chief constable of the West Midlands said recently, 'until we see the full tariff of penalties being used by the courts on professional criminals, my officers will have to run faster than ever to stand still'.</p> <p>So the next Conservative government will introduce honesty in sentencing. We will abolish automatic early release on licence. We will make criminals serve the full term ordered by the judge in open court. Discounts from a sentence will only be earned by good behaviour in prison.</p> <p>I'm all for sensible efforts to rehabilitate offenders, but sometimes we deal with criminals who have spat in the face of the law, who have rejected every chance to go straight. A career in crime shouldn't be an option for these parasites on society. A lifetime in prison should.</p> <p>When we were last in office, my party introduced mandatory minimum sentences for serious sexual and violent offenders and for persistent burglars. We now propose tough minimum sentences for those who peddle hard drugs to children and for people convicted more than once of sexual offences against children.</p> <p>We will also stop the early release of serious criminals from prison. Last November the Home Secretary made an explicit pledge. He said that they had 'no plans or intention whatsoever to provide for \u0085 the early release of serious or sexual offenders. Let me make that clear, with a full stop - none whatever'.</p> <p>Yet he is releasing 2,600 convicted drug dealers, 2,300 thugs convicted of wounding, 1,700 burglars, 19 sex offenders, 22 people convicted of cruelty to children and 5 serving sentences for attempted murder.</p> <p>Of even greater concern is the fact that over 600 criminals released early have broken their curfew and 200 have committed crimes, including 31 assaults, 67 burglaries and 2 rapes.</p> <p>Either Jack Straw is the only person in Britain who regards none of these convictions as of a serious or sexual nature, or his promise not to release them early full stop was, like his promise of 5,000 extra police, worth nothing.</p> <p>Now the Home Secretary is planning to keep criminals in prison during the day and release them at night. Great thinking. This means they can't work, but they can burgle homes and mug people at night. I say instead of prison from 9 to 5, criminals should be locked up from 12 to 12, day and night.</p> <p>Some of the fiercest public criticism of the criminal justice system arises from the manifest failure to enforce probation orders and other non-custodial punishments effectively. When a criminal learns that he can defy the courts and that nothing much will happen to him, he is more likely to commit crime again.</p> <p>So if we are to start winning the war against crime then we have to enforce the sentence of the court. Here's what we are going to do:</p> <p>First, if someone on probation breaches their probation order just once then the court will be informed and it will have to take action.</p> <p>Second, the same principle applies to the conditional discharge. What's the point of a conditional discharge if the conditions aren't enforced? We will make sure that a breach of conditional discharge leads automatically to sentencing for the original offence.</p> <p>Third, we will take persistent young offenders off the streets. That means more secure training centres. And we will make young criminals sent to these centres subject to a new flexible detention order that links their release date to specific achievements tailored to each inmate. It might be a recognised qualification or even the basics like learning to read and write. Inmates would serve at least six months and the exact time of release would depend on the progress they had made.</p> <p>This proposal will punish, deter and rehabilitate younger offenders and protect the public from their crimes.</p> <p>And there is one further change to sentencing which I want to propose today. Back in 1988, we introduced for the first time in English legal history the right to appeal against an over-lenient sentence. At the time, many denounced this as a dangerous innovation. That is liberal establishment speak for straight-forward common sense.</p> <p>But the right of appeal applies only to a limited list of the most serious offences. Many crimes which spark real anger and fear amongst the public- GBH, ABH, burglary, racially aggravated offences - carry no such right to appeal. So we will extend the right to appeal against an over-lenient sentence to all so-called 'either-way' offences tried at the crown court.</p> <p>And we should apply the same, common sense approach to the out-moded rule that no-one may be tried twice for the same offence.</p> <p>By allowing a retrial in cases of jury or witness nobbling, we have already accepted that the double jeopardy rule is not sacrosanct. We should now go further.</p> <p>We believe that where new and compelling evidence of guilt comes to light - evidence which could not reasonably have been uncovered during the original investigation - the prosecution should be able to ask the court of appeal to order a second trial. It is just as much a miscarriage of justice when a guilty man escapes justice as when an innocent man goes to jail.</p> <p>Honest sentences. Enforcing probation orders and conditional discharges. Ending early release for serious crimes. Extending secure training centres and the right of appeal against lenient sentences. Reforming the double jeopardy rule. Putting victims first.</p> <p>These are Conservative policies which will go a long way to restoring public confidence in our criminal justice system. They go hand in hand with our commitment to a larger, better supported, more motivated police force that is free to do its job.</p> <p>For we can't win that war without your help. I commit the Conservative party here today to ensuring that you have all the political backing you need to be the strongest, most professional and best respected police force in the world.

      "bodyText": "Mr Chairman, policemen and policewomen, thank you for inviting me to address you. One message comes out loud and clear from your conference this week. You desperately want to be able to get on and do your job. You want to be free of red tape and political interference. You want to be free to fight crime and catch criminals. That is not the case now. As you, Mr chairman, put it yesterday, the police service are 'facing a crisis of no confidence, a crisis of no cash and a crisis of no colleagues'. You said that there is 'a sense of disorder and anarchy' in some urban areas and that many rural communities are 'unable to rely on the police'. You know, and I know, that this crisis is not your fault. Each day you go out on to the streets and do your job to the very best of your professional ability. And what a job it is. When I was preparing this speech, I looked at the list of officers who had won police bravery awards. In many cases, what is striking is how a routine incident like stopping a car or responding to a 999 call turned suddenly and without warning into an occasion where the officer has to put his or her life on the line. It is not just the acts of outstanding bravery that deserve our thanks. Day in, day out, you are the people who are first on the scene at a road accident, who deal with missing children and distraught mothers, who have to tell families that their loved ones are dead or seriously injured. That is why you command an 80 per cent public approval rating. With an approval rating like that you could be elected to run the Home Office. Come to think of it, that might not be a bad idea. Politicians of all parties have not always taken the right decisions about the police, and I am the first to acknowledge that your problems did not begin on 1st May 1997. But they have got quite a lot worse since then. Police numbers are falling, down by over 2,300 in three years. Police stations are being closed at the rate of 90 a year, leaving too many communities exposed and vulnerable. And the police service has become fair game to every pressure group competing to produce the latest sensational charge of corruption, abuse or discrimination. It is time we politicians remembered that your job is to fight crime and that our job is to help you. So let me start by utterly rejecting the defeatist nonsense that says crime is just a function of economic and social trends. For that is the constant excuse of a complacent establishment. They talk of crime as an abstract, dismiss victims as mere statistics on a page of a sociology thesis, and are always looking for someone other than criminals to blame for crime. This liberal thinking on crime, which has pervaded our criminal justice system for forty years, has comprehensively failed Britain. Over that period the murder rate has doubled, violent crime has risen from 24,000 cases a year to 664,000, and burglaries have gone up from 75,000 to nearly one million. The only period when crime fell consistently was at the end of the last government when Michael Howard was Home Secretary. I'm not claiming that everything was perfect in some long-forgotten age. We now know that sexual crimes against women and children used to be scandalously under-reported. We also know that rising crime figures are also a measure of increased detection and better policing methods. But we shall only turn the tide of rising disorder and lawlessness if we stop treating crime as an abstract problem and criminals as the victims of society. As every police officer who has ever had to confront an armed robber, or help a weeping victim of a mugging, knows - crime isn't an abstract problem. Crime is something people choose to do to other people. And criminals are not victims. It is the innocent people who they steal from and they beat up who are the real victims. Of course, there are incentives and influences, and the fight against crime is also a war on drugs, poverty and ignorance, on family breakdown and social dislocation. But criminals are not moral zombies sliding down a trend line on a graph. They make their choices and we should make them pay for those choices. Those English and Turkish thugs who caused the shameful display of violence in Copenhagen last night were not poor victims of society, they travelled to Denmark and booked hotel rooms with the specific purpose of committing crime. It is too soon for snap judgments but we need to see if the law is adequate and if it isn't we should look to see how it might be changed. I want criminals to be fearful of getting caught, and fearful of punishment, so they will choose not to commit crimes. I want to make convicted criminals unwilling to commit more crimes, or at least keep them under lock and key so they can't. I want the victims of crime to feel that they have had justice. I want the law-abiding millions in our country to feel free from fear in their homes and on the streets. I want a police force that gets the backing and resources from politicians it deserves. I also want a police force that is trusted across our society. You know that long before the Macpherson report ever existed, the police and the Federation have been reaching out to Britain's ethnic minority communities, building bridges of trust and working with local community leaders. I, like you, want to see many more black or Asian police officers, just as I want to see more black and Asian members of parliament - particularly Conservative members of parliament! I hope and expect that within my lifetime we will see a British black or British Asian chief constable or chairman of the Police federation or, indeed, Home Secretary. And because I know that so many of you share that hope and expectation too, I well understand your resentment at the charge of 'institutional racism'. No one, and I suspect least of all you, would deny that there are many things we need to improve in our police service, and many things we need to improve in society at large - but the slogan of 'institutional racism' has been lifted out of context from the Macpherson report and used by some to brand tens of thousands of decent, unprejudiced police officers as racists. That is a travesty of the truth. It is also wrong to allow a genuine concern about the treatment of ethnic minorities to lead to yet more unnecessary bureaucracy and regulation. You are already hamstrung from doing your job properly by form filling, and target setting, and endless paperwork. If all the officials in Whitehall had sat down and thought of the best way to tie our police in knots, then they couldn't have come up with a better system than the one inadvertently created in recent years. We need to set the police free to do your job. We need to give you the political support by defeating the liberal nonsense that says the war against crime can't be won. We need more police officers and less political correctness. In other words, we need more PCs and less PC. We know the war against crime can be won because of what's happened in parts of America. Anyone who says permanently rising crime is inevitable should visit New York. It used to be the murder capital of the United States; now it's among the safest large cities in the world. I admire what Mayor Giuliani, with the help of his police chief, has achieved in New York. I believe we have a lot to learn from them. In Britain we've heard endless talk of zero tolerance, but no one has really begun to try it - not yet. In this country, we have to set out with the confidence and ambition to win the war against crime; and we need to give you the tools and the manpower to go out and win it. We have to begin by increasing the number of police officers. You must be heartily sick of politicians coming here and calling for more bobbies on the beat, or more action against drugs, without promising you the extra police officers these things require. We don't make that mistake. We promise now that when we return to office we shall, as a minimum, restore the police cuts of the last three years. Of course, both numbers and quality depend critically on recruitment and retention. I understand your deep-felt concerns. What I can promise is that whatever was done before by the previous Government, we will come to the difficult issues of pay, allowances and conditions with a fresh and open mind. However, I must be candid with you. I simply cannot write you a blank cheque now in opposition. And if I did, you probably wouldn't believe me. But nor will I mislead you with promises which, when you look at the small print, turn out to deliver far less than you thought. We also need to get policemen and policewomen out from behind their desks and onto the streets fighting crime. I've seen some reports which suggest many police forces spend three-quarters of their time on administration and bureaucracy, and only a quarter on catching criminals. That is a crazy waste of talent and resources. We are going to have a bonfire of police red tape and regulation, setting you free to do the job you were trained to do. We are also going to make street patrols a priority. For the uniformed PC is still the building block of an effective police force. Street patrols may not be suitable for all areas, but they can dramatically reduce public fear of crime and trust in the local police by providing a very visible police presence in the community. Good policing is no good without an effective criminal justice system. For what is the point of devoting a huge amount of time and effort to catching a criminal one day, only for them to be released by the court with a flimsy penalty the next day? I regret to say that public confidence in our courts system is on the verge of collapse, and no wonder. Look at the examples we've had just in the last few days. There was the sixteen year old boy finally put behind bars after terrorising his local community for more than four years. In that time he attacked women, old people, he assaulted police officers, stole cars, damaged property, committed burglary and blackmail yet was repeatedly given both bail and a conditional discharge. Then there was the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that the taxpayer should shell out \u00a311,500 to compensate a convicted drug trafficker who argued that a police listening device had infringed his right to privacy. And, of course, there was Tony Martin. The details of the particular case are best left to the courts, but politicians and the police have a duty to understand why it generated such an explosive public reaction. The fact is that the law-abiding majority are fed up with a system that allowed the three burglars who broke into Mr Martin's home to collect 114 convictions between them without any of them serving more than a few months in prison and a couple of dozen hours community service. We believe its time to overhaul the law in this area so that we are on the side of the person defending their home and their family against the criminal, and not the other way around. Nothing dismays victims more or brings the entire criminal justice system into greater disrepute than the fact that criminals almost never serve the actual sentence handed down in court. It affects your job too. As the chief constable of the West Midlands said recently, 'until we see the full tariff of penalties being used by the courts on professional criminals, my officers will have to run faster than ever to stand still'. So the next Conservative government will introduce honesty in sentencing. We will abolish automatic early release on licence. We will make criminals serve the full term ordered by the judge in open court. Discounts from a sentence will only be earned by good behaviour in prison. I'm all for sensible efforts to rehabilitate offenders, but sometimes we deal with criminals who have spat in the face of the law, who have rejected every chance to go straight. A career in crime shouldn't be an option for these parasites on society. A lifetime in prison should. When we were last in office, my party introduced mandatory minimum sentences for serious sexual and violent offenders and for persistent burglars. We now propose tough minimum sentences for those who peddle hard drugs to children and for people convicted more than once of sexual offences against children. We will also stop the early release of serious criminals from prison. Last November the Home Secretary made an explicit pledge. He said that they had 'no plans or intention whatsoever to provide for \u0085 the early release of serious or sexual offenders. Let me make that clear, with a full stop - none whatever'. Yet he is releasing 2,600 convicted drug dealers, 2,300 thugs convicted of wounding, 1,700 burglars, 19 sex offenders, 22 people convicted of cruelty to children and 5 serving sentences for attempted murder. Of even greater concern is the fact that over 600 criminals released early have broken their curfew and 200 have committed crimes, including 31 assaults, 67 burglaries and 2 rapes. Either Jack Straw is the only person in Britain who regards none of these convictions as of a serious or sexual nature, or his promise not to release them early full stop was, like his promise of 5,000 extra police, worth nothing. Now the Home Secretary is planning to keep criminals in prison during the day and release them at night. Great thinking. This means they can't work, but they can burgle homes and mug people at night. I say instead of prison from 9 to 5, criminals should be locked up from 12 to 12, day and night. Some of the fiercest public criticism of the criminal justice system arises from the manifest failure to enforce probation orders and other non-custodial punishments effectively. When a criminal learns that he can defy the courts and that nothing much will happen to him, he is more likely to commit crime again. So if we are to start winning the war against crime then we have to enforce the sentence of the court. Here's what we are going to do: First, if someone on probation breaches their probation order just once then the court will be informed and it will have to take action. Second, the same principle applies to the conditional discharge. What's the point of a conditional discharge if the conditions aren't enforced? We will make sure that a breach of conditional discharge leads automatically to sentencing for the original offence. Third, we will take persistent young offenders off the streets. That means more secure training centres. And we will make young criminals sent to these centres subject to a new flexible detention order that links their release date to specific achievements tailored to each inmate. It might be a recognised qualification or even the basics like learning to read and write. Inmates would serve at least six months and the exact time of release would depend on the progress they had made. This proposal will punish, deter and rehabilitate younger offenders and protect the public from their crimes. And there is one further change to sentencing which I want to propose today. Back in 1988, we introduced for the first time in English legal history the right to appeal against an over-lenient sentence. At the time, many denounced this as a dangerous innovation. That is liberal establishment speak for straight-forward common sense. But the right of appeal applies only to a limited list of the most serious offences. Many crimes which spark real anger and fear amongst the public- GBH, ABH, burglary, racially aggravated offences - carry no such right to appeal. So we will extend the right to appeal against an over-lenient sentence to all so-called 'either-way' offences tried at the crown court. And we should apply the same, common sense approach to the out-moded rule that no-one may be tried twice for the same offence. By allowing a retrial in cases of jury or witness nobbling, we have already accepted that the double jeopardy rule is not sacrosanct. We should now go further. We believe that where new and compelling evidence of guilt comes to light - evidence which could not reasonably have been uncovered during the original investigation - the prosecution should be able to ask the court of appeal to order a second trial. It is just as much a miscarriage of justice when a guilty man escapes justice as when an innocent man goes to jail. Honest sentences. Enforcing probation orders and conditional discharges. Ending early release for serious crimes. Extending secure training centres and the right of appeal against lenient sentences. Reforming the double jeopardy rule. Putting victims first. These are Conservative policies which will go a long way to restoring public confidence in our criminal justice system. They go hand in hand with our commitment to a larger, better supported, more motivated police force that is free to do its job. For we can't win that war without your help. I commit the Conservative party here today to ensuring that you have all the political backing you need to be the strongest, most professional and best respected police force in the world. And I want you to know that you will be backed up with a criminal justice system that scares the hell out of criminals, and deserves the trust of the people it protects. We can cut crime. We can make people feel safer in their homes and on the streets. Provided you are allowed to do your job and we give you the unequivocal, unapologetic, unstinting support you so richly deserve.",

Over the following days a similar caller rang posing as a newspaper requiring her to pick up a non-existent competition prize, a car rental company with a hire car ready for collection, and an invented local hospital, informing her that her husband had had a car accident. \"A threat to report further calls to BT and the police put an end to these calls,\" she says. </p> <p>Helen Norris was cold-called by a double-glazing firm on Easter Saturday. When she declined their offer and put the phone down the caller promptly rang back. This happened several times until the caller became abusive. \"When I laid the receiver down she began shouting until I could bear it no longer, but if I hung up she'd ring back,\" says Norris. \"Eventually I asked for her supervisor's number and rang it to find it was a homosexual advice line.\" Later Norris tried calling the company on several listed numbers but all were unobtainable. </p> <p>Norris was, in fact, registered with the telephone preference service, which is supposed to put a stop to such calls. Debbie Goodkin, Lucy Cloonan, Steve Mayer and Elizabeth Bigg all suggest the service as the best method of prevention. \"It's reduced the number of calls but the best thing is that you have the satisfaction of telling unwanted callers that what they're doing is illegal,\" says Mayer. </p> <p>Householders can register on 0845 070 0707 and if companies still bother them the TPS will take up the complaint. </p> <p>A Simpson has perfected the fob-off: \"I'm so glad you called.

If, for instance, the opening line is \"How are you today?\", try answering \"I'm so glad you asked, because no one these days seems to care. My arthritis... \" If \"Judy of XYZ company\" announces herself, cry out in surprise, \"Judy, is that you? Oh my God, Judy, how have you been?\" Or pretend to believe that the caller is really your friend, Leon, playing a joke: \"Come on Leon, cut it out! Seriously Leon, how's your mother?\" </p> <p><strong> C&amp;W gets boxed in</strong><br> Despite the above, CA Eddington, of Bushey in Herts, still wants a telephone. She hasn't managed it yet, and for why? Because she entrusted the task to - you've guessed it - Cable &amp; Wireless. Engineers called twice over four weeks and reported that there were no available lines in the junction box, but a connection charge was none the less debited from Eddington's account. Eddington was asked to wait a further eight weeks by which time the box would be upgraded. Three months later she rang to inquire and a third appointment was made but no one turned up. C&amp;W informed her that they'd sent her a letter of cancellation by second class post the day before. The upgrade, they explained, was too expensive and she'd have to wait another six months. \"Five months later we still have no line or prospect of one and have waited in on four occasions without result,\" says Eddington. </p> <p>\u0095 Lo and behold! The day after Consumer alerts C&amp;W's press office an installation date is arranged, although whether it succeeds remains to be seen. \"There was a communications breakdown,\" says a spokeswoman. \"The customer's details were entered wrongly into our computer and she was given wrong information for which we apologise.\" </p> <p><strong> Too-mobile phone</strong><br> Mark Hayward of Basildon has also been spared the aggravation of cold callers thanks to Telewest. His telephone line was cut off without warning and an engineer discovered that his number had been transferred to a new customer. Said engineer then broke an appointment for the following day and Hayward was left phoneless over the weekend until the line mysteriously reinstated itself. </p> <p>Since then, however, he has experienced severe problems connecting with his internet server. Worse, when his phone bill arrived it contained numerous unfamiliar calls - presumably made by the neighbour who briefly inherited his phone number. Customer services said it had no record of the calls and couldn't help and two letters have met with no reply. </p> <p>\u0095 A repentant Telewest promises to investigate and has contacted Hayward with an apology, a refund for the disputed phone calls and \u00a325 in compensation.</p> <p><strong> Can't credit it</strong><br> Kimon Roussopoulos of Cambridge can't be alone in his plight which is that, having returned to his native Britain after spending six years in Switzerland, he has no credit history. \"Hence I'm having extreme difficulty getting access to services like a mobile phone. I have to pay deposits to BT and am unable to rent a television,\" he says. \"I'm actually a person of fairly considerable means with an impeccable financial history, but that cuts no ice.\" </p> <p>\u0095 \"It's like starting as a 19-year-old all over again,\" says a spokesman for the credit traders' association. \"He should ask companies to review his application and get his bank to vouch for him, because the latter can liaise with his Swiss bank for details.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman from the credit reference agency Experian wonders if Roussopolous is on the electoral roll yet. \"This is more important to lenders than credit history because it's a way of checking names and addresses.\" The bad news is that applicants have to be resident at their new address on October 10 to be eligible for the roll issued the following February, so someone arriving at their new home on October 11 would have to wait 16 months to be registered. The good news is that a new bill is being laid before parliament to allow people to register as soon as they move house.</p>",

Helen Norris was cold-called by a double-glazing firm on Easter Saturday. When she declined their offer and put the phone down the caller promptly rang back. This happened several times until the caller became abusive. \"When I laid the receiver down she began shouting until I could bear it no longer, but if I hung up she'd ring back,\" says Norris. \"Eventually I asked for her supervisor's number and rang it to find it was a homosexual advice line.\" Later Norris tried calling the company on several listed numbers but all were unobtainable. Norris was, in fact, registered with the telephone preference service, which is supposed to put a stop to such calls. Debbie Goodkin, Lucy Cloonan, Steve Mayer and Elizabeth Bigg all suggest the service as the best method of prevention. \"It's reduced the number of calls but the best thing is that you have the satisfaction of telling unwanted callers that what they're doing is illegal,\" says Mayer. Householders can register on 0845 070 0707 and if companies still bother them the TPS will take up the complaint. A Simpson has perfected the fob-off: \"I'm so glad you called. I'm in the same game as you and I wonder if I can interest you in a timeshare in Sierra Leone.\" John Armstrong has a variation. \"Say 'I'm glad you called because I've just started my own phone sales business and was wondering if you'd listen to my spiel and give me your professional opinion.'\" When all fails, an email currently doing the rounds lists 20 responses to use with telemarketers. If, for instance, the opening line is \"How are you today?\", try answering \"I'm so glad you asked, because no one these days seems to care. My arthritis... \" If \"Judy of XYZ company\" announces herself, cry out in surprise, \"Judy, is that you? Oh my God, Judy, how have you been?\" Or pretend to believe that the caller is really your friend, Leon, playing a joke: \"Come on Leon, cut it out! Seriously Leon, how's your mother?\" C&amp;W gets boxed in Despite the above, CA Eddington, of Bushey in Herts, still wants a telephone. She hasn't managed it yet, and for why? Because she entrusted the task to - you've guessed it - Cable &amp; Wireless. Engineers called twice over four weeks and reported that there were no available lines in the junction box, but a connection charge was none the less debited from Eddington's account. Eddington was asked to wait a further eight weeks by which time the box would be upgraded. Three months later she rang to inquire and a third appointment was made but no one turned up. C&amp;W informed her that they'd sent her a letter of cancellation by second class post the day before. The upgrade, they explained, was too expensive and she'd have to wait another six months. \"Five months later we still have no line or prospect of one and have waited in on four occasions without result,\" says Eddington. \u0095 Lo and behold! The day after Consumer alerts C&amp;W's press office an installation date is arranged, although whether it succeeds remains to be seen. \"There was a communications breakdown,\" says a spokeswoman. \"The customer's details were entered wrongly into our computer and she was given wrong information for which we apologise.\" Too-mobile phone Mark Hayward of Basildon has also been spared the aggravation of cold callers thanks to Telewest. His telephone line was cut off without warning and an engineer discovered that his number had been transferred to a new customer. Said engineer then broke an appointment for the following day and Hayward was left phoneless over the weekend until the line mysteriously reinstated itself. Since then, however, he has experienced severe problems connecting with his internet server. Worse, when his phone bill arrived it contained numerous unfamiliar calls - presumably made by the neighbour who briefly inherited his phone number. Customer services said it had no record of the calls and couldn't help and two letters have met with no reply. \u0095 A repentant Telewest promises to investigate and has contacted Hayward with an apology, a refund for the disputed phone calls and \u00a325 in compensation. Can't credit it Kimon Roussopoulos of Cambridge can't be alone in his plight which is that, having returned to his native Britain after spending six years in Switzerland, he has no credit history. \"Hence I'm having extreme difficulty getting access to services like a mobile phone. I have to pay deposits to BT and am unable to rent a television,\" he says. \"I'm actually a person of fairly considerable means with an impeccable financial history, but that cuts no ice.\" \u0095 \"It's like starting as a 19-year-old all over again,\" says a spokesman for the credit traders' association. \"He should ask companies to review his application and get his bank to vouch for him, because the latter can liaise with his Swiss bank for details.\" A spokeswoman from the credit reference agency Experian wonders if Roussopolous is on the electoral roll yet. \"This is more important to lenders than credit history because it's a way of checking names and addresses.\" The bad news is that applicants have to be resident at their new address on October 10 to be eligible for the roll issued the following February, so someone arriving at their new home on October 11 would have to wait 16 months to be registered. The good news is that a new bill is being laid before parliament to allow people to register as soon as they move house.",

But with another 270 UN peacekeepers and military observers remaining captive, a partnership between Ecomog and the UN may prove difficult as Nigeria's desire to take the battle to the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels will clash with the UN's primary role of peacekeeping. Nigeria has expressed its willingness to return to Sierra Leone provided that it is allowed to get on with the job in its own way. A Nigerian-led Ecomog force helped restore President Tejjan Kabbah to power after he was thrown out of power briefly in a coup by dissident soldiers. \"We are of the view that if we take command of the force its activities will be more result-orientated, because we understand the terrain better, and we will have more troops on the ground,\" said Nigeria's chief of army staff, Major-General Victor Malu.

Who needs to talk about overthrowing the government when they are free to talk about their own sexual feelings, without any ideological or moral strings attached? \"In the old days you had to stay in sexless relationships with your partner whether you wanted to or not, because the party said so,\" says Carrie Gracie, the former Beijing bureau chief for the BBC. \"There was no morality, only restrictions. Now the restrictions have been lifted there is nothing left to contain people. And the criteria people use to decide who they want to be with have been turned completely upside down.\" Putting aside the impact of this in terms of broken marriages, another way to see China's urban sex explosion is as an essential ingredient for civil life - alongside things like a broad educational base, respect for law and tolerance of minorities. It's simple: the state becomes less centralised, provincial governors withhold taxes, hooligans set up businesses, rock stars sing of disillusionment, city entrepreneurs watch Taiwanese TV, nutters subscribe to mystical religions, Qi gong masters set themselves up as virtual messiahs - and, yes, people with erectile problems start talking about it on the radio. In China, it seems, the pluralist society has finally arrived. \u0095 Dr Chen's Sex Revolution, tonight, 9.30pm, BBC2. Jeremy Atiyah is co-author of The Rough Guide to China",

      "bodyText": "The use of depleted uranium weapons is again causing concern. The people of Kosovo have been alarmed to discover that the conflict there has left radioactive contamination, just as it did in Kuwait nine years ago. Why do the United States and Britain continue to use a waste product of the nuclear industry in their weapons? Some commentators allege that it is a conspiracy between the military and the nuclear industry to dispose of dangerous waste in hostile countries. The real reasons are more complex. Metallic uranium occurs naturally in tiny quantities. In its native state it is a mixture of highly radioactive uranium-235 and less active U-238. U-235 is used in reactors and atomic weapons; once it is extracted, the rest is depleted uranium (DU). It is a poisonous heavy metal like lead or mercury, but only slightly radioactive. To understand why DU makes a good anti-tank weapon you have to enter the Alice In Wonderland world of high-energy collisions. When metal meets metal at five times the speed of sound, hardened steel shatters like glass. Metal flows like putty, or simply vaporises. A faster shell does not necessarily go through more armour, but, like a pebble thrown into a pond, it makes a bigger splash. Armour penetration is increased by concentrating the force of a shell into as small an area as possible, so the projectiles tend to look like giant darts. The denser the projectile, the harder the impact for a given size. DU is almost twice as dense as lead, making it highly suitable. The other metal used for anti-tank rounds is tungsten, which is also very hard and dense. When a tungsten rod strikes armour, it deforms and mushrooms, making it progressively blunter. Uranium is \"pyrophoric\": at the point of impact it burns away into vapour, so the projectile stays sharp. When it breaks through, the burning DU turns the inside of a vehicle into an inferno of white-hot gas and sparks. Normal uranium is not as hard as tungsten. But a classified technique allows it to be hardened. This is believed to involve alloying it with titanium and cooling it so that it forms a single large metallic crystal rather than a chaotic mass of tiny crystals.

      "body": "<p>What a surprise. For the umpteenth time another big match is decided by penalties after a 'golden goal' period of extra time that's about as golden as a rain-cloud.</p> <p>At least last night's extra time between Galatasaray v Arsenal was reasonably interesting. Which is more than can be said for France v Holland and France v Czech Republic (in Euro 96) and France v Paraguay and France v Italy (in World Cup 98).</p> <p>But it's not the French who are the problem - it's the golden goal rule itself. </p> <p>According to Fifa spokesman Andrew Cooper: \"The idea behind the golden goal is to introduce a more attacking attitude, with teams going forward because they know that one goal will win the match.\"</p> <p>Unfortunately in practice the reverse has been true. Sides know that one mistake (or one over-aggressive attack) can ruin their chances, and so - with the honourable exception of England and Germany during Euro 96 - they nearly always temper their attacking ambitions. And the higher the stakes, the greater the tendency to play it safe.</p> <p>Four years after its introduction at the top level of football, the golden goal experiment has failed. The only question is what's the best way to replace it.</p> <p>The first option is to return to the previous status quo: play 30 minutes of extra time, with the team who's scored the most goals winning at the end. The trouble with this is that for every enthralling thriller (like France v Germany in 1982) there were at least twice as many games where extra time was stale and turgid, with teams hanging back for penalties. Does anyone remember Marseille v Red Star Belgrade in 1991?

      "bodyText": "What a surprise. For the umpteenth time another big match is decided by penalties after a 'golden goal' period of extra time that's about as golden as a rain-cloud. At least last night's extra time between Galatasaray v Arsenal was reasonably interesting. Which is more than can be said for France v Holland and France v Czech Republic (in Euro 96) and France v Paraguay and France v Italy (in World Cup 98). But it's not the French who are the problem - it's the golden goal rule itself. According to Fifa spokesman Andrew Cooper: \"The idea behind the golden goal is to introduce a more attacking attitude, with teams going forward because they know that one goal will win the match.\" Unfortunately in practice the reverse has been true. Sides know that one mistake (or one over-aggressive attack) can ruin their chances, and so - with the honourable exception of England and Germany during Euro 96 - they nearly always temper their attacking ambitions. And the higher the stakes, the greater the tendency to play it safe. Four years after its introduction at the top level of football, the golden goal experiment has failed. The only question is what's the best way to replace it. The first option is to return to the previous status quo: play 30 minutes of extra time, with the team who's scored the most goals winning at the end. The trouble with this is that for every enthralling thriller (like France v Germany in 1982) there were at least twice as many games where extra time was stale and turgid, with teams hanging back for penalties. Does anyone remember Marseille v Red Star Belgrade in 1991? Thought not. Another idea - which Cooper says has been discussed within the lower echelons of Fifa - is to make the first goal in extra time count double (rather like the away-goals rule). So if a game was 0-0 after normal time and 1-1 after extra time, the team that scored first would go through. This idea has its merits - but it is too similar to the existing golden goal rule. If teams knew that if they conceded a goal they'd need to score two to avoid losing, their defensive mindset would probably be locked firmly in place. My suggestion (which I know may not be to everybody's taste) is to scrap penalty shoot-outs altogether - and keep playing 15-minute periods until one side scores. It sounds slightly left-field, but it has its merits. Most importantly, it would take away the incentive to play defensive football. Why would any side play negatively if there was no prospect of penalties at the end of it? Just like 'last goal wins' in park football, teams would know that they could only win by attacking.

Traditional low-key papal birthday celebrations will be cast aside to make today's mass a highlight of the Vatican's holy year, or jubilee. Polish countrymen will sing the traditional birthday song Sto Lat (May you live 100 years) and the Vatican and Poland have also issued commemorative stamps showing the mature pope in profile.

The fact that cardinals aged over 80 are no longer allowed to vote in papal elections and that he has now joined their age group will not trouble him in the least: he is set apart by virtue of his office. The Pope knows best.</p> <p>These are all of course the very reasons why the present pope should stand down, in order to breathe new life and vigour into a waning papacy. Ironically, they may ultimately be the reason why that conclave of cardinals may choose a successor as unlike John Paul II as possible (the conclave has a history of doing this). How much better to step down now to preserve the integrity of his reign intact rather than waiting for the soft tread of the man with the silver hammer.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Today's celebrations at the Vatican for the 80th birthday of Pope John Paul II were overshadowed - as all such gatherings are these days - by the continuing gossip about the pontiff's health and ghoulish speculation about what will happen next. It is not just the world's media which is sitting like crows on a gatepost waiting for the end, but the church's hierarchy, from the smart, cassock-clad young men of the curia to the most senior scarlet-accoutred cardinal discreetly checking the plane times for the conclave, which will choose the pope's successor. Increasingly, there are murmurings that, as the pope grows ever more frail with Parkinson's disease, he might care to contemplate retirement to a monastery as a more comfortable alternative to a slow decline and then dying alone in his bed in the Vatican. As his predecessor, Pope John XXIII, once mournfully murmured, there is something infinitely sad about knowing that you are going to sleep every night in the bed in which you will be one day destined to die - even if, for pontiffs as much as any other priest, death must surely only be the prelude to something infinitely more glorious, that they have spent their whole lives preparing for. But before the papal chamberlain approaches the bed armed with the silver hammer with which he will strike the pope's head - the traditional test to determine whether he is really dead or merely sleeping - the retirement option is one which ought to be seriously considered. There are precedents, though admittedly not recent ones, not many of them and not always embraced voluntarily, but John Paul II, who has already had the longest reign for more than 120 years, might like to consider the advantages of becoming the first pope since Gregory XII in 1415 to step down early. The chances are that he will not do so. This is a Pope very sure of his destiny and of his personal indispensability. Like the Queen, he has many virtues, but resignation is not one of them. More than most, he will be keen that his legacy of rightwing theological orthodoxy is maintained. He has consciously constructed it during the 22 years of his papacy: the curia is set in his image, and no less than 94 of the 106 cardinals who will choose his successor are his appointees. The fact that cardinals aged over 80 are no longer allowed to vote in papal elections and that he has now joined their age group will not trouble him in the least: he is set apart by virtue of his office. The Pope knows best. These are all of course the very reasons why the present pope should stand down, in order to breathe new life and vigour into a waning papacy. Ironically, they may ultimately be the reason why that conclave of cardinals may choose a successor as unlike John Paul II as possible (the conclave has a history of doing this). How much better to step down now to preserve the integrity of his reign intact rather than waiting for the soft tread of the man with the silver hammer.",

Ms Quin [Joyce Quin, agriculture, fisheries and food minister]: We are taking several new steps to ensure seed purity, in addition to the current consultation on the importation and labelling of seeds. These include pressing internationally for agreed standards, testing of seed imports to the UK and working with the industry on a code of practice. The need for action in this area is highlighted by the recent information we have received from Advanta Seeds UK that some of its conventional rapeseed sold and sown in 1999 and 2000 in several EU member states, including the UK, contained about 1 per cent. of genetically modified rapeseed. The genetic modification in question has already been assessed and cleared for food use and for field trials in the UK. We have consulted both ACRE (The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment) and the Food Standards Agency who have confirmed the view that there is no risk to public health or the environment.",

You and Your Wedding magazine estimates the industry to be worth a staggering \u00a34.5bn, with an average spend of \u00a314,500 on the big day. Weddings are big business - and the expanding industry is ensuring that we spend more than ever on getting it just right. </p> <p>Mailshots by everyone from bakers to slimming agencies start arriving as soon as the engagement is announced in the newspapers or the couple registers with one of the multiplying nuptial websites. Then there are the wedding guides, all claiming to steer us safely through these perilous waters. Most are good at the obvious - counselling us to choose a dress that we like and to check that there are lavatories at the reception venue - but those who embark on the enterprise are likely to be bruised by unmentioned pitfalls. </p> <p>The best tip is to do the deed between October and March, when fewer people marry and companies are more inclined to bargain to secure custom. And plan well ahead. Many venues, florists and car hire companies are booked more than a year ahead and even wedding list companies require at least three or four months notice. </p> <p>For those still tempted, here are some of the stings in the marketplace that no one ever tells you about. </p> <p> <strong> The dress</strong> </p> <p> Fancy a day off in town and a leisurely browse through the bridal shops? Forget it. Most stores insist on an appointment before you can ask questions or try on, and smaller boutiques won't even let you in to flick through their rails unless you've pre-booked up to a fortnight beforehand. </p> <p>And once shut in the hallowed precincts with an assistant it takes a steely will to resist the sales pressure as gown after gown is brought forth. A stiff gin is required to cope with the prices. The national average is \u00a3700 and for anything more stylish than a glorified sundress expect to pay \u00a31,000 plus. You don't buy off the peg even in department stores. The dress is either made up for you to a standard size, or created bespoke, and if you are a trifle larger or smaller than average expect to be talked into the bespoke option with its 10-20% premium. Surprisingly, it can be much cheaper to get a gown made by an independent dressmaker who will have fewer overheads and perhaps a better idea of personal service. </p> <p> <strong> The reception venue</strong> </p> <p> The biggest headache of all. The real fun begins if your chosen establishment does not have in-house caterers. Most, especially historic ones, will insist you choose from a list of approved caterers - which launches you into a mathematical nightmare. Many \"forget\" to add VAT on to their quotes, requiring you to set to work with a calculator. Some prices include china, cutlery, glassware and waiting staff, others don't. One might look pricier than the other until you find they throw in a half-bottle of wine per head. </p> <p>The wine, indeed, is the best lark of the lot. Some venues charge you a hefty corkage if you don't buy your wine from them, while your approved caterer may fine you if you do. The same goes for hotels, which can charge up to \u00a318 corkage per bottle if you bring your own champagne. And beware: some hotels keep the cost of their food low to attract you, then clobber you for the drink. Watch too for those alluring packages which offer room hire, food and drink inclusive. It might mean that the wine flow is heavily restricted and while top table rejoices in liberal helpings of the best, the lower ranks are going thirsty. The solution is not to give the staff carte blanche to serve up as much as is needed, because you have no way of keeping tabs on what goes on the final bill. Instead, tell them to consult you when the pre-purchased supplies run low and authorise a set number of new bottles. But don't, whatever you do, get carried away with joie de vivre. Most venues will set a deadline for your departure; exceed that by 20 minutes and you pay twice. </p> <p> <strong> Invitations</strong> </p> <p> Hopeful stationery companies will fling themselves at you once your engagement is made public. Many of the larger ones end up farming out your order to a printer so you end up paying the printing costs and the middleman. They may also be less flexible about the order size, meaning you could end up paying for far more than you need. It can cost you up to half the price if you go to a small printing firm, many of which sell directly to the public, and which should be more amenable to small orders. </p> <p> <strong> Florists</strong> </p> <p> There is a certain snobbery in the flower industry and designers at the top end of the market might insist on working with exclusive blooms for a corresponding price, whereas your local florist will be content to knock together a posy of roses. Don't be tempted to ask said florist to emulate a design by one of the professional designers in the hope of cutting costs, because you get what you pay for and floral artistry is an expensively acquired skill. </p> <p>Things get more complicated if you live at one end of the country and plan to marry at the other. The chances are you won't have time to seek out a good supplier near the venue and you may already be smitten with one on your home patch. Will they travel and will the blooms look as fresh as they did when they get there? </p> <p>Self-employed flower decorators who buy the best they can find in the market within your budget are a good solution. They often charge competitively because they have no shop and low overheads and are used to travelling. Florists accustomed to doing arrangements in their shop might find extra decorations are needed when they get to the venue and won't have the necessaries with them. </p> <p> <strong> The cake</strong> </p> <p> Check the tiers and top decorations are included in the quote and ask about travelling charges. You won't be able to transport it on the day and it's too much responsibility for a friend. The best fruit cakes should be kept for several weeks to mature, but if the storage is inadequate the cake will be dry. Ask, therefore, to taste a few samples of previously baked creations. The average cake costs \u00a3200 and much of that goes into the fiddly sugar flowers. You can cut costs by settling for fresh or silk blooms or silk invitations. </p> <p> <strong> Transport</strong> </p> <p>Most car hire companies charge a flat rate of around \u00a3100, be it for 10 miles or 10 yards.

      "body": "<p>Will success spoil Linux? After a spectacular rise from little known, hobbyist operating system to the fastest growing OS in the computing market and bona fide commercial phenomenon, Linux is at the centre of some collective soul-searching. </p> <p>The freely available operating system, initially developed by Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds and honed by a vast volunteer programmer \"community\", represents the first triumph for the open source software movement. Open source adherents advocate sharing the code, or basic digital blueprint, for software programs. Programs are developed over time by a sprawling collective. Basically, anyone can work on a bit of the system as long as any new code is also kept public, and programs are either free or available for a nominal sum. </p> <p>This \"gift economy\" - the idea that if one gives something freely to the wider community, one will in turn receive things - is at the heart of the open source movement and the genesis of Linux. Of course, this is at odds with the greedy world of big software and hardware companies, profits, initial public offerings and acquisitions. That's what makes Linux's rise and rise one of technology's most curious tales. It's as if a small-town community football team suddenly found itself in Old Trafford with every prospect of beating Man United. </p> <p>\"It's an absolutely fascinating development, and it's glowing red-hot in the US,\" says analyst Martin Hingley, vice president of the European systems group in the UK offices of International Data Corporation (IDC). Why? \"The customer is looking to avoid being tied to a single source [for an operating system],\" he says. Linux can be downloaded by anyone for free from the internet, or, if you opt for some CDs and instructions, is available from companies such as Red Hat and SuSE at a small charge (under \u00a350). At last count, more than 145 sources offered a version of Linux. </p> <p>\"The benefit is control,\" says Red Hat's chief executive Bob Young. \"People are no longer beholden to their vendor.\" If Linux is (in the favourite American phrase) the poster child of the open source movement, then North Carolina-based Red Hat is the poster child for Linux. Yet such are the odd twists and turns of the Linux tale, that Red Hat itself is now seen by some as the Linux vendor that's getting too big and too successful, following an initial public offering (IPO) and the establishment of its own acquisitions fund. </p> <p>Analysts agree that Red Hat fuelled Linux's success after it drew much-publicised investments from Intel and Netscape a year and a half ago. The Intel stake in particular raised eyebrows, since Linux is seen increasingly as a growing threat to Microsoft's domination in the OS market with Windows, and Intel and Microsoft had been partners for years. </p> <p>Publicly, Microsoft had belittled Linux, but a leaked memo in October 1998, <a href=\"http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/halloween.html\">(www.tuxedo.org/~esr/halloween.html)</a> expressed Bill Gates's true fears. \"The journalists thought we were the David to Microsoft's Goliath but we had more engineers working on the OS than Microsoft did on Windows,\" says Young. </p> <p>Linux suddenly had the friends in high places needed to get a firm foothold in the corporate marketplace, and software and hardware players practically stumbled over themselves to bring out a Linux product. Corel, Oracle, SAP, Compaq, Dell, IBM, Applix, Informix and Computer Associates all support Linux. The stellar roster of support in turn spurred investor fever and at the end of last year, tiny Linux-based companies saw their valuations head into the ozone when they went public. VA Linux's shares alone jumped 498% on their opening day, setting a market record. </p> <p>Those developments have been crucial to Linux's rise, says Alan Cox, a core programmer and maintainer of the <a href=\"http://www.linux.org.uk\">www.linux.org.uk</a> website. \"The rest of the world [has seen] free software going from a crazy concept to a marketed advantage and marketed in a way that the business community understands. The stock market flotations also gave [Linux] a definite air of reality.\" </p> <p>But Linux's success isn't just spin. \"There has been a lot of Linux hype from companies either because they sell Linux products or because they see it as a stick to bash Bill Gates with (or both). Hype doesn't actually create a large user base and sustained deployment which Linux, unlike Java, is getting.\" </p> <p>In particular, Linux has gone from being seen as a desktop system for ubergeeks to colonising the server market, due to its reliability, say analysts. It's now the operating system of choice on 25% of all new server shipments, up from 16% in 1998, according to IDC. Up to 30% of web servers run Linux, according to some estimates. </p> <p>Linux is expected to see 25% growth every year until 2004, and more than a third of enterprises use or plan to use Linux within the year, according to a recent report by analyst Booz-Allen and Hamilton. The number of Linux users grew from about 1,000 in 1992 to nine million last year, says the Tower Group, which predicts worldwide spending by the top 100 financial institutions on Linux will grow 32% a year - from $50m in 1998 to more than $200m in 2003. </p> <p>Critics insist Linux will not move beyond servers into the so-called enterprise market of crucial computing functions in big corporations: after all, they say, who will trust a system that is free or comes from young companies just learning how to offer service? </p> <p>But a Gartner Group survey of 650 companies indicates that 5% intend to use Linux this year for essential computing operations, and 13% say they will do so in the next year. In a much-watched development, IBM has signalled it intends to support Linux. Already the company has Linux up and running on its S/390 mainframe. </p> <p>\"We believe Linux could be the defining platform for all new applications,\" says IBM enterprise server vice president Launy Vang Anderson. IBM envisions Linux running alongside a business's earlier operating system on the S/390, giving access to a company's old data. He says it is easier to make big enterprise software programs such as SAP run on Linux than other operating systems such as commercial Unix offerings or Microsoft's Windows 2000 or NT. IBM thinks it can make money fromLinux by offering support and services - a plan which must make companies like Red Hat, modelled on the same business plan, nervous. </p> <p>At the other end of the scale, Linux is increasingly the OS of choice for appliances: it is lean and agile, with a fraction of the code in commercial operating systems. Oracle, Intel, Gateway and NTL have all announced internet access appliances running Linux, and net access appliances are expected to overtakePCs in number by 2005. </p> <p>So many uses for Linux, and so many vendors in the field, have led to concerns that Linux will \"fragment\" - split into a number of incompatible, competing OS offerings from different companies. Unix never became the strong, standardised OS many had hoped. With this in mind Linux, which is a clone of Unix, was created to succeed where Unix failed. Red Hat's Young argues that Linux will remain whole because Linus Torvalds still controls the software's core code, or \"kernel\". </p> <p>Torvalds, in his Ask Linus column at <a href=\"http://www.linuxnews.com\">www.linuxnews.com</a>, says: \"What will happen is that the 'market' fragments, as opposed to the technology.

      "bodyText": "Will success spoil Linux? After a spectacular rise from little known, hobbyist operating system to the fastest growing OS in the computing market and bona fide commercial phenomenon, Linux is at the centre of some collective soul-searching. The freely available operating system, initially developed by Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds and honed by a vast volunteer programmer \"community\", represents the first triumph for the open source software movement. Open source adherents advocate sharing the code, or basic digital blueprint, for software programs. Programs are developed over time by a sprawling collective. Basically, anyone can work on a bit of the system as long as any new code is also kept public, and programs are either free or available for a nominal sum. This \"gift economy\" - the idea that if one gives something freely to the wider community, one will in turn receive things - is at the heart of the open source movement and the genesis of Linux. Of course, this is at odds with the greedy world of big software and hardware companies, profits, initial public offerings and acquisitions. That's what makes Linux's rise and rise one of technology's most curious tales. It's as if a small-town community football team suddenly found itself in Old Trafford with every prospect of beating Man United. \"It's an absolutely fascinating development, and it's glowing red-hot in the US,\" says analyst Martin Hingley, vice president of the European systems group in the UK offices of International Data Corporation (IDC). Why? \"The customer is looking to avoid being tied to a single source [for an operating system],\" he says. Linux can be downloaded by anyone for free from the internet, or, if you opt for some CDs and instructions, is available from companies such as Red Hat and SuSE at a small charge (under \u00a350). At last count, more than 145 sources offered a version of Linux. \"The benefit is control,\" says Red Hat's chief executive Bob Young. \"People are no longer beholden to their vendor.\" If Linux is (in the favourite American phrase) the poster child of the open source movement, then North Carolina-based Red Hat is the poster child for Linux. Yet such are the odd twists and turns of the Linux tale, that Red Hat itself is now seen by some as the Linux vendor that's getting too big and too successful, following an initial public offering (IPO) and the establishment of its own acquisitions fund. Analysts agree that Red Hat fuelled Linux's success after it drew much-publicised investments from Intel and Netscape a year and a half ago. The Intel stake in particular raised eyebrows, since Linux is seen increasingly as a growing threat to Microsoft's domination in the OS market with Windows, and Intel and Microsoft had been partners for years. Publicly, Microsoft had belittled Linux, but a leaked memo in October 1998, (www.tuxedo.org/~esr/halloween.html) expressed Bill Gates's true fears. \"The journalists thought we were the David to Microsoft's Goliath but we had more engineers working on the OS than Microsoft did on Windows,\" says Young. Linux suddenly had the friends in high places needed to get a firm foothold in the corporate marketplace, and software and hardware players practically stumbled over themselves to bring out a Linux product. Corel, Oracle, SAP, Compaq, Dell, IBM, Applix, Informix and Computer Associates all support Linux. The stellar roster of support in turn spurred investor fever and at the end of last year, tiny Linux-based companies saw their valuations head into the ozone when they went public. VA Linux's shares alone jumped 498% on their opening day, setting a market record. Those developments have been crucial to Linux's rise, says Alan Cox, a core programmer and maintainer of the www.linux.org.uk website. \"The rest of the world [has seen] free software going from a crazy concept to a marketed advantage and marketed in a way that the business community understands. The stock market flotations also gave [Linux] a definite air of reality.\" But Linux's success isn't just spin. \"There has been a lot of Linux hype from companies either because they sell Linux products or because they see it as a stick to bash Bill Gates with (or both). Hype doesn't actually create a large user base and sustained deployment which Linux, unlike Java, is getting.\" In particular, Linux has gone from being seen as a desktop system for ubergeeks to colonising the server market, due to its reliability, say analysts. It's now the operating system of choice on 25% of all new server shipments, up from 16% in 1998, according to IDC. Up to 30% of web servers run Linux, according to some estimates. Linux is expected to see 25% growth every year until 2004, and more than a third of enterprises use or plan to use Linux within the year, according to a recent report by analyst Booz-Allen and Hamilton. The number of Linux users grew from about 1,000 in 1992 to nine million last year, says the Tower Group, which predicts worldwide spending by the top 100 financial institutions on Linux will grow 32% a year - from $50m in 1998 to more than $200m in 2003. Critics insist Linux will not move beyond servers into the so-called enterprise market of crucial computing functions in big corporations: after all, they say, who will trust a system that is free or comes from young companies just learning how to offer service? But a Gartner Group survey of 650 companies indicates that 5% intend to use Linux this year for essential computing operations, and 13% say they will do so in the next year. In a much-watched development, IBM has signalled it intends to support Linux. Already the company has Linux up and running on its S/390 mainframe. \"We believe Linux could be the defining platform for all new applications,\" says IBM enterprise server vice president Launy Vang Anderson. IBM envisions Linux running alongside a business's earlier operating system on the S/390, giving access to a company's old data. He says it is easier to make big enterprise software programs such as SAP run on Linux than other operating systems such as commercial Unix offerings or Microsoft's Windows 2000 or NT. IBM thinks it can make money fromLinux by offering support and services - a plan which must make companies like Red Hat, modelled on the same business plan, nervous. At the other end of the scale, Linux is increasingly the OS of choice for appliances: it is lean and agile, with a fraction of the code in commercial operating systems. Oracle, Intel, Gateway and NTL have all announced internet access appliances running Linux, and net access appliances are expected to overtakePCs in number by 2005. So many uses for Linux, and so many vendors in the field, have led to concerns that Linux will \"fragment\" - split into a number of incompatible, competing OS offerings from different companies. Unix never became the strong, standardised OS many had hoped. With this in mind Linux, which is a clone of Unix, was created to succeed where Unix failed. Red Hat's Young argues that Linux will remain whole because Linus Torvalds still controls the software's core code, or \"kernel\". Torvalds, in his Ask Linus column at www.linuxnews.com, says: \"What will happen is that the 'market' fragments, as opposed to the technology. Which is good and proper. You'll have different Linux companies going after different markets, and having different priorities. Which means that you won't have any one particular 'Microsoft of Linux': you'll have dominant players, but they'll be dominant in the areas that they are good at. And nobody ever ends up being the best at everything.\" Torvalds, who speaks half-jokingly of Linux achieving \"total world domination\", is clearly comfortable with commercial success (although he will not work for a company that could directly make money off Linux - he sees it as a conflict of interest). So is Cox, who thinks that developers are nonetheless more loyal to Linux than a company they work for, and that Linux will never produce \"Microsoft-like profits\". The developer community, though, still wrestles with the idea of blending success and Linux. Discussion lists on the pro-Linux site Slashdot have dissected the issue from every angle for months. \"I write free software to make people (not least myself) happy.

That 1961-62 series was a peculiar one: the first Test was played in October 1961, and the second in January 1962, after England played five Tests in India. Since then England have made five Test-playing tours of Pakistan: the 1968-69, 1972-73 and 1977-78 series were drawn 0-0, then Pakistan won 1-0 in both 1983-84 and 1987-88.</p> <p> <strong>In 1996-97 Hasan Raza made his Test debut, supposedly aged only 14 years 227 days.

He also played one Test for England, against Australia at Headingley in 1905. He took 5 for 57 and 1 for 56 - he dismissed the legendary Australian batsman Victor Trumper in both innings - and scored 7, so looks unlucky not to have played again. In all first-class cricket Warren scored 5507 runs, with one century, and took 939 wickets at an average of 24.55. He later became a first-class umpire, and also played league football for Brentford, Derby and Glossop.

      "bodyText": "The government was yesterday struggling to hold together its wait-and-see policy on the single currency after Peter Mandelson exposed ministers to attacks from both pro- and anti-euro camps with his remarks over the damage to industry caused by the strong pound. Despite fresh evidence of job losses in industry, Tony Blair insisted there was no cabinet split over whether Britain should join monetary union and the Treasury said it would not risk economic stability by bowing to pressure for a short-term fix. But the statement by the Northern Ireland secretary, that business would continue to suffer from exchange rate volatility while Britain remained outside the euro, gave the Conservative leader, William Hague, ammunition to attack the government in question time. Challenging the prime minister to say whether Mr Mandelson was speaking on behalf of the government, Mr Hague asked: \"Why did Mr Mandelson yesterday blow open your real intentions on the euro?\" With Mr Mandelson sitting beside him, Mr Blair replied: \"I don't even accept the premise of your question. \"What Peter Mandelson said - perfectly rightly - was that of course if you are outside a currency area then your exchange rate will vary against the currencies inside it. I would have thought even you could have got that one.\" The debate over Mr Mandelson's intervention also gave pro-Europeans an opportunity to underline their argument that Britain's opt-out from the euro was inflicting pain on large chunks of industry. Armed with official figures showing that 210,000 jobs have been lost in manufacturing over the past year, Kitty Ussher, chief economist for the pro-Europe lobby group, Britain in Europe, said: \"Anti-Europeans claim that the serious job losses in manufacturing industry are due to a high tax and regulatory burden in the UK. But this is merely a smokescreen to hide the damage being done by the high pound. \"It does not suit the anti-European ideology to admit that the overvalued pound is crushing British manufacturing. But that is the hard truth facing British industry today.\" Both old and new industries reported yesterday that they were suffering with the strong pound. Coca-Cola said its earnings in Europe were being hit, while the IT consultancy CMG issued a profits warning. \"Our figures for 2000, when reported in sterling, will not provide a full reflection of the good operational growth rates in local currencies,\" said the CMG chairman, Cor Stutterheim. The Treasury, while accepting the strong pound was causing problems for some sectors, said using entry into the euro as a way out of short-term difficulties would risk a return to the boom-bust cycle of the late 80s and early 90s. With figures out yesterday showing that the number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell by 28,000 in April to a 20-year low of 1,111,800, Gordon Brown is insisting that the government sticks by the euro policy outlined in October 1997. This involves the government assessing whether economic tests for entry have been met, early in the next parliament. After a lunchtime meeting between the chancellor and the prime minister yesterday, Mr Blair deflected attempts to bounce him into expressing an opinion on whether those conditions would be met. The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, demanded clarification of whether Mr Mandelson had been speaking on behalf of the government. Mr Blair said there were three positions to take on the single currency. \"One is to rule it out as a matter of principle, the second is to say that you will join now, immediately, and the third is to say that whether you join or not depends on the economic conditions being met. \"But the timing depends on the economic conditions ... and the sensible position on the single currency is to say the test is jobs and industry and British investment.\"",

      "bodyText": "History risks repeating itself after the head of Massey Ferguson, warned that the company's Coventry plant, which employs 1,800, could close if sterling remains so strong. It is not the first time exchange rates have threatened the future of the world's biggest tractor factory. A dispute over the pound-dollar rate stalled talks 48 years ago between Harry Ferguson of Coventry and his US rival Massey Harris to create Massey Ferguson. Back then Mr Ferguson suggested tossing a coin to settle the row. He lost $1m. That was a personal tragedy, but the closure of the Banner Lane works would be an industrial blow on a grand scale. Robert Ratliff, chairman of the US Agco Corporation, which now owns Massey Ferguson, raised the spectre as he complained that the pound-euro rate had put the plant under pressure for three years. Coventry exports 70% of its output, and sterling's rise is leaving it uncompetitive compared with other tractor producers, including the Massey Ferguson factory in Beauvis, France. \"The strong pound is not favouring our continued presence in the UK,\" declared Mr Ratliff as he urged the government to join the euro. The company is in a struggling sector, manufacturing, and is trying to sell in a declining sector, agriculture. Three hundred Coventry jobs have already gone, and the workforce has been put on a four-day week this month. Only 14,000 machines were made last year, way below the factory's 25,000 capacity, and closure would be a big blow to the West Midlands. Costs are being cut by buying cheaper, imported components, and UK suppliers have been asked to quote parts prices in euros below the official exchange rate. \"If that doesn't work we will be forced into considering the relocation of production to other more suitable facilities,\" said Mr Ratliff. \"For quite some time I have suggested that the UK being part of the euro would balance the economic cost structure for manufacturers and allow the UK to remain a strong competitor for the European and American markets.\" He recently \"terminated\" 1,000 American employees to slash costs, and British unions believe the threat to Coventry is real. Peter Booth, the Transport and General Workers' Union national organiser for manufacturing, said: \"We have to take this statement seriously in terms of people's livelihoods. \"The high pound against the euro is posing real problems for exporters and with high interest rates is contributing to chronic underinvestment in industry. \"The weak euro avoided a recession in Europe, while the strong pound is costing jobs in Britain. You have to ask yourself whether we have been suckered.\" Nissan, Peugeot and a series of other foreign-owned manufacturers have warned that the high pound could scupper investment plans, but the famous tractor producer is the first to threaten to quit Britain. Massey Ferguson has also suffered from the Asian economic crisis, and some experts in the West Midlands suspect that Mr Ratliff is sabre-rattling to put pressure on the government, rather than planning to pull out. Nick Madeley of the Coventry and Warwickshire chamber of commerce said: \"There are many firms in the area who are upping productivity to cope with the exchange difference. I would doubt if Agco could find a better production centre.\" Coventry has built 3m tractors since it was opened in 1946.

      "bodyText": "Euro-MPs are poised to deliver a resounding response today to the rise of rightwing extremism by approving the first EU-wide anti-racism legislation. In a long-awaited vote in Strasbourg, a substantial majority is expected for laws banning racial harassment and victimisation as well as introducing sweeping protection against race discrimination in education, employment, access to grants, social protection and social security. Another key feature of the new laws will be the reversal of the burden of proof in civil race discrimination cases. The so-called race directive, strongly backed by organisations such as the commission for racial equality in the UK, is part of a package of ground-breaking anti-discrimination legislation. It will require amendments to Britain's 1976 Race Relations Act to incorporate harassment and the new definition of \"indirect discrimination\". The legislation is designed to set a minimum standard of legal protection against discrimination across the 15-member union. Richard Howitt, Labour MEP for eastern England, last night called the directive \"the biggest breakthrough in British race relations for a quarter of a century\". He added: \"Rightwing extremism is on the rise, not just in Austria, but throughout Europe. This legislation sends the strongest signal to J\u00f6rg Haider [leading light of Austria's Freedom party], David Irving [the second world war historian] and every thug who commits a racist crime on Britain's streets.

Crucially, the directive requires a shift in the burden of proof from complainant to respondent, recognising the fact that it can be difficult to obtain evidence in discrimination cases. The onus will be on the accused to prove their innocence \"once the complainant has clearly established facts from which a court or tribunal can presume discrimination\". The race directive also incorporates the notion of \"indirect discrimination\", which exists in UK law but is barely recognised elsewhere in the EU. It extends race discrimination to include situations \"where an apparently neutral provision is liable to adversely affect a person or group of particular racial or ethnic origin\". It also provides protection to third country nationals against discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin - thus helping, for example, a Moroccan in Spain as well as a Rwandan in Belgium. Member states are required to publicise measures covered by the directive, including information about available assistance. Amendments introduced by the European parliament will require companies to prove that they comply with anti-discrimination law before being awarded a contract. Margaret Thatcher banned this practice when local authorities tried to implement it in the 1980s.

      "body": "<p>A few minutes, hours, or even weeks after experiencing Blast Theory's Desert Rain you could be rooting through your bag or pocket when you suddenly discover something you didn't know you had. It is a small plastic box that contains 100,000 grains of sand.</p> <p>One hundred thousand is the figure some put on the number of Iraqi casualties in the Gulf war. Others claim 1m, while some argue that only a few hundred died, maybe fewer. When, after the war, General Colin Powell was questioned about the number of Iraqi dead, he replied: \"It's really not a number I'm terribly interested in.\"</p> <p>The tiny, densely packed box in which every grain represents a life suddenly makes you interested. Turning it over in my hand, I thought of Lady Macbeth's belated sense of horror at her own deeds: \"Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?\"</p> <p>There is an irony in the fact that the Gulf war was the most reported conflict in history, yet nobody knows how many died. Blast Theory plays cleverly on this in Desert Rain, an event that is part performance, part installation and part computer game.</p> <p>Blast Theory is the company that attracted admiration and approbation in 1998 for their project Kidnap. For this, members of the public paid \u00a310 to enter a lottery, the winners of which would be put under surveillance, kidnapped and held in a secret location for 48 hours. Two entrants were duly seized, and video footage of their captivity was broadcast on the internet.While some criticised this blurring of the lines between crime and art, the project raised questions about the way media coverage of an event affects our perception of it. A typical response of those in the Kidnap internet chatroom was that they wanted the captors to be more horrible to the captives.</p> <p>Desert Rain continues the company's interest in new technologies and the way that major incidents are mediated through 24-hour news coverage. Here, the Gulf war - the first virtual war - comes under the microscope.</p> <p>Blast Theory has found a way of presenting the Gulf war that makes it as accessible to teenage computer freaks as it is to academics. Six at a time, ticket-holders are invited into a briefing room and given human targets to locate. They are then each zipped into a tent-like cubicle, where they enter a virtual world of deserts, bunkers and tunnels projected on to a screen consisting of falling water. Using a foot-operated control panel, they must find their target and the exit within 30 minutes.</p> <p>Unlike most computer games, the software used in Desert Rain allows the players to talk to and help each other. What's more, the boundaries between real space and virtual reality become confused. Is the figure looming at me out of the light real or virtual?</p> <p>Geeks may be disappointed that the graphics don't measure up to Playstation, but the experience does recreate some of the fear and disorientation that those on the ground during the Gulf war must have felt. Anxiety makes you start behaving in ways you would never have predicted.</p> <p>When, with time fast running out, I accidentally locate the exit, I head for it, ignoring the others' cries for help. Afterwards, as we head for the room where we will come face to face with videos of each of our human targets - all turn out to have been real participants in the Gulf war; each has a distinct point of view - I cannot meet the gaze of my team-mates. I feel as if I really have left someone to die in the desert.</p> <p>As with Kidnap, some will question whether Desert Rain is art or merely a prank; just a game or a genuine attempt to harness new technologies to performance.

      "bodyText": "A few minutes, hours, or even weeks after experiencing Blast Theory's Desert Rain you could be rooting through your bag or pocket when you suddenly discover something you didn't know you had. It is a small plastic box that contains 100,000 grains of sand. One hundred thousand is the figure some put on the number of Iraqi casualties in the Gulf war. Others claim 1m, while some argue that only a few hundred died, maybe fewer. When, after the war, General Colin Powell was questioned about the number of Iraqi dead, he replied: \"It's really not a number I'm terribly interested in.\" The tiny, densely packed box in which every grain represents a life suddenly makes you interested. Turning it over in my hand, I thought of Lady Macbeth's belated sense of horror at her own deeds: \"Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?\" There is an irony in the fact that the Gulf war was the most reported conflict in history, yet nobody knows how many died. Blast Theory plays cleverly on this in Desert Rain, an event that is part performance, part installation and part computer game. Blast Theory is the company that attracted admiration and approbation in 1998 for their project Kidnap. For this, members of the public paid \u00a310 to enter a lottery, the winners of which would be put under surveillance, kidnapped and held in a secret location for 48 hours. Two entrants were duly seized, and video footage of their captivity was broadcast on the internet.While some criticised this blurring of the lines between crime and art, the project raised questions about the way media coverage of an event affects our perception of it. A typical response of those in the Kidnap internet chatroom was that they wanted the captors to be more horrible to the captives. Desert Rain continues the company's interest in new technologies and the way that major incidents are mediated through 24-hour news coverage. Here, the Gulf war - the first virtual war - comes under the microscope. Blast Theory has found a way of presenting the Gulf war that makes it as accessible to teenage computer freaks as it is to academics. Six at a time, ticket-holders are invited into a briefing room and given human targets to locate. They are then each zipped into a tent-like cubicle, where they enter a virtual world of deserts, bunkers and tunnels projected on to a screen consisting of falling water. Using a foot-operated control panel, they must find their target and the exit within 30 minutes. Unlike most computer games, the software used in Desert Rain allows the players to talk to and help each other. What's more, the boundaries between real space and virtual reality become confused. Is the figure looming at me out of the light real or virtual? Geeks may be disappointed that the graphics don't measure up to Playstation, but the experience does recreate some of the fear and disorientation that those on the ground during the Gulf war must have felt. Anxiety makes you start behaving in ways you would never have predicted. When, with time fast running out, I accidentally locate the exit, I head for it, ignoring the others' cries for help. Afterwards, as we head for the room where we will come face to face with videos of each of our human targets - all turn out to have been real participants in the Gulf war; each has a distinct point of view - I cannot meet the gaze of my team-mates. I feel as if I really have left someone to die in the desert. As with Kidnap, some will question whether Desert Rain is art or merely a prank; just a game or a genuine attempt to harness new technologies to performance. What seems certain is that Blast Theory's piece is part of a growing trend in performance and installation to blur the line between spectator and participant. \"One of the things I've always found most exciting about theatre and performance is the way it creates bonds between total strangers,\" says Blast Theory's Matt Adams. \"This project just takes that idea further. There's no real difference between the participants in Desert Rain believing in computer graphics and audiences at the theatre looking at an actor in a tinfoil crown and believing he is a king.\"",

The Home Office insisted that Dame Stella, who was head of the security service between 1992 and 1996, had stuck \"entirely to the rules\" by submitting her manuscript for vetting by Sir Richard Wilson, the cabinet secretary.

However, Whitehall sources also made it clear that while Dame Stella was engaged in what they called \"civilised discussions\"; the fact there were discussions at all meant there were differences of view about the content. It is understood that her manuscript - for which she has yet to find a publisher, according to Whitehall - is partly a personal memoir describing what it was like to be a woman in a man's world.

Mr Shayler, who marked his 1000th day of \"exile\" with a demonstration outside the British embassy in Paris, said he was willing to face Official Secrets Act charges in Britain but only if the courts agreed to the disclosure of documents, including those relating to MI6 knowledge of a plot to kill the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy. Speaking from Rimini, Italy, Mr Tomlinson said: \"It is hyp ocritical that Stella Rimington is allowed to publish a book and yet I am being harassed because of my plans to publish my book.\" He said he had just signed a contract with a Moscow publisher but insisted his work did not include details of his MI6 operations. Downing Street sought to play down the significance of Dame Stella's book, pointing to a 1955 precedent when former MI5 chief Sir Percy Sillitoe published his memoirs and both main opposition parties stayed out of the dispute over publication.

According to the newspapers, he has been \"rattled\" by William Hague's success in the weekly joust, and demanded that civil servants provide him with \"killer facts\" which would make the shaven-headed embryo squirm with anguish and shame.</p> <p>So yesterday we met the new prime minister, Mr Mucho Macho Man. When asked the formula question - what his engagements were for the day - he snarled like a home football fan trapped in the visitors' enclosure. \"This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others,\" he barked. \"You got a problem with that?\"</p> <p>(Naturally he didn't say the last bit. But he sounded as if he should. William Hague can count himself lucky that his ear lobes are still intact.)</p> <p>David Winnick, who doesn't so much ask questions as bleat supportively, inquired about Sierra Leone. It was a toss-up whom the prime minister detested most - the African rebels or the Tory opposition. (I wonder what his name will be if he ever takes up WWF wrestling full time: Grizzly Blair, perhaps.)</p> <p>He was \"very, very proud\" of our boys in Sierra Leone. \"I believe they should be able to perform their task without some of the carping and quibbling from the Conservative party ... a criminal gang, which has visited the most appalling atrocities on innocent civilians.\" (The latter remark referred to the rebels, it turned out, but since the tone of outrage was identical, it was hard to tell.)</p> <p>Rebel leader Mr Hague rose to try out a new technique. He quotes a series of people saying critical things about the government, then asks \"why do you think he said that?\" in an innocent, faux naif tone.</p> <p>But there's nothing faux naif about this Tone. Ole Grizzly Blair wouldn't know what the phrase meant. Instead he quoted the chief constable of North Yorkshire, whose area includes the rebel stronghold of Richmond. Apparently a wave of lawfulness is sweeping the county. \"We are driving crime down, year after year!\" he yelled.</p> <p>Mr Hague tried again, this time quoting former minister Frank Field, the accountants Ernst and Young, various high-ranking policemen and similar riff-raff. Mr Blair glowered at him.</p> <p>\"This week the civil servants have given me some things I would like to tell the house. The system has got better!</p> <p>\"This is what they say: crime doubled under the Tories. Killer fact! Unemployment trebled under the Tories. Killer fact! Thousands of hospital beds closed every day.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair is evidently upset by the leaking of a memo in which he appeared to demand help at question time. According to the newspapers, he has been \"rattled\" by William Hague's success in the weekly joust, and demanded that civil servants provide him with \"killer facts\" which would make the shaven-headed embryo squirm with anguish and shame. So yesterday we met the new prime minister, Mr Mucho Macho Man. When asked the formula question - what his engagements were for the day - he snarled like a home football fan trapped in the visitors' enclosure. \"This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others,\" he barked. \"You got a problem with that?\" (Naturally he didn't say the last bit. But he sounded as if he should. William Hague can count himself lucky that his ear lobes are still intact.) David Winnick, who doesn't so much ask questions as bleat supportively, inquired about Sierra Leone. It was a toss-up whom the prime minister detested most - the African rebels or the Tory opposition. (I wonder what his name will be if he ever takes up WWF wrestling full time: Grizzly Blair, perhaps.) He was \"very, very proud\" of our boys in Sierra Leone. \"I believe they should be able to perform their task without some of the carping and quibbling from the Conservative party ... a criminal gang, which has visited the most appalling atrocities on innocent civilians.\" (The latter remark referred to the rebels, it turned out, but since the tone of outrage was identical, it was hard to tell.) Rebel leader Mr Hague rose to try out a new technique. He quotes a series of people saying critical things about the government, then asks \"why do you think he said that?\" in an innocent, faux naif tone. But there's nothing faux naif about this Tone. Ole Grizzly Blair wouldn't know what the phrase meant. Instead he quoted the chief constable of North Yorkshire, whose area includes the rebel stronghold of Richmond. Apparently a wave of lawfulness is sweeping the county. \"We are driving crime down, year after year!\" he yelled. Mr Hague tried again, this time quoting former minister Frank Field, the accountants Ernst and Young, various high-ranking policemen and similar riff-raff. Mr Blair glowered at him. \"This week the civil servants have given me some things I would like to tell the house. The system has got better! \"This is what they say: crime doubled under the Tories. Killer fact! Unemployment trebled under the Tories. Killer fact! Thousands of hospital beds closed every day. Lethal earthworms the size of Eurostar trains in every school playground ...\" - well, you get the general idea. Nothing would stop him, though the unbiased observer might have noted that most of the killer facts were very well known and pretty tendentious in the first place. As slavish Labour MPs yelled \"More, more!\" he wound up quoting Michael Portillo, whose newfound honesty makes his collected quotes a little treasure chest for Labour MPs. \"'The government is in a strong position when the economy is doing well.' Killer judgment!\" He sank back angrily on to the bench. Moments later my dear old chum Michael Fabricant rose to complain about the BBC's decision not to broadcast live the celebrations of the Queen Mother's 100th birthday. He was, he said, \"disgusted\". But of course before the prime minister could agree with Mickey - in itself an unusual event - one Labour MP bellowed at him: \"At least the Queen Mother doesn't wear a wig.\" Killer fact!",

Improvisation was the name of the game as consumers used credit cards for big transactions but other forms of payment - bread and packets of Gauloises - instead of francs. </p> <p>The innovative means of circumventing a lack of legal tender may have been new to the well-heeled shoppers in the Champs Elys\u00e9es, but what was happening across France has been mirrored in many parts of the world recently as the number of local currencies has proliferated. </p> <p>Some economists believe that far from needing just one currency Europe would actually prosper better with a large number of currencies, and a new report out this week suggested that one of the things Ken Livingstone should consider is a new currency for London. </p> <p>According to a report from the alternative think tank, New Economics Foundation (NEF), London's problem is that it is not one economy but at least three. City workers earn salaries as stratospheric as the skyscrapers they inhabit, but in boroughs within a stone's throw of their offices people survive for a month on what the average bond trader might spend on a good night out. </p> <p>\"The financial services industry may create a trickle down of wealth; it also causes severe distortions,\" says NEF's David Boyle, the author of the report, Why London Needs Its Own Currency. </p> <p>\"It brings executives from all over the world whose employers pay generous housing expenses - forcing the price of London homes well above the rest of the country.\" NEF argues that using just the one currency and a single interest rate means that most people who live in London are disadvantaged. \"London has a wealth of talent and resources but the single international currency we all live on doesn't use those resources efficiently.\" </p> <p>Instead the think tank proposes that each of the capital's three economies - international, local and social - should have its own currency. </p> <p>Local currencies flourish side by side with national currencies elsewhere in the world. One of the oldest is the wir, set up in Switzerland before the war. It has an annual turnover of \u00a312bn and 65,000 corporate members. The wir is a barter system whose members exchange goods and services without using Swiss francs. The advantage of the system is that because the currency stays in the local economy it creates value where it is most needed. It does not matter, either, if people go into debt in wirs - it simply stimulates demand for more goods and services. </p> <p>In fact to make barter systems work, people need to run up overdrafts at times. MIT economist Paul Krugman tells the story of a babysitting circle in Washington which issued pieces of paper equivalent to one hour of babysitting time. When members babysat each other's children they were paid in coupons. The system came unstuck because the number of coupons in circulation was too low: people became reluctant to go out because they did not have enough coupons in reserve to pay for babysitting. Most of the members were lawyers and typically, they tried a legalistic solution, passing a rule requiring each couple to go out at least twice a month. But, in fact says Krugman, the right solution was an injection of liquidity into the system. Eventually they figured it out and issued more coupons which encouraged people to go out more - a mutually beneficial solution. </p> <p>In Britain, local exchange and tradings systems (LETS), have a toehold in many local economies. NEF proposes that a new local currency for London be set up, named the Thames. An interest-free barter currency, it would be of no use to the multinationals but could help reconnect people who are cut off from the cash economy. Local authorities would allow people to pay a proportion of council tax, fines and other charges in Thames. Councils would also spend the Thames they received, either in part payments to contractors and staff, grants to local charities, zero interest loans to small businesses, or some mixture of all three. </p> <p>There is a third economy which also needs its own currency, according to David Boyle. Economists are fond of talking about social capital, but Boyle prefers the term 'social economy', which he defines as \"the crucial human transactions which build families and neighbourhoods, ensure old people are looked after, create the supportive networks we mean when we talk about the 'fabric' of society.\" As such, London would also have a network of time banks, connecting volunteers with people in need. </p> <p>Experience has shown that there are problems with local currencies. Some have lacked critical mass, others have become more popular among the relatively affluent than the poor - still others have struggled to find an effective means of connecting to the wider cash economy. However, two recent trends - the rise of the internet and the widening gap between rich and poor - mean there has never been more interest in alternatives to cash, and not just in Paris.</p>",

The innovative means of circumventing a lack of legal tender may have been new to the well-heeled shoppers in the Champs Elys\u00e9es, but what was happening across France has been mirrored in many parts of the world recently as the number of local currencies has proliferated. Some economists believe that far from needing just one currency Europe would actually prosper better with a large number of currencies, and a new report out this week suggested that one of the things Ken Livingstone should consider is a new currency for London. According to a report from the alternative think tank, New Economics Foundation (NEF), London's problem is that it is not one economy but at least three. City workers earn salaries as stratospheric as the skyscrapers they inhabit, but in boroughs within a stone's throw of their offices people survive for a month on what the average bond trader might spend on a good night out. \"The financial services industry may create a trickle down of wealth; it also causes severe distortions,\" says NEF's David Boyle, the author of the report, Why London Needs Its Own Currency. \"It brings executives from all over the world whose employers pay generous housing expenses - forcing the price of London homes well above the rest of the country.\" NEF argues that using just the one currency and a single interest rate means that most people who live in London are disadvantaged. \"London has a wealth of talent and resources but the single international currency we all live on doesn't use those resources efficiently.\" Instead the think tank proposes that each of the capital's three economies - international, local and social - should have its own currency. Local currencies flourish side by side with national currencies elsewhere in the world. One of the oldest is the wir, set up in Switzerland before the war. It has an annual turnover of \u00a312bn and 65,000 corporate members. The wir is a barter system whose members exchange goods and services without using Swiss francs. The advantage of the system is that because the currency stays in the local economy it creates value where it is most needed. It does not matter, either, if people go into debt in wirs - it simply stimulates demand for more goods and services. In fact to make barter systems work, people need to run up overdrafts at times. MIT economist Paul Krugman tells the story of a babysitting circle in Washington which issued pieces of paper equivalent to one hour of babysitting time. When members babysat each other's children they were paid in coupons. The system came unstuck because the number of coupons in circulation was too low: people became reluctant to go out because they did not have enough coupons in reserve to pay for babysitting. Most of the members were lawyers and typically, they tried a legalistic solution, passing a rule requiring each couple to go out at least twice a month. But, in fact says Krugman, the right solution was an injection of liquidity into the system. Eventually they figured it out and issued more coupons which encouraged people to go out more - a mutually beneficial solution. In Britain, local exchange and tradings systems (LETS), have a toehold in many local economies. NEF proposes that a new local currency for London be set up, named the Thames. An interest-free barter currency, it would be of no use to the multinationals but could help reconnect people who are cut off from the cash economy. Local authorities would allow people to pay a proportion of council tax, fines and other charges in Thames. Councils would also spend the Thames they received, either in part payments to contractors and staff, grants to local charities, zero interest loans to small businesses, or some mixture of all three. There is a third economy which also needs its own currency, according to David Boyle. Economists are fond of talking about social capital, but Boyle prefers the term 'social economy', which he defines as \"the crucial human transactions which build families and neighbourhoods, ensure old people are looked after, create the supportive networks we mean when we talk about the 'fabric' of society.\" As such, London would also have a network of time banks, connecting volunteers with people in need. Experience has shown that there are problems with local currencies. Some have lacked critical mass, others have become more popular among the relatively affluent than the poor - still others have struggled to find an effective means of connecting to the wider cash economy. However, two recent trends - the rise of the internet and the widening gap between rich and poor - mean there has never been more interest in alternatives to cash, and not just in Paris.",

      "body": "<p>UK-based mobile phones group Vodafone and its French media partner, Vivendi, set out ambitious plans yesterday to rival leading American brands such as Yahoo! and AOL with their new multiple-access internet portal, Vizzavi, and bring it to the market within two years. </p> <p>Revealing the plans to make Vizzavi Europe's top portal at a glitzy launch in Paris, Vivendi's chairman, Jean-Marie Messier, said the aim was to make it \"the internet in the palm of your hand\", and take away the fear of web-based technology from consumers. </p> <p>But Evan Newmark, the American chief executive of Vizzavi, to be based in London, warned that the new unit had \"12 to 18 months at most\" to establish itself as Europe's portal of choice. Even so, Mr Newmark insisted a listing could come in two years. \"We want Vizzavi to have its own people, own currency and own culture,\" he said at the launch, which took place six weeks ahead of schedule and will see the portal available in France next month, the UK in July and Germany and Italy by the end of the year. </p> <p>Mr Messier used the launch to disclose that Vodafone has agreed to sell a 15% stake in Cegetel, the private French telecoms operator, to Vivendi. </p> <p>Cegetel's SFR mobile phone business alone is worth an estimated \u00a330bn, enabling Vodafone to recoup virtually the entire cost of its successful bid for a UK third generation mobile phone licence at the recent auction, according to company sources. </p> <p>Vivendi will then offer in turn half of that stake to other Cegetel shareholders, preferably BT. \"This will be an opportunity for BT to strengthen its position in Cegetel as part of our partnership,\" he said of a pending deal that will give him majority (51.5%) control. </p> <p>Vodafone is handing on to Vivendi the Cegetel stake that it took over when it acquired Mannesmann, the German telephony group. Mannesmann's fate as an independent company was scuppered when Mr Messier spurned its advances - and in secret talks with Chris Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, agreed to combine with the UK group and launch what is now Vizzavi. </p> <p>The new portal, which acts as both an internet search engine and provider of services such as email, already has via its parent companies a customer base of 70m in Europe and will take over the existing portals offered by units such as D2 in Germany. </p> <p>It is expected to gain lift-off, according to Mr Newmark, with the growth of the market for new generation mobile phones offering faster data transmission. But this would not occur until the middle of next year. </p> <p>Vizzavi, extolled by Mr Messier as \"my friendly twin\" through offering a highly personalised service to consumers, will also be available via the Pay-TV service supplied by Canal Plus, a Vivendi subsidiary. </p> <p>Ultimately, Mr Newmark said, it would be reached via personal computers. The 50:50 joint venture will see its parents retain 100% of their access revenues while web-based service and content providers will gain 50%. This arrangement will be reviewed in two years, prior to the listing. </p> <p>\"I have no doubt that this will be a Europe-leading and world-leading portal,\" Mr Gent said. Vivendi suffered a serious blow yesterday, however, when it pulled out of the German auction for third generation mobile phone licences, with Mr Messier arguing that the bidding rules penalised new entrants.</p>",

      "bodyText": "UK-based mobile phones group Vodafone and its French media partner, Vivendi, set out ambitious plans yesterday to rival leading American brands such as Yahoo! and AOL with their new multiple-access internet portal, Vizzavi, and bring it to the market within two years. Revealing the plans to make Vizzavi Europe's top portal at a glitzy launch in Paris, Vivendi's chairman, Jean-Marie Messier, said the aim was to make it \"the internet in the palm of your hand\", and take away the fear of web-based technology from consumers. But Evan Newmark, the American chief executive of Vizzavi, to be based in London, warned that the new unit had \"12 to 18 months at most\" to establish itself as Europe's portal of choice. Even so, Mr Newmark insisted a listing could come in two years. \"We want Vizzavi to have its own people, own currency and own culture,\" he said at the launch, which took place six weeks ahead of schedule and will see the portal available in France next month, the UK in July and Germany and Italy by the end of the year. Mr Messier used the launch to disclose that Vodafone has agreed to sell a 15% stake in Cegetel, the private French telecoms operator, to Vivendi. Cegetel's SFR mobile phone business alone is worth an estimated \u00a330bn, enabling Vodafone to recoup virtually the entire cost of its successful bid for a UK third generation mobile phone licence at the recent auction, according to company sources. Vivendi will then offer in turn half of that stake to other Cegetel shareholders, preferably BT. \"This will be an opportunity for BT to strengthen its position in Cegetel as part of our partnership,\" he said of a pending deal that will give him majority (51.5%) control. Vodafone is handing on to Vivendi the Cegetel stake that it took over when it acquired Mannesmann, the German telephony group. Mannesmann's fate as an independent company was scuppered when Mr Messier spurned its advances - and in secret talks with Chris Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, agreed to combine with the UK group and launch what is now Vizzavi. The new portal, which acts as both an internet search engine and provider of services such as email, already has via its parent companies a customer base of 70m in Europe and will take over the existing portals offered by units such as D2 in Germany. It is expected to gain lift-off, according to Mr Newmark, with the growth of the market for new generation mobile phones offering faster data transmission. But this would not occur until the middle of next year. Vizzavi, extolled by Mr Messier as \"my friendly twin\" through offering a highly personalised service to consumers, will also be available via the Pay-TV service supplied by Canal Plus, a Vivendi subsidiary. Ultimately, Mr Newmark said, it would be reached via personal computers. The 50:50 joint venture will see its parents retain 100% of their access revenues while web-based service and content providers will gain 50%. This arrangement will be reviewed in two years, prior to the listing. \"I have no doubt that this will be a Europe-leading and world-leading portal,\" Mr Gent said. Vivendi suffered a serious blow yesterday, however, when it pulled out of the German auction for third generation mobile phone licences, with Mr Messier arguing that the bidding rules penalised new entrants.",

If the bookmakers have got it right, there will be a puff of white smoke at the Science Museum on Tuesday night and a 2-1 favourite will emerge garlanded with the \u00a310,000 Aventis science book prize. But first, a brief history of the science book prize. It began as the Copus-Science Museum science book prize (Copus being the acronym for the Committee for the Public Understanding of Science).Then it became the Rhone-Poulenc science book prize . This year it carries the name of another French team, Aventis , the pharmaceuticals and agrochemical group headquartered in Strasbourg, and the Institut de France. Aventis is the child of a merger between Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, so there is continuity in this narrative of 100 or so books annually in pursuit of big money and demure publicity. </p> <p><strong> And now, gentle reader... </strong><br> Naughton's book is subtitled The Origins Of The Internet. Science books mercifully come with tersely informative subtitles. The White Death, by Thomas Dormandy Hambledon Press), second favourite at 3-1, is subtitled A History Of Tuberculosis. Genome, by Matt Ridley (Fourth Estate) third favourite at 4-1, is subtitled The Autobiography Of A Species In 23 Chapters. Time, Love And Memory: A Great Biologist And His Quest For The Origins Of Behaviour, by Jonathan Weiner (Faber) is at 5-1, along with two others. These are Children Of Prometheus: The Accelerating Pace Of Human Evolution, by Christopher Wills (Allen lane) and The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions And The Quest For The Ultimate Theory, by Bryan Greene (Vintage). </p> <p><strong> From Turner to page turner </strong><br> Graham Sharpe of William Hill Associates each year tries to second-guess the judges.

If the bookmakers have got it right, there will be a puff of white smoke at the Science Museum on Tuesday night and a 2-1 favourite will emerge garlanded with the \u00a310,000 Aventis science book prize. But first, a brief history of the science book prize. It began as the Copus-Science Museum science book prize (Copus being the acronym for the Committee for the Public Understanding of Science).Then it became the Rhone-Poulenc science book prize . This year it carries the name of another French team, Aventis , the pharmaceuticals and agrochemical group headquartered in Strasbourg, and the Institut de France. Aventis is the child of a merger between Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, so there is continuity in this narrative of 100 or so books annually in pursuit of big money and demure publicity. And now, gentle reader... Naughton's book is subtitled The Origins Of The Internet. Science books mercifully come with tersely informative subtitles. The White Death, by Thomas Dormandy Hambledon Press), second favourite at 3-1, is subtitled A History Of Tuberculosis. Genome, by Matt Ridley (Fourth Estate) third favourite at 4-1, is subtitled The Autobiography Of A Species In 23 Chapters. Time, Love And Memory: A Great Biologist And His Quest For The Origins Of Behaviour, by Jonathan Weiner (Faber) is at 5-1, along with two others. These are Children Of Prometheus: The Accelerating Pace Of Human Evolution, by Christopher Wills (Allen lane) and The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions And The Quest For The Ultimate Theory, by Bryan Greene (Vintage). From Turner to page turner Graham Sharpe of William Hill Associates each year tries to second-guess the judges. He has a matter- of-fact take on the sponsorship history of the prize. \"As far as the author is concerned, someone is going to give him 10 grand and I don't suppose he is too worried where he gets it from.We talk about the literary merits and scientific merits of book prizes, but the people who put the money up expect to get a PR return, don't they?\" Book prizes are good business for bookmakers, he says: the Booker in a good year could attract \u00a350,000 in betting money.

      "body": "<p>In the 19th century the poet and critic Charles Baudelaire defined the modern artist as a dandy - an observer of city life who does not judge but watches, ironically. Modern art has thrown up some fine dandies, but Britain has produced just one with the right mix of humour and gravity: Richard Hamilton, the father of British pop art. </p> <p>If there is one British work of art from the 20th century that is guaranteed to last through the 21st, it is the tiny collage that Hamilton made as a poster for the exhibition This Is Tomorrow, held at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1956. The picture is called Just What Is It That Makes Today's Homes So Different, So Appealing? and in it he uses traditional perspective to give coherence to a chaotic collection of consumer products, from a Hoover to a lollipop. It was, he tells me, \"my personal manifesto\". It is a defining image of modern art, marking the moment when modern art stopped being about avant-garde opposition and moved into another, apparently less critical gear. It was the birth of pop. Yet if Hamilton is a dandy, his art is nothing if not critical.</p> <p>In 1957 Hamilton made what he regards as his first mature painting, Hommage \u00e0 Chrysler Corp. It is about cars. Andy Warhol described pop artists as paying attention to \"all the great modern things\". As Hamilton drives his huge Audi and talks, you see and feel this. The modern world we live in, the world of stuff, was new when Hamilton fell in love with it. He was born in 1922 and, along with the other members of the Independent Group who met at the ICA in the 50s, saw American consumer capitalism from the vantage point of austerity Britain. \"You look at everything. You look at the world as it interests you and the world that interested me was cinema, cars - this was in the 50s when their design was very spectacular.\"</p> <p>Hamilton's house is up a lane past a picturesque pond and an orchard in a dreamily English landscape. But it has a barn full of computers, including the one he designed himself and has exhibited as an artwork.</p> <p>Hamilton is an artist fascinated by modernity. Perhaps that is why of all living British artists he is the one whose work gets the richest showing in the opening displays at Tate Modern. His three Northern Ireland paintings, The Citizen, The Subject and The State, are shown together for the first time, and his print of the Guggenheim Museum - the modern museum as pop artifact - comments wittily on the museum itself. Perhaps his strangest work at Tate Modern is Marcel Duchamp's The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even (1915-23) - or rather, the reproduction that Hamilton made of it in 1966, and that Duchamp signed.</p> <p>Think about this. Hamilton was a famous artist by the mid-60s, one of the most brilliant exponents of pop art. He was and is the only British pop artist you could exhibit in a room with Andy Warhol without embarrassment. Yet at the height of his fame he spent two years making a work of art by someone else. This was on top of the time he had already dedicated to producing a typed text of Duchamp's Green Box, a collection of handwritten notes on The Bride Stripped Bare.</p> <p>\"Something like eight years of my life has gone into Marcel Duchamp but I do find him tremendously rewarding,\" says Hamilton, sitting in a white-walled interior that contains more of his reproductions of parts of Duchamp's Large Glass. \"The more I knew about him, the more I felt that this man had tried to reinvent art and to do it in a very purposeful way. Suppose there wasn't a thing called art, what would art be like?\"</p> <p>Artists make careers by having individual styles, by telling a story of self-expression; that's what the market and media like. Yet Hamilton has made artworks in a protean succession of styles and formats. His paintings do not make you ask about his inner life, do not feel like an autobiography. \"I disdain to accept the idea that art is about style,\" he says. \"Francis Bacon had a style of painting; you can say that Lucian Freud has a style of painting and Matisse has a style of painting. Style never seems to me very interesting. Style should be appropriate to the subject, rather than the reverse. I've been willing to almost plagiarise; I take anything that I find interesting. I don't think that is illegitimate. Picasso's a master plagiarist.\"</p> <p>Hamilton's paintings and prints are images, artifacts. You can't tell if he's being emotional or mocking - though he denies that his art is \"ironic\". When the Beatles asked him to design a cover for their 1968 album he came up with a blank white cover. This is a joky idea of the ultimate album cover - topping Peter Blake's Sgt Pepper. \"There's no reason why art shouldn't be amusing. I like the idea of there being a certain hilarity possible in art.\"</p> <p>Hamilton is fascinated, almost as an outsider, by what it is that has made some of his paintings \"icons\". What is really going on in his 1969 painting Swingeing London, the famous image of Mick Jagger and art dealer Robert Fraser in the back of a police van after being arrested on drugs charges? It looks like Jagger is holding his hand up to hide his face but Hamilton tells me Jagger just wanted people to see the cuffs and later \"danced\" to show them off. Swingeing London is an image Hamilton selected, painted and put permanently in the public domain; he was motivated by anger that his friend Fraser - his own dealer - was \"destroyed\" by this prison sentence. \"We made an exhibition in his empty gallery,\" he says. \"I was very despondent at this empty space with the gallery girl sitting there looking rather morose.\"</p> <p>Hamilton made a collage of news accounts of the Rolling Stones drugs trial - \"a meal would be described that was sent to Mick Jagger in jail and each time there was a different menu\" - and then turned one of the pictures into a series of paintings. When you paint a media image or turn it into a fine art print, Hamilton says, something strange happens. He has done it with images of a student shot at the Kent State demonstrations, with a sheet of photographs on which Marilyn Monroe crossed out images of herself she didn't want made public, and with his paintings of an IRA dirty protester, an Orangeman and a soldier in Northern Ireland. With the Kent State print he remembers photographing news images off the television: \"They were amateur films, taken under tension; it was grainy, and there was that feeling of movement and desperation.\" He was worried about using the student's image but realised, \"It's a subject that should be seen and sealed in the memory of people.\"</p> <p>How does an artist turn an event into an iconic image of its time? \"I think it's something to do with the... I'm hesitating because I'm trying to avoid the word beauty.\"</p> <p>Hamilton painted The Citizen (1981-83) after seeing a TV documentary about Republican prisoners' \"dirty protest\" at conditions in the Maze. It portrays a protester as a Christ-like, cloaked figure surrounded by sensuous, decorative swirls of his own excrement. Today Hamilton insists this is not a piece of myth-making but an analysis of myth. He wanted to show how the IRA prisoners systematically created an image of themselves as martyrs. \"They lived in excrement and wore blankets and refused to have their hair cut and they created this image. They liked to have a little cross hanging around their necks too.\"</p> <p>In his subsequent paintings The Subject and The State he focuses on this same process of people's self-representation: the Ulsterman's orange sash, the British soldier's camouflage. Why, he wonders, did British soldiers on patrol in urban Belfast need to wear rustic camouflage? It was, in an inversion of its supposed purpose, meant to be seen. Yet the three isolated figures in these paintings are set against a background of blur and uncertainty - an empty country road, a night-time street, a room covered with shit.</p> <p>The brown-painted prison cell appears again, blasphemously, in the painting Hamilton is now making for the National Gallery. He is one of the eminent artists invited by the gallery to create a new work in response to a painting in its collection. The exhibition, Encounters, opens next month. He takes me to his studio, where he is painting a modern equivalent of a picture of a church interior by the Dutch master Pieter Saenredam. Hamilton is a political artist, and although he talks about this picture in terms of perspective and form, the resulting painting is nicely satirical. Where Saenredam depicted churches, Hamilton has done a perspective painting of the Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery, emptied of crowds, transformed into a sublime abstract space - a modern cathedral.</p> <p>Yet in this space are Duchampian allusions to the realities that high art is supposed to ignore. A naked woman emerges from behind a pillar. At the vanishing point of the painting, where in the real gallery you would find a medieval painting of Christ, Hamilton has hung a miniature version of his dung-decorated Citizen, a kind of anti-Christ. The face, people have told him, looks evil.</p> <p>Richard Hamilton is simultaneously a great lover of modern things and someone who can stand back from contemporary life, like Warhol, and make disconcertingly objective pictures of it. His favourite term of denunciation is \"stupid\". His pictures isolate the images that surround us, analyse them, and place them in history. In the future we will be able to look at them and see 20th-century Britain as sharply as you can see 19th-century Paris in the art of Manet. The cars, the toasters and the prisoners.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In 2058, we will blast-off to colonise Mars. Or we may enter symbiosis with machines - or find a trick that enables us to tame previously uninhabitable regions of the earth. But something extraordinary is going to happen 58 years from now. How do we know? It's written in the Dow Jones Index. </p> <p>Didier Sornette, a geophysicist who splits his time between the universities of California, Los Angeles and Nice, specialises in analysing the complex signals that warn of earthquakes or impending crashes in financial markets. </p> <p>But he recently took a casual look at the variations of the Dow Jones Index, a measure of the prosperity of the world's most profitable companies. From an extrapolation of its past patterns, Sornette came up with a graph showing that the index's value would climb - with some small fluctuations - into the future. His specific predictions of its value, he noted happily, agree with those of US Federal Reserve economists and senior market analysts. </p> <p>But according to his model, the index's value will abruptly explode in 2058: for no apparent reason the graph suddenly shoots off the scale. </p> <p>Surprised, Sornette had a look at another fluctuating signal: world population statistics. This too, he found, had a shape signalling an abrupt population explosion at a specific point in the future: 2058, to be precise. Sornette's analysis was based on more than 100 years of the Dow Jones Index, and 2,000 years of available world population data, yet both sets of figures forecasted a singularity for the same year. \"That,\" he says, \"was scary.\" </p> <p>In 2058, Sornette says, these two factors will hit a massive acceleration in their rate of growth that will take them to a \"spontaneous singularity\". This is a point where the graphs can't get any steeper. Singularities foreshadow a critical point of fundamental and abrupt disruption to the status quo. Black holes in space are one example. Others include stock market crashes, earthquakes, and catastrophic ruptures in engineering structures. </p> <p>According to cosmologists, a singularity kicked our universe into existence. </p> <p>With the world's population and economy hitting a critical point at the same time, the survival of humanity will depend on developing a new way of living on (or maybe off) the earth, Sornette says. </p> <p>After all, he points out, the two signals are inextricably linked. World population growth must somehow be related to the ability to provide food and habitable conditions for that population. And that requires innovation. </p> <p>Each of mankind's innovations - fire, tools, agriculture, fossil fuels, vaccines, pesticides and antibiotics - has increased the number of people that can exist on the planet. The technology-led internet is the latest revolution, Sornette says, following the industrial and biotechnological revolutions. But he points out that biotech had hardly begun to fulfil its potential before the internet was born: innovation is accelerating out of control. And that will lead to the singularity. </p> <p>Hence the search for a \"different way\" - planetary colonisation, or maybe the development of human-machines? Biologists have even proposed to Sornette that it could be a fundamental mutation in the human genes. \"These things have all been suggested by scientists, philosophers and writers; what's fascinating is that we can see it coming in the data,\" Sornette says. </p> <p>There are a couple of caveats about the date. The Dow Jones Index is not an ideal measure of innovation, although Sornette believes it is still the best available indication. </p> <p>Also, he adds, it's only numbers. \"Maths is just a language to formalise what we see around us.\" In reality, things don't always turn out as sharply as the figures suggest. So blast-off for Mars may not come in precisely 2058; it could come sooner or much later. But whatever the timing, Sornette says, mankind is definitely heading towards some kind of new era. </p> <p>Pessimists will think of it as a catastrophic meltdown, where innovation rates can't sustain the population explosion. Optimists believe some as yet unknown revolution will ease our way. But the optimists have a problem: any further innovation simply accelerates doomsday's arrival. </p> <p>It's probably best not to get too worked up, though. With one thing and another, the end has been nigh for a very long time now.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 2058, we will blast-off to colonise Mars. Or we may enter symbiosis with machines - or find a trick that enables us to tame previously uninhabitable regions of the earth. But something extraordinary is going to happen 58 years from now. How do we know? It's written in the Dow Jones Index. Didier Sornette, a geophysicist who splits his time between the universities of California, Los Angeles and Nice, specialises in analysing the complex signals that warn of earthquakes or impending crashes in financial markets. But he recently took a casual look at the variations of the Dow Jones Index, a measure of the prosperity of the world's most profitable companies. From an extrapolation of its past patterns, Sornette came up with a graph showing that the index's value would climb - with some small fluctuations - into the future. His specific predictions of its value, he noted happily, agree with those of US Federal Reserve economists and senior market analysts. But according to his model, the index's value will abruptly explode in 2058: for no apparent reason the graph suddenly shoots off the scale. Surprised, Sornette had a look at another fluctuating signal: world population statistics. This too, he found, had a shape signalling an abrupt population explosion at a specific point in the future: 2058, to be precise. Sornette's analysis was based on more than 100 years of the Dow Jones Index, and 2,000 years of available world population data, yet both sets of figures forecasted a singularity for the same year. \"That,\" he says, \"was scary.\" In 2058, Sornette says, these two factors will hit a massive acceleration in their rate of growth that will take them to a \"spontaneous singularity\". This is a point where the graphs can't get any steeper. Singularities foreshadow a critical point of fundamental and abrupt disruption to the status quo. Black holes in space are one example. Others include stock market crashes, earthquakes, and catastrophic ruptures in engineering structures. According to cosmologists, a singularity kicked our universe into existence. With the world's population and economy hitting a critical point at the same time, the survival of humanity will depend on developing a new way of living on (or maybe off) the earth, Sornette says. After all, he points out, the two signals are inextricably linked. World population growth must somehow be related to the ability to provide food and habitable conditions for that population. And that requires innovation. Each of mankind's innovations - fire, tools, agriculture, fossil fuels, vaccines, pesticides and antibiotics - has increased the number of people that can exist on the planet. The technology-led internet is the latest revolution, Sornette says, following the industrial and biotechnological revolutions. But he points out that biotech had hardly begun to fulfil its potential before the internet was born: innovation is accelerating out of control. And that will lead to the singularity. Hence the search for a \"different way\" - planetary colonisation, or maybe the development of human-machines? Biologists have even proposed to Sornette that it could be a fundamental mutation in the human genes. \"These things have all been suggested by scientists, philosophers and writers; what's fascinating is that we can see it coming in the data,\" Sornette says. There are a couple of caveats about the date. The Dow Jones Index is not an ideal measure of innovation, although Sornette believes it is still the best available indication. Also, he adds, it's only numbers. \"Maths is just a language to formalise what we see around us.\" In reality, things don't always turn out as sharply as the figures suggest. So blast-off for Mars may not come in precisely 2058; it could come sooner or much later. But whatever the timing, Sornette says, mankind is definitely heading towards some kind of new era. Pessimists will think of it as a catastrophic meltdown, where innovation rates can't sustain the population explosion. Optimists believe some as yet unknown revolution will ease our way. But the optimists have a problem: any further innovation simply accelerates doomsday's arrival. It's probably best not to get too worked up, though. With one thing and another, the end has been nigh for a very long time now.",

These are imprinted: either the mother's or father's copy is shut down. It's a battle of the sexes that begins at conception for the father wants the foetus to grow large, while the mother doesn't want the foetus to be too big to pass through the birth canal or to drain too much energy from her. </p> <p>Genetic imprinting is thought to be involved in muscle growth, as well as brain development and sexual orientation. Homosexuality and transsexuality could be due to imprinting defects according to Dr Richard Green, from the department of psychiatry at Charing Cross Hospital, London, who worked with Barry Keverne from the department of animal behaviour at Cambridge University. </p> <p>The hypothesis is that male to female transsexuals inherit one or more imprinted genes from their mother which have a feminising effect. </p> <p>But back to the platypus: Dr Jirtle and his colleague Dr Keith Killian chose to look at this beast because they thought there should be no sex wars among the platypuses. By a bizarre twist of fate, they are monotremes: they look like mammals but lay eggs. Opossums, the other animal he and his team examined, are marsupials and have a refreshingly short pregnancy which lasts 13 days. </p> <p>The foetus is then nursed in the mother's pouch. Jirtle's theory was that neither marsupials nor monotremes should have imprinted genes because there was no need for the sexes to battle for resources if the foetus grows in either an egg or a pouch. However, what he and his colleagues discovered was that opossums but not platypuses do have imprinted genes. The imprinted gene from the father causes the young opossums to develop rapidly. This supports the idea that imprinting is the result of a sexual battle, says Jirtle. </p> <p>\"Young opossum must crawl to reach the pouch and latch on, and this is consistent with a battle of the sexes for nutrient allocation as a reason for imprinted genes. For the opossum, it's literally a race for life.\" </p> <p>Once newborn opossums latch on to the mother's nipple, the nipple swells and the babies are stuck there for months until their mouths become big enough to open. Since there are only a dozen nipples and up to 50 babies in a single litter, competition is high. The faster a baby opossum can climb, the more likely it is to survive, and the more likely its genes will be passed on. On the other hand, each platypus has an egg to itself, and once the eggs hatch, there's enough to go round: the mother platypus lacks nipples and milk oozes freely from patches on her chest. There are about 30 known imprinted genes, but according to Jirtle, there could be as many as 500. </p> <p>\"We don't know if humans need these imprinted genes, or if we would be okay without them,\" Jirtle says, \"Although this battle of the sexes occurred about 150 million years ago, it's like keeping stuff in the freezer - you jam it in and leave it there even if it's no longer useful. Nevertheless, we have imprinted genes and they are targets for developmental diseases and cancer.\" </p> <p>We have only one copy of each imprinted gene because one parental copy is suppressed. If this remaining copy mutates, or is damaged there's no handy back-up. </p> <p>\"A single mutation in a gene for growth can cause cells to develop abnormally and become cancerous. The imprinted gene in the opossum has the cumbersome title of M6P/IGF2 receptor. This gene exists in humans too, and is a tumour suppressor, but is not imprinted. However, even though we have two copies of the gene, it is still implicated in the early stages of cancer: at least one copy of this gene doesn't work in more than 60% of liver cancers, 30% of breast cancers and 50% of lung cancers. Like the opossum, and unlike us, mice do have an imprinted copy of the growth gene. </p> <p>\"It's a funny gene,\" says Jirtle. \"It's the only gene presently known that is imprinted in mice, but not humans.\" </p> <p>Jirtle's next plan is to try and develop a mouse that has two copies of the gene. This would make genetically modified mice more similar to humans in their response to carcinogenic agents and thus would be better models to use in cancer research. Ultimately once he and other researchers in the field understand the molecular genetics behind imprinting, they may be able to help treat not only cancer, but a whole range of other disorders. Angelman syndrome, for instance, is a disease caused by the mutation of a maternal expressed imprinted gene which results in retardation, insomnia, seizures and hyperactivity. </p> <p>Jirtle also believes that the research so far can help us retrace our evolutionary origins. The presence of imprinted genes in the opossum but not platypus suggests that marsupials are more closely related to eutherians - mammals whose offspring develop in the womb - than they are to the egg-laying monotremes. According to his research, the platypus evolved earlier than the opossum. </p> <p>\"When did the imprinting of this gene start and end?\" asks Jirtle. \"I want the whole family tree known for this gene.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Approach your penguin with care. Better still, don't approach it at all. If it is sitting there, stock still in the snow, it is incubating an egg. If you get within 15 feet, says Melissa Giese of the Australian Antarctic Division, it will get off the egg. </p> <p> That puts the embryo chick at risk. But that isn't all. As you approach a penguin its heartbeat goes up massively. This, too, is a problem for the poor bird, says Dr Giese. It may have to sit on the egg for weeks while its mate is away foraging. Penguins have a tight energy budget. Too many episodes of a heart rate poised for fight or flight and the bird may not be able to sit out its vigil. It may have to get up and go looking for food, and that means goodbye progeny for another year. </p> <p>Dr Giese, on duty at the Great Australian Science Show in Melbourne this month, is the author of guidelines for tourist operators working in Antarctica. They sure need guidelines, she says. Tourism is growing at 600% per season, as cruise ships gather around the south polar summer shorelines. \"Most people who go want to get nice and close to the animals,\" she says. \"They can suffer quite dramatic behavioural and physiological reactions to humans. Their incubation behaviour will be interrupted. </p> <p>\"A penguin under normal circumstances will just be sitting there, minding its own business guarding its eggs, and if it is approached too closely by humans it will stand up and expose the egg to ambient air temperatures.\" </p> <p>She observed Ad\u00e9lie penguin behaviour. Using a dummy egg which picks up their heart rate, she organised systematic approaches to observe what penguins did. The hearts of Pygoscelis adeliae beat at human speeds: 90 beats a minute to keep up warmth in a cold climate. If approached, the rate rose 54%. \"They are in the colony for anything up to 30 days without being able to go back to sea and forage so they are relying totally on energy reserves built up before they came ashore, and the energy balance is pretty fine, so any increase in heart rate causes an increase in energy consumption.\" </p> <p>Tourism could be managed in a way that protected the birds. That is not happening, she says. \"The industry is experiencing incredible growth, it is uncontrolled in terms of the numbers of operators, the numbers of tourists and the numbers of sites the tourists can go to. It is unpoliced. If they don't want to stick to the guidelines there is nobody there to watch them.\" </p> <p>There are serious hazards from pollution, she says. \"It's only a matter of time before there is a major oil spill in Antarctica,\" she says \"and how we would deal with that, I could not begin to imagine. There is also the potential for the tourists to introduce and spread exotic diseases. If it ever did occur, the effect would be catastrophic. A lot of the tour vessels go to one penguin colony and then three hours later they will be landing at another colony. If they were introducing non-indigenous pathogens, there is a great potential for them to be transporting those from penguin colony to penguin colony.\" </p> <p>Antarctica is huge, but most of it is high and icebound. Living things cling precariously to little rocky outcrops and to the ice shelves. Survival is on a knife-edge . Some tour operators are doing a good job. </p> <p>\"But some are pretty lousy, allowing people to go close to wild life, and turning a blind eye to people who collect bits and pieces, artefacts or penguin eggs or whatever.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Approach your penguin with care. Better still, don't approach it at all. If it is sitting there, stock still in the snow, it is incubating an egg. If you get within 15 feet, says Melissa Giese of the Australian Antarctic Division, it will get off the egg. That puts the embryo chick at risk. But that isn't all. As you approach a penguin its heartbeat goes up massively. This, too, is a problem for the poor bird, says Dr Giese. It may have to sit on the egg for weeks while its mate is away foraging. Penguins have a tight energy budget. Too many episodes of a heart rate poised for fight or flight and the bird may not be able to sit out its vigil. It may have to get up and go looking for food, and that means goodbye progeny for another year. Dr Giese, on duty at the Great Australian Science Show in Melbourne this month, is the author of guidelines for tourist operators working in Antarctica. They sure need guidelines, she says. Tourism is growing at 600% per season, as cruise ships gather around the south polar summer shorelines. \"Most people who go want to get nice and close to the animals,\" she says. \"They can suffer quite dramatic behavioural and physiological reactions to humans. Their incubation behaviour will be interrupted. \"A penguin under normal circumstances will just be sitting there, minding its own business guarding its eggs, and if it is approached too closely by humans it will stand up and expose the egg to ambient air temperatures.\" She observed Ad\u00e9lie penguin behaviour. Using a dummy egg which picks up their heart rate, she organised systematic approaches to observe what penguins did. The hearts of Pygoscelis adeliae beat at human speeds: 90 beats a minute to keep up warmth in a cold climate. If approached, the rate rose 54%. \"They are in the colony for anything up to 30 days without being able to go back to sea and forage so they are relying totally on energy reserves built up before they came ashore, and the energy balance is pretty fine, so any increase in heart rate causes an increase in energy consumption.\" Tourism could be managed in a way that protected the birds. That is not happening, she says. \"The industry is experiencing incredible growth, it is uncontrolled in terms of the numbers of operators, the numbers of tourists and the numbers of sites the tourists can go to. It is unpoliced. If they don't want to stick to the guidelines there is nobody there to watch them.\" There are serious hazards from pollution, she says. \"It's only a matter of time before there is a major oil spill in Antarctica,\" she says \"and how we would deal with that, I could not begin to imagine. There is also the potential for the tourists to introduce and spread exotic diseases. If it ever did occur, the effect would be catastrophic. A lot of the tour vessels go to one penguin colony and then three hours later they will be landing at another colony. If they were introducing non-indigenous pathogens, there is a great potential for them to be transporting those from penguin colony to penguin colony.\" Antarctica is huge, but most of it is high and icebound. Living things cling precariously to little rocky outcrops and to the ice shelves. Survival is on a knife-edge . Some tour operators are doing a good job. \"But some are pretty lousy, allowing people to go close to wild life, and turning a blind eye to people who collect bits and pieces, artefacts or penguin eggs or whatever.\"",

Under a proactive chief, Brigadier Richards, and wearing its own badges, the regiment seems to have taken over unofficial command, instructing, training, cajoling, helicoptering the UN blue berets towards being a more effective peace force.</p> <p>Now comes the real political test, which is, quite simply, will we have the nerve to leave? The pressure not to will be great. For Sierra Leone confronts the UN with the greatest crisis in its recent history. Intended to be 11,000-strong, the force there is the largest UN peacekeeping army in the world. Yet it is pathetically failing. It has become hostage - 350 are literally hostages - to the armed gangs of rebel forces who are destabilising the regime it should be defending. Its mandate was clear enough, and extraneous security council complications, such as China and Russia applied in Kosovo, are absent.

Michael Ignatieff, a passionate upholder of international morality, wrote this week in the New York Times that the UN system has reached the end of the road. The neutrality on which it rests is no longer valid, he says. In the post-cold war era, the major disputes, Sierra Leone among them, are between plain good and evil, a dichotomy the UN declines adequately to recognise even as its troops watch Rwandan civilians being hacked to death (1994), or permit the massacre of thousands of civilians by Bosnian Serbs at Srebrenica (1995). A new kind of world order hoves into view, in which the security council authorises combat warriors to deploy against obvious regional barbarians, such as the Revolutionary United Front who are maiming and slaughtering the innocent in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>This counsel of despair is unlikely to find favour. It begs too many awkward questions about where the lines of evil are drawn, and what sort of warriors might be recruited to fight a foreign war. To stave it off, UN voices will ask the British to stay in Sierra Leone and help the force there turn itself round. The Brits could no doubt achieve a lot, with their superior training and experience. It will be tempting to listen to the case. The moral force of this, after all, will remain. A government that has forsworn the normal rules of national self-interest in judging when to make its forces internationally available - as Blairite Britain, unlike the US, has done - is vulnerable to persuasion that its duty isn't finished. The horrors will go on. The case for an ongoing presence as part of the UN force itself for however long it takes can be powerfully made.</p> <p>It needs to be firmly resisted. The pocket generals at the Foreign Office and the fervent moralist in Downing Street need alike to restrain themselves. There is a clear limit to what Britain can or should do. Rather effectively, edging beyond the first stated purpose, we are doing it. This could yet become a modest case-study in focused interventionism, provided it acknowledges that a deeply imperfect situation has to be left behind. The struggle must be resumed at a political level to make the UN, especially the security council, more honest: not making promises it cannot keep, not committing to operations its members decline to man, not watching its moral authority drain away.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of acres of crops tainted by GM pollen have been growing in Britain for more than a year and may have been used in food production, the government admitted last night in a move that is highly embarrassing for its scientific advisers, who had previously claimed there was little risk of cross-pollination with conventional crops. Hundreds of farmers have unwittingly planted the contaminated seed over two spring seasons without the safeguards used for GM field trials, but ministers, whose officials had known about the problem for a month, insisted there was no risk to health or the environment. The seeds came from the Canadian prairies, from plants that were growing more than 800 metres away from the nearest GM varieties but still picked up traces of modified material. The tainted seed is thought to have been used on 9,000 hectares last year, nearly 2% of the rape crop. This year it has probably been used on 4,700 hectares, involving between 500 and 600 farmers. It also emerged that there had been no random testing of imports of conventional seed for rogue GM material, despite the rapid spread of GM crops through the United States, Canada and Brazil. In this country no GM seeds are to be sold to farmers until after three years of farm trials to test their impact on the environment and wildlife. Opposition parties immediately condemned ministers for the lack of proper controls on seeds, and for the delay and the low key announcement, made through a parliamentary written answer. The Liberal Democrats' environment spokesman, David Heath, said the delay and the manner in which the government announcement had been made was deeply disturbing. \"It is another example of the contempt in which the government holds the British public,\" he said. The Tory spokesman, Tim Yeo, accused the government of a \"willingness to allow commercial considerations to override the need to protect the British environment\". The latest embarrassment came a day after it emerged that some British honey might have been contaminated by pollen from GM trials. The seeds discovery was made during testing of imported seeds by the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg. The international company responsible, Advanta Seeds, was informed by one of its customers in the state. Its British arm was told on April 3, and took steps to stop further sales while it began its own testing; this revealed a GM presence of up to 1% in seeds grown in 1998 and sold over the past two years. The company told government officials on April 17. It was worried because the GM oilseed rape which tainted the conventional seed had no commercial licences for sales to farmers in Europe, but it could not inform its distributors or farmers until the government acted. \"We are absolutely dismayed,\" said Mike Ruthven, general manager of Advanta Seeds UK. \"We are very concerned for consumers, because of the sensitivity of these things. We believe we are extremely responsible and we are gobsmacked that this has happened with an orthodox crop.\" He said the advice from the government so far was that no regulation had been broken, and there was no threat to health or the environment - \"although we have had some difficulty in getting those statements\". The 1999 seed crop had not been contaminated because the company had by then moved its seed growing from Alberta, Canada, to Ontario in eastern Canada, Montana in the US, and New Zealand. Oilseed rape is used in foods such as margarine and in industrial processes, but the GM material that has been available from abroad was passed as safe by government advisers several years ago. The seed is also thought to have been used on 600 hectares in France, 500 in Sweden and 400 in Germany, causing international embarrassment and highlighting a lack of international regulation of seed purity. Baroness Hayman, the agriculture minister, said there would be new spot checks on imports and work with the industry on a new code of practice: \"This is not a safety issue... However, the issue of seed purity is a serious one.\"",

      "body": "<p>Government analysts said yesterday that evidence of anthrax had been found in victims of a mysterious disease that has killed 11 Scottish heroin addicts in recent weeks and left 15 more in hospital. </p> <p>Scientists at Porton Down, Wiltshire, confirmed a report in the forthcoming issue of New Scientist magazine that antibodies against anthrax spores have been found in blood samples from two of the victims. The anthrax theory is expected to be confirmed or ruled out by the end of the week after further tests. </p> <p>If confirmed, the deaths suggest that a consignment of heroin contaminated with the deadly bacterium is loose on the streets of Europe. </p> <p>However, Glasgow health officials yesterday played down the theory, saying the Porton Down findings were only weak, indirect evidence. </p> <p>\"I'm very sceptical,\" said Laurence Gruer, consultant in public health medicine on Greater Glasgow health board. \"I can't 100% rule it out, but I would have expected a lot more evidence for anthrax.\" </p> <p>Cases of dead and dying heroin users with similar and unusual symptoms began to pile up on Dr Gruer's desk at the end of last month. The 11th victim died on Tuesday. </p> <p>All had injected the drug into their muscles, rather than their veins, either by accident or because scars from overuse of a needle meant that free-flowing blood could no longer be found in surface veins. Many of the victims have been women, whose veins tend to be less accessible than men's. </p> <p>The anthrax connection was first mooted by scientists at the centre for applied microbiology and research, which is alongside the Ministry of Defence's biological warfare lab at Porton Down but is run by the Department of Health. </p> <p>They noticed a report from Norway, posted on the internet, of an Oslo addict who died in April after injecting heroin into his muscle. A postmortem showed anthrax bacilli in his spinal fluid. Aware of the deaths in Scotland, CAMR asked the Glasgow health board to send some samples. </p> <p>A CAMR spokesman, Phil Luton, said: \"We got two very weak positives, which is not conclusive evidence of anthrax, but we can't rule it out and are continuing to test.\" </p> <p>The victims' symptoms were indicative of anthrax, he said. Phil Hanna, an anthrax specialist at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, made the same observation in the New Scientist report. </p> <p>The Scottish victims - 10 from Glasgow, one from Aberdeen - all died in a similar way: several hours after injecting they had accumulated symptoms including a heavy build-up of fluid, leakage of fluids round the heart and lungs, and rapidly rising white blood cell counts as their metabolism rallied to fight a major infection. </p> <p>Dr Gruer said he hoped to get the further test results from CAMR today or tomorrow. </p> <p>Besides the Porton Down tests, he said, Glasgow specialists had been culturing blood and tissue samples from the victims to see if anthrax spores could be detected through a microscope, but with negative results. </p> <p>Other theories have included necrotising fasciitis, known as flesh-eating disease, or alternative contaminants in heroin, or the citric acid used by addicts to dissolve heroin in water to make an injectable solution. </p> <p>The muscle-injecting addicts have complained that lately they have had to use more acid than usual, causing a burning sensation and, doctors speculate, severe muscle damage. </p> <p>Dr Gruer said one possibility was that the muscle damage had combined with minor bacterial infections to cause the addicts' deaths. </p> <p>Anthrax is not passed from person to person, so there is no risk of an epidemic outside the heroin-injecting community even if it turns out to be the cause. </p> <p>It is not clear how it may have contaminated heroin, although the bacterium is endemic in livestock in prime heroin poppy growing regions such as Afghanistan.</p>",

However, Glasgow health officials yesterday played down the theory, saying the Porton Down findings were only weak, indirect evidence. \"I'm very sceptical,\" said Laurence Gruer, consultant in public health medicine on Greater Glasgow health board. \"I can't 100% rule it out, but I would have expected a lot more evidence for anthrax.\" Cases of dead and dying heroin users with similar and unusual symptoms began to pile up on Dr Gruer's desk at the end of last month. The 11th victim died on Tuesday. All had injected the drug into their muscles, rather than their veins, either by accident or because scars from overuse of a needle meant that free-flowing blood could no longer be found in surface veins. Many of the victims have been women, whose veins tend to be less accessible than men's. The anthrax connection was first mooted by scientists at the centre for applied microbiology and research, which is alongside the Ministry of Defence's biological warfare lab at Porton Down but is run by the Department of Health. They noticed a report from Norway, posted on the internet, of an Oslo addict who died in April after injecting heroin into his muscle. A postmortem showed anthrax bacilli in his spinal fluid. Aware of the deaths in Scotland, CAMR asked the Glasgow health board to send some samples. A CAMR spokesman, Phil Luton, said: \"We got two very weak positives, which is not conclusive evidence of anthrax, but we can't rule it out and are continuing to test.\" The victims' symptoms were indicative of anthrax, he said. Phil Hanna, an anthrax specialist at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, made the same observation in the New Scientist report. The Scottish victims - 10 from Glasgow, one from Aberdeen - all died in a similar way: several hours after injecting they had accumulated symptoms including a heavy build-up of fluid, leakage of fluids round the heart and lungs, and rapidly rising white blood cell counts as their metabolism rallied to fight a major infection. Dr Gruer said he hoped to get the further test results from CAMR today or tomorrow. Besides the Porton Down tests, he said, Glasgow specialists had been culturing blood and tissue samples from the victims to see if anthrax spores could be detected through a microscope, but with negative results. Other theories have included necrotising fasciitis, known as flesh-eating disease, or alternative contaminants in heroin, or the citric acid used by addicts to dissolve heroin in water to make an injectable solution. The muscle-injecting addicts have complained that lately they have had to use more acid than usual, causing a burning sensation and, doctors speculate, severe muscle damage. Dr Gruer said one possibility was that the muscle damage had combined with minor bacterial infections to cause the addicts' deaths. Anthrax is not passed from person to person, so there is no risk of an epidemic outside the heroin-injecting community even if it turns out to be the cause. It is not clear how it may have contaminated heroin, although the bacterium is endemic in livestock in prime heroin poppy growing regions such as Afghanistan.",

But both reports recommend setting up independent teams of investigators for the rest. The Liberty report goes further than the KPMG proposals, which recommend that only the most serious complaints - those involving deaths in custody, police chases which end in fatal crashes, and serious criminal offences - be investigated by outside teams. Liberty recommends that in all cases involving the death of a civilian, serious injury, corruption or racial discrimination, an outside investigation would be compulsory. The human rights group also argues that at least 25% of all other complaints should be subject to an external investigation. The KPMG scheme would investigate around 1,000 cases annually, compared with 2,000 under Liberty's proposals, making the latter more expensive. The human rights group's plan would cost more than \u00a320m, while the management consultants estimate theirs at \u00a314m annually.

      "bodyText": "President Mbeki of South Africa arrives in London today for a two-day visit, in the midst of still greater pessimism about \"the hopeless continent\", as the Economist calls it. With most of South Africa's neighbours in disarray, western investors and diplomats fear that it will soon be infected by the crisis in Zimbabwe. The British media have complained that Mbeki has not spoken out against Mugabe's violence; and even the Foreign Office, influenced by Robin Cook's \"ethical foreign policy\", have appeared critical of his restraint. Why doesn't he speak out more openly against Mugabe's plunder of white farms, and his encouragement of violence? Why does he have to follow the tradition of African presidents closing their ranks to rally round dictators? But the trouble with these criticisms is that they all depict the Zimbabwe problem in racial terms, in simple black and white - which is just what Mugabe needs to win his election. The more he can depict his opposition as being supported by white farmers and the British government, the more he can deflect criticism of his own corruption and disastrous mismanagement. And it is just this racial polarisation which President Mbeki has to avoid. It is important to try to see the problem of Zimbabwe from Mbeki's viewpoint. He has always been a master of discreet diplomacy, and his handling of Mugabe may prove his most difficult test.

Kevin Cobb, 38, faces life imprisonment after being found guilty at the Old Bailey of the manslaughter of Susan Annis, who died after he spiked her drink with the sedative Midazolam in order to rape her in November 1996. The two had been taking part in a residential course on paediatric care at the Royal Brompton hospital, west London. Cobb, from Yateley, Hampshire, was also convicted of administering Midazolam and raping two women at St Peter's hospital, Chertsey, Surrey, where he was a senior staff accident and emergency nurse in January 1999, and drugging a third woman with the intention of raping her in December 1998. Adjourning sentencing pending psychiatric reports judge Martin Stephens told Cobb he could expect a \"lengthy prison sentence\" and indicated he would consider life. Cobb stood motionless as the jury of seven women and five men returned the guilty verdicts, watched by Ms Annis's parents, Audrey and David and his three surviving victims who wept in the public gallery. Midazolam, a powerful anaesthetic used in minor surgery, leaves patients unable to remember what has happened to them. \"We cannot dismiss the existence of other victims,\" said DS David Cook of Surrey police, who led the investigation.\"Between killing Susan Annis in 1996 and the three later attacks in 1999, I find it hard to believe that an evil and dangerous man like Kevin Cobb was not active in that time.\" Ms Annis's death was not initially thought to be suspicious.

New guidelines on the classification and storage of drugs would be circulated to hospitals shortly, a spokesman said. Drug that made victims forget Clinical amnesia, the quality which makes Midazolam medically valuable, enabled Cobb to mount a systematic campaign of rape and sexual abuse. A member of the benzodiazepine sedative group (along with Rohypnol and Temazipan) Midazolam is prized for its amnesiac qualities. It is widely used in paediatrics and dentistry, typically for endoscopic examinations where a child may find the experience traumatic unless sedated. A patient will come round from a 5ml intravenous dose of the drug within two hours and not recall details of an operation, but doctors administering the drug always carry the antidote with them to guard against accidental overdoses. The drug breaks down rapidly and will disappear from a patient's system within 48 hours, making its detection in criminal cases problematic - forensic evidence of Midazolam was obtained for just two of Cobb's victims. Midazolam can also cause paralysis, blurred vision and sexual fantasies in some patients, another factor that complicated the prosecution case against Cobb.

His grief, combined with professional curiosity, took him to Westminster coroner's court. He doubted that Ms Annis would have taken Midazolam herself and wrote to Dr Knapman asking him to carry out further tests. Dr Knapman did so but decided to take the matter no further.</p> <p>Dr Parsley kept his misgivings to himself until a chance conversation at a friend's retirement party last year. He was told by an accquaintance from St Peter's that a nurse at the hospital had been arrested in connection with the drugging and rape of a patient. The nurse was Cobb, the drug Midazolam.</p> <p>The following day Dr Parsley contacted Surrey police anonymously and told them to re-examine the death of Susan Annis.</p> <p>Yet had Cobb administered a larger quantity of Midazolam to his final victim, an IT manager aged 34, he might have escaped conviction. His undoing was that for once the drug failed him, and his victim remembered what happened.</p> <p>In mid-January last year the woman, who cannot be named, attended St Peter's complaining of abdominal pains. Cobb wheeled her to a cubicle where he told her to undress while he left the room. When he returned he said he wanted to take a blood sample and told her to look away. As she did so he pumped her vein with Midazolam.</p> <p>His victim told the Old Bailey: \"Next thing I knew I seemed to be coming round in a concerned state to a strange situation ... something was horribly wrong ... He was naked from the waist down ... I thought 'Oh my God he's penetrated me'...</p> <p>The following day Cobb was arrested. Six months later, following Dr Parsley's call, he was re-arrested and charged with Susan Annis's murder. The publicity brought another victim forward. A mother of three, aged 34, a business analyst, had attended St Peter's in December, 1998, with appendicitis. Cobb took her to a treatment room, asked her to undress, then told her he was going to administer a pre-med injection. No pre-med had been ordered. While she was unconscious Cobb raped her.</p> <p>The woman was troubled by a dream that someone had had sex with her. At an identity parade she picked Cobb out of a line-up.</p> <p>St Peter's wrote to patients asking if anything unusual had happened to them during their visit. A warehouse manager aged 34 came forward. She too had been injected with Midazolan. She also picked Cobb out at an identity parade.</p>",

Midazolam is valued in dentistry and paediatric care because of its principal side effect, clinical amnesia. After coming to, patients are unable to recall clearly what has happened to them. John Parsley, a doctor, was a close friend and colleague of Ms Annis at Crawley hospital and was deeply upset at her sudden death. His grief, combined with professional curiosity, took him to Westminster coroner's court. He doubted that Ms Annis would have taken Midazolam herself and wrote to Dr Knapman asking him to carry out further tests. Dr Knapman did so but decided to take the matter no further. Dr Parsley kept his misgivings to himself until a chance conversation at a friend's retirement party last year. He was told by an accquaintance from St Peter's that a nurse at the hospital had been arrested in connection with the drugging and rape of a patient. The nurse was Cobb, the drug Midazolam. The following day Dr Parsley contacted Surrey police anonymously and told them to re-examine the death of Susan Annis. Yet had Cobb administered a larger quantity of Midazolam to his final victim, an IT manager aged 34, he might have escaped conviction. His undoing was that for once the drug failed him, and his victim remembered what happened. In mid-January last year the woman, who cannot be named, attended St Peter's complaining of abdominal pains. Cobb wheeled her to a cubicle where he told her to undress while he left the room. When he returned he said he wanted to take a blood sample and told her to look away. As she did so he pumped her vein with Midazolam. His victim told the Old Bailey: \"Next thing I knew I seemed to be coming round in a concerned state to a strange situation ... something was horribly wrong ... He was naked from the waist down ... I thought 'Oh my God he's penetrated me'... The following day Cobb was arrested. Six months later, following Dr Parsley's call, he was re-arrested and charged with Susan Annis's murder. The publicity brought another victim forward. A mother of three, aged 34, a business analyst, had attended St Peter's in December, 1998, with appendicitis. Cobb took her to a treatment room, asked her to undress, then told her he was going to administer a pre-med injection. No pre-med had been ordered. While she was unconscious Cobb raped her. The woman was troubled by a dream that someone had had sex with her. At an identity parade she picked Cobb out of a line-up. St Peter's wrote to patients asking if anything unusual had happened to them during their visit. A warehouse manager aged 34 came forward. She too had been injected with Midazolan. She also picked Cobb out at an identity parade.",

      "bodyText": "If you are a struggling dot.com and you cannot understand why your site is not attracting huge amounts of traffic, you might need a dollop of custard. As internet fever cools and investors become increasingly sceptical about sinking their hard-earned cash into the net, a new agency called Hot Custard has launched offering dot.coms an online rescue service. Set up by former Marks &amp; Spencer retail marketeer Jan Selfridge and ex-creative director of Abbott Mead and Vickers Ian Standing, Hotcustard.com hopes to fix everything from marketing and technology problems to any e-fulfilment difficulties. So why the off-the-wall name? \"You can pour custard on anything and you can make it better,\" quips Selfridge, who knows that in a crowded agency marketplace the name will be hard for budding net entrepreneurs to forget. Convinced that too many web sites lack a coherent strategy, she claims Hot Custard's hard-nosed approach is attracting a lot of interest from floundering dot.coms. \"It's not about the number of whizzy devices you can put on a screen, it's about having a purpose for being on the web and devising a strategy to drive people to your site. \"There are an awful lot of dot.coms who have got a good idea but have not executed it from a marketing perspective. Unless your site appeals to the people you are aiming at, it's not going to work.\" Hot Custard offers sickly web sites an e-doctor service and currently one of the most common complaints is falling traffic. In finding a cure, the Hot Custard team will assess the functionality of the site, its ease of use, and how people get to it from other destinations on the web. Both Selfridge and Standing have strong backgrounds in creative advertising and they are pretty scathing about the calibre of recent dot.com campaigns.

Had he taken the loot, the publicity might have forestalled the occasion when he was stumped by the New York Times crossword and the clue \"dead American poet\" - until the adjacent words made these seven letters the inevitable Shapiro.</p> <p>Poetry was the stuff of life itself for Shapiro. Palpably so. In bed with a woman not his wife, \"he was on the rise, pushing away at her with her legs over his shoulders, when she said to him in a calm voice, 'Allen Ginsberg says you can't write for shit.' His erection immediately shrank and his penis fell out.\" Such was Shapiro's generosity that he had encouraged Ginsberg, but of the century's poets it was WH Auden that he revered.</p> <p>Born in Baltimore, the son of a travelling salesman, he was acutely aware of being in the shadow of a brother to whom he was close and also of an American melting pot which ranked \"Jews as a cut above Negroes but not much\". Shapiro, with what he called an irrational fear of those Jews who sported long black coats and broad-brimmed black hats, was himself more attuned to that cast of mind in which everyone \"was engaged in a game of discontinuity, the loosening of ties, the cultivation of forgetfulness... the ones who prided themselves on continuity were to be feared or laughed at - Americans with coats-of-arms!\" Even so, he turned Carl into the tonier Karl when he was an adult.</p> <p>When he was six, the family moved to Chicago, returning to his birthplace a decade later. Early on, he delighted in the sets of classic authors collected by his father, simultaneously finding relish in women's ankles, later asserting that their inner thighs were \"the most exquisite curve in the universe\". Which makes it surprising that Gerard Manley Hopkins's poetry was to be his \"guide for life\". Shapiro knew that he himself was not homosexual \"and eventually felt the cruder for it\".</p> <p>As an adolescent he sported an unread copy of Immanuel Kant's The Critique Of Pure Reason. Unemployed, he wrote tragedies in iambic pentameter. There were consolations. Always referring to himself in the third person with that involved detachment which also characterises his best poems, he recalled the widow who \"seduced him, and that was not what he wanted. He wanted the daughter. That was not quite it, either; he wanted culture, with the daughter thrown in for good measure perhaps.\"</p> <p>Such was the pattern of his life. He now discovered Auden and, as his father had made money by selling oil in cans, Shapiro could publish a volume of his own poems: he gave away copies, reviewed it under a pseudonym - and later regretted the whole endeavour, but that did not prevent a microfilm edition in the 1960s by a firm \"in England, wherever High Wycombe was\".</p> <p>Auden said that poetry does not make anything happen, but this volume got Shapiro into university - and a letter from William Carlos Williams. But he could not study. At the University of Virginia, preoccupied with his own writing, he became a rare drop-out. It left him with a taste for classical music - and, needs must, two years of touring the country to sell samples, which led to relationships along the way, including one in which they \"pushed tearfully and willingly, she in the direction of marriage, and he in the direction of himself\".</p> <p>His father then left, with which Shapiro, his mother, sister and a schoolmistress went to California - he and the schoolmistress duly absconding on a boat to Tahiti, which only brought him a craving to be in Atlantic City. He did not know quite why, but it was partly a desire for education and for the schoolmistress's sister, who, to his chagrin, duly locked one of his plays in a trunk.</p> <p>In a vivid piece of analysis, he recalled leaving another girl's bed before her father returned and, on the walk home, saw an automobile smash. The grim event gave him new metrical insight as he fashioned an opening line about an ambulance \"its quick soft silver bell beating, beating\". (He is always excellent on metrical matters, \"a thing of second nature\".)</p> <p>He had a night job at Sears-Roebuck, to fund his studies at Johns Hopkins University, where he recalled sex with almost as much relish as his enjoyment of Milton and Rupert Brooke. Across an examination paper a don wrote, \"too bitter against big business\". He lost his scholarship. Sad and relieved to leave the place, he joined Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Library School, but all the while war threatened and in March 1941 he was summoned to the United States army.</p> <p>\"In the army one could be a poet without anybody knowing it.\" He was now being published, his girlfriend Evalyn Katz acting as effective ad hoc agent, and he \"was in an ecstasy of confidence and pride\"; and disliked being known as the war poet, which he remains. He had thought that service would last a year, but was soon in the Medical Corps and, aboard the Queen Mary for Australia, he used the time to translate Baudelaire. Melbourne yielded magazines aplenty, and it was the matter of a moment to meet the wife of an absent editor: \"the love affair burst into a conflagration. . . she invited him to bugger her but he didn't know how and was too Jewish to commit Sodom and Gomorrah with the woman who had impassioned him.\"</p> <p>Whatever this shortcoming, they collaborated on a book, The Place of Love, and, when he was moved on to Sydney, he wrote a poem about its low life which shocked her. There he found solace in another journalist whose husband was duly killed.</p> <p>Shapiro's platoon was sent, as a diversionary tactic, to New Guinea, where he produced his most anthologised poems, such as Sunday: New Guinea: </p> <ul> <p>I long for lounging in the afternoons<br>Of clean intelligent warmth, <br> my brother's mind, <br>Talk without reference, and palindromes, <br> Sleep and the Philharmonic and the ponderous Times. </p> </ul> He noted of hospital decorum that \"a nurse could bandage your balls if need be, but didn't have to contemplate them in passing\". Aboard ship he had written the polemical poem Essay On Rime, whose loose blank verse was his first sustained attack on modern criticism. He found himself that strange phenomenon, \"a poet in the Battle Zone, which he had seen almost nothing of, who was serenely writing good poetry\". He had still not seen his own first book People, Place And Thing, published in 1942. <p>On his return to the US, he married Evalyn and was promptly sent to oversee internees in Missouri before despatch to New York and the twin task - for the army - of seeking out spies and editing a poetry anthology. With equal surprise, he found himself made consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress for a year in 1947. Such was the effect of winning the Pulitzer Prize for V-Letter (1944), something about which he remained ambiguous. \"Shapiro, we don't want any Communists or cocksuckers in the library,\" he was told by the librarian. Even so, he relished the hucksterism of the job, such as cajoling poets to record without royalty payments (Eliot demanded some).</p> <p>Never shirking controversy, he refused in 1948 to vote in favour of the antisemitic Ezra Pound getting the first Bollingen Prize for The Pisan Cantos as the best book of verse by an American poet in that year. Previous experience of university life did not prevent his accepting a post at Johns Hopkins, \"a cabal of snobbery of the worst kind\".</p> <p>For six years, from 1950, he edited the venerable Poetry - in tandem with editing the Newberry Library Journal, which chronicled the acquisition of books in languages which he often did not know. Poetry involved much fund-raising, sometimes in the company of Adlai Stevenson's wife: \"He had never had anything to do with her amorously, though nobody believed him because by that time he had earned a reputation for sleeping with everything in skirts.\"</p> <p>In 1956 he became a professor at Lincoln in Nebraska, and editor of the Prairie Schooner, from which he resigned in 1966 when not allowed to print a poem about a homosexual. \"I'm not really a professor, but a sort of mad guest,\" he said of his stints at the University of Chicago and the University of California at Davis. He called his prose \"mad-dog criticism\", distinctly influenced by his fellow Baltimorean, HL Mencken. Whatever the turmoil it caused, he could not give it up.</p> <p>He divorced in 1967, then married Teri Kovach, the subject of his White-Haired Lover, who died in 1982. Three years later he married Sophie Wilkins.</p> <p>He toured the world, down to an Indian trip (to lecture on Whitman!) on which he heard the announcement, \"We have a practice pilot. We will make four landings.\" The way that he shed jobs astonished his friends but he knew that he \"lacked ease, the particular insouciance which makes a professor tenable\". He was a prolific, unabashed poet, and treasures always surface, such as the brilliantly blasphemous The Confirmation, about first masturbation.</p> <p>Although not desiring material things, he was labelled \"the bourgeois poet\", a phrase he then took for a series of prose poems which were not his most successful. He shook off the worry that he was becoming a stuffed shirt, but - dislike the Kennedys though he did - \"he had gotten into the habit of calling himself a patriot\", which is not perhaps the first label for the author of a semi-pornographic novel, Edsel, which blows the lid on the midwest. Just as he was sanguine over the disappearance of his poems from anthologies, so he shrugged when the prospect of riches was dashed when the publisher of the novel went bankrupt (authors were not \"preferred creditors\").</p> <p>And he remained philosophical when a school pupil who wrote to ask about \"your wife and children, what prizes you have won, your definition of poetry, and your decline\". At least the pupil did not think he was dead, but perhaps it is as well for schoolchildren to concentrate on the war poems rather than Fucking, which Shapiro published at 80 and has the memorably implausible opening line, \"I never got the hang of it, really.\"</p> <p>He is survived by a son and daughter from his marriage to Evalyn, three grandchildren and one great grandchild, and his wife Sophie.</p> <p>\u0095Karl Shapiro, poet, born November 10 1913; died May 14 2000</p>",

At the University of Virginia, preoccupied with his own writing, he became a rare drop-out. It left him with a taste for classical music - and, needs must, two years of touring the country to sell samples, which led to relationships along the way, including one in which they \"pushed tearfully and willingly, she in the direction of marriage, and he in the direction of himself\". His father then left, with which Shapiro, his mother, sister and a schoolmistress went to California - he and the schoolmistress duly absconding on a boat to Tahiti, which only brought him a craving to be in Atlantic City. He did not know quite why, but it was partly a desire for education and for the schoolmistress's sister, who, to his chagrin, duly locked one of his plays in a trunk. In a vivid piece of analysis, he recalled leaving another girl's bed before her father returned and, on the walk home, saw an automobile smash. The grim event gave him new metrical insight as he fashioned an opening line about an ambulance \"its quick soft silver bell beating, beating\". (He is always excellent on metrical matters, \"a thing of second nature\".) He had a night job at Sears-Roebuck, to fund his studies at Johns Hopkins University, where he recalled sex with almost as much relish as his enjoyment of Milton and Rupert Brooke. Across an examination paper a don wrote, \"too bitter against big business\". He lost his scholarship. Sad and relieved to leave the place, he joined Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Library School, but all the while war threatened and in March 1941 he was summoned to the United States army. \"In the army one could be a poet without anybody knowing it.\" He was now being published, his girlfriend Evalyn Katz acting as effective ad hoc agent, and he \"was in an ecstasy of confidence and pride\"; and disliked being known as the war poet, which he remains. He had thought that service would last a year, but was soon in the Medical Corps and, aboard the Queen Mary for Australia, he used the time to translate Baudelaire. Melbourne yielded magazines aplenty, and it was the matter of a moment to meet the wife of an absent editor: \"the love affair burst into a conflagration. . . she invited him to bugger her but he didn't know how and was too Jewish to commit Sodom and Gomorrah with the woman who had impassioned him.\" Whatever this shortcoming, they collaborated on a book, The Place of Love, and, when he was moved on to Sydney, he wrote a poem about its low life which shocked her. There he found solace in another journalist whose husband was duly killed. Shapiro's platoon was sent, as a diversionary tactic, to New Guinea, where he produced his most anthologised poems, such as Sunday: New Guinea: I long for lounging in the afternoons Of clean intelligent warmth, my brother's mind, Talk without reference, and palindromes, Sleep and the Philharmonic and the ponderous Times. He noted of hospital decorum that \"a nurse could bandage your balls if need be, but didn't have to contemplate them in passing\". Aboard ship he had written the polemical poem Essay On Rime, whose loose blank verse was his first sustained attack on modern criticism. He found himself that strange phenomenon, \"a poet in the Battle Zone, which he had seen almost nothing of, who was serenely writing good poetry\". He had still not seen his own first book People, Place And Thing, published in 1942. On his return to the US, he married Evalyn and was promptly sent to oversee internees in Missouri before despatch to New York and the twin task - for the army - of seeking out spies and editing a poetry anthology. With equal surprise, he found himself made consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress for a year in 1947. Such was the effect of winning the Pulitzer Prize for V-Letter (1944), something about which he remained ambiguous. \"Shapiro, we don't want any Communists or cocksuckers in the library,\" he was told by the librarian. Even so, he relished the hucksterism of the job, such as cajoling poets to record without royalty payments (Eliot demanded some). Never shirking controversy, he refused in 1948 to vote in favour of the antisemitic Ezra Pound getting the first Bollingen Prize for The Pisan Cantos as the best book of verse by an American poet in that year. Previous experience of university life did not prevent his accepting a post at Johns Hopkins, \"a cabal of snobbery of the worst kind\". For six years, from 1950, he edited the venerable Poetry - in tandem with editing the Newberry Library Journal, which chronicled the acquisition of books in languages which he often did not know. Poetry involved much fund-raising, sometimes in the company of Adlai Stevenson's wife: \"He had never had anything to do with her amorously, though nobody believed him because by that time he had earned a reputation for sleeping with everything in skirts.\" In 1956 he became a professor at Lincoln in Nebraska, and editor of the Prairie Schooner, from which he resigned in 1966 when not allowed to print a poem about a homosexual. \"I'm not really a professor, but a sort of mad guest,\" he said of his stints at the University of Chicago and the University of California at Davis. He called his prose \"mad-dog criticism\", distinctly influenced by his fellow Baltimorean, HL Mencken. Whatever the turmoil it caused, he could not give it up. He divorced in 1967, then married Teri Kovach, the subject of his White-Haired Lover, who died in 1982. Three years later he married Sophie Wilkins. He toured the world, down to an Indian trip (to lecture on Whitman!) on which he heard the announcement, \"We have a practice pilot. We will make four landings.\" The way that he shed jobs astonished his friends but he knew that he \"lacked ease, the particular insouciance which makes a professor tenable\". He was a prolific, unabashed poet, and treasures always surface, such as the brilliantly blasphemous The Confirmation, about first masturbation. Although not desiring material things, he was labelled \"the bourgeois poet\", a phrase he then took for a series of prose poems which were not his most successful. He shook off the worry that he was becoming a stuffed shirt, but - dislike the Kennedys though he did - \"he had gotten into the habit of calling himself a patriot\", which is not perhaps the first label for the author of a semi-pornographic novel, Edsel, which blows the lid on the midwest. Just as he was sanguine over the disappearance of his poems from anthologies, so he shrugged when the prospect of riches was dashed when the publisher of the novel went bankrupt (authors were not \"preferred creditors\"). And he remained philosophical when a school pupil who wrote to ask about \"your wife and children, what prizes you have won, your definition of poetry, and your decline\". At least the pupil did not think he was dead, but perhaps it is as well for schoolchildren to concentrate on the war poems rather than Fucking, which Shapiro published at 80 and has the memorably implausible opening line, \"I never got the hang of it, really.\" He is survived by a son and daughter from his marriage to Evalyn, three grandchildren and one great grandchild, and his wife Sophie. \u0095Karl Shapiro, poet, born November 10 1913; died May 14 2000",

In 1938, after studies in jazz piano with Leo Mathiesen, Bentzon entered the Copenhagen conservatory studying piano and organ, graduating in 1942 with the conservatory's highest marks.

Bentzon made many recordings of his work over the years, including his entire Tempered Klavier (1964-96), the first volume of which was written for his son, Nicolaj, who helped premiere his father's For Six Hands at the composer's 80th birthday concert last year.</p> <p>Bentzon's was a constantly questing and exploratory spirit. He tried his hand at every music genre and style, from jazz (an early, but lifelong, enthusiasm), to 12-note music (on which he published a book in 1953), to neo-classicism, the style in which most of his finest and best-known music was written in the 1940s and 1950s.</p> <p>Although Nielsen, Brahms, Hindemith and Bartok formed his stylistic bedrock, in the mid-60s Bentzon's pieces such as the ensemble improvisation Third Stream Music, Bijouterie and Variable Music showed him tackling the \"music of chance\" espoused by John Cage and \"happenings\" of the avant-garde which resulted in an \"audio-visual concert piece\" in 1971.</p> <p>Such an interest was not surprising given Bentzon's studies in jazz and organ-playing, both disciplines employing improvisatory techniques.

Hundreds of armed police stormed the Belgrade headquarters of Studio B, the only opposition television station able to broadcast to a large part of the country. Police also shut down the highest circulation newspaper in Yugoslavia, Blic, which sells 200,000 copies a day, Serbia's popular radio station B2-92, the student radio Indeks and another television and radio station, all of which were housed in the same building. Leaders of Belgrade council, which is controlled by the opposition and owns Studio B, met diplomats from at least 11 countries soon after the shutdown.

During the day large crowds gathered outside the Studio B building and the city assembly, where opposition leaders met editors and directors from the media to discuss a response.

Sir Edward wrote: \"The whole of this rather chatty account of MI5 and its doings will do harm to [its] reputation ... and make it infinitely harder to deal with others in the public service, who may wish similarly to embark on undesirable publicity.\" Sir Frank even suppressed one titbit they had previously approved, which had actually already been quoted in the press: \"Although the Russians had already read the article in the Empire News, it seemed rather a pity to offer it to a much wider audience.\" When the book, Cloak Without Dagger, finally came out, it contained little of value.

      "body": "<p>Here at Shed Productions it's more like work in limbo actually. Like anxious relatives clustered around a cardiac patient, we monitor the heartbeat highs and lows of Bad Girls ratings. More highs than lows - thank you for asking. </p> <p>We have further trials ahead: ITV has asked us to tender for the early evening soap to replace Home And Away (as in away to Channel 5). Down to the final four candidates, yesterday we were summoned to hear their initial views. It took you back - as my colleague Maureen Chadwick observed - to the days of the old schoolyard. Drama supremos Nick Elliott and Jenny Reeks, a very creditable headmaster/matron combo; us, eager pupils awaiting end of term results. So, cheesy grins (they \"liked the overall concept\") and bottom lips quivering (\"they \"nevertheless had some concerns\"). </p> <p>I can't divulge too much about our bid - suffice to say that it isn't based in a motel somewhere in the Midlands. What we do learn (and probably suspected already), is that a new soap for the millennium (and I bet that was in everyone's proposals) often means the conciliation of the seemingly contradictory. It has to be young, but not frighten off the grannies. It can be metropolitan, but can't alienate the regions. Not too gritty, not too fluffy, not too... etc, etc. </p> <p>It could all be so daunting, but what no commissioner - ITV or BBC - wants is some sitting-on-the-fence compromise.

      "bodyText": "Here at Shed Productions it's more like work in limbo actually. Like anxious relatives clustered around a cardiac patient, we monitor the heartbeat highs and lows of Bad Girls ratings. More highs than lows - thank you for asking. We have further trials ahead: ITV has asked us to tender for the early evening soap to replace Home And Away (as in away to Channel 5). Down to the final four candidates, yesterday we were summoned to hear their initial views. It took you back - as my colleague Maureen Chadwick observed - to the days of the old schoolyard. Drama supremos Nick Elliott and Jenny Reeks, a very creditable headmaster/matron combo; us, eager pupils awaiting end of term results. So, cheesy grins (they \"liked the overall concept\") and bottom lips quivering (\"they \"nevertheless had some concerns\"). I can't divulge too much about our bid - suffice to say that it isn't based in a motel somewhere in the Midlands. What we do learn (and probably suspected already), is that a new soap for the millennium (and I bet that was in everyone's proposals) often means the conciliation of the seemingly contradictory. It has to be young, but not frighten off the grannies. It can be metropolitan, but can't alienate the regions. Not too gritty, not too fluffy, not too... etc, etc. It could all be so daunting, but what no commissioner - ITV or BBC - wants is some sitting-on-the-fence compromise. You may trim, but ultimately you have to go with your gut and what you believe in. So while we bid a reluctant farewell to the notion of the pink Cadillac carwash (too bubblegummy) and our Big Issue seller (too inner-city), we embark with enthusiasm on the little task of writing three pilot scripts and 65 storylines to prove our instinct right.

The two political opponents have joined together in a last-ditch effort to prevent the passage of a bill which would cut off funds for the 5,900 US troops in Kosovo by July 1 2001, and which observers believe was on the verge of winning majority support in the Republican-controlled Senate. The bill, jointly sponsored by the Republican armed services committee chairman, Senator John Warner, and the veteran Democrat Senator Robert Byrd, would pull the US troops out unless Mr Clinton or his successor obtains congressional approval for continued deployment. The president would also be required to put forward a timetable for the transfer of responsibility for peacekeeping in Kosovo to European nations, and to certify that all Nato countries are paying their share for the operations. The Byrd-Warner bill has been described as \"a de facto pull-out decision by the United States\" by the former Nato supreme commander General Wesley Clark, and is viewed with alarm in most European capitals. Domestic political opposition to the bill has mainly come from Democrats, who are in a minority in the Senate, and from Republican Senator John McCain, who warned this week that the bill would \"send the message to Nato that the United States is an unreliable ally\".

The result of 13 years' tortuous planning, the \u00a381m modernist embassy opened by Princess Anne yesterday was hailed as a new gateway between Russia and Britain. The architect who created the building, Richard Burton, admitted that the building's conception had been unusually fraught as a result of radically shifting political circumstances in Russia. His company, Ahrends Burton and Koralek, originally put forward a fortress-like design. This was torn up at the beginning of the 1990s, when embassy officials decided it no longer reflected the post-cold war spirit of relations between the two countries. Instead he was ordered back to the drawing board to design a \"more outgoing\" building - reflected in the airy, transparent new structure. Conveniently, the redesigned plans also halved projected construction costs because of a reduction in expensive security measures. However, the new symbolic openness did not mean a wholesale abandonment of security concerns. The 1985 US embassy debacle had not been forgotten.

We want it to be part of Russia not apart from Russia,\" he said. Mr Burton agreed. \"The building isn't monolithic. It's broken up into four parts. It's transparent - there's air and light going through the four buildings. It's meant to look welcoming.\" Russian architectural commentators are not convinced. Some have raised eyebrows at the building's chalet-style timber balconies and open-air walkways, questioning how much use they will be when temperatures drop to -30C. \"It looks a bit like a spa or a health resort. It's as if the building was designed not to stand on the banks of the Moscow river, but on the shores of a Pacific ocean resort,\" said Grigory Revzin, a writer on architecture. Nevertheless the attempt to dispense with the stiff formality of the old embassy - a 19th century palace overlooking the Kremlin - is impossible to ignore. The old building, now used exclusively as the ambassador's residence, was filled with chandeliers, mahogany panelling and lifesize portraits of past and present royals. The walls of the new building have been hung with modern art, some by artists who appeared in the provocative Sensation exhibition at the Royal Academy. A huge sofa in the shape of a pair of lips stands in the entrance hall. Just a month after Vladimir Putin's controversial meeting with the Queen in London, the Princess Royal was received by Mr Putin in the Kremlin on Tuesday - a further demonstration of Britain's determination to embrace the new Russian president, despite international concern about human rights violations during the prosecution of the war in Chechnya. This approach was underlined by Mr Cook, making his second visit to Moscow this year; he spent the afternoon in talks with Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov.",

New figures released by the government this week show the number of single women over the age of 65 is at a record low - 6% compared with over 10% in 1980.

No more reclusive spinster novelists, beavering away in the parlour like Emily Bront\u00eb or Jane Austen? Even if she did not secretly aspire to fame, the maiden aunt was, for many families, a godsend. She was willing to look after nephews and nieces, step in when parents were unwell and display the endless patience that comes more easily - in theory - to those who have not had children themselves.</p> <p>But what about the maiden aunt herself? Was she really content with her lot? On the whole, no one bothered to inquire and even when Agatha Christie turned a maiden aunt into a central character, she could not avoid investing her with stereotypical character traits.</p> <p>Miss Marple is brighter than her neighbours give her credit for, but only because she has never really had a life of her own. Her wisdom comes from observing other people, making her a nice version of another female stereotype, the nosy spinster. She is unexpectedly tolerant of other people's passions, but that is because Christie expected her readers to assume that all unmarried women were sexually inexperienced - and quite possibly frustrated to boot.</p> <p>This is an increasingly dodgy expectation, as a seventysomething friend of mine attests. Never married, without children of her own, she is a classic maiden aunt, doted on by younger members of her family. Yet she has had a positively racy life, remaining single from choice and not regretting her lack of children for a moment. Nor is she remotely defensive, like two older single women I once met in an English village. \"We live together,\" one told me, within minutes of being introduced, \"but we're not lesbians.\"</p> <p>What this reflects is years of fending off other people's assumptions, including the notion that unmarried women of a certain age must have been \"left on the shelf\". What the new population figures seem to reflect is a change in the expectations of women themselves, with many marrying for the first time at an age when an earlier generation had settled into reluctant - or so we assumed - spinsterhood.</p> <p>This was only one of the cruel assumptions that used to be routinely made about older women who had not married. One of the kinder ones was that their fianc\u00e9s had died \"in the war\" and they had subsequently dedicated themselves to siblings' offspring or found surrogate children by becoming teachers. At the school I attended, we wrote this script for any unmarried schoolmistress, romantically imagining a handsome young subaltern who had died in the trenches in the first world war.</p> <p>It was only much later that we realised most of our teachers were not even born when that conflict ended. But we still assumed they could not be spinsters or even career women by choice. The most common attitudes to older single women were pity and condescension, as though they had missed out on life's most important experiences. It is true that there have been times, including the period after the first world war, when single women outnumbered single men and it was not possible for every woman to find a husband. But it is also the case that some women prefer not to marry, though that certainly does not mean they have never had sex.</p> <p>With so many women choosing to cohabit these days, it is quite possible that the number of never-married over-65s will start to rise again. Single women with children and grandchildren, and two or three ex-lovers, are hardly going to be maiden aunt material when they reach their 70s.

He was a literature student with a part-time job.

      "body": "<p> If you have a website, why have just one feather in your cap when you can have a hundred? Look around the web and there is a plethora of awards all waiting to be won. Flashily designed icons ranging from family honours to cool pet site prizes are there for the taking - for in most cases you just need to apply.</p> <p> The list is almost endless... the Surreal Website award, Duke of URL Classy Site award, Bonnie and Rex's Radical award, the Zilinsky Family award, Cyber Teddy People's Choice top 500 award, Lisa/Lothy/Judy's creative site award. </p> <p> Then there are those which cost - they redesign the web page for a fee, before you apply for their award. The <a href=\"http://www.webby.com\" target=\"_new\">Webby awards</a> in the US, held last week in San Francisco, and the <a href=\"http://www.yell.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Yell UK awards</a> - due in July - might have prestige, but they are only two in the sea of icons with which you can embellish your site. So can anyone give anyone an award in the cyber world? The answer is obviously yes. Why issue them? Because the more awards you hand out, the more web pages will link back to your own. </p> <p> But surprisingly, there are a few website builders who have benefited from it all. Dr Vijay Prakash, a resident of Lucknow in north India, swears by the awards which have made him an instant net celebrity. His site Guide to Home Remedies and First Aid <a href=\"http://dr-vijayprakash.hypermart.net\" target=\"_new\">http://dr-vijayprakash.hypermart.net</a> has won him no fewer than 80 awards within a year. Up to 40 emailed queries are sent to him from all over the world each day, ranging from people worrying about snakebites to those looking for long-term asthma cures. He answers them all free, sometimes issuing \"dadima ke nuskhe\" - ancient herbal remedies passed down generations.</p> <p> The fame which the paediatrician could never earn even after practising for 14 years in his hometown is now his after just a few months on the web. \"These awards help in getting publicity. Earlier I used to apply to go to international conferences, now I get invitations to attend the same,\" says Dr Prakash. \"They also agree to pay for the air fare,\" he adds, laughing. </p> <p>'Money is secondary - the response which I have got in the last few months is mindboggling. I also keep getting emails from expatriate Indians from all over the world who chance upon my site and are proud to see that I have bagged so many honours.\" </p> <p> Although he was the site of the month on AOL last October, he says his biggest recognition is the link provided to his site by the prestigious Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, USA. For someone like Phil Barnett, a Cheshire bird watcher and winner of 1999 Yell best personal site and site of the year awards for his <a href=\"http://abcissa.co.uk/birds/\" target=\"_new\">Birds in a Cheshire Garden</a>, his dual feat has not only made him famous overnight, but given him a career. \"I had been suffering from ME and had been on a wheelchair for 10 years. Unable to do anything I used to keep watching birds in my garden,\" explains Barnett. \"When my condition improved I bought myself a computer in 1997, got an internet connection and started designing web pages on my subject - birds.</p> <p> \"After getting the best personal site award I was shocked when my name was announced for the best site of the year award,\" says the self-taught web designer.

      "bodyText": "If you have a website, why have just one feather in your cap when you can have a hundred? Look around the web and there is a plethora of awards all waiting to be won. Flashily designed icons ranging from family honours to cool pet site prizes are there for the taking - for in most cases you just need to apply. The list is almost endless... the Surreal Website award, Duke of URL Classy Site award, Bonnie and Rex's Radical award, the Zilinsky Family award, Cyber Teddy People's Choice top 500 award, Lisa/Lothy/Judy's creative site award. Then there are those which cost - they redesign the web page for a fee, before you apply for their award. The Webby awards in the US, held last week in San Francisco, and the Yell UK awards - due in July - might have prestige, but they are only two in the sea of icons with which you can embellish your site. So can anyone give anyone an award in the cyber world? The answer is obviously yes. Why issue them? Because the more awards you hand out, the more web pages will link back to your own. But surprisingly, there are a few website builders who have benefited from it all. Dr Vijay Prakash, a resident of Lucknow in north India, swears by the awards which have made him an instant net celebrity. His site Guide to Home Remedies and First Aid http://dr-vijayprakash.hypermart.net has won him no fewer than 80 awards within a year. Up to 40 emailed queries are sent to him from all over the world each day, ranging from people worrying about snakebites to those looking for long-term asthma cures. He answers them all free, sometimes issuing \"dadima ke nuskhe\" - ancient herbal remedies passed down generations. The fame which the paediatrician could never earn even after practising for 14 years in his hometown is now his after just a few months on the web. \"These awards help in getting publicity. Earlier I used to apply to go to international conferences, now I get invitations to attend the same,\" says Dr Prakash. \"They also agree to pay for the air fare,\" he adds, laughing. 'Money is secondary - the response which I have got in the last few months is mindboggling. I also keep getting emails from expatriate Indians from all over the world who chance upon my site and are proud to see that I have bagged so many honours.\" Although he was the site of the month on AOL last October, he says his biggest recognition is the link provided to his site by the prestigious Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, USA. For someone like Phil Barnett, a Cheshire bird watcher and winner of 1999 Yell best personal site and site of the year awards for his Birds in a Cheshire Garden, his dual feat has not only made him famous overnight, but given him a career. \"I had been suffering from ME and had been on a wheelchair for 10 years. Unable to do anything I used to keep watching birds in my garden,\" explains Barnett. \"When my condition improved I bought myself a computer in 1997, got an internet connection and started designing web pages on my subject - birds. \"After getting the best personal site award I was shocked when my name was announced for the best site of the year award,\" says the self-taught web designer. He has now opened his own web designing agency with a small, but growing, nationwide clientele. Barnett says that most web site awards are meaningless, but serve a purpose as another link in the web. \"One has to separate the wheat from the chaff,\" he adds. \"I know of people who have got a hundred awards for sites which are not the least good.\" But the popularity of the big awards keeps growing. Nigel Marson, marketing communications controller at yell.com says nominations have increased by 25% this year. \"There are new categories this year for small business, which also include nominations from people like plumbers and antique dealers,\" he says. Insisting that it is not just hits but the merit of the sites which bags them the awards, he cautiously declines to comment on the thousands of other little known prizes. But for all those who get the honours just for asking, the prestige and origins of the award probably don't matter - they just want another icon to decorate their page.",

Outrage of day Former maverick Labour MP Ron Brown threatened legal action after he was wrongly dubbed gay in Peter Hitchens's new book The Abolition of Britain. It appears the Daily Express columnist confused \"Red Ron\" with agriculture minister Nick Brown, who is gay. \"I've been wrongly labelled a lot of things in the past, from KGB spy to Gadafy's friend,\" said the leftwinger, deselected in 1992. \"It is not that I have anything against gays, it is just that I am not one.\" Today Commons: Care standards bill, second reading.

A catalogue of more than \u00a382m of \"basic, essential repairs\" was presented to Tony Blair in an open letter shot through with frustration at year after year of government failure to find money for urgent capital work on schools. The petition highlights the plight of comprehensives in the prime minister's own constituency of Sedgefield, where staff face budget sums which cannot be balanced. Woodham community technology college, which would probably school the young Blairs if their nearby Trimdon Colliery house was the family's main home, has been given \u00a324,314 this year for urgent capital repairs which Durham county council has costed at \u00a31,755,215. The school, which offers Japanese and philosophy and is popular locally, lives in fear of a repeat of an incident in 1997 when plate glass crashed out of rotting window frames and 500 students had to be sent home. The crisis at Woodham is consistent across the county, according to the heads, who say they are \"increasingly frustrated and angry about the enormity of the problem\". The letter says that patchwork funding under the government's New Deal, and one-off payments to test the possibility of bypassing local education authorities and funding schools directly, have failed to approach the root of the decay. The heads describe the state of Durham high school buildings as \"dreadful\", with \u00a332.4m of the repair bill graded as urgent - a category where health and safety law will soon require the closure of buildings. Just 40 of 1,000 bids for capital work were approved by the county for submission to the government this year. Steven Harness, headteacher at Woodham, where Mr Blair launched Labour's pro-Europe campaign last year via an IT link-up with a partner school at Breisach in Germany, had to divert \u00a312,000 of the school's ordinary budget to fix the heating system that had not been overhauled since the school opened in 1970. It is a similar juggling act in all 36 schools that lies at the heart of the repairs problem, he said. \"We certainly have a sense of the government wanting to get resources into education, and we have done well through particular schemes like the New Deal and bidding for technology status,\" he said. \"But the core problem, the failure to budget year after year for teachers' salary increases, is simply not being faced.\" Woodham's regular shortfall - last year only 1.4% of a 2.9% pay rise - was funded with inevitable attrition on all other parts of the school budget.

A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Blair would respond in detail to the letter but promised \"lots more to come\" to deal with capital repairs. He said: \"We are facing a huge backlog of work right across the country, which has built up over the last 20 years and which is not possible to turn around overnight. \"We are spending \u00a36bn on schools capital projects over this parliament, which is twice as much as the previous government. \"In County Durham, schools have had over \u00a324m for capital projects in the last two years.

      "body": "<p>Almost one in 10 children have stopped using reference books and are relying on electronic sources - chiefly the internet - to get their information, according to the fullest study of national reading habits.</p> <p>The report offers the first statistical evidence that a new generation of children growing up in the microchip era has markedly different attitudes to acquiring knowledge from those of their parents.</p> <p>By the age of five, a small minority of them (about 15%) has started looking things up on the net or CD-roms. By the age of 15, some 58% of them are using these sources - only 2% fewer than those looking up non-fiction books.</p> <p>After the peak age of 15, use of the net or disks for reference falls sharply and books become more popular. The report, funded by the Library and Information Commission, finds that most children and youngsters still use books as well as electronic access.</p> <p>But it adds: \"As many as 9% of children use electronic sources exclusively for obtaining reference information. They don't use books for this purpose.\"</p> <p>A smaller minority of children - about 2% - told researchers that they were reading less than before because they \"used computers or CD-roms or the internet more\".</p> <p>The 180-page study indicates that the old habit of reading books continues to flourish - despite all counter attractions - as by far the biggest single cultural pastime in Britain.</p> <p>It has withstood 40 years of mass television viewing and other social and educational changes. Around 80% of adults say they read books for pleasure for an average of five and a half hours a week, the equivalent of 47 minutes a day.

      "bodyText": "Almost one in 10 children have stopped using reference books and are relying on electronic sources - chiefly the internet - to get their information, according to the fullest study of national reading habits. The report offers the first statistical evidence that a new generation of children growing up in the microchip era has markedly different attitudes to acquiring knowledge from those of their parents. By the age of five, a small minority of them (about 15%) has started looking things up on the net or CD-roms. By the age of 15, some 58% of them are using these sources - only 2% fewer than those looking up non-fiction books. After the peak age of 15, use of the net or disks for reference falls sharply and books become more popular. The report, funded by the Library and Information Commission, finds that most children and youngsters still use books as well as electronic access. But it adds: \"As many as 9% of children use electronic sources exclusively for obtaining reference information. They don't use books for this purpose.\" A smaller minority of children - about 2% - told researchers that they were reading less than before because they \"used computers or CD-roms or the internet more\". The 180-page study indicates that the old habit of reading books continues to flourish - despite all counter attractions - as by far the biggest single cultural pastime in Britain. It has withstood 40 years of mass television viewing and other social and educational changes. Around 80% of adults say they read books for pleasure for an average of five and a half hours a week, the equivalent of 47 minutes a day. For 15%, this rises to \"at least\" 11 hours a week. Lack of time - not, so far, the internet - emerges as the biggest overall enemy of the reading habit. It was cited as a reason by nearly half of non-frequent readers. Only 8% of these mentioned the net or home computers as a distraction. Liz Attenborough, consultant to the National Year of Reading, said: \"I'm not unduly worried about the number of children relying exclusively on the net. \"You have to have a quite sophisticated level of reading to find your way around it. Its information can be highly inaccurate. But it can also be much more fashionable, more up to date and more appealing to someone used to computer games.\" The survey into the reading of 1,700 adults and 700 children, is by the Reading Partnership, an Arts Council funded group which promotes literature in public libraries, and the research group Book Marketing. It found seven people in every 10 read a book at least once a week. Fiction emerged as the favourite for 60% of adults and 70% of children, though non-fiction takes over in popularity among older people. Two thirds of adults told researchers they read books \"to get information and find things out\". Just over half also use them \"to relax or relieve stress\", 27% \"to escape\" and 24% \"as a chance to use the imagination\". Gender-based differences in reading taste emerge among the youngest children. Some 63% of girls, but only 37% of boys, read poetry and nursery rhymes. Women are far more likely than men to discuss books with other women and to accept reading recommendations from them. \u0095 A search was launched yesterday to find Britain's favourite word.

The havoc might be even worse than that caused by the recent \"Love Bug\" virus attack, warn experts. Mobile phone viruses could record conversations and forward them to others, delete money from \"electronic wallets\", or rack up huge telephone bills. Computer viruses attack programmable devices and spread when there is a link between one device and another. Early viruses spread mainly via infected computer discs handed from user to user. Today e-mail provides a quicker and more expansive route of infection, as was so clearly demonstrated by the \"ILOVEYOU\" virus. The easier communication becomes, the more damage can be inflicted by viruses. Charles Palmer, a specialist in network security and cryptography research at IBM, told New Scientist magazine: \"The thing that makes viruses a threat is that we're so well connected.\" This suggested a huge potential for viruses to spread via current and next generation \"WAP\" phones and personal organisers. The danger was bound to increase as mobile phones became more sophisticated and programmable, and designers were under pressure to add ever-increasing numbers of functions. The most common way for viruses to strike is when an e-mail attachment is opened which then triggers other applications. In the case of a \"WAP\" phone, the viruses could dial out, start recording software for personal surveillance, or wipe out the contents of files such as electronic wallets. Avi Ruben, a specialist in Internet security at the AT&amp;T laboratories in Florham Park, New Jersey, in the United States, said: \"If somebody sends you a telephone number by e-mail, you want to be able to click on that number to dial it.

The ruling was no surprise: the company was clearly storing and offering copyrighted music from its own servers. But it has forced providers of content - text, sound, software and art - to take more seriously rules regarding reproducing material on the internet. </p> <p>The decision did not address the music industry's problem with Napster, the program that allows millions of users to share copyrighted music files. Since it launched last year, controversy over the program has been building as quickly as its user base, now in the millions. </p> <p>Not only is the music industry trying to shut down Napster with a series of lawsuits alleging copyright infringement, but the service has also become the first instance of digital distribution to pit musicians directly against their fans. </p> <p>At the forefront of the battle against Napster is the heavy metal supergroup Metallica. Two weeks ago, members of the group - one that ironically began its career encouraging fans to duplicate its music on cassette - delivered 30 cardboard boxes to Napster's San Mateo headquarters containing the names of 335, 000 people who had downloaded Metallica songs using the service. </p> <p>Howard King, a lawyer for the group, said the names were gleaned by monitoring the site and demanded Napster stop them using the service. Napster's lawyers argued that it is merely an internet service provider, or conduit, and not liable for piracy by its users. But under law it is obligated to bar users if they are proven to have infringed copyright - which it has. </p> <p>However, since the actual names of the users weren't gathered - only their service log-ons - those banned were able to re-register using a different name and resume trafficking. </p> <p>The band's action was only latest episode in its crusade against Napster. Last month a threatened suit against the universities of Yale and Indiana forced the administrators to block the service from its servers. </p> <p>Metallica, joined by rapper Dr Dre, alleged the universities allowed trade of copyrighted songs to flourish by failing to block access to the Napster. </p> <p>\"We take our craft - whether it be the music, the lyrics, or the photos and artwork - very seriously, as do most artists,\" Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich said in a statement. \"It is therefore sickening to know that our art is being traded like a commodity rather than the art that it is.\" </p> <p>The group's stand has angered many fans, many of whom point out the apparent conflict between preaching rebellion and resistance to the system on the one hand and being a visible advocate for it on the other. \"I am purposely going to download their entire next album from Napster for spite, remarked one aggrieved fan.\" </p> <p>Of course, other, younger, bands see the controversy as an opportunity. </p> <p>Limp Biskit, a rap-metal band sponsored by Napster, criticised fellow artists who have accused Napster of promoting music piracy. \"I would think the only people worried about that are people that are really worried about their bank accounts,\" said singer Fred Durst. </p> <p>The publicity surrounding MP3.com and Napster has led to dramatic surges in online traffic. During the week that Metallica and Dr Dre sued Napster, the company experienced a 20% jump in visitors to its web site.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Hyperstar lives up to its hype<br> Starlancer</strong> PC CD-rom<br> \u00a334.99 Digital Anvil/Microsoft ***** <br> Developed by the creators of Wing Commander, financed by the richest company in the world, surrounded by the biggest cloud of hype since Star Wars Episode I - it would be a strange old universe if Starlancer was anything but a disappointment. </p> <p>Disappointingly, though, it's great. Indeed, in terms of visuals, it may be the single most impressive game yet. The stunning title sequence isn't so unusual: the surprise is that the in-game graphics are almost as good. </p> <p>With moving parts on the ships, blazing guns, and shields that glow when hit, the level of detail is awe-inspiring. And if you happen to round on the sun during a dogfight, you may forget to breathe, never mind deploy electronic countermeasures. </p> <p>And don't worry about your ears feeling left out. The orchestral music is both ominous and uplifting, and the sound effects are top-notch, although this may be because they were lifted wholesale from Star Wars. No complaints either about the interface, which, despite offering you too many options (is anyone really going to remember to divert all power to shields when someone' s on their tail?), is relatively easy to pick up. </p> <p>Real thought has gone into the multiplayer modes, too. Head-to-head action in the space combat genre usually means a mindless free-for-all, but here there's a wide and varied range of options, for co-operators and deathmatch psychos alike. </p> <p>As far as solo play goes, you know the drill. Missions of various styles, briefings, ship upgrades later in the game. The storyline, if a little predictable - a traitor in our midst? Stone me - is not just developed between missions, but neatly integrated into the action. </p> <p>The only glaring flaw is the corny-as-oats premise, which sees the west still slugging it out with the east 180 years in the future. Sure, it could happen, but some imagination (not to say optimism) wouldn't have gone amiss. </p> <p>Still, as any film producer will tell you, war is not about right and wrong. War is about glory, shooting things, and spectacular explosions. And on that front, Starlancer is light-years ahead. (AB) </p> <p><strong>Sneaking with the Snake<br> Metal Gear Solid </strong> Game Boy Color<br> \u00a324.99 Konami/Nintendo **** <br> Metal Gear Solid made \"stealth\" gaming famous: instead of hacking or blasting your way through platoons of canon fodder, the idea is to sneak through the game killing as few enemies as possible. </p> <p>This aspect proved easy to transfer to the Game Boy Color. But MGS was also one of the first to conjure up a cinematic sort of atmosphere, and it requires a considerable act of charity to say the same. </p> <p>It's not that the graphics and sound are bad, just that the Game Boy's primitive colour screen and warbling beeps really aren't up to the job. </p> <p>Still, you get a lot of game for the money. There's the excellent VR training system - also used for a two-player version of the game - plus 13 levels to sneak through. </p> <p>Although different from the Sony PlayStation version, the plot is similar, and MGS fans will feel at home. You play Solid Snake, brought out of semi-retirement to infiltrate the enemy base where a stolen bipedal war machine, Metal Gear, is hidden. The idea that you've done all this before is built in to the game. </p> <p>But Konami has tried to make the game accessible to newcomers - at least, if they remember to use the Codec communications device to contact Mei Ling and others back at command HQ. </p> <p>The four difficulty levels, from Easy to Very Hard, also give younger and older players a chance to get through most levels, though it has to be said that Easy is a relative concept. With more than speed and brute force being required to complete the game, I suspect that even the 12-15s are going to find it a challenge. (JS)</p> <p><strong>Kicking the same old idea around</strong></p> <p><strong> Euro 2000</strong> Sony PlayStation</p> <p> \u00a334.99 EA Sports ** <br> Like Southampton avoiding relegation and England bowing out on penalties, some things in football seem inevitable. Take the Fifa series for example. Come hell, high water or the Stockton U16 5-a-side championship, there will always be a Fifa footy game alongside. </p> <p>The forthcoming Euro 2000 tournament is yet another excuse for an update. But International Superstar Soccer Pro Evolution (ISS Pro) was released earlier this year and suddenly the goalposts have moved. </p> <p>No more must silicon footie fans put up with delayed passes, players skating over the pitch or 8-7 scorelines. ISS made you think like a footballer, with the act of scoring as difficult, but as rewarding, as the real thing. Euro 2000, however, makes scoring as easy as pressing the circle button and as memorable as a basketball dunk. </p> <p>Never mind patient build-ups and defence splitting through balls; let's just sprint through the opposing team before lashing in yet another scorcher_ and another, and another. But Euro 2000 does have some redeeming features. </p> <p>You can faithfully recreate this summer's tournament, including the qualifying stages, and all the players and stadiums are accurate. The pumping Paul Oakenfold soundtrack is aggressively energising, and you can even replay classic encounters of old - including the '96 England Germany semi-final. </p> <p>But as usual, this window dressing does little to improve the shortcomings on the pitch. With Hoddle's rejuvenated Saints set to threaten next season's top 10 and England not even practising penalties, it seems football is moving on. It's time the Fifa series did too. (GH)</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hyperstar lives up to its hype Starlancer PC CD-rom \u00a334.99 Digital Anvil/Microsoft ***** Developed by the creators of Wing Commander, financed by the richest company in the world, surrounded by the biggest cloud of hype since Star Wars Episode I - it would be a strange old universe if Starlancer was anything but a disappointment. Disappointingly, though, it's great. Indeed, in terms of visuals, it may be the single most impressive game yet. The stunning title sequence isn't so unusual: the surprise is that the in-game graphics are almost as good. With moving parts on the ships, blazing guns, and shields that glow when hit, the level of detail is awe-inspiring. And if you happen to round on the sun during a dogfight, you may forget to breathe, never mind deploy electronic countermeasures. And don't worry about your ears feeling left out. The orchestral music is both ominous and uplifting, and the sound effects are top-notch, although this may be because they were lifted wholesale from Star Wars. No complaints either about the interface, which, despite offering you too many options (is anyone really going to remember to divert all power to shields when someone' s on their tail?), is relatively easy to pick up. Real thought has gone into the multiplayer modes, too. Head-to-head action in the space combat genre usually means a mindless free-for-all, but here there's a wide and varied range of options, for co-operators and deathmatch psychos alike. As far as solo play goes, you know the drill. Missions of various styles, briefings, ship upgrades later in the game. The storyline, if a little predictable - a traitor in our midst? Stone me - is not just developed between missions, but neatly integrated into the action. The only glaring flaw is the corny-as-oats premise, which sees the west still slugging it out with the east 180 years in the future. Sure, it could happen, but some imagination (not to say optimism) wouldn't have gone amiss. Still, as any film producer will tell you, war is not about right and wrong. War is about glory, shooting things, and spectacular explosions. And on that front, Starlancer is light-years ahead. (AB) Sneaking with the Snake Metal Gear Solid Game Boy Color \u00a324.99 Konami/Nintendo **** Metal Gear Solid made \"stealth\" gaming famous: instead of hacking or blasting your way through platoons of canon fodder, the idea is to sneak through the game killing as few enemies as possible. This aspect proved easy to transfer to the Game Boy Color. But MGS was also one of the first to conjure up a cinematic sort of atmosphere, and it requires a considerable act of charity to say the same. It's not that the graphics and sound are bad, just that the Game Boy's primitive colour screen and warbling beeps really aren't up to the job. Still, you get a lot of game for the money. There's the excellent VR training system - also used for a two-player version of the game - plus 13 levels to sneak through. Although different from the Sony PlayStation version, the plot is similar, and MGS fans will feel at home. You play Solid Snake, brought out of semi-retirement to infiltrate the enemy base where a stolen bipedal war machine, Metal Gear, is hidden. The idea that you've done all this before is built in to the game. But Konami has tried to make the game accessible to newcomers - at least, if they remember to use the Codec communications device to contact Mei Ling and others back at command HQ. The four difficulty levels, from Easy to Very Hard, also give younger and older players a chance to get through most levels, though it has to be said that Easy is a relative concept. With more than speed and brute force being required to complete the game, I suspect that even the 12-15s are going to find it a challenge. (JS) Kicking the same old idea around Euro 2000 Sony PlayStation \u00a334.99 EA Sports ** Like Southampton avoiding relegation and England bowing out on penalties, some things in football seem inevitable. Take the Fifa series for example. Come hell, high water or the Stockton U16 5-a-side championship, there will always be a Fifa footy game alongside. The forthcoming Euro 2000 tournament is yet another excuse for an update. But International Superstar Soccer Pro Evolution (ISS Pro) was released earlier this year and suddenly the goalposts have moved. No more must silicon footie fans put up with delayed passes, players skating over the pitch or 8-7 scorelines. ISS made you think like a footballer, with the act of scoring as difficult, but as rewarding, as the real thing. Euro 2000, however, makes scoring as easy as pressing the circle button and as memorable as a basketball dunk. Never mind patient build-ups and defence splitting through balls; let's just sprint through the opposing team before lashing in yet another scorcher_ and another, and another. But Euro 2000 does have some redeeming features. You can faithfully recreate this summer's tournament, including the qualifying stages, and all the players and stadiums are accurate. The pumping Paul Oakenfold soundtrack is aggressively energising, and you can even replay classic encounters of old - including the '96 England Germany semi-final. But as usual, this window dressing does little to improve the shortcomings on the pitch. With Hoddle's rejuvenated Saints set to threaten next season's top 10 and England not even practising penalties, it seems football is moving on. It's time the Fifa series did too. (GH)",

      "byline": "Jack Schofield",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> X off</strong><br> Apple has just delayed the release of its next generation operating system, Mac OS X (pronounced \"ten\") by about six months. Or as Apple boss Steve Jobs says, it has changed what would have been a summer launch into a \"public beta\" release. \"Like a lot of things in life, you can do what you were going to do but change the names of things to make a lot of people happy,\" Jobs said. Mac OS X is a version of BSD Unix, and needs a G3 or G4 processor and 64 megabytes of memory. It is based on the NextStep operating system, created by Next, Jobs' former company. Apple bought Next at the end of 1996 to provide a faster way of replacing the ageing Mac OS. </p> <p><strong> Out of the box</strong><br> Electronic Arts, the world's biggest independent computer and video games software supplier, has had enough of shipping PC games in big boxes that are mostly empty. It has decided to switch to the cases used for DVD movies, This will save publishers money and enable retailers to make better use of shelf space, argues EA. It's also looking forward to the time when Sony PlayStation 2 and other games consoles will play DVD movies, and it hopes other games houses will follow its lead. </p> <p>\"EA has a long tradition of teaching the interactive entertainment sector to think outside the box,\" quips Frank Sagnier, the marketing boss of EA Europe. EA games should start appearing in DVD cases in October. </p> <p><strong> Nic's back</strong><br> Oracle boss Larry Ellison, on course to become the world's richest man, is trying to give the kiss of life to his failed Network Computer idea. His first network computer company, Network Computer Inc (NIC) took a different tack when - like many other firms - it found that network computers didn't sell: it changed its name to Liberate and switched successfully to interactive TV. Now Ellison has founded New Internet Computer (NIC) with what looks like the old logo. It is being run by a former ABC-TV technology journalist, Gina Smith. NIC's 266MHz $199 NC will not have a hard drive, monitor, keyboard or speakers but will run the GNU/Linux operating system and a browser from CD-rom. It's intended to provide access to email and the internet: \"We're not positioning this as a replacement for the PC,\" Smith says. As usual, the problem is that by the time you've added the missing bits, the cost - $376 - is not far off a cheap PC. NIC has launched a website at <a href=\"http://www.thinknic.com\">www.thinknic.com</a>. </p> <p><strong> See through</strong><br> If the transparent Game Boy is no longer delivering the street cred you need, Pioneer's PDV-10-SW portable DVD player may do the trick.

      "bodyText": "X off Apple has just delayed the release of its next generation operating system, Mac OS X (pronounced \"ten\") by about six months. Or as Apple boss Steve Jobs says, it has changed what would have been a summer launch into a \"public beta\" release. \"Like a lot of things in life, you can do what you were going to do but change the names of things to make a lot of people happy,\" Jobs said. Mac OS X is a version of BSD Unix, and needs a G3 or G4 processor and 64 megabytes of memory. It is based on the NextStep operating system, created by Next, Jobs' former company. Apple bought Next at the end of 1996 to provide a faster way of replacing the ageing Mac OS. Out of the box Electronic Arts, the world's biggest independent computer and video games software supplier, has had enough of shipping PC games in big boxes that are mostly empty. It has decided to switch to the cases used for DVD movies, This will save publishers money and enable retailers to make better use of shelf space, argues EA. It's also looking forward to the time when Sony PlayStation 2 and other games consoles will play DVD movies, and it hopes other games houses will follow its lead. \"EA has a long tradition of teaching the interactive entertainment sector to think outside the box,\" quips Frank Sagnier, the marketing boss of EA Europe. EA games should start appearing in DVD cases in October. Nic's back Oracle boss Larry Ellison, on course to become the world's richest man, is trying to give the kiss of life to his failed Network Computer idea. His first network computer company, Network Computer Inc (NIC) took a different tack when - like many other firms - it found that network computers didn't sell: it changed its name to Liberate and switched successfully to interactive TV. Now Ellison has founded New Internet Computer (NIC) with what looks like the old logo. It is being run by a former ABC-TV technology journalist, Gina Smith. NIC's 266MHz $199 NC will not have a hard drive, monitor, keyboard or speakers but will run the GNU/Linux operating system and a browser from CD-rom. It's intended to provide access to email and the internet: \"We're not positioning this as a replacement for the PC,\" Smith says. As usual, the problem is that by the time you've added the missing bits, the cost - $376 - is not far off a cheap PC. NIC has launched a website at www.thinknic.com. See through If the transparent Game Boy is no longer delivering the street cred you need, Pioneer's PDV-10-SW portable DVD player may do the trick.

      "body": "<p><strong> What is iD Solutions? </strong> iD Solutions is a group dedicated to the document domain. When people say document management, even in IT-literate circles, some people immediately think of archiving, storage and imaging systems. Others might think of it as document content management - looking after huge libraries of information and tracking the change to it. The third group is what I would call document generation. That's the consistent high-quality production of statements, insurance policies or correspondence. It's in this last area that Cincom's iD Solutions is strong. </p> <p>We're into large-scale, generally interactive, document generation. With the term \"document\" being used to describe the process and the content creation rather than the delivery mechanism. </p> <p><strong> How do the UK's IT and internet skills compare with other countries?</strong> We are so risk averse. Obviously Cincom's based in the US, which is a very exciting environment, but in the UK it's amazing how many Australian software companies you come across. Statistically there may not actually be that many but it appears that they're more prepared to take a risk. </p> <p><strong> How do you feel major corporations are adapting to e-commerce?</strong> What we see is the large companies plucking one person from here and one from there then whacking them into a new office and saying \"go do it\". It's easier to do that than it is to tell the whole organisation to give these people freedom to change the way in which that company does business.

      "bodyText": "What is iD Solutions? iD Solutions is a group dedicated to the document domain. When people say document management, even in IT-literate circles, some people immediately think of archiving, storage and imaging systems. Others might think of it as document content management - looking after huge libraries of information and tracking the change to it. The third group is what I would call document generation. That's the consistent high-quality production of statements, insurance policies or correspondence. It's in this last area that Cincom's iD Solutions is strong. We're into large-scale, generally interactive, document generation. With the term \"document\" being used to describe the process and the content creation rather than the delivery mechanism. How do the UK's IT and internet skills compare with other countries? We are so risk averse. Obviously Cincom's based in the US, which is a very exciting environment, but in the UK it's amazing how many Australian software companies you come across. Statistically there may not actually be that many but it appears that they're more prepared to take a risk. How do you feel major corporations are adapting to e-commerce? What we see is the large companies plucking one person from here and one from there then whacking them into a new office and saying \"go do it\". It's easier to do that than it is to tell the whole organisation to give these people freedom to change the way in which that company does business. It does, however, mean that those people are re-inventing a hell of a lot of wheels! Is there real money being made from e-commerce? Absolutely. The example I always give is the penetration of mobile phones - Finland now has 86% of over 14 year olds with a mobile phone.The level of penetration of e-commerce is going to go the same way ... whatever prediction people make, just double it.

      "body": "<p>Like millions of other people around the world, I have been fascinated to hear five eminent speakers share with us their thoughts, hopes and fears about sustainable development, based on their own experience.</p> <p>All five of those contributions have been immensely thoughtful and challenging. There have been clear differences - of opinion and of emphasis - between the speakers, but there have also been some important common themes - both implicit and explicit.</p> <p>One of those themes has been the suggestion that sustainable development is a matter of enlightened self-interest. Two of the speakers used this phrase, and I don't believe that the other three would dissent from it - and nor would I.</p> <p>Self-interest is a powerful motivating force for all of us, and if we can somehow convince ourselves that sustainable development is in all our interests then we will have taken a valuable first step towards achieving it.</p> <p>But self-interest comes in many competing guises, not all of which - I fear - are likely to lead in the right direction for very long, nor to embrace the manifold needs of future generations. I am convinced we will need to dig rather deeper to find the inspiration, sense of urgency and moral purpose required to confront the hard choices which face us on the long road to sustainable development. So although it seems to have become deeply unfashionable to talk about the spiritual dimension of our existence, that is what I propose to do.</p> <p>The idea that there is a sacred trust between mankind and our creator, under which we accept a duty of stewardship for the earth, has been an important feature of most religious and spiritual thought throughout the ages. Even those whose beliefs have not included the existence of a creator have, nevertheless, adopted a similar position on moral and ethical grounds. It is only recently that this guiding principle has become smothered by almost impenetrable layers of scientific rationalism.</p> <p>I believe that if we are to achieve genuinely sustainable development we will first have to rediscover, or re-acknowledge, a sense of the sacred in our dealings with the natural world, and with each other. If literally nothing is held sacred any more - because it is considered synonymous with superstition, or in some other way \"irrational\" - what is there to prevent us treating our entire world as some \"great laboratory of life,\" with potentially disastrous long-term consequences?</p> <p>Fundamentally, an understanding of the sacred helps us to acknowledge that there are bounds of balance, order and harmony in the natural world which set limits to our ambitions and define the parameters of sustainable development. In some cases, nature's limits are well understood at the rational, scientific level. As a simple example, we know that trying to graze too many sheep on a hillside will, sooner or later, be counter-productive, for the sheep, the hillside, or both. More widely, we understand that the over-use of insecticides or antibiotics leads to problems of resistance.</p> <p>And we are beginning to comprehend the full, awful consequences of pumping too much carbon dioxide into the earth's atmosphere. Yet the actions being taken to halt the damage known to be caused by exceeding nature's limits in these and other ways are insufficient to ensure a sustainable outcome.</p> <p>In other areas, such as the artificial and uncontained transfer of genes between species of plants and animals, the lack of hard scientific evidence of harmful consequences is regarded, in many quarters, as sufficient reason to allow such developments to proceed. The idea of taking a precautionary approach, in this and many other potentially damaging situations, receives overwhelming public support, but still faces a degree of official opposition, as if admitting the possibility of doubt was a sign of weakness or even of a wish to halt \"progress.\" On the contrary, I believe it to be a sign of strength and of wisdom.</p> <p>It seems that when we do have scientific evidence that we are damaging our environment we aren't doing enough to put things right, and when we don't have that evidence we are prone to do nothing at all, regardless of the risks. Part of the problem is the prevailing approach that seeks to reduce the natural world, including ourselves, to the level of nothing more than a mechanical process. For whilst the natural theologians of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, like Thomas Morgan, referred to \"the perfect unity, order, wisdom and design\" of the natural world, scientists like Bertrand Russell rejected this idea as rubbish. \"I think the universe,\" he wrote, \"is all spots and jumps without unity and without continuity, without coherence or orderliness.\" Sir</p> <p>Julian Huxley wrote in \"Creation: a modern synthesis\" that \"modern science must rule out special creation or divine guidance.\" But why? As Professor Alan Linton of Bristol University has written: \"Evolution is a man-made 'theory' to explain the origin and continuance of life on this planet without reference to a creator.\" It is because of our inability, or refusal, to accept the existence of a guiding hand that nature has come to be regarded as a system that can be engineered for our own convenience, or as a nuisance to be evaded and manipulated, and in which anything that happens can be \"fixed\" by technology and human ingenuity. Fritz Schumacher recognised the inherent dangers in this approach when he said that \"there are two sciences - the science of manipulation and the science of understanding.\"</p> <p>In this technology-driven age it is all too easy for us to forget that mankind is a part of nature, and not apart from it, and that this is why we should seek to work with the grain of nature in everything we do. For the natural world is, as the economist Herman Daly puts it, \"the envelope that contains, sustains and provisions the economy\" - not the other way round. So which argument do you think will win - the living world as one, or the world made up of random parts, the product of mere chance, thereby providing the justification for any kind of development? This, to my mind, lies at the heart of what we call sustainable development.</p> <p>We need, therefore, to rediscover a reverence for the natural world, irrespective of its usefulness to ourselves - to become more aware, in Philip Sherrard's words, of the \"relationship of interdependence, interpenetration and reciprocity between God, man and creation.\" Above all, we should show greater respect for the genius of nature's designs - rigorously tested and refined over millions of years. This means being careful to use science to understand how nature works - not to change what nature is, as we do when genetic manipulation seeks to transform the process of biological evolution into something altogether different. The idea that the different parts of the natural world are connected through an intricate system of checks and balances which we disturb at our peril is all too easily dismissed as no longer relevant. So, in an age when we are told that science has all the answers, what chance is there for working with the grain of nature?</p> <p>As an example of working with the grain of nature, I happen to believe that if a fraction of the money currently being invested in developing genetically manipulated crops were applied to understanding and improving traditional systems of agriculture, which have stood the all-important test of time, the results would be remarkable. There is already plenty of evidence of just what can be achieved through applying more knowledge and fewer chemicals to diverse cropping systems. These are genuinely sustainable methods. And they are far removed from the approaches based on monoculture which lend themselves to large-scale commercial exploitation, and which Vandana Shiva condemned so persuasively and so convincingly in her lecture.</p> <p>Our most eminent scientists accept that there is still a vast amount that we don't know about our world and the life forms that inhabit it. As Sir Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal, points out, it is complexity that makes things hard to understand, not size. In a comment which only an astronomer could make, he describes a butterfly as a more daunting intellectual challenge than the cosmos!</p> <p>Others, like Rachel Carson, have eloquently reminded us that we don't know how to make a single blade of grass. And St Matthew, in his wisdom, emphasised that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as the lilies of the field... Faced with such unknowns, it is hard not to feel a sense of humility, wonder and awe about our place in the natural order. And to feel this at all stems from that inner, heartfelt reason which, sometimes despite ourselves, is telling us that we are intimately bound up in the mysteries of life and that we don't have all the answers. Perhaps, even, that we don't have to have all the answers before knowing what we should do in certain circumstances. As Blaise Pascal wrote in the seventeenth century: \"It is the heart that experiences God, not the reason.\"</p> <p>So do you not feel that, buried deep within each and every one of us, there is an instinctive, heartfelt awareness that provides - if we will allow it to - the most reliable guide as to whether or not our actions are really in the long-term interests of our planet and all the life it supports? This awareness, this wisdom of the heart, may be no more than a faint memory of a distant harmony, rustling like a breeze through the leaves, yet sufficient to remind us that the earth is unique and that we have a duty to care for it.</p> <p>Wisdom, empathy and compassion have no place in the empirical world, yet traditional wisdoms would ask \"without them are we truly human?\" And it would be a good question. It was Socrates who, when asked for his definition of wisdom, gave as his conclusion: \"Knowing that you don't know.\"</p> <p>In suggesting that we will need to listen rather more to the common-sense emanating from our hearts if we are to achieve sustainable development, I am not suggesting that information gained through scientific investigation is anything other than essential. Far from it. But I believe that we need to restore the balance between the heartfelt reason of instinctive wisdom and the rational insights of scientific analysis. Neither, I believe, is much use on its own. So it is only by employing both the intuitive and the rational halves of our own nature - our hearts and our minds - that we will live up to the sacred trust that has been placed in us by our creator - or our \"sustainer,\" as ancient wisdom referred to the creator.</p> <p>As Gro Harlem Brundtland has reminded us, sustainable development is not just about the natural world, but about people, too. This applies whether we are looking at the vast numbers who lack sufficient food or access to clean water, but also those living in poverty and without work. While there is no doubt that globalisation has brought advantages, it brings dangers, too. Without the humility and humanity expressed by Sir John Browne in his notion of the \"connected economy\" - an economy which acknowledges the social and environmental context within which it operates - there is the risk that the poorest and the weakest will not only see very little benefit but, worse, they may find that their livelihoods and cultures have been lost. So, if we are serious about sustainable development, then we must also remember that the lessons of history are particularly relevant when we start to look further ahead. Of course, in an age when it often seems that nothing can properly be regarded as important unless it can be described as \"modern,\" it is highly dangerous to talk about the lessons of the past. And are those lessons ever taught or understood adequately, in an age when to pass on a body of acquired knowledge of this kind is often considered prejudicial to \"progress?\"</p> <p>Of course, our descendants will have scientific and technological expertise beyond our imagining, but will they have the insight or the self-control to use this wisely, having learnt both from our successes and our failures? They won't, I believe, unless there are increased efforts to develop an approach to education which balances the rational with the intuitive. Without this, truly sustainable development is doomed. It will merely become a hollow-sounding mantra that is repeated ad nauseam in order to make us all feel better. Surely, therefore, we need to look towards the creation of greater balance in the way we educate people so that the practical and intuitive wisdom of the past can be blended with the appropriate technology and knowledge of the present to produce the type of practitioner who is acutely aware of both the visible and invisible worlds that inform the entire cosmos.</p> <p>The future will need people who understand that sustainable development is not merely about a series of technical fixes, about re-designing humanity or re-engineering nature in an extension of globalised industrialisation - but about a re-connection with nature and a profound understanding of the concepts of care that underpin long-term stewardship. Only by re-discovering the essential unity and order of the living and spiritual world - as in the case of organic agriculture or integrated medicine or in the way we build - and by bridging the destructive chasm between cynical secularism and the timelessness of traditional religion, will we avoid the disintegration of our overall environment.</p> <p>Above all, I don't want to see the day when we are rounded upon by our grandchildren and asked accusingly why we didn't listen more carefully to the wisdom of our hearts as well as to the rational analysis of our heads; why we didn't pay more attention to the preservation of bio-diversity and traditional communities or think more clearly about our role as stewards of creation. Taking precautions, or achieving balance in life is never as much fun as the alternatives, but that is what sustainable development is all about.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Rob Bailey, making his 350th first-class appearance, took guard with the easy air of a man who had already dealt with every sling and arrow the perverse old game had to offer. Though diffident by nature, the batsman once known as the Biddulph Biffer has the confidence that comes with considerable ability and long experience. </p> <p>But Bailey had never seen Gary Ramsden before. Nor had anyone else. Plucked from Huddersfield New College, where he is in the middle of three A levels, Ramsden, 17, was told only yesterday morning that he would be making his first-class debut in this First Division fixture. </p> <p>Short and slight, he did not look an imposing figure when he entered the Yorkshire attack with Derbyshire 68 for one on the first morning. Nor did his opening spell, 4-1-20-0, amount to much, though he was unlucky to bowl against a fluent Michael di Venuto. </p> <p>He showed some character when he returned for a second spell. He bowled much better and took his first wicket when he had Bailey caught behind with a beauty that swung away and bounced surprisingly. </p> <p>Young Yorkshire seamers normally wear a disconsolate air for there are few opportunities for them. But yesterday Darren Gough and Craig White were elsewhere and Chris Silverwood had a heel injury. They were also without Ryan Sidebottom, who suffered a groin injury in the nets the previous day. </p> <p>Ramsden (Chippy?) finished with figures of one for 32 and we will see him again. But Paul Hutchison's first appearance of the season was of greater significance for followers of Yorkshire cricket. </p> <p>The left-arm seamer played only three games last season after back surgery following the England A team tour of South Africa and Zimbabwe in 1998-99. Here he bowled a good attacking line and took three of the first four wickets. </p> <p>Derbyshire won the toss and chose to bat on a fine, straw-coloured pitch which belied the recent rains. They were disappointed to close the first day on 285 for eight, even though there was swing and occasional seam movement. </p> <p>Matthew Dowman went first when he drove Hutchison to Matthew Wood at short cover. Di Venuto then produced a busy cameo, striking five fours in his 29-ball 30 before Gavin Hamilton beat his on-drive with a full-length delivery that swung late. </p> <p>Steve Stubbings played well before he was caught by the only slip when one short of his half-century. And Derbyshire were 166 for four when Matthew Cassar was caught-and-bowled for 47 by a delivery that stopped on him. </p> <p>The most enterprising batting came from the captain Dominic Cork and Simon Lacey, who added 70 in 25 overs after Derbyshire had slumped to 198 for six. Cork's bellicose 43 included a six over extra cover off Matthew Hoggard. </p> <p>At the end Darren Lehmann, bowling left-arm spin, claimed some of the bowlers' limelight with figures of 6-2-6-2. In wet and windy conditions which forced four brief breaks in play this was a good day's cricket.</p>",

Though diffident by nature, the batsman once known as the Biddulph Biffer has the confidence that comes with considerable ability and long experience. But Bailey had never seen Gary Ramsden before. Nor had anyone else. Plucked from Huddersfield New College, where he is in the middle of three A levels, Ramsden, 17, was told only yesterday morning that he would be making his first-class debut in this First Division fixture. Short and slight, he did not look an imposing figure when he entered the Yorkshire attack with Derbyshire 68 for one on the first morning. Nor did his opening spell, 4-1-20-0, amount to much, though he was unlucky to bowl against a fluent Michael di Venuto. He showed some character when he returned for a second spell. He bowled much better and took his first wicket when he had Bailey caught behind with a beauty that swung away and bounced surprisingly. Young Yorkshire seamers normally wear a disconsolate air for there are few opportunities for them. But yesterday Darren Gough and Craig White were elsewhere and Chris Silverwood had a heel injury. They were also without Ryan Sidebottom, who suffered a groin injury in the nets the previous day. Ramsden (Chippy?) finished with figures of one for 32 and we will see him again. But Paul Hutchison's first appearance of the season was of greater significance for followers of Yorkshire cricket. The left-arm seamer played only three games last season after back surgery following the England A team tour of South Africa and Zimbabwe in 1998-99. Here he bowled a good attacking line and took three of the first four wickets. Derbyshire won the toss and chose to bat on a fine, straw-coloured pitch which belied the recent rains. They were disappointed to close the first day on 285 for eight, even though there was swing and occasional seam movement. Matthew Dowman went first when he drove Hutchison to Matthew Wood at short cover. Di Venuto then produced a busy cameo, striking five fours in his 29-ball 30 before Gavin Hamilton beat his on-drive with a full-length delivery that swung late. Steve Stubbings played well before he was caught by the only slip when one short of his half-century. And Derbyshire were 166 for four when Matthew Cassar was caught-and-bowled for 47 by a delivery that stopped on him. The most enterprising batting came from the captain Dominic Cork and Simon Lacey, who added 70 in 25 overs after Derbyshire had slumped to 198 for six. Cork's bellicose 43 included a six over extra cover off Matthew Hoggard. At the end Darren Lehmann, bowling left-arm spin, claimed some of the bowlers' limelight with figures of 6-2-6-2. In wet and windy conditions which forced four brief breaks in play this was a good day's cricket.",

Welcome, Zimbabweans all, to test cricket in England. </p> <p>The reception from the England team promises to warm them up a little. Even if rankings are not a complete pointer, it is evident on results that Zimbabwe are the worst of the test countries and England are not much better. </p> <p>There is little affection for England at present, so they need to begin resurrecting their esteem by performing above themselves in this two-match series. They know they should win comfortably, given a clear run at Lord's and Nottingham. Performing badly cannot be countenanced. </p> <p>But there is a fine line between confidence and complacency and Nasser Hussain let it be known that underestimating the qualities in a side who boast no genuine stars but who scrap mightily is the road to disaster. \"Respect,\" the captain said yesterday. \"You have to respect the opposition.\" </p> <p>The truth is, though, that over the past 12 months, during which Zimbabwe lost to New Zealand and South Africa, they have produced few positives to carry forward. </p> <p>\"On results we should win the match,\" Hussain continued. \"But they get the absolute utmost from their players. They have great concentration, great discipline, know their tasks and their limitations and stick with it. We have to match that.\" </p> <p>England can begin by getting the side right for the conditions. The pitch yesterday had substance to it but there was live grass and it was damp. There were cracks too, lateral and horizontal, which are solid enough now but may provide uneven bounce later. </p> <p>\"A typical Lord's pitch,\" said Hussain, who would not elim-inate any of the 13 players at his disposal until seeing the overhead conditions this morn- ing and a detailed forecast. </p> <p>With the batting settled - Mark Ramprakash will be Mike Atherton's 12th opening partner - the first decision will be whether to jettison spin for a seam-loaded attack. All Hussain's instincts lean towards having a spin option and this would give Chris Schofield his first cap. </p> <p>However, spinners generally contribute little to the wicket- taking process at Lord's - 10 of the 88 wickets to fall in the past three tests - and the combination of moisture and a cold, blustery wind would make finger spin arduous, never mind wrist spin. </p> <p>Seam, with the option of a little spin from Graeme Hick and Ramprakash if necessary, might be the pragmatic choice. There would then be the question of whether to play the all-rounder Craig White with either Steve Harmison or Ed Giddins, or whether to go with both pace bowlers at the expense of the all-rounder. </p> <p>Choosing between Harmison and Giddins might not be easy. But the ball would swing less in cold weather for Giddins, and Harmison, as Hussain pointed out, has real pace, a commodity to be prized above others. A northerly wind blows across the square so there will be no into-the-wind donkey work either. </p> <p>There is another consideration because, respect or not, here is a golden opportunity to blood a player against a weaker side. Failure to do so might mean waiting until the winter or next summer against Australia. Playing Harmison now would represent an investment for the future. </p> <p>Zimbabwe are likely to include both their highest wicket-taker Heath Streak, despite his knee injury, and the leg-spinner Brian Murphy, who arrived here only on Friday; the thinking being that in 40 of their 41 Tests they have played a leg-spinner and, with no high pace, they might be bland without the variety. But, as they won the odd match out with an all-seam attack and have never played at Lords in mid-May, they ought to rethink. </p> <p>Murphy is accurate rather than mesmeric, backed up by deep-set and highly agile fields. Much the same goes for the seamers, who have the discipline to plough a deep fur row outside off stump once the shine has gone. Henry Olonga, the mercurial and occasionally profligate pace man, has developed what might be a diplomatic ankle injury and the more restrained Bryan Strang and Pommie Mbangwa may play. </p> <p>Playing off-stump patience with the opposition is a very southern African method and one with which Hussain is familiar. Last weekend for Essex he batted against it for two hours 40 minutes, making 33. However, anyone who saw his six-hour hundred against KwaZulu-Natal in Durban and his 10-hour test marathon there will know that in Chelmsford he was only clearing his throat for the grand aria. It may be worth hearing.</p>",

There were cracks too, lateral and horizontal, which are solid enough now but may provide uneven bounce later. \"A typical Lord's pitch,\" said Hussain, who would not elim-inate any of the 13 players at his disposal until seeing the overhead conditions this morn- ing and a detailed forecast. With the batting settled - Mark Ramprakash will be Mike Atherton's 12th opening partner - the first decision will be whether to jettison spin for a seam-loaded attack. All Hussain's instincts lean towards having a spin option and this would give Chris Schofield his first cap. However, spinners generally contribute little to the wicket- taking process at Lord's - 10 of the 88 wickets to fall in the past three tests - and the combination of moisture and a cold, blustery wind would make finger spin arduous, never mind wrist spin. Seam, with the option of a little spin from Graeme Hick and Ramprakash if necessary, might be the pragmatic choice. There would then be the question of whether to play the all-rounder Craig White with either Steve Harmison or Ed Giddins, or whether to go with both pace bowlers at the expense of the all-rounder. Choosing between Harmison and Giddins might not be easy. But the ball would swing less in cold weather for Giddins, and Harmison, as Hussain pointed out, has real pace, a commodity to be prized above others. A northerly wind blows across the square so there will be no into-the-wind donkey work either. There is another consideration because, respect or not, here is a golden opportunity to blood a player against a weaker side. Failure to do so might mean waiting until the winter or next summer against Australia. Playing Harmison now would represent an investment for the future. Zimbabwe are likely to include both their highest wicket-taker Heath Streak, despite his knee injury, and the leg-spinner Brian Murphy, who arrived here only on Friday; the thinking being that in 40 of their 41 Tests they have played a leg-spinner and, with no high pace, they might be bland without the variety. But, as they won the odd match out with an all-seam attack and have never played at Lords in mid-May, they ought to rethink. Murphy is accurate rather than mesmeric, backed up by deep-set and highly agile fields. Much the same goes for the seamers, who have the discipline to plough a deep fur row outside off stump once the shine has gone. Henry Olonga, the mercurial and occasionally profligate pace man, has developed what might be a diplomatic ankle injury and the more restrained Bryan Strang and Pommie Mbangwa may play. Playing off-stump patience with the opposition is a very southern African method and one with which Hussain is familiar. Last weekend for Essex he batted against it for two hours 40 minutes, making 33. However, anyone who saw his six-hour hundred against KwaZulu-Natal in Durban and his 10-hour test marathon there will know that in Chelmsford he was only clearing his throat for the grand aria. It may be worth hearing.",

Another penalty in extra-time, this time taken by Clapham, put Ipswich ahead for the first time in the tie and Reuser sealed it after Robbie Elliott was sent off.",
