Hendry's move to Rangers in the summer of 1998 for \u00a33m, reputedly to become captain of the club, turned into one of the great transfer fiascos and he has had even less joy since moving to Coventry, having been both jeered by supporters and badly injured. </p> <p>After 48 caps, Hendry is just a blond forelock away from the 50-cap mark that would qualify him for the Scottish Football Association's hall of fame. Brown, though, has gambled with the player in the past and watched Hendry pay for it. It was no coincidence that he had not played for three months prior to last season's Euro 2000 play-offs against England and, having started both matches, did not appear for another 10 weeks having exacerbated his knee problem. </p> <p>\"I've had to be honest with Colin and tell him that I can't go on selecting him unless he is playing for a club,\" said Brown. \"I hope this is not the end of the road for him with us but he needs to resume playing. He'll be on the bench against Australia but I can say for certain he won't be selected against Belgium in March unless his situation has changed.\" </p> <p>Brown will give Brian O'Neil, recently arrived at Derby County from Wolfsburg, a chance again to establish himself at the heart of the Scottish defence. It was Brown who gave him his debut four years ago, coincidentally against Australia in a 1-0 win at Hampden Park. </p> <p>\"We had him in midfield and I think he is more suited to the role he's in now,\" said the Scotland coach. \"He would be the first to admit he is not an international midfielder, but he is an international defender. \" </p> <p>Dominic Matteo will also be given his Scotland bow, probably at left wing-back. Barry Ferguson and Craig Burley will be in midfield while Hendry's absence means a new captain is needed and this looks set to be Celtic's Tom Boyd. </p> <p>Leeds United's Mark Viduka, the short-lived favourite son of Celtic, will probably be on the Australian bench. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

It was no coincidence that he had not played for three months prior to last season's Euro 2000 play-offs against England and, having started both matches, did not appear for another 10 weeks having exacerbated his knee problem. \"I've had to be honest with Colin and tell him that I can't go on selecting him unless he is playing for a club,\" said Brown. \"I hope this is not the end of the road for him with us but he needs to resume playing. He'll be on the bench against Australia but I can say for certain he won't be selected against Belgium in March unless his situation has changed.\" Brown will give Brian O'Neil, recently arrived at Derby County from Wolfsburg, a chance again to establish himself at the heart of the Scottish defence. It was Brown who gave him his debut four years ago, coincidentally against Australia in a 1-0 win at Hampden Park. \"We had him in midfield and I think he is more suited to the role he's in now,\" said the Scotland coach. \"He would be the first to admit he is not an international midfielder, but he is an international defender. \" Dominic Matteo will also be given his Scotland bow, probably at left wing-back. Barry Ferguson and Craig Burley will be in midfield while Hendry's absence means a new captain is needed and this looks set to be Celtic's Tom Boyd. Leeds United's Mark Viduka, the short-lived favourite son of Celtic, will probably be on the Australian bench. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

In a way, it almost seems a shame he wasn't. Substitutions Del Piero on for F Inzaghi. Big cheers from the local Juve supporters for that one. Phillips and Johnson on for Heskey and Barry. 74 Substitution Bertotto on for Maldini. Johnson has a goal-scoring chance with his first touch when he gets in a toe-poke from six yards anly to see it go over the bar. 78 Substitution Anderton on for Parlour. Terrible atmosphere in the stadium now as driving rain silences those fans that made effort to turn up for tonight's admittedly meaningless game. 80 Italy free-kick deep on the left. Del Piero takes, decides to go for goal and is unlucky to see a blinding effort skim off the crossbar. 83 Substitution Fowler on for Dyer. 84 England continue to knock balls in to Phillips and Fowler, but all that results is another corner. Beckham takes from the left and Southgate gets up to head over the bar. What good is that, Gareth? 87 It's all becoming quite painful and it almost feels as though the game is being played behind closed doors, bar a couple of horns going off and a ghostly rumble when someone tries something different. 90 Two minutes of extra torture time to play. Curiously, the crowd briefly spring to life at the prospect of a swift finish. England have last stab at the Italy area before the ref calls time. The verdict on the Taylor Experiment? Could have done worse, but none the wiser after a soaking in the shadow of the Alps. Italy 1 - 0 England",

I found that an ill-informed, ill-considered and unconstructive comment.</p> <p>\"It is not sensible to dismiss glibly whole fields of academic endeavour.\"</p> <p>Mr Woodhead was questioned by MPs on the Commons select committee on his public comments on areas outside his reponsibility two weeks ago, the day before he announced his resignation after six years in the post.</p> <p>He is leaving at the end of the month to take up a new career next spring as a columnist for the Daily Telegraph and as a public relations consultant. The MPs referred to private correspondence from Mr Randall to Mr Woodhead in which Mr Randall made clear he was furious at the chief inspector's comments.</p> <p>At the conference yesterday Mr Randall said that Mr Woodhead's comments did not rest on any hard evidence, and implied that only traditional academic subjects were worthy of study at degree level.</p> <p>University heads were due to confront Mr Woodhead about his comments this week, but since announcing his resigna tion, Mr Woodhead has cancelled the meeting. Many academic leaders had feared that he wanted to expand Ofsted's role to inspect universities as well as colleges and schools.</p> <p>Meanwhile, officials are nervous about Mr Woodhead's remaining tasks in the final days of his job.</p> <p>He has, for example, chosen to preside over the publication on Friday of a critical report by Ofsted into Hackney council before he leaves in two weeks' time.</p> <p>Although the report is expected to acknowledge some improvements in the running of the education authority since the last inspection - with exam improvements evident in the latest secondary league tables - there will be concerns about instability through constant personnel changes.</p> <p>In a further blow to the cash-strapped borough, two more senior members of Hackney's education team resigned yesterday.</p> <p>The chief inspector is also preparing to publish a report on the progress of the government's literacy and numeracy strategy - arguably the bedrock of its drive to raise standards - before his departure. It is feared that he may decide to give more credit for progress to Ofsted than to the government.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The recent criticism of \"vacuous degrees\" by the outgoing chief inspector of schools, Chris Woodhead, was \"ill-informed, ill-considered and unconstructive\", the head of the government's universities watchdog claimed yesterday. The latest counterblast against the head of the office for standards in education came as officials at the Department for Education and Employment considered the need for a damage limitation exercise in the run-up to his departure from the post at the end of the month. They fear that Mr Woodhead may use the publication of two reports to launch a final, devastating attack on government education policies before he starts his new job. Yesterday John Randall, chief executive of the quality assurance agency for higher education, broke his public silence on the issue to criticise Mr Woodhead's foray into higher education - an area outside his remit. In a newspaper article in August, Mr Woodhead accused universities of devaluing the sector by offering a \"plethora of quasi-academic courses\", such as media studies and beauty therapy. Speaking yesterday at a con ference unveiling new criteria for degree standard in universities, Mr Randall said: \"A few weeks ago the now departing chief inspector of schools launched an attack on what he described as vacuous degrees. I found that an ill-informed, ill-considered and unconstructive comment. \"It is not sensible to dismiss glibly whole fields of academic endeavour.\" Mr Woodhead was questioned by MPs on the Commons select committee on his public comments on areas outside his reponsibility two weeks ago, the day before he announced his resignation after six years in the post. He is leaving at the end of the month to take up a new career next spring as a columnist for the Daily Telegraph and as a public relations consultant. The MPs referred to private correspondence from Mr Randall to Mr Woodhead in which Mr Randall made clear he was furious at the chief inspector's comments. At the conference yesterday Mr Randall said that Mr Woodhead's comments did not rest on any hard evidence, and implied that only traditional academic subjects were worthy of study at degree level. University heads were due to confront Mr Woodhead about his comments this week, but since announcing his resigna tion, Mr Woodhead has cancelled the meeting. Many academic leaders had feared that he wanted to expand Ofsted's role to inspect universities as well as colleges and schools. Meanwhile, officials are nervous about Mr Woodhead's remaining tasks in the final days of his job. He has, for example, chosen to preside over the publication on Friday of a critical report by Ofsted into Hackney council before he leaves in two weeks' time. Although the report is expected to acknowledge some improvements in the running of the education authority since the last inspection - with exam improvements evident in the latest secondary league tables - there will be concerns about instability through constant personnel changes. In a further blow to the cash-strapped borough, two more senior members of Hackney's education team resigned yesterday. The chief inspector is also preparing to publish a report on the progress of the government's literacy and numeracy strategy - arguably the bedrock of its drive to raise standards - before his departure. It is feared that he may decide to give more credit for progress to Ofsted than to the government.",

      "bodyText": "A deluded fan who tried to kill former Beatle George Harrison and his wife was tonight ordered detained indefinitely in a secure psychiatric hospital. Michael Abram, 34, was found not guilty due to insanity of two counts of attempted murder after the jury of six men and six women at Oxford crown court heard he was a paranoid schizophrenic who did not know he was doing wrong at the time of the attack. Mr Justice Astill described the incident as a \"horrifying attack\" and ordered Mr Abram be sent to the hospital \"without time restriction\". Armed with a knife, an electrical flex, a table lamp and a pole from a broken statue, Mr Abram rampaged through the millionaire's mansion in Henley-on-Thames, Oxon, claiming he was on a \"mission from God\" to murder Mr Harrison, 57, and his wife Olivia on December 30 last year. The court was told how he stabbed the guitarist at least 10 times before battering him with the table lamp and threatening to kill Mrs Harrison, 52, with the flex. Yesterday the jury was told in Mr Harrison's own words how he feared he was about to die as his blood-soaked wild-eyed attacker plunged a knife into his chest puncturing his lung. Mr Abram believed he was the fifth Beatle and his victim was a witch, the court heard earlier today. Psychologists had told the jury there was clear evidence Mr Abram was insane. The jury took one hour and two minutes to return its verdicts after hearing that the former heroin addict believed he was possessed by Mr Harrison. Mr Abram thought he was being conspired against by a host of celebrities including members of Oasis and the Beatles and Madonna, the court heard. The blond-haired 34-year-old had denied two counts of attempted murder. The jury had been told that there is no dispute over whether Mr Abram committed the offences, but that it was a case for them to decide whether he was insane at the time of the attacks.

Mr Abram's condition deteriorated after the solar eclipse in August last year, and he became convinced he was on a mission from God, Dr Joseph told the court. Dr Joseph said Abram would sit on a upturned plant pot in his bare flat in Huyton, Merseyside, listening to songs by John Lennon, Bob Marley, U2 and the Beatles, which would feed his delusions.

      "bodyText": "Health managers are blamed for a catalogue of serious failings in the quality of care at three NHS hospitals criticised in official reports published today. An investigation into problems at the Oxford Heart Centre, one of Britain's leading coronary units, discovered poor standards of clinical care and under-supervision of inexperienced doctors. North Lakeland NHS trust in Cumbria is criticised by health service standards watchdog, the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI), for degrading and cruel practices, including the strapping of mentally-ill patients to their commodes. Officials at Carmarthenshire NHS trust in Wales came under fire for failing to tighten procedures quickly enough in the wake of a blunder in which the wrong kidney was removed from a seriously ill patient. The government is expected to ask CHI to formally investigate the Oxford Heart Centre, part of the John Radcliffe Hospital. Health minister John Denham today described the management team at the centre as \"dysfunctional\". The Lakeland and Carmarthenshire reports are the first to be issued by CHI, which came into being in April. CHI has been dubbed the \"Ofsted of the NHS\" - a reference to the formidable education inspectorate which has \"named and shamed' failing schools. Mr Denham ordered an immediate turn-round in performance at the Oxford Heart Centre. He said: \"It is a very worrying report. It paints a picture of a dysfunctional team and, more than that, a failure to deal with problems when they were first raised.\" He told the BBC's Radio Four Today programme: \"What we have to do is tackle the management failings, the failings of people to work on the team and get it back on the road.\" The study was ordered in March this year - before CHI was set up - after staff raised concerns over operational practice. Fears included the quality of pre and post-operative care, claims that junior doctors were not properly supervised, and allegations that there was a culture of intimidation preventing staff airing their worries. The hard-hitting CHI report into North Lakeland NHS trust in Cumbria blames \"whole systems failure\" for a catalogue of degrading, unprofessional and cruel practices at Garlands Hospital in Carlisle. The CHI inquiry report confirmed allegations that patients were tied to commodes, sworn at and denied food, clothing and blankets. The trust chairman and the director of personnel have been dismissed, while the chief executive has been suspended pending a disciplinary hearing. Other senior managers have received warnings. CHI chief executive Peter Homa said: \"The abuse of elderly people was appalling. At the time of our visit to the trust, we could not be sure that it could not happen again. \"The culture of this organisation needs to change fundamentally, so that the rights of patients are understood across the trust.\" The CHI report into failures at Carmarthenshire NHS trust stemmed from the case of Korean war veteran Graham Reeves, who died in February after surgeons at the Prince Philip Hospital in Llanelli removed his healthy kidney by mistake, leaving him with just his diseased kidney. CHI said that the trust had drawn up an action plan to address the problems, but had been slow in implementing it. It also found there was still confusion in the minds of some staff about the handling of critical incidents. CHI chief executive Peter Homa said: \"While we cannot be specific about the failures that led to Mr Reeves's death, we can say that the trust's action plan addresses the right issues, but is taking longer to implement fully than it should.\" The Royal College of Surgeons and the trust, which runs the hospital where the mix-up took place, have already carried out investigations into the incident, but their findings have not been released.",

      "body": "<p>Angry funeral processions, rock-throwing and gun battles marked the twelfth anniversary of the symbolic declaration of Palestinian independence today.</p> <p>Six men were killed by Israeli army fire in confrontations on the West Bank and Gaza strip and 36 more were injured.</p> <p>Two died at the Karni crossing between Israel and Gaza, two in the West Bank town of Tulkarem, one in Hebron and one in Jericho. In addition, a Palestinian died in Gaza of his wounds.</p> <p>Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader who declared independence while in exile in Algeria, said today it was the world's responsibility to get the peace talks back on track. Unlike previous independence days he will not be making a public address.</p> <p>Mr Arafat had said a Palestinian state would be established in 2000 but after seven weeks of Israeli-Palestinian fighting he is no longer under pressure to deliver.</p> <p>\"We are not disappointed because we are continuing our struggle and the struggle needs some time,\" said Marwan Abdel Hamed, a Palestinian legislator. The anniversary came as Israel enforced a tight blockade of Palestinian towns and villages for a second day, paralyzing life in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The blockade served as a reminder to Palestinians that it will be difficult to establish a state without Israel's cooperation.</p> <p>Israel says it will resume negotiations when the violence stops but no sooner. \"We are in the middle of a march of folly, and this tragic situation needs to be brought to an end,\" said foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami.</p> <p>After a telephone conversation with Bill Clinton, Mr Arafat told Palestinian gunmen to stop firing at Israelis from populated Palestinian areas, so as not to draw return fire and risk the killing of Palestinian civilians.</p> <p>However, just hours after his order, Palestinian gunmen shot at Israeli soldiers from an unfinished apartment block on the outskirts of Ramallah.

      "bodyText": "Angry funeral processions, rock-throwing and gun battles marked the twelfth anniversary of the symbolic declaration of Palestinian independence today. Six men were killed by Israeli army fire in confrontations on the West Bank and Gaza strip and 36 more were injured. Two died at the Karni crossing between Israel and Gaza, two in the West Bank town of Tulkarem, one in Hebron and one in Jericho. In addition, a Palestinian died in Gaza of his wounds. Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader who declared independence while in exile in Algeria, said today it was the world's responsibility to get the peace talks back on track. Unlike previous independence days he will not be making a public address. Mr Arafat had said a Palestinian state would be established in 2000 but after seven weeks of Israeli-Palestinian fighting he is no longer under pressure to deliver. \"We are not disappointed because we are continuing our struggle and the struggle needs some time,\" said Marwan Abdel Hamed, a Palestinian legislator. The anniversary came as Israel enforced a tight blockade of Palestinian towns and villages for a second day, paralyzing life in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The blockade served as a reminder to Palestinians that it will be difficult to establish a state without Israel's cooperation. Israel says it will resume negotiations when the violence stops but no sooner. \"We are in the middle of a march of folly, and this tragic situation needs to be brought to an end,\" said foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami. After a telephone conversation with Bill Clinton, Mr Arafat told Palestinian gunmen to stop firing at Israelis from populated Palestinian areas, so as not to draw return fire and risk the killing of Palestinian civilians. However, just hours after his order, Palestinian gunmen shot at Israeli soldiers from an unfinished apartment block on the outskirts of Ramallah. Troops returned fire, and shot a rocket into the building. Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak is today meeting his security cabinet to discuss Israel's response to the shooting ambushes. Mr Barak is under growing public pressure to retaliate harshly for the killings of Israelis but apparently fears that a painful Israeli strike will further reduce the chance of resuming peace talks, which he has said will remain his ultimate goal. Mr Barak returned late yesterday from a trip to the United States that produced no breakthroughs. Mr Clinton, whose presidential term ends in two months, pushed for a quick renewal of peace talks, but Mr Barak told him he cannot negotiate as long as the violence persists. Mr Clinton says that his biggest regret may be his failure to reconcile Israel and the Palestinians. \"I really wanted with all my heart to finish the Oslo peace process,\" he said. \"You know, somebody has got to quit shooting.\" Related stories Middle East peace process: the issue explained 15 May 1948: The Jewish state born 8 July 1937: Partition of Palestine Interactive guide History of Israel Useful links Yasser Arafat's office Ehud Barak's office Israeli government Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty party (Torah-based religious party) Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security) Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group) Organisation of Rabbis for the People of Israel Palestinian national authority Egyptian presidency Hamas Jerusalem Post Jordan Times",

Tonight, in the Stadio Delle Alpi, his young team will have to play one. But the omens don't look promising: the last time England won in Italy was way back in 1961 when Elvis was in the charts and Bobby Charlton had hair. But Charlton - and his counterparts Johnny Haynes and Jimmy Greaves - knew a thing about scoring. They managed to unlock the catenneccio three times that night. Most of us would be grateful if Heskey and Barmby did it just once.</p> <p>Furthermore, England will be up against a near full strength Italy side. Francesco Totti misses out because of injury, but the other big names from the Euro 2000 squad are there, ready (as the tabloids might say) to tear Taylor's young lions to shreds. And what young, inexperienced lions they are: England are without five almost certain starters in Brown, Owen, Smith, Gerrard and Scholes. In their place comes Parlour, Butt and Neville - not exactly the names that tripped off the nation's tongue when Taylor announced that he was giving youth a chance. </p> <p>And yet, and yet England really do have every chance of scrapping a draw. For a start, the Italian players and public often regards friendlies as an irrelevance. Giovanni Trapattoni - like Svennis - hardly knows which players England are playing, and most Italian people barely care. And with only 20,000 likely to be in Stadio Delle Alpi tonight, the atmosphere is likely to resemble a deserted church. If England can hold out for the first ten minutes, then twenty and thirty, the game will start to drift.

Shortarse admirers of Mussolini get his goat in particular, especially when they suggest that top West Ham prodigies are not yet ready to play for England and \"must prove themselves, match after match, for a long time, not just a few games\".</p> <p>\"Enough is enough,\" growled the Hat after hearing Paolo Di Canio question whether Rio Ferdinand and Joe Cole really have what it takes to succeed. \"I can't allow this to go on,\" he hissed, slowly removing his fetching pig leather car coat (with shearling collar). \"I know Rio has been sickened by this. I have a terrific bunch of lads with a wonderful team spirit and will not stand by and watch somebody wreck it.\" </p> <p>\"I'm so angry,\" the obviously livid Hat pointed out unnecessarily after a short pause. \"I don't care who he is or how much talent he has, Paolo cannot get away with this time and again. I don't want to sell Paolo, but there comes a time when you have to do something about it and take action.\" Whether this \"action\" will involve renegotiating with Lazio - who had a bid for the player turned down earlier this season - or fitting Di Canio with a slightly heavier set of trendy red boots, we don't know.

In that time he spent \u00a3293,000 on flowers and more than \u00a39.6 million on property, the packed court heard as the 53-year-old singer gave evidence in his multi-million pound contract battle. Sir Elton, dressed in a grey suit, white shirt and brightly-patterned blue tie, and watched in the witness box by his long-term partner David Furnish, said: \"I have no one to leave the money to. I'm a single man. I like spending my money.\" Details of his spending came as he was cross-examined by Mark Hapgood QC, representing City accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the two parties being sued by the star. Mr Hapgood suggested to Sir Elton that he went \"spending mad\" following a $60 million deal with recording company Polygram in February 1996. He referred to a report summary prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers of Sir Elton's personal spending from January 1996 to September 1997. Under the heading of \"personal\" the accountants had calculated that in that period Sir Elton had spent just under \u00a330 million at an average of \u00a31.5 million a month. Mr Hapgood asked Sir Elton, who is expected to be in the box for the rest of the week: \"Do you have any reason to think that inaccurate?\" Sir Elton: \"Probably not. No.\" Mr Hapgood: \"\u00a3293,000 on flowers alone - is that possible?\" Sir Elton: \"Yes, I like flowers.\" Mr Hapgood: \"In the same period, over \u00a39.6 million on property?\" Sir Elton: \"Yes\". When Mr Hapgood again put it to Sir Elton that he had personally spent the millions, the superstar replied: \"Hmmm.\" Mr Hapgood: \"Just under \u00a32 million a month on average?\" Sir Elton: \"Yes.\" The star is suing Andrew Haydon, 45, former managing director of John Reid Enterprises (JREL), which for many years was his management company, and City accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, which looked after his business interests. The star alleges that Mr Haydon was negligent in allowing JREL to charge him overseas tour expenses - including booking agents, accountants and producers. Sir Elton's case is that the \"several millions\" which he paid out in touring expenses should have been borne by JREL under a management agreement. PricewaterhouseCoopers (formerly Price Waterhouse) are accused by Sir Elton of negligence in managing his affairs. Both defendants are vigorously contesting the allegations against them. Mr Haydon denies negligence and claims that everything had been done in accordance with management contract terms and conditions. PricewaterhouseCoopers say they have looked very carefully at the criticisms made and rejected them, and would be asking the judge to rule that the firm's employees had acted according to the highest professional standards. Sir Elton has already accepted $5m from Mr Reid in settlement of his claims against him. The star told the court that he thought he was being \"ripped off\" by Mr Reid, his former business manager.

Welcome to the Hoobs. </p> <p>If you are a parent of a child under five, it is very likely that, however much you try to resist, by next spring you will find yourself referring to young children as \"tiddlypeeps\", while words like \"hoobledo\" and \"hoobacious\" will be popping up in your conversation. Recent audience research for another new BBC pre-school show, Yoho Ahoy, has revealed that adults with children are more likely to be able to quote chunks of Postman Pat or the Tweenies than any lines from literary classics. This is hardly surprising given the way pre-school television is taking over more and more airtime. Children's TV, particularly for this youngest age group, is becoming an increasingly competitive and lucrative market. </p> <p>Channel 4 is loath to provide an exact figure for what it has paid Muppets creator Jim Henson's company for The Hoobs, but industry estimates make the deal worth at least \u00a314m. For that money, C4 is buying 250 half-hour programmes which commissioning editor Paul Ashton claims will \"combine style and innovation with clear child-development thinking\". Besides featuring Henson's signature puppetry, as well as animation and participation from real live \"tiddlypeeps\", the Hoobs will emphasisediscovery. In every episode, the Hoobs, highly coloured characters who travel the universe in, naturally, a Hoobmobile, will try to find out the answer to a single question; for example, \"What things float?\" The programme is also aiming to be an early introduction to the internet; the series will be supported by a parallel website \"and other educational materials\". </p> <p>All of this is a far cry from the way things were 15 years ago when Anne Wood, creator of Rosie and Jim and Teletubbies, founded her own chil dren's production company. Ragdoll has come a long way from its humble origins at her kitchen table: at the Children's Bafta awards on Sunday, Wood was acclaimed for her \"outstanding contribution to children's film and television\", recognition of the fact that her style of programming has reshaped the entire industry. When she was starting out, the rule of thumb in television was that the younger the audience, the smaller the budget. </p> <p>\"Young children were ignored in broadcasting for years. Nobody thought these programmes had any significance,\" explains Wood. \"Then parents began to buy videos and children would watch them over and over again. And as soon as other people saw that there was money to be made, they started to take an interest.\" </p> <p>This process was accelerated when, in 1997, Wood and her colleague Andrew Davenport won a commission for a new BBC series aimed at one to three year olds: Teletubbies looked and sounded like nothing that had ever been shown on children's television before. But not everyone was immediately convinced of its merits. In a letter to the Daily Telegraph, one parent described them as \"weird alien creatures that can't even talk properly\". But columnists such as Nigella Lawson found their children loved it and soon leaped to the programme's defence. </p> <p>Then came the merchandising. By Christmas, there were reports of near-riots in department stores, as parents tried desperately to obtain the dolls for their loved ones. </p> <p>\"Teletubbies changed the nature of the pre-school market,\" comments Lucy Rouse, editor of the TV industry magazine Broadcast. \"Others saw the success and the spin-offs, and realised there was a new target audience in younger children and their parents.\" </p> <p>As further Teletubbies clones have arrived, the direction of this expanding market has roused critics. The Pre-school Learning Alliance, an educational charity, has recently endorsed the new GMTV pre-school series MacDonald's Farm, but it still has reservations about the direction of the industry. </p> <p>\"There has always been some mar keting attached to pre-school programmes, but it's more powerful nowadays,\" says Ann Henderson of the Alliance. \"The bottom line is that companies are interested in shareholders, not children. </p> <p>\"It is very easy to tag the word 'educational' onto a package. Just because it has letters and numbers on something doesn't mean it's educational. Parents have got to watch programmes with their children and see what they are getting out of it,\" she advises. \"If they don't like what they see, they should take them for a walk or play a game instead.\" </p> <p>The figures for profits from pre-school television sales, and spin-offs such as videos and toys, keep mounting up. In its first year, Tellytubbies made a staggering \u00a323m. Only a few weeks ago, it was announced that the Tweenies had outstripped this record by amassing a \u00a330m profit in its first year. No details have yet been released about the exact nature of the merchandising that will accompany the Hoobs, but Angus Fletcher from the Henson Company confirms that there will be \"a lot of activity in this area\". Undoubtedly, this will prove an understatement. Channel 4's Paul Ashton says he believes it is naive to think that you can now have an international pre-school series without merchandising: \"I think parents do want to buy things for their kids, and the job of people like me is to offer them good things rather than rubbish. </p> <p>\"You can't just wish the whole area away. Henson is a commercial company and we are a commercial company and children do want to hug something they have seen on TV.\" </p> <p>Anne Wood says she has some sympathy with parents who worry about the expense and effect of merchandising, but she too concedes that this is now the nature of the business. Most pre-school programmes are not fully funded. The companies that make them are left to recoup some of their costs from spin-off sales. </p> <p>\"It's not a question of whether we like it or not. We just have to deal with it or we wouldn't be making programmes at all,\" says Wood. </p> <p>\u0095 The Hoobs will be broadcast on Channel 4 from January.</p> <p><strong> For the children: a history of pre-school TV</strong></p> <p><strong> 1946</strong> The BBC broadcasts its first ever kids' TV programme, inspirationally titled For the Children. A few months later, Muffin the Mule (below) takes his first steps to TV stardom. Many early programmes were broadcast on Sunday afternoon, leading church leaders to express concern that children would be lured away from Sunday school. </p> <p><strong> 1950 </strong> Andy Pandy, Looby Loo and Teddy come out to play for the first time. </p> <p><strong> 1952 </strong> Bill and Ben appear on our TV screens. Plans have been announced for a revival next summer. </p> <p><strong> 1964 </strong> Humpty, Big Ted, Little Ted and Jemima make their debut in Play School. Play School inadvertently became BBC 2's first programme: the previous night's grand opening didn't happen because of a power failure. </p> <p><strong> 1972 </strong> Rainbow, ITV's long-running series, makes puppets Bungle, George and Zippy household names. Geoffrey joins the following year. </p> <p><strong> 1980 </strong> The title Watch with Mother is finally dropped from the schedules. </p> <p><strong> 1988 </strong> After 25 years of Play School, and despite a public backlash, the BBC replaces it with Playdays. </p> <p><strong> 1990 </strong> A turning point in pre-school TV: Rosie and Jim chug on to our screens in their canal barge, and producers Ragdoll realise there is a market among pressured parents for videos. </p> <p><strong> 1997 </strong> The new Ragdoll products, Tellytubbies, say \"Eh-oh\". The single goes to number one, and within a year the BBC has amassed \u00a323m in profits from the show and merchandise. </p> <p><strong> 1999 </strong> The Tweenies arrive on BBC. This brightly coloured quartet proves to be just as popular as the previous brightly coloured quartet. </p> <p><strong> 2001</strong> The Hoobs say a \"Hoobiehello\" to young Channel 4 viewers. It will be the first pre-school programme to introduce children to the internet.</p>",

By Christmas, there were reports of near-riots in department stores, as parents tried desperately to obtain the dolls for their loved ones. \"Teletubbies changed the nature of the pre-school market,\" comments Lucy Rouse, editor of the TV industry magazine Broadcast. \"Others saw the success and the spin-offs, and realised there was a new target audience in younger children and their parents.\" As further Teletubbies clones have arrived, the direction of this expanding market has roused critics. The Pre-school Learning Alliance, an educational charity, has recently endorsed the new GMTV pre-school series MacDonald's Farm, but it still has reservations about the direction of the industry. \"There has always been some mar keting attached to pre-school programmes, but it's more powerful nowadays,\" says Ann Henderson of the Alliance. \"The bottom line is that companies are interested in shareholders, not children. \"It is very easy to tag the word 'educational' onto a package. Just because it has letters and numbers on something doesn't mean it's educational. Parents have got to watch programmes with their children and see what they are getting out of it,\" she advises. \"If they don't like what they see, they should take them for a walk or play a game instead.\" The figures for profits from pre-school television sales, and spin-offs such as videos and toys, keep mounting up. In its first year, Tellytubbies made a staggering \u00a323m. Only a few weeks ago, it was announced that the Tweenies had outstripped this record by amassing a \u00a330m profit in its first year. No details have yet been released about the exact nature of the merchandising that will accompany the Hoobs, but Angus Fletcher from the Henson Company confirms that there will be \"a lot of activity in this area\". Undoubtedly, this will prove an understatement. Channel 4's Paul Ashton says he believes it is naive to think that you can now have an international pre-school series without merchandising: \"I think parents do want to buy things for their kids, and the job of people like me is to offer them good things rather than rubbish. \"You can't just wish the whole area away. Henson is a commercial company and we are a commercial company and children do want to hug something they have seen on TV.\" Anne Wood says she has some sympathy with parents who worry about the expense and effect of merchandising, but she too concedes that this is now the nature of the business. Most pre-school programmes are not fully funded. The companies that make them are left to recoup some of their costs from spin-off sales. \"It's not a question of whether we like it or not. We just have to deal with it or we wouldn't be making programmes at all,\" says Wood. \u0095 The Hoobs will be broadcast on Channel 4 from January. For the children: a history of pre-school TV 1946 The BBC broadcasts its first ever kids' TV programme, inspirationally titled For the Children. A few months later, Muffin the Mule (below) takes his first steps to TV stardom. Many early programmes were broadcast on Sunday afternoon, leading church leaders to express concern that children would be lured away from Sunday school. 1950 Andy Pandy, Looby Loo and Teddy come out to play for the first time. 1952 Bill and Ben appear on our TV screens. Plans have been announced for a revival next summer. 1964 Humpty, Big Ted, Little Ted and Jemima make their debut in Play School. Play School inadvertently became BBC 2's first programme: the previous night's grand opening didn't happen because of a power failure. 1972 Rainbow, ITV's long-running series, makes puppets Bungle, George and Zippy household names. Geoffrey joins the following year. 1980 The title Watch with Mother is finally dropped from the schedules. 1988 After 25 years of Play School, and despite a public backlash, the BBC replaces it with Playdays. 1990 A turning point in pre-school TV: Rosie and Jim chug on to our screens in their canal barge, and producers Ragdoll realise there is a market among pressured parents for videos. 1997 The new Ragdoll products, Tellytubbies, say \"Eh-oh\". The single goes to number one, and within a year the BBC has amassed \u00a323m in profits from the show and merchandise. 1999 The Tweenies arrive on BBC. This brightly coloured quartet proves to be just as popular as the previous brightly coloured quartet. 2001 The Hoobs say a \"Hoobiehello\" to young Channel 4 viewers. It will be the first pre-school programme to introduce children to the internet.",

Kourbaj has given me fresh hope that the fond idea of my kids as infant geniuses (retired) was not totally crackpot after all. \"The true artist does not borrow,\" said Picasso, \"he steals.\" And this is what Kourbaj has done: brazenly plundered and plagiarised the early works of his three-year-old son Mourad, and mounted an exhibition, is/am, in which, to be fair, he has hung the little guy's paintings on the wall alongside his own. </p> <p>Kourbaj the elder was born in the black mountains of southern Syria. He had the classic artistic upbringing - illiterate, impoverished, selling chewing gum in the streets. His uncle Suleyman used to make things out of unexploded bombs (he died, of course, rather suddenly), and the young Issam was similarly forced to make all his own toys, fortunately out of less lethal debris. This rigorous training took him from the Institute of Fine Arts in Damascus to the Academy of Art in St Petersburg, and finally to London to study architecture and theatre design. </p> <p>Kourbaj, to my eye, looks like the young Cat Stevens when I go to see him in his studio in Cambridge. To his son's eye, however, he has red hair, green ears, eyes like catherine wheels, a crinkly chip smile, and bits of blue fungi sticking out of his head. And it is that intense, uninhibited, and wildly eccentric vision of the world that the grown-up Kourbaj has appropriated. </p> <p>After painting a couple of thousand tourist portraits to earn a few roubles in Russia, Kourbaj vowed never to paint anyone's face ever again, fled to Mexico and Cuba, and went into a sustained period of abstraction interspersed with landscapes bearing a strange resemblance to naked women. The British Museum bought one of his sketchbooks, but there is a school of thought which maintains that Kourbaj is almost too cool, ethereal and disembodied, culminating in a recent collaboration with Cambridge University's department of aerial photography. He was floating up to heaven. His son's paintings dragged him back down to earth again. </p> <p>Mourad had picked up prizes from Kettle's Yard, in Cambridge, and another in a cafe art competition. Like some superhuman tennis prodigy, he was already overshadowing his old man. Dad decided to give up the struggle and join forces with his son to make a great doubles team. \"The best teachers are those who do not intend to teach,\" Kourbaj says. \"He is as primitive as a caveman. He is not confined by the rectangular.\" </p> <p>Using recycled book covers as canvases, Kourbaj p\u00e8re has extrapolated Kourbaj fils's pre-representational efforts to produce radiant blobs and swirls and squiggles that look like some mad particle physicist grappling with the irreducible elements of the universe. But he has also been softened and humanised by his son's first shots at depicting the world at large, and the exhibition has a separate room dedicated to images of orange cats (with gaping jaws), a doomed bird, impossible machinery, and upside-down trees. \"Mourad did not even know he was painting,\" Kourbaj says. \"He is still surprised by everything.

Breaking off from his shift as a fitter at Port Talbot steelworks in South Wales, he observed the two-minute silence alone, remembering a loss far more immediate than most. </p> <p>In March this year, his son Wayne, a Royal Marines recruit, was shot dead during night manoeuvres on Woodbury Common, Devon. Somehow, for reasons as yet unexplained, live bullets became mixed up with blank ammunition. Two shots fired by a sentry hit Wayne, one in the head, the other in his chest. He was pronounced dead at the scene. </p> <p>Eight months on, Alan is still suffering from weight loss and broken sleep. He firmly believes that his son should never have been placed in such mortal danger. After enlisting in January when still 16, Wayne had spent just nine weeks at the army's commando training camp at Lympstone. He was killed three weeks after his 17th birthday. \"Wayne wasn't a man - he was a boy,\" says Richards. \"He should never have been put in that situation.\" </p> <p>Wayne's name is the most recent addition to the grim roll-call of under-18s who have been killed during military combat or exercises. Since 1982, more than 90 recruits aged 16 or 17 have died on active service, with a further dozen killed during training. This uniquely British statistic led Amnesty International to issue a report last week, U-18s: Child Soldiers at Risk, calling on the government to raise the minimum age of soldiers taking part in armed conflict to 18. </p> <p>\"In Britain, under-18s are not allowed to vote, sign legal documents or drink alcohol, yet growing numbers are being recruited into the dangerous environment of the armed forces,\" says Amnesty spokesman Neil Durkin. \"We want the UK government to give a cast-iron guarantee that no under-18 will ever be sent into dangerous situations for this country.\" </p> <p>While the term \"child soldier\" evokes images of Sierra Leone's West Side Boys dwarfed by their automatic rifles, or pubescent Karen rebels fighting in the Burmese jungle, the UK also deploys troops who are legally still children. With more than 6,500 juveniles in the ranks, Britain recruits more servicemen and women under the age of 18 than any other country in Europe. (France, for example, has fewer than 500.) The UK is also the only European nation routinely to send 17-year-olds into combat zones. Around 200 minors were deployed during the Gulf War (two of whom died), while in Kosovo, 17-year-olds were among the first K-For peacekeepers to enter the capital Pristina. </p> <p>The Ministry of Defence is keen to point out that juveniles join up voluntarily and with their parents' permission. \"As such, it's not like the African countries with kids hacking off limbs,\" says an MoD spokesman. \"It's a completely different end of the spectrum.\" </p> <p>Wayne Richards' grandmother Marion, however, questions the issue of parental consent. \"Alan was against Wayne joining up from the start and refused to sign the documents,\" she says. \"But Wayne's mother signed because he seemed so keen. At the very least, both parents should be required to give their permission.\" </p> <p>Other parents discover too late what they have actually signed. Once enlisted, under-18s have a single opportunity to leave the army, between the second and sixth month of training. After that, they must serve until they are 22. According to At Ease, a confidential advisory service for military personnel, the army's training contract deliberately sets out to confuse parents and children alike. </p> <p>\"The current system is a form of bond-servitude, trapping 16-year-olds into a contract they don't understand and an occupation they can't leave,\" says the organisation's Gwyn Gwyntopher. \"We actually distribute a leaflet translating the Queen's Regulations into plain English, so that kids and their parents fully realise what they are doing. </p> <p>\"Parents, for instance, still believe they can buy their children out if they are unhappy - but that was abolished in 1991. Also, if their kid goes awol and turns up on the parents' doorstep, they can be prosecuted for taking him in or giving him a meal.\" </p> <p>One parent, who wishes to remain anonymous, claims she was assured on three occasions by her local army careers office that no 17-year-old would be sent to fight in the Gulf, only to discover her son of that age had been deployed with the Queen's Own Highlanders. \"He hasn't been the same boy since the day he came back,\" she says. \"I expected him to return a man. Instead, he was totally broken.\" </p> <p>Not all under-18s suffer psychological scars from active service. In 1995, Steven Cowap, then 17, was among a group of Welsh Fusiliers taken hostage by Serbs and held captive for 10 days. He survived the ordeal with no signs of trauma, but admits he was fortunate. \"I wasn't stressed by the situation,\" says Cowap, who is still serving with the regiment. \"But it depends on the individual. Some people at that age are quite mature; others are just kids. Looking back, I was probably thrown in too early.\" </p> <p>Steven's mother Bridie is among those calling for the UK to support a United Nations initiative making 18 the minimum age for recruitment and participation in hostilities. \"For me, the whole nightmare of Steven's hostage situation was made much worse because, in my eyes, he was a baby,\" she explains. \"He was too young to go to war.\" </p> <p>The campaign is also supported by Labour MP Paul Stinchcombe, whose private member's bill to similar effect ran out of parliamentary time earlier this year. \"If recruitment into the services below the age of 18 was thought neither right nor necessary at the time of the first world war, how can it conceivably be thought right or necessary today?\" he asks. </p> <p>So far, though, all moves have been vehemently resisted by a military desperately short of men. Despite a recent upturn in the numbers enlisting, the army is currently around 5,000 men below its full complement, while those who have joined up are increasingly dissatisfied with their lot. Last year, nearly 2,000 service personnel went awol - the highest number since the end of national service. </p> <p>In its efforts to fill the ranks, the army is becoming ever more reliant on under-18s. Despite defence secretary Geoff Hoon's call for an up-to-date army offering an up-to-date career, the recruitment of juveniles has swelled under the present regime to around a third of the total intake, with the number of young recruits increasing twelvefold since 1996. </p> <p>To enlarge the pool of young people yet further, the army is embarking on a massive recruitment drive among under-18s, including the distribution of free videogames (including one entitled Wargasm), open days with such activities as camouflaging and abseiling, and the opening of a second Army Foundation College to educate junior recruits. \"The Army is deliberately targeting 16-year-olds with pretty heavy propaganda,\" says Gwyntopher. \"The kids that succumb don't know what they are getting in to.\" </p> <p>In February, At Ease, along with other interested parties, will submit its assessment of under-18s recruitment to a select committee as part of the Armed Forces Bill, the five-year review that determines military regulations. Though accustomed to having their views rejected, the campaigners have renewed hope that they will prevail. For the family of Wayne Richards, however, any reform will come too late.</p>",

To enlarge the pool of young people yet further, the army is embarking on a massive recruitment drive among under-18s, including the distribution of free videogames (including one entitled Wargasm), open days with such activities as camouflaging and abseiling, and the opening of a second Army Foundation College to educate junior recruits. \"The Army is deliberately targeting 16-year-olds with pretty heavy propaganda,\" says Gwyntopher. \"The kids that succumb don't know what they are getting in to.\" In February, At Ease, along with other interested parties, will submit its assessment of under-18s recruitment to a select committee as part of the Armed Forces Bill, the five-year review that determines military regulations. Though accustomed to having their views rejected, the campaigners have renewed hope that they will prevail. For the family of Wayne Richards, however, any reform will come too late.",

Michelle, my regular stylist, glanced down at my stomach. \"You're pregnant!\" she cheered, letting the whole salon know. \"When are you due?\" </p> <p>I mumbled something I hoped was indistinct. \"Sometime next year... spring... March-ish...\" as though it were an insignificant fact that I hadn't got around to checking up on. </p> <p>She glanced at my stomach again. Michelle has always been blunt. \"You're huge!\" she told the salon: the woman having highlights whose skull sprouted tinfoil spikes, the elderly lady trying to make a few thin strands stretch over a large cranium. </p> <p>\"It's twins,\" I muttered. </p> <p>\"Twins! Twins in the family?\" Michelle asked cheerily. \"No,\" I said. Tinhead and the cranium waited. I have a phrase I have learned to use in such situations: \"They were created by science.\" </p> <p>That evening, I recounted the scene to my mother. It was supposed to be a funny story. My mother did not see it that way. \"Say you have twin cousins,\" she retorted immediately; she had obviously already imagined such an encounter. \"Say that your brother's a twin.\" The family secret must not be shared. </p> <p>The shame of IVF is one thing; at least it rarely runs in the family. But the shame of Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) is quite another. PGD - where IVF is combined with the process of sorting \"good\" embryos from \"bad\" - is necessary because of an inherited condition. If you suffer, your whole family is implicated. Your parents, siblings and even your cousins once and twice removed share in the shame. That is why, for many families with such conditions, it is a closely guarded family secret. Miscarriages are unreported, stillbirths soon forgotten. Only they know what lurks in their genes. </p> <p>Then along come twins and the secret is suddenly out. We are unmasked as other. We can't hide it any more. Either we tell our story, or we are forced to invent further lies. </p> <p>Since the advent of IVF, there has been a remarkable rise in multiple births. From 1982 to 1998, the incidence of twins increased by almost 50%. There are now approximately 10,000 born in the UK every year. And the more multiple the birth, the more staggering the increase. There were 46 sets of quadruplets born worldwide in the first 50 years of the 20th century. Thanks to fertility treatment, there were 79 in 1994 in the US alone. IVF specifically increases your likelihood of having twins to around one in five. </p> <p>There are no separate figures for PGD. Technically we are not infertile; we just have many miscarriages (as in my case), stillbirths, or children who die prematurely. Once unaffected embryos have been chosen, our chances of conceiving should be the same as any other woman's. I had two unaffected embryos replaced in my womb; my chance of both being successfully implanted should have been higher than a woman who had straightforward IVF. But there are no statistics to support this, simply because the sample is so small. Few of us are given access to PGD. In the entire country there have been no more than a dozen children born through the procedure I underwent, and those have all been within the last few years. But a disproportionate number of these are multiple births. </p> <p> 'Of course, we always thought it was twins,\" the nurse told me when the scan showed two furry alien creatures floating around in my womb. Well, of course. It's just that no one had bothered to tell me. The Assisted Conception Unit had confirmed my pregnancy with a blood test. The test had shown the level of my hormones was so high there had to be more than one foetus in there. The nurse knew, the doctors knew, perhaps even the receptionist who filed the results in my cardboard folder knew. But I didn't. I presume the information was hidden from me in order to be reassuring, so as not to raise my hopes. It is now estimated that up to 12% of pregnancies start out as twins, the vast majority becoming singletons before the first scan. But not telling was not reassuring. It only made me concerned about what else might be being withheld. </p> <p>It is as if all of us - the infertile couple, the wider family, the medical staff - are infected with secrets and lies. As a result, we are all alone. PGD patients - and there are so few of us - don't even nod at each other in the waiting room, as though utterly absorbed in last year's Homes &amp; Gardens, bowed over with shame. Elsewhere, it is impossible to spot each other. Perhaps the woman in the hairdressing salon with the tinfoil on her head was infertile, too. Perhaps she had a condition that caused her to miscarry. Or perhaps she had four uncomplicated children, and regarded me as a medical freak. As we each sat silently, shamefully, protecting our secret, I would never know.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Leahwild@cswebmail.com\">Leahwild@cswebmail.com</a></p>",

But the good news is that there's plenty of advice to help organisations comply.</p> <p>The act incorporates a limited version of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law. The convention upholds the right to be treated humanely, to liberty, to freedom of expression and to a fair trial. This means people will be able to seek redress through the British courts rather than take cases to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. </p> <p>The act has been applauded and derided in equal measures. Supporters say the measures offer an overdue form of redress for those who have suffered at the hands of public services, but critics predict that the courts will be clogged with people demanding action on trifling grievances.</p> <p>All public authorities must comply with the conventions, and for the purposes of the act, the term applies to any body - whether it is public or private - that carries out a public function. So, for example, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children is considered to be a public authority as it has powers to protect children and invoke care proceedings. </p> <p>Voluntary organisations which work with agencies to provide government funded services must comply with the conventions. So too do the increasing number of charities that are contracted to provide services on behalf of local authorities or central government. These include charities that provide residential care, hospice care, health care and advice, child care, housing associations, family planning and pregnancy advice centres. </p> <p>The National Council of Voluntary Organisations has drawn up this checklist to help charities gauge how the Human Rights Act will affect them.<br> \u0095 Establish whether your organisation falls within the remit of the act.<br> \u0095 Identify the rights that relate to the parts of your work that are considered public functions. <br>\u0095 Identify whether you are interfering with a convention right or whether that interference could be justified. <br> \u0095 Build a respect for human rights into your organisation's services, employment practices, volunteering policies and procedures.<br> \u0095 Consider the implications of the act for your campaigning, public policy work and communications strategy.</p> <p>According to the Charity Commission, there are a handful of convention rights likely to have the biggest impact on charities. These include:<br> \u0095 <strong>Article 3: the right not to be subjected to torture or inhuman treatment.</strong> This could apply to charities providing hospital or residential care. <br> \u0095<strong> Article 6: the right to a fair trial.</strong> This might affect complaints hearings, tribunals and appeals, and case reviews.<br> \u0095 <strong>Article 8: the right to respect for private and family life.</strong> Any organisation that holds personal information might be affected by this convention.<br> \u0095 <strong> Article 9: freedom of thought, conscience or religion.</strong> This could refer to a care home worker being able to wear a particular form of dress for religious reasons, even if it is out of keeping with the home's uniform. </p> <p>The Charity Commission suggests that any charities unsure as to whether they qualify as public authorities should take legal advice.</p>",

The convention upholds the right to be treated humanely, to liberty, to freedom of expression and to a fair trial. This means people will be able to seek redress through the British courts rather than take cases to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The act has been applauded and derided in equal measures. Supporters say the measures offer an overdue form of redress for those who have suffered at the hands of public services, but critics predict that the courts will be clogged with people demanding action on trifling grievances. All public authorities must comply with the conventions, and for the purposes of the act, the term applies to any body - whether it is public or private - that carries out a public function. So, for example, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children is considered to be a public authority as it has powers to protect children and invoke care proceedings. Voluntary organisations which work with agencies to provide government funded services must comply with the conventions. So too do the increasing number of charities that are contracted to provide services on behalf of local authorities or central government. These include charities that provide residential care, hospice care, health care and advice, child care, housing associations, family planning and pregnancy advice centres. The National Council of Voluntary Organisations has drawn up this checklist to help charities gauge how the Human Rights Act will affect them. \u0095 Establish whether your organisation falls within the remit of the act. \u0095 Identify the rights that relate to the parts of your work that are considered public functions. \u0095 Identify whether you are interfering with a convention right or whether that interference could be justified. \u0095 Build a respect for human rights into your organisation's services, employment practices, volunteering policies and procedures. \u0095 Consider the implications of the act for your campaigning, public policy work and communications strategy. According to the Charity Commission, there are a handful of convention rights likely to have the biggest impact on charities. These include: \u0095 Article 3: the right not to be subjected to torture or inhuman treatment. This could apply to charities providing hospital or residential care. \u0095 Article 6: the right to a fair trial. This might affect complaints hearings, tribunals and appeals, and case reviews. \u0095 Article 8: the right to respect for private and family life. Any organisation that holds personal information might be affected by this convention. \u0095 Article 9: freedom of thought, conscience or religion. This could refer to a care home worker being able to wear a particular form of dress for religious reasons, even if it is out of keeping with the home's uniform. The Charity Commission suggests that any charities unsure as to whether they qualify as public authorities should take legal advice.",

Over half of the 500 voluntary organisations questioned favoured higher direct taxation to pay for the increased spending. Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the NCVO, said: \"The government has a responsibility to foster an environment within which charities can prosper and fulfil their potential as key players in tackling social exclusion and addressing need. \"For this vision to become a reality the future government must acknowledge its responsibility to the sector and make a firm commitment to core funding for charities and voluntary organisations.\" The survey also looked at public spending priorities in areas other than health and social care. The most popular candidates for an increase in public spending were transport and the environment. Conversely, cuts were called for in the defence budget. \u0095 The full details of the survey will be published later this month in the first edition of voluntarysector, the new magazine of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations.",

The building in Tokyo's Nagatacho district is usually the calm control centre of one of the world's most effective political machines, which has held power for all but one of the past 45 years. But it has plunged into a chaos of accusation and counter-accusation since Friday, when LDP heavyweight Koichi Kato made a blatant grab for power by calling for the resignation of his party boss, the prime minister Yoshiro Mori. This revolt has stirred up the Japanese political world like few other events in recent years and prompted pundits to suggest that the country could at last be witnessing the beginning of the end of Mr Mori and, possibly, the LDP.

Health minister John Denham today described the management team at the centre as \"dysfunctional.\" The Lakeland and Carmarthenshire reports are the first to be issued by CHI, which came into being in April.

Fears included the quality of pre and post-operative care, claims that junior doctors were not properly supervised, and allegations that there was a culture of intimidation preventing staff airing their worries.

Carpets, sodden furniture, washing machines and freezers were being thrown into skips, mud hosed out of houses. People knew what to do; it had happened before. Muddy water, runoff from fields planted with winter cereals, had flowed down a normally dry valley and into the houses. Four small dams meant to protect houses filled and overflowed. But much of the damaging flow resulted from a field that bypassed the dams. In this field, a gully 1.5 metre deep and several hundred metres long had been cut in the early hours of 12 October. It discharged hundreds of tons of mud into houses and roads.</p> <p>Bevendean, like other sites around Brighton, has a long history of flooding and serious soil erosion. In 1982 the farmer at Bevendean, on being asked if he had an erosion problem, replied no. He later pointed to a field where he had lost a cow in a gully. Bevendean houses were also flooded in 1985 and 1987.</p> <p>Between 1976 and 1993 there were 60 floodings in the Brighton area. A substantial number will have been added this autumn. In October 1987 at Rottingdean, 3km from Bevendean, around \u00a3400,000 of damage was done to about 30 houses. Half of these costs were borne by household insurers. </p> <p>There is a pattern to the muddy flooding. Almost all incidents occur in the months of October and November, and all involve runoff from fields prepared for, or sown with winter wheat. Because the fields are bare, even moderate amounts of rainfall result in muddy flows leaving the fields by cutting gullies. Farmers often claim that these are 'freak events'. One farmer making this claim was asked when was the previous case of flooding of the nearby village. He replied 'last year'.</p> <p>Over the hill from Bevendean is the well-known vineyard of Breaky Bottom. The farmhouse, built in a dry valley in 1827, was not flooded until 1976. Then again in 1982, 1987 and last month. The muddy-flooding has increased since the slopes up-valley began to be cultivated with cereals. Under grass there was no threat as there was little runoff and no erosion. A series of October floods in 1987 resulted in considerable damage to house and vines and a long-running legal dispute, resulting in undisclosed damages being paid to Peter Hall at Breaky Bottom. The case sought to prove that cultivation of steep slopes for wheat constituted a predictable risk of downvalley flooding. That it was done in the knowledge of the risk, and that nothing had been done to mitigate that risk, and that therefore, land use and farming practices were more responsible than the heavy rain. Central to the case, and others like it, is the assertion that it is how, when and where the valley-slopes are cultivated - not the fact that it rains hard as the main cause of muddy-flood damage. Farmers thus have a responsibility to manage land wisely, including an awareness of downvalley risk of flooding.</p> <p>This is not only a South Downs problem. In other parts of the country where houses are adjacent to farmland, the incidence of muddy-flooding has increased since the adoption of winter cereals in the 1970s. Particularly at risk is the Isle of Wight, Devon, Somerset, Kent and parts of the east and west Midlands. In some areas summer storms have also caused devastation to maize, potatoes or linseed crops, flooding houses in towns such as Faringdon in Oxfordshire and Bishopsteignton in Devon.</p> <p>The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) have recently published a series of advisory booklets for farmers on 'Controlling Soil Erosion'. The 'Soil Code' also devotes several pages to the risks of runoff and erosion. The risk of damage to properties and roads is clearly recognised and farmers are told how to assess that risk. They are advised if the problems are 'regular and severe' to seek further advice and to consider switching to grass. The approach is voluntary, but at least the advice is now freely available.</p> <p>There are success stories that show how property can be protected from muddy floods. At Rottingdean, a deal between the farmer and his landlord Brighton Borough Council led to a reduction in the area of cereals and the construction of a substantial dam. There has been no flooding since 1987. At Sompting near Worthing, after several repeated muddy-floods of houses, the farmer constructed small dams and put areas of the catchment under grass using through Set Aside payments. No property damage has occurred since 1993. Such examples of good practice in preventing muddy-floods need to be more widely known. In the southern Netherlands, Belgium and northern France, radical approaches involving co-operation between local communities, farmers, and EU funding have begun to make progress in providing protection.</p> <p>Recent media reports have linked flooding in southeastern England to climate change. There is certainly an element of storms and exceptional rainfall, but housing developments on floodplains have also contributed to the catalogue of damage.

      "bodyText": "There is no river anywhere near, but last week the Brighton suburb of Bevendean was drying out after a flood. Carpets, sodden furniture, washing machines and freezers were being thrown into skips, mud hosed out of houses. People knew what to do; it had happened before. Muddy water, runoff from fields planted with winter cereals, had flowed down a normally dry valley and into the houses. Four small dams meant to protect houses filled and overflowed. But much of the damaging flow resulted from a field that bypassed the dams. In this field, a gully 1.5 metre deep and several hundred metres long had been cut in the early hours of 12 October. It discharged hundreds of tons of mud into houses and roads. Bevendean, like other sites around Brighton, has a long history of flooding and serious soil erosion. In 1982 the farmer at Bevendean, on being asked if he had an erosion problem, replied no. He later pointed to a field where he had lost a cow in a gully. Bevendean houses were also flooded in 1985 and 1987. Between 1976 and 1993 there were 60 floodings in the Brighton area. A substantial number will have been added this autumn. In October 1987 at Rottingdean, 3km from Bevendean, around \u00a3400,000 of damage was done to about 30 houses. Half of these costs were borne by household insurers. There is a pattern to the muddy flooding. Almost all incidents occur in the months of October and November, and all involve runoff from fields prepared for, or sown with winter wheat. Because the fields are bare, even moderate amounts of rainfall result in muddy flows leaving the fields by cutting gullies. Farmers often claim that these are 'freak events'. One farmer making this claim was asked when was the previous case of flooding of the nearby village. He replied 'last year'. Over the hill from Bevendean is the well-known vineyard of Breaky Bottom. The farmhouse, built in a dry valley in 1827, was not flooded until 1976. Then again in 1982, 1987 and last month. The muddy-flooding has increased since the slopes up-valley began to be cultivated with cereals. Under grass there was no threat as there was little runoff and no erosion. A series of October floods in 1987 resulted in considerable damage to house and vines and a long-running legal dispute, resulting in undisclosed damages being paid to Peter Hall at Breaky Bottom. The case sought to prove that cultivation of steep slopes for wheat constituted a predictable risk of downvalley flooding. That it was done in the knowledge of the risk, and that nothing had been done to mitigate that risk, and that therefore, land use and farming practices were more responsible than the heavy rain. Central to the case, and others like it, is the assertion that it is how, when and where the valley-slopes are cultivated - not the fact that it rains hard as the main cause of muddy-flood damage. Farmers thus have a responsibility to manage land wisely, including an awareness of downvalley risk of flooding. This is not only a South Downs problem. In other parts of the country where houses are adjacent to farmland, the incidence of muddy-flooding has increased since the adoption of winter cereals in the 1970s. Particularly at risk is the Isle of Wight, Devon, Somerset, Kent and parts of the east and west Midlands. In some areas summer storms have also caused devastation to maize, potatoes or linseed crops, flooding houses in towns such as Faringdon in Oxfordshire and Bishopsteignton in Devon. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) have recently published a series of advisory booklets for farmers on 'Controlling Soil Erosion'. The 'Soil Code' also devotes several pages to the risks of runoff and erosion. The risk of damage to properties and roads is clearly recognised and farmers are told how to assess that risk. They are advised if the problems are 'regular and severe' to seek further advice and to consider switching to grass. The approach is voluntary, but at least the advice is now freely available. There are success stories that show how property can be protected from muddy floods. At Rottingdean, a deal between the farmer and his landlord Brighton Borough Council led to a reduction in the area of cereals and the construction of a substantial dam. There has been no flooding since 1987. At Sompting near Worthing, after several repeated muddy-floods of houses, the farmer constructed small dams and put areas of the catchment under grass using through Set Aside payments. No property damage has occurred since 1993. Such examples of good practice in preventing muddy-floods need to be more widely known. In the southern Netherlands, Belgium and northern France, radical approaches involving co-operation between local communities, farmers, and EU funding have begun to make progress in providing protection. Recent media reports have linked flooding in southeastern England to climate change. There is certainly an element of storms and exceptional rainfall, but housing developments on floodplains have also contributed to the catalogue of damage. Floodplains are meant to provide a natural service by storing water like a sponge - not be cluttered with houses. With the issue of runoff from agricultural land, it is easy to demonstrate that landuse is critically important. Damage occurs where property is in close proximity to bare cultivated fields, and these sites are quite predictable.

Who was the most successful?\"</strong></p> <p>Step forward one Florin Valeriu Raducioiu, who like the kid who can manage three Shredded Wheat, boasts a travelling record many players would envy. After playing for five seasons at Dinamo Bucharest, the Harvey Nicks regular spent four years in Italy (with Bari, Verona, Brescia and Milan), two years in Spain (with Espanyol), that season at West Ham and also a year at Stuttgart - before going back to Espanyol and then Brescia. Cheers to Duncan Young for the spot.</p> <p>Other players have also been suggested - notably Stefan Schwarz (Fiorentina, Valencia, Arsenal/Sunderland and Bayer Leverkusen). However, hats off to Simon Lindberg who, after originally suggesting the Swedish midfielder, decided to phone up \"the people at his Swedish club Malmo\" to make sure. They confirmed that while Schwarz was at Leverkusen, he was merely a trainee and never played. \"I hope I haven't caused any troubles since I am a big fan of Knowledge Unlimited,\" says Simon.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Duncan Young points out that several players have managed three clubs in the big four countries, including: Jurgen Klinsmann (Tottenham, Sampdoria, Stuttgart); Allan Simonsen (Charlton, Borussia Moenchengladbach and Barcelona); Savo Milosevic (Villa, Zaragoza, Parma); Karlheinz Riedle (Dortmund, Lazio, Liverpool); Mark Hughes (Man U, Barcelona, Bayern Munich); Darko Kovacevic (Sheffield Wednesday, Sociedad, Juventus); Brian Laudrup (Bayern Munich, Fiorentina, Chelsea); Bryan Roy (Nottm Forest, Foggia, Hertha Berlin); Martin Dahlin (Borussia Moenchengladbach, Blackburn, Roma); Christian Karembeu (Sampdoria, Real Madrid, Middlesbrough); Paulo Futre (West Ham, Atletico Madrid, Reggiana); Alojsa Asanovic (Valladolid, Derby, Napoli); and Mario Stanic (Gijon, Parma, Chelsea).</p> <p><strong>WHAT A REFRESHING TACTIC</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Can anyone explain the archaic tactic of 'metodo', beloved of the Austrian side of the 1950s I believe?\"</strong> asks Liam Arthur.</p> <p>During football's formative years, attack was the name of the game. The barnstorming 2-3-5 formation was king, while the classic W-M formation - used by England after the war - was merely a glint in Walter Winterbottom's eye. But during the 1930s, Italy coach Vittorio Pozzo was formulating an idea which was to become known as the Italian metodo.</p> <p>Pozzo decided that 2-3-5 was just a little bit too bold and decided to pull his two inside-forwards back into midfield, making a sort of 2-3-2-3 formation. Five men in midfield obviously worked, as Italy won successive World Cups in 1934 and 1938 and Pozzo was hailed as a tactical genius. </p> <p>Incidentally, before the 1938 World Cup, fascist dictator Benito Mussolini sent a telegram to Pozzo which said \"win or die\". Fortunately for the creator of metodo, Italy beat Hungary 4-2 in the final.</p> <p><strong>HOMER - D'OH!</strong></p> <p><strong>Were Fenerbahce the first team to beat Manchester United in the Champions League at home?</strong> asks John Stewart</p> <p>The Turks weren't just the first team to beat Manchester United at home in the Competition Formerly Known As European Cup. By winning 1-0 in Group C of the Champions League in October 1996, they ended United's 40-year unbeaten home record in all European competition.</p> <p>The damage was done by Elvir Bolic, who broke down the left wing in the 76th minute of a dull game and walloped a shot which deflected off David May and over Peter Schmeichel into the net.</p> <p>Sure enough, having lost at home in Europe for the first time in 40 years, United took only 14 days to repeat the feat. A penalty from Allesandro Del Piero was enough to give eventual finalists Juventus a 1-0 win.</p> <p><strong>PUTTING IT ON YOUR SHIRT</strong></p> <p><strong>Last week we explained how Kettering Town became the first British club to run out with a company's name emblazoned on their shirts, which - not surprisingly - got many of you reminiscing fondly about those early days of kit advertising.</strong></p> <p>\"I recall when I was with the Daily Express in Manchester, going to a Bolton match (circa 1980) and they were sponsored by the local paper, the Bolton Evening News. Since they used only the initials every player in the team appeared to be named BEN,\" remembers Len Findlay, who now works in Australia.</p> <p>This is disputed by the club, however, who can only remember as far back as their sponsors for the 1981 season Knights Security.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Paddy Dwyer says he can remember an edition of Roy of the Rovers \"from some time in the late seventies in which Melchester Rovers were getting ready for one of the invariably vital games they played.</p> <p>\"The company name Gola was emblazoned across their shirts and, as they put them on, one of the players said to Roy: 'What's this, shouldn't it say Goal?' Even at age eight, I thought to myself 'Jesus, what a twat'. It's good to know footballers in comics are just as thick as their real life counterparts.\"</p> <p><strong>EMILE \"SCRATCH\" HESKEY</strong></p> <p><strong>\"So what's that scratching thing that Emile Heskey does every time he scores a goal then?\"</strong> asks Dr Adam Marshall. <strong>\"He's not turning his hand to music is he?\"</strong></p> <p>Sadly Dr Adam, our prognosis is that Emile is not the music man. Indeed, according to sources close to Liverpool Football Club, Emile is doing nothing more than an impression of a dance DJ (popular amongst the youth). This impression consists of listening to an imaginary song on imaginary headphones - hence the left hand placed against the ear - while spinning back said imaginary track with the right hand (the rewind, as it is known) for the delectation of the crowd.</p> <p>However, scholars of the 'rap scene' insist that Emile is 'scratching' with his right hand, the process by which DJs grind their records into dust, and also the means by which 5ive created the \"wiggy wiggy\" noise on their recent number one hit 'We Will Rock You.'</p> <p><strong>WOLFSBURG'S WOLFGANG WOLF</strong></p> <p><strong>Can you confirm that the manager of [Bundesliga side] Wolfsburg is called Wolfgang Wolf?</strong> asks Stefan Schnoor (which could possibly be an alias)</p> <p>It sounds ridiculous. And it is. But it's also true.</p> <p><strong> CAN YOU HELP? </strong></p> <p>\"Is Raul the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the Champions League?\" asks John Stewart.</p> <p>\"What percentage of the games that Chelsea have lost over the last three seasons have they been without Marcel Desailly for? Surely he is the key link to this teams current success?\" reckons Gavin Gray.</p> <p>Anyone who knows can mail their answer to <a href=\"mailto: the.boss@theguardian.com\">the.boss@theguardian.com</a>.

      "bodyText": "WELL-TRAVELLED FOOTBALLERS \"Has anyone played for a First Division side in each of the big four European leagues (Italy, Spain, England, Germany)?\" asks Paul Carek. \"If so, who was the last to do it? Who was the most successful?\" Step forward one Florin Valeriu Raducioiu, who like the kid who can manage three Shredded Wheat, boasts a travelling record many players would envy. After playing for five seasons at Dinamo Bucharest, the Harvey Nicks regular spent four years in Italy (with Bari, Verona, Brescia and Milan), two years in Spain (with Espanyol), that season at West Ham and also a year at Stuttgart - before going back to Espanyol and then Brescia. Cheers to Duncan Young for the spot. Other players have also been suggested - notably Stefan Schwarz (Fiorentina, Valencia, Arsenal/Sunderland and Bayer Leverkusen). However, hats off to Simon Lindberg who, after originally suggesting the Swedish midfielder, decided to phone up \"the people at his Swedish club Malmo\" to make sure. They confirmed that while Schwarz was at Leverkusen, he was merely a trainee and never played. \"I hope I haven't caused any troubles since I am a big fan of Knowledge Unlimited,\" says Simon. Meanwhile, Duncan Young points out that several players have managed three clubs in the big four countries, including: Jurgen Klinsmann (Tottenham, Sampdoria, Stuttgart); Allan Simonsen (Charlton, Borussia Moenchengladbach and Barcelona); Savo Milosevic (Villa, Zaragoza, Parma); Karlheinz Riedle (Dortmund, Lazio, Liverpool); Mark Hughes (Man U, Barcelona, Bayern Munich); Darko Kovacevic (Sheffield Wednesday, Sociedad, Juventus); Brian Laudrup (Bayern Munich, Fiorentina, Chelsea); Bryan Roy (Nottm Forest, Foggia, Hertha Berlin); Martin Dahlin (Borussia Moenchengladbach, Blackburn, Roma); Christian Karembeu (Sampdoria, Real Madrid, Middlesbrough); Paulo Futre (West Ham, Atletico Madrid, Reggiana); Alojsa Asanovic (Valladolid, Derby, Napoli); and Mario Stanic (Gijon, Parma, Chelsea). WHAT A REFRESHING TACTIC \"Can anyone explain the archaic tactic of 'metodo', beloved of the Austrian side of the 1950s I believe?\" asks Liam Arthur. During football's formative years, attack was the name of the game. The barnstorming 2-3-5 formation was king, while the classic W-M formation - used by England after the war - was merely a glint in Walter Winterbottom's eye. But during the 1930s, Italy coach Vittorio Pozzo was formulating an idea which was to become known as the Italian metodo. Pozzo decided that 2-3-5 was just a little bit too bold and decided to pull his two inside-forwards back into midfield, making a sort of 2-3-2-3 formation. Five men in midfield obviously worked, as Italy won successive World Cups in 1934 and 1938 and Pozzo was hailed as a tactical genius. Incidentally, before the 1938 World Cup, fascist dictator Benito Mussolini sent a telegram to Pozzo which said \"win or die\". Fortunately for the creator of metodo, Italy beat Hungary 4-2 in the final. HOMER - D'OH! Were Fenerbahce the first team to beat Manchester United in the Champions League at home? asks John Stewart The Turks weren't just the first team to beat Manchester United at home in the Competition Formerly Known As European Cup. By winning 1-0 in Group C of the Champions League in October 1996, they ended United's 40-year unbeaten home record in all European competition. The damage was done by Elvir Bolic, who broke down the left wing in the 76th minute of a dull game and walloped a shot which deflected off David May and over Peter Schmeichel into the net. Sure enough, having lost at home in Europe for the first time in 40 years, United took only 14 days to repeat the feat. A penalty from Allesandro Del Piero was enough to give eventual finalists Juventus a 1-0 win. PUTTING IT ON YOUR SHIRT Last week we explained how Kettering Town became the first British club to run out with a company's name emblazoned on their shirts, which - not surprisingly - got many of you reminiscing fondly about those early days of kit advertising. \"I recall when I was with the Daily Express in Manchester, going to a Bolton match (circa 1980) and they were sponsored by the local paper, the Bolton Evening News. Since they used only the initials every player in the team appeared to be named BEN,\" remembers Len Findlay, who now works in Australia. This is disputed by the club, however, who can only remember as far back as their sponsors for the 1981 season Knights Security. Meanwhile, Paddy Dwyer says he can remember an edition of Roy of the Rovers \"from some time in the late seventies in which Melchester Rovers were getting ready for one of the invariably vital games they played. \"The company name Gola was emblazoned across their shirts and, as they put them on, one of the players said to Roy: 'What's this, shouldn't it say Goal?' Even at age eight, I thought to myself 'Jesus, what a twat'. It's good to know footballers in comics are just as thick as their real life counterparts.\" EMILE \"SCRATCH\" HESKEY \"So what's that scratching thing that Emile Heskey does every time he scores a goal then?\" asks Dr Adam Marshall. \"He's not turning his hand to music is he?\" Sadly Dr Adam, our prognosis is that Emile is not the music man. Indeed, according to sources close to Liverpool Football Club, Emile is doing nothing more than an impression of a dance DJ (popular amongst the youth). This impression consists of listening to an imaginary song on imaginary headphones - hence the left hand placed against the ear - while spinning back said imaginary track with the right hand (the rewind, as it is known) for the delectation of the crowd. However, scholars of the 'rap scene' insist that Emile is 'scratching' with his right hand, the process by which DJs grind their records into dust, and also the means by which 5ive created the \"wiggy wiggy\" noise on their recent number one hit 'We Will Rock You.' WOLFSBURG'S WOLFGANG WOLF Can you confirm that the manager of [Bundesliga side] Wolfsburg is called Wolfgang Wolf? asks Stefan Schnoor (which could possibly be an alias) It sounds ridiculous. And it is. But it's also true. CAN YOU HELP? \"Is Raul the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the Champions League?\" asks John Stewart. \"What percentage of the games that Chelsea have lost over the last three seasons have they been without Marcel Desailly for? Surely he is the key link to this teams current success?\" reckons Gavin Gray. Anyone who knows can mail their answer to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can use the same address to send your questions: we'll do our best to answer them.",

      "body": "<p>The race for commercial control over the essence of life is threatening to spiral out of control with private firms, universities and charities claiming exclusive development rights over natural processes in the human body at the rate of 34,500 a month. </p> <p>For the first time, research commissioned by the Guardian reveals the awesome scale of the gene rush, as investors, scientists, entrepreneurs and lawyers use powerful new technology and obscure new laws to isolate and patent the genes which make us what we are - before they even understand what the genes do. </p> <p>Biotech firms say they need patent protection to recoup their investments.

For the first time, research commissioned by the Guardian reveals the awesome scale of the gene rush, as investors, scientists, entrepreneurs and lawyers use powerful new technology and obscure new laws to isolate and patent the genes which make us what we are - before they even understand what the genes do. Biotech firms say they need patent protection to recoup their investments. But the risk to society is that future medical researchers - private and public - will have to hack their way through forests of patents, paying out hefty licence fees to a host of gene-squatters, before the miracle drugs of the genetics revolution reach the market. \"It's like someone buying a street and taking a toll from everybody passing through,\" said Thomas Schweiger, of German Greenpeace, which is campaigning against gene patenting.

But what will scientists and technologists have achieved in the intervening years? What will be the challenges in developing the energy-efficient technologies needed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions? </p> <p>By looking at recent developments in the UK and elsewhere, we can confidently predict that public attitudes towards government sustainability policies will have been expressed at the ballot box, and perhaps even in the streets. The UK has had a recently unprecedented 'fuel crisis' as truck drivers and other road users protested against partly environmental taxes. Within the past year, international demonstrators have protested in Seattle against the globalisation policies of the WTO, and in Prague to the IMF and the World Bank. Climate change demands global policies and global action - the purpose of COP6 and the Kyoto Protocol.</p> <p>The eight years since the 1992 United Nations Biodiversity Summit in Rio have demonstrated spectacularly what governments around the world can do individually and collaboratively to tackle the unprecedented problem of global change. But we also have some pointers as to what cannot be done by this top-down approach to policy implementation. We have learnt that society does not adopt sustainable practices and innovative technology through legislation alone. For a sustainable future, success or failure lies as much in the hands of society as in governments and their legislation. In Europe, 70% of housing does not have a single energy-efficient light bulb yet they benefit the householder by reducing their electricity bills. </p> <p>In the search for a lower-carbon future, science, business, and industry occupy the territory linking government and citizen. They innovate the technology and services that can achieve sustainability through the consumer market place. There is ample evidence in universities around the world and at the technology exhibition currently at COP6 of an abundance of innovation both for moderation of carbon dioxide outputs and for adaptation to climate change. Acceptance of sustainable technology into the market place and conquering the risks of climate change call for the development of new relationships between business, industry, innovative universities and consumers. Sustainable technology needs more than innovative ideas. It requires public dialogue to transform society towards an energy-efficient market place and to produce lasting climate change solutions. </p> <p>The world is currently short of the types of organisations, mechanisms and representative groups that are likely to be required for this change of mind set. So just as universities have a role in technological innovation and solving of environmental problems, we also have a developing role in awareness and communication. Not only do universities need improved links with technologists and businesses; we also want dialogue with society and citizens. </p> <p>Scientists and society alike have to realise that the benefits of responding to global change are not only altruistic towards future generations. The adoption of sustainable technology often brings immediate advantages in convenience, product quality, and finance. World-class universities like Oxford have a developing role as centres of impartial dialogue linking innovation, solution technology, and wider society.

      "bodyText": "In five years time our world will be different. We'll all be older and hopefully a little wiser. And pressing climate change issues will still be with us. But what will scientists and technologists have achieved in the intervening years? What will be the challenges in developing the energy-efficient technologies needed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions? By looking at recent developments in the UK and elsewhere, we can confidently predict that public attitudes towards government sustainability policies will have been expressed at the ballot box, and perhaps even in the streets. The UK has had a recently unprecedented 'fuel crisis' as truck drivers and other road users protested against partly environmental taxes. Within the past year, international demonstrators have protested in Seattle against the globalisation policies of the WTO, and in Prague to the IMF and the World Bank. Climate change demands global policies and global action - the purpose of COP6 and the Kyoto Protocol. The eight years since the 1992 United Nations Biodiversity Summit in Rio have demonstrated spectacularly what governments around the world can do individually and collaboratively to tackle the unprecedented problem of global change. But we also have some pointers as to what cannot be done by this top-down approach to policy implementation. We have learnt that society does not adopt sustainable practices and innovative technology through legislation alone. For a sustainable future, success or failure lies as much in the hands of society as in governments and their legislation. In Europe, 70% of housing does not have a single energy-efficient light bulb yet they benefit the householder by reducing their electricity bills. In the search for a lower-carbon future, science, business, and industry occupy the territory linking government and citizen. They innovate the technology and services that can achieve sustainability through the consumer market place. There is ample evidence in universities around the world and at the technology exhibition currently at COP6 of an abundance of innovation both for moderation of carbon dioxide outputs and for adaptation to climate change. Acceptance of sustainable technology into the market place and conquering the risks of climate change call for the development of new relationships between business, industry, innovative universities and consumers. Sustainable technology needs more than innovative ideas. It requires public dialogue to transform society towards an energy-efficient market place and to produce lasting climate change solutions. The world is currently short of the types of organisations, mechanisms and representative groups that are likely to be required for this change of mind set. So just as universities have a role in technological innovation and solving of environmental problems, we also have a developing role in awareness and communication. Not only do universities need improved links with technologists and businesses; we also want dialogue with society and citizens. Scientists and society alike have to realise that the benefits of responding to global change are not only altruistic towards future generations. The adoption of sustainable technology often brings immediate advantages in convenience, product quality, and finance. World-class universities like Oxford have a developing role as centres of impartial dialogue linking innovation, solution technology, and wider society. Science and society needs to move forward with this process, and we need to find the mechanisms for this sea change to happen. Sustainable technology might then become a lasting solution to moderating climate change. Without societal support and acceptance, \u00d4sustainable technology\u00d5 will remain a phrase for innovation without customers.

It has emerged that Lord Alli has talked to Mr Evans about a creating a consortium to bid for the paper, which is thought to include Matthew Freud, boss of PR company Freud Communications. Lord Alli, who is leaving his job as managing director of Carlton Productions, has been approached by a venture capital firm about launching a bid for the paper, which would be transformed into a sports and showbusiness daily. A source close to Mr Evans admitted that the pair have reopened talks about creating a \"special interest, entertainment tabloid\". \"If Waheed wanted to formalise this bid,\" the source added, \"you would see a group of eclectic people working together on this to create a special interest magazine along the lines of the football titles we've seen more of recently.\" Both Mr Evans and Lord Alli want to radically overhaul the paper, taking it away from its dated working class tabloid format but retaining the elements that have kept it selling over 500,000 copies a day. Mr Evans, who has often said that he would be interested in buying the Star, approached Lord Hollick early in 1999 with a proposal to swap stock in his compan,y Ginger Media Group. But the deal fell through after Apax Partners, part-shareholders in Ginger Media and Mr Evans' venture capital backers, backed away from the deal. Any bid for the Daily Star would hinge on the sale of the Express newspaper group. Formal bids have been launched by Daily Mail &amp; General Trust and the HindujabBrothers, although Daily Telegraph-owner Hollinger and former Mirror Group chief executive David Montgomery have also expressed an interest. The Hinduja brothers in particular are keen to offload the Star, which is at odds with their Hindu religious views. A spokesman for the Hindujas said: \"It's an interesting idea,\" but added that the brothers were focused on buying the Express first. It is thought that any consortium including Lord Alli and Mr Evans would not launch a formal bid until after the sale of the Express Newspapers has been resolved.

Under Briscoe's administrative leadership, the organisation has become an impressive political machine, writing policy as well as influencing it.</p> <p>Despite some criticism of its reluctance to publicly spar with the government, the association has scored notable successes, coming up with the concept of local public service agreements and seeing off attempts to bypass councils in school funding.</p> <p>Briscoe has had to work hard to keep the association's party groups on board, but it is a job for which the former chief executive of a Conservative-led Hertfordshire county council is well qualified. </p> <p>His ability to work across the party spectrum is vital, as his power stems from his elected masters, and the association's successes have been built on his partnership with LGA chairman Sir Jeremy Beecham.</p> <p>Despite this, Briscoe's role as a broker between councillors, ministers and the civil service has cemented his position as local government's fixer-in-chief. A recent contract renewal means he is likely to remain at the top of lists like these for some time.</p> <p><strong>2. Sir Jeremy Beecham</strong><br>Chairman, Local Government Association<br><a href=\"http://www.lga.gov.uk/\">LGAnet</a><br> Far and away the country's leading local politician, has successfully walked a fine line between influencing and infuriating his Labour colleagues, acting as both critical friend to the government and party insider through his membership of Labour's national executive committee. Slick political performance combined with a readiness to attack ministers when necessary means he commands respect across the political spectrum. Like Brian Briscoe, has led the LGA since its creation, and shares the credit for turning it into an effective political machine. Led Newcastle city council for 17 years and chaired the Association of Metropolitan Authorities before it entered the LGA. </p> <p><strong>3. Dr Wendy Thomson</strong><br>Head of inspection, Audit Commission<br><a href=\"http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/\">The Audit Commission</a><br> As the human face of the government's \"best value\" continuous improvement programme for local government through her role in checking whether councils are adhering to its regime, she is able to command the respect of apprehensive local authorities and is regarded as essential to the regime's success. Ministers pressured her to stay on at the commission instead of running for chief executive of the Greater London Authority. The former London Borough of Newham chief executive is hotly tipped to succeed Andrew Foster as the commission's controller.</p> <p><strong>4. Mel Usher</strong><br> Executive director, Improvement and Development Agency<br><a href=\"http://www.idea.gov.uk/\">IDeA Online</a><br> Is leading the fight to improve council service standards. Despite launching only last year, the IDeA has rapidly established itself as one of local government's most dynamic and successful institutions, and is becoming increasingly entrepreneurial. </p> <p><strong>5. John Stewart</strong><br>Professor of local government and administration, Institute for Local Government Studies<br><a href=\"http://spp3.bham.ac.uk/DLGS/Homepage.htm\">INLOGOV</a><br> While other local government academics analyse the political agenda, he sets it. May not always be in favour with ministers, but leading edge work means his influence stretches far beyond Whitehall. Has probably helped form the world views of most people on this list.</p> <p><strong>6. Oonagh Aitken</strong><br> Chief executive, Convention of Scottish Local Authorities<br><a href=\"http://www.cosla.gov.uk/\">COSLA</a><br> One of the key links in the enviably close relationship between Scottish local and central government. This former teacher has an impressive local government track record, including a spell as assistant chief executive of Glasgow council and work in education, social services, housing and Europe.</p> <p><strong>7. Lord Filkin</strong><br> Non-executive director of the New Local Government Network and chair of the beacon council advisory panel<br><a href=\"http://www.nlgn.org.uk\">New Local Government Network</a><br> Said to be Tony Blair's favourite local government adviser, has influenced the modernisation agenda through insider relationships with ministers and his position as one of the chief ideolgues of the New Local Government Network think tank.</p> <p><strong>8. Ken Livingstone</strong><br>Mayor of London<br><a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/\">London.gov.uk</a><br> Has power to affect the future of the capital and its councils, including direct ability to intervene in London planning and transport. His huge personal mandate means he is also in a position to bully local authorities and central government into getting things done.</p> <p><strong>9. Sir Robin Wales</strong><br>Leader, London Borough of Newham<br><a href=\"http://www.newham.gov.uk/\">London Borough of Newham</a><br> As chairman of the Association of London Government, he speaks with a national voice, and his developing relationship with mayor Ken Livingstone is being watched carefully by authorities across the capital.

      "bodyText": "1. Brian Briscoe Chief executive, Local Government Association LGAnet Head of the LGA since its inception in 1997, he can take much of the credit for forging disparate council associations into a cohesive and effective whole that speaks for local government and commands the ear of ministers. Under Briscoe's administrative leadership, the organisation has become an impressive political machine, writing policy as well as influencing it. Despite some criticism of its reluctance to publicly spar with the government, the association has scored notable successes, coming up with the concept of local public service agreements and seeing off attempts to bypass councils in school funding. Briscoe has had to work hard to keep the association's party groups on board, but it is a job for which the former chief executive of a Conservative-led Hertfordshire county council is well qualified. His ability to work across the party spectrum is vital, as his power stems from his elected masters, and the association's successes have been built on his partnership with LGA chairman Sir Jeremy Beecham. Despite this, Briscoe's role as a broker between councillors, ministers and the civil service has cemented his position as local government's fixer-in-chief. A recent contract renewal means he is likely to remain at the top of lists like these for some time. 2. Sir Jeremy Beecham Chairman, Local Government Association LGAnet Far and away the country's leading local politician, has successfully walked a fine line between influencing and infuriating his Labour colleagues, acting as both critical friend to the government and party insider through his membership of Labour's national executive committee. Slick political performance combined with a readiness to attack ministers when necessary means he commands respect across the political spectrum. Like Brian Briscoe, has led the LGA since its creation, and shares the credit for turning it into an effective political machine. Led Newcastle city council for 17 years and chaired the Association of Metropolitan Authorities before it entered the LGA. 3. Dr Wendy Thomson Head of inspection, Audit Commission The Audit Commission As the human face of the government's \"best value\" continuous improvement programme for local government through her role in checking whether councils are adhering to its regime, she is able to command the respect of apprehensive local authorities and is regarded as essential to the regime's success. Ministers pressured her to stay on at the commission instead of running for chief executive of the Greater London Authority. The former London Borough of Newham chief executive is hotly tipped to succeed Andrew Foster as the commission's controller. 4. Mel Usher Executive director, Improvement and Development Agency IDeA Online Is leading the fight to improve council service standards. Despite launching only last year, the IDeA has rapidly established itself as one of local government's most dynamic and successful institutions, and is becoming increasingly entrepreneurial. 5. John Stewart Professor of local government and administration, Institute for Local Government Studies INLOGOV While other local government academics analyse the political agenda, he sets it. May not always be in favour with ministers, but leading edge work means his influence stretches far beyond Whitehall. Has probably helped form the world views of most people on this list. 6. Oonagh Aitken Chief executive, Convention of Scottish Local Authorities COSLA One of the key links in the enviably close relationship between Scottish local and central government. This former teacher has an impressive local government track record, including a spell as assistant chief executive of Glasgow council and work in education, social services, housing and Europe. 7. Lord Filkin Non-executive director of the New Local Government Network and chair of the beacon council advisory panel New Local Government Network Said to be Tony Blair's favourite local government adviser, has influenced the modernisation agenda through insider relationships with ministers and his position as one of the chief ideolgues of the New Local Government Network think tank. 8. Ken Livingstone Mayor of London London.gov.uk Has power to affect the future of the capital and its councils, including direct ability to intervene in London planning and transport. His huge personal mandate means he is also in a position to bully local authorities and central government into getting things done. 9. Sir Robin Wales Leader, London Borough of Newham London Borough of Newham As chairman of the Association of London Government, he speaks with a national voice, and his developing relationship with mayor Ken Livingstone is being watched carefully by authorities across the capital. A relatively young member of the local government aristocracy, his reputation is largely based on the improvements he and Wendy Thomson achieved in Newham. 10. Albert Bore Leader, Birmingham City Council Birmingham Assist In five years' time, will probably be seen as the man who led a mayoral revolution in England and Wales. By steering his divided authority into a referendum on direct elections for the job of mayor, is already putting pressure on other large urban councils to follow suit. Likely to stand in any mayoral election that follows and could provide a role model for aspiring Labour city bosses. 11. Andrew Foster Controller, Audit Commission The Audit Commission Power extends across the public sector. Influence on local government may have been eclipsed by the rise of Wendy Thomson, who many believe is destined to replace him at the top of the commission. Until she does, Foster still calls many of the shots that matter. 12. Gerry Stoker Chair, New Local Government Network New Local Government Network Seen as a controversialist by some, but the government has taken the University of Manchester academic to its heart, and he has played an important role in the modernisation drive. 13. David Henshaw Chief executive, Liverpool City Council Liverpool City Council As president of the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives, he must steer council bosses through a difficult period of political change, redefining the role of senior officers in relation to newly powerful politicians. Is launching a regeneration package in Liverpool to revive a city in the doldrums since the Militant era. 14.

Forward-looking attitude and strongly held opinions have won him a national profile that some of his party's front benchers will envy. Tipped as a future chairman of the Local Government Association. 15.

      "body": "<p>The prime minister, Tony Blair, was today facing one of the biggest backbench rebellions of his premiership, amid anger over government proposals to partly privatise the national air traffic control system.</p> <p>Dozens of Labour MPs, who are worried about safety under the new system, are expected to vote against the government when the Commons considers a Lords amendment designed to keep it in wholly public hands.</p> <p>In July, 47 Labour MPs broke ranks to vote against the government's proposals, which it has insisted would leave safety as the paramount issue. A further two dozen MPs pointedly abstained.</p> <p>Unions representing air traffic controllers and airline pilots were today due to lobby Parliament to urge MPs not to allow the plan to go through.</p> <p>And Martin Salter, MP for Reading West, who has led the revolt, said that he would again be calling for fellow backbenchers to vote against the government.</p> <p>He said: \"After the Hatfield and Paddington rail disasters, opinion seems to be hardening against these ill-thought-out privatisation proposals.</p> <p>\"Recent opinion polls now show 76% of the public against only 14% in favour, making the air sell-off even more unpopular than fox-hunting.</p> <p>\"It's difficult to find even the most serial loyalist to approve of the plans, and I'm calling on the government to listen to its own supporters, not only on the backbenches but out in the country to pull back now before it is too late.\"</p> <p>Fellow Labour backbencher Gordon Prentice, MP for Pendle, said: \"The Nats proposals were not in Labour's manifesto and there is no compelling financial reason why we need to do this.</p> <p>\"The air traffic controllers don't want it and neither do the pilots.

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Tony Blair, was today facing one of the biggest backbench rebellions of his premiership, amid anger over government proposals to partly privatise the national air traffic control system. Dozens of Labour MPs, who are worried about safety under the new system, are expected to vote against the government when the Commons considers a Lords amendment designed to keep it in wholly public hands. In July, 47 Labour MPs broke ranks to vote against the government's proposals, which it has insisted would leave safety as the paramount issue. A further two dozen MPs pointedly abstained. Unions representing air traffic controllers and airline pilots were today due to lobby Parliament to urge MPs not to allow the plan to go through. And Martin Salter, MP for Reading West, who has led the revolt, said that he would again be calling for fellow backbenchers to vote against the government. He said: \"After the Hatfield and Paddington rail disasters, opinion seems to be hardening against these ill-thought-out privatisation proposals. \"Recent opinion polls now show 76% of the public against only 14% in favour, making the air sell-off even more unpopular than fox-hunting. \"It's difficult to find even the most serial loyalist to approve of the plans, and I'm calling on the government to listen to its own supporters, not only on the backbenches but out in the country to pull back now before it is too late.\" Fellow Labour backbencher Gordon Prentice, MP for Pendle, said: \"The Nats proposals were not in Labour's manifesto and there is no compelling financial reason why we need to do this. \"The air traffic controllers don't want it and neither do the pilots. No country has privatised its air traffic control - not even the US. I want to see air traffic control remain firmly in public ownership.\" The Tory transport spokesman, Bernard Jenkin, said that Labour backbenchers had little reason to support the government's proposals. He said: \"Labour had no commitment in their manifesto to privatise Nats. On the contrary, they said 'our air is not for sale'.\" Most Labour MPs felt profoundly that \"this botched privatisation is wrong\", and the deputy prime minister John Prescott's handling of Railtrack did nothing to inspire confidence, Mr Jenkin added. The government plans to create a new company owning 46% of the shares in the National Air Traffic Service, with 5% of shares going to employees, while retaining 49% itself. Ministers will also retain a so-called \"golden share\", meaning a complete sell-off in the future could not go ahead without its approval. The Civil Aviation Authority would be the safety regulator for the Nats. Despite threats of a rebellion, the legislation is expected to pass comfortably through the Commons.

Today is a double celebration: the 21st anniversary of the Guardian's Society section and the launch of the website SocietyGuardian.co.uk</p> <p>A brief look back first. I launched the Society column in 1979 with a prediction that for the first time since the founding of the welfare state, it was no longer possible to predict that society was going to get better. Margaret Thatcher was in Downing Street and three separate spending squeezes were being planned.</p> <p>Society, as a whole, did get better. Average household spending has gone up by more than half. Spending on travel and communication has more than doubled while spending on recreation, entertainment and education almost trebled.</p> <p>Yet, as I note in today's printed Society section, the prediction was accurate for the poor. The number of children living in poverty tripled. No other developed state except New Zealand has experienced such a brutal reversal. When Labour came to power in 1997, one in three children were living in poverty (in households with below half average income).</p> <p>In the run-up to the last election, Tony Blair gave his party a crucial test: \"If the next Labour government has not raised the living standards of the poorest by the end of its time in office, it will have failed.\"</p> <p>It is now clear Labour will meet this target. After the worst of beginnings - sticking to Tory spending limits for two years, implementing the Tories' lone parent benefit cut, squeezing incapacity benefits - the government is now on the road to creating a fairer society.</p> <p>Labour is on course to lift about 1.2m children and 800,000 adults out of poverty by April 2002. All families will have gained (by almost \u00a3850 a year) but poor families will have gained the most (almost \u00a31,500).</p> <p>Better still, Tony Blair last year set Labour one of the biggest social challenges of the last 50 years: \"Our historic aim will be for ours to be the first generation to end child poverty. It is a 20-year mission.\" Gordon Brown has subsequently set a 10-year target: \"Halving child poverty by 2009.\"</p> <p>Society readers cover a wide range of services. The hardest hit in the last 21 years has been housing. Public spending has shrunk from 1.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) to 0.4%. It is not quite as grim as this suggests because over 1m council homes have been sold; significant investment in \"social\" housing is now made by housing associations; and a large contribution to housing comes through a social security stream: housing benefits. Even so, the squeeze remains serious.</p> <p>Basic housing conditions have improved. Those lacking basic amenities fell from 15% in the 1970s to 1% in 1991. Yet overcrowding increased for the poorest fifth after 1990. Satisfaction with housing conditions grew, but dissatisfaction with neighbourhoods rose.</p> <p>Education suffered the sharpest rise and falls in spending in this period. The rise and fall of pupil numbers made this picture even more complicated. But compared with health, education has fallen behind in the spending league.</p> <p>Health has had the healthiest injection of funds. Way back in 1973, it was only receiving 3.8% of GDP. It has now climbed to 6.8% and has been guaranteed a one third real terms increase over the next five years - the largest and most sustained increase since the NHS was set up in 1948. </p> <p>So what does the future hold? It will be make or break for the NHS. If it fails to provide a more responsive service, Labour has signalled it will look at other alternatives. They are bound to involve more extensive deals with the private sector. But the NHS plan has produced a new sense of optimism. All parts of the service were consulted. All the new ideas, set out in the plan, are already being applied somewhere in the system. They do work.</p> <p>Science and technology will remain powerful driving forces. About 90% of medicines in the early 1990s were unknown 30 years ago; 50% unknown six years ago. In the next three decades, all patients could have their genes profiled, stored in an NHS database, and used in computer diagnoses of sickness.</p> <p>Crime is the most difficult trend to predict. It has increased on average by 5% a year since 1918. But in the last six years it has dropped - this is true for recorded crime and the more accurate British crime survey. (Recorded crime is less accurate because only half of all crime is reported, and almost half reported crime is not recorded.) Officials at the Home Office are expecting next January's figures to show a further drop in recorded crime. But how long this will continue no one is prepared to predict.</p> <p>Part of the fall is clearly due to better prevention methods: more secure cars have drastically reduced the theft of vehicles and theft from them. More secure houses have caused a similar fall in burglaries.</p> <p>The rise in imprisonment has had relatively little impact: it needs a 26% increase to achieve a 1% fall in crime. Interestingly, the fall in crime is not confined to the UK. It is happening across Europe and in some parts of North America. The big test for Britain is whether the new priority given to violent crime will achieve a similar fall to the drop in property crime achieved by targeting.</p> <p>The welfare state abandoned the idea of a universal service many years ago. It still holds true in education and health, where private provision accounts for less than 10% of the state service. But in social security, both major parties are expecting the current ratio in pension provision (60% public to 40% private) to be reversed over the next 30 years.</p> <p>It is going to be particularly tough for younger people in this new world of fixed-term contract working. As the proportion of retired people continues to rise, so will the demand for a later retirement age to cover this cost. Stand by for a more open inter-generational war.</p>",

In the run-up to the last election, Tony Blair gave his party a crucial test: \"If the next Labour government has not raised the living standards of the poorest by the end of its time in office, it will have failed.\" It is now clear Labour will meet this target. After the worst of beginnings - sticking to Tory spending limits for two years, implementing the Tories' lone parent benefit cut, squeezing incapacity benefits - the government is now on the road to creating a fairer society. Labour is on course to lift about 1.2m children and 800,000 adults out of poverty by April 2002. All families will have gained (by almost \u00a3850 a year) but poor families will have gained the most (almost \u00a31,500). Better still, Tony Blair last year set Labour one of the biggest social challenges of the last 50 years: \"Our historic aim will be for ours to be the first generation to end child poverty. It is a 20-year mission.\" Gordon Brown has subsequently set a 10-year target: \"Halving child poverty by 2009.\" Society readers cover a wide range of services. The hardest hit in the last 21 years has been housing. Public spending has shrunk from 1.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) to 0.4%. It is not quite as grim as this suggests because over 1m council homes have been sold; significant investment in \"social\" housing is now made by housing associations; and a large contribution to housing comes through a social security stream: housing benefits. Even so, the squeeze remains serious. Basic housing conditions have improved. Those lacking basic amenities fell from 15% in the 1970s to 1% in 1991. Yet overcrowding increased for the poorest fifth after 1990. Satisfaction with housing conditions grew, but dissatisfaction with neighbourhoods rose. Education suffered the sharpest rise and falls in spending in this period. The rise and fall of pupil numbers made this picture even more complicated. But compared with health, education has fallen behind in the spending league. Health has had the healthiest injection of funds. Way back in 1973, it was only receiving 3.8% of GDP. It has now climbed to 6.8% and has been guaranteed a one third real terms increase over the next five years - the largest and most sustained increase since the NHS was set up in 1948. So what does the future hold? It will be make or break for the NHS. If it fails to provide a more responsive service, Labour has signalled it will look at other alternatives. They are bound to involve more extensive deals with the private sector. But the NHS plan has produced a new sense of optimism. All parts of the service were consulted. All the new ideas, set out in the plan, are already being applied somewhere in the system. They do work. Science and technology will remain powerful driving forces. About 90% of medicines in the early 1990s were unknown 30 years ago; 50% unknown six years ago. In the next three decades, all patients could have their genes profiled, stored in an NHS database, and used in computer diagnoses of sickness. Crime is the most difficult trend to predict. It has increased on average by 5% a year since 1918. But in the last six years it has dropped - this is true for recorded crime and the more accurate British crime survey. (Recorded crime is less accurate because only half of all crime is reported, and almost half reported crime is not recorded.) Officials at the Home Office are expecting next January's figures to show a further drop in recorded crime. But how long this will continue no one is prepared to predict. Part of the fall is clearly due to better prevention methods: more secure cars have drastically reduced the theft of vehicles and theft from them. More secure houses have caused a similar fall in burglaries. The rise in imprisonment has had relatively little impact: it needs a 26% increase to achieve a 1% fall in crime. Interestingly, the fall in crime is not confined to the UK. It is happening across Europe and in some parts of North America. The big test for Britain is whether the new priority given to violent crime will achieve a similar fall to the drop in property crime achieved by targeting. The welfare state abandoned the idea of a universal service many years ago. It still holds true in education and health, where private provision accounts for less than 10% of the state service. But in social security, both major parties are expecting the current ratio in pension provision (60% public to 40% private) to be reversed over the next 30 years. It is going to be particularly tough for younger people in this new world of fixed-term contract working. As the proportion of retired people continues to rise, so will the demand for a later retirement age to cover this cost. Stand by for a more open inter-generational war.",

      "body": "<p>As floods reached their highest levels for centuries, newspapers carried pictures of a flock of sheep huddled together in a farmhouse sitting room - yet more victims of the storm. </p> <p>But amusement and sympathy may be misplaced. Sheep are deeply implicated in the floods that have menaced British cities, from York to Shrewsbury, in the last few weeks. </p> <p>Ann Sansom, a rural land use officer in the north-east region, argues that we should take more notice of land use when looking at floods. She says: \"We've focused on the water, but it's not the river that generates floods. It's the land.\" </p> <p>She believes that a huge increase in sheep numbers has stopped the moors functioning as they always did - as giant sponges. In the 1860s, Britain's sheep population was about 8m. During the war, it was about 12m. Today, thanks to EU subsidies, there are more than 40m. </p> <p>Sansom and other ecologists say that the fragile uplands can't support more than 1.5 sheep per hectare. But some moors have seven and never get the chance to recover because animals remain there all year, trampling in the land and stripping back the vegetation. </p> <p>With vegetation stripped away and the land puddled, the water pours off the hills ever faster. Doubling a river's speed increases its erosive power fourfold and its power to carry sediment 64 times. As river beds are gouged deeper and deeper, lethal flash floods become common. Meanwhile, topsoil is washed into rivers, killing fish and wildlife, and reservoirs become choked. According to a report four years ago, sedimentation had reduced the capacity of Yorkshire Water's reservoirs by nearly 9,000m litres, or 7.5%. The company put the cost at \u00a374m. </p> <p>Overstocking of sheep also prevents water soaking into the ground. Research in the Pennines by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds showed that trampling by cloven feet had sealed the ground. The top three or four inches were soaking but, just below, the soil was dry. With water unable to percolate into the aquifers that are a crucial source of drinking water, they fail to recharge and floods are followed by drought. </p> <p>Sansom even warns of desertification on uplands stripped of fauna. \"Spain is suffering desertification, but it has extreme conditions,\" she says. \"We have a temperate maritime climate, so there is no excuse for things not growing here.\" </p> <p>The implications of Sansom's thinking extend beyond Britain's moors and beyond the swollen rivers, such as the Ouse and the Severn, that drain them. \"People must understand that if we alter a catchment upstream there'll be inevitable impacts downstream,\" she says. </p> <p>The US government, remembering the calamitous dustbowls of the 30s, has shut entire ranges to prevent overgrazing and the human and ecological disasters that follow. </p> <p>But even if policy-makers and flood victims do begin to take a hard look at the impact of new land-use practices, it risks being in vain. The environment agency can go on spending countless millions on flood defences, but over sheep regimes and new crop practices it remains powerless.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As floods reached their highest levels for centuries, newspapers carried pictures of a flock of sheep huddled together in a farmhouse sitting room - yet more victims of the storm. But amusement and sympathy may be misplaced. Sheep are deeply implicated in the floods that have menaced British cities, from York to Shrewsbury, in the last few weeks. Ann Sansom, a rural land use officer in the north-east region, argues that we should take more notice of land use when looking at floods. She says: \"We've focused on the water, but it's not the river that generates floods. It's the land.\" She believes that a huge increase in sheep numbers has stopped the moors functioning as they always did - as giant sponges. In the 1860s, Britain's sheep population was about 8m. During the war, it was about 12m. Today, thanks to EU subsidies, there are more than 40m. Sansom and other ecologists say that the fragile uplands can't support more than 1.5 sheep per hectare. But some moors have seven and never get the chance to recover because animals remain there all year, trampling in the land and stripping back the vegetation. With vegetation stripped away and the land puddled, the water pours off the hills ever faster. Doubling a river's speed increases its erosive power fourfold and its power to carry sediment 64 times. As river beds are gouged deeper and deeper, lethal flash floods become common. Meanwhile, topsoil is washed into rivers, killing fish and wildlife, and reservoirs become choked. According to a report four years ago, sedimentation had reduced the capacity of Yorkshire Water's reservoirs by nearly 9,000m litres, or 7.5%. The company put the cost at \u00a374m. Overstocking of sheep also prevents water soaking into the ground. Research in the Pennines by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds showed that trampling by cloven feet had sealed the ground. The top three or four inches were soaking but, just below, the soil was dry. With water unable to percolate into the aquifers that are a crucial source of drinking water, they fail to recharge and floods are followed by drought. Sansom even warns of desertification on uplands stripped of fauna. \"Spain is suffering desertification, but it has extreme conditions,\" she says. \"We have a temperate maritime climate, so there is no excuse for things not growing here.\" The implications of Sansom's thinking extend beyond Britain's moors and beyond the swollen rivers, such as the Ouse and the Severn, that drain them. \"People must understand that if we alter a catchment upstream there'll be inevitable impacts downstream,\" she says. The US government, remembering the calamitous dustbowls of the 30s, has shut entire ranges to prevent overgrazing and the human and ecological disasters that follow. But even if policy-makers and flood victims do begin to take a hard look at the impact of new land-use practices, it risks being in vain. The environment agency can go on spending countless millions on flood defences, but over sheep regimes and new crop practices it remains powerless.",

Insulting to the professionalism of the singers (whose diction is crystal clear) and to the erudition of the audience (who know the work intimately), they fumed. </p> <p>The peacocks of the press were quickly and rightly shamed on the letters pages, where readers pointed out the value of surtitles to patrons with hearing loss, and praised the opera house management for its policy of surtitling all its operas, including those written and sung in English. </p> <p>The critics' elitism has at least made a lot of people realise that many of the deaf, or those with impaired hearing, enjoy the performing arts, but feel excluded because many venues do little or nothing to enable them to understand what's going on. </p> <p>The comprehensive and frequently updated access guide for disabled people, published by the Society of London Theatre, lists 50 West End venues, most of which cater to some extent for those with hearing loss. However, 13 have no sound amplification system for patrons with hearing loss, and 20 never offer signed performances. Of those that do, it tends to be one or two performances a season. </p> <p>Most dispiriting to the hearing impaired is our general slowness in using computer technology, which has been around for decades. But now there is a ray of hope: it has been a long time coming, but it will be glimpsed tonight at the Barbican theatre in London when the Royal Shakespeare Company will provide an \"open captioned\" performance of Webster's The Duchess of Malfi. </p> <p>On one side of the proscenium arch, the text of the Jacobean tragedy will be scrolled, three lines at a time, on a large computer screen, synchronised with actors speaking the words. A batch of seats in the stalls has been reserved for deaf members of the audience; another group of patrons will be interested in their reaction. These are theatre and arts managers from the commercial and subsidised sectors, most of whom will be seeing open captioning for the first time. </p> <p>This may be hardly surprising, given that the equipment is not yet available in Britain. It is produced in the US and the fact that it is here at all is thanks to Peter Pullan, a frustrated but determined arts-lover who is partially deaf. He has spent \u00a310,000 of his own savings to buy the equipment and loan it to theatres. With two friends, Merfyn Williams and Geoff Brown, he founded a company, Stagetext, which has applied for charitable status, to demonstrate the usefulness of open captioning. </p> <p>Pullan, 53, who works full-time in industry, first saw open captioning at a theatre in New York. The oblong box, 1.4 me tres long (4ft 6ins), produces the text in letters 5cm (2ins) high and so transformed his enjoyment that he became obsessed with making it available here. He hopes that reaction to tonight's performance will prick the consciences of several theatre managements and open their chequebooks. \"There's an awful lack of awareness,\" he says. \"Managements say to us: 'Well, we don't get any complaints.' But that's because people with hearing loss hardly go to the theatre.\" </p> <p>Well-meaning though managements may be, the provision they presently make for deaf playgoers is not adequate, Pullan argues. \"There's a lot more to [accommodating] hearing loss than providing a loop or a signed performance. Many people have no idea that there are many different degrees and types of hearing problems.\" </p> <p>His own case illustrates this - and shows how people use a combination of techniques to cope. He has no hearing in his left ear and loses some of the higher frequencies in his right, wears a hearing aid and gets by with a combination of partial hearing, lip-reading and body language. Until he experienced open captioning, he had to do a lot of preparation to get the maximum out of a theatre visit. </p> <p>This meant reading the script, if available in advance; going only to plays he was familiar with; or, in the case of some musicals, watching a DVD version - again, if it was available. </p> <p>The ideal solution, Pullan says, would be for all theatres to buy their own equipment, or for companies owning several houses to buy one set for pooled use. The hope is that representatives of Lord Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Company, and Cameron Mackintosh's organisation, will go along to the RSC and be sufficiently impressed to invest in the system. The RSC itself is on the point of buying its own open captioning equipment, which it will use on tour, as well as for its seasons in Stratford-upon-Avon and London. </p> <p>It seems likely, though, that there will be a need for Stagetext for a long time yet. The group would like to see provincial theatres offering open captioning and its campaign is to be extended outside London. The Abbey National charitable trust has given it \u00a316,500 to reimburse Pullan for the equipment and pay for the training of operators, who need to have full hearing so they can synchronise text with spoken or sung libretto. </p> <p>Two years ago, Pullan tried to get the management of English National Opera to use surtitles for its operas, which are usually sung in English. It wouldn't do so, he says, because it feared it would be an admission that the words were unclear. But now the position has changed, at least a little. </p> <p>A few weeks ago, Pullan was at the surtitled Billy Budd, along with the critics. His verdict: \"It was sensational. I've never been to an opera in English before where I've understood every word. If we see the words just before they're sung, it enables us to hear it better. But we were terrified afterwards that the opera house would get cold feet because of what the critics said about it.\" </p> <p>On the contrary, it was bouquets for the opera house, boos for the critics. </p> <p>\u0095 Things are \"improving quite considerably\" for disabled people wishing to go to the theatre in London's west end, according to Brian Vickers, access officer with information and enabling charity Artsline. </p> <p>No longer is it merely a question of ramps for wheelchairs and accessible toilets. \"At the Palladium, and at any Really Useful Company venue, there is a member of staff to look after the needs of disabled people,\" says Vickers. \"They will even bring a drink to you at the interval.\" </p> <p>As well as aids for people with limited hearing, theatres may now offer \"audio described\" performances for patrons with limited sight. </p> <p>Latest information on all facilities can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.theatre-access.co.uk,\">www.theatre-access.co.uk</a>, a website run by the Society of London Theatre. </p> <p>Vickers cautions, though, that parking remains a considerable obstacle. As he says: \"The big problem for west end theatres is that they are in the west end.\"</p>",

No longer is it merely a question of ramps for wheelchairs and accessible toilets. \"At the Palladium, and at any Really Useful Company venue, there is a member of staff to look after the needs of disabled people,\" says Vickers. \"They will even bring a drink to you at the interval.\" As well as aids for people with limited hearing, theatres may now offer \"audio described\" performances for patrons with limited sight. Latest information on all facilities can be found at: www.theatre-access.co.uk, a website run by the Society of London Theatre. Vickers cautions, though, that parking remains a considerable obstacle. As he says: \"The big problem for west end theatres is that they are in the west end.\"",

      "body": "<p>When Olympic rower Steve Redgrave recently announced his retirement, he also ruled out coaching. The point was to give up the gruelling schedule, he said, not put in more hours. </p> <p>Ex-footballer Howard Gayle knows all about coaching commitments. He runs Stanley House Youth Academy in the Toxteth area of Liverpool, where he grew up and still lives. He trains with his young teams five nights a week, unpaid, in all weathers. \"The hours are much longer than playing,\" he says. \"When I'm not coaching, I'm planning trips, preparing training schedules, organising fundraising events, or advising players and parents.\" </p> <p>Gayle, 43, played for Liverpool between 1977 and 1982, at a time when the team were top in Europe as well as in England, but long before professional footballers were celebrities with stratospheric salaries and egos to match. \"There were better players than me who weren't getting the opportunities they should have,\" he says modestly. He was also the club's first black player and suffered the racism endemic in the sport at the time. </p> <p>But it wasn't only the racism he noticed. Over the years, he saw talented young players plucked from obscurity to play in top clubs' youth teams, only to be dumped unceremoniously back in their communities if they failed to make the grade. Having been role models to their friends and families, they were often unable to handle what they perceived to be failure - with the community bearing the brunt if they went off the rails. When he retired in 1993, Gayle realised he could help the many talented youngsters he saw in his area, equipping them with the mental - as well as physical - skills needed to deal with this fickle sport. </p> <p>\"You have to be mentally hardened,\" Gayle says. \"People only see the end product and not the hard work that's gone on during the week, the stuff you have to sacrifice, the disappointments of failures and injuries.\" </p> <p>And it's becoming increasingly hard for a young English player to break into a premier league club. The big clubs cherry-pick the talent from youth teams and Sunday leagues, he says, raising hopes but not taking any responsibility for dashed dreams. </p> <p>\"Only a tiny percentage of boys will be picked to train on the club's YTS or football scholarship schemes, and success has to be immediate.\" A boy could then be playing for Liverpool's youth team for years, he points out, but if the club decides to spend \u00a315m on a foreigner who plays in his position, the chances of getting into the first team are minimal. But while it must be nearly impossible to persuade a young player not to join Liverpool or Everton if invited, Gayle says he has convinced some to opt for another path. \"I think players from inner-city areas like Toxteth can be better off going to smaller clubs and working their way up the ladder rather than going to the big clubs and being released. There isn't the support mechanism to get them back on track. They feel playing for teams like ours is beneath them after they've been at premiership clubs and a lot give up football altogether.\" </p> <p>One of his former players, 16-year-old Leslie Afful, is now on a YTS scheme at third division Exeter City. Both Liverpool and Everton approached him, but he opted for Exeter - a lot less glamorous and a long way from home. \"I thought I'd have a better chance of getting first team games in,\" says Afful, who is happy and settled in Exeter. \"I never thought of football as a career, but playing at Stanley House gave me a passion for it.\" His foster mum has been to see him, he says, and he gets a lot of support from the club. </p> <p>Mike Radford, youth development officer at Exeter, is delighted with Afful's progress. \"He's a great ambassador for the club and he's doing brilliantly on the pitch as well,\" he says. \"We only have 14 trainees and we only take them on if we genuinely believe they have a chance. They study for GNVQs and it isn't the end of the world if they don't make it to professional level, as many go into related careers such as sports science or media. In Leslie's case we saw him play and invited him back. In terms of personality I have to go on what Howard tells me, but I trust him implicitly and what he told me was spot on. We are immensely pleased with Leslie here.\" </p> <p>In the US, sport has long been used as a tool to give youngsters opportunities, but also a sense of social responsibility. Gayle wants to see more of this thinking here, as well as finance applied at the grassroots level in inner-city areas. He has no official funding and, in fact, has to pay for the use of the council-owned sports centre where his teams train. </p> <p>\"Football at this level has been suffering for years,\" he says. \"Managers of clubs like ours are running them on a shoestring, sometimes out of their own pocket, then gaps are left when the clubs take our best players.\" He wants the big clubs to acknowledge the talent they are acquiring with either a statutory fee or payment in kind such as new kit or balls for training. </p> <p>Convinced of the benefits to the youngsters themselves and the wider community that Stanley House and other youth teams provide, Gayle's main concern is to see them achieving goals on and off the pitch. \"What they learn extends beyond football. There's no point in them coming here and playing brilliantly and then going away and acting anti-socially. It's not a boot camp, but in a lot of cases it's the only discipline they have. This feeds back into their schoolwork and their behaviour.\" </p> <p>Gayle is a modest man, and keen to protect his players - black and white - from the stigma so often attached to Toxteth, both within Liverpool and the country at large. \"People think we are rough, but we're not. Kids who join us from other areas are amazed at how quickly they are accepted.\" </p> <p>It is almost a rhetorical question to ask him what he gets out of it. \"Being with young people,\" he replies without hesitation. \"Seeing their faces when they achieve something. Watching them develop, watching them see themselves develop. It's not all a steady progression; we are trying to make them understand they have to be responsible.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Charity is surely one area of our lives where attitudes can still be resolutely Dickensian. It came as a shock to me when, at the age of 35, I had to become dependent on charity for the first time in my life. I had been an independent career woman, a teacher - one of the givers, rather than the receivers. And probably rather complacent, too. </p> <p>People with disabilities get a certain amount from the government in the form of benefits and grants, but the rest must come from charity. My son, Alex, was born 10 years ago with cerebral palsy and, as a single parent having (and wanting) to stay at home to care for him, I have, like many others, had to work very hard at developing skills of persuasion and persistence. </p> <p>At the moment, I am trying to raise \u00a32,500 for a hands-free walking frame. I have written to 50 local companies with a smiley photo of my son and a plea for help. Fundraising for others is one thing; doing it for your own child is quite another. Choosing possible suitable companies. Phoning for names. Waiting for results. So far we've managed \u00a325, which at least covers the postage and photocopying costs. People don't like giving to individuals rather than established charities, so you can easily feel like a fraud. I find the whole process demoralising - and downright embarrassing. </p> <p>There are, of course, charities full of saintly people who will do it all for you. One well-known charity used to have a system where parents had to phone on the first Monday of each month until somebody answered the phone to put your name on the waiting list - the waiting list, that is, for an application form to be put on the real waiting list. I phoned determinedly for four months, phone stuck between my cheek and shoulder for hours on end, only to be told when I did get through: \"I'm afraid we're not taking any more names now - could you try again next year?\" The charity has since changed its system, in response to a plethora of complaints from infuriated parents. </p> <p>The average waiting list for that kind of money from any charity is about a year. My son needs his walker now, owing to problems with threatening hip dislocation. Hence the do-it-myself attempt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, another charity, \"bringing gifts of happiness and hope\", offered us a free, three-day break - not to Disneyland, Florida, as advertised in its leaflet to donors, but to anywhere in Britain, preferably Butlins or Center Parcs. As those weren't our kind of holiday, I asked if we could go to London instead. This threw up new problems. It takes two to get powerchair and ramps in and out of car, child in and out of bath, or up and down steps, but the charity wouldn't pay for my partner, who was the only person who offered to help - and he was understandably reluctant to pay \u00a365 a night for the suggested hotel in addition to taking three days off work. </p> <p>\"It would be different if he was your son's father, of course,\" I was told. \"We do pay for families.\" </p> <p>The only other stumbling block was that I was to provide proof of cerebral palsy and a letter to say that the carer would be suitable. \"But I'm not taking a carer,\" I said, \"I'm going with him myself!\" </p> <p>\"Oh well, in that case,\" the charity lady said sanctimoniously, \"you will need a letter to say that you are a suitable person to accompany your son on holiday.\" I can't remember what I said, but I think I may have looked that gift horse in the mouth. </p> <p>Another charitable approach is to \"match\" money raised by other means. Hence, one charity was pleased to give me \u00a3100 towards a computer joystick so long as I managed to find the rest from a different source. I naively thought this might be a sharing of the \"burden\" - but not so. It was apparently to make me \"feel better\" as I would have done more of the work myself. As if I have no other work to do - caring, after all, is not counted as a job. </p> <p>Nobody likes being dependent on charity. There are certainly grants available for certain things from charities, such as the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which try to cover the gaps left by health and social services. And yet at every stage of Alex's childhood, as with other families with disabled children, we have had huge expenses which can be met only by fundraising. </p> <p>First, at age two, there were courses in conductive education (a specialised form of physiotherapy) at the Peto Institute. At three, a special supportive trike (provided by our local residents' association) cost \u00a3500. Then another at six when he outgrew that, and another at eight, provided by the local pub. </p> <p>We need special, very expensive toys designed for uncoordinated hands, and hardback books which stay open better when he turns the pages to read (he cannot hold them down himself). Dribbling and food spillages mean constant changes of clothes, and special Pedro boots are \u00a3100 a pair if your health authority won't pay, as some won't. Car seats for older children who need extra support come in at \u00a3600. Wheelchairs, home adaptations and so on are provided, just as long as you don't want anything different from standard NHS issue. The list really is endless. And combine all this with the limited earning capacity of parents who must also be carers - doing the lifting, feeding, washing, dressing, teaching, helping, worrying and ferrying to and fro from endless appointments. </p> <p> Here, however, is a true \"fairy godmother\" story. The local pharmacist's wife suggested when Alex was four that we wrote to the director of a large local IT company for a computer. Sceptical as to my probable success, I put off writing. But every time I went into the shop she kept nagging me: \"Have you written that letter yet?\" So in the end, just to keep her happy, I did. \"Dear Sir,\" I wrote, somewhat tongue in cheek, \"please can I have a computer for my son who has cerebral palsy. He needs a PC with Pentium, min 16MB memory, CD-Rom and soundcard.\" There, I told her, I've done it. </p> <p>Four weeks of silence later, the director himself arrived slightly out of breath at my front door bearing a very large cardboard box. I was flabbergasted. But the best thing is, not only did we get exactly what I'd asked for - no questions asked, no smiley photos or simpering thank-you letters required - but that ever since, we have been given free servicing and maintenance, an annual grant for software, and last week the offer of a new PC to replace the old one which \"must be on its last legs\". </p> <p>The said director has been awarded an OBE for his services to education and the community.

Many youngsters, the organisers claim, would not otherwise get an evening meal. </p> <p>The objections included a claim that bad language was affecting other children playing in neighbouring gardens, and a contention that the centre had \"altered the character of a conservation area\".

He says: \"The council has a responsibility to the residents of Southwark, who include those people from poor homes and backgrounds who need looking after. </p> <p>\"People need to know about the remarkable work that goes on at the centre. It takes potential criminals off the street and into an environment that is sympathetic. They are remarkably law-abiding and well behaved when they are there. They belong in the community. They are part of it. We need to consider whether it is right that these children should be pushed back out on to the street and ghettoised.\" </p> <p>Michael Jackson, Channel 4's chief executive and also a Kids Company trustee, says he has made many visits to the centre and never noticed a problem with noise levels. \"In a post-70s world where the state doesn't feel it can do everything any more, here is a very idealistic but equally practical solution that is proven to be working. It is really depressing that a local council, where Labour is the largest party, does not see this as a fantastic asset. It is a really successful alternative to the big expensive centralised route to tackling these problems.\" </p> <p>But local ward councillor David Noakes, a Liberal Democrat, defends his constituents' objections. \"As far as I can see, while they are in Kids Company the children are well behaved,\" he says. \"But I cannot be 100% sure that, when it closes each night, they disperse to their homes. </p> <p>\"I knocked on the doors of the 40 closest properties and found that 60% were against the centre. Some of the residents were saying they could not continue to live in the area because of the centre. I am sure there may be one or two people who are not lobbying for all the right reasons, but there are a lot of people who are.\" </p> <p>Stephen Lancashire, Labour councillor in charge of regeneration in Southwark, says: \"This was a retrospective application which we had to deal with purely on planning grounds. We thought long and hard about the decision, but in the end the centre did not meet with strict planning guidelines. </p> <p>\"Because we felt so strongly about this specific situation, instead of giving Kids Company 28 days to move out, they have until June. In the meantime, we have instructed officers to help look for a more suitable site.\"</p>",

We need to consider whether it is right that these children should be pushed back out on to the street and ghettoised.\" Michael Jackson, Channel 4's chief executive and also a Kids Company trustee, says he has made many visits to the centre and never noticed a problem with noise levels. \"In a post-70s world where the state doesn't feel it can do everything any more, here is a very idealistic but equally practical solution that is proven to be working. It is really depressing that a local council, where Labour is the largest party, does not see this as a fantastic asset. It is a really successful alternative to the big expensive centralised route to tackling these problems.\" But local ward councillor David Noakes, a Liberal Democrat, defends his constituents' objections. \"As far as I can see, while they are in Kids Company the children are well behaved,\" he says. \"But I cannot be 100% sure that, when it closes each night, they disperse to their homes. \"I knocked on the doors of the 40 closest properties and found that 60% were against the centre. Some of the residents were saying they could not continue to live in the area because of the centre. I am sure there may be one or two people who are not lobbying for all the right reasons, but there are a lot of people who are.\" Stephen Lancashire, Labour councillor in charge of regeneration in Southwark, says: \"This was a retrospective application which we had to deal with purely on planning grounds. We thought long and hard about the decision, but in the end the centre did not meet with strict planning guidelines. \"Because we felt so strongly about this specific situation, instead of giving Kids Company 28 days to move out, they have until June. In the meantime, we have instructed officers to help look for a more suitable site.\"",

      "trailText": "<p>The answers to the main questions</p>",
      "byline": "James Meek",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>What is a patent?</strong><br> A patent is a kind of licence granted by a government to an inventor. It gives the inventor the right, through the courts, to stop rivals from making, using or selling an invention without his or her permission. When a patent is granted, the invention becomes the property of the inventor. However the patent can be bought, sold, rented or hired. </p> <p> <strong>How long does a patent last? </strong><br> Normally 20 years. After that, anyone can use the invention without restrictions. </p> <p> <strong>Who issues patents?</strong><br> In Britain, the UK Patent Office. But Britain is a signatory to the European Patent Convention, so inventions patented in one of 19 other European countries can have patent protection here too through the European Patent Office. Under the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, which came into force in 1995, almost the entire world is supposed to have acquired similar patent rules. </p> <p> <strong>What are the criteria for granting a patent to an inventor? </strong><br> An invention must be novel - no-one else can have made it public; innovative - it can't be a development which would be obvious to specialists in the relevant field; and useful - it has to aid a practical human activity. It cannot be simply a discovery. </p> <p> <strong>But surely genes are pure discoveries?</strong><br> So opponents of gene patenting argue. They also point out that with modern automated gene analysis techniques, the non-obviousness of genes is becoming doubtful. Supporters of gene patenting say gene function is not obvious and that genes are not mere discoveries because the genes are patented together with inventive descriptions of how they can be used for diagnosis or therapy. </p> <p> <strong>So what living things can be patented? </strong><br> Naturally-occurring life forms, from plankton to people, cannot. But genetically engineered plants and animals, such as GM maize or lab mice designed to be prone to cancer, can. So can the naturally-occurring chemical codes and substances which allow all plants and animals, including humans, to function on a cellular level - like genes, or hormones - as long as the 'inventor' can specify a use for them.</p> <p> <strong>Why should anyone want to patent something which occurs in nature? </strong><br> Holding a patent on a human, plant or animal gene gives the holder control over commercial exploitation of that gene.

      "bodyText": "What is a patent? A patent is a kind of licence granted by a government to an inventor. It gives the inventor the right, through the courts, to stop rivals from making, using or selling an invention without his or her permission. When a patent is granted, the invention becomes the property of the inventor. However the patent can be bought, sold, rented or hired. How long does a patent last? Normally 20 years. After that, anyone can use the invention without restrictions. Who issues patents? In Britain, the UK Patent Office. But Britain is a signatory to the European Patent Convention, so inventions patented in one of 19 other European countries can have patent protection here too through the European Patent Office. Under the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, which came into force in 1995, almost the entire world is supposed to have acquired similar patent rules. What are the criteria for granting a patent to an inventor? An invention must be novel - no-one else can have made it public; innovative - it can't be a development which would be obvious to specialists in the relevant field; and useful - it has to aid a practical human activity. It cannot be simply a discovery. But surely genes are pure discoveries? So opponents of gene patenting argue. They also point out that with modern automated gene analysis techniques, the non-obviousness of genes is becoming doubtful. Supporters of gene patenting say gene function is not obvious and that genes are not mere discoveries because the genes are patented together with inventive descriptions of how they can be used for diagnosis or therapy. So what living things can be patented? Naturally-occurring life forms, from plankton to people, cannot. But genetically engineered plants and animals, such as GM maize or lab mice designed to be prone to cancer, can. So can the naturally-occurring chemical codes and substances which allow all plants and animals, including humans, to function on a cellular level - like genes, or hormones - as long as the 'inventor' can specify a use for them. Why should anyone want to patent something which occurs in nature? Holding a patent on a human, plant or animal gene gives the holder control over commercial exploitation of that gene. If it's a human gene, that may involve diagnosis or therapy for a disease; if plant or animal, it may also involve disease, the promotion of a desirable characteristic like a sweet taste, or the transfer of the gene from one organism to another. If someone has patented something which occurs naturally in my body, do I have to pay them? No. Confusingly, a naturally-occurring gene can be patented as an isolated sequence, but not a gene in its natural state. Can someone use a patent to block research? Yes and no. One of the claimed advantages of the patent system is that it obliges the inventor to publish details of his or her invention, allowing academic scientists to study it. But as soon as a researcher tries to make commercial use of developments based on the original patent - by going into partnership with a drugs firm, for instance, or charging patients at cost for a genetic test - the patent holder can step in to stop them, or oblige them to pay a licence fee. How important are patents for innovative companies? Traditionally very important, as inventor James Dyson's recent victory over Hoover in the bagless vacuum cleaner wars showed. Many biotech companies, big and small, argue that genes must be patentable to allow firms to recoup their investment in identifying them. But other firms fear allowing genes to be patented before any specific, proven use has been established for them will hold back medical advances. Can governments override patents? Yes, if they feel it is vital for the public good, and the patent holder is being too restrictive. What would be the impact on the economy if gene patenting was banned? Unknown. The majority within the biotech lobby argues that it would discourage investment in genetic research. Yet the cost of identifying the function of a gene is a fraction of the cost of turning that gene into something useful, like a drug. There is an argument that the pharmaceutical industry, which has to come up with the bulk of the money anyway, would do better if firms were able to work freely with any genes and focused on patenting drugs instead.

About three-quarters of local authorities in England and Wales answered the association's questionnaire on relationships with the NHS. Only 1% said they were poor and 16% said average. That left 63% saying partnership with the health service was good and 21% saying it was excellent. </p> <p>Nearly nine out of 10 authorities said their relationship with the health sector had improved over the past three years and 71% said they already had joint arrangements for providing or commissioning services in their area. </p> <p>The figures are important because good cooperation between health and social services will be the key factor in avoiding a crisis in hospitals' acute wards during the winter. The system relies on local authority staff working to reduce the need for hospital admissions and to facilitate discharge to avoid unnecessary bed blocking. </p> <p>The LGA takes the view that winter pressures can best be avoided by continuing year-round cooperation with the NHS. \"Focusing resource allocation and planning upon a particular point of time - winter - diverts it away from vital work that will alleviate the problem in the long term,\" a spokesman says. </p> <p>The survey showed nearly half (43%) of authorities were considering pooling social services and NHS budgets, while 33% were thinking of allowing one partner to take the lead in commissioning particular services. A quarter said they were not looking into any of these options. </p> <p>The LGA remains concerned, however, that a \u00a3630m fund for tackling winter pressures is being channelled through the NHS with little transparency about how far resources are flowing through to social services departments. </p> <p>\"There is a danger that the NHS may begin to spot purchase at higher rates than local authorities are able to pay, destabilising the market and resulting in higher costs across the system,\" the LGA says.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A survey published today by the Local Government Association seeks to explode the perception that councils are resisting the drive by ministers to create a better partnership between the centrally-administered NHS and locally-run social services. Despite recent allegations that Tory-led authorities are engineering a crisis in relations to strike a blow at Labour's health reforms, the figures suggest a good measure of harmony and progress. About three-quarters of local authorities in England and Wales answered the association's questionnaire on relationships with the NHS. Only 1% said they were poor and 16% said average. That left 63% saying partnership with the health service was good and 21% saying it was excellent. Nearly nine out of 10 authorities said their relationship with the health sector had improved over the past three years and 71% said they already had joint arrangements for providing or commissioning services in their area. The figures are important because good cooperation between health and social services will be the key factor in avoiding a crisis in hospitals' acute wards during the winter. The system relies on local authority staff working to reduce the need for hospital admissions and to facilitate discharge to avoid unnecessary bed blocking. The LGA takes the view that winter pressures can best be avoided by continuing year-round cooperation with the NHS. \"Focusing resource allocation and planning upon a particular point of time - winter - diverts it away from vital work that will alleviate the problem in the long term,\" a spokesman says. The survey showed nearly half (43%) of authorities were considering pooling social services and NHS budgets, while 33% were thinking of allowing one partner to take the lead in commissioning particular services. A quarter said they were not looking into any of these options. The LGA remains concerned, however, that a \u00a3630m fund for tackling winter pressures is being channelled through the NHS with little transparency about how far resources are flowing through to social services departments. \"There is a danger that the NHS may begin to spot purchase at higher rates than local authorities are able to pay, destabilising the market and resulting in higher costs across the system,\" the LGA says.",

Since 1995, the crime rate on the estate has halved, with 87% of those in the community now saying they feel safe.

A comparison with 132 other wards in the south-west showed that Penwerris had the highest number of poor households, the highest proportion of children in households with no wage-earners and the second-highest number of lone parents. More than 50% of homes lacked central heating. Cold, damp homes meant childhood asthma, and other respiratory-related problems were commonplace. </p> <p>\"The estate was sinking into ghetto status,\" recalls Hazel Stutely, one of the health visitors. \"The place was a virtual no-go area for the police. Social services cutbacks meant there was no hands-on help for people.

Subsequently, the Beacon Community Regeneration Partnership was set up - a multi-agency group, led by the tenants. </p> <p>The results are now there for all to see. The low-rise blocks on Old Hill are now painted in vibrant colours, all chosen by the tenants who want to re-name it Rainbow Hill. The grim terraces are no longer grey, but have been transformed by bright cladding. Recladding and energy conservation measures have been carried out on 900 properties and 300 homes now have central heating. Increased security street lighting has dramatically reduced vandalism.

      "byline": "Patrick Weir",

      "body": "<p>You might think they'd be feeling pretty pleased with themselves at the social services headquarters of Derby and Derbyshire councils. After all, the two authorities have been identified as two of the three best in England in the government's latest social care performance indicators. But officials - and elected members - at the two councils are conspicuously reluctant to gloat. While quietly satisfied with their results, they are only too well aware of the limitations of the indicators as evidence of good practice - and of their sometimes double-edged nature. </p> <p>\"These results are obviously very gratifying, but the concept of doing well in social services is complex,\" says Margaret McGlade, Derby's director of social services. \"For instance, staff can be satisfied that they are doing their best in particular circumstances, which is more important to them than having their efforts measured by an indicator. An appreciation of the broader picture is essential, because individual indicators only measure one particular thing on a particular day.\" </p> <p>The Department of Health's second annual performance assessment framework findings, published last month, measured all 150 English social services departments against 37 indicators. Both Derby and Derbyshire were found to provide services of an \"acceptable,\" \"good\" or \"very good\" quality on 30 of the 37 measures. The only other authority to do so was Redbridge, east London. </p> <p>Derby was deemed to require urgent investigation of services in two areas: the timing of child protection reviews, and provision of statements of needs for elderly and disabled people and those with learning difficulties. Changes have already been made. </p> <p>\"We identified these areas last year,\" McGlade says. \"But it takes time to turn things around, and some services are harder to change than others. What must also be taken into account is the problem of staff recruitment, both locally and nationally. The budget for social care is under pressure everywhere, and insufficient numbers are being trained.\" </p> <p>Bruce Buckley, director of social services for Derbyshire, believes that, generally, league tables are \"pleasing for staff, as they can highlight the good work that is done, work which is often hidden and doesn't receive the recognition it deserves\". But, he adds: \"They can't tell the whole story.\" </p> <p>A case in point is the issue of fostering children in care under age 10. An authority can score highly if a certain number are successfully fostered; or that figure can be judged too high - some children perhaps having been fostered when they might have been adopted - and the authority's practices will be viewed less favourably. </p> <p>The education of children in care - considered in need of major improvement in both authorities, as across the country - can be equally problematic when it comes to measuring performance. \"Monitoring a child's progress is difficult,\" says Buckley. \"In some cases, the fact that exams are actually being considered, and then taken, is suc cess in itself. But the stability of the child in care will influence this.\" </p> <p>Karl Reid, who chairs the social services stewards' committee of Unison, the public services union, views performance indicators as evidence of a prevailing league table culture, which is not always necessarily helpful. \"As a school governor,\" he says, \"I am aware of the pressure they can bring to bear on people. Perspective can be lost when too much attention is paid to apparent under-achievement. Indicators would tell us more if they were used in the right context.\" </p> <p>Distortion may also arise when comparing the performance of one authority with that of another - which league tables inevitably invite. Reid says: \"Assessing the success or otherwise of an authority in a deprived area requires different criteria to be applied.\" </p> <p>More straightforward is the significant improvement over the last year in Derbyshire's care for the elderly service, which has enabled more people to live independently at home. And the reason is simple. </p> <p>\"The increase in government funding has made a big difference,\" says Andrew Milroy, community social services manager for north-east Derbyshire. \"This has meant greater stability and allowed us to work more efficiently with local NHS trusts. Because of the change in attitude and policy, primary health care has improved, as has recognition of our value to the elderly. More people are living longer, and now we can plan the development of our services with more confidence.\" </p> <p>As executive member with responsibility for social care and health on Derby council, Lonny Wilsoncroft says the results of all performance indicators \"should be explored in more detail, in order to see what we can learn from them\". It is a view echoed by Buckley. \"They are a step in the right direction,\" he says, \"and, as such, a guide which we can use to ask questions of ourselves.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "You might think they'd be feeling pretty pleased with themselves at the social services headquarters of Derby and Derbyshire councils. After all, the two authorities have been identified as two of the three best in England in the government's latest social care performance indicators. But officials - and elected members - at the two councils are conspicuously reluctant to gloat. While quietly satisfied with their results, they are only too well aware of the limitations of the indicators as evidence of good practice - and of their sometimes double-edged nature. \"These results are obviously very gratifying, but the concept of doing well in social services is complex,\" says Margaret McGlade, Derby's director of social services. \"For instance, staff can be satisfied that they are doing their best in particular circumstances, which is more important to them than having their efforts measured by an indicator. An appreciation of the broader picture is essential, because individual indicators only measure one particular thing on a particular day.\" The Department of Health's second annual performance assessment framework findings, published last month, measured all 150 English social services departments against 37 indicators. Both Derby and Derbyshire were found to provide services of an \"acceptable,\" \"good\" or \"very good\" quality on 30 of the 37 measures. The only other authority to do so was Redbridge, east London. Derby was deemed to require urgent investigation of services in two areas: the timing of child protection reviews, and provision of statements of needs for elderly and disabled people and those with learning difficulties. Changes have already been made. \"We identified these areas last year,\" McGlade says. \"But it takes time to turn things around, and some services are harder to change than others. What must also be taken into account is the problem of staff recruitment, both locally and nationally. The budget for social care is under pressure everywhere, and insufficient numbers are being trained.\" Bruce Buckley, director of social services for Derbyshire, believes that, generally, league tables are \"pleasing for staff, as they can highlight the good work that is done, work which is often hidden and doesn't receive the recognition it deserves\". But, he adds: \"They can't tell the whole story.\" A case in point is the issue of fostering children in care under age 10. An authority can score highly if a certain number are successfully fostered; or that figure can be judged too high - some children perhaps having been fostered when they might have been adopted - and the authority's practices will be viewed less favourably. The education of children in care - considered in need of major improvement in both authorities, as across the country - can be equally problematic when it comes to measuring performance. \"Monitoring a child's progress is difficult,\" says Buckley. \"In some cases, the fact that exams are actually being considered, and then taken, is suc cess in itself. But the stability of the child in care will influence this.\" Karl Reid, who chairs the social services stewards' committee of Unison, the public services union, views performance indicators as evidence of a prevailing league table culture, which is not always necessarily helpful. \"As a school governor,\" he says, \"I am aware of the pressure they can bring to bear on people. Perspective can be lost when too much attention is paid to apparent under-achievement. Indicators would tell us more if they were used in the right context.\" Distortion may also arise when comparing the performance of one authority with that of another - which league tables inevitably invite. Reid says: \"Assessing the success or otherwise of an authority in a deprived area requires different criteria to be applied.\" More straightforward is the significant improvement over the last year in Derbyshire's care for the elderly service, which has enabled more people to live independently at home. And the reason is simple. \"The increase in government funding has made a big difference,\" says Andrew Milroy, community social services manager for north-east Derbyshire. \"This has meant greater stability and allowed us to work more efficiently with local NHS trusts. Because of the change in attitude and policy, primary health care has improved, as has recognition of our value to the elderly. More people are living longer, and now we can plan the development of our services with more confidence.\" As executive member with responsibility for social care and health on Derby council, Lonny Wilsoncroft says the results of all performance indicators \"should be explored in more detail, in order to see what we can learn from them\". It is a view echoed by Buckley. \"They are a step in the right direction,\" he says, \"and, as such, a guide which we can use to ask questions of ourselves.\"",

Only when the mafia feels threatened - a crackdown by the state, the squeezing of profits - does it tend to hit the headlines, lashing out in defence of its interests.

Ottaviano Del Turco, the finance minister, asked the Bank of Italy to tighten controls. \"It is a known fact that it doesn't take more than an identification card and 20 minutes to transfer huge sums of cash from a small Italian city to banks in south east Asia, for example.\" Milan chief prosecutor Gerardo d'Ambrosio was ambivalent about the retailers' claims. \"I haven't had a single complaint since I took up my post here - these businessmen talk a lot at conferences but not to the Prosecutor's Office.\" Are they exaggerating to gain sympathy?

Diann Martin, a community nurse at the University of Chicago, says that discharge within 24 hours of serious surgery is now routine, with home care taking the place of hospital. \"We're doing things at home that five years ago were done in intensive care,\" Martin told a recent conference in London.</p> <p>What makes this possible is the emerging technology of \"telecare\". In Chicago, wound-care specialists monitor patients' progress over the internet. An electronic device in their home collects data such as blood-pressure and respiratory rate and takes regular snapshots of the wound. If all goes well, the rest of the patient's care can be done during a daily visit by a community nurse.</p> <p>Home care is the fastest growing sector of America's trillion dollar health industry. It's easy to see why: a day in hospital intensive care costs an insurance company $2,500, says Martin, but a visit by a district nurse is $100, and a routine \"teleconsultation\" is $35.</p> <p>Telecare is also coming - somewhat patchily - to the NHS. Since summer last year, the North Manchester primary care group has cut average waiting time for a dermatology appointment from 18 months to 17 days with teleconsultations. Nurses working for a specialist contractor visit GP surgeries, photograph patients' skin ailments with a digital camera and store electronic images on their laptops for downloading to specialist dermatologists who can decide which patients need further treatment. It may not be comparable to what is happening in the US, but it is a start.</p> <p>Providing targeted medical advice over the internet is about the highest level yet of what the government calls the electronic delivery of public services. Tony Blair has committed the government to delivering 100% of government services electronically by 2005 - two years later than the target in the US.</p> <p>At one level, the British target is patently absurd. Whatever advances take place in computer technology between now and 2005, it will not be possible to deliver meals on wheels down the internet. But because it is a prime ministerial target, it has to be met. The Cabinet Office has even counted how many individual government services there are (457 of them) and is ticking off those that are delivered electronically. The suspiciously precise figure so far is one-third.</p> <p>The snag is that the further you go from the Cabinet Office and the closer to the front line of delivering public services, the less confident people are about delivering services electronically. A survey by Mori for BT found that, in central government, more than 77% of officials were confident they would reach the 2005 target. In health and local government, however, barely more than a quarter were confident - and most were not.</p> <p>Malcolm Wylie, head of IT at Cambridge city council, says the picture is more subtle. \"Technically, if we just set out to put the tick in the box, we could do it within a year. But to get the real benefits is much more difficult. The jury's still out.\"</p> <p>But on the front line of care, IT is beginning to make a difference. The key is where it allows the joining up of services. One example is Suffolk social services, which has developed an electronic customer record on computer, allowing care professionals to call up a complete history of their clients.</p> <p>Joan Miller, Suffolk's head of information management, says that, as with the telecare example, the technology can cut demand for hospital beds. \"In the case of a request for an older person needing help, the system would say if they already have a home care service.

Persuading staff to change from pen to keyboard \"has taken a long time\", Miller admits. And that's only the beginning of the process, as care workers need to change the whole way they work. Computers force care workers to enter records consistently and in a structured form - a good thing for generating management information, but a new skill that has to be learned.</p> <p>And in some cases, a computer is out of place. Miller says: \"A social worker's job is talking to people.

For health and social care, the next challenge is to join up health records - currently held by GPs - with social care records, held by local authorities.

The latest to go off the rails is the probation service's \u00a3100m case recording system, which is being abandoned after only 16 out of 54 probation services took it up. Another project which has gone awry recently is \"government gateway\". This is supposed to be the system which joins together separate local government and health databases, while ensuring that only the right people have access. The system is due to be up and running in 2001. But in October, talks with the prime contractor, Compaq, broke down and a successor has yet to be found.</p> <p>\u0095 Resources. In September, Tony Blair promised \u00a31bn funding for electronic government as part of his \"UK online\" initiative. Local government will get \u00a3350m. Few on the front line regard this as generous. Local government is \"90% of government's face to most people\", says Chris Haynes, head of the information society programme at Knowsley council, Merseyside, one of the pioneering local authorities in IT. And at Suffolk, Miller says that experience shows the real problem is not the cost of computers, but of training. For every \u00a31 spent on IT, twice as much again goes into training and new procedures for staff.</p> <p>\"The 2005 target is a nonsense,\" concludes Haynes. \"Our real target is getting people in the community to benefit from the e-society.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Michael Cross is news editor of <a href=\"http://www.kablenet.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.kablenet.com</a> Information for Social Care is at <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/scg/information.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">www.doh.gov.uk/scg/information.htm</a></p>",

This is supposed to be the system which joins together separate local government and health databases, while ensuring that only the right people have access. The system is due to be up and running in 2001. But in October, talks with the prime contractor, Compaq, broke down and a successor has yet to be found. \u0095 Resources. In September, Tony Blair promised \u00a31bn funding for electronic government as part of his \"UK online\" initiative. Local government will get \u00a3350m. Few on the front line regard this as generous. Local government is \"90% of government's face to most people\", says Chris Haynes, head of the information society programme at Knowsley council, Merseyside, one of the pioneering local authorities in IT. And at Suffolk, Miller says that experience shows the real problem is not the cost of computers, but of training. For every \u00a31 spent on IT, twice as much again goes into training and new procedures for staff. \"The 2005 target is a nonsense,\" concludes Haynes. \"Our real target is getting people in the community to benefit from the e-society.\" \u0095 Michael Cross is news editor of www.kablenet.com Information for Social Care is at www.doh.gov.uk/scg/information.htm",

      "bodyText": "Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, injected passion and controversy back into the European debate yesterday with a call for future presidents of the European commission to be directly elected, to help the EU attain greater democratic legitimacy. Though such an idea is not on the agenda for next month's EU summit in Nice, British ministers are sufficiently nervous of a tabloid-driven public relations disaster at the summit that Downing Street quickly slapped down the \"hypothetical\" suggestion which has no official status, even in Germany. In a pointer to Tony Blair's thinking, No 10's deputy spokesman referred approvingly to \"the primacy of the council of ministers\" - the elected leaders of the 15 EU states who currently dominate the union's proceedings, rather than the commission, whose president is appointed. Speaking in the Belgian parliament, Mr Fischer - a hate figure for British eurosceptics because of his avowed federalism - argued that it is already necessary to look beyond Nice to answer the big questions about the EU's ultimate destination. \"Everywhere on our continent there is a desire to resume reflection on the merits and objectives of integration rather than the mechanisms of treaties or the size and shape of European cucumbers,\" he said. German officials said he intended the Brussels address to resume the debate about the future of the EU, following major speeches by the French president, Jacques Chirac, in the summer and Mr Blair in Warsaw last month. Mr Fischer himself invoked \"a European parliament and a European government which really do exercise power\" in a speech in May. Yesterday's remarks prompted the Tory foreign affairs spokesman, Francis Maude, to insist that \"the agenda to build an EU superstate is alive and well\".

In the countryside, it was a rarity. There was no national grid. If you wanted electricity you had to be wealthy and adventurous enough to put in your own generator - like William Keswick. </p> <p>For Keswick's great-grandson James Marriott, an artist who has turned his family history into a true saga of the reckless western guzzling of fossil fuels, these years were the beginning of his ancestors' descent into carbon addiction - a path they set out on early because of their wealth, but which we would all follow. </p> <p>It was a time when the individual choices of millions of people began to influence the climate, when men and women first began to be defined as consumers. Marxists and capitalists alike had a boundless belief in the virtue and inevitability of human progress, and the world seemed to be for taming and using, not protecting. </p> <p>Marriott's performance-work, Carbon Generations, which is part of an ongoing project by arts group Platform, looks at his family's energy use over four actual and three future generations, inspired by a tradition among Iroquois American Indians that leaders have to consider the impact of decisions on seven generations. </p> <p><strong> Past and future</strong><br> </p> <p> \"We're always being told in environmental debates that we have to consider the impact of what we do today on generations yet to come,\" said Marriott. \"But if at the same time we don't look at what past generations were doing to get us where we are today, we become lost.\" </p> <p>William Keswick, born in 1834, was a trader in the Far East from 1855 to 1886, when the first mass consumer use of a product refined from crude oil - paraffin - was taking off. He returned to England by coal-powered steamship, a journey lasting several weeks, and settled at Eastwick Park, a rambling Georgian pile. </p> <p>The house was occupied by the Keswick family and half a dozen live-in servants. Before the oil age, energy for hot water, cooking and heating rooms was supplied by coal. Travel was by horsepower and coal-powered train. </p> <p>How much coal the Keswick household used is hard to estimate, but James Marriott has worked out that another of his great-grandparents, Charles Marriott, had 25 fireplaces in his Leicestershire home, of which an average of eight were used daily, giving a figure of eight tonnes of coal a year. </p> <p>For the energy released, coal is a more potent source of carbon emissions than oil. If the Keswick family members had replaced coal power with oil power, they would have generated less carbon dioxide than before. Instead, they kept using coal, and began consuming oil as well. </p> <p>Not long before the Keswicks went electric, they acquired the family's first car, a Cadillac. Their chauffeur was responsible for running the generator as well as the car. After all, they both ran on oil. </p> <p>An early picture of William Keswick's Cadillac can be fixed in time - 1906 ,when Keswick won an election in Epsom. He died six years later. His fourth daughter, Kay, was born in 1904. She was James Marriot's great-aunt, and grew up into a more energy-rich world than her parents. </p> <p>With the launch of the National Grid in 1926, electric lights and household appliances such as radios became commonplace; huge coal and oil-fired power stations supplied the growing electrical demands of consumers and industry. </p> <p>Electric-powered industry was cleaner than its steam-powered predecessor, but because it was producing more consumer goods for the ever more affluent world, the overall carbon emissions were greater. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the west's love affair with the car grew apace. When Kay Keswick passed her driving test in 1925, at the age of 21, and bought a Citro\u00ebn for \u00a3150, her horizons broadened dramatically. </p> <p>\"At every stage of her life, oil was one of the underpinnings of her freedom,\" said Marriott. \"The freedom of driving in London in the 1920s, the freedom to travel by car through France and Italy in the 1930s. </p> <p>\"Oil underpinned the means by which she served her country - driving an army canteen in East Anglia, in north Africa, Italy and liberated Germany. She continued to drive until she was 92.\" </p> <p>Kay Keswick's niece, James Marriott's mother, Sally Coles, was born in 1937; Richard Marriott, his father, in 1930. Theirs was the generation that saw the dying of the coal industry in Britain, the end of the train's dominance of the mass transit market, and the explosive growth of consumer electrics in the home. </p> <p>In 1962, a year before James, their second son, was born the Marriotts, then living in West Sussex, abandoned coal fires and installed oil-fired central heating. This should have meant a big cut in the family's carbon emissions, but because of their increased car use and appetite for consumer goods, their overall carbon use was greater. </p> <p>They used electricity for cooking, but since the electricity was made by coal-fired power stations, their carbon emissions were simply transferred higher up the distribution tree. Although they acquired a Kenwood mixer in the 1950s, it was the 1960s that saw the electricity bill shoot up: they bought a washing machine, a record player, a television, a fridge and a tumble dryer. In the 1970s, they acquired a tape recorder and a freezer. </p> <p>James Marriott's generation lives a paradox - it is the first to feel guilt and a degree of fear about the consequences of what reckless burning of fossil fuels is doing to the climate, and the first to take long-distance air travel for granted. </p> <p><strong> Trips abroad</strong><br> </p> <p> He first flew in 1965, from Gatwick to Malta. Since then he has flown to Munich, Zurich, Barcelona, Pisa, Paris, New York (twice), Hong Kong, Beijing, Tokyo, Tel Aviv, Cairo, Amman, Malaga, Warsaw, Delhi, Kathmandu, Trabzon, Prague and Venice - a distance, at a rough estimate, in excess of 100,000 miles. That's the equivalent of around 8.5 tonnes of carbon. </p> <p>His 18 childhood return trips from Sussex to the family cottage in the Highlands would have used another 1.8 tonnes. </p> <p>A dedicated environmental activist, the younger Marriott, together with his partner, Jane Trowell, are trying to live the carbon-light life, but it is far from easy. They don't have a fridge, saving about 30kg (66lb) of carbon a year over their parents' generation. But they do have a personal computer, which uses 4kg a year for every hour of daily use. They don't have a car. But instead of oil-fired central heating or the more efficient gas, they use a wood-fired stove for heat and hot water. </p> <p>Wood produces even more carbon dioxide per kilo than coal. On the other hand, it comes from a local, renewable source. But Marriott knows it's not the answer. \"It's an elite game,\" he admits. \"Not everyone can get their energy from wood. Otherwise we'd need a forest bigger than Britain.\" </p> <p>Marriott and Trowell might have children, yet looking forward to the next three generations, they are anxious about the burden of carbon cutbacks they will inherit - according to one estimate, the average British household will need to cut back its current carbon output of 25 tonnes by 90% by 2040. </p> <p>\"I don't have a car or a fridge, but daily I utilise hydrocarbons in a myriad of unconscious ways,\" he said. \"Can I imagine doing my work without a phone or a computer? Will it come to that?\" </p> <p>He fears he may have no choice, and compares the future upheaval to that faced by his great-great-grandparents, who emigrated to Newfoundland from Scotland with little in the way of baggage. </p> <p>\"The sixth generation begins in 2020, the seventh in 2050,\" he said. \"All predictions suggest that it is the sixth generation that faces the largest challenges. Or rather that if we don't face up to our challenges now, and make changes now, the sixth generation will have to make drastic changes in order to avoid catastrophe in the seventh.\" </p> <p>\u2022 Carbon Generations is part of PLATFORM's ongoing project, 90% Crude.

Generic suffixes for personal web pages, including .per and .nom, may also be introduced. </p> <p>Experts say the move, similar to creating new telephone dialling codes, is needed to increase the capacity of the domain name system despite fears that new suffixes could trigger a fresh outbreak of cybersquatting, as speculators snap up well-known addresses with new suffixes to sell on for huge profits. </p> <p>Pam Brewster, at Icann, stressed that a limited number of domain names would be introduced \"in a responsible manner\". The Icann board is expected to approve between three and 20 top-level domain names at a conference in California tomorrow. </p> <p>Ms Brewster said there are a variety of reasons for introducing new names. \"Some people say all the good names are taken so we need more,\" she said. \"Some people want more domains to add more competition and diversity to the domain name system. It could also make it easier to find what you are looking for on the internet.\" </p> <p>The internet's naming system, featuring dot.com, .org and .net, alongside country codes such as .uk and .fr, has remained unchanged since its inception in the mid-1980s.. </p> <p>Numerous public figures, including Madonna, Jeanette Winterson and George W Bush, have fought cybersquatters for colonising their names on the net. Despite tough new US anti-cybersquatting laws, the global reach of the internet has made it difficult to prosecute websites which infringe upon registered trademarks. </p> <p>To deter cybersquatting on the new suffixes, Icann may initiate a \"sunrise\" early registration period, during which only trademark owners can buy names with the new endings. </p> <p>The price of internet \"real estate\" has been driven up by firms competing for the dwindling number of prestigious dot.com addresses. Legal experts hope that increasing the supply of potential names may dissuade speculative squatters. </p> <p>\"If we have .biz as well as dot.com that should considerably reduce the extent to which cybersquatting is lucrative, but without in any way removing it,\" said Professor Graham Greenleaf from the University of New South Wales's faculty of law. </p> <p>New top-level domain names could also be used to regulate porn. If adult websites carry a .xxx suffix filtering software could more easily identify pornographic material, and prevent children accessing it. Although Icann suggested it was premature to release the naming convention before the ability to force the net porn industry to adopt it. </p> <p>Firms who sell registered domain names stand to make the most from the reforms, as those with a dot.com address rush to re-register their name. </p> <p>Internet registration firms are playing down the potential boom, however. </p> <p>\"I think it will make an impact but not a huge one,\" said Pablo Kleckin of Domain Names Australia. \"Anybody who thinks a new whizz-bang three-letter suffix is going to outdo a dot.com is not really being realistic. The dot.com is still the holy grail of the domain names. If you can get a sexy name in a dot.com you've got a licence to go global with your business.\"</p>",

Experts say the move, similar to creating new telephone dialling codes, is needed to increase the capacity of the domain name system despite fears that new suffixes could trigger a fresh outbreak of cybersquatting, as speculators snap up well-known addresses with new suffixes to sell on for huge profits. Pam Brewster, at Icann, stressed that a limited number of domain names would be introduced \"in a responsible manner\". The Icann board is expected to approve between three and 20 top-level domain names at a conference in California tomorrow. Ms Brewster said there are a variety of reasons for introducing new names. \"Some people say all the good names are taken so we need more,\" she said. \"Some people want more domains to add more competition and diversity to the domain name system. It could also make it easier to find what you are looking for on the internet.\" The internet's naming system, featuring dot.com, .org and .net, alongside country codes such as .uk and .fr, has remained unchanged since its inception in the mid-1980s.. Numerous public figures, including Madonna, Jeanette Winterson and George W Bush, have fought cybersquatters for colonising their names on the net. Despite tough new US anti-cybersquatting laws, the global reach of the internet has made it difficult to prosecute websites which infringe upon registered trademarks. To deter cybersquatting on the new suffixes, Icann may initiate a \"sunrise\" early registration period, during which only trademark owners can buy names with the new endings. The price of internet \"real estate\" has been driven up by firms competing for the dwindling number of prestigious dot.com addresses. Legal experts hope that increasing the supply of potential names may dissuade speculative squatters. \"If we have .biz as well as dot.com that should considerably reduce the extent to which cybersquatting is lucrative, but without in any way removing it,\" said Professor Graham Greenleaf from the University of New South Wales's faculty of law. New top-level domain names could also be used to regulate porn. If adult websites carry a .xxx suffix filtering software could more easily identify pornographic material, and prevent children accessing it. Although Icann suggested it was premature to release the naming convention before the ability to force the net porn industry to adopt it. Firms who sell registered domain names stand to make the most from the reforms, as those with a dot.com address rush to re-register their name. Internet registration firms are playing down the potential boom, however. \"I think it will make an impact but not a huge one,\" said Pablo Kleckin of Domain Names Australia. \"Anybody who thinks a new whizz-bang three-letter suffix is going to outdo a dot.com is not really being realistic. The dot.com is still the holy grail of the domain names. If you can get a sexy name in a dot.com you've got a licence to go global with your business.\"",

Among a raft of measures aimed at calming consumer fears over mad cow disease, Mr Jospin also announced random tests on cattle entering the food chain and a tripling of funds for research into BSE, linked to the fatal brainwasting ailment in humans, new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. \"The government has decided to suspend the use of meat and bone meal in feed for pigs, chickens, fish as well as domestic animals,\" the prime minister said. \"This temporary and general ban appears technically possible and acceptable from a public health standpoint.\" A decision on a permanent ban on animal-based meals, a step taken by Britain in 1996, would be made once the national food safety agency, Afssa, had assessed the possible risk associated with them, he said, probably in about three to four months' time. Aware that the drastic new precautions might serve only to fan French fears, Mr Jospin sought to reassure consumers about the spread of BSE and about food safety in general, saying there was \"no scientific proof at present to suggest that eating beef or drinking milk poses a health risk\". But he added that cote de boeuf and several other prized French cuts of beef were being banned because the infectious agent that causes BSE could exist in the bone that comes with them, despite government precautions. Beef sales have plunged by as much as 50% in France and school meal services throughout the country have withdrawn the suspect meat from canteen menus since it emerged last month that several large supermarket chains had unknowingly sold potentially infected cuts. Consumer concern has been further fuelled by a sharp increase in the number of cattle found to have been suffering from mad cow disease, which under a more thorough and systematic screening system has jumped from 31 in all of 1999 to more than 90 so far this year. According to a poll published this weekend in the Journal du Dimanche, 70% of the French are worried about animal-based feeds, which were banned for cattle in France in 1990, and nearly 80% want an immediate ban. Most French cases of BSE have been traced to \"cross-contamination\" - cattle that have been fed, either deliberately or accidentally, with animal-based meals intended for livestock like pigs or chickens. The moratorium on the use of meat and bone meal marks a political defeat for the prime minister, who described the panic gripping French con sumers as \"a national psychosis\" and favoured what he termed the \"more calm and rational approach\" of waiting for Afssa's expert opinion before taking such a drastic step. Last week he underlined the major problem of banning the materials, saying France would be forced to incinerate three times as many animal carcasses as it does now: the pollutants like dioxin that entered the atmosphere as a result would represent a more serious health hazard than the original feed, he said. But Mr Jospin was outmanoeuvred by Mr Chirac, who grasped perfectly the mood of the French public last week and, to the prime minister's fury, publicly demanded an immediate ban on animal-based meals.

That cannot be right.\" Open justice and the public's \"overriding right to know the identities of those who committed serious and detestable crimes would be imperilled\", he said. Serious crime would then become a \"passport to anonymity\". The hearing continues today.",

He will tell a regional conference in the City of London that analysis of the government's own statistics indicates that a \"winners circle\" is emerging in the home counties and East Anglia with other regions slipping further behind. Calling for a \"radical regional policy\" to tackle north-south imbalances Mr Byers will warn that \"simply tinkering at the edges\" will no longer be enough to bring areas like the north-east and north-west up to the national average. His remarks will be interpreted by some as a direct challenge to the prime minis ter who has been at pains to stress that divisions within regions are wider than any north-south divide. Less than two weeks ago in the north-east, speaking alongside Mr Byers, Tony Blair sought to play up the region's success in creating new jobs. But the trade secretary, who represents a Tyneside shipbuilding constituency, has recently been strongly supporting backbench Labour MPs who argue that regions like the north-east are suffering at the expense of the south. Mr Byers will say today that recent figures in his department show that manufacturing businesses invested over 10 times as much in research and development in the south-east than in the north-east. \"Nearly one fifth of people of working age in the north-east and West Midlands have no qualifications at all - compared to just over 11% in the south-east,\" he plans to say. \"These are the underlying causes we need to tackle in regional policy - to widen the 'winners circle' and ensure all regions benefit from rising prosperity.\" Older manufacturing regions needed to be renewed. \"They were at the heart of the first industrial revolution and we must now ensure that they can play their part in the knowledge based economic revolution which is now taking place.\" \"Past policies have failed to resolve the underlying weakness of the least successful regions and have failed to capitalise on their strengths.\"",

      "body": "<p>Railtrack this week told its shareholders that \"better times are to come\". So they raised the dividend for shareholders by 5% (underlying inflation is 2%).</p> <p>That must have pleasantly surprised them on the day the company warned its profits were down by 31%. With the company near meltdown after Hatfield, the profit warning was only to be expected: \u00a3100m extra is being spent on crisis rail repairs, \u00a3150m must be paid to train-operating companies in compensation for all the chaos. But no worries, \"Better times are to come\".</p> <p>Where are \"better times\" to come from? There is only one source and every reason for shareholder confidence that it will deliver: the Treasury's 10-year plan for the railways is investing \u00a329bn of public money. Indeed, shareholders might expect continuing rises, for who controls how much of the subsidy given to this leaky bucket drips into dividends?</p> <p>Not us, says the rail regulator: \"That's a matter for a private company. No regulator ever comments on dividends or share prices of a utility.\" But this utility is different -dependent on state subsidy. Does the shadow strategic rail authority monitor dividends? Not us, they said: \"Dividends are a matter for Railtrack alone to decide. You could try the rail regulator ... \"No doubt the Treasury keeps an eye, but what sort of Chinese walls allow money pouring in one end to seep out the other?</p> <p>Another question: which purchasers of Railtrack shares ever thought this company - alone among all Europe's railways systems - was ever going to make money, except via the cash-cow of government subsidy? With train tickets already the highest in the world due to decades of lowest subsidies, higher fares will not provide \"better times\" for Railtrack shareholders.</p> <p>As for those train operators who have made money on profitable lines, with no cross-subsidy possible under this chopped-up privatisation, some have been busily reinvesting profits in transport systems abroad, says Transport 2000. So state money leaks from the railways that way too.</p> <p>Railtrack is now worth \u00a35bn. From 1997 to this March, Labour had already paid out exactly that sum in railway subsidy, with much more to come. So why doesn't the government own it by now - or at least a significant slice of the shares? Why has it got nothing at all for our money? If the exchequer were a bank it would have repossessed this effectively bankrupt business long ago in exchange for its lost cash.</p> <p>Forget sleaze, forget Aitken's lies and Hamilton's brown envelopes. Of all the scandals that engulfed the Major government, nothing tops the reckless, ideological sale of British Rail. They were drivers who went through a score of red stop signals, feet on the dashboard, swag-bag hanging on the dead man's handle. They were told countless times by their own experts that it could not and would not work - especially in the shambolic form they chose. They pushed it through a month before their deserved demise, leaving this dynamite on the tracks of their successors.</p> <p>It was a deliberate and wicked piece of political vandalism. Boys putting bricks on the line would be in prison, but they sit on boards: there is no redress against ministerial malpractice. When you ask them, they say they have nothing to apologise for. \"No regrets,\" said Sir George Young yesterday. Same goes for John MacGregor, though he adds in sanguine tones, \"Of course we would always have made a few changes as it went along.\"</p> <p>What sort of changes? Probably much the same as Labour's - dollops of dosh. The reason Margaret Thatcher wanted to privatise British Rail was the very reason it was impossible - it always required a huge state subsidy. Only absurdist upside-down accounting could ever produce figures that could make it look \"private\". John Major cannot have believed figures that budgeted for an ever-decreasing state-subsidy, de-escalating year by year: this year, according to their fantasy accounts, subsidy should have dipped well below a billion. Instead, it's up and up.</p> <p>Back in the mists of time it began with the Adam Smith Institute, the very clever far-right thinktank that devised the poll tax. If John Major was still in power, no doubt recent rail events would have brought him down as surely as the poll tax destroyed Mrs Thatcher. The institute's first clever idea which Mrs Thatcher briefly fancied, was to tear up all the rails and put toll-roads in their place. Ideas puffed up and down the line but rightly got nowhere.</p> <p>Finally John Major grasped at it, needing a privatisation of his own. His Hovis view of Britain imagined a Hornby railway in the old private liveries of the Great Western and Great Eastern. But market ideology demanded competition, not regional monopoly, so BR was sliced all ways - cut into regions as well as split between track and flotillas of train operators, 150 contracts dispersing accountability like confetti. Who is to blame? All of them - John Major most of all. (Does he write condolences for the fatalities?)</p> <p>The rails were sold to Railtrack for just \u00a31.93bn, the whole of BR raised only \u00a35bn, a disgracefully low price: they pretended they were getting rid of a liability. Asked yesterday who was to blame for this gross fiscal negligence, those Tories said, amazingly, it was Clare Short's fault. Why? Because as shadow transport minister, she vowed Labour would renationalise it, which depressed its selling price.</p> <p>Of course, all such talk was stopped dead by pre-election New Labour, afraid of old Labour imagery. Besides, they said, money must be spent on transport renewal, not on compensating shareholders. But did they realise they'd be investing more than 15 times enough for Railtrack to fall back into their hands anyway under normal rules of business, if they wanted it?</p> <p>For some reason, they don't want it, though the longer they are in office, the more they take the blame anyway for anything that happens on the railway. Voters' memories are short, train delays long. Prudence would take back what is already paid for and put it in a trust, able to borrow money. Train operators can fall back as their franchises expire.</p> <p>Labour cannot do the same to London Underground. No, they say, it's quite different. Not different enough. The New York subway genius, Robert Kiley, a wise and astute politician, may find a third way face-saver to rescue both Labour and Ken Livingstone. But if Kiley walks away declaring the PPP unworkable, there will be no rescuing Labour.</p> <p>Imagine the next tube disaster: (they happen roughly every 15 years, it's now year 13.) Labour ministers and 51 London MPs must each take personal responsibility on this. All \"privatisation\" of publicly financed services - hospitals or trains - makes profit straight from the public purse. The idea that their superior efficiency earns those profits is a fairytale that died at Hatfield.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Railtrack this week told its shareholders that \"better times are to come\". So they raised the dividend for shareholders by 5% (underlying inflation is 2%). That must have pleasantly surprised them on the day the company warned its profits were down by 31%. With the company near meltdown after Hatfield, the profit warning was only to be expected: \u00a3100m extra is being spent on crisis rail repairs, \u00a3150m must be paid to train-operating companies in compensation for all the chaos. But no worries, \"Better times are to come\". Where are \"better times\" to come from? There is only one source and every reason for shareholder confidence that it will deliver: the Treasury's 10-year plan for the railways is investing \u00a329bn of public money. Indeed, shareholders might expect continuing rises, for who controls how much of the subsidy given to this leaky bucket drips into dividends? Not us, says the rail regulator: \"That's a matter for a private company. No regulator ever comments on dividends or share prices of a utility.\" But this utility is different -dependent on state subsidy. Does the shadow strategic rail authority monitor dividends? Not us, they said: \"Dividends are a matter for Railtrack alone to decide. You could try the rail regulator ... \"No doubt the Treasury keeps an eye, but what sort of Chinese walls allow money pouring in one end to seep out the other? Another question: which purchasers of Railtrack shares ever thought this company - alone among all Europe's railways systems - was ever going to make money, except via the cash-cow of government subsidy? With train tickets already the highest in the world due to decades of lowest subsidies, higher fares will not provide \"better times\" for Railtrack shareholders. As for those train operators who have made money on profitable lines, with no cross-subsidy possible under this chopped-up privatisation, some have been busily reinvesting profits in transport systems abroad, says Transport 2000. So state money leaks from the railways that way too. Railtrack is now worth \u00a35bn. From 1997 to this March, Labour had already paid out exactly that sum in railway subsidy, with much more to come. So why doesn't the government own it by now - or at least a significant slice of the shares? Why has it got nothing at all for our money? If the exchequer were a bank it would have repossessed this effectively bankrupt business long ago in exchange for its lost cash. Forget sleaze, forget Aitken's lies and Hamilton's brown envelopes. Of all the scandals that engulfed the Major government, nothing tops the reckless, ideological sale of British Rail. They were drivers who went through a score of red stop signals, feet on the dashboard, swag-bag hanging on the dead man's handle. They were told countless times by their own experts that it could not and would not work - especially in the shambolic form they chose. They pushed it through a month before their deserved demise, leaving this dynamite on the tracks of their successors. It was a deliberate and wicked piece of political vandalism. Boys putting bricks on the line would be in prison, but they sit on boards: there is no redress against ministerial malpractice. When you ask them, they say they have nothing to apologise for. \"No regrets,\" said Sir George Young yesterday. Same goes for John MacGregor, though he adds in sanguine tones, \"Of course we would always have made a few changes as it went along.\" What sort of changes? Probably much the same as Labour's - dollops of dosh. The reason Margaret Thatcher wanted to privatise British Rail was the very reason it was impossible - it always required a huge state subsidy. Only absurdist upside-down accounting could ever produce figures that could make it look \"private\". John Major cannot have believed figures that budgeted for an ever-decreasing state-subsidy, de-escalating year by year: this year, according to their fantasy accounts, subsidy should have dipped well below a billion. Instead, it's up and up. Back in the mists of time it began with the Adam Smith Institute, the very clever far-right thinktank that devised the poll tax. If John Major was still in power, no doubt recent rail events would have brought him down as surely as the poll tax destroyed Mrs Thatcher. The institute's first clever idea which Mrs Thatcher briefly fancied, was to tear up all the rails and put toll-roads in their place. Ideas puffed up and down the line but rightly got nowhere. Finally John Major grasped at it, needing a privatisation of his own. His Hovis view of Britain imagined a Hornby railway in the old private liveries of the Great Western and Great Eastern. But market ideology demanded competition, not regional monopoly, so BR was sliced all ways - cut into regions as well as split between track and flotillas of train operators, 150 contracts dispersing accountability like confetti. Who is to blame? All of them - John Major most of all. (Does he write condolences for the fatalities?) The rails were sold to Railtrack for just \u00a31.93bn, the whole of BR raised only \u00a35bn, a disgracefully low price: they pretended they were getting rid of a liability. Asked yesterday who was to blame for this gross fiscal negligence, those Tories said, amazingly, it was Clare Short's fault. Why? Because as shadow transport minister, she vowed Labour would renationalise it, which depressed its selling price. Of course, all such talk was stopped dead by pre-election New Labour, afraid of old Labour imagery. Besides, they said, money must be spent on transport renewal, not on compensating shareholders. But did they realise they'd be investing more than 15 times enough for Railtrack to fall back into their hands anyway under normal rules of business, if they wanted it? For some reason, they don't want it, though the longer they are in office, the more they take the blame anyway for anything that happens on the railway. Voters' memories are short, train delays long. Prudence would take back what is already paid for and put it in a trust, able to borrow money. Train operators can fall back as their franchises expire. Labour cannot do the same to London Underground. No, they say, it's quite different. Not different enough. The New York subway genius, Robert Kiley, a wise and astute politician, may find a third way face-saver to rescue both Labour and Ken Livingstone. But if Kiley walks away declaring the PPP unworkable, there will be no rescuing Labour. Imagine the next tube disaster: (they happen roughly every 15 years, it's now year 13.) Labour ministers and 51 London MPs must each take personal responsibility on this. All \"privatisation\" of publicly financed services - hospitals or trains - makes profit straight from the public purse. The idea that their superior efficiency earns those profits is a fairytale that died at Hatfield. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

      "byline": "John Vidal",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Dr Conrad Gorinsky is an ethnobotanist, prospector, environmentalist and, on his mother's side, a member of the Atorad tribe in Guyana. He stands accused on four continents of being a \"biological (or bio-) pirate\" - someone who identifies and extracts material from plants for profit.</p> <p> Earlier this year, having spent months in Amazonia with the Wapishana tribe, he patented a chemical protein of the greenheart tree, one of the most valuable woods in Guyana but one of the most threatened by logging. The nut of the greenheart (Ocotea rodiaei) produces an ingredient called tipir. Gorinsky's description to the US patent office, says this is an antipyretic, capable of preventing the return of diseases like malaria, and useful in treating cancer and perhaps even the Aids virus. </p> <p> But Tipir's medicinal properties are also well known to the Wapishana who grate the nut and use it to stop haemorrhages, prevent infections, as a contraceptive and to provoke abortions. Gorinsky named the ingredient \"rupununine\", and has run into a political row and a potential court case. The tribe is furious saying that their knowledge has been stolen. They want the patent rescinded and compensation and are being helped by Brazilian lawyers and northern groups. Gorinsky, who is seeking investors, is unrepentant. \"Tough, isn't it?\", he says. \"I was not the only person looking at the greenheart. I just picked up a nut and said 'what can I do with this?'. I have analysed the chemical structure but I have not patented the tree or a life process. How can I tell the Wapishana about the science? They just inherited the greenheart. They don't own it. I have invested in this with my own money\". </p> <p> But behind Gorinsky marches an army of biotechnology, agricultural, cosmetic and phamaceutical corporations, all linking with northern governments, foundations, universities, institutions, botanical gardens, museums and individuals who don't recognise such a distinction in their bid to seek and patent genes and the proteins that they express. They're known as bioprospectors - or biopirates depending on your point of view. </p> <p> Gorinsky's defence that he is realising benefits to humankind is countered by critics who argue that stealing knowledge is a question of national sovereignty. The gene rush is speeding up as it is realised that every gene and property of every plant and animal down to the smallest microbe is potentially patentable and thus available for commercial ownership and profit. It has no boundaries and is only limited by people's understanding of the fiendishly complex patent laws. Companies with large legal budgets for patent lawyers often understand it best.</p> <p> The big prizes, and the first to have been patented, say watchdog groups like Action Aid, Grain and Rafi, are the staple cereal crops with huge global commercial value like rice, maize, wheat, millet, sorghum, soya and cassava. Patent protection by agri-business companies now covers many of their genes and gene sequences, compounds and properties. </p> <p> Then come the common vegetables like the root crops and brassicas, bushes like cocoa and coffee and fruits. They and plants such as the tomato have all had some or many genes patented and many are near or in commercial production. A third category of potentially massive value are the 35,000 plants believed to have some pharmaceutical value. </p> <p> The race is led from the front by the US. There the government is subsidising bio-prospecting by awarding large grants to companies like Glaxo-Wellcome, American Cyanamid, and Monsanto. The US National Cancer Institute alone has collected and genetically screened over 50,000 plants and animals samples from plants and micro-organisms in 30 countries. The US army is known to hold gene patents on tropical disease treatments, including a Pacific plant called mamala (Homolanthus acuminatus) widely used in Samoa as a medicine, and micro-organisms which could be used in biological warfare. Meanwhile, drug giant Pfizer wants a deal with the Ecuadorean government for exlusive access to the genetic material of every plant in the botanically super-rich country.</p> <p>The prospectors have concentrated on the traditional pharmacopia of developing countries. At least 35,000 plants are thought to have medicinal value alone. The companies are finding rich pickings by working with traditional healers. Almost 90 per cent of the plants used by Samoan shamans have displayed significant biological activity when tested. Many have now been patented. Indian researcher Devinder Sharma fears that the whole Ayurvedic traditional base, based on up to 7,000 plants, is being systematically patented. </p> <p> Despite the fact that patent law insists the invention must be \"novel\" patents are still being granted on properties which have been well known for generations. For example, the University of Mississippi has US patent no 5,401,504 on turmeric, which Indians have long known can heal wounds faster. There are more than 400 patents, mostly by the giant agro-chemical companies, on Bacillus thuringiensis gene sequences, long known as an insecticide and now the basis of Bt cotton, wheat, maize and potato. Belgium's Plant Genetic Systems has a US patent for \"all transgenic plants containing Bt\". Meanwhile, the US Mycogen company, owned by Dow, has a European patent covering the insertion of \"any insecticidal gene in any plant\". Such broad patents, say critics, confer huge market power to the company that wins. </p> <p> Individual biologists, chemists, and healers are being offered ad hoc payments, but because of outrage in the south, increasingly, compensation agreements are being made with communities and governments. The University of Chicago, the Missouri Botanical Garden and the New York Botanical Garden have all signed \"bio-prospecting\" agreements. The US National Cancer Institute has signed up with Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guyana, India, the Philippines, Russia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Critics argue that the agreements are often vague and legally-contestable and just to challenge a patent in a US court may cost upwards of $300,000 - well beyond the reach of almost all commnities. </p> <p> Actionaid, which has investigated the gene rush, fears that the rush for patents could undermine the economies of developing countries. \"The potential for consequences of genetic patenting of plants are horrific\", they say. \"We respect the public interest arguments of those who do not believe that human genes should be patented. The logic must be extended to staple crops and all farming.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dr Conrad Gorinsky is an ethnobotanist, prospector, environmentalist and, on his mother's side, a member of the Atorad tribe in Guyana. He stands accused on four continents of being a \"biological (or bio-) pirate\" - someone who identifies and extracts material from plants for profit. Earlier this year, having spent months in Amazonia with the Wapishana tribe, he patented a chemical protein of the greenheart tree, one of the most valuable woods in Guyana but one of the most threatened by logging. The nut of the greenheart (Ocotea rodiaei) produces an ingredient called tipir. Gorinsky's description to the US patent office, says this is an antipyretic, capable of preventing the return of diseases like malaria, and useful in treating cancer and perhaps even the Aids virus. But Tipir's medicinal properties are also well known to the Wapishana who grate the nut and use it to stop haemorrhages, prevent infections, as a contraceptive and to provoke abortions. Gorinsky named the ingredient \"rupununine\", and has run into a political row and a potential court case. The tribe is furious saying that their knowledge has been stolen. They want the patent rescinded and compensation and are being helped by Brazilian lawyers and northern groups. Gorinsky, who is seeking investors, is unrepentant. \"Tough, isn't it?\", he says. \"I was not the only person looking at the greenheart. I just picked up a nut and said 'what can I do with this?'. I have analysed the chemical structure but I have not patented the tree or a life process. How can I tell the Wapishana about the science? They just inherited the greenheart. They don't own it. I have invested in this with my own money\". But behind Gorinsky marches an army of biotechnology, agricultural, cosmetic and phamaceutical corporations, all linking with northern governments, foundations, universities, institutions, botanical gardens, museums and individuals who don't recognise such a distinction in their bid to seek and patent genes and the proteins that they express. They're known as bioprospectors - or biopirates depending on your point of view. Gorinsky's defence that he is realising benefits to humankind is countered by critics who argue that stealing knowledge is a question of national sovereignty. The gene rush is speeding up as it is realised that every gene and property of every plant and animal down to the smallest microbe is potentially patentable and thus available for commercial ownership and profit. It has no boundaries and is only limited by people's understanding of the fiendishly complex patent laws. Companies with large legal budgets for patent lawyers often understand it best. The big prizes, and the first to have been patented, say watchdog groups like Action Aid, Grain and Rafi, are the staple cereal crops with huge global commercial value like rice, maize, wheat, millet, sorghum, soya and cassava. Patent protection by agri-business companies now covers many of their genes and gene sequences, compounds and properties. Then come the common vegetables like the root crops and brassicas, bushes like cocoa and coffee and fruits. They and plants such as the tomato have all had some or many genes patented and many are near or in commercial production. A third category of potentially massive value are the 35,000 plants believed to have some pharmaceutical value. The race is led from the front by the US. There the government is subsidising bio-prospecting by awarding large grants to companies like Glaxo-Wellcome, American Cyanamid, and Monsanto. The US National Cancer Institute alone has collected and genetically screened over 50,000 plants and animals samples from plants and micro-organisms in 30 countries. The US army is known to hold gene patents on tropical disease treatments, including a Pacific plant called mamala (Homolanthus acuminatus) widely used in Samoa as a medicine, and micro-organisms which could be used in biological warfare. Meanwhile, drug giant Pfizer wants a deal with the Ecuadorean government for exlusive access to the genetic material of every plant in the botanically super-rich country. The prospectors have concentrated on the traditional pharmacopia of developing countries. At least 35,000 plants are thought to have medicinal value alone. The companies are finding rich pickings by working with traditional healers. Almost 90 per cent of the plants used by Samoan shamans have displayed significant biological activity when tested. Many have now been patented. Indian researcher Devinder Sharma fears that the whole Ayurvedic traditional base, based on up to 7,000 plants, is being systematically patented. Despite the fact that patent law insists the invention must be \"novel\" patents are still being granted on properties which have been well known for generations. For example, the University of Mississippi has US patent no 5,401,504 on turmeric, which Indians have long known can heal wounds faster. There are more than 400 patents, mostly by the giant agro-chemical companies, on Bacillus thuringiensis gene sequences, long known as an insecticide and now the basis of Bt cotton, wheat, maize and potato. Belgium's Plant Genetic Systems has a US patent for \"all transgenic plants containing Bt\". Meanwhile, the US Mycogen company, owned by Dow, has a European patent covering the insertion of \"any insecticidal gene in any plant\". Such broad patents, say critics, confer huge market power to the company that wins. Individual biologists, chemists, and healers are being offered ad hoc payments, but because of outrage in the south, increasingly, compensation agreements are being made with communities and governments. The University of Chicago, the Missouri Botanical Garden and the New York Botanical Garden have all signed \"bio-prospecting\" agreements. The US National Cancer Institute has signed up with Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guyana, India, the Philippines, Russia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Critics argue that the agreements are often vague and legally-contestable and just to challenge a patent in a US court may cost upwards of $300,000 - well beyond the reach of almost all commnities. Actionaid, which has investigated the gene rush, fears that the rush for patents could undermine the economies of developing countries. \"The potential for consequences of genetic patenting of plants are horrific\", they say. \"We respect the public interest arguments of those who do not believe that human genes should be patented. The logic must be extended to staple crops and all farming.\"",

Ag-bio is less so,\" says Dave Hales, a biotech consultant at Ernst &amp; Young. \"It seems to touch a raw nerve with the public much more than biotech on the therapeutic side does.\" </p> <p> What's at stake in the biotechnology revolution is the ability of companies to fiddle with the genetic make-up of seeds to produce crops with stronger attributes such as taste, size, disease resistance or shelf life. This is why companies are applying for patents on the gene sequences of plants, for example identifying the gene which triggers sweetness or increases yield. The gene patent acts as a deterrent to other companies, but is no more than the starting block for research into a genetic modification which could be commercially profitable.</p> <p> Britain's first experience of a genetically modified product was tomato puree which was developed by Zeneca, the life sciences company which was originally part of the huge chemicals group ICI. Ian Weatherhead, a spokesman for Zeneca Agrochemicals, says: \"We adjusted an enzyme in the tomatoes so that they would ripen normally but they softened less readily. It made them firmer, which was a huge bonus for processing.\" </p> <p> Gene patents are crucial to the development of such products, claim companies like Zeneca (which is now part of the Anglo-Swedish group AstraZeneca) to prevent competitors from simply copying them. To get the patent granted, it is not enough to identify the gene sequence, there also has to be an \"inventive step\".</p> <p> Critics anxious about the power of a handful of western multinationals who dominate ag-bio, contend that the corporations are over-zealous in their patenting and are permitted by lax regulators to obtain protection over crops by adding the simplest of \"inventive steps\". </p> <p> Increasingly, what concerns critics of the ag-bio industry is the growing concentration of ownership in the hands of a relatively small number of major companies. Zeneca Agrochemicals is about to be merged with the agricultural arm of the Swiss group Novartis, to form the world's biggest player in food biotechnology, called Syngenta, with worldwide sales of $7.4bn (\u00a35.1bn).

      "bodyText": "\"Biotechnology in drugs is well regulated and well understood. Ag-bio is less so,\" says Dave Hales, a biotech consultant at Ernst &amp; Young. \"It seems to touch a raw nerve with the public much more than biotech on the therapeutic side does.\" What's at stake in the biotechnology revolution is the ability of companies to fiddle with the genetic make-up of seeds to produce crops with stronger attributes such as taste, size, disease resistance or shelf life. This is why companies are applying for patents on the gene sequences of plants, for example identifying the gene which triggers sweetness or increases yield. The gene patent acts as a deterrent to other companies, but is no more than the starting block for research into a genetic modification which could be commercially profitable. Britain's first experience of a genetically modified product was tomato puree which was developed by Zeneca, the life sciences company which was originally part of the huge chemicals group ICI. Ian Weatherhead, a spokesman for Zeneca Agrochemicals, says: \"We adjusted an enzyme in the tomatoes so that they would ripen normally but they softened less readily. It made them firmer, which was a huge bonus for processing.\" Gene patents are crucial to the development of such products, claim companies like Zeneca (which is now part of the Anglo-Swedish group AstraZeneca) to prevent competitors from simply copying them. To get the patent granted, it is not enough to identify the gene sequence, there also has to be an \"inventive step\". Critics anxious about the power of a handful of western multinationals who dominate ag-bio, contend that the corporations are over-zealous in their patenting and are permitted by lax regulators to obtain protection over crops by adding the simplest of \"inventive steps\". Increasingly, what concerns critics of the ag-bio industry is the growing concentration of ownership in the hands of a relatively small number of major companies. Zeneca Agrochemicals is about to be merged with the agricultural arm of the Swiss group Novartis, to form the world's biggest player in food biotechnology, called Syngenta, with worldwide sales of $7.4bn (\u00a35.1bn).

In a series of court judgements, the US Patent and Trademark Office has been forced to concede what they wanted. But it did not satisfy them. </p> <p> The US biotech lobby and their feisty counterparts across the Atlantic, wanted the same kind of patent protection in Europe and the wider world. After a long struggle with European legislators, they seemed to have succeeded in 1998 with the passage of an EU directive allowing the patenting of genes.

The EPO is a dinosaur, left over from an earlier age of European cooperation. It issues patents covering 20 European countries - not just the EU. It is headed by a German named Ingo Kober and gets its powers from a treaty called the European Patent Convention. It can issue Euro-wide patents - most US patent holders use it to extend their patents to Europe - and allows patents issued by national patent offices to extend across the continent.

In theory, it is answerable to convention signatories, but in practice, it is left to its own devices. </p> <p> The EPO's advantage is that a patent it grants is valid in all signatory states, and can be defended in national law. To make this possible, national patent laws have been harmonised. But the biotech lobby was unhappy about the convention's woolly references to \"morality\" and \"public order\", unhappy that it didn't specifically allow gene patenting, and even more unhappy that the EPO kept issuing contradictory decisions on biopatents in general. So it began its campaign to get the EU to \"clarify\" the convention - even though the EU had no right to do so. </p> <p> Hence the 1998 EU patenting directive, which specifically allowed the patenting of genes. But this left the EPO in an awkward position. Some of the signatories of the convention which had set it up weren't in the EU. Mr Kober decided he would not let this worry him, and asked his administrative council - representatives of the national patent offices - to let him implement it anyway. They agreed. The EPO argues it was acting within its rights.

When in 1984 Robert Gallo in the US and Luc Montagnier in France simultaneously claimed the discovery of, and then tried to patent diagnostic tests for the virus that caused the then new disease of Aids, they triggered a series of running battles over the genetic sequence of the human immunodeficiency virus that had to be resolved by agreement between President Jacques Chirac and President Ronald Reagan that the spoils might be shared. </p> <p> According to William Haseltine, now chief of Human Genome Sciences in Maryland, US, the rush for patents did not hamper Aids research. In those days, he worked with the team that deciphered the DNA of the HIV virus, and then worked out the sequences of its genes, and discovered some of the proteins those genes made.

I can think of no case in which a patent has ever inhibited an academic scientist.\" </p> <p> He thinks that patents speeded up the assault on the virus itself. Protected by licences from the patent holder, scientists at Merck, the big pharmaceutical company, could examine the precise atomic structure of a protein used by the virus, and then begin to design a precise atomic spanner called a protease inhibitor to shove in its works. Such drugs are expensive, but in the developing world, they have dramatically cut deaths from Aids. </p> <p> Dr Haseltine is still involved in the war against Aids: in February his biotech business Human Genome Sciences - with more than 7,500 applications for patents on human genes already - was issued a US patent on the CCR5 receptor gene. It is one of a class of things on the surface of the cell that could provide a target for a drug: to treat allergies, to relieve indigestion and cure ulcers, to treat migraine or relieve inflammation. But, the patent application also pointed out, it was one of those structures that a virus uses to bind to a cell. Other researchers confirmed what might have been seen by some as a hunch: that the CCR5 receptor gene makes a protein that the HIV virus uses to smuggle itself into an immune cell. People who don't have a functional CCR5 receptor gene don't seem to get infected with with HIV. The gene could be the key to a new class of treatment for one of the world's most difficult diseases. </p> <p> By then, Human Genome Sciences had the patent on the gene in the US, and had applied for a European patent on it too. Dr Haseltine doesn't have to look for the other component, the piece of genetic machinery the virus itself uses to lock on to human cell it is about to hi-jack: that was identified years ago, he says. But this lock-and-key approach - the DNA machinery of the pathogen, and the genetic description of its human target - is about to change medicine, alter lives and reshape economies. </p> <p> Biotech firms and university researchers are combing the genetic sequences of pathogens and plants, animals and algae for possible new treatments for cholera and tuberculosis, for vaccines for malaria and meningitis, for new kinds of weapons against antibiotic resistance. They are examining harmless bacilli that might help block bowel disease, and ulcerative colitis. </p> <p> The first patent on a living organism was on a genetically-altered microbe that digested oil spills: now genetically-altered bacteria are the new microfactories and microbes have become the workaday instruments of multinationals. Researchers have patented DNA from the thermophiles, the bacteria that multiply at the boiling point of water, because they want to find enzymes that survive cooking. They have begun exploring psychrophiles or cold-lovers that survive in the Arctic because they need enzymes that work at refrigerator temperatures for the perfume industry, and acidophiles that can survive in vinegar, and alkalophiles that can survive laundry detergents, and salt-loving bacteria that could help extract more crude oil from subterranean wells. </p> <p> Microbes like these may be the ultimate bedrock of industry: two years ago a team from the University of Georgia tried to assess the number of bacteria on the planet. They arrived at a figure with 30 zeroes in it. They tried to calculate the mass of all the carbon in those bacteria. They figured that this totted up to more than the landmass of the United Kingdom.

Your avocado starter has just two patented genes, but the tomato has 774, the carrot 52, the cucumber 41 and the broccoli 38. Fancy some fish? Tuna, salmon, halibut have all had genes patented. So, too, have goldfish and carp, but they are not on the menu. A glass of wine? There are 21 patents on grape genes. </p> <p> Work over, there's time for a quick drink in the pub where one of the genes from the hops that go into making the beer have been patented and so have several in the tobacco you inhale. Need something stiffer, like a tequila? It's going to be a scarce drink, says the barman, because there's a chronic shortage of the drink's key raw ingredient, the cactus-like agave plant. Help may be on the way. Researchers are trying to patent one of its genes. </p> <p> For supper, perhaps a quick Indian. Virtually the whole subcontinent's menu has been patented, mainly for its pharmaceutical benefits, but also for flavourings and crop potential. The lentils in the dahl have five patented genes. There are 152 patents covering 584 sequences of rice. Chicken tikka? There are more than 500 gene sequences on chickens patented so far. Avigenics, a US biotech company, plans to create, using its patented technolgy, a strain of bird which has an extra large breast and with a DNA copyright tag inserted among its genes to stop anyone breeding it without permission. </p> <p> Back home. Just time for that TV gardening programme featuring roses and geraniums (one has had a gene patented for its red colouring, the other to help prolong the shelf life of cut blooms) and the late night wildlife film about bottle-nosed dolphins (one gene patented for its red blood cell potential), gorillas, chimps and oran-utangs - all of which have (patented) pharmaceutical potential. </p> <p> Can-t stick it? Well, a barnacle gene has been claimed for its adhesive potential. But, seriously, if your patented day is all too much, don't turn to drugs.

So, too, have goldfish and carp, but they are not on the menu. A glass of wine? There are 21 patents on grape genes. Work over, there's time for a quick drink in the pub where one of the genes from the hops that go into making the beer have been patented and so have several in the tobacco you inhale. Need something stiffer, like a tequila? It's going to be a scarce drink, says the barman, because there's a chronic shortage of the drink's key raw ingredient, the cactus-like agave plant. Help may be on the way. Researchers are trying to patent one of its genes. For supper, perhaps a quick Indian. Virtually the whole subcontinent's menu has been patented, mainly for its pharmaceutical benefits, but also for flavourings and crop potential. The lentils in the dahl have five patented genes. There are 152 patents covering 584 sequences of rice. Chicken tikka? There are more than 500 gene sequences on chickens patented so far. Avigenics, a US biotech company, plans to create, using its patented technolgy, a strain of bird which has an extra large breast and with a DNA copyright tag inserted among its genes to stop anyone breeding it without permission. Back home. Just time for that TV gardening programme featuring roses and geraniums (one has had a gene patented for its red colouring, the other to help prolong the shelf life of cut blooms) and the late night wildlife film about bottle-nosed dolphins (one gene patented for its red blood cell potential), gorillas, chimps and oran-utangs - all of which have (patented) pharmaceutical potential. Can-t stick it? Well, a barnacle gene has been claimed for its adhesive potential. But, seriously, if your patented day is all too much, don't turn to drugs. A gene from cannabis, the marijuana plant , has been patented by the University of Strathclyde.",

      "body": "<p>One hot, dusty day in September 1893, at the sound of the starting guns, the rich prairie soil of the Cherokee Strip in Oklahoma was darkened by a flowing wave of humanity, horses and wagons. The US government was giving away 13,000 square miles of Indian territory to any settler able to race fast enough to stake a claim. One hundred thousand men, women and children stormed across the starting line to seize their piece of land. </p> <p> More than a century after the Great Land Run became a symbol of the American frontier spirit, another rush for rights is under way. This time the claimants are in white lab coats and business suits, and the arena is the chemical sequence which makes us what we are: the set of genes each of us carries, in trillions of copies, in the cells of our bodies. </p> <p> Research commissioned by the Guardian shows that pharmaceutical companies, biotech firms of all sizes, government institutes and universities have filed patents on a staggering 127,000 human genes or partial human gene sequences. They have patented genes which make our brains work, which build our bones, which make our livers grow, which keep our hearts beating, which can give increased chances of getting cancer and which may predict our likelihood of becoming addicted to drugs. They've patented genes even before they know what they do: they've taken out speculative patents on treatments based on genes even though no such treatments exist. </p> <p> Our genes are nature's software - chemical codes honed by millions of years of evolution to fabricate the substances that make us what we are. Scientists' new knowledge of these codes, and their commonest flaws, promises to make the 21st century an era when some of the deadliest diseases are eradicated. By patenting gene sequences, the claimants argue, they are ensuring they will be able to recover the money they have spent to find them, and gain the financial incentive to work out how to use them to benefit humankind. Not so, argue the critics of gene patenting. For one thing, to claim exclusive rights to commercial exploitation of something everyone is born with is to abuse the patent system, which was set up to reward inventors, not discoverers.</p> <p> Some genes are more valuable than others. Professor Simon Lovestone, of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, is one of a group of several dozen scientists around the world about to spark off a new gene hunt when they publish the results of research pinpointing a region of human DNA where a gene contributing to the onset of Alzheimer's disease is to be found. One \"Alzheimer's\" gene, known as ApoE, has already been identified, but by itself it is a poor indicator of how likely someone is to get the disease. Patent control over a second Alzheimer's gene would make reliable advanced diagnosis more likely, and could contribute towards developing a cure. One estimate of the annual market for Alzheimer's therapy is \u00a3100 billion. An Alzheime's gene patent, even without a cure, would do wonders for a firm's share price in the cut-throat world of biotech competition.</p> <p> Had Prof Lovestone and his collaborators been working for a private firm, they would have held off publishing details of their discovery until they had found the exact location of the gene, recorded its chemical sequence, and filed a patent application. This is what the Icelandic firm, DeCode, did with its recent announcement that it had found a \"schizophrenia gene.\" By publishing early, Prof Lovestone's team throw the hunt open to everyone. A big private firm is quite likely to find the gene first, and patent it. If Lovestone et al find it, they may patent it too - a \"defensive\" patent, to keep the gene in the public domain.</p> <p> \"Our academic group will publish as soon as it can, in order that other groups may work on it,\" said Prof Lovestone. \"Of course it would cause me anguish if another group found the gene and patented it. We want to be the ones to find it because of normal academic competitiveness. If somebody else finds it and then clamps some kind of restriction on it which prevents others working on it, that would make me very unhappy.\" </p> <p> He could see the biotech companies' point of view: \"There is the argument that being able to patent genes encourages firms to spend large amounts of money on developing tests and therapies based on those genes. I don't know what's right and what's wrong, I really don't. I think it's genuinely difficult.</p> <p> I find the patenting of genes anathema, but equally I think it's absolutely essential that big pharmaceutical companies are involved in this kind of research. It's probably no longer possible for governments to sponsor this sort of work.\" </p> <p> The patenting of human genes tends to be seen as largely a US-driven phenomenon, fuelled by idiosyncratic American patent laws, but just as the Cherokee Land Run fades into insignificance compared to European appropriation of colonies, so European firms have become some of the most enthusiastic stakers of claims on human DNA. Patent applications on no fewer than 36,083 genes and DNA sequences - 28.5 per cent of the total claimed so far - have been filed by a single French firm, Genset. Andre Pernet, Genset\u00cds chief executive officer, said: \"It's going to be a race. The whole genome will have been patented two years from now, if it hasn't been done already.\" He said Genset did not claim patents on genetic data without \"adding to its usefulness\", although neither the company nor its partners have so far produced any treatments based on their patented sequences. </p> <p> Genset is working on drugs linked to two patented genes - one associated with prostate cancer, another with obesity. \"If I invest $45 million per year finding useful drug targets using isolation genetics and genomics, then I can demonstrate usefulness, and I think these are valid patents,\" said Pernet. </p> <p> So far, gene patent holders have trodden cautiously in enforcing their monopolies. They like to maintain, publicly, that they have not actually patented genes - only a specific use for them. But in gene patents, the written sequence of the gene's chemical code, and the description of its function, are usually the only novel things there. </p> <p> The Utah-based company Myriad Genetics, for instance, has patented two human genes, mutations which make women more susceptible to breast cancer. It has patented these in the context of a test for susceptibility to the disease - but the technology to carry out the tests is patented by other companies. What Myriad brings to the table in terms of \"novelty\" is the gene sequence and nothing more. One patent lawyer likened it to a lock and a key: all the locks are similar, but the key is unique. </p> <p> Patents aside, Myriad is trying to introduce something novel to the world of genetic testing - a monopoly. It has stopped US labs screening for mutations on a non-profit basis by demanding they pay a licence fee. In Britain, its local agent has taken a more cautious approach so far. The company claims it must recoup the $10 million it spent tracking down the genes. But much of the work involved was actually carried out by others, including non-commercial scientists in Britain who dispute Myriad's rights to ownership of one of the genes. </p> <p> In this complex and important area, one thing is clear: the British government is not going to rock the boat. Tony Blair's reported anxiety to keep genetic sequence information from the Human Genome Project in the public domain does not extend to keeping genes out of the patent arena. Judging by a parliamentary reply he gave in February when asked about Myriad's approach, he neither knows, nor cares, the difference between a genetic test and a drug, between a gene patent and the patent on a traditional medicine. </p> <p> \"We have no interest in the particular issue to which the honourable gentleman refers, other than to ensure that people get the best treatment possible,\" he said. \"We have no more interest in one specific drug than another.\"</p> <p> <strong> The patents</strong><br></p> <p>The information in this patent research was compiled by GeneWatch UK by searching the <a href=\"http://www.derwent.com\"> Derwent GENESEQ database</a>.

Since mentioning his complaint of last week about my capacious arse waddling along the Goldhawk Road, we learned of missives to my colleagues David McKie and Gary Younge. Now Tom Fountain and Mike Bradwell from the Bush Theatre - also, oddly, in the Goldhawk Road - forward a missive received after G2 ran their article about the importance of new writing in British theatre. \"What a pair of dimwits you make!\" begins Michael, on his beloved Telegraph writing paper. \"Good work never palls - Writing, like painting or music, has nothing to do with 'real life' or 'relevance'. It has to do with emotional truth, as Shakespeare made clear in Hamlet.

Since mentioning his complaint of last week about my capacious arse waddling along the Goldhawk Road, we learned of missives to my colleagues David McKie and Gary Younge. Now Tom Fountain and Mike Bradwell from the Bush Theatre - also, oddly, in the Goldhawk Road - forward a missive received after G2 ran their article about the importance of new writing in British theatre. \"What a pair of dimwits you make!\" begins Michael, on his beloved Telegraph writing paper. \"Good work never palls - Writing, like painting or music, has nothing to do with 'real life' or 'relevance'. It has to do with emotional truth, as Shakespeare made clear in Hamlet. But then you wouldn't have heard of him, would you?\" If anyone has any more Hendo gems, I have publishers interested in the concept of a witless, irony-free Henry Root, and would love to see them. \u0095 Just the four apologies today. 1) Bury's ground is Gigg (not Gig) Lane; 2) thanks to all who wrote to point out that \"religious\", as used in the Catholic Herald, has a technical meaning any remotely educated person should know; 3) Stephen Pound, the Mockney MP for Ealing, points out that \"the guv'nor\" (his wife) was in fact \"well chuffed\" with the dome, not \"well choked\"; 4) Alistair from Stirling sent the joke about \"super sex\", not Alistair Stirling.

You have joined the 21st century gold rush. You have staked out your claim, and you can exploit it. What you have is microscopically small - not tissue, not a cell, not even a chromosome but a tiny fragment of a chromosome - but it is an acorn from which a great oak forest may grow. </p> <p> You are part of an industry that barely existed five years ago, but which is now worth \u00a330bn. In Britain, there are already 450 biotechnology companies in the business of making something new from life. In Europe, there are probably 800 small and medium enterprises doing the same thing. In the US there are around 1300 such firms, all hoping to make a killing from life. The industry is growing at 20 per cent per year, on something which most people hadn't realised could be claimed as a possession at all: life. So far, private enterprise and public institutions have filed claims on more than 127,000 human genes or partial human gene sequences. Other groups have been ransacking the rest of creation for wealth-creating DNA, for genes that generate something that no ordinary chemical process could ever hope to fabricate. They are looking for tests, treatments, cures and vaccines for thousands of diseases; they are looking for new ways of delivering medicines and new ways of making medicines. They have been fossicking in the tropical forests, quizzing shamans and medicine men, turning over exotic crops in traditional kitchen gardens.</p> <p> They want to make old crops grow faster or keep better, or make new kinds of health food called nutraceuticals, or organic answers to industrial pollution. They have patents on biological information that may make you fat or thin, live longer or give birth more easily. They want to find the genes that prevent sponges from getting cancer, or slugs from getting skin diseases. They want to put more beef on bullocks, conjure up new fabrics based on the chemistry of spider's silk or make plastics you can grow in a field of potatoes. </p> <p> Modestly-sized companies have been filing patent claims at the rate of 100 a week, and then reassuring their shareholders with the potential of their portfolios. Many of them have staked claims on discoveries only possible because of years of research by scientists in academic institutions, who thought they were working for the public good, or for groups of patients cursed by congenital affliction. But many of them are also scientists who made a discovery, and formed a start-up company to exploit it. Many of them will fail: only about one patent in 14, of any kind, ever gets to market. But the ones that succeed could end up in a new plutocracy: lords of life and death and DNA. </p> <p> That is the apocalyptic view. Another way of looking at it is that a whole new generation of bright and often young risk-takers have seen an opportunity to relieve human suffering, treat once incurable illnesses and generate new possibilities, with no guarantee of ultimate success and the very limited protection of an old-fashioned and sometimes clumsy industrial instrument called a patent which gives them no more than a head start, a few years in which they can have their little corner of the field to themselves. A gene, for them, is not life. Life is an abstraction: you cannot patent it, nor anything inside a living thing. But a gene tidied up, topped and tailed, cloned and crystallised in a form you could post in a package is something else, they argue. It is the information behind a process that leads to a product that - once made - someone will be prepared to pay for. </p> <p> And a patent is no more than a temporary protection which prevents others from making money from that discovery. When businesses have filed a patent claim, they can publish, and other researchers all over the world can use what could be information of value in other ways. With a patent, they can risk the 10 years and the \u00a3100m needed to take a drug from idea to pharmacy counter. </p> <p> Britain has had patents since Tudor times; Thomas Jefferson launched a US patent office; Europe - a single market far larger than the EU - has a European Patent Office with 20 member nations. Europe hammered out a biotechnology directive in 1998, and pushed it through, and harmonised patent law to give European scientists and investors the chance to make one application for one big market, rather than separate applications for lots of little ones. It also - say the directive's opponents - gave European entrepreneurs the right to patent life, or to put it another way, to own it.</p> <p> The first gene-based patents were made 20 years ago, but they were few, and many were never exploited. Now, in the last two or three years, the biotech companies have been sprinting from the lab to the patent office, with applications by the armful. There has been intermittent anger and anxiety, but almost no public debate. European patent chiefs are meeting next week in Munich to revise the European Patent Convention. But it isn't clear that they are encouraging any discussion of the biotechnology directive that has turned genes into intellectual property, to be kept on a shelf, licensed to the highest bidders or simply lost in the tangle of takeovers and bankruptcies inevitable in new high-risk industries. </p> <p> What is clear is that European decisions are being driven by the American stampede for patents. The US patent office has different rules and a different philosophy and - critics say - a tendency to let applicants get away with very broad claims. A US chief biotechnology patent examiner implicitly conceded this when he warned this year that anyone who wanted to patent a new transgenic mouse would have to do more than just claim that it was useful as petfood. </p> <p> Patents are a human invention, and like humans, faulty. There are other built-in difficulties. By definition, patent officers have to make decisions about unheard-of propositions every day. Privately, some concede that if the European biotechnology directive were being introduced now, it would not have the same form. They, too, see potential problems. Could two separate groups patent the same piece of genetic information for two different functions? If so, there could be no question of anyone \"owning\" of a gene. That, says the UK Patent Office, is not clear: it needs a test case. There is a gentleman's agreement in the biotech industry that a patent does not prevent academic research, but the text of the legislation isn't quite clear on that point either. </p> <p> The practitioners do not quarrel with the patenting of genetic information, and they do not see it as claiming a monopoly on life. They see it as business as usual. But the new businessmen are in a game of monopoly, and this time the real estate is something intangible, and already incorporated by everybody, everywhere: genetic information. </p> <p> The systematic search for this information was begun 20 years ago by doctors and scientists in search of the causes of muscular dystrophy, or Huntington's disease, or thousands of other afflictions that have plagued families for generations, and the money for this search was raised by charities begun by those families. </p> <p> The search has widened, and accelerated: it has gone from muscular dystrophy to maize and manioc and myrrh and 10,000 other lifeforms in the forests and savannahs of the globe. If new products and effective new treatments emerge that are widely available, then that will be a benefit. </p> <p> The key phrase is: widely available. Because the alarm is that once again, natural resources intended to help the hungry, the sick, the desperate have been cornered by the rich world, which will use them to get richer. Once again, this gain is likely to be at the cost of the developing world.</p>",

That should have been 4km, a distance the train normally covered in 9 minutes. In the accompanying report and in a caption we referred to the vacuum created by the fire. This would not have happened. However, there would have been a reduction in pressure which would have allowed fresh air to enter the tunnel and fan the flames. \u0095 In a report headed India starts to count its losses, page 16, October 31, we said, \"There is nothing new about migration from the Indian subcontinent. It was, after all, Indian architects who built the great temples at Angkor Wat in Cambodia in the 12th century.\" The Khmer Institute has asked us to point out that scholars now generally accept that the temples were designed and constructed by the ancient Khmer people themselves. \u0095 In a paragraph at the end of a piece headed Ferguson in war of hearts and minds, page 34, yesterday, we said lawyers for Sir Alex Ferguson were seeking an apology and damages for an article in the BBC's Match of the Day magazine, written by Pat Murphy. Mr Murphy was not the author of the article involved in this dispute.

Early yesterday morning, the two women and one man who make up Palm Beach county's election-supervising body met to decide whether to recount their region's votes by hand. They did not gather behind closed doors, away from view. In fact they didn't meet behind doors of any kind: they held their session outside, on a makeshift platform, in front of the cameras and the crowds. This was not a press conference, but an actual discussion by three election commissioners. It took place right there, in the open: government in the sunshine.</p> <p>That little scene is typical of the mess America is in, one week after it was meant to have chosen a new president. To the naked eye, the Palm Beach session looked palpably absurd: a decision which could determine the next leader of the free world taken by a trio of amateurs, in barbecue conditions. Yet underneath that shambolic surface was a noble intent: truly open government. The same is true of so much of what has gone wrong here. The dizzying, chaotic torrent of rulings and reversals that came from a clutch of courts and commissions yesterday left most Americans bewildered, with the US media struggling to understand, let alone explain, them. It looked ridiculous.</p> <p>In almost every case, judgments were challenged because the decision-makers were accused of being biased or partisan: Florida's chief election official is a Republican, while the state's attorney-general is a Democrat - and both gave opposite advice on the legality of the hand count. On Monday a federal judge ruled in favour of the Al Gore camp, and was instantly condemned because he had been appointed to the bench by Bill Clinton. Yesterday no fewer than five judges in Palm Beach county stepped aside, one after the other, because they feared they would be seen as partial. The whole thing looks nuts.</p> <p>But look closer. The reason why none of these officials was deemed neutral was that they were all either elected or appointed democratically. If they had simply emerged, accountable to no one - like our own judiciary or quangocracy - the problem would not have arisen. But Americans prefer democracy. The same spirit lies behind that laughably complex \"butterfly\" ballot paper in Palm Beach county. It came about thanks to America's faith in true devolution, allow ing every region to do things, including ballot design, for themselves. As with that early-morning display of sunshine government, in America what looks like farce often conceals an admirable pursuit of democracy.</p> <p>It's worth remembering all this, as Britons join the rest of the world in a warm bath of smugness, jeering at the American behemoth for stumbling so clumsily. We should recall how we would cope if one of our elections ended up in a similar dead-heat. A hung parliament would be resolved by that titan of modern, streamlined democracy, Her Majesty the Queen: she would break the tie by inviting one party leader to form a government. And if there was a dispute over voting irregularities, who would resolve that? Would elected officials come before us to debate, before the cameras, under a cloudy Westminster sky? Or would a quango suddenly appear, some body of great and good which none of us had ever elected, never heard of and never seen?</p> <p>So we should pause before feeling too smug: much of America's current trouble comes from having too much democracy, not too little. Not that that makes it any easier for Americans to bear. They know they should follow the legal, democratic procedure - they've heard the ever-schoolmarmish Gore praise the last seven days as a national civics lesson - but they'd still like it over with. For once, George W Bush has come up with the perfect metaphor. Not with any words he has used - that really would be news -but rather with his face. Since the weekend it has been marked by a large blemish, hidden under a plaster. Americans see that and have a collective impulse: it's time to lance the boil.</p> <p>Finality is the word of the hour - election 2000's equivalent of \"closure\" during the impeachment farrago of 1998. The assumption is that finality will come when a president-elect is at last in place - even if that takes till noon on January 20, when one of these two men will raise his right hand and swear the oath of office.</p> <p>But is that right? Or might the radiation from this blast keep poisoning the atmosphere, contaminating the next presidency from now until 2004?</p> <p>The precedents are not encouraging. When Rutherford B Hayes won the presidency after failing to win the popular vote in 1876, he was mocked as \"His Fraudulency\". That fate could await W if he scrapes home in Florida but stays behind in the total national vote. People will always wonder what strings Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, pulled to deliver for his brother. The conspiracy theories are already circulating. One placard-holder at a Jesse Jackson protest rally on Monday night urged me to remember Bush Snr's former job - as director of the CIA.</p> <p>Gore's prospects are equally bleak. He knows the American right never regarded Clinton as a fully legitimate president - and he won two clear mandates. Imagine what they would do with a court-imposed President Gore.</p> <p>Whoever he is, the next president will take office under a dark cloud. A Gallup poll yesterday found that about a third of both Bush and Gore supporters would not accept the other as legitimate, even if he is declared the winner. Add to that a House and Senate all but split 50-50 and you see a Washington divided as it has not been since the aftermath of the civil war.</p> <p>The optimists wonder if this might lead to balance and cross-party cooperation, essential if either side is to get anything done. Something like that may come, but not from any spirit of bipartisanship. Rather there will be a vast scaling back of ambition. Gore's biggest programmes, on prescription drugs for the elderly for example, are bound to be dropped, one close aide told me yesterday. Bush's trillion-dollar tax cut is already history. Both men would have to appoint leading figures from the other side, creating a virtual government of national unity: we may not know who is going to be president, but Colin Powell is surely a cert for secretary of state under either man.</p> <p>On policy, it will be a case of little by little. Gore would push more slowly than planned to give all American children healthcare coverage. Bush would hesitate before naming any ultra- conservative judges to the supreme court. For the next president will face a task much larger than any agenda of his own: he will have to win the acceptance of a suspicious electorate and heal a divided nation.

But the long-term picture remains cloudy with some predicting prices will fall drastically as more and more discoveries appear, such as the offshore strike at Kashagan in Kazakhstan. One of the industry's most highly respected figures - former Saudi oil minister Sheikh Yamani - predicts crude will rapidly lose its value and the \"oil age\" will end within a few decades. This is partly because of finds in the Caspian, off West Africa and Brazil but mainly because of the development of new technology such as fuel cells which could take over from petrol to power cars. \"The stone age came to an end, not because we had a lack of stones, and the oil age will come to an end not because we have a lack of oil,\" Yamani, who in the 1970s helped alter the balance of world power, has said.

The surge in growth, expected to see the region expand by 5% this year, is being driven by high oil prices and by the currency devaluations following the Russian debt crisis in 1998, which have boosted competitiveness. But large areas are still facing poverty, unemployment and skill shortages, and the EBRD warned yesterday that the current robust economic performance cannot continue without structural reform. In its annual report on the progress made by the countries of central and eastern Europe, the Baltic states and the Commonwealth of Independent States in moving from central planning towards market economies, the bank argues that the benefits of reform have not been evenly distributed. It is concerned that, although the region is receiving a boost from the rise in the price of commodities like oil, one of its most precious resources - its \"human capital\" - is in danger of being frittered away. At the start of the transition process many countries of the former Soviet Union were expected to benefit from a combination of low labour costs and high eductional standards. But in a special analysis of labour markets in the region the EBRD says that, although there has been tremendous resilience in the face of dramatic change, the conventional wisdom is proving flawed. Although some workers have been able to take advantage of new opportunities, many others have been forced into the black economy and to talk up more than one job in order to make ends meet.

Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, will receive the Order of the Knight of the Grand Cross of St Michael and St George at Buckingham Palace. On Thursday he meets Tony Blair at Downing Street after lunch in his honour at the Cafe Royal. There will be talks with ministers including Stephen Byers, Geoff Hoon and Keith Vaz. He will hold discussions with defence contractor BAE Systems, and oil and gas companies BP, Shell and BG. Mr Nazabayev was named in a bribery case by the US justice department. An investigation is under way into the activities of James Giffen, a New York banker and adviser to Mr Nazarbayev. Mobil, Amoco and Phillips Petroleum are alleged to have passed \u00a325m to companies controlled by Mr Giffen which was then passed to the president. All parties deny impropriety but the story has inflamed passions in Kazakhstan and encouraged western media to accuse Mr Nazabayev of presiding over a kleptocracy. Mr Nazarbayev ran the Communist party in Kazakhstan when it was a Soviet republic. He took power in 1991 when the region elected to leave the USSR.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The country's oldest mutual insurer, Equitable Life, once regularly cited as an attractive takeover target for a hungry quoted rival, could yet be spurned on the marriage market. </p> <p>Only three months ago the insurer, which hung up a for sale sign after losing its lengthy legal battle over pension guarantees, claimed to have at least 12 potential suitors. The annuity affair visited a \u00a31.5bn-plus hole on its balance sheet, leaving Equitable no option but to find a partner if it wanted to keep up returns to the rest of its policyholders. </p> <p>Now, just days before the rumoured deadline for final offers from interested bidders, the crescendo in the City suggests just one party - Prudential - is still courting the mutual. </p> <p>Names such as CGNU, GE Capital, and Barclays Bank have come and gone. Even attempts earlier this week by pan-European insurer Eureko to throw together a last minute bid for Equitable are only being taken half seriously. </p> <p>If Prudential does turn out to be the last remaining suitor for Equitable, there is the prospect of a serious row: it is widely believed that the Pru's main motivation in chasing this damaged business is in order to put its so-called orphan assets to use, although its policy holders might have other ideas on what could be done with a total of around \u00a38bn of unclaimed money. </p> <p>While we are speculating (and it should be pointed out that the Pru has never publicly confirmed its interest), it is also worth asking what might happen to Equitable if the Pru were to pull out at this late stage. </p> <p>This is a business with 600,000 policy holders and 2,000 employees. No wonder, then, that investment bankers Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, handling the marriage arrangements, has already extended the deadline for interested parties once (to the end of this month) and could well extend it again. </p> <p>Chatter that Equitable might be broken up sounds idle, since it really only has a salesforce to hive off. But at the same time there have been rumours that the regulators may be forced to step in to orchestrate a forced marriage as the only alternative to Equitable closing its doors to new business and effectively \"running off\" its existing policies. </p> <p>None of this bodes well for Equitable's policy holders, many of whom have continued to dream of a traditional demutualisation windfall. </p> <p>In may prove to be the case that the financial black hole created by meeting promised guarantees is actually much bigger than many had assumed. </p> <p>Perhaps, coming up with a clever way to \"ring fence\" any losses may be one way to persuade bidders that the Equitable name - historically one of the cheapest providers in the industry - is worth preserving. Then again, too much reputational damage may have already been done. </p> <p><strong> Hole in ground </strong><br> </p> <p> Allegations of corruption and environmental destruction seem to follow the energy industry round like a cart behind a horse. Is this the true price of oil? </p> <p>Just like a British lottery winner, Kazakhstan is discovering there are two sides to a fairy story of untold wealth from black gold in the Caspian Sea. </p> <p>The oil majors are variously accused of being mixed up in bribery allegations concerning the president, killing off the seal population and destroying the fish that create the world's top supply of caviar. In turn, the Kazakh top man, Nursultan Nazarbayev, is alleged to be diverting oil revenues to his cronies and ignoring the plight of his impoverished countryfolk. </p> <p>Much of this is patently untrue, all remains unproven. But few people in either the east or west will give the oil majors any benefit of the doubt.

      "bodyText": "The country's oldest mutual insurer, Equitable Life, once regularly cited as an attractive takeover target for a hungry quoted rival, could yet be spurned on the marriage market. Only three months ago the insurer, which hung up a for sale sign after losing its lengthy legal battle over pension guarantees, claimed to have at least 12 potential suitors. The annuity affair visited a \u00a31.5bn-plus hole on its balance sheet, leaving Equitable no option but to find a partner if it wanted to keep up returns to the rest of its policyholders. Now, just days before the rumoured deadline for final offers from interested bidders, the crescendo in the City suggests just one party - Prudential - is still courting the mutual. Names such as CGNU, GE Capital, and Barclays Bank have come and gone. Even attempts earlier this week by pan-European insurer Eureko to throw together a last minute bid for Equitable are only being taken half seriously. If Prudential does turn out to be the last remaining suitor for Equitable, there is the prospect of a serious row: it is widely believed that the Pru's main motivation in chasing this damaged business is in order to put its so-called orphan assets to use, although its policy holders might have other ideas on what could be done with a total of around \u00a38bn of unclaimed money. While we are speculating (and it should be pointed out that the Pru has never publicly confirmed its interest), it is also worth asking what might happen to Equitable if the Pru were to pull out at this late stage. This is a business with 600,000 policy holders and 2,000 employees. No wonder, then, that investment bankers Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, handling the marriage arrangements, has already extended the deadline for interested parties once (to the end of this month) and could well extend it again. Chatter that Equitable might be broken up sounds idle, since it really only has a salesforce to hive off. But at the same time there have been rumours that the regulators may be forced to step in to orchestrate a forced marriage as the only alternative to Equitable closing its doors to new business and effectively \"running off\" its existing policies. None of this bodes well for Equitable's policy holders, many of whom have continued to dream of a traditional demutualisation windfall. In may prove to be the case that the financial black hole created by meeting promised guarantees is actually much bigger than many had assumed. Perhaps, coming up with a clever way to \"ring fence\" any losses may be one way to persuade bidders that the Equitable name - historically one of the cheapest providers in the industry - is worth preserving. Then again, too much reputational damage may have already been done. Hole in ground Allegations of corruption and environmental destruction seem to follow the energy industry round like a cart behind a horse. Is this the true price of oil? Just like a British lottery winner, Kazakhstan is discovering there are two sides to a fairy story of untold wealth from black gold in the Caspian Sea. The oil majors are variously accused of being mixed up in bribery allegations concerning the president, killing off the seal population and destroying the fish that create the world's top supply of caviar. In turn, the Kazakh top man, Nursultan Nazarbayev, is alleged to be diverting oil revenues to his cronies and ignoring the plight of his impoverished countryfolk. Much of this is patently untrue, all remains unproven. But few people in either the east or west will give the oil majors any benefit of the doubt. Critics say their track record puts them on a par with the defence sector when it comes to unsavoury practices. Which is a pity, since although BP has had its problems in Colombia and Shell its issues in both Nigeria and the North Sea with Brent Spar, both have been working hard over recent years to prove they are good corporate citizens. Indeed these top oil majors, which helped make the Kashagan oil strike in the Caspian, have been at the forefront of efforts in Kazakhstan to introduce a sustainable social programme that already is benefiting local people. The potential tragedy of all this revolves around the sky-high expectations being raised by Kazakh government officials. Only one well has been drilled on Kashagan and no one can possible say at this juncture exactly how much crude lies under the sea. For Mr Nazarbayev to suggest that Kazakhstan is on the brink of becoming the next Saudi Arabia is foolhardy to say the least. If the oil majors eventually discover they are sitting on 6bn barrels of crude, not 60bn, we all know who the scapegoats will be. And it will not be the president.",

      "bodyText": "Bautino in Kazakhstan seems to be perched on the edge of the world. Separated from London by a distance of more than 3,000 miles the tiny, crumbling town can only be reached via three flights and a drive of two hours in sub-zero temperatures. These days the town clings to the shores of its only remaining lifeline - the Caspian Sea. In its heyday, Bautino - whose population is fewer than 4,000 - was a bustling fishing port providing a welcome rest for travellers on the Silk Road between China and Turkey. Now rusted trawler hulks litter the harbour, a fish canning factory lies abandoned and amphibious landing craft - formerly the pride of the Red Army - lie disintegrating in what remains of their assembly yard. The petrol station closed seven years ago, and little moves in Bautino because the fuel has run out. But all this is about to change, for Kazakhstan appears to be on the brink of a \"black gold\" rush. Oil, which has trickled around the region since the days of Marco Polo, could flood Kazakhstan's empty state coffers. There are glimpses of this new world in a tiny enclave at the edge of the town. Behind a high chainlink fence and stiff security, oil men from as far afield as Cardiff and Rotterdam, Texas and Milan tuck into steak au poivre and an assortment of sweets.

We finish our pints and follow him out, for we too are going to the theatre. </p> <p>Attending matinees makes me feel guilty that I am not working but also virtuous because I am not watching TV. Actors are also ambivalent about them. They hate doing them and yet a disproportionate number of theatrical anecdotes seem to involve high jinks during an afternoon performance. Here's one: an actor noted for his drinking wakes up in the early evening with a hangover and realises he's missed the matinee. He rushes to the theatre and says he's sorry. The company manager replies, \"I should think you are. That was the worst performance I've ever seen.\" </p> <p>In actorly legend matinees are sparsely attended by mad old ladies and schoolchildren who fart and eat crisps. This wasn't the case at Stones in His Pockets, at the Duke of York's. It was almost sold out and the teenagers present were well behaved to the point of primness. Admittedly most of the audience were getting on a bit, but so what? So am I. </p> <p>Harry, who has written plays, believes that Irish playwrights have an advantage over other dramatists. They have a history rich in war and persecution; they have the theme of the longing to escape (usually to America) and the desire to stay (usually in a village with a made-up name). If the play's flagging you can stick in a bit of rousing Riverdance stuff. Always on tap is that delicious Irish \"nostalgie de la peat\". Stones in His Pockets had all these elements and more. I loved it. </p> <p>Harry agreed that it was well-written and beautifully acted, but this did not prevent him from staying in the pub during the second half. He could not endure another hour without a cigarette. It is dark when I rejoin him. We drink more Guinness. I go home and put the Pogues on. Another afternoon dispatched.</p>",

      "bodyText": "So Harry and I are hunched in the gloomy afternoon light of a pub in the West End. The only other drinker is an enormously old man who sits alone, a cigarette unicorned to his head. When he shuffles painfully out of the bar, Harry conjectures that he is off to play the detective in The Mousetrap. We finish our pints and follow him out, for we too are going to the theatre. Attending matinees makes me feel guilty that I am not working but also virtuous because I am not watching TV. Actors are also ambivalent about them. They hate doing them and yet a disproportionate number of theatrical anecdotes seem to involve high jinks during an afternoon performance. Here's one: an actor noted for his drinking wakes up in the early evening with a hangover and realises he's missed the matinee. He rushes to the theatre and says he's sorry. The company manager replies, \"I should think you are. That was the worst performance I've ever seen.\" In actorly legend matinees are sparsely attended by mad old ladies and schoolchildren who fart and eat crisps. This wasn't the case at Stones in His Pockets, at the Duke of York's. It was almost sold out and the teenagers present were well behaved to the point of primness. Admittedly most of the audience were getting on a bit, but so what? So am I. Harry, who has written plays, believes that Irish playwrights have an advantage over other dramatists. They have a history rich in war and persecution; they have the theme of the longing to escape (usually to America) and the desire to stay (usually in a village with a made-up name). If the play's flagging you can stick in a bit of rousing Riverdance stuff. Always on tap is that delicious Irish \"nostalgie de la peat\". Stones in His Pockets had all these elements and more. I loved it. Harry agreed that it was well-written and beautifully acted, but this did not prevent him from staying in the pub during the second half. He could not endure another hour without a cigarette. It is dark when I rejoin him. We drink more Guinness. I go home and put the Pogues on. Another afternoon dispatched.",

Almost overnight Jan Vermeer became what he is today, one of the most revered painters in the world. What had changed? The answer is the invention of the photograph. </p> <p>It was only when people compared Vermeer's silent interiors to photographs that they were enraptured by him, by that woman holding a jug, letting a white stream of milk pour into a brown bowl.

By the 1890s haystacks would be fit matter for painting. Monet's paintings of haystacks are not allegories; they are just studies of light falling on these objects in the fields. The photograph gave art a new love of the ordinariness of ordinary things. Yet photography itself remained a despised, suspiciously technical newcomer among the arts. </p> <p>This is especially true in Britain where something went sadly wrong at the end of the 19th century. The photograph was a product of Victorian scientific curiosity, but just as the energy of 19th-century architecture and engineering gave way in Britain to a timid anti-modernism after the first world war, so did the Victorian passion for photography. </p> <p>Britain, the first country to take the photograph seriously, now gives it the shortest shrift in its national art museums. There is no central, authoritative public photography collection in Britain. Instead the Royal Photographic Society in Bath, founded in 1853 and one of the oldest collections in the world, with spectacular holdings of 19th-century greats such as Fox Talbot and Julia Margaret Cameron, is fighting to maintain its priceless prints, negatives and other materials. </p> <p>\"We have a very important national photography collection which is held by a private institution and with the best will in the world we can't put enough money in it to behave like a national collection at the moment,\" says its curator Pam Roberts. </p> <p>In the absence of national public support the collection, which is funded by the membership of the RPS, is currently pursuing a lottery partnership grant with the Wiltshire public records office. If this is awarded the RPS will move to a new building in Devizes, a fairly remote location for a national centre for photography. The RPS say they have to move to a modern building better equipped than their current 18th-century home. \"This is not about a beleaguered society,\" insists the company secretary, Barry Lane. Nevertheless, its exhibition gallery in Bath will close when the current show Photogenic, a survey of the entire collection, ends. </p> <p>The Victoria and Albert Museum has collected photographs since 1856, but does not present them in relation to high art. When the V&amp;A opened the Canon Photography Gallery in 1998, it published a book championing photography as \"An Independent Art\", a modest claim for a medium that has revolutionised human consciousness. And in Bradford there is the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, established in 1983. \"Between us we have better collections than anywhere,\" insists Lane. But what we do not have is the institutional weight that can only be given to photography by displaying it in a national art museum. </p> <p> This is because photography in Britain has never played the game of defining itself as an art. In the 19th century this was not a problem; early photographers made no distinction between aesthetic and practical uses of their medium. The RPS was founded \"to promote the art and science of photography\". Yet in the 20th century those who championed photographs as high art have striven to separate the \"art photograph\" from the snapshot and photojournalism. \"There are two distinct roads in photography - the utilitarian and the aesthetic,\" wrote the American critic Charles Caffin in Photography as a Fine Art in 1901, \"the goal of the one being a record of facts, and the other an expression of beauty.\" </p> <p>What alarms us about photography is its universality. To define a photograph as art is to democratise the very idea of art. Tate Modern, for the first time in Britain, incorporates photographic images in a systematic way in its displays. But the criteria which make one photograph suitable for Tate Modern and consign another to an archive are as elitist today as they were in the early 20th century. </p> <p>The story was different in the US, where the photographer and artist Alfred Stieglitz saved photography for art by separating it from function. Since the 1980s postmodern theory has saved photography for art by denying that light registering on sensitised paper has any authenticity. </p> <p>This should be fun, but lately has given rise to some astonishingly bad art. When Cindy Sherman made her first Untitled Film Stills in the late 1970s there was real excitement. She could change her face, become a girl in a thriller, a victim in a horror film. Today, this use of the camera is academic; it is a cliche to think that the camera always lies. Artists assume the camera is a tool to make images rather than find them. This is the photographic art that is promoted by art galleries today, art that is recognised as art because it is about ideas. </p> <p>\"What most artists using photography feel that they need to do is to show that they are serious, that they are not taking snapshots,\" says Wolfgang Tillmans. \"To point a camera at something does not qualify you as an artist because everybody has done that.\" Tillmans's photographs have been nominated for the Turner prize. If he wins, he will be the first photographer to do so. If he doesn't, it will be because his work looks too much like mere photography. </p> <p>In the National Gallery there is a painting by Georges Seurat of an expanse of nothingness at the edge of a community, recorded without emotional inflection. Seurat's Channel at Gravelines (1890) is a painting that could not have been conceived before photography. We could not enjoy a painting like this, could not even see it as art, without unconsciously thinking of photography; Seurat could not have painted it without the example of photography. </p> <p>Yet the National Gallery, like the Tate until recently, has never talked about photography in the same breath as painting. In New York's Metropolitan Museum you can stroll from the painting galleries to take in an exhibition of photographs; at the Museum of Modern Art you can look at the work of Walker Evans, Garry Winogrand or William Eggleston alongside paintings by Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol, and see for yourself how it all adds up.

      "body": "<p>When he left the Royal Court in 1993 there were many who thought Max Stafford-Clark would never again be a major player in British theatre. He had been at the Court for 14 years, and his undignified and unwilling departure suggested that he had become institutionalised. What the doubters underestimated was just how shrewd an operator Stafford-Clark is, and how capable of creating his own luck. Within a year he was making the news, this time for the right reasons. </p> <p>Stafford-Clark had founded that rarest of things: a highly successful touring theatre company specialising in new work. Out of Joint's most famous production - Mark Ravenhill's Shopping and Fucking, with its mix of hardcore sex and takeaways - made theatre suddenly seem upfront and essential; and its premiere of Caryl Churchill's Blue Heart paved the way for the theatrical obsession with the unreliability of language. </p> <p>Stafford-Clark's latest production for Out of Joint is a double bill that you might call a state-of-the-nation evening, if that didn't make it sound old-fashioned. It certainly reflects the fact that words like \"socialism\" and \"working-class\" have disappeared from New Labour's vocabulary, while phrases such as \"underclass\" now fall from Tony Blair's lips. </p> <p>The evening comprises a revival of Andrea Dunbar's brutally funny account of life on a Bradford housing estate, Rita, Sue and Bob Too, which Stafford-Clark first directed at the Royal Court almost 20 years ago. He has paired it with a new play, A State Affair, that revisits Dunbar's Bradford and deprived estates in other parts of Britain and makes vital, living theatre out of the verbatim testimony of those living there and trying to survive the consequences of drug addiction, child abuse, domestic violence and lack of hope. This is an infinitely more shocking evening than Shopping and Fucking. </p> <p>Stafford-Clark makes no apologies for putting it in front of our noses or the fact that these two plays will, like most theatre, almost inevitably play to the well-heeled. </p> <p>\"I like the middle class,\" he declares. \"Without the middle class there would be no theatre. They are the movers and shakers, the people who get things done. They are the people who need to be acquainted with this world and understand it. I've no problem with the fact that theatre plays to the intelligentsia. The first audience I seek to engage is my peer group. Sometimes what you do becomes a popular success. But you can't aim at it. All you can aim to do is please yourself.\" </p> <p>If this double bill were broadcast on TV it would provoke a national debate. The fact that it appears in the theatre means it will probably pass almost unnoticed. But its very existence points to Stafford-Clark's greatest gift and the reason for his longevity - an ability to sniff the zeitgeist and turn it into theatre. Unlike many directors of new writing - and indeed many critics - his taste has not become fixed at some date in the past when he was in his prime. It is constantly being moved on by an inquisitiveness about the world and about other worlds. It is why, with 60 staring him in the face, he is still a credible champion of new writing and not just a silly old has-been trying to be young and trendy. </p> <p>\"I am very much aware that I will be 60 next year, but I am not sure that it matters if you are engaged with the world. Just as I can explore the other world of a Bradford housing estate through these plays, so I can approach the world of youth in a similar way. If I were simply defined by the world I knew, I would only do plays by middle-class doctors' sons, which I suppose would qualify me for Chekhov and not much else. A writer's life can be brutally short because they deal with first-hand experience. But a director's life is longer because we are collaborative artists and work off the inspiration of others. If you are open to it, you could go on for ever.\" </p> <p>Stafford-Clark has been at it for over 30 years, first making his mark at Edinburgh's Traverse theatre then co-founding the political theatre collective Joint Stock in 1974. That lead to his appointment to the Royal Court in 1979. I remember him there during the mid-80s, his glossy moustache and long hair giving him the look of a neurotic King Charles Spaniel. There was a lurking sense of paranoia evident in the sorrowful, tear-stained letters that he would send to you if he thought you had given one of his productions less than its due, and in the annual critics' Christmas lunch in which he would take his revenge by making critics play unwinnable party games that demonstrated just how hard it was to run the Court. </p> <p>Looking back, Stafford-Clark probably had justification for his paranoia. There is now plenty of evidence that during the Thatcher years there were many who would have liked to have seen the demise of the Royal Court. Of course Stafford-Clark made mistakes, most notably over deciding to stage Jim Allen's anti-Zionist play Perdition and then abandoning it; but if you take his predecessor Bill Gaskill's maxim that the first task of the Court's artistic director is to survive, and the second is not to miss the best play of the decade, then Stafford-Clark did pretty well in an era of increasing opposition and diminishing funding. In a decade that didn't throw up too many gems he championed the cause of women playwrights and nurtured two major talents in Caryl Churchill and Timberlake Wertenbaker. If the Court was sometimes an unhappy ship during his time there, full of rumour and intrigue, that is perhaps the nature of the organisation: his successors Stephen Daldry and Ian Rickson have fared no better. </p> <p>Stafford-Clark can evaluate his time at the Court more dispassionately these days. \"I was managing a retreat at the Court during the 80s, and it is never so glorious conducting an army in retreat than an army in advance. I did stay too long because I didn't have the imagination to leave. But when I did leave I didn't have one moment's nostalgia, and I'm proud I left the Court with the \u00a3350,000 surplus that funded the work Stephen Daldry used to expand. He had the personality for expansion - I didn't.\" </p> <p>Stafford-Clark retains a connection with the Court and regularly attends script meetings, but his energies are with Out of Joint, the company that has given him a new lease of life. \"One of the things I love about Out of Joint is that because we only do two or three productions you need only do plays that you are really passionate about, not the ones that aren't at the centre of your taste but that you think you ought to do. That's freedom.\" </p> <p>But surely he must miss running a building? \"Only in very fleeting moments. I did visit a regional theatre in a mess a while back and just for a moment thought 'Wouldn't it be exciting_?', but it was only a moment. I can't imagine circumstances in which I would leave Out of Joint, but of course_,\" he pauses, his eyes twinkling. \"What can you do if the nation calls you?\" The room rings with his laughter. The old Stafford-Clark would never have been able to send himself up like that. </p> <p>\u0095 Rita, Sue and Bob Too and A State Affair are at the Mercury, Colchester (01206 573948), until Saturday, then tour to Eastbourne, Plymouth and the Soho Theatre, London WC2 (020-7478 0100).</p>",

Looking back, Stafford-Clark probably had justification for his paranoia. There is now plenty of evidence that during the Thatcher years there were many who would have liked to have seen the demise of the Royal Court. Of course Stafford-Clark made mistakes, most notably over deciding to stage Jim Allen's anti-Zionist play Perdition and then abandoning it; but if you take his predecessor Bill Gaskill's maxim that the first task of the Court's artistic director is to survive, and the second is not to miss the best play of the decade, then Stafford-Clark did pretty well in an era of increasing opposition and diminishing funding. In a decade that didn't throw up too many gems he championed the cause of women playwrights and nurtured two major talents in Caryl Churchill and Timberlake Wertenbaker. If the Court was sometimes an unhappy ship during his time there, full of rumour and intrigue, that is perhaps the nature of the organisation: his successors Stephen Daldry and Ian Rickson have fared no better. Stafford-Clark can evaluate his time at the Court more dispassionately these days. \"I was managing a retreat at the Court during the 80s, and it is never so glorious conducting an army in retreat than an army in advance. I did stay too long because I didn't have the imagination to leave. But when I did leave I didn't have one moment's nostalgia, and I'm proud I left the Court with the \u00a3350,000 surplus that funded the work Stephen Daldry used to expand. He had the personality for expansion - I didn't.\" Stafford-Clark retains a connection with the Court and regularly attends script meetings, but his energies are with Out of Joint, the company that has given him a new lease of life. \"One of the things I love about Out of Joint is that because we only do two or three productions you need only do plays that you are really passionate about, not the ones that aren't at the centre of your taste but that you think you ought to do. That's freedom.\" But surely he must miss running a building? \"Only in very fleeting moments. I did visit a regional theatre in a mess a while back and just for a moment thought 'Wouldn't it be exciting_?', but it was only a moment. I can't imagine circumstances in which I would leave Out of Joint, but of course_,\" he pauses, his eyes twinkling. \"What can you do if the nation calls you?\" The room rings with his laughter. The old Stafford-Clark would never have been able to send himself up like that. \u0095 Rita, Sue and Bob Too and A State Affair are at the Mercury, Colchester (01206 573948), until Saturday, then tour to Eastbourne, Plymouth and the Soho Theatre, London WC2 (020-7478 0100).",

A team of seven UN security council representatives, including Britain's deputy permanent representative, Stewart Eldon, said during a visit to Timor that no action would be taken against Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid, for failing to comply with the council's resolution ordering a rapid conclusion to the refugee crisis. The mission's leader, Namibia's UN representative, Martin Andjaba, said just before leaving independent East Timor for Indonesian West Timor that he was \"not here to punish Indonesia or to recommend to the security council to call for punishment\". \"Our mission is not to destabilise,\" he said. \"We do not want any confrontations. We want cooperation with the Indonesian authorities so everything can be done to address the issue of the refugees and bring them back to East Timor.\" More than 170,000 refugees have already returned home but the flow of repatriation has practically dried up since after all international and the majority of local agencies pulled out of the region following the murder of three UN refugee agency staff in the West Timor border town of Atambua on September 6. They were killed by a mob of pro-Jakarta East Timorese militia who, backed by elements of the Indonesian army, had been terrorising the refugees and the humanitarian workers since their arrival in September 1999 to help resolve the crisis. The security council immediately passed a resolution calling for the disarming and disbanding of the militias, the prosecution of the murderers, the restoration of law and order, and a greater effort to help repatriate those refugees who want to return to East Timor. Jakarta immediately deployed more than 5,000 troops and police to West Timor and, in a grand public display, began searching for weapons. More than 90 automatic rifles and hundreds of homemade guns were seized and several people were arrested in connection with the murders. The UN representatives are in Timor to assess progress and to gauge the best way forward. The team is due to visit Atambua today, but it is unlikely to get a true picture of events; the trip is being carefully stage-managed. More than 1,000 soldiers have been deployed in the town. They have already heard first-hand from newly returned refugees to East Timor that the reality in West Timor is that the militias and some military units are still terrorising the refugees, preventing them from making a free choice about whether to return to East Timor. It is also clear that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other international agencies would face enormous hostility from the militias if they tried to restart humanitarian assistance and repatriation programmes in West Timor. One UN source in East Timor said: \"Everyone here in East Timor recognises that it's in no one's interests, least of all the refugees, to rock the fragile political position of President Wahid in Jakarta.\" President Wahid is under increasing pressure to resign. The crisis in West Timor is just one of several battles he is fighting. Rapidly escalating separatist conflicts in Aceh and Papua, two financial scandals, his failure to end the country's prolonged economic turmoil and the government's inability to find the fugitive son of the former dictator, Suharto, are also being used as ammunition by his critics. However, the international community regards Mr Wahid as the safest presidential candidate, according to the UN source. \"The worry is that if Mr Wahid is forced out,\" he said, \"Indonesia could very well descend into long-term political instability that might pave the way for a military takeover.\"",

The nationalities of four other victims who have been officially identified is not known. Safety experts yesterday intensified their criticism that certain basic safety measures were lacking on the railway, which was built in 1974. It has been confirmed that there were only two fire extinguishers, situated in the driver's cabin and only operable by a trained person. Neither the train nor tunnel had a sprinkler system, which could have dampened the blaze. The doors were controlled by the driver, and manual or mechanical opening was only possible outside the train. The tunnel had no emergency exits, only a horizontal passageway at the middle-station where workers could enter to carry out repairs. The Austrian transport ministry and Gletscher Bahnen AG, the railway owner, also confirmed that no fire drill had ever taken place in the tunnel. \"The idea that a fire could break out in the tunnel was considered to be something unimaginable,\" said Peter Pr\u00e4auer, the train firm's commercial director. As to the absence of sprinklers, largely inaccessible fire extinguishers and other safety shortcomings, Mr Pr\u00e4auer said: \"That wasn't legally required by the authorities, even if one says in hindsight that that was a mistake.\" Meanwhile, families of some victims from Bavaria in Germany have launched a lawsuit against the railway owner, claiming criminal liability. While officials at Austrian ski resorts continued safety checks on similar railways, the French transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, ordered the immediate inspection of three glacier trains in France. There have been calls in Austria for tougher fire protection regulations for ski clothing, after experts confirmed that synthetic clothing worn by the passengers, along with lacquered plastic snow-boards, skis and boots, almost certainly added to the rapidity with which the fire took hold. \"The outfit and snowboard of just a single person would have the same burning capacity as 30 litres of heating oil,\" a fire expert told Austrian television. Last night, psychologists in Kaprun and Salzburg said they were trying to dissuade families who wanted to see the remains of their relatives. \"We're been trying to gently convey to them that it would be quite terrible to see the remains, when in nearly all cases there's almost nothing left,\" said Bernhard Hittenberger, chief of Salzburg social services.",

      "body": "<p>Ultimately, the battle being fought out in the Florida courts yesterday is neither a technical dispute about election law nor proof that America is in near-terminal constitutional crisis. But it is the latest combat in the culture wars that define the modern United States.</p> <p>When Americans went to the polls last week, they split the country. The presidential election ended in the continuing 48%-48% shootout between Al Gore and George W Bush. The new House of Representatives is divided 221-212, which in the fluid world of US party loyalties is tantamount to a tie. The Senate might still end up with 50 Republican seats and 50 Democrat.</p> <p>\"Never in our history have we ever had a partisan balance across the country as even as this,\" says Norman Ornstein, a political scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.</p> <p>Yet the stand-off in last week's election results reflects something deeper and wider about America. The intense dislike of the Bush and Gore camps for one another - fully on view in Florida once more yesterday - is not merely the mistrust of two groups of exhausted partisans at the end of a hard-fought campaign. It is the mutual incomprehension of two Americas which are finding it increasingly difficult to live as neighbours.</p> <p>To some observers, including many foreigners, the US election was a battle between two barely distinguishable dynastic centrists. But that is a fundamental misreading. Mr Bush and Mr Gore are, in fact, the standard bearers and embodiments - imperfect and improbable though they are - of two deeply different alliances of Americans.</p> <p>Mr Bush speaks for culturally conservative America. He speaks for most men, for a majority of whites, for the rural heartlands, for moral conservatives, for the military, for angry guys and for country and western music.</p> <p>Mr Gore speaks for most women, for black Americans and the other racial minorities, for cities, for moral liberals, for dissenters, for taking a relaxed view and for rock and roll.</p> <p>Both sides intensely believe that they speak for the majority. Mr Bush's forces believe that the eight years of Democratic rule in the White House are a historical aberration and that the natural order is about to be re-established. That goes a long way to explain the Bush campaign's over-confidence during the closing days of the election campaign and its eagerness to parade itself as the presidential team in waiting ever since November 7.</p> <p>The Gore campaign, by contrast, comes from the generation of \"new\" Democrats that believes its party has remade itself as the voice of a new middle-class majority - a third-way party open to the centre, not a party resting forever on the class-based pillars of yesteryear.</p> <p>But the two groups suffer from the same delusion: both believe they are the majority. They are both wrong. As last week's results so powerfully showed, each represents only half of the nation.</p> <p>This is not primarily a division between social and economic classes, although the Republicans remain the party of the richest Americans and the Democrats are still the party of the poorest. It is a fluid moral and cultural divide, with many cross-currents. Inevitably, less than two years after the event, it is a divide that vividly recreates the fault lines of the Clinton impeachment crisis of 1998-99.</p> <p>That event, so widely seen as mere entertainment by the rest of the world, was always treated more seriously by Americans. In the light of last week's elections, it may even be right to call it the defining cultural event of today's United States.</p> <p>Though the stakes could hardly be higher in the current Florida disputes over election ballot counts, the sheer animus of the two sides can be fully understood only as an attempt by one side to purge America of the Clinton culture, and by the other to die in the last ditch rather than surrender to the party of Kenneth Starr, the special counsel whose investigations led to the impeachment of the president.</p> <p>That is why the aftermath may be so difficult, whichever side wins. Washington today is full of talk about the need for \"reaching out across the divide\", for bringing the nation together, even - in the op-ed columns of commentators such as Joe Klein and Thomas Friedman - for coalition government.</p> <p>Talk of a Gore administration featuring the Republican likes of Colin Powell, or of a Bush administration with a place for Richard Holbrooke, may appeal to Washington power brokers. But it is at odds with the mood of the country. America's sense of itself as one nation is one of its greatest strengths. But it is currently being put to a test it has not faced at any time since the Vietnam war.</p> <p>The mood of the coming months will be dominated not by reconciliation but by the desire for revenge.</p>",

But it is the latest combat in the culture wars that define the modern United States. When Americans went to the polls last week, they split the country. The presidential election ended in the continuing 48%-48% shootout between Al Gore and George W Bush. The new House of Representatives is divided 221-212, which in the fluid world of US party loyalties is tantamount to a tie. The Senate might still end up with 50 Republican seats and 50 Democrat. \"Never in our history have we ever had a partisan balance across the country as even as this,\" says Norman Ornstein, a political scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Yet the stand-off in last week's election results reflects something deeper and wider about America. The intense dislike of the Bush and Gore camps for one another - fully on view in Florida once more yesterday - is not merely the mistrust of two groups of exhausted partisans at the end of a hard-fought campaign. It is the mutual incomprehension of two Americas which are finding it increasingly difficult to live as neighbours. To some observers, including many foreigners, the US election was a battle between two barely distinguishable dynastic centrists. But that is a fundamental misreading. Mr Bush and Mr Gore are, in fact, the standard bearers and embodiments - imperfect and improbable though they are - of two deeply different alliances of Americans. Mr Bush speaks for culturally conservative America. He speaks for most men, for a majority of whites, for the rural heartlands, for moral conservatives, for the military, for angry guys and for country and western music. Mr Gore speaks for most women, for black Americans and the other racial minorities, for cities, for moral liberals, for dissenters, for taking a relaxed view and for rock and roll. Both sides intensely believe that they speak for the majority. Mr Bush's forces believe that the eight years of Democratic rule in the White House are a historical aberration and that the natural order is about to be re-established. That goes a long way to explain the Bush campaign's over-confidence during the closing days of the election campaign and its eagerness to parade itself as the presidential team in waiting ever since November 7. The Gore campaign, by contrast, comes from the generation of \"new\" Democrats that believes its party has remade itself as the voice of a new middle-class majority - a third-way party open to the centre, not a party resting forever on the class-based pillars of yesteryear. But the two groups suffer from the same delusion: both believe they are the majority. They are both wrong. As last week's results so powerfully showed, each represents only half of the nation. This is not primarily a division between social and economic classes, although the Republicans remain the party of the richest Americans and the Democrats are still the party of the poorest. It is a fluid moral and cultural divide, with many cross-currents. Inevitably, less than two years after the event, it is a divide that vividly recreates the fault lines of the Clinton impeachment crisis of 1998-99. That event, so widely seen as mere entertainment by the rest of the world, was always treated more seriously by Americans. In the light of last week's elections, it may even be right to call it the defining cultural event of today's United States. Though the stakes could hardly be higher in the current Florida disputes over election ballot counts, the sheer animus of the two sides can be fully understood only as an attempt by one side to purge America of the Clinton culture, and by the other to die in the last ditch rather than surrender to the party of Kenneth Starr, the special counsel whose investigations led to the impeachment of the president. That is why the aftermath may be so difficult, whichever side wins. Washington today is full of talk about the need for \"reaching out across the divide\", for bringing the nation together, even - in the op-ed columns of commentators such as Joe Klein and Thomas Friedman - for coalition government. Talk of a Gore administration featuring the Republican likes of Colin Powell, or of a Bush administration with a place for Richard Holbrooke, may appeal to Washington power brokers. But it is at odds with the mood of the country. America's sense of itself as one nation is one of its greatest strengths. But it is currently being put to a test it has not faced at any time since the Vietnam war. The mood of the coming months will be dominated not by reconciliation but by the desire for revenge.",

Israel's deputy prime minister, Binyamin Ben Eliezer, called it the Palestinians' \"death-by-road\" campaign yesterday.</p> <p>New barricades were erected or fortified throughout the West Bank, squeezing shut the ring of steel imposed on Palestinian towns since the conflict began seven weeks ago.</p> <p>Israel's army chief, Shaul Mofaz, admitted yesterday that the West Bank could not be hermetically sealed.

      "bodyText": "Israeli troops rolled out barricades of concrete blocks and spiked metal strips across the West Bank yesterday, opening battle with the Palestinians for control of vital roadways. A day after four Jews were killed in drive-by shootings, Israel fears its high-security routes could become a killing zone for troops and Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel's deputy prime minister, Binyamin Ben Eliezer, called it the Palestinians' \"death-by-road\" campaign yesterday. New barricades were erected or fortified throughout the West Bank, squeezing shut the ring of steel imposed on Palestinian towns since the conflict began seven weeks ago. Israel's army chief, Shaul Mofaz, admitted yesterday that the West Bank could not be hermetically sealed. Instead, the closure is designed to cripple the Palestinian economy, and there could be further pain if the army acts on a proposal for a partial curfew on cars with Palestinian number plates. Four Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli soldiers yesterday, an almost routine casualty rate during these weeks of bloodshed. But today could bring a steep rise in violence. The Palestinians are poised to confront the closure after Yasser Arafat's Fatah organisation urged the people to throw Israeli soldiers and settlers out of the West Bank on the 12th anniversary of a symbolic declaration of independence. \"Fatah calls on the people to prevent the occupation forces and the herds of settlers from entering Palestinian areas,\" a statement, published yesterday in Palestinian newspapers, said. \"The day will be a day of challenge between the will of the people and the will of the heavily armed occupation.\" In Neguhot, a hardline settlement west of Hebron hunkered down with Israeli soldiers behind barbed wire and electric yellow gates, 13 Jewish families have been penned in by local Palestinian hostility for months. Earlier this year, a two-and-a-half mile stretch of the main road to the settlement was transferred to full Palestinian control, under the now comatose peace process. When the violence erupted seven weeks ago, the road, already a risky route for the settlers because of sporadic stone-throwing, became off limits. From this hilltop at 770 metres, the settlers can see the twinkling lights of Tel Aviv. But if they want to travel to the nearest Jewish settlements a few miles away, they must follow a circuitous route that takes nearly two hours. \"The problem with the road is that the army does not rule there. It is in Palestinian hands, and the army says if we pass through there we could get shot,\" said Neguhot's secretary, Yigael Leibner. A former army lieutenant, Mr Leibner was one of the founding settlers of Neguhot some three years ago, and he fervently believes the outposts manned by some 200,000 Jews in the West Bank and Gaza are vital to Israel's interests. \"Where there are settlements, there is security,\" he said. \"The army puts more into it, and the settlers help keep the roads going.\" That is not how they are seen by the Palestinians, who consider the settlements a symbol of the occupation; nor is that the interpretation from Israeli liberals, who believe they remain the greatest obstacle to peace. On Monday, the Israeli movement, Peace Now, launched a high-profile campaign, calling on the prime minister, Ehud Barak, to stop the expansion of West Bank settlements. \"The building of settlements and the opening of roads leading to them is a provocative act calling unnecessarily for counter-violence,\" Peace Now said. Many settlers see their presence in the West Bank as a biblical birthright; those who oppose them have drifted from the true Zionist mission. Mr Leibner believes that the Palestinians should go - and their emigration be encouraged - and that the settlers should tough it out. \"Every Arab attack should be answered by a new Jewish settlement coming up, another Jewish house, and another Jewish kid,\" he said. \"I do not think we can win this fight. The long-range solution is not the army, it is to put our feet deeper into the land.\"",

      "bodyText": "Florida's controversial secretary of state, Katherine Harris, emerged yesterday as the official with the potential power to determine who wins the US presidential election, after a court ordered her to use her \"discretion\" in accepting late manual recounts in the tightly contested state. In an anxiously awaited verdict in the state capital, Tallahassee, Judge Terry Lewis upheld a deadline laid down by Ms Harris, a Republican activist, for all the state's 67 counties to certify their final tallies by 5pm local time yesterday. However, in a two pronged ruling, Judge Lewis - a novelist in his spare time who once wrote a legal thriller called Conflict of Interest - said Ms Harris must consider late results arising from hand counts demanded by the Democrats in four counties. She would have the power to reject those results but could not do so \"arbitrarily\" and would have to exercise \"sound discretion\". Democrats were quick to seize the political initiative in the wake of the ruling. Warren Christopher, Mr Gore's troubleshooter in Florida, said: \"Under this decision we now have a vehicle for the full, fair and accurate tabulation of the votes of the citizens of Florida.\" Standing at his side David Boies, a high-powered Democratic lawyer, warned: \"If the secretary of state refuses to accept amended returns based on the recount and violates what the court rules is her duty then we may be back in court.\" In a state where George W Bush has a lead of only 338 votes in preliminary results, Ms Harris's \"discretion\" over the manual recount could decide who moves into the White House on January 20. Democrats have pointed out that she campaigned actively for Mr Bush and was appointed by his brother, Jeb, the governor of Florida. A spokeswoman for Ms Harris said she would listen to reasons for late results \"based on what the counties tell her\" but she emphasised the legal weight of the 5pm deadline. As the large, mainly Democratic counties of Miami-Dade and Palm Beach had not even begun a manual recount of votes by the time of the ruling, Ms Harris's 5pm ruling would have the effect of locking in Mr Bush's narrow lead in Florida, the state which is almost certain to decide the presidency. In that case, Mr Bush's lead in Florida could only be threatened by absentee ballots by Floridians living abroad, such as the armed services and Jewish Americans living in Israel, whose votes have to be counted by midnight on Friday. Absentee ballots have historically tended to favour Republicans. Local lawsuits continued to blossom in Florida out of the detritus of the presidential elections. The two sides fought out a number of simultaneous legal skirmishes in the four counties, Palm Beach, Volusia, Broward and Miami-Dade. In Volusia county, which brought the original case against Ms Harris for an extension of the deadline, officials said they might have problems in completing their 200,000 vote count by 5pm. In Palm Beach county, meanwhile officials halted plans to begin a full manual recount of more than 400,000 votes. In Miami-Dade county, officials agreed late yesterday morning to begin a partial recount in three precincts. A hearing about what should be done in a fourth county, Broward, was due to begin late yesterday.

      "body": "<p>His recent heart attack will keep Henry Kissinger away from St John's, Smith Square, London this morning, where John Aspinall's memorial service begins at 11, but Chief Buthelezi will be there; so, too, will be Goldsmiths and Birleys, young and old, as well as an assortment of plutocrats and intellectuals, decaying roues and dispossessed aristocrats.</p> <p>Aspinall, who died last June, now lies in the lime avenue at Howletts in Kent, between two graves, one for Mameena, his daughter by his second wife; the other for one of his favourite gorillas. Like Port Lympne, his other magnificent house in Kent, Howletts is home to a zoo of world renown. The zoos are funded by a charitable trust which Aspinall endowed with \u00a318.5m - a remarkable legacy for a man who inherited no money, and who, in 74 years, never endured a single day in conventional employment.</p> <p>It was made possible, of course, by the success of his casinos; more precisely, by the rich who lost their fortunes in them. Aspinall was never squeamish about this. He once reflected that his first casino, the Clermont, whose founder members included five dukes, five marquesses and 20 earls, was a place \"where gentlemen could ruin themselves as elegantly and suicidally as did their ancestors 300 years ago\". Aspinall was true to his word. It was routinely said that, until the crisis at Lloyd's insurance market, he was responsible for the greatest redistribution of upper-class wealth of the 20th century.</p> <p>He set to work in the late 50s, holding gaming parties in Mayfair and Belgravia, making an unabashed play for the high-rollers, ensuring that they were served extravagantly expensive food and wines. After gambling was legalised, he repeated the trick at the Clermont, a superb William Kent house at 44 Berkeley Square, which had a nightclub, Annabel's - named after Lady Annabel Birley (subsequently Goldsmith) - in its basement. But it was Aspinall's presence, his untamed personality, his apparent invulnerability, which lured the rich in, as much as the lavishness of his hospitality.</p> <p>As a boy, picnicking on the beach at Goring-by-Sea in Sussex, Aspinall had stayed to watch a swarm of wasps descend on a pot of honey; everyone else fled. At school at Rugby, he became the first boy in living memory to be \"quad-flogged\" by the head of house, infuriated by the maverick who wandered around the dormitory naked. Even at the last election, when he stood as a Referendum party candidate, the Observer described one of his speeches concerning the five English tribes - the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Danes and Normans - as \"a compelling, entrancing performance\".</p> <p>But, according to one former Clermont habitue, it was in the 60s that Aspinall was at the height of his powers, a blonde Rasputin who was \"splendid in his own way\", but also \"a fairly sinister figure... He was articulate, intelligent, very good looking. He had this fatal attraction. He gave people the impression that if they didn't play they weren't up to much. Some were timid, wet, feeble and rose to the bait with disastrous consequences.\"</p> <p>Lucky Lucan, he remembers, was invariably present, with his wife, Veronica, sitting, vacant-eyed, at his side. But Lucan's losses meant that he had assumed a different status from other gamblers. \"Aspers would despatch Lucan to bring people in - it was done without disclosing that they were playing with house money. A lot of one's contemporaries came to grief. Bill Stirling [brother of David, founder of the SAS] ran out of Goyas, ran out of everything [including his Perthshire seat and 20,000 acres, which Stirling sold to Mahdi Al-Tajir, an Arab billionaire, without informing his wife]. John [the 18th Earl of] Derby had enough money. The scale of the gambling was staggering. It was a strange sort of episode.\"</p> <p>Aspinall, who lost and remade fortunes throughout his adult life, played at his own tables for as long as the law allowed. \"It added a certain tension, a certain madness,\" he reflected, not long before his death.</p> <p>Inevitably, though, others lost far more than their host. One of them, Henry Vyner, heir to an estate which included Studley Royal and Fountains Abbey, accepted financial destruction with impeccable equanimity, greeting one disastrous evening (according to Annabel Goldsmith) by \"announcing languidly at five in the morning: 'I suppose I shall have to sell some of my outlying farms.'\"</p> <p>In the end, Vyner lost the lot, though Aspinall's friends asserted that it was a calamitous investment - made against Aspinall's advice - which finally did for him. Whatever the truth in Vyner's case, the Clermont was so successful in allowing British gentlemen to \"ruin themselves elegantly and suicidally\" that, latterly, Aspinall was obliged to extend the privilege to their Arabian counterparts.</p> <p>Quite how damaging the Arabs' losses were was harder to gauge, since they did not have ancient estates to sell nor Old Masters to consign to auction at Sotheby's or Christie's. But one gambler who was playing at Aspinall's second casino - established in 1978 and initially called, quite simply, Aspinall's Club, later, the Aspinall Curzon - sustained almost incomprehensible losses.</p> <p>An industry insider who enjoyed a close working relationship with Aspinall during the 1980s, leading up to the sale of the Aspinall Curzon in 1987 (it was bought by Peter de Savary's leisure company, Alfred Walker, for \u00a390m), recalls how, at a pre-sale press conference, Aspinall was asked how many high-rollers he depended on to maintain the casino's profits. Aspinall replied by holding both hands in the air, and saying that the number of high-rollers was \"fewer than this\" - a reference to his 10 fingers. Later, in private, he admitted that he was, in fact, dependent on just one patron, a Kuwaiti.</p> <p>Aspinall's former assistant remembers: \"This Kuwaiti lost \u00a393m, his whole inheritance, in the course of one or two years. They could not take it off him quickly enough. That's what enabled Aspinall to sell it [the casino] at a mammoth profit.\" With the Kuwaiti a busted flush, the casino's profits sagged: the following year, de Savary sold Aspinall's to a firm called Leisure Investments; and, by 1990, Aspinall was able to buy back his old haunt - for just \u00a36m.</p> <p>Remarkably, the 50-year-old Kuwaiti feels no anger, still less, bitterness. Recently, on a visit to London, he agreed to talk to me, on condition that his identity was protected, explaining that, in the claustrophobic world of Kuwaiti business, past disclosures would damage him and his family (Muslims are forbidden to gamble).</p> <p>Despite what happened, he said he had only good memories of Aspinall. Speaking in enthusiastic but imprecise English, he said: \"He was a good man, a nice man, a gentleman. I sit with him in the bar, and have a nice glass with him. He was very cheering. He had a nice mother. She was also playing. It was a family club, you could say, at the time.\"</p> <p>Unlike the Sultan of Brunei - who was another dedicated habitue of Aspinall's during the 80s - the Kuwaiti gambler said that he did not like playing in a private room, a privilege that was usually accorded to high-rollers.</p> <p>The claim that he had lost more than \u00a390m within two or three years was, he said, \"exaggerated\", but he acknowledged that the figure was \"unbelievable. I don't have a record for it\". He was, he added, now a contented man. \"I have my family. My children have married, they have children. Everybody has in his life something good and bad, you see. Let's say these were good and bad days. It was fun but it was really bad, you see. Everybody who has done something bad has to put it behind him.\"</p> <p>These days, he added, he goes to casinos only to see friends and to have dinner. And he has inculcated a simple lesson into his children: \"This is the first thing to do in their life: not to gamble - to throw their money in the street, but not to gamble. To throw ten thousand in the street, but not to gamble a hundred.\"</p> <p>Aspinall might be disappointed. \"Reason is the worst possible guide to human affairs,\" he argued four years ago. \"It is merely the undertaker that you send in after the battle to explain the logic of the affair. Instinct and prejudice are much better guides.\"</p>",

Remarkably, the 50-year-old Kuwaiti feels no anger, still less, bitterness. Recently, on a visit to London, he agreed to talk to me, on condition that his identity was protected, explaining that, in the claustrophobic world of Kuwaiti business, past disclosures would damage him and his family (Muslims are forbidden to gamble). Despite what happened, he said he had only good memories of Aspinall. Speaking in enthusiastic but imprecise English, he said: \"He was a good man, a nice man, a gentleman. I sit with him in the bar, and have a nice glass with him. He was very cheering. He had a nice mother. She was also playing. It was a family club, you could say, at the time.\" Unlike the Sultan of Brunei - who was another dedicated habitue of Aspinall's during the 80s - the Kuwaiti gambler said that he did not like playing in a private room, a privilege that was usually accorded to high-rollers. The claim that he had lost more than \u00a390m within two or three years was, he said, \"exaggerated\", but he acknowledged that the figure was \"unbelievable. I don't have a record for it\". He was, he added, now a contented man. \"I have my family. My children have married, they have children. Everybody has in his life something good and bad, you see. Let's say these were good and bad days. It was fun but it was really bad, you see. Everybody who has done something bad has to put it behind him.\" These days, he added, he goes to casinos only to see friends and to have dinner. And he has inculcated a simple lesson into his children: \"This is the first thing to do in their life: not to gamble - to throw their money in the street, but not to gamble. To throw ten thousand in the street, but not to gamble a hundred.\" Aspinall might be disappointed. \"Reason is the worst possible guide to human affairs,\" he argued four years ago. \"It is merely the undertaker that you send in after the battle to explain the logic of the affair. Instinct and prejudice are much better guides.\"",

      "body": "<p>It is a quiet Sunday morning in rural Essex. There is little traffic on the roads and the sun shines weakly on the Peniel Pentecostal Church in Pilgrims Hatch, near Brentwood. At first sight there seems little out of the ordinary about the place - a plain, barn-like building that looks more like a village hall than a church. Then you notice the high metal fence and automated gates that surround the cluster of buildings. There is a large gun in the grounds fronting on to the road, pointing outwards. It was a gift, a piece of living history from the Ark Royal. And there's the car park. It's huge. Since when did churches need Tesco superstore-sized car parks?</p> <p>By about 9.30am worshippers are beginning to arrive in force. An army of shiny saloons, people carriers and Jeeps, filled with well-heeled families in their Sunday best, pours into the car park, where it is directed with practised efficiency by a team of parking attendants.</p> <p>Just before 10am, Michael Reid, a former policeman and insurance salesman who is the founder and leader of the Peniel, makes his way across the car park, keeping a close eye on me. I stick out like a sore thumb in my casual clothes amid the suits and matching separates. The service is about to begin.</p> <p>Bishop Reid's Peniel Pentecostal Church has occupied this unremarkable corner of Essex for a quarter of a century, steadily growing from a tiny house church made up of a couple of families who used to meet in one another's living rooms to a church with 600 regular worshippers, a high-achieving school for 160 children based in a beautiful Georgian mansion purchased for \u00a31.3m, and a college of higher education offering \"accredited\" American degree courses from Oral Roberts University (based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and set up by the controversial American evangelist Oral Roberts), with which Peniel has close links.</p> <p>It has attracted worshippers from all over the country, many of whom have left jobs, sold up and moved down to Pilgrims Hatch to be part of the church. Some arrive in groups, bringing friends and family. Others have come from abroad - the Peniel prides itself on including people from 37 nations among its congregation - and the rest are local, middle-class residents: doctors, dentists, teachers, nurses. Many are tithed, giving 10% of their gross income to the church and making it a wealthy organisation; its funds are also boosted by school and college fees.</p> <p>But as the success and popularity of the Peniel has grown over the years, so has the controversy surrounding the church. Independent churches, particularly successful ones like Peniel, often attract suspicions from outsiders. These suspicions are usually unjustified, says the Evangelical Alliance. In the Peniel's case there have been allegations - vehemently refuted by the church - that it has some of the characteristics of a cult. A small number of former members have described what in their view was excessive control exercised by the church over its congregation; they have told how they were frightened to leave, and how they were encouraged to cut off contact with family outside.</p> <p>There is also disquiet about claims of \"miracles\" at the Peniel. The church's website features testimonials from people who claim to have been cured of everything from eczema and endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome and deafness. Last year the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld a complaint against the Peniel over an advertisement that claimed a man who had been bedridden and dependent on painkillers for chronic sciatica was able to walk out of church pain-free and had not taken a painkiller since. After an investigation the ASA said it had found no evidence to back the claims and told the church it was in danger of raising the hopes of vulnerable people. The Peniel appealed, but the complaint was upheld. Seven years ago the ASA upheld a complaint against a claim made on behalf of a visiting guest speaker, Archbishop Benson Idahosa, who was said to have raised eight people from the dead.</p> <p>Then there are Reid's far-right views - gays are \"filthy perverts\"; Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists are variously described in videoed sermons as \"vile\" and \"foul heathens\". Christians who do not work, Reid said in one recording, should be allowed to starve. He believes in capital punishment, and he would pull the trigger himself; lethal injection is too good for them, he says in one church video. His teachings on the family are not to everyone's taste. Writing in the latest issue of the Peniel's newspaper, Reid says: \"Parents have a tremendous responsibility when they have children; fathers have the biggest responsibility, because God has placed them as 'head' of the household, to give leadership to the family by setting the standards.\" He continues: \"In today's society, however, many women have usurped the place that God gave to their husbands.\"</p> <p>And there have been concerns expressed about the church's attitude toward disciplining children. \"How do you drive something far from a child?\" Reid asks in one video of him preaching. \"Well you have a stick, and they have a rear end which God caused to be cushioned.\" Two boys have been given legal aid to pursue claims for personal injuries received as a result of assaults that they allege they received while they were at the church school, Peniel Academy. They claim they were hit with a tennis shoe on several occasions in a procedure known as \"paddling\".</p> <p>The Peniel strongly denies the allegations, which it describes as \"foul lies\". The school used to include corporal punishment as part of its discipline policy, in common with many independent schools at the time. It was used rarely, under strict guidelines, and only with the consent of parents. But since it was outlawed in private schools last year, it has no longer been used at all.</p> <p>Anne Brown, the Peniel's spokesperson, denied that Reid encouraged members of his congregation to use corporal punishment. \"He has gone on record in the past as saying that if a parent could number the smacks it has given a child on more than the fingers of one hand, they have failed. Michael's view is that parents must be consistent in their dealings with their children. They must have the courage to say 'no'. There are rare occasions when a smack is necessary, and preferable to the forms of discipline advocated by others, such as locking a child in its room, which he thinks is wrong. He thinks beating a child is never acceptable.\" The video clip, the church claims, was taken out of context and was meant to be a joke.</p> <p>The mother of the two boys suing the Peniel is also seeking to recover money she paid into the church in school fees and insurance policies she claims she was encouraged to take out by other members of the church. Reid, a former insurance salesman, has directorships with a number of insurance companies, including Baynes Roland and Macartney &amp;Dowie, and the allegation - again denied by the church - is that worshippers at the Peniel are encouraged to take out insurance with Reid's firms. (One of the firms is advertised in the latest issue of the church newspaper.)</p> <p>Responding to the allegation, Brown said neither Reid nor any other member of the church leadership had ever pressured people who attend Peniel to buy insurance. \"In fact he would take a very dim view of anyone in the church trying to use the congregation as a marketplace for their business, whatever it may be.\"</p> <p>But perhaps the most intriguing allegation facing the Peniel is that of entryism. The claim, again denied by the church, is that it infiltrated the local Tory party in order to gain political influence in the area. It is not a new story. It dates back almost three years to January 1998, when 119 members of the Peniel church joined the Pilgrims Hatch branch of the Conservative Association and were voted into key positions within the branch.</p> <p>The allegation is that Reid, frustrated after a planning application for a school sports hall was turned down by the local council, called on members of his church to join the Tory party so that he might gain some influence within local government. The church dismisses the claim as \"absurd\". Conservative Central Office was called in to investigate, but it found nothing amiss - key complainants, however, say that they were not even interviewed when Tory officials visited. The Evangelical Alliance, of which Peniel is a member, has also found that concerns that had been raised were \"groundless\".</p> <p>Yes, a number of people from the congregation did join the Tory party, says Brown; not as a coordinated effort to infiltrate the local association, however, but to support a fellow Peniel member, Robin Maillard, who had been active in the party for a number of years in a different constituency before moving to Pilgrims Hatch and intended to stand as a Conservative candidate in the local elections. \"Mr Reid has never suggested that members of the congregation join the Conservative - or any other - party to gain influence in local politics, or for any other reason.\"</p> <p>The allegations surfaced again last month with the news that Martin Bell, the former BBC correspondent who became the independent MP for Tatton, is considering standing as an independent for the safe Tory seat of Brentwood at the next general election. He has received 75 letters from Brentwood constituents, one of whom described it as \"a distressed constituency\", asking him to stand against the existing Tory 10,000 majority.</p> <p>\"There's obviously a lot of unhappiness in the area. I think that it might be a good opportunity to offer them a fresh start and take party politics out of the equation,\" said Bell.</p> <p>The Peniel is likely to remain in the public eye due to a number of pending legal actions involving the church and the Tories. As well as the action for damages detailed above, Bishop Reid and five of his church colleagues are suing a local independent Tory councillor, Tony Galbraith, for alleged libel over a press release he put out; the independent Conservatives are suing the official Conservatives for alleged libel over an election leaflet; and the police are investigating an alleged breach of electoral practice by the independents.</p> <p>One of the independent Tories expelled from the official party is its former treasurer, Tony Donnelly, who was among those who approached Bell. \"The Peniel church is the single largest group in Brentwood and Ongar Conservative Association,\" says Donnelly. \"They have the power to select and deselect the MP or any councillor. My fear is that the Peniel church is not just a church. It also has a political agenda. Their influence over the Conservative party is unhealthy and we've got to do something to stop it.\"</p> <p>But according to the Peniel, only five of the 30 members of the executive committee of Brentwood and Ongar Conservative Association attend the church. \"Hardly a ruling majority,\" says Brown.</p> <p>On the Sunday I visit, Reid and his congregation appear utterly unperturbed by the renewed speculation surrounding their church. Political infiltration? It is so ludicrous that they find it funny. The church is almost full. Inside it is more like a television studio than a church: video cameras are trained from every corner; there are big screens and microphones suspended from the ceiling; there is a photographer on hand; and there is an impressive little band in a special two-tier studio within the church.</p> <p>When I walk in, an elderly man welcomes me. He takes my hand and holds it for a long time. Then his other hand closes over the top of our two hands and he looks me directly in the eyes, asking me where I come from. Someone lends me a Bible so I can study the passages mentioned by the preachers. The 100-strong choir, resplendent in orange and pink, is awesome. Its members' faces are beatific; they even pogo with enthusiasm.</p> <p>Everyone is friendly, smiley, keen to strike up conversation. The children are impeccably behaved. They sit quietly throughout the two-hour service, like mini-students in a lecture hall, making careful notes of what Reid says throughout. A little girl with gaps between her teeth and hair escaping from her slides writes down dutifully: \"We should stand up for God. Christians should be involved in every area of life.\" The only child to make any noise - a little boy of about 18 months, dressed in a waistcoat and bow tie - is carried out by his dad, his hand over his son's mouth. Reid pauses as the boy is removed; a little while later he is carried back in, perfectly happy and perfectly quiet.</p> <p>Reid, once a Young Conservative and a member of the Tory party for many years, is very proud of an interview he has given to Radio 4 on the subject of his church and local politics, which he plays to his flock. In it he denies that his church has taken over the local Tory group. His church, he says, has no political agenda. \"I encourage every member to be fully involved in the community. If some of them have political persuasions I encourage them to join any party. I would not encourage one affiliation.\"</p> <p>He laughs off the interviewer's suggestion that the Peniel's newspaper, Trumpet Call, which has a print run of 90,000 and is distributed free among MPs, is anti-Blair - despite the latest issue which features a picture of the prime minister on its cover and the headline underneath: \"There IS a Better Way!\" (In one of his videoed sermons, he describes Blair and socialism as \"evil\".) \"We merely wanted to warn people to the fact that Blair has not kept his word or his promises,\" Reid explains in his interview. \"Any church member should do that. He has not helped the people who live in the country. Many farmers are under terrible financial pressures; some have committed suicide because of the policies of this government. I think we as churchmen should stand up for the people who are oppressed by the government.\"</p> <p>The interview is greeted with loud applause. Then Reid says: \"Praise God. Amen. God is good - all the time. I don't like the smears and that. But thank God we've got a decent MP.\"</p> <p>The MP Reid refers to is Eric Pickles, who holds the safe Tory seat of Brentwood and Ongar. He is not a member of the Peniel; he occasionally attends carol services, but denies any link between Reid's church and the Tory party. His press agent, Keith Brown, does, however, worship at the church; he also acts as the Peniel's press agent. \"Keith is very good at keeping things separate,\" says the church's Anne Brown.</p> <p>Pickles, likewise, rejects any suggestion that there is a link. \"Has at any time any member of that church sought to change my views on any thing? The answer is no. Does Keith come and talk to me about the church? The answer is definitely no.\"</p> <p>His view is that the objections of the independent Tories are nothing to do with a church taking over, but merely an extension of the political infighting that had been going on for some time in the constituency. There had been a move by Conservative Central Office to galvanise local associations such as Brentwood and Ongar into gaining new members and boosting funds; some long-serving members inevitably felt squeezed out.</p> <p>As for the Peniel and Reid: yes, Reid is a member of the Quota Club, an exclusive Tory dining club for which members pay \u00a31,000 a year (Reid as an individual, not on behalf of the Peniel, Anne Brown points out).</p> <p>Pickles says he last saw Reid at a civic function in March. He does not share Reid's extreme rightwing views. \"All I can do is judge by what the other local churches are saying. The other churches in Brentwood are quite happy to cooperate with him. If they were not happy to cooperate then I think I would be concerned.\"</p> <p>Whatever the truth about local politics in Brentwood and Ongar, there are clearly people who believe they have been traumatised by their experience at Peniel, such as Ann Barker, now 33, who went to stay at the church for help with health problems but ran away after four months, fleeing under cover of darkness at five in the morning.</p> <p>\"The reason I ran away was because they would not let me go home. I told them I was unhappy and wanted to go home. They said, 'You are here to stay.' They knew I had no means of going home - no money and no contact with anyone. I had nobody to talk to, to ask, 'How do you get away?' They were all of the same mind. Once somebody comes you stay.\"</p> <p>Ten years on she says: \"It was a horrendous experience. I can't say they helped me. They would speak to you and say things that are very condemning. They would say, 'You are rebelling. Carry on like this and you will go to hell.' When I ran away, the feeling of relief was absolutely amazing.\"</p> <p>Or Bill and Jackie Jones (not their real names), who were planning to leave the church. They say they were grilled by senior church members for two hours to encourage them to stay. \"People took it too far,\" says Bill. \"They were puppets. They could not think for themselves.\"</p> <p>Max Carter, who has known Reid for more than 30 years, moved his family down from Lancashire to join the church, which he left 12 years ago after five years' involvement. \"My concerns began to grow because Michael seemed to be influencing people's lives more and more. It's very difficult to see when you are in it. He would say things like, 'You are free to come, you are free to go; the door opens both ways. If you want to go to hell, go.'</p> <p>\"Michael wanted me to get more and more involved, but I did not. We got into repentance. It became a repenting church, hours of repenting, screaming out your sins to God in the church. It really became awful.\"</p> <p>The church responds in detail to each of these allegations. \"Over a period of 24 years in the life of a church, many people come seeking help for a variety of reasons,\" says Brown. \"Unfortunately there will of course be one or two who we are unable to help, or who do not want the help we can offer.\"</p> <p>Barker, the church claims, stayed for a short period, seemed to be happier and making progress, but decided Peniel was not for her and left. \"It is ludicrous to suggest that we make it difficult for people to leave the church - plenty of people have come and gone in the time since the church was founded.\" Yes, they went through a period of public repentance - but that was over 10 years ago and has not taken place since.</p> <p>There are no miracles on the Sunday I visit. There is no repenting, or screaming out of sins. There is a long address by the Rev Winnie Owiti from Kenya, and just a few words from Reid. There is a collection - even though Reid says he does not believe in collections - for an orphanage in Kenya. The members of his congregation are generous: they do not just dig deep in their pockets for change; there is a rustle of chequebooks as worshippers write out sums of \u00a340 and \u00a350. Children hand over \u00a35 and \u00a310 notes.</p> <p>Reid looks and sounds a bit like a stand-up comedian; he cracks a few jokes. There are little digs at the Anglican church and little digs at his wife Ruth, which everyone finds funny. There is tea and coffee afterwards - like any other church - and a flurry of purchases at the Peniel's rather upmarket shop, featuring a wide variety of videos, CDs and books produced by the church's own publishing arm, Alive UK.</p> <p>Bishop Reid himself is spirited away. He is much too busy for an interview with the Guardian. No, he can not talk to us tomorrow, because the miracle worker has broken his wrist after falling off his mountain bike, and it needs treatment.</p> <p>Gradually the hall empties. The shiny saloons, people carriers and Jeeps drive off, the automated gates swing shut and - for today at least - peace and quiet return to the Essex countryside.</p>",

As well as the action for damages detailed above, Bishop Reid and five of his church colleagues are suing a local independent Tory councillor, Tony Galbraith, for alleged libel over a press release he put out; the independent Conservatives are suing the official Conservatives for alleged libel over an election leaflet; and the police are investigating an alleged breach of electoral practice by the independents. One of the independent Tories expelled from the official party is its former treasurer, Tony Donnelly, who was among those who approached Bell. \"The Peniel church is the single largest group in Brentwood and Ongar Conservative Association,\" says Donnelly. \"They have the power to select and deselect the MP or any councillor. My fear is that the Peniel church is not just a church. It also has a political agenda. Their influence over the Conservative party is unhealthy and we've got to do something to stop it.\" But according to the Peniel, only five of the 30 members of the executive committee of Brentwood and Ongar Conservative Association attend the church. \"Hardly a ruling majority,\" says Brown. On the Sunday I visit, Reid and his congregation appear utterly unperturbed by the renewed speculation surrounding their church. Political infiltration? It is so ludicrous that they find it funny. The church is almost full. Inside it is more like a television studio than a church: video cameras are trained from every corner; there are big screens and microphones suspended from the ceiling; there is a photographer on hand; and there is an impressive little band in a special two-tier studio within the church. When I walk in, an elderly man welcomes me. He takes my hand and holds it for a long time. Then his other hand closes over the top of our two hands and he looks me directly in the eyes, asking me where I come from. Someone lends me a Bible so I can study the passages mentioned by the preachers. The 100-strong choir, resplendent in orange and pink, is awesome. Its members' faces are beatific; they even pogo with enthusiasm. Everyone is friendly, smiley, keen to strike up conversation. The children are impeccably behaved. They sit quietly throughout the two-hour service, like mini-students in a lecture hall, making careful notes of what Reid says throughout. A little girl with gaps between her teeth and hair escaping from her slides writes down dutifully: \"We should stand up for God. Christians should be involved in every area of life.\" The only child to make any noise - a little boy of about 18 months, dressed in a waistcoat and bow tie - is carried out by his dad, his hand over his son's mouth. Reid pauses as the boy is removed; a little while later he is carried back in, perfectly happy and perfectly quiet. Reid, once a Young Conservative and a member of the Tory party for many years, is very proud of an interview he has given to Radio 4 on the subject of his church and local politics, which he plays to his flock. In it he denies that his church has taken over the local Tory group. His church, he says, has no political agenda. \"I encourage every member to be fully involved in the community. If some of them have political persuasions I encourage them to join any party. I would not encourage one affiliation.\" He laughs off the interviewer's suggestion that the Peniel's newspaper, Trumpet Call, which has a print run of 90,000 and is distributed free among MPs, is anti-Blair - despite the latest issue which features a picture of the prime minister on its cover and the headline underneath: \"There IS a Better Way!\" (In one of his videoed sermons, he describes Blair and socialism as \"evil\".) \"We merely wanted to warn people to the fact that Blair has not kept his word or his promises,\" Reid explains in his interview. \"Any church member should do that. He has not helped the people who live in the country. Many farmers are under terrible financial pressures; some have committed suicide because of the policies of this government. I think we as churchmen should stand up for the people who are oppressed by the government.\" The interview is greeted with loud applause. Then Reid says: \"Praise God. Amen. God is good - all the time. I don't like the smears and that. But thank God we've got a decent MP.\" The MP Reid refers to is Eric Pickles, who holds the safe Tory seat of Brentwood and Ongar. He is not a member of the Peniel; he occasionally attends carol services, but denies any link between Reid's church and the Tory party. His press agent, Keith Brown, does, however, worship at the church; he also acts as the Peniel's press agent. \"Keith is very good at keeping things separate,\" says the church's Anne Brown. Pickles, likewise, rejects any suggestion that there is a link. \"Has at any time any member of that church sought to change my views on any thing? The answer is no. Does Keith come and talk to me about the church? The answer is definitely no.\" His view is that the objections of the independent Tories are nothing to do with a church taking over, but merely an extension of the political infighting that had been going on for some time in the constituency. There had been a move by Conservative Central Office to galvanise local associations such as Brentwood and Ongar into gaining new members and boosting funds; some long-serving members inevitably felt squeezed out. As for the Peniel and Reid: yes, Reid is a member of the Quota Club, an exclusive Tory dining club for which members pay \u00a31,000 a year (Reid as an individual, not on behalf of the Peniel, Anne Brown points out). Pickles says he last saw Reid at a civic function in March. He does not share Reid's extreme rightwing views. \"All I can do is judge by what the other local churches are saying. The other churches in Brentwood are quite happy to cooperate with him. If they were not happy to cooperate then I think I would be concerned.\" Whatever the truth about local politics in Brentwood and Ongar, there are clearly people who believe they have been traumatised by their experience at Peniel, such as Ann Barker, now 33, who went to stay at the church for help with health problems but ran away after four months, fleeing under cover of darkness at five in the morning. \"The reason I ran away was because they would not let me go home. I told them I was unhappy and wanted to go home. They said, 'You are here to stay.' They knew I had no means of going home - no money and no contact with anyone. I had nobody to talk to, to ask, 'How do you get away?' They were all of the same mind. Once somebody comes you stay.\" Ten years on she says: \"It was a horrendous experience. I can't say they helped me. They would speak to you and say things that are very condemning. They would say, 'You are rebelling. Carry on like this and you will go to hell.' When I ran away, the feeling of relief was absolutely amazing.\" Or Bill and Jackie Jones (not their real names), who were planning to leave the church. They say they were grilled by senior church members for two hours to encourage them to stay. \"People took it too far,\" says Bill. \"They were puppets. They could not think for themselves.\" Max Carter, who has known Reid for more than 30 years, moved his family down from Lancashire to join the church, which he left 12 years ago after five years' involvement. \"My concerns began to grow because Michael seemed to be influencing people's lives more and more. It's very difficult to see when you are in it. He would say things like, 'You are free to come, you are free to go; the door opens both ways. If you want to go to hell, go.' \"Michael wanted me to get more and more involved, but I did not. We got into repentance. It became a repenting church, hours of repenting, screaming out your sins to God in the church. It really became awful.\" The church responds in detail to each of these allegations. \"Over a period of 24 years in the life of a church, many people come seeking help for a variety of reasons,\" says Brown. \"Unfortunately there will of course be one or two who we are unable to help, or who do not want the help we can offer.\" Barker, the church claims, stayed for a short period, seemed to be happier and making progress, but decided Peniel was not for her and left. \"It is ludicrous to suggest that we make it difficult for people to leave the church - plenty of people have come and gone in the time since the church was founded.\" Yes, they went through a period of public repentance - but that was over 10 years ago and has not taken place since. There are no miracles on the Sunday I visit. There is no repenting, or screaming out of sins. There is a long address by the Rev Winnie Owiti from Kenya, and just a few words from Reid. There is a collection - even though Reid says he does not believe in collections - for an orphanage in Kenya. The members of his congregation are generous: they do not just dig deep in their pockets for change; there is a rustle of chequebooks as worshippers write out sums of \u00a340 and \u00a350. Children hand over \u00a35 and \u00a310 notes. Reid looks and sounds a bit like a stand-up comedian; he cracks a few jokes. There are little digs at the Anglican church and little digs at his wife Ruth, which everyone finds funny. There is tea and coffee afterwards - like any other church - and a flurry of purchases at the Peniel's rather upmarket shop, featuring a wide variety of videos, CDs and books produced by the church's own publishing arm, Alive UK. Bishop Reid himself is spirited away. He is much too busy for an interview with the Guardian. No, he can not talk to us tomorrow, because the miracle worker has broken his wrist after falling off his mountain bike, and it needs treatment. Gradually the hall empties. The shiny saloons, people carriers and Jeeps drive off, the automated gates swing shut and - for today at least - peace and quiet return to the Essex countryside.",

      "body": "<p>It's autumn in America, and there's a bloodbath on television. It happens every year, and no, it's not a renewed debate about violence on TV. It's the annual slaughter of the sickly children of the fall network TV season. The new shows debut on the big networks. Everyone crosses their fingers and nervously awaits the arrival of the Nielsen ratings. If your show goes over big, you'll probably survive for a few weeks, possibly even for the entire season. You might even be back next year. </p> <p>And then again, you might not. Short-term expectations are insanely high. You need to make a splash immediately. If that doesn't happen, your show takes an early bath - forget about nursing sick shows along - and something else moves into your time slot. Your show might not even last a fortnight before they axe it and start handing out the P45s. </p> <p>All that creative development, all your seed capital, all those focus groups and test screenings, all those delicate negotiations with network execs, show creators, crew and talent, and all their sharky business representatives - all for nothing, as the suits take your dream TV show off to a quiet place near the freight elevators and shoot it in the back of the head. When your show debuted, you dreamed of a ten-year run, critical plaudits, a place in the national culture, perhaps, and of the millions to be made in syndicated rerun fees. But right now all you have left is a potentially trouser-filling appointment with your bank manager. </p> <p>This carnival of carnage has been especially entertaining this autumn because so many other TV events have delayed the launch of the new season. First there was the Presidential candidates' refusal to set clear dates for their three debates, the conclusion of which usually marks the kick-off point for the new season in an election year. Then there were the Olympics, which got the most wretched ratings in US TV history. </p> <p>The result is that the unveiling of new shows has been staggered over an unusually long period, which somewhat diminishes the coherent sense of a new generation of TV programmes. </p> <p>British viewers will never even see some of these shows - and in most cases that's no great loss. Every year a few programmes are so bad that you wonder to what species the people who greenlighted them belong. </p> <p>Judging by the slew of disasters foisted upon us (and then cancelled) by the NBC network, I would guess that their decision-makers belong to some obscure category of higher mollusc. \"NBC\", quipped one critic after a particularly brutal culling of new shows, \"currently stands for 'Nothing But Catastrophes'.\" Among the catastrophes were the gormless family sitcom Daddio, which was placed \"on indefinite hiatus\" (meaning they'll execute you when no one's looking), and Tucker, a dire family comedy that was axed after critics called it a rip-off of Fox's wonderful Malcolm In The Middle. </p> <p>Deadline, a newspaper series starring Oliver Platt, from Law And Order creator Dick Wolf, was spiked after five lacklustre outings. Those three programmes constitute two-thirds of the network's Monday night line-up, which now looks like the Manhattan skyline minus half the skyscrapers. </p> <p>The Michael Richards Show fell on its backside in its second week despite hopes that it might benefit from some intangible \"Seinfeld factor\". The critics were brutal: \"It has sagging letdown written all over it\", said one; \"a devastating bomb... it's awful\", chimed in another, as cheerful as a leper's bell. Now the axe hovers above Richards's neck. </p> <p>None of the other networks has been as troubled as NBC, but each one has cancelled something, and a good number of remaining shows are looking very unsteady on their feet. Fox has pulled Freakylinks, an X-Files-style mystery developed by the Blair Witch team, and replaced it with another new show, Million Dollar Mysteries. The WB Channel has already yanked its newlywed comedy For Your Love. </p> <p>Even the big hitters are stumbling. Melrose Place and Sex In The City creator Darren Star took a critical drubbing for his Wall Street sex-drama The Street, which was ridiculed by, among other people, Wall Street traders. And his teen spoof soap Grosse Pointe has already been rescheduled half to death on the WB Channel. David E Kelley's new high-school drama Boston Public was roundly ridiculed in a poll of students taken by the Boston Globe. </p> <p>Oddly, both Kelley (in Ally McBeal) and Star have current storylines featuring female characters blessed with penises. James Cameron meanwhile avoids chicks with dicks in his first TV venture, the action sci-fi thriller Dark Angel, choosing instead to rely on the high-kicking, chicks-in-charge formula he honed with ex-wife Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. </p> <p>Each of these shows will get a long leash, given the power and influence of the men behind them. But if they come a cropper they'll still be shown the door. The networks don't just axe bad shows: last year's cancellation of NBC's Freaks And Geeks and Fox's Hollywood comedy Action only proves that quality and good writing aren't considered adequate substitutes for a 12-point market share.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's autumn in America, and there's a bloodbath on television. It happens every year, and no, it's not a renewed debate about violence on TV. It's the annual slaughter of the sickly children of the fall network TV season. The new shows debut on the big networks. Everyone crosses their fingers and nervously awaits the arrival of the Nielsen ratings. If your show goes over big, you'll probably survive for a few weeks, possibly even for the entire season. You might even be back next year. And then again, you might not. Short-term expectations are insanely high. You need to make a splash immediately. If that doesn't happen, your show takes an early bath - forget about nursing sick shows along - and something else moves into your time slot. Your show might not even last a fortnight before they axe it and start handing out the P45s. All that creative development, all your seed capital, all those focus groups and test screenings, all those delicate negotiations with network execs, show creators, crew and talent, and all their sharky business representatives - all for nothing, as the suits take your dream TV show off to a quiet place near the freight elevators and shoot it in the back of the head. When your show debuted, you dreamed of a ten-year run, critical plaudits, a place in the national culture, perhaps, and of the millions to be made in syndicated rerun fees. But right now all you have left is a potentially trouser-filling appointment with your bank manager. This carnival of carnage has been especially entertaining this autumn because so many other TV events have delayed the launch of the new season. First there was the Presidential candidates' refusal to set clear dates for their three debates, the conclusion of which usually marks the kick-off point for the new season in an election year. Then there were the Olympics, which got the most wretched ratings in US TV history. The result is that the unveiling of new shows has been staggered over an unusually long period, which somewhat diminishes the coherent sense of a new generation of TV programmes. British viewers will never even see some of these shows - and in most cases that's no great loss. Every year a few programmes are so bad that you wonder to what species the people who greenlighted them belong. Judging by the slew of disasters foisted upon us (and then cancelled) by the NBC network, I would guess that their decision-makers belong to some obscure category of higher mollusc. \"NBC\", quipped one critic after a particularly brutal culling of new shows, \"currently stands for 'Nothing But Catastrophes'.\" Among the catastrophes were the gormless family sitcom Daddio, which was placed \"on indefinite hiatus\" (meaning they'll execute you when no one's looking), and Tucker, a dire family comedy that was axed after critics called it a rip-off of Fox's wonderful Malcolm In The Middle. Deadline, a newspaper series starring Oliver Platt, from Law And Order creator Dick Wolf, was spiked after five lacklustre outings. Those three programmes constitute two-thirds of the network's Monday night line-up, which now looks like the Manhattan skyline minus half the skyscrapers. The Michael Richards Show fell on its backside in its second week despite hopes that it might benefit from some intangible \"Seinfeld factor\". The critics were brutal: \"It has sagging letdown written all over it\", said one; \"a devastating bomb... it's awful\", chimed in another, as cheerful as a leper's bell. Now the axe hovers above Richards's neck. None of the other networks has been as troubled as NBC, but each one has cancelled something, and a good number of remaining shows are looking very unsteady on their feet. Fox has pulled Freakylinks, an X-Files-style mystery developed by the Blair Witch team, and replaced it with another new show, Million Dollar Mysteries. The WB Channel has already yanked its newlywed comedy For Your Love. Even the big hitters are stumbling. Melrose Place and Sex In The City creator Darren Star took a critical drubbing for his Wall Street sex-drama The Street, which was ridiculed by, among other people, Wall Street traders. And his teen spoof soap Grosse Pointe has already been rescheduled half to death on the WB Channel. David E Kelley's new high-school drama Boston Public was roundly ridiculed in a poll of students taken by the Boston Globe. Oddly, both Kelley (in Ally McBeal) and Star have current storylines featuring female characters blessed with penises. James Cameron meanwhile avoids chicks with dicks in his first TV venture, the action sci-fi thriller Dark Angel, choosing instead to rely on the high-kicking, chicks-in-charge formula he honed with ex-wife Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. Each of these shows will get a long leash, given the power and influence of the men behind them. But if they come a cropper they'll still be shown the door. The networks don't just axe bad shows: last year's cancellation of NBC's Freaks And Geeks and Fox's Hollywood comedy Action only proves that quality and good writing aren't considered adequate substitutes for a 12-point market share.",

      "body": "<p>I've always thought that the health secretary, Alan Milburn, resembled a Geordie bouncer, with his truculent manner and preference for shouting people down rather than exchanging the delicate nuances of argument.</p> <p>I see him outside some naff north-eastern club, possibly called Tropicana, all pink and blue neon palm trees. From inside you can hear the insistent bass pulse of house, or garage, or perhaps potting shed music. Wearing a tuxedo - not quite all the bloodstains have washed out yet - a baseball bat to hand, he brooks no disagreement from those whom he wishes to debar from the premises.</p> <p>I consulted a friend from that part of the world about what the old Milburn would have said in his role as bouncer. He replied: \"He might say 'Oi, marra! Fook off out or a'll fooking brain ya!' This is normally spoken in a soft, soothing voice, as if reading a bedtime story.\"</p> <p>But all is changed. Perhaps he was frightened by the ghost of health secretaries past, but the new Milburn is a nicer bouncer. Yesterday he told the Commons how he was going to dish out an extra \u00a337bn a year to health authorities in England.</p> <p>This was a lovable bouncer, a bouncer from the Tigger school of bouncing. He would offer people money to go in, plus a book of vouchers good for free ready-mixed cocktails. Old persons would try to get in. \"I'm not so nippy on me pins these days, Mr Milburn,\" they would explain, and he would reply: \"You're welcome anyway. Just dance round your Zimmer frames! Have a drink on us!\"</p> <p>Mr Milburn dispensed money like a pantomime Buttons tossing chocolate bars to the audience. There would be an average of \u00a329m each for health authorities. \"Oooh!\" said Labour MPs. There would be an extra \u00a365m to recruit nurses and midwives. Ward sisters would be showered with gold. There would soon be a mere 30-minute wait for \"life-saving clot-busting drugs\" - which sounds like something the Commons could use.</p> <p>\"We are winning the war on waiting lists!\" he went on, though this sounded less impressive later when he said waits for hospital treatment would be \"wicks, rather than munz\" - in 2008, that is.</p> <p>Immediately afterwards Kevin McNamara made one of his periodic attempts to abolish the oath of allegiance for MPs. He believes this is an anachronism which de mands fealty to the Queen but makes no reference to the voters. Tories believe it is really an attempt by Mr McNamara, who is sympathetic to the Irish republican cause, to get Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness into the House. They won't sit because they refuse to swear loyalty to Her Maj.</p> <p>Mr McNamara was perhaps lucky in that his opponent was the Conservatives' Gerald Howarth, who defended the oath by saying it was \"a bulwark against Catholicism!\". As Labour MPs gleefully pointed at the very Catholic Ann Widdecombe, he tried to row back: \"Catholicism used to represent a challenge to the sovereignty of these islands. But it no longer is,\" he pleaded lamely. \"Too late, too late!\" yelled Dennis Skinner, as Ms Widdecombe almost laughed herself off the bench.</p> <p>And too late it was. Mr Howarth may now be known as the Oaf of Allegiance.</p> <p>Though he did win. Changing the Commons' ancient ways is always appallingly difficult. For example, John Maxton complained about traditional divisions, each of which takes 15 minutes and can occupy hours in any one day. \"Isn't it urgent for us to introduce electronic voting?\" he demanded.</p> <p>\"Ask the Americans!\" shouted a Tory to howls of joy. Sometimes a passionate, well-expressed argument can be utterly deflated by a single phrase.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I've always thought that the health secretary, Alan Milburn, resembled a Geordie bouncer, with his truculent manner and preference for shouting people down rather than exchanging the delicate nuances of argument. I see him outside some naff north-eastern club, possibly called Tropicana, all pink and blue neon palm trees. From inside you can hear the insistent bass pulse of house, or garage, or perhaps potting shed music. Wearing a tuxedo - not quite all the bloodstains have washed out yet - a baseball bat to hand, he brooks no disagreement from those whom he wishes to debar from the premises. I consulted a friend from that part of the world about what the old Milburn would have said in his role as bouncer. He replied: \"He might say 'Oi, marra! Fook off out or a'll fooking brain ya!' This is normally spoken in a soft, soothing voice, as if reading a bedtime story.\" But all is changed. Perhaps he was frightened by the ghost of health secretaries past, but the new Milburn is a nicer bouncer. Yesterday he told the Commons how he was going to dish out an extra \u00a337bn a year to health authorities in England. This was a lovable bouncer, a bouncer from the Tigger school of bouncing. He would offer people money to go in, plus a book of vouchers good for free ready-mixed cocktails. Old persons would try to get in. \"I'm not so nippy on me pins these days, Mr Milburn,\" they would explain, and he would reply: \"You're welcome anyway. Just dance round your Zimmer frames! Have a drink on us!\" Mr Milburn dispensed money like a pantomime Buttons tossing chocolate bars to the audience. There would be an average of \u00a329m each for health authorities. \"Oooh!\" said Labour MPs. There would be an extra \u00a365m to recruit nurses and midwives. Ward sisters would be showered with gold. There would soon be a mere 30-minute wait for \"life-saving clot-busting drugs\" - which sounds like something the Commons could use. \"We are winning the war on waiting lists!\" he went on, though this sounded less impressive later when he said waits for hospital treatment would be \"wicks, rather than munz\" - in 2008, that is. Immediately afterwards Kevin McNamara made one of his periodic attempts to abolish the oath of allegiance for MPs. He believes this is an anachronism which de mands fealty to the Queen but makes no reference to the voters. Tories believe it is really an attempt by Mr McNamara, who is sympathetic to the Irish republican cause, to get Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness into the House. They won't sit because they refuse to swear loyalty to Her Maj. Mr McNamara was perhaps lucky in that his opponent was the Conservatives' Gerald Howarth, who defended the oath by saying it was \"a bulwark against Catholicism!\". As Labour MPs gleefully pointed at the very Catholic Ann Widdecombe, he tried to row back: \"Catholicism used to represent a challenge to the sovereignty of these islands. But it no longer is,\" he pleaded lamely. \"Too late, too late!\" yelled Dennis Skinner, as Ms Widdecombe almost laughed herself off the bench. And too late it was. Mr Howarth may now be known as the Oaf of Allegiance. Though he did win. Changing the Commons' ancient ways is always appallingly difficult. For example, John Maxton complained about traditional divisions, each of which takes 15 minutes and can occupy hours in any one day. \"Isn't it urgent for us to introduce electronic voting?\" he demanded. \"Ask the Americans!\" shouted a Tory to howls of joy. Sometimes a passionate, well-expressed argument can be utterly deflated by a single phrase.",

In late 1963, Chambers was briefly with another Liverpool group, the Big Three, before passingthrough the Dominoes.</p> <p>In Hamburg, the Dominoes' drummer Gibson Kemp, Lewis Collins (later of LWT's The Professionals) and Chambers set up a proto-jazz rock group, the Eyes. Collins quit, to be replaced by the German bass player Klaus Voorman. Thus was Paddy, Klaus And Gibson born.</p> <p>In London, pop manager Tony Stratton-Smith was impressed. He booked the group for the then chic Pickwick club. At the urging of the Beatles, Brian Epstein, enthralled particularly by Chambers, bought out Stratton-Smith's contract in 1965, though success did not follow and, in 1966, the band split up. Chambers teamed up with Beryl Marsden, one of the best, if little recognised, female singers to emerge from Liverpool in the period. They formed Sinbad, the house band at the city's Victoriana club.</p> <p>By the mid-1980s, Chambers had diversified into managing local groups. He is survived by his wife Joy, daughter and grandson.</p> <p>Patrick John 'Paddy' Chambers, guitarist, born April 30 1944; died September 28 2000</p>",

In 1962, after a stint in Paris with a jazz group, Chambers joined Faron's Flamingoes. At the height of the 1963 Liverpool boom, the band was a major palais attraction, but signing with an obscure record label led to two flop singles. In late 1963, Chambers was briefly with another Liverpool group, the Big Three, before passingthrough the Dominoes. In Hamburg, the Dominoes' drummer Gibson Kemp, Lewis Collins (later of LWT's The Professionals) and Chambers set up a proto-jazz rock group, the Eyes. Collins quit, to be replaced by the German bass player Klaus Voorman. Thus was Paddy, Klaus And Gibson born. In London, pop manager Tony Stratton-Smith was impressed. He booked the group for the then chic Pickwick club. At the urging of the Beatles, Brian Epstein, enthralled particularly by Chambers, bought out Stratton-Smith's contract in 1965, though success did not follow and, in 1966, the band split up. Chambers teamed up with Beryl Marsden, one of the best, if little recognised, female singers to emerge from Liverpool in the period. They formed Sinbad, the house band at the city's Victoriana club. By the mid-1980s, Chambers had diversified into managing local groups. He is survived by his wife Joy, daughter and grandson. Patrick John 'Paddy' Chambers, guitarist, born April 30 1944; died September 28 2000",

They already knew that these were the masters of contemporary French literature. But they heard a lot about another novelist, Roger Peyrefitte, who has died aged 93, and they soon found themselves reading his bestseller, Les Amiti\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res, published in 1944 and translated into English as Special Friendships, in 1958.</p> <p>The novel was regarded as unusual - indeed, it was considered scandalous by some - because it dealt with the love affairs of pupils at a French boarding-school for boys. That the school was a religious establishment made it all the more sensational, since the liberation of 1944 had highlighted the old question of relations between private and religious education, and state schools. It was assumed that the book was largely autobiographical, and that the events it described were drawn from life.</p> <p>Andr\u00e9 Gide, who had attempted to defend homosexuality in a much earlier work, was prophetic in his congratulations to Peyrefitte. He did not think that Les Amiti\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res would win the Goncourt prize, but did believe it would still be read a century later.</p> <p>Indeed, Peyrefitte did not win the Goncourt. But the fact that the prize went to Elsa Triolet - by five votes against Peyrefitte's two - was seen as a manifestation of communist and resistance power (the decision was heavily criticised by both the Catholic and the right-wing press). So far as Gide's other prophecy is concerned, one can certainly say that Les Amiti\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res is still read, more than 50 years later.</p> <p>In the postwar years, Peyrefitte seemed likely to become prominent in the intellectual debate about the responsibility of writers. Sartre set the pace by claiming that a writer had to be committed to a cause. But, in 1945, Peyrefitte wrote that a writer had the right not to be committed to some set of principles or beliefs, conjuring up a world in which the writer was treated with indulgence. This angered many, who suggested that the attitude justified those writers who had supported Germany during the years of war.</p> <p>But Peyrefitte was not interested in pursuing this type of discussion; he was not an intellectual. He was born in Castres, in the Tarn, and his parents were farmers who had become comfortably well-off as they had become successful in trade and business. He used to say that there were only two things that mattered - to have money, and, if one had not been born with a famous name, to make oneself famous.</p> <p>He received a religious schooling, was expelled from philosophy classes because of bad behaviour, took a literary degree at the University of Toulouse, and attended the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques in Paris. He graduated in the diplomatic section and worked in the ministry for foreign affairs from 1931 to 1933. He was then secretary to the French embassy in Athens until 1938.</p> <p>It has been said that it was in Greece that Peyrefitte gained confirmation of his homosexuality. It was certainly there that he developed his interest in classical history and his preoccupation with romantic scenery. In 1938, he returned to the Quai d'Orsay, to work in the ministry.</p> <p>His relations with the Vichy government in 1940 are confused, but he continued to work with it and, in 1943, became assistant to Ferdinand de Brinon, the representative of the government to the German occupying authorities. In February 1945, Peyrefitte was dismissed, officially for this collaboration, but perhaps also because of a mysterious scandal. From then, he became a writer, and Les Amiti\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res, which won the Prix Renaudot, was a remarkable beginning.</p> <p>Peyrefitte never wrote another book with the same qualities, although he published more than 30. He wrote novels, essays - some of which adopted the form of novels - biographies, dramas and translations. They were all well written and the result of hard work, although Peyrefitte liked to give the impression that he spent his time attending grand receptions in high society.</p> <p>But they all sought to be successful because they revealed hidden scandals and secrets. They caused great embarrassment to his distant relative Alain Peyrefitte, who was 17 years his junior (Obituary, November 29 1999) and who was just beginning his career as a serious writer and politician.</p> <p>It would be tedious to list all these publications. Les Ambassades in 1951 (Diplomatic Diversions, 1953) was Peyrefitte's revenge against the diplomatic corps, showing what happens behind the official receptions and meetings. Les Clefs de Saint Pierre, in 1955 (The Keys of Saint Peter, 1957) did the same for the Vatican - which described it as lewdly libellous - and was prosecuted for obscenity in Italy, while Les Fils de la lumi\u00e8re (1961) took freemasonary as its target. Les Juifs (1965) sought to reveal all about certain Jews, especially the Rothschilds and Pierre Mend\u00e8s France. Les Americains (1968) led to Peyrefitte being sued by Marlene Dietrich - who won.</p> <p>Perhaps the most talented book was L'Exil\u00e9 de Capri (1959), which depicted the unhappy drama of a man whose early success in life turned to tragedy.

      "bodyText": "Heaven Eyes by David Almond (Hodder) \"First we enter a children's home, with its cement garden, embittered staff and despairing 'circle time': then Almond takes us on a terrifying but beautiful journey. Escaping through one of the most nightmarish landscapes ever devised by man - the deserted docklands of a great northern city - three runaways meet a strange child and a mad old man.\" (from a review) The judges: A beautifully written, thought-provoking story of friendship and hope that grips, with its stunning imagery and lyrical writing. Arthur: The Seeing Stone by Kevin Crossley-Holland (Orion) A pageant of the past, crowded with characters - Arthur's jealous older brother; the forthright village girl Gatty; Tanwen the serving girl. Life in a medieval manor, shot through with legends of King Arthur, with a thrilling climax. The judges: A superbly researched and descriptive tapestry of medieval life with an accessible take on the legends of King Arthur Troy by Adele Geras (Scholastic) \"The siege of Troy seen from below, from the kitchens and the stables and (a wonderful notion) the Blood Room, where the wounded are tended by the young Xanthe.\" (from a review). The judges: Brings the ancient story of Troy alive and takes the reader into the heart of history. Profoundly moving and gripping. Coram Boy by Jamila Gavin (Egmont) \"A ruthless dealer travels the drovers' roads of Georgian England purporting to carry abandoned infants to London's new hospital. In fact, he buries the babies ... while allowing older infants to starve to death.\" (from a review) The judges: An engrossing historical novel with life well beyond the pages of the book and superb narrative control over complex stories. Guardian choice: Almond. Runner up: Gavin",

      "bodyText": "The parents of a toddler who died from meningitis spoke yesterday of their \"vision of hell\" in a hospital's overstretched accident and emergency department which failed to diagnose his condition. Jacob Fogg, 22 months, died on the same day that doctors at the Whittington hospital in Highgate, north London, said tests did not indicate a life-threatening condition. Edward Fogg, his father, said the family spent seven hours prior to the misdiagnosis on a Sunday night last month in an area with dirty floors, exhausted doctors and rude nurses. Several of his allegations are disputed by the hospital. The parents said they took their son to the A&amp;E department on the evening of October 15 after he became feverish and drowsy at their home in Crouch End, north London. His condition was worsening and the couple were concerned he could have meningitis. They said the A&amp;E area was dirty, with drunks and drug addicts roaming around and a long queue to be assessed by a nurse. The family said they were told to wait in a room which had blood on the floor and urine samples in the sink while they waited for a doctor. Mr Fogg, 29, a fashion model, told the Evening Standard: \"We were disgusted. The place was unhygienic and we didn't want Jacob to come into contact with anything.\" Emma, his partner of five years, said: \"It was like being in a self-service hospital. We had to instigate everything.\" One nurse allegedly told them: \"If you don't like it, go to another hospital.\" A paediatrician saw their son three hours after they arrived. The doctor was \"blinking to stay awake and had big red tiredness blotches under his eyes,\" Mr Fogg said. At 3am doctors said a blood test had showed no evidence of meningitis and that the boy was exhibiting symptoms of flu. The parents took Jacob home, but later that morning he had large numbers of spots and seemed weaker. Doctors then diagnosed meningitis and Jacob was taken to Great Ormond Street hospital. He died at 4pm. Mr Fogg said: \"If the hospital had reacted differently our precious, beautiful little boy would in all probability still be with us today.\" In a statement the Whittington hospital said: \"The symptoms of meningococcal disease are notoriously non-specific in the early stages of the illness. Tests were carried out on Jacob and did not indicate that he had a life-threatening infection.\" Doctors wanted to keep Jacob in overnight but his parents decided to take him home, the hospital said. It added that cleaning staff were managed by the nurses, which \"enabled the hospital to greatly improve the cleanliness of the [A&amp;E] department\".",

      "bodyText": "Fresh doubts have emerged over the hotly disputed decision by senior RAF officers to blame the pilots for the crash of a Chinook helicopter into the Mull of Kintyre in 1994, killing all 29 people on board. New evidence shows the Ministry of Defence withheld potentially crucial information about computer software problems from Air Chief Marshal Sir William Wratten and Air Marshal Sir John Day who overruled the verdict of an RAF board of inquiry. The board found there was insufficient evidence to blame the pilots. The new evidence, given in parliamentary answers to Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, will be presented today to Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, by an all-party group, led by Lord Chalfont, a former Labour defence minister campaigning to get the verdict quashed. Twenty-five MI5, army, and RUC intelligence officers from Northern Ireland and the four crew died when the Chinook crashed into the Mull of Kintyre in June 1994. The two air marshals found the pilots, Jonathan Tapper and Rick Cook, guilty of gross negligence. The MoD has now admitted that at the time of the inquiry, Sir William Wratten \"did not recall\" an incident five years earlier when an RAF Chinook was nearly destroyed by a software problem during tests in the US. It also admitted that Sir William was not aware of the subsequent legal dispute between the MoD and Textron Lycoming, makers of the Fadec software. It has told Mr Field that while Sir John Day was aware of the incident he was \"not aware of the detail\". Papers leaked to Computer Weekly magazine show that in a legal action in the US, the MoD itself said the Fadec software was \"unsafe\". An RAF officer told the board of inquiry that problems with the Chinook's software had resulted in uncontrolled engine acceleration and cutouts and misleading instrument readings in the cockpit. The day before the crash on the Mull of Kintyre, the RAF stopped all test flying of its Chinooks because of concerns about the Fadec software. Under RAF rules in place at the time of the accident, crew could be blamed only when there was \"absolutely no doubt whatsoever\" that they were at fault. Lord Chalfont said yesterday that he would press Mr Hoon to exercise his prerogative and overturn the verdict of the two air marshals. Failing that, the MoD should reopen the inquiry, he said. Lord Chalfont has tabled a motion to set up a House of Lords committee to investigate the affair.",

The cost of the lodgings then was \u00a33.9m a year - nearly \u00a31m less than last year's bill. Savoy or Blackpool? For \u00a3901 a night, a high court judge could stay... One night at the Savoy in the river bedroom suite, separate living room with views over the Thames. \u00a3895 a night Two nights at the Ritz in London, in a junior suite, twice the size of standard double room. \u00a3450 a night Six nights at the Swallow, Bristol, in standard double, includes use of leisure club. \u00a3129 a night 10 nights at the Post House, Birmingham, in standard double. \u00a389 a night 18 nights at the Express Holiday Inn, Manchester, in a standard double room. \u00a349 a night 23 nights at the Fairway Hotel, Blackpool, in standard double, breakfast included. \u00a338 a night",

The consensus seems to be that American democracy is in a fragile and unhealthy state and that the electoral college is an outdated monstrosity. Despite the shenanigans going on in the banana republic of Florida and the media-created crisis, the rest of the US has remained calm. It may be a slow process but many seem to forget that the election in Florida will not be officially over until November 17 when all the absentee ballots are counted.</p> <p>There also seems to be agreement on your pages that our new Congress will be more evenly split and thus dysfunctional. Frankly, when European states are brought to a halt by striking farmers (France) or blockaded oil refineries (UK) or terrorists (Spain) or a paedophilia ring (Belgium), things don't look so good on your side of the Atlantic either.</p> <p>Your condemnation of the electoral college reveals a serious ignorance of American governance. One complication of governing a federal union is how to make the institutions democratic while still respecting the sovereignty of the member states. How do you ensure that the interests of small states are not trampled by large states? Our framers of the constitution answered that with the compromise known as the electoral college. I find it ironic that your writers are so quick to preach a \"remedy\" for the American union when the European Union is struggling to come up with an answer to this same question.

      "bodyText": "I have been fascinated by the editorial opinion in your paper over the internet. The consensus seems to be that American democracy is in a fragile and unhealthy state and that the electoral college is an outdated monstrosity. Despite the shenanigans going on in the banana republic of Florida and the media-created crisis, the rest of the US has remained calm. It may be a slow process but many seem to forget that the election in Florida will not be officially over until November 17 when all the absentee ballots are counted. There also seems to be agreement on your pages that our new Congress will be more evenly split and thus dysfunctional. Frankly, when European states are brought to a halt by striking farmers (France) or blockaded oil refineries (UK) or terrorists (Spain) or a paedophilia ring (Belgium), things don't look so good on your side of the Atlantic either. Your condemnation of the electoral college reveals a serious ignorance of American governance. One complication of governing a federal union is how to make the institutions democratic while still respecting the sovereignty of the member states. How do you ensure that the interests of small states are not trampled by large states? Our framers of the constitution answered that with the compromise known as the electoral college. I find it ironic that your writers are so quick to preach a \"remedy\" for the American union when the European Union is struggling to come up with an answer to this same question. If the uncertainty in Florida continues, the election will simply be decided without Florida having any say. Life will go on. Ryan Oyama Cambridge, Massachusetts royamahi@earthlink.net",

Given how little understanding we now have about how our genes work, slapping patents on them can only slow down the advance of publicly available scientific knowledge. Secondly, there are several issues raised by developing countries which argue that the knowledge economy is being stitched up for decades to come to their gross detriment, reinforcing a pattern of technological inequality. For example, western bio-prospectors are raiding the rich bio-diversity of developing countries to patent genes and the properties of plants which have long been part of indigenous knowledge. Another concern is that patents are gathering on staple food crops such as maize, rice and wheat which could disrupt centuries of farmers' own crossbreeding.

The screenings, of 10 scenes from the first two movies in the series, took place at Fox Studios in Sydney for an assembled marketing audience, and was introduced by the film's executive producer, Mark Odesky. </p> <p>Online spy reports register a cautiously enthusiastic response. \"Even without a film grade and finished effects the footage sent a shiver up my spine,\" says the scooper 'Vermont' on the <a href=\"http://www.darkhorizons.com/2001/LordOfTheRings.htm\">Dark Horizons</a> website. \"To say I can't wait for Boxing Day 2001 is a slight understatement.\" </p> <p>According to one critic at <a href=\"http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=\" 7474\"\">Ain't It Cool News</a>, \"what was really cool was the film seemed REAL - the landscape felt genuine and naturalistic, even in a medieval-type context. The real thing that stood out for me was how well Elijah Wood [who plays Frodo Baggins] seemed to TAKE the screen so confidently. He didn't seem like a kid. He had a sense of dignity and awe that made me feel like, 'Yup, I want to see this guy through this story'.\" </p> <p>Ian McKellen's Gandalf, meanwhile, was described as having \"majesty and dignity but also a weariness... he's obviously seen a lot in his time. Looks like a real wizard, not a guy in a cape with a funny hat.\"</p> <p>Director Peter Jackson, meanwhile, has held a press conference to herald the anniversary of production work on the film, at which the New Zealand director again assured fans of his project's loyalty to the books of JRR Tolkien. </p> <p>\"Way back at the beginning,\" he said, \"we thought there was quite a bit of this we are going to have to alter or change. But the more we got into it and the more we started to know the books in great detail, [the more] we've gone further and further back to the books. A lot of our so-called clever ideas at the beginning we've long since abandoned and Tolkien hopefully has a fairly clear voice in the film.\" </p> <p>The first film in the saga is released in December 2001.</p>",

The screenings, of 10 scenes from the first two movies in the series, took place at Fox Studios in Sydney for an assembled marketing audience, and was introduced by the film's executive producer, Mark Odesky. Online spy reports register a cautiously enthusiastic response. \"Even without a film grade and finished effects the footage sent a shiver up my spine,\" says the scooper 'Vermont' on the Dark Horizons website. \"To say I can't wait for Boxing Day 2001 is a slight understatement.\" According to one critic at Ain't It Cool News, \"what was really cool was the film seemed REAL - the landscape felt genuine and naturalistic, even in a medieval-type context. The real thing that stood out for me was how well Elijah Wood [who plays Frodo Baggins] seemed to TAKE the screen so confidently. He didn't seem like a kid. He had a sense of dignity and awe that made me feel like, 'Yup, I want to see this guy through this story'.\" Ian McKellen's Gandalf, meanwhile, was described as having \"majesty and dignity but also a weariness... he's obviously seen a lot in his time. Looks like a real wizard, not a guy in a cape with a funny hat.\" Director Peter Jackson, meanwhile, has held a press conference to herald the anniversary of production work on the film, at which the New Zealand director again assured fans of his project's loyalty to the books of JRR Tolkien. \"Way back at the beginning,\" he said, \"we thought there was quite a bit of this we are going to have to alter or change. But the more we got into it and the more we started to know the books in great detail, [the more] we've gone further and further back to the books. A lot of our so-called clever ideas at the beginning we've long since abandoned and Tolkien hopefully has a fairly clear voice in the film.\" The first film in the saga is released in December 2001.",

      "bodyText": "Brian Lara has been in Australia only 11 days, but already he has fitted in a year's worth of peaks and troughs. Badgered about match-fixing allegations before he stepped on the plane, then taunted for being overweight upon his arrival, yesterday he hit his second hundred in two innings to confirm he is still a force to be reckoned with. Lara's blazing 106 against a Northern Territory invitation XI in Alice Springs means he has now faced 218 balls on tour, scored 214 runs, hitting 13 fours and seven sixes. But it is still unclear just what shape Lara, still battling a hamstring injury, is in for next week's first Test in Brisbane. The NT attack boasted only two first-class bowlers, Colin Miller and Daniel Marsh, while Lara's first-up hundred was plundered off an ACB chairman's XI led by two old-timers in Mike Whitney and Jo Angel. Courtney Walsh began his tour yesterday where he left off in England, taking none for four from six overs as the tourists won by 57 runs. Sri Lanka, meanwhile, have left Aravinda de Silva out of next month's Test tour of South Africa, but the move has nothing to do with his inclusion in the Indian match-fixing report.",

The coach has never been here. So to undergo a three-Test series now, against one of the hottest sides in the game in their own environment, with a massive lack of experience in those conditions, represents a great challenge. On paper England have not got a prayer. </p> <p>Yesterday, however, Hussain outlined almost with relish what faces his side over the next four weeks. \"The first day will be a huge one for us,\" he said. \"But however it goes, whether it is in our favour or theirs, we will live in the present. There will be a long way to go. We lost the first day of the West Indies series and came out on top. </p> <p>\"I do regard it as our biggest challenge, however. This is completely different from anything we have had before, even on this tour where the pitches in the two warm-up games and especially that in Peshawar have been excellent. We have enough experience in our side to be able to adapt to whatever conditions there are but it will still be interesting to see how people cope with it.\" </p> <p>Hussain took another look at the Test pitch yesterday and it was already as dry as it could get, devoid of grass except for clippings rolled in cosmetically, cracked into a mosaic, and with no real solidity. There is no question that the ball will turn but the pace bowlers might also get some uneven bounce as the match wears on. The side that wins the toss will want to bat first. </p> <p>So balance will have been the key when England selected their final XI earlier this morning. The intention had been to play two spinners, with a batsman light from the seven who played last summer (Michael Vaughan's injury made a difficult choice unnecessary) and Darren Gough and Andy Caddick backed by Craig White, whose hamstring is still niggling but no more than it has done for the past five weeks. </p> <p>Andy Flintoff temporarily joined the injury list yesterday when he was hit on the nose after mistiming a hook in the nets, causing blood to stream down his face. X-rays showed he had sustained only bruising and the plan was that he would play if White, or any other batsman, proved unfit. </p> <p>Pakistan's intentions are clear. They had a vigorous workout in the morning (all, that is, except Inzamam-ul-Haq, who watched from an armchair for an hour before donning pads, batting like a prince for 15 minutes and resuming his seat) but well as the seamers ran in, they know this is for the twirlers. </p> <p>Pakistan may well play the side that contested the one-day series but with a batsman, Qaiser Abbas, who made 71 against England for the Patron's XI at Rawalpindi and took wickets with his left-arm spin, coming in for Azhar Mahmood. With Saqlain Mushtaq, Mushtaq Ahmed and Shahid Afridi, that might be seen as over-insurance, with the only pacemen intended to be Wasim Akram and Abdur Razzaq. </p> <p>\"It is a formidable side,\" Hussain admits. \"Just think of the questions they pose, when you first go in with men round the bat, or when Wasim is coming at you with the new ball. Think of their batsmen when they get in on a flat one and hit through the line of the ball. </p> <p>\"This is about our technique against the spinners and reverse swing, it's about having bottle when you are under the cosh and you don't know where the next run is coming from, or when you bowl a perfectly good ball and it goes for four.

She was snide, made personal comments about how I dressed, organised meetings without me and was generally difficult. I didn't have the confidence to confront her because I didn't think it was professional and thought she would win any arguments. I got my revenge when I got a new job. At my leaving bash I started taking the mickey out of her. I always thought she intimidated everyone, but because we had all had a few drinks, my colleagues started laughing. I spent the entire evening making her look ridiculous. She eventually flounced out and went home. It was pure joy. </p> <p> <strong> Rachel Riley, 29 </strong> management consultant </p> <p> A married male colleague was convinced I was having an affair and was hostile to me personally and professionally, even though I wasn't guilty of anything.

She was snide, made personal comments about how I dressed, organised meetings without me and was generally difficult. I didn't have the confidence to confront her because I didn't think it was professional and thought she would win any arguments. I got my revenge when I got a new job. At my leaving bash I started taking the mickey out of her. I always thought she intimidated everyone, but because we had all had a few drinks, my colleagues started laughing. I spent the entire evening making her look ridiculous. She eventually flounced out and went home. It was pure joy.

Echoing, churchy incantations became playful, almost jazzy melodies; hoarse and increasingly frantic hollerings were accompanied by Pohjonen pacing restlessly around the stage, as if trying to evade psychosis. </p> <p>He eventually achieved the unusual effect of making the accordion eat him. A battle with its aggressively pounding chords and whirling counter-rhythms left him thrashing around on his back, then slowly expanding the squeezebox in the half-light until it resembled a noisy giant caterpillar. He slowly retreated behind the instrument until only his legs were visible. Extraordinary. </p>",

Pohjonen bugs an orthodox accordion with pickups and pedals, beats it to make conga-drum sounds, or mimics the noise of avalanches of pebbles with his nails on the buttons. He sets loops of earlier effects going behind subsequent improvisations, as Eberhard Weber does with the bass. Folksy melodies and wistful tangos were swept into ever more balefully insistent ostinatos, sometimes gathering velocity and volume to turn into hurricanes of sheer noise, mingled with Pohjonen's amplified suckings and chewings into a head-microphone. Dolorous scat effects repeated like darkly lamenting north-European versions of the kind of vocal chants that Pat Metheny uses. Echoing, churchy incantations became playful, almost jazzy melodies; hoarse and increasingly frantic hollerings were accompanied by Pohjonen pacing restlessly around the stage, as if trying to evade psychosis. He eventually achieved the unusual effect of making the accordion eat him. A battle with its aggressively pounding chords and whirling counter-rhythms left him thrashing around on his back, then slowly expanding the squeezebox in the half-light until it resembled a noisy giant caterpillar. He slowly retreated behind the instrument until only his legs were visible. Extraordinary.",

Andy Goldsworthy arranges leaf circles in the artistic equivalent of children building sand castles. </p> <p>The tree house sculptor Auke de Vries has none of the exquisite decadence of Baudelaire. Yet when he thinks big, his grown-up experience achieves a viewpoint from which innocent wonderment seems again almost within reach. His Watchtower stands 11 metres high on the sloping hillside of the Yorkshire Sculpture Park. A skeletal metal tree leans precariously, topped by a little yellow house that stood out in perfect compliment to the drifting clouds. Crows flew by to check it out.

      "bodyText": "There are some artists who like to play at being kids. Charles Baudelaire saw creativity as childhood recovered at will. Andy Goldsworthy arranges leaf circles in the artistic equivalent of children building sand castles. The tree house sculptor Auke de Vries has none of the exquisite decadence of Baudelaire. Yet when he thinks big, his grown-up experience achieves a viewpoint from which innocent wonderment seems again almost within reach. His Watchtower stands 11 metres high on the sloping hillside of the Yorkshire Sculpture Park. A skeletal metal tree leans precariously, topped by a little yellow house that stood out in perfect compliment to the drifting clouds. Crows flew by to check it out.
