The London club set the sequence in motion a century ago this spring when they beat Sheffield United by 3-1 in a replayed final. </p> <p>Also in 1901, Tottenham played host to arguably the first international match involving a team from outside the British Isles - England 12, Germany 0 - which an upstaged Football Association at once pronounced \"unsanctioned and unofficial\" and said such a concept in the future was deemed \"unworkable for the obvious variety of administrative and logistical reasons\". It was not to sanction an \"official\" international for another seven years - Austria 1, England 6, Vienna, 1908, as part of preparations for that summer's Olympic Games competition in London. </p> <p>That pioneering international at Tottenham took place with football's structures scarcely formed. Only 10 years before, for instance, had referees been given exclusive powers to arbitrate, and penalty-kicks had been added to the laws. That same seminal year, 1891, had seen goal nets made compulsory. There also took place a crucial meeting in Sheffield between the fledgling Football League and its rival Football Alliance in which an elite \"Premier\" English league was almost formed. The proposal was a merger which would result in three national divisions of just 12 clubs each. After \"heated debate\" the idea was thrown out - in no time the first two divisions of the Football League had 40 clubs taking part, and it was not long till representation in the congested four divisions numbered over 90. </p> <p>Goal nets were \"invented\" by the go-ahead city engineer of Liverpool, JA Brodie. A year or two before, he had noticed in the local press an increasing number of dis putes concerning the validity of goals and had dashed off, apparently in less than half an hour, a choice of possible designs involving goalposts (the hitherto common taped \"crossbar\" had been banned by the FA in 1882 and three fixed pieces of wood made compulsory) with netting affixed, sent it off to the local patents office and, to all intents, forgotten all about it. </p> <p>The 1890-91 season began with a series of whinges over disputed scores by spectators and players alike, and before Christmas 1890 Brodie had a pair of nets made up. The Old Etonians' northern side agreed to use them for a game at their Liverpool ground in Stanley Park. </p> <p>The experiment was a palpable success and Brodie circulated the clubs. By January 1891, at Nottingham Forest's old pitch at Woodward's Field on the town side of Trent Bridge, Brodie had hung his two nets on the goalposts before a prestigious North v South fixture, and 110 Marches ago, the league agreed that nets should be compulsory by the start of the 1891-92 season \"when it was agreed with the patentee what price should be paid for the netting\". </p> <p>Certainly, they were billowingly installed at the Oval for the 1892 \"Brummie\" Cup final between West Bromwich Albion and Aston Villa - by which time, well pleased, Brodie continued with his day job at the council and settled down to engineering Britain's first dual carriageway, Liverpool's handsome Queen's Drive. He later helped design for the government the far more regally sumptuous New Delhi - but goal-nets will forever be his most notable memorial. </p> <p>Before 1891, referees in football were like today's new-fangled \"third umpire\" in Test cricket. Through the 1870s and 1880s clubs had been required to provide an umpire of their own and the two of them made all the decisions, halting play originally by waving a white handkerchief and, doubtless, bellowing - a whistle was only introduced in 1879 (again at Nottingham Forest). </p> <p>Before each kick-off, the two umpires were expected to appoint a touchline \"referee\" who could only make his defining decision if the two of them appealed to him to settle their own dispute. But in 1891, the role of the umpires was drastically diminished. They were banished to the touchlines, to be called \"line-men\", and it was the referee who was allowed to roam the pitch as \"sole arbiter\". </p> <p>I daresay the change only helped focus the increasing venom by crowds on to one man when his decisions went against their team, as this poignant letter by a referee to the correspondance columns of the Preston Standard that year testified. It followed the previous Saturday's match at Bolton between the local side and Preston North End: </p> <p>\"Dear Sir, Immediately the game had started I could see too much emnity all along the ranks of spectators for the match to be played in any amiable spirit as I found myself being cursed and sworn at by a body of dirty low blackguards, who stood at the goal and touchline nearest the entrance gates and threatened at once to smash my (adjective) jaw when the game was over.

They brandished their umbrellas at me, and voted me everything that was bad ...

      "body": "<p>Unless Coventry and Manchester City can string together an unlikely sequence of victories in the final weeks of the season, Everton are probably only one win away from Premiership safety. </p> <p>That is some cause for relief, given their inability to beat a Newcastle team so depleted that the manager Bobby Robson did not have a single defender to put on the bench. </p> <p>Robson told the former England captain Alan Shearer beforehand that he would have to switch to centre-half if one of the starting pair were injured. And with Everton's strikers so lacking in scoring form, he would doubtless have managed it standing on his head. </p> <p>It would have been amusing, though, to have seen Shearer arguing the case for the defence for once, having spent all game protesting to the referee David Elleray about the forwards' lot and the failure to award a penalty when he tangled with David Weir. </p> <p>Shearer was booked for following club instructions to stand in front of the ball to prevent opponents taking quick free-kicks, one such having caused Newcastle's defeat to Manchester City last week. And a player of lesser stature might have seen red for his protracted arguments over the late penalty that rescued Everton. Who does Shearer think he is?

      "bodyText": "Unless Coventry and Manchester City can string together an unlikely sequence of victories in the final weeks of the season, Everton are probably only one win away from Premiership safety. That is some cause for relief, given their inability to beat a Newcastle team so depleted that the manager Bobby Robson did not have a single defender to put on the bench. Robson told the former England captain Alan Shearer beforehand that he would have to switch to centre-half if one of the starting pair were injured. And with Everton's strikers so lacking in scoring form, he would doubtless have managed it standing on his head. It would have been amusing, though, to have seen Shearer arguing the case for the defence for once, having spent all game protesting to the referee David Elleray about the forwards' lot and the failure to award a penalty when he tangled with David Weir. Shearer was booked for following club instructions to stand in front of the ball to prevent opponents taking quick free-kicks, one such having caused Newcastle's defeat to Manchester City last week. And a player of lesser stature might have seen red for his protracted arguments over the late penalty that rescued Everton. Who does Shearer think he is? A Manchester United player? Robson said: \"He thought he should have had a penalty early on and then he began to get frustrated with the referee. It happens, but I suppose you are paid to suffer frustration.\" If Shearer really wants to understand the meaning of frustration, he should try standing in the shoes of Everton's manager Walter Smith, who once again saw his side miss outstanding chances to wrap up the game, finally leaving him relieved to salvage a point. Francis Jeffers, when he was fresh and hungry at the start of the season, would not have hesitated over his early chance, created by Thomas Gravesen and Kevin Campbell. But he struck his shot poorly and Shay Given made a comfortable save with his foot. Campbell missed another after Gary Naysmith courageously risked GBH from Andrew Griffin to get in his cross.

When Fulham beat them 2-1 in October Blackburn were 15th and struggling; since then they have lost twice and are surging inexorably upwards. </p> <p>So pleased is Graeme Souness, whose managerial career seemed close to ruin not so long ago, with this personal and professional change of fortune that he is busy handing second chances to, it seems, anyone who comes to his attention. </p> <p>On Saturday the marauding wing-play of Damien Duff was mirrored on the right by Keith Gillespie, who was starting his first game at home in more than 11 months. He might have considered his original exclusion somewhat harsh as his last match, against Sheffield United, was won 5-0. </p> <p>But consider the case of Eyal Berkovic, who completed 90 minutes for the first time since August - when he scored a hat-trick in Celtic's 7-0 win over Jeunesse Esch. </p> <p>\"It's an amazing turn-around,\" Gillespie said - of himself, rather than his team. \"I never thought I'd play for this club again and I was as amazed as anyone when the manager called me in and said he'd give me a second chance.

      "bodyText": "A season of comebacks in Blackburn looks increasingly likely to end with the club back in the Premiership after a two-year absence. When Fulham beat them 2-1 in October Blackburn were 15th and struggling; since then they have lost twice and are surging inexorably upwards. So pleased is Graeme Souness, whose managerial career seemed close to ruin not so long ago, with this personal and professional change of fortune that he is busy handing second chances to, it seems, anyone who comes to his attention. On Saturday the marauding wing-play of Damien Duff was mirrored on the right by Keith Gillespie, who was starting his first game at home in more than 11 months. He might have considered his original exclusion somewhat harsh as his last match, against Sheffield United, was won 5-0. But consider the case of Eyal Berkovic, who completed 90 minutes for the first time since August - when he scored a hat-trick in Celtic's 7-0 win over Jeunesse Esch. \"It's an amazing turn-around,\" Gillespie said - of himself, rather than his team. \"I never thought I'd play for this club again and I was as amazed as anyone when the manager called me in and said he'd give me a second chance. It was just a case of working hard and hoping something happens.\" A loan spell at Wigan made little difference and another month on the sidelines followed before his recent return. \"It was difficult. I've been used to first-team football for all my career so those four months were tough, but I've worked hard in training and seem to be getting the reward. \"But it's not easy when you've been out for as long as I have.

In a parallel life, the hero is a soldier in the 1917 Revolution; in the here and now, he's a patient in a psychiatric clinic, undergoing untrustworthy therapies. A worthy successor to Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita.</p> <p><strong>No Great Mischief by Alastair McLeod </strong> <br> In delicately poetic prose imbued with Gaelic cadences, McLeod examines the roots of the clans who fled Scotland for Cape Breton 200 years ago, but whose connection to their long-lost homeland remains profound.</p>",

The True History of Paradise by Margaret Cezair-Thompson Told from the perspectives of three women, this first novel from Jamaican-born Cezair-Thompson blends history and fiction in a tale of personal identity and family loyalties set against the backdrop of Jamaica's troubled political state in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Blackwater Lightship by Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn Shortlisted for the Booker Prize, this story of gay identity, Irish conservatism, family conflict and mortality is told in spare, bleak prose. Three generations of infighting women gather by the bedside of the favourite son, who is dying of Aids. Our Fathers by Andrew O'Hagan This grimly realist tale of Scotland, socialism and family conflict also made the Booker shortlist. The narrator must come to terms with the tragedy of his grandfather, once a social improver with grand dreams and now reduced to desolation. The Clay Machine-Gun by Victor Pelevin Manic satire from the brightest young star of Russian literature. In a parallel life, the hero is a soldier in the 1917 Revolution; in the here and now, he's a patient in a psychiatric clinic, undergoing untrustworthy therapies. A worthy successor to Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita. No Great Mischief by Alastair McLeod In delicately poetic prose imbued with Gaelic cadences, McLeod examines the roots of the clans who fled Scotland for Cape Breton 200 years ago, but whose connection to their long-lost homeland remains profound.",

It is understood ministers will again cite the 1998 report as support for their line that only pilot error, not a technical malfunction was behind the crash. This line has been consistently used by ministers and officials to dismiss a damning report, into the MoD's handling of the crash, by the public accounts committee last November. It accused the MoD of \"unwarrantable arrogance\", \"flawed logic\", and \"shocking\" aircraft test procedures. The Guardian has obtained a letter dated January 10 2001 from the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, to Virginia Bottomley, the constituency MP for the family of one of the pilots. Mr Hoon said: \"The [PAC] conclusions run contrary to those [of] the defence committee .. that \"there was no compelling evidence of fundamental flaws in the design of the Chinook or its components\". Mr Blunt, an adviser in the MoD at the time of the crash, told the Guardian: \"These statements are not true. We .. did not look into the crash but were concerned with the operation of the Chinook fleet now.\" Lord Chalfont said: \"A Lords committee is the only route left open to us.\"",

      "body": "<p>Matthew Taylor is a brisk, youngish man with gel in his cropped hair and a lean face that suggests austerity and purpose. He works in a tight top-floor set of offices with ink on the carpets, high above the chain cafes and raucousness of Covent Garden in central London. Until quite recently, as far as such things are measurable, he was probably New Labour's favourite intellectual. His father is the prominent left-leaning sociologist, Professor Laurie Taylor.</p> <p>During the mid-90s, Taylor junior ran the party's highly valued \"rapid rebuttal unit\", defending its new ideas from attack. From 1996 to 1998, as Labour's director of policy, he was in charge of coming up with more. In 1997, he helped write the general election manifesto. In 1998, he became head of the government's preferred think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research. Over a dozen of its employees have been recruited as advisers by Labour ministers. So, a few months ago, it seemed quite natural for Taylor to be asked to contribute to an important government project. With a new general election approaching, the prime minister was planning to write an article for Prospect magazine, laying out the philosophy behind Labour's next manifesto and, more generally, the party's fundamental aims and motives for being in office.</p> <p>Taylor assembled his thoughts. A decade of his increasingly critical writings about capitalism and Labour's need to define itself more confidently was distilled and conveyed to Downing Street. Then, just before the article's publication last month, an ominous email came back from one of Blair's close aides. \"It said: 'Sorry, the piece doesn't do justice to our discussions,'\" Taylor says, with a piercing look.</p> <p>This may have been an understatement. After almost four years in power, with the largest majority in Labour's history, and the Conservatives empty of rival ideas, all the prime minister had come up with was another cautious summary of the Third Way. Taylor is rather ruder about it: \"The ridiculous, fatuous claim that a mild form of Christian democracy represents a new politics . . .\"</p> <p>His smooth, media-ready voice rises with the disappointment. Without sounding terribly regretful, he adds: \"I've fucked my peerage.\"</p> <p>It may be hard for others to feel quite so enraged by the four brief pages of Third Way, Phase Two. Like the current government in general, the article is more thoughtful in tone and international in outlook than anything you can imagine John Major, for example, ever managing. The end of communism, the future of capitalism, the need for a new British diversity, the contradictions of modern conservatism - all of these are busily covered. Every development in recent world history, it is neatly implied, has led inexorably to the creation and success of New Labour. Any lawyer would appreciate the sly blending of fact and assertion, any management consultant the numbered paragraphs.</p> <p>But they numb you, after a while. The absolute certainty - Blair dismisses his critics for their \"negativism\" and \"self-mutilation\" in a couple of sentences - and the cool mist of political science jargon that settles on every sentiment are oddly alienating. There is nothing to stir any warm feelings of political attachment. \"An economically competent government\" with a \"sense of social justice\" is the wispy vision offered at the end. Interestingly, Prospect did not make the article its cover story.</p> <p>The truth is that New Labour, now it is mature and governing, feels a bit boring. And around it, British politics seems to have frozen. Election turnouts since 1997 have been uniformly low, and are expected to remain so. The opinion polls remain almost exactly where they were that spring, and were throughout the mid-90s, in fact, from the very moment Blair became Labour leader. Inflation and unemployment, the reliable enemies of every government in recent British history, are at their lowest for a quarter of a century. Even the Daily Telegraph, the rallying point for Labour's most diehard opponents, had to admit last month that \"Things Can't Get Any Better For Blair\". The slightly desperate enthusiasm with which the media has covered his government's relatively minor splits and scandals, and even tried to turn patches of severe weather into Labour \"crises\", has only served to make Blair look more impregnable.</p> <p>In a political system as volatile by design as Britain's is, this is close to unprecedented. The past few years, and probably the next few at least, constitute what more than a century of Labour activists have dreamed of during slow party meetings: \"a historic opportunity\". But, most of the time, you would never guess it. \"Government policy is all a bit itsy bitsy, and we can't see the red thread,\" one of Blair's most senior advisers confesses.</p> <p>Anthony King, professor of government at Essex University, is more robust: \"If you have a government that is not thought to be delivering, with an opposition that is not worth thinking about, then that's a recipe for apathy.\"</p> <p>Labour, from a leftish viewpoint, are not a bad administration - they have lowered the poor's taxes and raised their wages, rehabilitated public spending and rationalised Britain's pre-democratic constitution - yet somehow when ministers mention such things eyes begin to glaze over.</p> <p>Last Monday, this started to happen just as Blair reached the phrase \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\", three paragraphs into his latest big speech on law and order. The day had promised more. It was a fresh blue morning of the kind that blessed the 1997 Labour campaign. He was visiting an im maculate new community centre on Percy Circus, a pretty oval of council flats and private terraces in King's Cross, an area of London once considered seedy and ruined but now swamped with optimistic schemes for development.</p> <p>Blair's summary of Labour's 10-year plan for crime began confidently: not too heavy on the statistics and soundbites, quite sophisticated about the social context of criminals. But then, at the back of the long, warm room of pensioners and local worthies, the first pairs of eyes started to examine shoelaces. Other faces began to focus beyond the smiling grey-suited figure onstage, rattling off his lines about \"the end of fatalism\" and \"progress in stages\", on to distant rooftops and the clouds creeping up from south London. And, in their armchairs near the fire door, two elderly women with Scottish accents started talking between themselves quite audibly.</p> <p>There is growing discussion among British political thinkers about the sources of such indifference. King points to the continued fraying of public services under Labour. The historian Peter Hennessy blames the over- selling of government policies: \"They've had more visions than St Theresa.\" The think tank Demos perceives a current \"disengagement\" from party politics in almost all rich democracies. Everyone agrees about the dulling effect on all voters of an opposition as apparently hopeless as the Conservatives.</p> <p>Yet there may be less measurable factors, too. One is New Labour's philosophy about how to govern, its overwhelming faith in figures and targets. \"This is a hyper-rationalist generation of Labour politicians,\" says a Blair adviser. Even Taylor, in his world of policy seminars and filed periodicals, calls them \"a technocratic government\".

      "bodyText": "Matthew Taylor is a brisk, youngish man with gel in his cropped hair and a lean face that suggests austerity and purpose. He works in a tight top-floor set of offices with ink on the carpets, high above the chain cafes and raucousness of Covent Garden in central London. Until quite recently, as far as such things are measurable, he was probably New Labour's favourite intellectual. His father is the prominent left-leaning sociologist, Professor Laurie Taylor. During the mid-90s, Taylor junior ran the party's highly valued \"rapid rebuttal unit\", defending its new ideas from attack. From 1996 to 1998, as Labour's director of policy, he was in charge of coming up with more. In 1997, he helped write the general election manifesto. In 1998, he became head of the government's preferred think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research. Over a dozen of its employees have been recruited as advisers by Labour ministers. So, a few months ago, it seemed quite natural for Taylor to be asked to contribute to an important government project. With a new general election approaching, the prime minister was planning to write an article for Prospect magazine, laying out the philosophy behind Labour's next manifesto and, more generally, the party's fundamental aims and motives for being in office. Taylor assembled his thoughts. A decade of his increasingly critical writings about capitalism and Labour's need to define itself more confidently was distilled and conveyed to Downing Street. Then, just before the article's publication last month, an ominous email came back from one of Blair's close aides. \"It said: 'Sorry, the piece doesn't do justice to our discussions,'\" Taylor says, with a piercing look. This may have been an understatement. After almost four years in power, with the largest majority in Labour's history, and the Conservatives empty of rival ideas, all the prime minister had come up with was another cautious summary of the Third Way. Taylor is rather ruder about it: \"The ridiculous, fatuous claim that a mild form of Christian democracy represents a new politics . . .\" His smooth, media-ready voice rises with the disappointment. Without sounding terribly regretful, he adds: \"I've fucked my peerage.\" It may be hard for others to feel quite so enraged by the four brief pages of Third Way, Phase Two. Like the current government in general, the article is more thoughtful in tone and international in outlook than anything you can imagine John Major, for example, ever managing. The end of communism, the future of capitalism, the need for a new British diversity, the contradictions of modern conservatism - all of these are busily covered. Every development in recent world history, it is neatly implied, has led inexorably to the creation and success of New Labour. Any lawyer would appreciate the sly blending of fact and assertion, any management consultant the numbered paragraphs. But they numb you, after a while. The absolute certainty - Blair dismisses his critics for their \"negativism\" and \"self-mutilation\" in a couple of sentences - and the cool mist of political science jargon that settles on every sentiment are oddly alienating. There is nothing to stir any warm feelings of political attachment. \"An economically competent government\" with a \"sense of social justice\" is the wispy vision offered at the end. Interestingly, Prospect did not make the article its cover story. The truth is that New Labour, now it is mature and governing, feels a bit boring. And around it, British politics seems to have frozen. Election turnouts since 1997 have been uniformly low, and are expected to remain so. The opinion polls remain almost exactly where they were that spring, and were throughout the mid-90s, in fact, from the very moment Blair became Labour leader. Inflation and unemployment, the reliable enemies of every government in recent British history, are at their lowest for a quarter of a century. Even the Daily Telegraph, the rallying point for Labour's most diehard opponents, had to admit last month that \"Things Can't Get Any Better For Blair\". The slightly desperate enthusiasm with which the media has covered his government's relatively minor splits and scandals, and even tried to turn patches of severe weather into Labour \"crises\", has only served to make Blair look more impregnable. In a political system as volatile by design as Britain's is, this is close to unprecedented. The past few years, and probably the next few at least, constitute what more than a century of Labour activists have dreamed of during slow party meetings: \"a historic opportunity\". But, most of the time, you would never guess it. \"Government policy is all a bit itsy bitsy, and we can't see the red thread,\" one of Blair's most senior advisers confesses. Anthony King, professor of government at Essex University, is more robust: \"If you have a government that is not thought to be delivering, with an opposition that is not worth thinking about, then that's a recipe for apathy.\" Labour, from a leftish viewpoint, are not a bad administration - they have lowered the poor's taxes and raised their wages, rehabilitated public spending and rationalised Britain's pre-democratic constitution - yet somehow when ministers mention such things eyes begin to glaze over. Last Monday, this started to happen just as Blair reached the phrase \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\", three paragraphs into his latest big speech on law and order. The day had promised more. It was a fresh blue morning of the kind that blessed the 1997 Labour campaign. He was visiting an im maculate new community centre on Percy Circus, a pretty oval of council flats and private terraces in King's Cross, an area of London once considered seedy and ruined but now swamped with optimistic schemes for development. Blair's summary of Labour's 10-year plan for crime began confidently: not too heavy on the statistics and soundbites, quite sophisticated about the social context of criminals. But then, at the back of the long, warm room of pensioners and local worthies, the first pairs of eyes started to examine shoelaces. Other faces began to focus beyond the smiling grey-suited figure onstage, rattling off his lines about \"the end of fatalism\" and \"progress in stages\", on to distant rooftops and the clouds creeping up from south London. And, in their armchairs near the fire door, two elderly women with Scottish accents started talking between themselves quite audibly. There is growing discussion among British political thinkers about the sources of such indifference. King points to the continued fraying of public services under Labour. The historian Peter Hennessy blames the over- selling of government policies: \"They've had more visions than St Theresa.\" The think tank Demos perceives a current \"disengagement\" from party politics in almost all rich democracies. Everyone agrees about the dulling effect on all voters of an opposition as apparently hopeless as the Conservatives. Yet there may be less measurable factors, too. One is New Labour's philosophy about how to govern, its overwhelming faith in figures and targets. \"This is a hyper-rationalist generation of Labour politicians,\" says a Blair adviser. Even Taylor, in his world of policy seminars and filed periodicals, calls them \"a technocratic government\". There is some debate about whether this makes Labour old-fashioned, like white-coated experts from the 60s dispensing intricate predictions, or ultra-modern, like confident manage ment consultants. Either way, until last summer, there were 600 official targets for improvements to government services; when Taylor and others explained that this meant none of them could be \"priorities\", the number was reduced to a mere 200. The root of this over-earnestness, and perhaps also of our reasons for yawning at it, goes back far into the history of the Labour party, and in particular its previous attempts at government. In 1924, the party's first national administration managed nine nervous months in office before being smeared as Soviet sympathisers and ejected. In 1931, the second brief Labour regime was overwhelmed by the consequences of the Wall Street crash. Next, between 1945 and 1951, Attlee offered six whole years of famous melodrama: a sterling crisis, ministers dying, acrimonious battles over the new welfare state. Wilson suffered another currency collapse in 1966, Callaghan the Winter of Discontent.

Previously, first year students received \u00a37,450 (\u00a39,900 in London), with an additional \u00a3450 and \u00a3500 in years two and three. The announcement, following the council's review of research training policies, echoes similar moves by other government research councils. The government unveiled extra cash for PhD grants after the last Whitehall spending review to help recruit students. In some subject areas, universities and research institutes have found it difficult to attract graduates into research training careers. Once uniform across subject areas, PhD grants now vary considerably for different research councils. The increase in MRC grants will not be funded by a fall in the numbers of studentships \u00dc the number of new research studentships this year will remain the same at 365 PhDs and around 100 Masters. The MRC is also funding an extra 80 Masters degree studentships from 2003. The council supports the \"1 &amp; 3\" funding model for research students \u00dc postgraduates can spend a year researching for a Masters degree with the option to go onto a three year doctorate. High flyers can fast track onto a three year PhD. The council has also introduced a \u00a31m 'pre-doctoral fellowship' scheme which will allow 15 students to work in MRC units or institutes on a salary of around \u00a317,000 per annum dependant upon age and experience (plus location allowance in London). Applicants of any nationality can compete for these awards and the first 15 fellows will start work in October. Useful link the MRC website",

      "bodyText": "The car bomb that exploded outside the BBC's London headquarters at the weekend may have been a revenge attack for a Panorama investigation into the Omagh bomb, police said today. As Britain was placed on high alert for further terrorist attacks, Alan Fry, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said: \"It could be retaliation. I cannot ignore that possibility as being a motive for this attack.\" The Real IRA killed 29 people with a car bomb in Omagh in 1998, the single worst atrocity in 30 years of the Northern Ireland troubles, and Panorama named some of the members it claimed were involved in a programme last October. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the blast outside BBC Television Centre in Wood Lane, west London, early yesterday morning. However, as forensics continued a fingertip search of the scene, police said it was part of an ongoing campaign of \"murderous attacks\" by the Real IRA. Mr Fry said that one particularly worrying development was that it was becoming difficult to tell the difference between the Provisional IRA and the Real IRA \"on the ground\". He added: \"It is quite clear that we are dealing with ruthless terrorists who are prepared to use ruthless tactics without any care for the consequences of their actions.\" Police arrived at the BBC after two coded warnings were received, one at a London hospital and another at a charitable organisation, saying a bomb had been planted. Only the prompt action of the emergency services in evacuating the BBC building and nearby residents avoided certain death as the blast from 10-20lbs of high explosives damaged nearby buildings. Experts were trying to conduct a controlled explosion when the bomb detonated, leaving one railway worker with minor injuries. The device was packed inside a red taxi with a black roof - registration D902 GYH - that was parked outside the BBC main entrance on the wrong side of the road with its headlights on. It had been bought by a man who spoke with a Northern Irish accent from a dealer in Edmonton, north London, for \u00a3300 on Saturday morning. He was white, about 30 years old and 6ft tall, wearing a short jacket and baseball cap. Mr Fry asked the public to come forward if they saw the taxi, which did not have a Metropolitan Police license plate. He said: \"I know one witness believes they had an altercation with the driver of a red cab on Saturday evening. Did someone else meet someone who was less than friendly?\" Police want to speak to anyone who may have been in the Wood Green area between 10.30pm and 11pm to come forward and there is an information hotline on: 0800 789 321. Detectives are linking the blast to last year's bomb at Hammersmith Bridge, a device placed on a railway line at Acton and the rocket attack on the MI6 building at Vauxhall, London. Mr Fry could not say what type of high explosive was used in the attack but said it pointed to a disturbing growth of terrorist cells on the mainland. Urging the public to be vigilant, he said: \"Colleagues in the RUC would probably say the numbers are in the hundreds but growing, slowly but growing, and that is a worrying trend. \"It is evidence of their willingness through this campaign, despite the peace process, to bring their murderous attacks to the mainland and to London.\" Police could not rule out a connection between the BBC explosion and the blast at a Territorial Army barracks in London that blinded and maimed cadet Stephen Menary, 14, on February 21. A controlled explosion was carried out yesterday on a suspect vehicle near London's Victoria Station. Downing Street branded the BBC bombing a \"cowardly act\". A spokesman said: \"Those responsible can be in no doubt as to our determination to track them down and bring them to justice. \"There are those outside the peace process who are set on trying to turn the clock back to the days before the Good Friday agreement. \"So these actions may be designed to try to destabilise and frustrate the efforts of the government to secure the peace process,\" he said. David Trimble, the province's first minister, said he believed the Real IRA had targeted London because of recent failed attacks in Ebrington barracks in Londonderry and Claudy RUC station. Seamus Mallon, the deputy first minister, said: \"Those responsible for this attack have no role to play in the creation of a future free from violence and the hatred of the past.\" Brian Cowen, the Irish foreign minister, described the blast as \"the mindless act of people who have rejected all attempts to bring peace to these islands, and who have no alternative to offer, except misery and grief\". \u0095 A 29-year old man from Londonderry was due to appear in court today charged with offences under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, Essex Police said. A spokesman said there was nothing to connect the man to yesterday's attack on the BBC. Round-table talks to stabilise the Northern Ireland peace process are likely to take place later this week rather than tomorrow as anticipated, Stormont sources indicated today. The British and Irish governments and pro-Good Friday agreement parties are expected to hold a round-table meeting on Thursday in a bid to break the deadlock over policing, IRA decommissioning, British demilitarisation and Unionist sanctions against Sinn Fein.

Britain is becoming the new Switzerland, with the lowest debt and inflation, and the largest budget surplus, in Europe. </p> <p>Yet still the IMF and the European Commission are not satisfied - in part because they worry that Mr Brown's spending plans over the next three years will fritter away this strength, and in part because the IMF worries that the economy will buckle under the combined weight of private and public spending and reignite inflation - a warning it repeated last week. In particular, it worries that the build-up of capital investment will mean the government may have to borrow to finance capital spending, a position that Mr Brown explicitly permits in his definition of sound fiscal policy (the golden rule) but which offends the new conservative hawks in the US, who argue for permanent balanced budgets as part of their jihad against the state. </p> <p>The IMF is wrong.

      "byline": "Richard Williams",

      "body": "<p>The death of a track marshal on a sultry afternoon in the first week of a southern hemisphere autumn cast a shadow over yesterday's Australian grand prix, in which a flag-to-flag victory for Michael Schumacher's Ferrari carried the momentum that took him to last year's world championship into the opening race of the new season. The marshal was killed by flying debris in the wake of a high-speed accident between Ralf Schumacher, the champion's younger brother, and Jacques Villeneuve, both of whom emerged almost unscathed. </p> <p>However extensive the efforts to make it safe, motor racing will always be a dangerous business, and not only for the drivers who are rewarded so generously for risking their lives in the cause of sport and spectacle. Marshals are unpaid volunteers who give up their spare time to make it possible for others to compete for glory. At Monza last September one of their number was killed when a wheel came off Heinz-Harald Frentzen's Jordan during a five-car pile-up. Yesterday in Melbourne it was the turn of a 50-year-old Queenslander, his identity still guarded several hours after the end of the race. </p> <p>The two cars were running close together in sixth and seventh places as they approached turn three on the fifth of the race's 58 laps, with Villeneuve looking for an opportunity to force his BAR-Honda past Schumacher's Williams-BMW. Schumacher was in the middle of the track, with Villeneuve in line astern. Trying to guess his opponent's intention, Villeneuve moved his car to the outside of the track as they approached the right-hand turn at 175mph, only to discover that Schumacher was already applying the brakes. </p> <p>The BAR's right front wheel hit the left rear wheel of the Williams, slewing Schumacher into a spin and launching Villeneuve into a flight which sent him up and over his rival before crashing down against the barrier. All four wheels and the front and rear wings were ripped from the BAR as it hurtled along the concrete wall, topped with safety netting, which lines the outside of the track. One of the many pieces of debris - possibly one of the wheels - hit and killed the marshal, who was standing on the outside of the turn, close to an aperture cut in the wire netting through which warning flags are waved. Seven other spectators were treated on the spot for slight injuries, none requiring further treatment. </p> <p>In Schumacher's recollection, he had slowed normally. \"I was on the brakes and being careful not to make any change of line,\" he said afterwards, going on to suggest that Villeneuve had made a misjudgment similar to that which brought the pair into contact in Montreal last year. Visual evidence, however, appeared to support Villeneuve's belief that the German driver had begun the process of retardation slightly earlier than usual, by enough of a margin to make the accident unavoidable. </p> <p>So effectively are the drivers now protected that three of the weekend's accidents would probably have produced fatalities in the cockpit only six or seven years ago. Had improvements in the safety aspect of the cars not been ordered after the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at Imola in 1994, then Villeneuve, Luciano Burti and Michael Schumacher would all have been killed or crippled when their cars left the track at Albert Park at various times during the three-day meeting. </p> <p>As for the marshal, his death meant that signs of celebration were scarce in the pad dock last night. Few drivers need much encouragement to admit the debt they owe to the volunteers whose lives are at risk from the start to the finish of every race. Yesterday's winner was clearly upset by the news of the fatality, his sorrow shared by David Coulthard and Rubens Barrichello, who finished second and third. \"We have to look at how we can improve track safety for those people whose work enables us to go racing,\" Coulthard said. </p> <p>The safety car came out and ran at the head of the field for 10 laps, while debris was cleared away and the medics went about their work, but the accident happened early enough in the race to have no discernible effect on its outcome. </p> <p>This was the fifth grand prix in a row that Michael Schumacher has won from pole position, a statistic which will be preying on the minds of Ferrari's chief rivals. \"We had a better car than McLaren this weekend,\" Ross Brawn, the team's technical director, said, \"and what's pleasing is that we've got quite a lot of developments to come.\" </p> <p>So clear-cut was the reigning champion's victory on this fast parkland circuit that his final winning margin over Coulthard, a mere 1.7sec, gave no indication of the true gap between the relative performance of the two cars. </p> <p>Coulthard had a poor start, becoming entangled with Ralf Schumacher and the Jordan of Jarno Trulli in the run down to the first corner. The Scot recovered well enough to mount a respectable challenge, however, once Mika Hakkinen, his team-mate, had been forced out of second place when his front suspension failed just before half-distance, and Barrichello had slowed after an early brush with Frentzen put a front wheel of his Ferrari out of alignment. But the 10-second margin that lay between Schumacher and Coulthard after each had made his only pit stop gave the German a cushion which he was content to exploit over the final 15 laps, preserving his machinery while keeping a careful eye on the McLaren. </p> <p>The first race of the season contained no suggestion that any of the other nine teams will soon be in a position to mount a serious challenge to Ferrari and McLaren.

      "bodyText": "The death of a track marshal on a sultry afternoon in the first week of a southern hemisphere autumn cast a shadow over yesterday's Australian grand prix, in which a flag-to-flag victory for Michael Schumacher's Ferrari carried the momentum that took him to last year's world championship into the opening race of the new season. The marshal was killed by flying debris in the wake of a high-speed accident between Ralf Schumacher, the champion's younger brother, and Jacques Villeneuve, both of whom emerged almost unscathed. However extensive the efforts to make it safe, motor racing will always be a dangerous business, and not only for the drivers who are rewarded so generously for risking their lives in the cause of sport and spectacle. Marshals are unpaid volunteers who give up their spare time to make it possible for others to compete for glory. At Monza last September one of their number was killed when a wheel came off Heinz-Harald Frentzen's Jordan during a five-car pile-up. Yesterday in Melbourne it was the turn of a 50-year-old Queenslander, his identity still guarded several hours after the end of the race. The two cars were running close together in sixth and seventh places as they approached turn three on the fifth of the race's 58 laps, with Villeneuve looking for an opportunity to force his BAR-Honda past Schumacher's Williams-BMW. Schumacher was in the middle of the track, with Villeneuve in line astern. Trying to guess his opponent's intention, Villeneuve moved his car to the outside of the track as they approached the right-hand turn at 175mph, only to discover that Schumacher was already applying the brakes. The BAR's right front wheel hit the left rear wheel of the Williams, slewing Schumacher into a spin and launching Villeneuve into a flight which sent him up and over his rival before crashing down against the barrier. All four wheels and the front and rear wings were ripped from the BAR as it hurtled along the concrete wall, topped with safety netting, which lines the outside of the track. One of the many pieces of debris - possibly one of the wheels - hit and killed the marshal, who was standing on the outside of the turn, close to an aperture cut in the wire netting through which warning flags are waved. Seven other spectators were treated on the spot for slight injuries, none requiring further treatment. In Schumacher's recollection, he had slowed normally. \"I was on the brakes and being careful not to make any change of line,\" he said afterwards, going on to suggest that Villeneuve had made a misjudgment similar to that which brought the pair into contact in Montreal last year. Visual evidence, however, appeared to support Villeneuve's belief that the German driver had begun the process of retardation slightly earlier than usual, by enough of a margin to make the accident unavoidable. So effectively are the drivers now protected that three of the weekend's accidents would probably have produced fatalities in the cockpit only six or seven years ago. Had improvements in the safety aspect of the cars not been ordered after the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at Imola in 1994, then Villeneuve, Luciano Burti and Michael Schumacher would all have been killed or crippled when their cars left the track at Albert Park at various times during the three-day meeting. As for the marshal, his death meant that signs of celebration were scarce in the pad dock last night. Few drivers need much encouragement to admit the debt they owe to the volunteers whose lives are at risk from the start to the finish of every race. Yesterday's winner was clearly upset by the news of the fatality, his sorrow shared by David Coulthard and Rubens Barrichello, who finished second and third. \"We have to look at how we can improve track safety for those people whose work enables us to go racing,\" Coulthard said. The safety car came out and ran at the head of the field for 10 laps, while debris was cleared away and the medics went about their work, but the accident happened early enough in the race to have no discernible effect on its outcome. This was the fifth grand prix in a row that Michael Schumacher has won from pole position, a statistic which will be preying on the minds of Ferrari's chief rivals. \"We had a better car than McLaren this weekend,\" Ross Brawn, the team's technical director, said, \"and what's pleasing is that we've got quite a lot of developments to come.\" So clear-cut was the reigning champion's victory on this fast parkland circuit that his final winning margin over Coulthard, a mere 1.7sec, gave no indication of the true gap between the relative performance of the two cars. Coulthard had a poor start, becoming entangled with Ralf Schumacher and the Jordan of Jarno Trulli in the run down to the first corner. The Scot recovered well enough to mount a respectable challenge, however, once Mika Hakkinen, his team-mate, had been forced out of second place when his front suspension failed just before half-distance, and Barrichello had slowed after an early brush with Frentzen put a front wheel of his Ferrari out of alignment. But the 10-second margin that lay between Schumacher and Coulthard after each had made his only pit stop gave the German a cushion which he was content to exploit over the final 15 laps, preserving his machinery while keeping a careful eye on the McLaren. The first race of the season contained no suggestion that any of the other nine teams will soon be in a position to mount a serious challenge to Ferrari and McLaren. Olivier Panis, in his first race for BAR, finished in an apparently solid fourth place on the road, only to be given a 25-second penalty after the race for overtaking under a yellow flag, which moved him down to seventh in the standings. His misfortune brought joy to the Sauber team, giving fourth and sixth places to their young pair of Nick Heidfeld and Kimi Raikkonen, aged 23 and 21 respectively. Raikkonen, in only his 24th race since graduating from karts to cars, gave a remarkably assured display after making a poor start from 13th place on the grid. The young Finn ran consistently fast, made no mistakes, had the pleasure of overtaking Jean Alesi's Prost and the Benettons of Giancarlo Fisichella and Jenson Button, and was the last driver to finish on the same lap as the leader. Last year's prodigy, in sharp contrast, endured the most miserable day of his short and spectacular formula one career. A year ago in Melbourne Button was the star rookie, holding sixth place in his first grand prix until the engine of his Williams-BMW gave way. Yesterday his new Renault-engined Benetton showed itself to be down on power and deficient in handling qualities, and the Englishman's chances of making a respectable showing were further reduced when he was given a early 10-second stop-and-go penalty after race officials spotted that his mechanics had been late in leaving the grid before the parade lap. Juan Pablo Montoya, the 25-year-old Colombian driver who arrived from the US to take Button's seat in the Williams team, had worked his way up to fourth place during the pit stops, taking advantage of retirements and misfortunes, when his engine expired. The first round of a new war between tyre manufacturers went firmly the way of Bridgestone, whose clients filled the top six positions. Panis was the highest placed runner on equipment supplied by Michelin, making a return to formula one after a 16-year absence.

      "body": "<p>They're doing their nut in Barcelona. And not without reason. Sport described it as \"The Theft of the Century!\", maybe not the dramatic statement that was intended just two months into 2001, but you get the point. Likewise, El Mundo Deportivo's front cover screamed \"ROBO\" in enormous capitals and ironically reproduced one of the madridistas' chants: \"\u00a1As\u00ed, as\u00ed, as\u00ed gana el Madr\u00ed!\" (\"That's the way Madrid win!\")</p> <p>Bar\u00e7a president Joan Gaspart felt \"like I've had my wallet stolen\", while fellow director Gabriel Massfurroll sought to inflate the crime statistics: \"It's not just ours,\" he said, \"108,000 wallets have been robbed\".</p> <p>Rivaldo, meanwhile, sniffed something more sinister in the air. \"Somewhere there are vested interests who want Real Madrid to be champions,\" he announced, glancing across at the grassy knoll. El Mundo Deportivo's columnist Santi Noller has bought the Brazilian's story: \"This league championship already has an owner\" he alleged hysterically. \"Let's stop now to prevent any more heartache. Let them have their Liga!\"</p> <p>So, what's all the fuss about? It's that old Catalan favourite - bent refs in cahoots with Real Madrid. You see, on Saturday night Barcelona beat their eternal rivals 3-2 in the Bernab\u00e9u. Or at least, they thought they did, but their dramatic last-minute winner magically vanished with a wave of the linesman's flag; three Bar\u00e7a players were returning from an offside position (and hardly interfering with play) when Rivaldo's shot found its way past Iker Casillas.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, Bar\u00e7a's players went mental. Marc Overmars sprinted off the bench and got pelted by the Madrid fans as he shot down the wing past M\u00edchel Salgado (not for the first time) to have it out with the linesman. He was joined in battle by the rest of the side, apart from Rivaldo who just walked away smiling in disbelief. Things calmed down for a minute, literally, only to go off again at the final whistle - Pep Guardiola was pulled away from the ref by Madrid official Agust\u00edn Herrer\u00edn, who seemed to be quite enjoying himself.

      "bodyText": "They're doing their nut in Barcelona. And not without reason. Sport described it as \"The Theft of the Century!\", maybe not the dramatic statement that was intended just two months into 2001, but you get the point. Likewise, El Mundo Deportivo's front cover screamed \"ROBO\" in enormous capitals and ironically reproduced one of the madridistas' chants: \"\u00a1As\u00ed, as\u00ed, as\u00ed gana el Madr\u00ed!\" (\"That's the way Madrid win!\") Bar\u00e7a president Joan Gaspart felt \"like I've had my wallet stolen\", while fellow director Gabriel Massfurroll sought to inflate the crime statistics: \"It's not just ours,\" he said, \"108,000 wallets have been robbed\". Rivaldo, meanwhile, sniffed something more sinister in the air. \"Somewhere there are vested interests who want Real Madrid to be champions,\" he announced, glancing across at the grassy knoll. El Mundo Deportivo's columnist Santi Noller has bought the Brazilian's story: \"This league championship already has an owner\" he alleged hysterically. \"Let's stop now to prevent any more heartache. Let them have their Liga!\" So, what's all the fuss about? It's that old Catalan favourite - bent refs in cahoots with Real Madrid. You see, on Saturday night Barcelona beat their eternal rivals 3-2 in the Bernab\u00e9u. Or at least, they thought they did, but their dramatic last-minute winner magically vanished with a wave of the linesman's flag; three Bar\u00e7a players were returning from an offside position (and hardly interfering with play) when Rivaldo's shot found its way past Iker Casillas. Not surprisingly, Bar\u00e7a's players went mental. Marc Overmars sprinted off the bench and got pelted by the Madrid fans as he shot down the wing past M\u00edchel Salgado (not for the first time) to have it out with the linesman. He was joined in battle by the rest of the side, apart from Rivaldo who just walked away smiling in disbelief. Things calmed down for a minute, literally, only to go off again at the final whistle - Pep Guardiola was pulled away from the ref by Madrid official Agust\u00edn Herrer\u00edn, who seemed to be quite enjoying himself. (Funny that.) Barcelona had a point, but the suggestion that Saturday represented a return to the dark days of the Franco r\u00e9gime, when (sometimes) there really was something fishy going on, is a bit over the top - to say the least. It looked a very harsh decision and even the notoriously partisan Madrid press was on the Catalans' side - AS and Marca both admitted that the goal was \"perfectly legal\". One person who didn't agree - not publicly, at least - was the Man in the Moustache. The only person who's kept his copy of the little White Book, del Bosque conveniently declined to comment. \"If the ref didn't allow it, it's not a goal,\" he said, before playing the managers' Get Out of Jail Free card: \"From where I was I didn't see it.\" Anyway, referee Jos\u00e9 Losantos Omar wasn't the man at fault. Asked if the ref had cost Bar\u00e7a the game, Guardiola was adamant: \"No. The Linesman.\" And at least one Bar\u00e7a player had seen it coming, or so he claims. \"I remember looking at the linesman and thinking: 'He's too young to officiate a game like this'.\" said Michael Reiziger. Before the ninetieth-minute drama, there hadn't been as much fun as we'd hoped, despite some promising signs during the week. Madrid's proposed silent \"welcome\" never materialised for a start, possibly on the advice of the Man in the Moustache who admitted, \"If I was in the crowd, I'd whistle Bar\u00e7a\". Maybe the unfortunate comments of the Mayor of Madrid, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez del Manzano, also played a part. Manzano insisted that Madrid's fans should \"welcome the foreign team with respect\" - a Freudian slip from a Castilian centrist if ever their was one - and one which prompted Gaspart, clearly forgetting his own petrol-pouring role back in October, to go on the offensive again. \"No-one,\" he said, \"should tell fans what to do - not the Mayor of Madrid, not the president of Real Madrid, not the president of Barcelona,\" well, maybe him Joan, \"not even the Pope.\" The Corinthian spirit so lauded by Madrid's president Florentino P\u00e9rez did seem to have done a runner, albeit not to the extent decried by the more rabid members of the Catalan press, who either forgot what happened last time or thought, like Gaspart, that \"nothing happened last time\". A coach-load of Boixos Nois Ultras was pelted with stones and Bar\u00e7a's teenage keeper Jos\u00e9 Reina was punched by a Real Madrid fan when he went to retrieve the ball from behind the goal. The chasing pack falter As it turns out, the derbi result strengthened Real's position after Valencia drew 1-1 with Zaragoza and second-placed Deportivo lost 2-1 at Real Mallorca, the team with the best results against the big three: 10 points from twelve against Depor (twice) Madrid and Bar\u00e7a. With the Big Two to come in the next two weeks, Luis Aragon\u00e9s' side will have a big say in the title race, and might even grab a Champions League slot, having climbed to fifth above Villarreal, who lost 2-1 against M\u00e1laga on Sunday. Dario Silva smashed two emphatic finishes past Pedro Contreras, but the real highlights were the electronic advertising boards - which clicked round to ARCE half-way through the second half - and the kids in the Madrigal crowd who, despite their tender years, displayed a total mastery of an impressive array of repartee with which to welcome their opponents. And the ref, of course. Mid-table boring: just as well the bottom is exciting, then While there were mid-table 0-0 bores between Espanyol and Alav\u00e9s and Las Palmas and Atheltic Bilbao, things are really hotting-up down the bottom. John Benjamin's Real Sociedad picked up \"three wonderful points\" with a 2-0 win over Rayo Vallecano, but it wasn't enough to get them out the bottom three, thanks to Santander's unfortunate centre-back, Ramis - he scored an own goal as his side lost 1-0 to Numancia.

      "bodyText": "Labour and the Conservatives are struggling to secure poster sites for their pre-election campaigns because of a huge boom in poster advertising. Poster experts say the industry is enjoying unprecedented success in the run-up to a possible May general election. This is being fuelled partly by the political parties, but also by a recent spate of rebranding campaigns from the likes of Accenture - which until recently was known as Andersen Consulting - and the Post Office. Fears over the economy also mean advertisers are cutting back, making the relatively cheap medium of posters more attractive than TV advertising. According to poster-buying specialists Concord, less than 2% of so-called \"supersite\" billboards - those that carry 96-sheet posters - are still available in March. This compares with an average of 9% for this time of year. And in April just 1% of the market is free compared with a norm of 53%. The standard 48-sheet poster sites are also pretty booked up. In March, only 9% of sites are free compared with 19% at the same time last year. And in April, the figure is 11% compared with a 46% average over the last two years. The timing of the election - the government now looks almost certain to name May 3 - means voters will be bombarded with an intensive, four-week burst of advertising in the run-up to polling day. So congestion in April could be a problem. \"I think both the Conservatives and Labour have just about managed to book the number of sites they wanted but they have probably had to compromise on quality,\" said Concord managing director Nigel Mansell. \"A lot of the bigger advertisers are starting to cut back on television and if they start transferring their budgets to posters it doesn't take much to start clogging up the market.\" According to Concord research, Labour has little activity planned for this month but will launch a heavyweight (around 3,000 sites) 48-sheet poster campaign in April which will continue through to May. The Conservatives are planning a medium-weight (about 2,000 sites) 48-sheet poster campaign for the second two weeks of March, and a heavyweight 96-sheet campaign for the last two weeks in April. In previous elections the size of campaigns has not been an exact science. This is because companies that support one or other of the parties have booked billboards in their own names, only to transfer them to the party of their choice later on. But poster experts say this practice no longer exists. In the last month suspicions have been raised that Dixons boss Sir Stanley Kalms is about to throw some billboards into the Tories' campaign after he cashed shares in. But experts say the practice is largely obsolete. \"Nowadays you tend to find that once an election is called there is some last-minute bargaining for extra space. That wouldn't happen if they had poster bookings they could call on,\" said one. The size of the campaigns - roughly equivalent to that of a car launch - means both political parties are spending less than they did at the last election, when poster companies saw booking s of 5,000 sites from the two big parties. This is probably because of new restrictions on the amount of money political parties can spend on their election campaigns. Political parties focus on poster advertising because they are not allowed to use radio or television. Newspaper advertising tends to be used to target specific markets rather than the general public. On average, advertisers can expect to pay about \u00a3300 to run a 48-sheet poster for two weeks, plus a 20% agency commission, so a medium-weight 48-sheet campaign would cost around \u00a3720,000. The scarcity of 96-sheet sites - there are only around 3,000 in the country - means they can cost three or four times that. Supersites also tend to be in prime locations such as city centres, giving advertisers a double whammy effect. But both political parties could find themselves in trouble if a general election is not called for May, as planned. Advertisers that cancel their poster bookings are liable to pay 15% of the cost of the site if they cancel within two months and a whopping 90% if they pull their ads with just a month to go. If the foot and mouth crisis continues, leading to a postponement of the election, both parties could find themselves seriously out of pocket.

      "bodyText": "The bomb blast that rocked the BBC's White City headquarters at the weekend has caused major disruption to news programmes, with the whole of the corporation's new Stage Six news centre out of bounds and up to 1,000 journalists affected. Earlier in the day, BBC news bosses planned to move the One O'Clock News but in the event it was broadcast from its usual location. The backdrop of the newsroom - which was heavily damaged - was replaced. BBC drama facilities at Centre House were also disrupted, with many staff working from home. The BBC's two rolling news services, BBC News 24 and BBC World had to be combined for most of the Sunday. BBC bosses are playing down the disruption to services. A spokesman said that by Monday evening it would be \"business as usual\". But a thorough security review will follow the blast, which follows a series of recent security scares at the corporation. \"Whenever an incident like this happens, we review our security,\" said a BBC spokesman. Security was tightened two years ago following the death of Jill Dando. Staff not only had to show their ID, but their belonging were also checked before they were allowed through the turnstiles at TV centre. It was reviewed again four months later in September 1999 when a man got through security and ran amok at Stage Six, overturning computers and breaking glass. He ran through the newsroom screaming and waving a wooden club, leaving newsreader Anna Ford and up to 100 other journalists including royal correspondent Jennie Bond badly shaken. BBC bosses played down the latest incident, claiming that the only real damage had been to the front of the BBC building. \"The business of TV and radio is about having people coming and going through our doors. We depend on welcoming members of the public, and we have to balance the need for security with this,\" said a spokesman. Newspaper photographs graphically show how up to a dozen of the plate glass windows in TV centre were smashed in the blast. The bomb exploded at 00.20am on Sunday morning in front of the building in London's White City. Around 50 BBC staff had to be evacuated, but only one person - a London underground worker - is believed to have been hurt. Security forces believe the bomb was planted by dissident Irish republican group the Real IRA. It is believed the bomb could be a revenge attack by the group, prompted by the Panorama programme Who Bombed Omagh? which identified three men suspected to have planted the bomb which killed 29 people and two unborn children in 1998. John Ware, who researched and presented the programme, was unavailable for comment. The BBC refused to discuss whether additional security was to be provided for Mr Ware. who is believed to have been put under special protection ever since he made the award-winning documentary on the Omagh bomb.

      "bodyText": "BBC1's Irish drama Ballykissangel failed to turn around the channel's woeful Sunday night drama ratings, coming off second best against ITV stalwart Heartbeat. Ballykissangel had just 6m viewers and a 22% share, while Heartbeat pulled in more than double that audience, with 12.3m, according to unofficial overnights. BBC1 schedulers had tried to give the new series of the long-running drama a leg-up by putting the first episode right after the Phil Mitchell shooting in EastEnders on Thursday night. That got 7.7m, but even this bit of scheduling chicanery could not save the second instalment of Ballykissangel from a good drubbing in its 8.15pm Sunday night slot. The previous Sunday on BBC1 the last episode of Monarch of the Glen got 6.9m against Heartbeat. The final instalment of BBC1 three-parter Best of Both Worlds fared even worse than Ballykissangel from 9.05pm last night. It had 4.8m and a 19% share, against London's Burning on ITV, with 10.1m. But there was better ratings news elsewhere for BBC1 last week. The BBC1 Ten O'Clock News enjoyed its best week since ITV resurrected News at Ten. The BBC1 bulletin averaged 6.2m across the week, with viewing figures undoubtedly boosted by the worsening foot and mouth crisis and the Selby rail disaster. News at Ten averaged 5.5m between Monday and Thursday, while Friday night's ITV Weekend News, which goes out from 11pm, had just 2.6m. Overall, since News at Ten relaunched six weeks ago, the BBC1 Ten O'Clock News has averaged 5m; while the ITV late evening bulletin has averaged 5.1m. Ratings for Channel 5 reality game show The Mole picked up on Friday night from 8pm as the identity of the saboteur among the contestants was revealed. The Mole had 1.3m and a 5% share; compared with 0.8m the previous week. Channel 4 gave a terrestrial premiere to Michael Douglas thriller The Game on Sunday night from 10pm. The film took 2m and a 17% share.",

It gets an enormous amount of airtime, celebrity support (200 stars already this year) and press coverage.

Only a month ago, you wouldn\u00cdt have suspected it: a basic \"coming soon\" site with Henry inviting you to check out \"one of the most crucial websites around\" was all that was on show. Then on February 19, a handful of journalists were invited to the launch of a \"new interactive donation experience\", a live web event featuring Lenny Henry and Joanna Lumley, \"taking you through the steps leading to the galaxy of stars\" which boasts that it features the names of every person to make an online donation.</p> <p> The idea is immediate gratification for anyone donating any amount of money (although sadly, due to a \"software error\", my name won't be joining the likes of Michael Barrymore). The network infrastructure and transaction system, designed by Cisco with NatWest Streamline Merchant Services, can manage up to 200 consecutive donations a second and, amazingly, was built in just three weeks - compared to a traditional turnaround of two months. </p> <p>Kevin Cahill, Comic Relief\u00cds CEO, believes its new system will change the whole process of \"giving online\". \"The most exciting thing,\" he says, \"is that it gives Comic Relief the potential to reach the hearts and minds of people not just in the UK but throughout the world. It's a tangible way of helping Comic Relief tackle poverty and promote social justice in the UK and Africa, not just for Red Nose Day but on an ongoing basis.\" </p> <p>The internet has already opened up new avenues of fundraising in the charity sector.

The e-commerce solution also means that for the first time Comic Relief can sell noses, gimmicks, T-shirts and, significantly, two new Harry Potter adventures donated by JK Rowling, due for publication on March 12. </p> <p>\"For the first time, this means we had to think about designing the site for a global audience,\" says Horton-Mastin, \"and being able to handle 13 different currencies.\" </p> <p>But it's the good ideas in conjunction with the pride-and-joy payment systems which the organisers hope will make the campaign a success. Ideas like Pantasy Football (thought up by the lads at Cisco systems), an online game spoof of Fantasy Football launched on Valentine's Day with the Daily Star which allows wannabe football managers to create their dream team built from their 11 worst footballers, based on the performance of players in FA Cup, Premier League and Worthington Cup games. Entries start at \u00a32 with 80% of fees being donated by the production company Dream League. </p> <p>During the two day event itself (March 16-17), while the focus will be on televised events, Robbie Williams's \"Bid it sum\" live auction will be a strong contender for eyeballs. Game-as-ever Robbie, the nation's favourite cheeky chappie, is giving up his kingsize bed, Technics decks and a handwritten version of his hit single Angels to go under the hammer. The actual auction will take place at Sotheby's on April 10, highlighted at <a href=\"http://www.sothebys.com/robbie\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\">sothebys.com/robbie</a>, but bidding will take place on the official site and at <a href=\"http://www.robbiewilliams.com\" target=\"_NEW\">robbiewilliams.com</a>. </p> <p> Pop stars Westlife and Craig David have also hitched their fan sites up to the mother ship and will be offering free tickets and other paraphernalia.

According to reports, participants are rumoured to include Frank Skinner, Mariella Frostrup and Chris Evans, while Mel B has had to drop out due to exhaustion.

The \"Proceeds of Crime\" bill would establish a Criminal Assets Recovery Agency (CARA) which would have powers to investigate and remove assets such as cash and cars that it suspects have been acquired illegally. The proposals would give financial investigators greater powers than they have now, allowing them to take property at the start of a criminal investigation to avoid it being hidden or spent. Civil liberties campaigners have questioned the legislation, saying money and property should not be confiscated before someone has been proven guilty. Police chiefs have supplied the names of 39 alleged crime bosses who have assets of more than \u00a3200m between them and they want to follow the lead of the US, which raises millions of dollars every year by auctioning seized assets. Mr Straw said: \"Criminals are motivated by money and profit, and the fact that in many cases they appear to be 'untouchable', damages public confidence in the criminal justice system. \"Through a range of new measures, including civil recovery and taxation, we will target those individuals that benefit from crime, crippling their criminal enterprises and stripping them of the means to commit further offences. \"By removing the assets offenders have accumulated through criminality, we will deter others from following suit and send out a clear message to the public that nobody is beyond the reach of the law.\" If the bill goes ahead, the director of CARA will also be able to carry out tax functions - for example income tax, capital gains, corporation and inheritance taxes - for individuals, companies and partnerships if he has reasonable grounds to suspect that the money was derived from crime. Mr Straw announced money for CARA last July, setting aside a total of \u00a354m for the programme over the next three years.

The National Farmers' Union described the Dartmoor outbreak as a \"nightmare scenario\".</p> <p>The Duchy of Cornwall was \"very concerned\" about the outbreak at Dunna Bridge farm, near Two Bridges in the heart of the park, a Duchy spokesman said.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>Farmer's diary</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446494,00.html\">27.02.2001: A living on the edge</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446488,00.html\">05.03.2001: Dartmoor case raises 'nightmare scenario'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446483,00.html\">05.03.2001: 'All the cheaper cuts of meat have gone'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446563,00.html\">05.03.2001: Outbreak to spare Bank's blushes</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446500,00.html\">MP hits at safety on outbreak farm</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446594,00.html\">050.03.2001: Who's mad now?

      "bodyText": "Britain's livestock industry was today gearing up to start moving once again as farmers prepared to send thousands of animals for slaughter. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, said measures were now in place to start moving cattle, sheep and pigs from areas unaffected by foot-and-mouth to slaughter houses. Supermarkets welcomed the news and Safeway reported the crisis had led to an increase in demand for all food, although it denied an increase in sales of beef, lamb and pork of 70% amounted to panic buying. Special trips were being made by customers to buy meat and this had led to an increase in sales of all goods including pasta and cereals, Safeway said. Officials at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food spent the weekend receiving hundreds of applications for temporary movement licences which will allow some animals to enter the human food chain despite the ongoing nationwide ban on transporting livestock. Baroness Hayman, a junior agriculture minister, said 170 abattoirs had been approved for the scheme by yesterday evening, while one Scottish slaughterhouse in Banff started slaughtering animals yesterday. Hundreds of farmers have also applied for the licences, which will allow cattle and sheep to be sent to special holding areas before being slaughtered. \"The scheme is up and running and should be widely in practise by tomorrow,\" said Baroness Hayman. The chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, said the total number of outbreaks now stands at 70, with the latest confirmed case at a cattle and sheep farm in Bishop Auckland, Durham. He said a total of 14,092 animals had been slaughtered so far while another 60,000 will also be culled in a bid to halt the disease's rapid progress. The number of sheep affected is 62,306, while 10,493 cattle, 2,003 pigs and 13 goats have either been or are earmarked for slaughter. Mr Brown refused to rule out government intervention on livestock prices following speculation that farmers would fail to get a fair price for animals in the wake of the current crisis. Mr Brown said that the market may take some time to get back to normal, including prices to farmers. Mr Scudamore reiterated that the relaxation on the nationwide ban to allow some livestock movements would not spread disease as all animals would come from uninfected areas. \"The risk that these animals are incubating disease is pretty remote,\" he said. Meanwhile, fears were growing that thousands of farm animals on Dartmoor may have to be slaughtered after an outbreak of the disease on one of the Prince of Wales's Duchy of Cornwall farms. Around 46,000 cattle and sheep graze on the moor, which has already been declared a no-go area for walking, horse riding and other recreational uses. The National Farmers' Union described the Dartmoor outbreak as a \"nightmare scenario\". The Duchy of Cornwall was \"very concerned\" about the outbreak at Dunna Bridge farm, near Two Bridges in the heart of the park, a Duchy spokesman said. What's going on?

It would also be easy to take a shot at the journalists from outside,\" he said. The NUJ is requesting urgent talks with the BBC as it seeks further commitments on the safety of its members. The union warned that plans by the BBC to open more of its buildings to the public, when it moves to Broadcasting House in 2006, could also be dangerous. The blast follows security scares in 1999 following the death of BBC presenter Jill Dando and also after an intruder broke into the BBC newsroom later that year. The bomb, which exploded outside BBC Television Centre in the small hours of Sunday morning, is thought to have been planted by the Real IRA.

I love you all.\"</p> <p>The unbearable pain he was experiencing was evident in the extracts which, in his customary direct manner stated: \"Any chance of a little sedation? I feel a touch anxious. I want no more resuscitation. I can't take any more.\"</p> <p>Later, he wrote: \"Can you take me under to relieve the pain and waiting, please.\" It was underlined twice. Despite his continuing pain and the morphine-induced haze, Diamond, who had always insisted he was neither brave nor courageous, retained his humour and fortitude.</p> <p>When asked how he was feeling, he replied: \"Sort of OK, I suppose. Within the usual existential constraints.\" He also reserved a special thank you for the surgeon who had treated him after he had been diagnosed with cancer in 1997. He wrote: \"Peter, thank you for everything, you have given me a wonderful extra three years.\"</p> <p>Mr Lawson, editor of the Sunday Telegraph, went on to pay tribute to his brother-in-law's remarkable journalistic talent, as well as to his great kindness and warmth: \"John was a brilliant writer long before he was a famous writer,\" he said.</p> <p>Born in east London, in Hackney, Diamond's father was a biochemist, his mother an artist. He trained to be a teacher in English and drama and taught at a girls' school before switching to journalism. He met Nigella, his second wife, when they worked together at the Sunday Times, and they were married in Venice in 1992. It had been Diamond's unconditional love and support which had helped a shy, fragile Nigella to build up her confidence and self-belief, Mr Lawson added.</p> <p>More than a touch of humour was injected into the service by Diamond himself, when his columns were read in part by Neil Pearson, the actor who is to star in a BBC adaptation of the play based on Diamond's experience of cancer. Also addressing the congregation, which included many famous faces from showbusiness and the media, was his younger brother Matthew, who spoke of the great bond he had shared with a man who was \"kind, generous and brilliant\".</p> <p>Among those packed into the small crematorium were actor Alan Rickman, comedian David Baddiel, presenter Ruby Wax, writer Alan Coren, and Sasha Baron Cohen, better known as Ali G. Also present were Jon Snow, the newscaster, Alan Yentob, director of drama at the BBC, presenter Melvyn Bragg, and Elisabeth Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch's daughter.</p> <p>Matthew Diamond told them: \"I was lucky to have him as a friend. I was lucky to know him. I had him as my big brother. It was never dull.\"</p> <p>Nigella had once summed it all up perfectly, continued Matthew, when she told him \"I love a room with John in it\". Summing it up for those who will miss Diamond, he added: \"A lot of rooms we will have to love a little less, but we will never stop loving John.\"</p>",

Within the usual existential constraints.\" He also reserved a special thank you for the surgeon who had treated him after he had been diagnosed with cancer in 1997. He wrote: \"Peter, thank you for everything, you have given me a wonderful extra three years.\" Mr Lawson, editor of the Sunday Telegraph, went on to pay tribute to his brother-in-law's remarkable journalistic talent, as well as to his great kindness and warmth: \"John was a brilliant writer long before he was a famous writer,\" he said. Born in east London, in Hackney, Diamond's father was a biochemist, his mother an artist. He trained to be a teacher in English and drama and taught at a girls' school before switching to journalism. He met Nigella, his second wife, when they worked together at the Sunday Times, and they were married in Venice in 1992. It had been Diamond's unconditional love and support which had helped a shy, fragile Nigella to build up her confidence and self-belief, Mr Lawson added. More than a touch of humour was injected into the service by Diamond himself, when his columns were read in part by Neil Pearson, the actor who is to star in a BBC adaptation of the play based on Diamond's experience of cancer. Also addressing the congregation, which included many famous faces from showbusiness and the media, was his younger brother Matthew, who spoke of the great bond he had shared with a man who was \"kind, generous and brilliant\". Among those packed into the small crematorium were actor Alan Rickman, comedian David Baddiel, presenter Ruby Wax, writer Alan Coren, and Sasha Baron Cohen, better known as Ali G. Also present were Jon Snow, the newscaster, Alan Yentob, director of drama at the BBC, presenter Melvyn Bragg, and Elisabeth Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch's daughter. Matthew Diamond told them: \"I was lucky to have him as a friend. I was lucky to know him. I had him as my big brother. It was never dull.\" Nigella had once summed it all up perfectly, continued Matthew, when she told him \"I love a room with John in it\". Summing it up for those who will miss Diamond, he added: \"A lot of rooms we will have to love a little less, but we will never stop loving John.\"",

      "bodyText": "Frustrated by the poor performance of the ubiquitous banner advert, the consumer products giant Unilever is planning to put its TV commercials on the internet. The firm has designed a pilot project to show whether punters will stay logged on for long enough to watch a 30-second advert. For the project, Unilever has hired a US internet company to put a campaign for its Salon Selectives haircare products on key internet portals. The campaign will make its internet debut in May at the same time as it breaks on TV. Web surfers will be wooed with incentives such as promotions and prizes to keep them watching for the duration of the commercial. Unilever has already experimented with showing its commercials on the web as part of a deal with the internet company Excite@Home. But whereas that required users to have access to broadband technology, the new arrangement will allow people to watch the adverts using a standard internet connection. Unilever spends about \u00a32.5bn a year to promote its 970 brands on worldwide TV. Broadcasting its adverts on the internet would be a much cheaper way of getting them seen by an international audience. Related story Feb 9: Unilever pioneers interactive adverts on TV",

When it was released it was branded sickening, gruesome, hateful and even blamed for mysterious deaths. Now, 28 years after it was released under a strict X certificate, television viewers will have the chance to decide whether the Exorcist deserves its reputation. It will appear on British terrestrial television for the first time on Channel 4. The 1973 shocker about a young girl who becomes possessed by the devil, which was denied a video certificate in the UK until 1999, is being scheduled for Saturday March 17. \"The film is considered by many to be a classic of the horror genre,\" said a Channel 4 spokesman. \"It's notoriety precedes it and we are keen that viewers have a chance to decide for themselves.\" The Exorcist, which has an 18 certificate, will be scheduled at 10.50pm. It will be preceded by a short commentary by film critic and broadcaster Mark Kermode. An Independent Television Commission spokeswoman said the regulator had no problem with Channel 4 showing the Exorcist, \"provided the film has a certificate and is scheduled appropriately\". She said listings information and on-air trailers and warnings had an important role to play in alerting viewers to the film's content. \"Viewers are more likely to be offended if they are taken by surprise,\" she said. When the Exorcist was rereleased in cinemas last year it attracted huge audiences for late-night showings, without any ill effects. A statement from the British Board of Film Classification said: \"The film was originally given an X certificate in 1974 and has been widely shown ever since. \"In the 1970s, however, incidents of hysteria involving young women led to some concern the film might cause severe emotional problems, particularly among those who believed in the reality of demonic possession.\" The film fell foul of the Video Recordings Act in the 1980s and was denied a video certificate for more than a decade. It finally received an 18 certificate from the British Board of Film Classification in 1999. Channel 4 is also planning to give a terrestrial TV premiere to another controversial film, the Story of O, on Sunday March 18. The Story of O tells of the sexual humiliation of a girl at the hands of a group of Parisian dilettantes and became a cause celebre when banned in the 1970s. The censor considered it sadistic, while others defended it as an indictment of cruelty. It was finally passed uncut by the BBFC last year. The Channel 4 spokesman said transmission of the film had yet to be confirmed, as the broadcaster's lawyers were examining its content. \"There are some potential legal issues because it features sexual scenes and we have to make sure they take place in the context of consensual sex,\" he said.",

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Where Saints are at</strong></p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Where Saints are at</strong></p> <p>Somewhere in the middle, with a rock on the left and a hard place on the right. Basically, you can never, ever, really know where you stand with Saints. One minute you're the laughing stock of the Premiership, losing to a team bottom of the First Division after being 3-0 up with 45 minutes to go. The next, you're pulling off an impressive away win against a Boro side unbeaten under Terry Venables. It's a rollercoaster ride, and you never know where you're going. Which for a rollercoaster is pretty hairy. </p> <p><strong>What makes us so different</strong></p> <p>What makes Southampton different to other clubs? Well, we play in the glamorous world of the Premiership, yet we're probably the least glamorous club you'll come up against. We play in a ground that takes you on a time warp back to the fifties, where you can smell the mixture of Brylcreem and Ralgex. We're a rarity in the Premier League: a small club swimming with sharks, feeding on plankton. As to whether we'll retain our charm in our new ground is the challenge we aim to succeed at.</p> <p><strong>The high points</strong></p> <p>An easy question to answer: beating the mighty Manchester United three years on the trot. Beating them 3-1 and having them blame it on their grey strip, beating them 6-3 and having them blame it on Roy Keane being sent off, bBeating them 1-0 and have them blame it on a full moon in the house of Scorpio. </p> <p>Of course, beating Pompey 3-0 in 1996 was a high, an atmosphere that no Premiership opponent can generate. And perhaps surviving against all odds in 1999, what a ride that season was.</p> <p> <strong>The low points</strong></p> <p>I wasn't able to make our 1988 defeat to Pompey, I would imagine that would be the worst defeat at the Dell. For me personally, losing 6-2 and 7-2 to Spurs was poor, as was the match in the 1998/99 season when we were trailing 3-1 at home to Blackburn. At that moment I swore we were going down. A miraculous recovery to draw 3-3, which spurred us to go on and survive, pretty much erased that pain.</p> <p><strong>Current position</strong></p> <p>At the moment Saints are flying high, playing good passing football and looking a good outside bet for Europe. It's been so long since Saints were in Europe, several countries don't exist anymore. Is Russia still a superpower? It was when I last went to Europe with Saints.</p> <p> <strong>Our last fixture</strong></p> <p> Manchester City away. According to Joe Royle, we got lucky, committed a smash-and-grab, scored a goal against the run of play on a bobbly pitch and cheated City with a \"blatant\" penalty. It would be nice if someone actually remembered that sound defending is actually part of the game.</p> <p><strong>Our next fixtures</strong></p> <p>Everton at home, then Ipswich. God only knows how, but if we win those two games we could actually go third! How on earth can that happen? From relegation strugglers to European wannabes. If anything, the Tranmere game might just have done us a favour. With games like that you either sink or swim, and we're swimming along very well thank you. It might even have made our season. </p> <p><strong>Sore point</strong></p> <p>As a whole the board aren't that bad, and Saints are financially better off. But if I was to have one gripe, it would have to be the rise in prices for children in the new stadium.

      "bodyText": "Where Saints are at Somewhere in the middle, with a rock on the left and a hard place on the right. Basically, you can never, ever, really know where you stand with Saints. One minute you're the laughing stock of the Premiership, losing to a team bottom of the First Division after being 3-0 up with 45 minutes to go. The next, you're pulling off an impressive away win against a Boro side unbeaten under Terry Venables. It's a rollercoaster ride, and you never know where you're going. Which for a rollercoaster is pretty hairy. What makes us so different What makes Southampton different to other clubs? Well, we play in the glamorous world of the Premiership, yet we're probably the least glamorous club you'll come up against. We play in a ground that takes you on a time warp back to the fifties, where you can smell the mixture of Brylcreem and Ralgex. We're a rarity in the Premier League: a small club swimming with sharks, feeding on plankton. As to whether we'll retain our charm in our new ground is the challenge we aim to succeed at. The high points An easy question to answer: beating the mighty Manchester United three years on the trot. Beating them 3-1 and having them blame it on their grey strip, beating them 6-3 and having them blame it on Roy Keane being sent off, bBeating them 1-0 and have them blame it on a full moon in the house of Scorpio. Of course, beating Pompey 3-0 in 1996 was a high, an atmosphere that no Premiership opponent can generate. And perhaps surviving against all odds in 1999, what a ride that season was. The low points I wasn't able to make our 1988 defeat to Pompey, I would imagine that would be the worst defeat at the Dell. For me personally, losing 6-2 and 7-2 to Spurs was poor, as was the match in the 1998/99 season when we were trailing 3-1 at home to Blackburn. At that moment I swore we were going down. A miraculous recovery to draw 3-3, which spurred us to go on and survive, pretty much erased that pain. Current position At the moment Saints are flying high, playing good passing football and looking a good outside bet for Europe. It's been so long since Saints were in Europe, several countries don't exist anymore. Is Russia still a superpower? It was when I last went to Europe with Saints. Our last fixture Manchester City away. According to Joe Royle, we got lucky, committed a smash-and-grab, scored a goal against the run of play on a bobbly pitch and cheated City with a \"blatant\" penalty. It would be nice if someone actually remembered that sound defending is actually part of the game. Our next fixtures Everton at home, then Ipswich. God only knows how, but if we win those two games we could actually go third! How on earth can that happen? From relegation strugglers to European wannabes. If anything, the Tranmere game might just have done us a favour. With games like that you either sink or swim, and we're swimming along very well thank you. It might even have made our season. Sore point As a whole the board aren't that bad, and Saints are financially better off. But if I was to have one gripe, it would have to be the rise in prices for children in the new stadium. Children now face a massive hike in prices once they become \"teenagers\". The chairman After a shaky start, Rupert Lowe has come good, producing the new stadium and a club that is financially secure. He's also mature enough to actually talk to the fans. Rivals Pompey, but as rivals go they are piss-poor. Stuck in a time warp since the fifties, they constantly berate us for not having a glorious past like they had (ie: two championships, one FA Cup and nothing for the next 50 years). Three wins against us in the last 50 years, they still harp on about beating us in 1988. They named a fanzine after it. Kit I quite like the last one, though the one lined up for next season is a back-to-stripes basic. The worst one? The BLUE away kit, from about ten years ago. We looked like Pompey. Most ridiculous piece of merchandise A Nationwide Review CD-Rom. Just what interest is that to us? Heroes Currently, Dean Richards. The man is made of stone and only a fool wouldn't play him for England. The most popular ever? Le Tiss, quite simply the best player I've ever seen. As for other teams? I'd have to say Michael Owen, the boy is a credit to his club and country. When he's on his feet that is. Villians Club villain? I don't think so. We love all our players.

      "bodyText": "A leading contender to succeed the Pope has been accused of medieval mumbo-jumbo after publishing 10 rules on how to resist Satan's temptations. Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi, 66, the archbishop of Genoa, dedicated his lenten letter to combating the fascination of a devil who is charming, shrewd and very real. Those who follow his 10-step programme are promised the ability to rebuff offers of forbidden fruit, unlike Adam and Eve. First rule: \"Do not forget that the devil exists.\" Rule two: \"Do not forget that the devil is a tempter.\" Rule three: \"Do not forget that the devil is very intelligent and astute.\" Cardinal Tettamanzi, widely seen as a conservative frontrunner to succeed the Pope, urges permanent watchfulness. \"Be vigilant in the eyes and the heart. Be strong in spirit and virtue.\" Another five rules recommend tireless prayer, adoring God, listening to His words, remembering Christ's victory over temptation and man's sharing in that victory. Obeying the tenth rule, though, should seal the devil's defeat: \"Be humble and love mortification.\" Cardinal Tettamanzi is a moral theologian who has helped the Pope write encyclicals. The pastoral letter raised his profile as the candidates jockey to replace the ailing pontiff, 81 in May. The Milan-based Theological Studies Centre, which is independent of the Vatican, condemned the letter for bringing Satan back into the realm of human responsibility. By raising the spectre of diabolical machinations rather than human evil, the cardinal was reaching back into the middle ages and ignoring scientific advances in psychology, the centre claimed. \"To attribute guilt to the devil could encourage people to be irresponsible,\" it said. According to La Repubblica, the centre also accused the church of having exploited Satan in centuries past to persecute heretics and cultural minorities, such as gays. In recent decades, the role of the devil has become a fraught topic in theology, splitting those who believe he is real and those who believe he symbolises mankind's capacity for evil. Also known as Lucifer and Beelzebub, according to the Bible he is a fallen angel who sinned by pride and was banished from heaven. He is allowed by God to exercise influence on living and inanimate creatures - tempting Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and Jesus in the wilderness. The Italian Bishops Conference has recently agonised about how to address the devil during exorcisms following a Vatican decision to translate into Italian the venerable Latin formula, Vade retro Satanas. Bishops were unsure which form of \"you\" to use - the familiar \"tu\" or formal \"lei\".",

Nearly 200 bookshops in high streets or suburbs have been killed by pressures including the explosion of price cuts on bestsellers by chains like WH Smith, Waterstone's and superstores, savage rent rises, and the internet. The shops - seen until recently as integral to the heart and soul of British cultural life - fell in number from 1,894 in 1995 to 1,699 last year, a drop of 195. The Booksellers Association issued the figures, which have not been announced before, after checking its membership records. It did so after being asked to shed light on a report in the Book Sales Yearbook showing that independent bookshops lost nearly 10% of the total book sales market last year. The closures were the main reason for this, it emerged. \"It has been a different industry in the last five years - much tougher,\" Tim Godfray, association chief executive, said yesterday. Rent rises, which are squeezing all high street shops, have provoked the association to try to open talks with the government through the British Retail Consortium in an effort to reverse a contractual condition that reviews of shop rents can only be upwards. \"The idea is to get the government to introduce legislation or a new code of practice\", Mr Godfray said. Warnings of dire effects on small bookshops were dismissed in 1995 when the book trade's net book agreement collapsed under pressure from big publishers and book chains. The agreement, the last price-fixing measure left in British commerce, prevented big chains from using their financial clout to drive out street-corner shops by offering cut-price bestsellers. Many small shops depended on revenue from the Christmas top sellers like Delia Smith's cookery series to stay in business. The death of the agreement left them unable to match the chain discounts. The 2001 Book Sales Yearbook shows that, six years later, the only outlets selling more books are superstores, book clubs through aggressive marketing, and internet bookshops like Amazon.

These areas needed more business start-ups and increased private sector investment, he said, and the government would present a range of new incentives to encourage both. This means the Budget could include a package of targeted tax breaks, which Mr Brown said he would be consulting on in the run-up to this year's announcement. They include: \u0095 Cuts in stamp duty. November's pre-Budget report said the government would abolish this tax for all property transactions in the country's most deprived areas to stimulate the property market and encourage urban renewal. \u0095 Reduced business rates. A proposal suggested in last year's local government finance green paper that would cut overheads for small businesses throughout England. \u0095 Changes in capital gains tax. The Treasury has yet to release details of what these might be, but they will probably allow businesses to keep more of the profits from long-term investments in deprived areas. Ultimately, Mr Brown hopes these measures will lead to an extra \u00a31bn of private investment making its way into high unemployment areas of the country. With the chancellor and trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers convinced of the need to realise the economic potential of the English regions, Mr Brown might also unveil extra allowances and incentives to support this. The package could include a range of new freedoms for the regional development agencies to spend their funding, a move trailed in the pre-Budget report. That report included several other regeneration measures due to be carried through to this year's announcement. Among them were: \u0095 Accelerated tax credits for cleaning up contaminated land. Aimed at encouraging land recycling by providing immediate tax relief for property investors' clean-up costs. Businesspeople will no longer have to wait until they sell to reap the tax rewards. \u0095 Immediate tax relief for converting redundant space above shops into flats. Aimed at making better use of urban space and bringing more life into commercial areas. \u0095 Reduced VAT on converting residential properties into flats. A 5% rate aimed at creating more homes in areas of high demand. \u0095 Zero VAT on renovating residential property empty for 10 years or more. Designed to encourage investors to bring derelict properties back onto the market. The new VAT rates will be welcomed by social housing professionals, but bodies such as the Chartered Institute of Housing want to see the measures go further, and are hoping the chancellor will equalise the rates for building new properties and refurbishing old ones. At present, new buildings attract no VAT, while refurbishment is charged at the full rate, a policy that flies in the face of the government's plans for urban renewal by discouraging the recycling of old homes and business premises. The equalised rate could be 5% or 7.5% for both types of work. Mr Brown will probably have little to say about local government - councils have already had their finance settlement, with ministers delivering a funding increase of more than 7% plus an extra \u00a3190m to help keep down council tax levels. Mr Brown can choose to add money in, and if he does decide to hand out funds from his pre-election war chest, some of it could end up in town and county hall coffers. But the chancellor has set his face against \"irresponsible pre-election giveaways\", and promised to use this budget to lock in tough public sector spending rules, making any significant financial boost unlikely.",

      "bodyText": "Financial Times owner Pearson is to cut back the internet spending which has eaten into the group's profits. The UK media group reported a fall in its full-year figures after spending nearly \u00a3200m on internet projects last year. But Pearson moved to ease City jitters over the damage to its top line by promising that the cost of developing its online education sites and putting the FT on the web will \"decline significantly in 2001\". The group has joined the likes of Emap, United Business Media and Reuters in ploughing a significant amount of its capital into the internet. As a result, pre-tax profits for last year fell 17% to \u00a3333m, although sales rose 16% to \u00a33.8bn. \"This is another great set of results,\" said Pearson chief executive Marjorie Scardino. \"All the time, we are making the moves that enable Pearson to grow more quickly and more profitably,\" she said. The Financial Times offset fears of a downturn in the financial advertising market by posting a 45% rise in operating profit to \u00a381m. However, Pearson admitted advertising growth had slumped from 34% last year to just 8% in the first two months of this year. The education market is by far Pearson's biggest earner, contributing just over \u00a32bn in turnover, with the FT group next on \u00a3800m. Analysts will be eagerly awaiting US president Bush's education spending plans in the US. Any rise in the budget will be a significant boost to Pearson's strong presence across the Atlantic. The Financial Times Group is also teaming up with mobile phone retailer Carphone Warehouse to launch a \"virtual\" mobile phone network. The service, which will launch in the spring, will offer business and financial content to consumers.

      "body": "<p>In Giuseppe Tornatore's new film, Malena, the Italian actress Monica Bellucci plays a heroine who is every man's dream and every woman's nightmare. The young and gorgeous Malena Scordia, who is marooned in her husband's village in Sicily when he goes off to the second world war, is an unwitting Circe, driving men to lust and their wives to plot revenge. Walking across the village square, Bellucci, with her sinuous curves and inimitable hauteur, evokes a grand tradition of Italian screen goddess: part siren, part muse and all trouble. </p> <p>But she does not remain simply a glorious icon in the film. She also creates a subtle, wrenching portrait of a woman victimised by the society in which she lives as she struggles to maintain her dignity. \"For me, Malena is a product of her era, in that she can't have an identity apart from men,\" Bellucci says. She smiles ruefully. \"While I, of course, as a product of my era, have fought all my life to be free and independent.\" </p> <p>It's a mark of Bellucci's talent that she has managed to incarnate a woman so different from herself. Bellucci, 29, began her professional life as a fashion model but has found wider celebrity in Europe as an actress, thanks to her striking presence in about a dozen Italian and French films, including two high-profile projects in France, L'Appartement (1996) and Dobermann (1997). </p> <p>Her first English-language starring role came last year in Under Suspicion, in which she appeared opposite Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman. In both that film and Malena, Bellucci plays enigmatic, alluring women who convey more with a glance than most people do with a diatribe. \"Monica is mysterious: behind her beauty, there is a world you want to know,\" says Tornatore of his star. \"But unlike so many beautiful women, she doesn't think her beauty is everything. She is intelligent and lends herself to the work in an extraordinary way, without limits.\" </p> <p>In person, Bellucci speaks fluent English (she also speaks French) and comes across as warm, voluble and unpretentious. Recalling how she and Tornatore discussed Malena's inner life in each scene of the film, she says: \"Because my character doesn't speak very much, I needed to show everything through my face and my body. It was as if we had a secret script, Giuseppe and I, where in each scene I had a big monologue in my mind.\" </p> <p>Malena's story is revealed through the eyes of a 13-year-old boy (Giuseppe Sulfaro), who is captivated by her. He observes helplessly as her life unravels following her husband's death in the war. Alone and unable to find work, the young widow half-defiantly, half-desperately becomes a prostitute for the village's German occupiers. </p> <p>Tornatore's evocation of Bellucci's charms doesn't prepare the viewer for the film's central scene, in which Malena is set upon by the village's jealous wives, who beat her and cut off her hair - a fate shared by many collaborating women at the end of the war. Tornatore and Bellucci decided that she, rather than a body double, would act that scene. \"With someone as famous as she is, I couldn't risk doing a scene like this without its being realistic,\" Tornatore says. \"If the scene is shocking, it's because it's true.\" </p> <p>Bellucci agrees. \"It was really important to me that you see it's me in the scene,\" she says, \"that you see my face and my reactions, that you see the violence.\" </p> <p>Throughout the film, Bellucci says, she tried to convey Malena's stifling lack of options. \"She makes so many mistakes because she's a slave to her situation. This character was my way to fight, to say to everybody, 'This is where we used to be.' And yet there are still so many places in the world where women are oppressed by men.\" </p> <p>She also understood Malena, she says, because of her own experience growing up in Citta di Castello, a small town in central Italy where her father has a trucking company. \"I know what it means to be in a place where everybody knows everybody, where people try to invent things about you.\" </p> <p>At the age of 18, she began studying law in the nearby city of Perugia but left her studies when she started modelling. For the next three years, she did both catwalk work and adverts for designers such as Dolce and Gabbana. Then she received two offers: an Italian television movie called Life with the Sons, and Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), in which she had a small part as one of Dracula's brides. </p> <p>Bellucci was captivated by acting, but her path was not easy. \"You need to prove that you're intelligent, so that people look at you not as an object,\" she says. She was also frustrated by the film industry in Italy. \"I love my country more than anything else, but they don't put in enough money to promote a film internationally. Only every few years do we have something that goes around the world, like Il Postino or Life is Beautiful.\" </p> <p>So in 1996 Bellucci perfected her French and started looking for work in French films as well. Her career took off after L'Appartement, a romantic thriller in which she co-starred with Vincent Cassel, whom she married last year. She won her role in Stephen Hopkins's Under Suspicion after Hopkins happened to see L'Appartement during a flight. When he met her to discuss the role of Chantal, a beauty who is consumed by jealousy of other women, Hopkins says: \"She had known people like Chantal and had some great ideas about the character, so much so that I put them in the script.\" </p> <p>Describing Bellucci's work in Under Suspicion, Morgan Freeman says: \"It's all there in her eyes. She has this quality that reminds me of Jeanne Moreau. There is a sense of having been there, that she's had a life.\" </p> <p>Bellucci now seems to manage with ease the delicate task of bridging different nations and genres. Her time is divided between her family in Italy and her husband in France. Besides her return to Italian cinema with Malena, she will soon be seen in France in the period drama Brotherhood of the Wolf, based on a historical episode involving a marauding beast in 18th-century France. She will also appear in a big French comedy, Asterix &amp; Obelix: Mission Cl\u00e9opatre, in which (no surprise) she plays what she calls an \"over the top version\" of the Egyptian queen. </p> <p>Asked whether she is interested in Hollywood, she says: \"I think of myself as a European actress. I'm ready to do another American movie if it's good for me, but not just because it's American.\" She pauses. \"I simply want to make good movies. Then, whether they're American or European doesn't matter.\" </p> <p>\u00a9 New York Times. Malena is released on March 16.</p>",

Only a month ago, you wouldn\u00cdt have suspected it: a basic \"coming soon\" site with Henry inviting you to check out \"one of the most crucial websites around\" was all that was on show. Then on February 19, a handful of journalists were invited to the launch of a \"new interactive donation experience\", a live web event featuring Lenny Henry and Joanna Lumley, \"taking you through the steps leading to the galaxy of stars\" which boasts that it features the names of every person to make an online donation.</p> <p> The idea is immediate gratification for anyone donating any amount of money (although sadly, due to a \"software error\", my name won't be joining the likes of Michael Barrymore).

Ideas like Pantasy Football (thought up by the lads at Cisco systems), an online game spoof of Fantasy Football launched on Valentine's Day with the Daily Star which allows wannabe football managers to create their dream team built from their 11 worst footballers, based on the performance of players in FA Cup, Premier League and Worthington Cup games.

Game-as-ever Robbie, the nation's favourite cheeky chappie, is giving up his kingsize bed, Technics decks and a handwritten version of his hit single Angels to go under the hammer. The actual auction will take place at Sotheby's on April 10, highlighted at <a href=\"http://www.sothebys.com/robbie\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\">sothebys.com/robbie</a>, but bidding will take place on the official site and at <a href=\"http://www.robbiewilliams.com\" target=\"_NEW\">robbiewilliams.com</a>. </p> <p> Pop stars Westlife and Craig David have also hitched their fan sites up to the mother ship and will be offering free tickets and other paraphernalia.

This time around, with a bit of luck, it could make more than all the profits of all the dotcoms in the UK in 2000 put together. Just imagine.",

Almost everyone who picks up this gun - from the man who made it many years ago to the evil men who seek it now - will come to a sticky end. </p> <p>For a movie billed as the first teaming of Pitt and Roberts, it's odd that they are rarely on screen together. Brad shambles around flyblown Mexican pueblos and cantinas in search of the gun as pastiches of Ennio Morricone fill the soundtrack.

      "body": "<p>I can remember the day I found God. I wasn't on the road to Damascus, I wasn't one of the apostles and I don't think my name ever appeared in any of the testaments. No, I was at the Dell the day I found God, and he wore a number seven shirt. </p> <p>It was a cold October night, it wasn't a particularly good game. In fact, despite Saints winning 2-1, they were often under the cosh and were in all honesty the lesser of the two teams. But in two moments of sublime, inspirational skill, the three points floated gently down the road to the FA Points Safe in the basement of the Dell. </p> <p>Point number one, a pass to Le Tissier, who nonchalantly flicked over not one, but then two defenders, before calmly placing the ball past the oncoming keeper. Pure magic. Newcastle drew level. The game could have gone either way, until a hopeful cross drifted towards the Newcastle penalty box. Le Tissier trapped the ball of his thigh, swivelled and hit the ball on the volley unleashing an unstoppable shot into the top right-hand corner of the net. Truly unbelievable. That was the day I found God. It was a time where quality and style was a lost commodity, where work-rate and long-ball were preferred to skill and the passing game. It was an age of dour, passionless, skill-less, hit-and-hope football. It was a age the history books would eventually call the Branfoot era. But there was one shining light at the end of that tunnel, it was called Matthew Le Tissier. </p> <p>At a time when Saints fans had very little to be upbeat about, Le Tissier gave the fans something they craved, style and class. In team full of what Mick Channon called \"hod carriers and donkeys\", Le Tissier stood head, shoulder, arms and elbows above the rest. Despite the fact that the football played at the Dell was so poor that if you called it abysmal, Branfoot and co would probably thank you for the compliment, you could always say that the best goals scored in the Premiership were scored there.</p> <p> When Branfoot finally got the message and left the club in early 1994, Saints fans were thrilled at the prospect of having Le Tissier linking up with probably the one manager who could get the best out of him, Alan Ball. It was the dream ticket: Alan Ball reunited with Lawrie McMenemy, with probably the most talented player in the country to be given a free reign. </p> <p>What a glorious time it was too. With Ronnie Ekelund up front with him, the following season Matt produced the best football in his illustrious career scoring thirty goals and creating just as many. To coin a phrase, that year Matt Le Tissier was truly unbelievable.</p> <p> Alan Ball was to leave the next season, whether the board did enough to keep him or he simply wanted a the next bigger, better deal, who knows. One thing was for certain, that he was the last and only manager who knew how to handle Le Tiss. Dave Merrington promised so much for the Dell faithful, but sadly lacked the know-how or the motivational skills needed to bring the best of Matt. Subsequent managers also failed to find the qualities needed to see the bloody obvious. You give him the ball and let him do his thing. Obvious really.</p> <p> One of the reasons why Matt struggles for fitness today is down to us, really. There was a time when, if Matt Le Tissier's name wasn't on the team-sheet, it was a portent of doom for all. Many's the time Matt was rushed back to the first team without really having time to get over his injuries. In effect, Matt paid a price for being too damn good.</p> <p> But we seem to be forgetting one major point in all this. After the summer of Matt, every team wanted him. Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool all wanted him. Alex Ferguson was a massive fan of the Channel Islander. After Matt's last game for England against Italy, Ferguson devoted two whole pages in the Manchester United programme singing Le Tissier's praises . Who knows what direction Matt's career might have taken if he'd have played under the Scotsman?</p> <p>It is, of course, a hypothetical argument, as Matt did what no-one thought a professional footballer would do. He turned down the big money in favour of staying where he was happy. He decided that the quality of his life here in Southampton was more important than doubling his money and moving to a more \"glamorous\" club. And we loved him for it.</p> <p>With the end of the last season at the Dell fast approaching, Saints fans are left with the unbelievable prospect of Southampton's favourite son playing football next season for a team other than Saints, and I for one am appalled at the prospect. </p> <p>But as bad as that may be, it pales into insignificance compared to the reaction of one section of the Southampton fan base, who seem not to care whether he goes or not. The phrases, \"He has to play for his money,\" and, \"He's past his prime,\" seem to come forth from certain quarters, mainly from people who should either (a) know better or (b) have a ridiculously short memory. For, if the truth be told, we owe Matthew Le Tissier far more than we could ever know.</p> <p> It's hard to be objective at a time like this. A time where Saints are doing very nicely thank you without Matt in the side, a Saints side full of promising youngsters and international squad wannabes. Saints are in a better position than they have been in years, and with that it would seem that people such as Matt and Francis Benali are now forgotten people as the next generation of Saints heroes take the field. </p> <p>It's easy to do so: Frannie hasn't played first-team football for a while, and Matt has had injury after injury impeding his bid for a first-team place. It would be so easy if they both just disappeared from sight so none of us could make a decision either way when it comes to their futures at the club.</p> <p>With that in mind, allow me to put my two-penneth worth in. For me, if Benali and Le Tissier are allowed to leave this club, then we might as well pack up our stripes and become Man Utd fans. We might as well succumb to the Man Utd bedspread-and-pencil brigade right now, as it's obvious that we don't have the bottle or the sheer common decency to support a team like Saints. </p> <p>For me, these two players represent everything good about this club, everything that I love about it. Good, decent men, who have put Southampton Football Club first and their purse strings second. You can say what you want about Matt earning good money anyway, as he could have tripled his money elsewhere. You can forget arguing about Francis Benali's ability, because when the chips were down, he never let his club down, never once flinched in putting himself in the line of fire. I've lost count of the amount of goal line clearances the man has made. </p> <p> So what is my point exactly? A simple one. These two individuals are without doubt two of the nicest professional footballers you're likely to meet. Two people who are pretty much public property in terms of autograph hunters and fans, yet not once have I seen either of them project anything other than a friendly, approachable one. Two consummate professionals who are superb ambassadors for the club. Yet apparently disposable. </p> <p>With Matt out of the team and Frannie at Forest, you have to ask yourself what you want out of this club, because make no bones about it, if it wasn't for the likes of these two there would be no Premier League Southampton. We constantly berate Man Utd fans as being soft in the head and valuing trophies more than supporting their local teams, yet once a local icon starts to hit a rough patch it's, \"Well thanks a lot Matt, here's your cheque, now piss off to Fulham.\" Disgraceful.

      "bodyText": "I can remember the day I found God. I wasn't on the road to Damascus, I wasn't one of the apostles and I don't think my name ever appeared in any of the testaments. No, I was at the Dell the day I found God, and he wore a number seven shirt. It was a cold October night, it wasn't a particularly good game. In fact, despite Saints winning 2-1, they were often under the cosh and were in all honesty the lesser of the two teams. But in two moments of sublime, inspirational skill, the three points floated gently down the road to the FA Points Safe in the basement of the Dell. Point number one, a pass to Le Tissier, who nonchalantly flicked over not one, but then two defenders, before calmly placing the ball past the oncoming keeper. Pure magic. Newcastle drew level. The game could have gone either way, until a hopeful cross drifted towards the Newcastle penalty box. Le Tissier trapped the ball of his thigh, swivelled and hit the ball on the volley unleashing an unstoppable shot into the top right-hand corner of the net. Truly unbelievable. That was the day I found God. It was a time where quality and style was a lost commodity, where work-rate and long-ball were preferred to skill and the passing game. It was an age of dour, passionless, skill-less, hit-and-hope football. It was a age the history books would eventually call the Branfoot era. But there was one shining light at the end of that tunnel, it was called Matthew Le Tissier. At a time when Saints fans had very little to be upbeat about, Le Tissier gave the fans something they craved, style and class. In team full of what Mick Channon called \"hod carriers and donkeys\", Le Tissier stood head, shoulder, arms and elbows above the rest. Despite the fact that the football played at the Dell was so poor that if you called it abysmal, Branfoot and co would probably thank you for the compliment, you could always say that the best goals scored in the Premiership were scored there. When Branfoot finally got the message and left the club in early 1994, Saints fans were thrilled at the prospect of having Le Tissier linking up with probably the one manager who could get the best out of him, Alan Ball. It was the dream ticket: Alan Ball reunited with Lawrie McMenemy, with probably the most talented player in the country to be given a free reign. What a glorious time it was too. With Ronnie Ekelund up front with him, the following season Matt produced the best football in his illustrious career scoring thirty goals and creating just as many. To coin a phrase, that year Matt Le Tissier was truly unbelievable. Alan Ball was to leave the next season, whether the board did enough to keep him or he simply wanted a the next bigger, better deal, who knows. One thing was for certain, that he was the last and only manager who knew how to handle Le Tiss. Dave Merrington promised so much for the Dell faithful, but sadly lacked the know-how or the motivational skills needed to bring the best of Matt. Subsequent managers also failed to find the qualities needed to see the bloody obvious. You give him the ball and let him do his thing. Obvious really. One of the reasons why Matt struggles for fitness today is down to us, really. There was a time when, if Matt Le Tissier's name wasn't on the team-sheet, it was a portent of doom for all. Many's the time Matt was rushed back to the first team without really having time to get over his injuries. In effect, Matt paid a price for being too damn good. But we seem to be forgetting one major point in all this. After the summer of Matt, every team wanted him. Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool all wanted him. Alex Ferguson was a massive fan of the Channel Islander. After Matt's last game for England against Italy, Ferguson devoted two whole pages in the Manchester United programme singing Le Tissier's praises . Who knows what direction Matt's career might have taken if he'd have played under the Scotsman? It is, of course, a hypothetical argument, as Matt did what no-one thought a professional footballer would do. He turned down the big money in favour of staying where he was happy. He decided that the quality of his life here in Southampton was more important than doubling his money and moving to a more \"glamorous\" club. And we loved him for it. With the end of the last season at the Dell fast approaching, Saints fans are left with the unbelievable prospect of Southampton's favourite son playing football next season for a team other than Saints, and I for one am appalled at the prospect. But as bad as that may be, it pales into insignificance compared to the reaction of one section of the Southampton fan base, who seem not to care whether he goes or not. The phrases, \"He has to play for his money,\" and, \"He's past his prime,\" seem to come forth from certain quarters, mainly from people who should either (a) know better or (b) have a ridiculously short memory. For, if the truth be told, we owe Matthew Le Tissier far more than we could ever know. It's hard to be objective at a time like this. A time where Saints are doing very nicely thank you without Matt in the side, a Saints side full of promising youngsters and international squad wannabes. Saints are in a better position than they have been in years, and with that it would seem that people such as Matt and Francis Benali are now forgotten people as the next generation of Saints heroes take the field. It's easy to do so: Frannie hasn't played first-team football for a while, and Matt has had injury after injury impeding his bid for a first-team place. It would be so easy if they both just disappeared from sight so none of us could make a decision either way when it comes to their futures at the club. With that in mind, allow me to put my two-penneth worth in. For me, if Benali and Le Tissier are allowed to leave this club, then we might as well pack up our stripes and become Man Utd fans. We might as well succumb to the Man Utd bedspread-and-pencil brigade right now, as it's obvious that we don't have the bottle or the sheer common decency to support a team like Saints. For me, these two players represent everything good about this club, everything that I love about it. Good, decent men, who have put Southampton Football Club first and their purse strings second. You can say what you want about Matt earning good money anyway, as he could have tripled his money elsewhere. You can forget arguing about Francis Benali's ability, because when the chips were down, he never let his club down, never once flinched in putting himself in the line of fire. I've lost count of the amount of goal line clearances the man has made. So what is my point exactly? A simple one. These two individuals are without doubt two of the nicest professional footballers you're likely to meet. Two people who are pretty much public property in terms of autograph hunters and fans, yet not once have I seen either of them project anything other than a friendly, approachable one. Two consummate professionals who are superb ambassadors for the club. Yet apparently disposable. With Matt out of the team and Frannie at Forest, you have to ask yourself what you want out of this club, because make no bones about it, if it wasn't for the likes of these two there would be no Premier League Southampton. We constantly berate Man Utd fans as being soft in the head and valuing trophies more than supporting their local teams, yet once a local icon starts to hit a rough patch it's, \"Well thanks a lot Matt, here's your cheque, now piss off to Fulham.\" Disgraceful. Up there with the Terry Paines, Mick Channons and Ron Davieses, this man is a Southampton legend and we're prepared to shove him in favour of our next Latvian/Moroccan/Norwegian idol. This club owes both of these two players a huge amount and it's up to the club to get these contracts sorted out. The prospect of casting these two players out like used clothes for the Sally Army is appalling. With the clamour regarding Hassan Kachoul's wage demands, can we please remember one man who asked for little and gave so much. Time is running out. A big testimonial, a new contract and no more division amongst fans in regards to the man. Call me sentimental, but the sun does indeed shine out of his behind Agree? Disagree?

      "bodyText": "Pictures of cancer-ridden lungs on cigarette packets - to be allowed under new EU legislation - are set to spawn a new product category: cigarette packet covers. A Canadian company is planning to bring its cardboard covers, which can be slipped over a packet of cigarettes, to Europe in the light of the new rules on marketing tobacco. The manufacturers hope to cash in on smokers' embarrassment at being faced with horrifying images every time they light up. The covers, which cost about 40p, carry pictures such as a skull and crossbones, sunflowers, tattoos or cannabis leaves. One has a smiley face and the caption, \"It's cool\". Quebec-based company Cigarette Cover launched the disposable covers in response to Canadian laws to boost the size of the health warnings - including images - that appear on cigarette packets. In the EU, from 2003, health warnings must cover 30% of a packet and individual countries can decide whether to introduce pictorial warnings. Cigarette Cover spokesman Luc Renaud said the company had plans to introduce the covers in Europe and elsewhere. \"We are planning to launch our covers internationally,\" he said. \"We are just starting to manufacture a new size of cover for packs of 20 cigarettes because in Canada we have packs of 25. \"The new size could be used in Europe,\" he explained. The covers are distributed by Quebec magazine distributor Benjamin News, which delivers to 10,000 stores. In the past month, it has distributed 900 racks containing 144 covers per rack. Benjamin News distribution manager Marie Labrecques said: \"Sales are amazing - a lot better than we expected - and there is demand from all over Canada. This is a new product category.\" Three or four other companies are manufacturing similar covers. UK anti-smoking group Action on Smoking and Health spokeswoman Amanda Sandford said: \"These covers show that the health warnings are effective. \"As the smokers themselves have reported, they are put off by grisly images. \"I don't think it will negate the graphic warnings - on the contrary, the publicity around it will raise awareness even more,\" she said.

Those are just two words that Nicholas Coleridge will not want to hear this week, for they were two women's magazines which, although laudable in many ways, failed to survive today's almost impossibly cutthroat publishing market. A few other dreaded words are: \"What, another women's magazine?\", a question he and the rest of Cond\u00e9 Nast have heard several times in the past few months, and one they have probably asked themselves a couple of times as well. Adding to the gloom caused by the deaths of Frank and Minx, the latest six-monthly average sales figures show declines for almost every women's magazine. </p> <p>Yet just two weeks after the launch of InStyle UK, here comes Glamour. There is undoubtedly a kind of competition going on here between publishing houses, Time-Life and Cond\u00e9 Nast, but, looking at the women's magazine market today, are they running a futile lose-lose race? </p> <p>Coleridge is quite right when he describes Glamour as one of the most successful women's magazines in the United States. But it has always been more like the wallpaper in the US magazine world than an essential piece of furniture: it's there, it's nice, readers appreciate it as a piece of decor, but it has never felt essential. It has not achieved central cult status in the way that magazines such as Cosmopolitan or Vogue have, which probably explains why few British readers have heard of it before. Yet its impressive circulation figures are a testament to Glamour's very simple formula: it wants to make its readers feel good. Whereas the far more elitist Vogue is about people who are more in vogue than you are, Glamour's potentially equally elitist title is simply about making its readers feel glamorous. </p> <p>Preppy, sunny, girlish smiles radiate from every one of its pages. In this month's issue there are features on what your man loves about your body, how to have more confidence in bed, stilettos that won't hurt your feet and \"I Nailed My Rapist\". So far, so happy. There is none of that body fascism or other similar feel-bad features (\"Lose five inches off your thighs - IN TEN MINUTES!!!\") so beloved of other women's magazines, particularly American ones. The usual effortlessly readable quizzes and surveys abound, as do their fashion equivalents, photo-spreads of this month's accessories and make-up. </p> <p>There is a relaxed mix of the silly and the serious (on one page, a feature on how to dye your pubic hair rests unapologetically above a piece on fertility myths), so unlike Marie Claire, for example, which cordons off its \"healthy\" features (death in Rwanda, biographies of forgotten artists, etc) from its more indulgent spreads, like a clucking mother making you eat your broccoli before you can start on dessert. </p> <p>Cond\u00e9 Nast is clearly, and understandably, a little nervous about launching its baby into such an unstable market, as is apparent in this gimmick of making the magazine pocketbook size. It is unlikely that this will be a big plus to potential readers, and I'd be surprised if it stays that size for more than six months. However, it will give Glamour a stand-out identity amid the sea of other competing women's titles. The real test, as ever, will lie in the way the magazine targets its readers. </p> <p>The reason so many British women's glossy magazines fail is because they try to appeal to as many as women as possible, across the age and social brackets. The result is a magazine that does not seem to be aimed at any one person in particular, one that falls back on Ally McBeal (the so-called Everywoman of television, although many would beg to differ) cliches and fashion shoots that appeal to no one - too dowdy for the under 35s, too bright for the older age brackets. </p> <p>American women's magazines are able to avoid this, partly because they have a larger market and thus have the confidence to target certain pockets, rather than trying to cast too wide a net, and therefore garner more readers in specific age brackets than less-focused magazines do from across the spectra. </p> <p>Cliched, All-Bar-One images of young women abound in British Glamour's press release (\"Flat- sharing urbanites who work to live and love fashion, friends and the famous\"), but generalisations are the grist of such publicity announcements; let's just hope they are not translated into editorial content. </p> <p>American Glamour is unashamedly fun, without resorting to too much fluffy ditziness, or ever feeling the need to justify itself, or trying to be too inclusive to too many readers. British Glamour will need to have similar confidence if it still wants to be on UK newsagents' shelves in 12 months' time.</p>",

She won't talk about closures - she points out that any bad news would affect her residents - but she does talk obliquely about \"diversifying\".</p> <p>\"I need to look at diversifying, which is heartbreaking, as I've worked for 20 years with the elderly,\" she said.</p> <p>She is joining up to 1,000 other residential and nursing care home owners, members of the National Care Home Association (NCHA), on a parliamentary lobby. The association says its members' businesses are going to the wall.</p> <p>Currently, Ms Ahmed's business offers a home to 19 elderly residents, all over 65. And she claims it's a good example of the high-quality end of the residential care market. \"We have Investors in People, which is a nationally accredited system of acknowledging training and staffing needs, and we meet all the contract compliance requirements of council.\"</p> <p>For Ms Ahmed, there is big pressure looming in the form of new government standards covering matters such as the amount of space each resident must have and staff training. \"I have to look very carefully at where I can make more beds to make it viable. We will lose two beds under the new standards, so, unless we have the money to invest, that's an issue.\"</p> <p>There are other problems, too - nowadays, residents are older and more frail than a decade or two ago, thanks in part to people living longer and the trend towards supporting people in their own homes. Good care for the frail elderly doesn't come cheap, says Ms Ahmed.</p> <p>Her worry is that \"big conglomerates\" will be able to make economies of scale and \"sweep up the market\". Meanwhile, small, local homes will go bust. \"The funding of the beds in the smaller units is becoming acute,\" she said. The result, she believes, will be large, 60-bed homes, akin to the old long-stay geriatric wards that were shut under community care policies. \"The small units are the ones that will be destabilised, and residents will suffer as they're moved around and homes close.\"</p> <p>But the issue that has been making care home owners angry for some time is the fees they receive from local authorities. The state - local and central - funds something like seven in 10 of residential and nursing care home places. That, argue the owners, puts councils in an enviable position when it comes to determining the amount they will pay for places.</p> <p>\"Local authorities, as a 70% purchaser don't really enter into negotiations, so home owners have to take it or leave it,\" said Sheila Scott, chief executive of the National Care Homes Association. </p> <p>Ms Ahmed said: \"At my home, we get approximately \u00a3240 per person per week. When you look at the impact of the minimum wage and working time regulations, that's put around \u00a36,000 on my wages' bill in a year. But the income has not gone up. Local authority funding is going up by around 2%.\" </p> <p>Because care homes are short of money, it's hard for them to recruit nurses and other care staff, they argue.</p> <p>And they are in a competitive market. Ms Ahmed has higher paying shopping malls and supermarkets on her doorstep. \"A new Sainsbury's opened up paying \u00a35.50 an hour and we struggle at \u00a34.60 an hour. It doesn't take a mathematician to work out the figures don't add up.\"</p> <p>Unison national social services officer Owen Davies agreed: \"If we are really going to raise standards, then the people who work in homes are going to have to be paid greatly improved wage levels.\"</p> <p>However, there's a sense that care home owners have only themselves to blame. \"Unison's experience was that, when old people's homes were privatised, the people who ran them put in very low bids in order to win business away from local government and were forced, as a result, to pay very low wages to their employees.\"</p> <p>Unison doesn't dispute there's a crisis, however. \"There's no doubt that the result of the privatisation of the care of old people has now led to a crisis and it's also obviously the case that more public money needs to be invested in the care of our old people,\" said Mr Davies.</p> <p>But the union's solution is a different one from Ms Ahmed's. Mr Owen said: \"There are a lot of elderly people who cannot pay for their care and we, as a society, have to pay that. But the best way is through council-run homes or support in their own homes.\"</p>",

Local authority funding is going up by around 2%.\" Because care homes are short of money, it's hard for them to recruit nurses and other care staff, they argue. And they are in a competitive market. Ms Ahmed has higher paying shopping malls and supermarkets on her doorstep. \"A new Sainsbury's opened up paying \u00a35.50 an hour and we struggle at \u00a34.60 an hour. It doesn't take a mathematician to work out the figures don't add up.\" Unison national social services officer Owen Davies agreed: \"If we are really going to raise standards, then the people who work in homes are going to have to be paid greatly improved wage levels.\" However, there's a sense that care home owners have only themselves to blame. \"Unison's experience was that, when old people's homes were privatised, the people who ran them put in very low bids in order to win business away from local government and were forced, as a result, to pay very low wages to their employees.\" Unison doesn't dispute there's a crisis, however. \"There's no doubt that the result of the privatisation of the care of old people has now led to a crisis and it's also obviously the case that more public money needs to be invested in the care of our old people,\" said Mr Davies. But the union's solution is a different one from Ms Ahmed's. Mr Owen said: \"There are a lot of elderly people who cannot pay for their care and we, as a society, have to pay that. But the best way is through council-run homes or support in their own homes.\"",

      "body": "<p>Der Mensch, die <strong>Krone</strong> der <strong>Sch\u00f6pfung</strong>. Was haben <strong>wir uns </strong>immer darauf <strong>eingebildet</strong>, die am weitesten entwickelte Spezies zu sein. Und jetzt das: Nur 30.000 Gene bestimmen \u00fcber unser Aussehen, \u00fcber unseren K\u00f6rper, seine Krankheiten, seine Eigenheiten. 30.000 Gene. Das sind gerade mal doppelt so viele wie die einer <strong>Fruchtfliege</strong>. Und wenn man uns - genetisch gesehen - auf eine Ebene mit Gem\u00fcse stellen will, dann ist der Vergleich mit Mais <strong>angebracht</strong>. Der hat n\u00e4mlich genau so viele Gene wie der Mensch. </p> <p>Zwei unabh\u00e4ngige wissenschaftliche Teams haben in den vergangenen Wochen die Ergebnisse ihrer Forschungen ver\u00f6ffentlicht. Und wer bisher dachte, der Mensch sei allen anderen Lebewesen nur deshalb \u00fcberlegen, weil er viel mehr Gene hat als sie, der wird <strong>bitter entt\u00e4uscht</strong> sein.</p> <p>Und dennoch: Die Forschungsergebnisse haben die Wissenschaft vorangebracht. Ist der genetische Code erst <strong>entschl\u00fcsselt</strong>, k\u00f6nnten Krankheiten geheilt oder sogar vermieden werden. Doch f\u00fcr euphorische Zukunftsplanungen ist es, warnen Wissenschaftler, bei weitem zu fr\u00fch. Es k\u00f6nnte Jahrzehnte dauern, bis das <strong>R\u00e4tsel</strong> um das <strong>Zusammenspiel</strong> der genetischen Bausteine <strong>gel\u00fcftet </strong>ist. Besteht dennoch Hoffnung auf ein Leben ohne Krankheiten? Und wenn ja: Wie weit d\u00fcrfen Wissenschaftler gehen, um einen f\u00fcr immer gesunden Menschen zu \"schaffen\"?</p> <p><strong>30.000 Gene machen einen Menschen aus. Rund 70.000 weniger, als man bisher angenommen hatte. Hat euch dieses Forschungsergebnis \u00fcberrascht? </strong></p> <p><strong>Michael (19) </strong>: Bis ich von dem Ergebnis geh\u00f6rt habe, hatte ich mir eigentlich nie Gedanken gemacht, wie viele Gene ein Mensch haben k\u00f6nnte. Ist ja eigentlich auch egal, wenn alles funktioniert, oder?</p> <p><strong>Martina (17) </strong>: Wir haben uns in Biologie dar\u00fcber unterhalten. Eigentlich war aber niemand geschockt, dass der Mensch \"nur\" aus 30.000 Genen besteht. Was soll auch diese Rechnerei. Wir wissen ja, was Menschen k\u00f6nnen und wie sie aussehen. </p> <p><strong>Mirjam (15) </strong>: Geschockt nicht. Ich fand es eher witzig. Da bildet man sich immer ein, so etwas besonderes zu sein. Und dann erf\u00e4hrt man auf einmal, dass Mais uns rein von der Anzahl der Gene her in nichts <strong>nachsteht. </strong></p> <p><strong>Ist das menschliche Erbgut erst entschl\u00fcsselt, k\u00f6nnten Krankheiten geheilt, besser erkannt oder sogar vermieden werden... </strong></p> <p><strong>Anton (16) </strong>: Das mag schon sein. Ich glaube aber, dass es noch lange dauern wird, bis man tats\u00e4chlich alle Kr\u00e4fte, die im K\u00f6rper zusammenspielen, richtig einordnen kann. Wahrscheinlich wird nicht einmal mehr meine Generation davon <strong>profitieren</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Mirjam</strong>: Ich stelle mir das gigantisch vor, ein Leben ohne Krankheiten... Man muss aber auch daran denken, dass es immer noch Krankheiten gibt, die nicht vom Erbmaterial abh\u00e4ngen. Ganz ohne gesundheitliche Probleme wird der Mensch also wohl nie leben k\u00f6nnen.</p> <p><strong>Seht ihr Gefahren auf die Menschheit zukommen, wenn erst alle Geheimnisse des Erbmaterials erforscht sind? </strong></p> <p><strong>Martina</strong>: Ehrlich gesagt: Ja. Ich habe ein bisschen Angst davor, dass man sich den perfekten Menschen <strong>z\u00fcchten</strong> will, dass M\u00fctter Kinder <strong>abtreiben</strong>, nur weil sie vorher wissen, dass sie krank sein werden. Ich denke, man sollte der Natur in gewissen Dingen <strong>ihren Lauf lassen</strong>, sich nicht \u00fcberall einmischen. </p> <p><strong>Anton</strong>: Der Mensch ist doch gebildet genug, um mit diesem Wissen umzugehen. Es wird mit Sicherheit keine Auswahl der <strong>St\u00e4rksten, Ges\u00fcndesten</strong> und <strong>Sch\u00f6nsten</strong> geben. Diese <strong>Wahnvorstellungen</strong> hatten wir schon einmal in Deutschland und wir haben gesehen, wo sie hinf\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen. Ich bin mir sicher, dass wir daraus gelernt haben. </p> <p><strong>Michael</strong>: Vielleicht wird das Gesetz Vorschriften machen m\u00fcssen, wann und wie wir unser Wissen <strong>einsetzen</strong> d\u00fcrfen. Wenn einem Menschen geholfen werden k\u00f6nnte, weil man Gene sozusagen \"reparieren\" kann, f\u00e4nde ich das in Ordnung. Wenn man aber Lebewesen <strong>klont</strong>, sie also als <strong>Ersatzteillager</strong> z\u00fcchtet, um anderen zu helfen, widerspricht das meinen moralischen Vorstellungen. <br> <strong>Mirjam</strong>: Diese Gefahr sehe ich bereits viel fr\u00fcher und in einem anderen Punkt: Das \"<strong>Wettr\u00fcsten</strong>\" zwischen den einzelnen Forschungsteams hat doch bereits begonnen. Wer hat die besseren Ergebnisse, wer kann das Erbmaterial schneller entschl\u00fcsseln. Ich finde, in solch wichtigen Dingen sollten alle zusammenarbeiten und <strong>sich</strong> nicht <strong>gegenseitig ausboten</strong>. <br> </p> <p><strong>Glossar/Glossary </strong></p> <p> <strong>abtreiben</strong> to have an abortion<br> <strong>angebracht sein</strong> reasonable, advisable</p> <p><strong>sich gegenseitig ausboten</strong> to play one (person, team) off against another</p> <p><strong>sich etw. einbilden</strong> to be conceited</p> <p><strong>einsetzen</strong> to use sth.

      "bodyText": "Der Mensch, die Krone der Sch\u00f6pfung. Was haben wir uns immer darauf eingebildet, die am weitesten entwickelte Spezies zu sein. Und jetzt das: Nur 30.000 Gene bestimmen \u00fcber unser Aussehen, \u00fcber unseren K\u00f6rper, seine Krankheiten, seine Eigenheiten. 30.000 Gene. Das sind gerade mal doppelt so viele wie die einer Fruchtfliege. Und wenn man uns - genetisch gesehen - auf eine Ebene mit Gem\u00fcse stellen will, dann ist der Vergleich mit Mais angebracht. Der hat n\u00e4mlich genau so viele Gene wie der Mensch. Zwei unabh\u00e4ngige wissenschaftliche Teams haben in den vergangenen Wochen die Ergebnisse ihrer Forschungen ver\u00f6ffentlicht. Und wer bisher dachte, der Mensch sei allen anderen Lebewesen nur deshalb \u00fcberlegen, weil er viel mehr Gene hat als sie, der wird bitter entt\u00e4uscht sein. Und dennoch: Die Forschungsergebnisse haben die Wissenschaft vorangebracht. Ist der genetische Code erst entschl\u00fcsselt, k\u00f6nnten Krankheiten geheilt oder sogar vermieden werden. Doch f\u00fcr euphorische Zukunftsplanungen ist es, warnen Wissenschaftler, bei weitem zu fr\u00fch. Es k\u00f6nnte Jahrzehnte dauern, bis das R\u00e4tsel um das Zusammenspiel der genetischen Bausteine gel\u00fcftet ist. Besteht dennoch Hoffnung auf ein Leben ohne Krankheiten? Und wenn ja: Wie weit d\u00fcrfen Wissenschaftler gehen, um einen f\u00fcr immer gesunden Menschen zu \"schaffen\"? 30.000 Gene machen einen Menschen aus. Rund 70.000 weniger, als man bisher angenommen hatte. Hat euch dieses Forschungsergebnis \u00fcberrascht? Michael (19) : Bis ich von dem Ergebnis geh\u00f6rt habe, hatte ich mir eigentlich nie Gedanken gemacht, wie viele Gene ein Mensch haben k\u00f6nnte. Ist ja eigentlich auch egal, wenn alles funktioniert, oder? Martina (17) : Wir haben uns in Biologie dar\u00fcber unterhalten. Eigentlich war aber niemand geschockt, dass der Mensch \"nur\" aus 30.000 Genen besteht. Was soll auch diese Rechnerei. Wir wissen ja, was Menschen k\u00f6nnen und wie sie aussehen. Mirjam (15) : Geschockt nicht. Ich fand es eher witzig. Da bildet man sich immer ein, so etwas besonderes zu sein. Und dann erf\u00e4hrt man auf einmal, dass Mais uns rein von der Anzahl der Gene her in nichts nachsteht. Ist das menschliche Erbgut erst entschl\u00fcsselt, k\u00f6nnten Krankheiten geheilt, besser erkannt oder sogar vermieden werden... Anton (16) : Das mag schon sein. Ich glaube aber, dass es noch lange dauern wird, bis man tats\u00e4chlich alle Kr\u00e4fte, die im K\u00f6rper zusammenspielen, richtig einordnen kann. Wahrscheinlich wird nicht einmal mehr meine Generation davon profitieren. Mirjam: Ich stelle mir das gigantisch vor, ein Leben ohne Krankheiten... Man muss aber auch daran denken, dass es immer noch Krankheiten gibt, die nicht vom Erbmaterial abh\u00e4ngen. Ganz ohne gesundheitliche Probleme wird der Mensch also wohl nie leben k\u00f6nnen. Seht ihr Gefahren auf die Menschheit zukommen, wenn erst alle Geheimnisse des Erbmaterials erforscht sind? Martina: Ehrlich gesagt: Ja. Ich habe ein bisschen Angst davor, dass man sich den perfekten Menschen z\u00fcchten will, dass M\u00fctter Kinder abtreiben, nur weil sie vorher wissen, dass sie krank sein werden. Ich denke, man sollte der Natur in gewissen Dingen ihren Lauf lassen, sich nicht \u00fcberall einmischen. Anton: Der Mensch ist doch gebildet genug, um mit diesem Wissen umzugehen. Es wird mit Sicherheit keine Auswahl der St\u00e4rksten, Ges\u00fcndesten und Sch\u00f6nsten geben. Diese Wahnvorstellungen hatten wir schon einmal in Deutschland und wir haben gesehen, wo sie hinf\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen. Ich bin mir sicher, dass wir daraus gelernt haben. Michael: Vielleicht wird das Gesetz Vorschriften machen m\u00fcssen, wann und wie wir unser Wissen einsetzen d\u00fcrfen. Wenn einem Menschen geholfen werden k\u00f6nnte, weil man Gene sozusagen \"reparieren\" kann, f\u00e4nde ich das in Ordnung. Wenn man aber Lebewesen klont, sie also als Ersatzteillager z\u00fcchtet, um anderen zu helfen, widerspricht das meinen moralischen Vorstellungen. Mirjam: Diese Gefahr sehe ich bereits viel fr\u00fcher und in einem anderen Punkt: Das \"Wettr\u00fcsten\" zwischen den einzelnen Forschungsteams hat doch bereits begonnen. Wer hat die besseren Ergebnisse, wer kann das Erbmaterial schneller entschl\u00fcsseln. Ich finde, in solch wichtigen Dingen sollten alle zusammenarbeiten und sich nicht gegenseitig ausboten.

They want to move it from the killing fields to somewhere safer. </p> <p>Abbott said he and the producer, Nicola Shindler, discussed the BBC's plans, but had reservations. \"We felt the audience would stick with it on a Sunday. But they still might move it.\" </p> <p>The Sunday night ratings slaughter has shaken BBC drama. Since the autumn, BBC1's average audience share has fallen to 26.1% from 28.3%. Its prize post-9pm Sunday night dramas have been mown down, one after another, by a lethal mix of long-running stock ITV series, such as Heartbeat and London's Burning, and two-part specials, such as The Innocent. Ambitious, expensive pieces such as Take a Girl Like You, Rebel Heart, Love in a Cold Climate and now, most recently and shockingly, Best of Both Worlds, the contemporary drama about an air hostess's bigamy, have all fared badly. </p> <p>The BBC1 tradition of classic drama on Sunday nights is going up in smoke. Abbott, who wrote Best of Both Worlds, is used to success - his previous work includes Cracker, Reckless and Touching Evil - so he found the 21% share gained by the second episode sobering. \"Yeah, we didn't pull the audience in. And it wasn't for lack of press coverage, we got loads.\" He suggests that Alice Evans, who played the lead, was not a familiar face, and that too much comedy was edited out. </p> <p>Perhaps audiences are getting lazier, refusing to commit time to unknown properties. \"I don't know what the answer is,\" Abbott says. \"The BBC may have lost its way over the years, so they've got to do a very strong climb back. But it hard to see, when you're not bringing the audience to you, how you're going to effect that. To reclaim Sunday nights they'll have to throw bigger and bigger stuff at it. Over the years, the BBC must have let that go. I'm sure the new team will pull that audience back. But they've got to hit higher: Take a Girl Like You - my dad wouldn't watch it. It appeals to a very specialised audience.\" </p> <p>But ITV has been \"very consistent in plying its two-part trade,\" says Abbott, in a reference to the special dramas that break up the standard fare of Heartbeat and Peak Practice and, crucially, attract upmarket viewers. \"Fragile Heart - superb; The Innocent - fantastic. They've upped the stakes. ITV audiences know what to expect.\" </p> <p>BBC1's Sunday night dilemma is just part of the ongoing problems facing the channel's new-ish controller, Lorraine Heggessey. Heavily promoted comedies such as Office Gossip and Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years have flopped in her new Friday night comedy zone. </p> <p>The issue, say her supporters, is how to identify programmes and ideas which retain BBC1's diverse mix, have an inclusive, collective spirit, but also respond to a big cultural shift among audiences, who seem to prefer the predictable. </p> <p>A BBC insider blames the current poor showing on decisions taken before Heggessey took up her post. \"It stems back to two years ago, when, in a state of angst the BBC said, 'Let's take a risk, go with the creative people and give them leeway.' But they are coming back with programmes that are not ideal, there's been no reality check. Lorraine has inherited a lot of wrong programmes, nor are they the right length now that the news has moved. It will be autumn before the new stuff starts feeding through.\" </p> <p>The BBC's preoccupations may explain its failure to rebut last week's reports that ITV is usurping Auntie's natural heartland and gaining more upmarket and younger viewers. </p> <p>ITV's figures were questionable, because they excluded the GMTV effect - the breakfast broadcaster attracts a more downmarket audience profile. A cynic might also suggest that, with Carlton last week confirming TV advertising revenue is down by about 5%, talking up the value of your audiences makes perfect business sense. </p> <p>The truth is that the BBC is more in sync with the nation's white-collar, middle-class social make up. But the trend is interesting: ITV is closing the gap by selectively targeting ABC1s, while benefiting from what researchers identify as a general easing of middle-class snobbery towards entertainment TV. </p> <p>The research consultant Colin Macleod says, \"ITV is probably better at promotion of its programmes, and at cross marketing. But that apart, tastes are dumbing down, upmarket people want to be entertained with stuff that's not too demanding or too provocative, that is simple to absorb, and which they don't have to work too hard to take in. That is different from 10 years ago.\" </p> <p>The main channels agree that viewers are increasingly unwilling to try out unfamiliar programmes with unfamiliar faces - the BBC's Sunday night problem affects them all to a greater or lesser extent. </p> <p>ITV, in any case, must move with the times to keep the advertisers happy. The population, as defined by the audience researchers Barb, is now composed of 45% ABC1s, compared with 32% in 1980. This is a massive shift for a medium which has always appealed to most of the poorer, older, less mobile groups. BBC1 remains most upmarket, with 45.8% of its audience classified as ABC1, with Channel 4 next at 44.6% then BBC2 at 44%. ITV, at 38%, still trails. But it is moving up, albeit slowly, by one percentage point a year. </p> <p>It is a BBC1 programme, EastEnders, which perfectly encapsulates a mass market channel's aims: 45% of its audience is ABC1, exactly matching the social map of Britain, which makes the decision to show a fourth episode entirely understandable. </p> <p>BBC1's disappointment over the flop of so many expensive, hand crafted dramas is shared by Channel 4's disppointment over the poor showing last year for its lengthy legal drama series, North Square: only three dramas, Queer as Folk, Kid in the Corner and Never Never really gained impact and attention in the past year. </p> <p>But ITV is proving, through a clearly devised strategy, that it can supplement a strong basic raft of mass-market programmes with premium plums. Channel 4 snorts with derision, however, at ITV's claim to be plundering its hold on prized younger adults: ITV's share of under 34s is reported by Channel 4 to be down 5% year on year. </p> <p>ITV demonstrates that it pays to target certain groups with programmes which gain a more upmarket profile: A Touch of Frost gained a 48% share of ABC1s, The Innocent 41%. Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? gained 42% share of 16 to 34 year olds; Popstars got 50%, Tarrant on TV 46%, Blind Date 45%, SMtv/CDUK 48%, An Audience with Ricky Martin 48%. Yet the evidence that differences are eroding, that \"upmarket\" and \"downmarket\" people watch the same programmes as everyone else, is not conclusive. </p> <p>True, last Friday a group of media companies unveiled research into the media habits of \"VIP-ers\" - members of the elite AB social groups - to see what motivates them to switch on. Watching TV is their favourite way to de-stress: 22% turn on the TV every day with this in mind, compared with 13% who read and 8% who listen to music. It bears out the view that television is there principally to entertain and keep them up to date. </p> <p>Yet at the same time Channel 4 has found that top social groups specifically seek out its programmes: Channel 4 News attracts a 55% ABC1 audience, up from 52% last year. The Kama Sutra got 54% of ABC1s, The 1940s House got 53%, and The Real Stephen Hawking scored 56%. A consumer study by Carat Insight does not overturn the view that we are all Millionaire watchers now, but it does suggest that differences persist some of the time and that news and information do matter. </p> <p>For ABC1s, 14 of their favourite programmes are on BBC1, three on ITV, three on Channel 4 and none on Channel 5 - the performer with the most upmarket appeal would seem to be Rory Bremner. For the bottom social groups, D and E, only two programmes are on BBC1, nine are on ITV, four on Channel 4 and five Channel 5. Their heroes are Jim Davidson and Michael Barrymore. </p> <p>Trends in television, as in life, are never as simple as we're led to believe. </p> <p><strong> How ITV is targeting specific audiences in 2001 </strong><br> <strong> Mass-market programmes:</strong> </p> <p> Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? <br> Tonight with Trevor McDonald <br> Pride of Britain <br> Frank Skinner Show <br> Survivor <br> The Vice <br> Don't Try This at Home <br> The Human Zoo </p> <p><strong> Upmarket:</strong> </p> <p>Uncle Silas <br> Nicholas Nickleby <br> The Mayor of Casterbridge <br> The Innocent <br> Micawber <br> Thursday the 12th (Paula Milne drama special) </p> <p><strong> 16-34s:</strong> </p> <p>Cold Feet <br> Bad Girls <br> Bob Martin <br> Baddiel &amp; Skinner Unplanned <br> Bob &amp; Rose (new drama by Russell T Davies) <br> Bean <br> Austin Powers </p> <p> <strong> Men:</strong> </p> <p>Champions League, Premier League and Formula One <br></p> <p><strong> VIPers - what very important people watch to relax </strong><br> </p> <p> Have I Got News for You <br> Ten O'Clock News <br> Inspector Morse <br> Frost <br> EastEnders <br> Friends <br> Frasier <br> Match of the Day <br> Ally McBeal <br> ER <br> Anything with John Thaw </p> <p>(From VIPer, UK's Elite, second annual lifestyle study,published March 2, 2001) </p> <p><strong> Draws for top social group AB </strong><br> </p> <p> Rory Bremner <br> Horizon <br> Newsnight <br> Right to Reply <br> Food &amp; Drink <br> Equinox <br> BBC Late Evening News <br> Question Time <br> Channel 4 News <br> Have I Got News for You </p> <p><strong> Social group DE </strong><br> </p> <p> Play Your Cards Right <br> Family Affairs <br> Wheel of Fortune <br> Family Fortunes <br> Michael Barrymore's My Kind of Music <br> Diggit <br> Sunset Beach <br> National Lottery Live <br> Ricki Lake</p>",

It is a BBC1 programme, EastEnders, which perfectly encapsulates a mass market channel's aims: 45% of its audience is ABC1, exactly matching the social map of Britain, which makes the decision to show a fourth episode entirely understandable. BBC1's disappointment over the flop of so many expensive, hand crafted dramas is shared by Channel 4's disppointment over the poor showing last year for its lengthy legal drama series, North Square: only three dramas, Queer as Folk, Kid in the Corner and Never Never really gained impact and attention in the past year. But ITV is proving, through a clearly devised strategy, that it can supplement a strong basic raft of mass-market programmes with premium plums. Channel 4 snorts with derision, however, at ITV's claim to be plundering its hold on prized younger adults: ITV's share of under 34s is reported by Channel 4 to be down 5% year on year. ITV demonstrates that it pays to target certain groups with programmes which gain a more upmarket profile: A Touch of Frost gained a 48% share of ABC1s, The Innocent 41%. Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? gained 42% share of 16 to 34 year olds; Popstars got 50%, Tarrant on TV 46%, Blind Date 45%, SMtv/CDUK 48%, An Audience with Ricky Martin 48%. Yet the evidence that differences are eroding, that \"upmarket\" and \"downmarket\" people watch the same programmes as everyone else, is not conclusive. True, last Friday a group of media companies unveiled research into the media habits of \"VIP-ers\" - members of the elite AB social groups - to see what motivates them to switch on. Watching TV is their favourite way to de-stress: 22% turn on the TV every day with this in mind, compared with 13% who read and 8% who listen to music. It bears out the view that television is there principally to entertain and keep them up to date. Yet at the same time Channel 4 has found that top social groups specifically seek out its programmes: Channel 4 News attracts a 55% ABC1 audience, up from 52% last year. The Kama Sutra got 54% of ABC1s, The 1940s House got 53%, and The Real Stephen Hawking scored 56%. A consumer study by Carat Insight does not overturn the view that we are all Millionaire watchers now, but it does suggest that differences persist some of the time and that news and information do matter. For ABC1s, 14 of their favourite programmes are on BBC1, three on ITV, three on Channel 4 and none on Channel 5 - the performer with the most upmarket appeal would seem to be Rory Bremner. For the bottom social groups, D and E, only two programmes are on BBC1, nine are on ITV, four on Channel 4 and five Channel 5. Their heroes are Jim Davidson and Michael Barrymore. Trends in television, as in life, are never as simple as we're led to believe. How ITV is targeting specific audiences in 2001 Mass-market programmes: Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?

But while the general picture across the sector is one of gloom and financial failure, at London-based internet and TV convergence outfit <a href=\"http://www.now.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Network of the World</a> (NOW), one of the most ambitious dot.com enterprises, the emphasis is very much on business as usual. </p> <p>NOW launched last June, offering five themed web portals alongside a TV channel, based around the same five content genres, which is beamed to 130m homes in Asia via satellite and is available as a streamed video service to internet users elsewhere. </p> <p>The operation is a joint venture between Trans World International (TWI) and Pacific Century Cyber Works (PCCW). TWI, the TV rights management and production arm of sports marketing giant IMG, provides the content; and PCCW, founded by Hong Kong new media mogul Richard Li, brings the cash. </p> <p>When NOW launched, there was a considerable fanfare about the project's ambition to become a global interactive TV and web entertainment player once broadband arrived, and about the $1.5bn Li planned to invest in the service over five years. </p> <p>Then, towards the end of last year, PCCW ran into financial difficulties. The global sell-off of technology stocks, along with concerns about the level of debt Li took on to buy Hong Kong Telecom, began to bite. PCCW's Hong Kong-listed share price collapsed. </p> <p>In October PCCW announced a $200m annual cap on its investment in all narrowband and broadband pro jects, including NOW, until market conditions improved. Then last month the firm announced it was axing 30 of the 50 London-based staff working on NOW. Following these developments, all eyes have been on NOW, to see if the reversal in PCCW's fortunes would hit the service and its content production operation, which is run by TWI. </p> <p>However, NOW head of service Rick Thomas is keen to stress that no redundancies are planned among the 400-odd content staff he oversees, and that work is continuing on developing and improving the offering. \"TWI has an agreement with PCCW to produce content that runs for some years and that has not been affected at the moment,\" says Thomas, who continues to executive produce TV shows for TWI, in addition to his NOW role. \"We're here and we're carrying on.\" </p> <p>The business-as-usual line is reinforced by deputy head of service Patrick Walker, who was working in Asia as a BBC journalist before joining NOW. \"What's been going on at PCCW is just the reality of the market right now,\" he says. \"They have given figures for what they're willing to commit on an annual basis and Richard Li is still very committed to the business-to-consumer side of the business.\" </p> <p>Thomas adds that he has always been working to a timetable that assumed an 18-month period after the June 2000 soft launch to develop NOW and roll it out globally, before moving to a hard launch. This is still the goal. </p> <p>NOW's other deputy head of service, Sarah Hicks, says one priority in the first six months since the service went live has been building the infrastructure behind it. This has included developing a dedicated NOW operating system for web and TV content production, which Hicks says combines the best elements of the ENPS TV newsroom system and Dreamweaver website building software. </p> <p>Another key development has been creating software that synchronises NOW's TV and web content, allowing users to click on a \"trigger page\" embedded in the video stream they are watching that takes them to the relevant page in one of NOW's web portals. </p> <p>In other areas of NOW's operation there has been a sharp learning curve. Hicks, a launch veteran who was in at the start of now established TV news services Sky News, BBC World and BBC News 24, admits that early plans for a multiskilled workforce who could all shoot and edit their own video footage, as well as writing accompanying scripts and web copy, have been scaled back. </p> <p>She adds that some individuals have taken to multiskilling. NOW sports reporter David McGrath, for instance, operates as a one-man TV production team, covering events overseas armed with a digital camera, laptop editor and two satellite dishes. </p> <p>But in general NOW has moved towards hiring people with good old-fashioned specialisms. Subs have been brought in to cast a beady eye over web copy, and yachting journalists have been hired to report on round-the-world catamaran event The Race for the NOW website established to cover the event. </p> <p>The NOW management team has also spent the past few months refining and improving the TV and internet content offerings. NOW launched with five individually branded web portals and complimentary TV programming strands themed around sport, gaming, film and art, earth and space, and cutting- edge music. </p> <p>The daily block of TV output broadcast from 4pm London time, which consists of 15- and 30-minute programmes, was increased from two-and-a-half to four hours a day in mid November. A sixth technology themed programming strand, Tech, was launched at the same time and the Tech website went live last week. </p> <p>Two of the portals have been rebranded, with Emage relaunched as Film and Art, and Mothership transformed into Earth and Space. Explaining the rebranding, Walker says: \"On TV you try and find funky names that hint at what a show's about. But on the web you've got to be much more specific, otherwise people just click away.\" </p> <p>NOW has also been targeting events around the world that will appeal to the communities it is looking to serve, either picking up internet rights for video streaming or providing other types of coverage in cases where footage of the event itself is not available. </p> <p>Last month NOW signed a deal with Mean Fiddler, which will allow the outfit to webcast gigs from the music event organiser's 12 UK venues. Thomas reveals that NOW is also talking to Mean Fiddler about coverage of the Reading rock festival later in the year. </p> <p>As for how much traffic the NOW service gets, Walker says PCCW is not revealing full figures. But he adds: \"Traffic has more than doubled since we relaunched the look and feel of the website on December 8\", and it is now hundreds of thousands of page views per day and millions of page views per month. </p> <p>The NOW management team is also encouraged by the email response from users, with 200 in the last week alone. \"The average time spent on the site is around 20 minutes per user,\" Walker says. \"There are real communities being built, which is encouraging from a business point of view.\" </p> <p>On the even thornier issue of how NOW will make money, Thomas says it will be looking for everything from online advertising and sponsorship to syndicating the outfit's TV content to traditional broadcasters through the PCCW and TWI sales teams. He also expects to have more TV distribution deals in place by the time of NOW's hard launch, which will provide extra potential for generating advertising and sponsorship revenue. </p> <p>\"It will be a mix of old and new economy revenue models,\" adds Walker. \"Because you can't rely on the web alone.\"</p>",

It's such an obvious idea.\" If it fails, you can depend on it that wise heads will shake sorrowfully and declare: \"It was never going to work in that format. Never had a hope. They must have gone crazy.\" </p> <p>As I write, 647,000 copies of our new magazine, Glamour, are being trucked from the printers in Tewkesbury to wholesalers and retailers, for what is the boldest and most expensive launch into the women's market since Marie Claire 11 years ago. What is revolutionary about Glamour, however, is its physical page size. Instead of the customary A4 format, the magazine is an inch and a half trimmer all round: handbag-sized. </p> <p>At a time when everything from mobile phones to Walkmans is progressively becoming miniaturised, we are banking on the appeal of a handbag-size glossy. It has exactly the same amount of content as a regular magazine, but it's much handier to read. With luck, modern young women travelling into work by tube and bus, and ricocheting between gym and cocktail bar, will appreciate the innovation. </p> <p>We have been considering launching Glamour in Britain for as long as I can remember. Glamour is Cond\u00e9 Nast's largest title in America, even bigger than our flagship, Vogue. Founded in 1937, with a monthly circulation of 2.2m, Glamour is second in size only to Cosmopolitan, but its image is sassier and less murky. Somebody once defined for me the difference between a Cosmo girl and a Glamour girl. The Cosmo girl, they suggested, usually goes to bed on the first date and probably can't remember the bloke's name the following morning. The Glamour girl makes him wait until the third date and insists he takes her shopping the next morning. </p> <p>For various reasons, we launched GQ, Vanity Fair and Traveller before Glamour, but it was always lurking in the wings - the grand slam challenge awaiting the perfect moment and a clever idea to give us market differentiation. </p> <p>The idea for a handbag-size Glamour wasn't, in fact, invented by us in Britain. It was a stroke of genius by my counterpart at Italian Cond\u00e9 Nast, Giampaolo Grandi. Glamour was launched in Italy seven years ago, initially in a conventional for mat. The title flourished but, in an intensely crowded middle market, never quite reached its potential. </p> <p>On a hunch, Grandi tested the smaller format in two of Italy's regions, Umbria and Calabria. Sales rocketed and they took the hint. Within a year, circulation had climbed by 60% and the pocket-sized Glamour was a runaway success. Readers declared it to be more accessible and, significantly, more chic. Advertisers bought into the novelty and doubled their investment. </p> <p>But would the small format play in Britain? We still weren't sure. There were numerous good reasons not to take the risk. How, we wondered, would newsagents react, and how would they display it? Would advertisers complain that a smaller page packed less punch, or expect to pay less for their space? </p> <p>We focused-grouped the format in six cities, from Bristol to Manchester, cunningly concealing our hand by showing special mini-versions of Cosmopolitan and Marie Claire. Then we hall-tested mini Glamours with a further sample of 50,000 target readers. </p> <p>Often I find focus groups annoyingly inconclusive, but this time the result was unambiguous: they loved it. \"It will fit in my handbag with my mobile,\" exclaimed person after person in Newcastle, right on cue. Our international chairman, Jonathan Newhouse, backed us to take the risk on the strength of the Italian experience. </p> <p>It was obvious that format alone wouldn't do the trick and I set about searching for an editor and a publisher. One early potential candidate I talked to was Jo Elvin, then editor of Emap's New Woman. She is a bright, streetwise Australian with an impressive track record and a certain sunny toughness I admire. </p> <p>We met for breakfast at the Halkin hotel and, about half way through the second poached egg, I had a strong instinct she was going to be the one. As a true Glamour girl, she waited until the third date, of course, before succumbing. We were having dinner in a fish restaurant called Sheekey's by this time. Just occasionally, when searching for the perfect editor, it's like the other person is reading your thoughts only putting it so much better and more vividly than you could yourself. Jo consented to be seduced to join Cond\u00e9 Nast, but I didn't take her shopping afterwards. </p> <p>The Glamour recipe, we agreed, would major on hot, wearable fashion, a lot of beauty and celebrities, plus an un-seedy weave of sex and relationships. The reader would be 15% less grubby than the Cosmo girl, 15% less earnest than Marie Claire. And she'd love clothes. </p> <p>With every new project you need a stroke of luck and this arrived in the form of Simon Kippin, the publisher. At the ceaseless round of scent launches and cosmetics par ties that are a feature of magazine life, I was always watching Kippin, then the commercial boss of Cosmopolitan, working the room and networking with advertisers. It irritated me that he didn't work for Cond\u00e9 Nast. Fortunately, after two decades at National Magazines, Kippin had decided on a change of air and we pounced on him. This week he has repaid our confidence by delivering 172 pages of advertising in Glamour's first issue (which compares with 79 pages in the launch issue of InStyle). </p> <p>With only three days to go before launch, it has stopped feeling like a phoney war. Our forces are rolling remorselessly towards the newsstands, armed and ready for action. From Wednesday we will commence carpet-bombing the nation with a \u00a34.5m spend on television, print, billboards and cinema. Special magazine stands and dispensers have been built and delivered to 30,000 newsstands. </p> <p>Not for one moment do we underestimate the strength or resolve of our competitors, but morale is high. For months now, rival publishers have been shoring up their defences with sandbags. At Glamour, we put our trust in handbags. </p> <p>\u0095 Nicholas Coleridge is managing director of Cond\u00e9 Nast</p>",

Our international chairman, Jonathan Newhouse, backed us to take the risk on the strength of the Italian experience. It was obvious that format alone wouldn't do the trick and I set about searching for an editor and a publisher. One early potential candidate I talked to was Jo Elvin, then editor of Emap's New Woman. She is a bright, streetwise Australian with an impressive track record and a certain sunny toughness I admire. We met for breakfast at the Halkin hotel and, about half way through the second poached egg, I had a strong instinct she was going to be the one. As a true Glamour girl, she waited until the third date, of course, before succumbing. We were having dinner in a fish restaurant called Sheekey's by this time. Just occasionally, when searching for the perfect editor, it's like the other person is reading your thoughts only putting it so much better and more vividly than you could yourself. Jo consented to be seduced to join Cond\u00e9 Nast, but I didn't take her shopping afterwards. The Glamour recipe, we agreed, would major on hot, wearable fashion, a lot of beauty and celebrities, plus an un-seedy weave of sex and relationships. The reader would be 15% less grubby than the Cosmo girl, 15% less earnest than Marie Claire. And she'd love clothes. With every new project you need a stroke of luck and this arrived in the form of Simon Kippin, the publisher. At the ceaseless round of scent launches and cosmetics par ties that are a feature of magazine life, I was always watching Kippin, then the commercial boss of Cosmopolitan, working the room and networking with advertisers. It irritated me that he didn't work for Cond\u00e9 Nast. Fortunately, after two decades at National Magazines, Kippin had decided on a change of air and we pounced on him. This week he has repaid our confidence by delivering 172 pages of advertising in Glamour's first issue (which compares with 79 pages in the launch issue of InStyle). With only three days to go before launch, it has stopped feeling like a phoney war. Our forces are rolling remorselessly towards the newsstands, armed and ready for action. From Wednesday we will commence carpet-bombing the nation with a \u00a34.5m spend on television, print, billboards and cinema. Special magazine stands and dispensers have been built and delivered to 30,000 newsstands. Not for one moment do we underestimate the strength or resolve of our competitors, but morale is high. For months now, rival publishers have been shoring up their defences with sandbags. At Glamour, we put our trust in handbags. \u0095 Nicholas Coleridge is managing director of Cond\u00e9 Nast",

As soon as eToys told the world it had no choice but to file for bankruptcy last Monday, it was just a matter of hours before Toyzone, Freud's baby, pulled down its site.

A few hours later, he managed to catch his flight back to London with just minutes to spare, only to arrive home and find his parents sitting on his doorstep (having turned up on the wrong day), expecting to spend some time with their bedraggled son. It never rains... </p> <p> \u0095 Once upon a time there was a massive media company; a household name no less, that caught the dot.com wave and embarked on a massive internet expansion plan. This was Disney, that was then, and layoffs and cutbacks are now. Curious then that its corporate website has not changed a jot: \"WDIG [Walt Disney Internet Group] is taking the internet by storm... it's certain that WDIG will be blowing the socks off the internet world for years to come... there's never a dull moment.\" And there's more: \"That's the kind of atmosphere that WDIG people thrive in.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Astrological warfare has broken out on the internet, and the object of everyone's affection curiously happens to be the larger-than-life astrologer Russell Grant. Grant has been wooed by Questico and UK newcomer Keen to join their competitive lists of \"experts\", but Grant is not fussy - he'll work with anyone. Already segments of Grant's \"Astrological Universe\" appear on MSN and Excite, and a staggering 5m people a month are said to visit RussellGrant.com. But even though Keen.co.uk is talking up its ties with said astro-guru, Grant's picture on its front page links to, er, nothing whatsoever to do with him. In fact, a search of the site led to abject disappointment: \"Sorry, your search on 'Russell Grant' has returned no results.\" So, it's one nil to Questico already. \u0095 Who would have thought that PR virtuoso Matthew Freud would choose his moment so well to finally wield the scythe at Toyzone.co.uk? As soon as eToys told the world it had no choice but to file for bankruptcy last Monday, it was just a matter of hours before Toyzone, Freud's baby, pulled down its site. Was this just a bizarre coincidence? No, of course not. Toyzone has been biding its time for months, and the shock news of eToys pulling the plug was just the cover it needed. If only those pesky journalists hadn't noticed! \u0095 Hapless individual of the week is Geoff Inns, business development director at Questico, who not only lost his mobile phone in a Berlin nightclub, but also spent the early hours wandering the streets of Berlin trying to remember the name of his hotel and - even though he now works for a German company - struggling to ask directions. A few hours later, he managed to catch his flight back to London with just minutes to spare, only to arrive home and find his parents sitting on his doorstep (having turned up on the wrong day), expecting to spend some time with their bedraggled son. It never rains... \u0095 Once upon a time there was a massive media company; a household name no less, that caught the dot.com wave and embarked on a massive internet expansion plan. This was Disney, that was then, and layoffs and cutbacks are now. Curious then that its corporate website has not changed a jot: \"WDIG [Walt Disney Internet Group] is taking the internet by storm... it's certain that WDIG will be blowing the socks off the internet world for years to come... there's never a dull moment.\" And there's more: \"That's the kind of atmosphere that WDIG people thrive in. It's an atmosphere of constant challenge and change - where self-starters and self-motivators are richly rewarded. In ALL areas of compensation. Including that all-important pat on the back for a job well done.\" Hindsight kind of sours the hyperbole. \u0095 Amy Vickers is new media editor of mediatheguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>William Hague announced in the Commons that he was declaring a truce with the government because of the foot and mouth crisis. Unable to grasp the meaning of ceasefire, he rather spoiled it by immediately furling his white flag and trying to extract a pledge from Tony Blair about delaying the bill to outlaw fox-hunting. </p> <p>But Hague had no real need to worry about the political consequences of a temporary suspension of hostilities. He knew he could sit back and let the government's real opposition, the Tory press, do the job for him. </p> <p>Between them, the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph tried every conceivable trick to disrupt all hopes of a genuine bipartisan understanding in the face of a national catastrophe. </p> <p>Given the apolitical nature of an animal virus, and the fact that no amount of parliamentary probing had managed to lay the blame for its arrival on the government, it required an unusual degree of subtlety to besmirch Blair's government. </p> <p>What these papers sought to create was a public perception, regardless of the facts, that Blair's cabinet was somehow guilty of causing and then mishandling the outbreak. In other words, they indulged in their favourite pastime: journalistic spin. </p> <p>The other, quite separate, underlying strand to their arguments was fascinating too because these ideologues of monopoly capital found themselves questioning the concept of modern food production dictated by the free market they so revere. </p> <p>The Mail began the week with a splash headlined: \"The Great Burning Begins But Is It Too Late?\". This rhetorical question was not a direct assault on the government, of course, but the suggestion was obvious. Inside, an editorial page feature by an academic laid into everyone connected to \"the commercial policies that rule the farming world\", including \"the government, the European Commission, the supermarkets\" and \"globalisation\". </p> <p>He was exercised by the fact that \"farming is geared unswervingly to profit\" and made an excellent case against it. Noticeably, though, having taken a swipe at the government, he offered not the slightest clue about how Blair could do a blind thing to interfere with the market. </p> <p>Next day came another ambiguous front-page headline, \"The Pariahs of Europe\", which seemed to suggest that Germany and France were misbehaving by banning British meat imports, a neat way of using the crisis to take another xenophobic rap at Blair's European sympathies. </p> <p>The main features slot was given to Edward Heathcoat-Amory, the nephew of MP David who, the Times's William Rees-Mogg informed us, \"has a real loyalty to the land\". He unleashed a blistering attack on the ministry of agriculture for turning \"a crisis into a catastrophe\". </p> <p>Again, the central thrust of his argument had some merit, but the anti-Labour political message - with a childish joke about Nick \"Newcastle\" Brown - was insistent. (It was a busy day for Mr H-A. On another page he was damning Blair for his commitment to the Euro army, a familiar Mail beef, so to speak). </p> <p>The Mail, an overwhelmingly metropolitan paper, also taunted Labour for being an \"overwhelmingly metropolitan party\" guilty of \"indifference, sometimes bordering on contempt\" for rural communities. </p> <p>On Wednesday, the Mail's leader writer was apoplectic at the government insistence on debating a hunting bill, while refusing \"to find time to discuss the most devastating threat to the countryside in a generation\". The paper screamed: \"This is the true voice of New Labour - a party that holds parliamentary democracy in contempt.\" </p> <p>It also took Brown to task for \"scurrying off to Brussels and his tours of broadcasting studios\" and concluded: \"No wonder millions of country dwellers have lost all faith in New Labour.\" </p> <p>The following day the Mail's news story - the bit where the paper supposedly relays impartial information - began: \"MPs showed astonishing contempt for Britain's farming community last night when only a handful of them took part in a debate on the foot-and-mouth catastrophe.\" </p> <p>The headline referred to \"just 13 Labour MPs\" being in the chamber while the story revealed that the Tories, who we might note are an overwhelmingly rural party and who had demanded the debate in the first place, fielded only 48. </p> <p>On Friday, the Mail found yet another way to attack Blair. At a time of national emergency, it said, ministers were \"spending an inordinate amount of time on New Labour's [election] campaign strategy\". It was therefore important for the prime minister to \"announce that there will be no early election\". </p> <p>Over a period of five days, the Mail had succeeded in pouring a huge amount of manure over Blair and his government. It wasn't the only muck-spreader, of course, with the Daily Telegraph enthusiastically shovelling the same stuff too. </p> <p>It slammed the agriculture min istry for culling abattoirs on Monday; asserted in its supposed news splash on Tuesday that Blair was relieved by the postponement of the Countryside Alliance march; questioned the need for an election on Wednesday; and reinforced that point with a Boris Johnson column on Thursday. </p> <p>The Telegraph's most tendentious assault on the government came from Tom Utley who argued that it was \"totally out of control of the crisis. Much of what it is doing is plainly fatuous, and done just for show\". </p> <p>He thought the measures adopted by the government \"frighteningly authoritarian and hopelessly ineffective\" and advocated instead a policy of doing nothing. \"There is damn all that the government can do now to stop it, until it has run its course.\" </p> <p>I just wonder how sympathetic the Telegraph would have been if Blair had greeted the original news of the outbreak in an Essex slaughterhouse by announcing that there was nothing to be done and we should go about our business as normal. It doesn't take a minute to imagine headlines such as \"Crisis, What Crisis?\" and editorials about Blair's contempt for the problems of the countryside. The Utley article was a piece of maverick nonsense. </p> <p>I also suspect that Nick Garland's cartoon in Friday's Telegraph, casting Nick Brown as Hercules struggling to conquer the Hydra, which grew two heads in place of any one chopped off, was meant to suggest the minister was facing an impossible task. But he, and Utley, would do well to remember that Hercules eventually killed the beast. </p> <p> The Mail and Telegraph were not entirely alone in their criticisms of Brown. Two parliamentary sketch-writers, Simon Hoggart of the Guardian and Matthew Parris of the Times, lampooned his Commons performance. Hoggart thought him \"a drizzlingly depressing fellow\" while Parris accused him of flying into \"a massive sulk\". </p> <p>None of this mattered to the Independent which next day talked of him as the \"forgotten minister\" who \"rose to a crisis\". The Mirror's Paul Routledge also praised Brown's impressive coolness and the wisdom of his \"judicious measures\". </p> <p>These two papers are largely sympathetic to the government, but it's always difficult to gauge how the Sun will react. This time, it accomplished a neat hat-trick, giving Blair unqualified support, taking a pot-shot at the Mail for referring to Britain as Europe's pariahs and then playing a familiar xenophobic card. </p> <p>\"Our standards of animal husbandry and food hygiene are a match for anywhere in the world,\" said the Sun. \"The trouble is that Britain is more honest than most other countries. When we have a problem, we don't try to hide it.\" </p> <p>Isn't journalistic spin a wonder to behold?</p>",

Unable to grasp the meaning of ceasefire, he rather spoiled it by immediately furling his white flag and trying to extract a pledge from Tony Blair about delaying the bill to outlaw fox-hunting. But Hague had no real need to worry about the political consequences of a temporary suspension of hostilities. He knew he could sit back and let the government's real opposition, the Tory press, do the job for him. Between them, the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph tried every conceivable trick to disrupt all hopes of a genuine bipartisan understanding in the face of a national catastrophe. Given the apolitical nature of an animal virus, and the fact that no amount of parliamentary probing had managed to lay the blame for its arrival on the government, it required an unusual degree of subtlety to besmirch Blair's government. What these papers sought to create was a public perception, regardless of the facts, that Blair's cabinet was somehow guilty of causing and then mishandling the outbreak. In other words, they indulged in their favourite pastime: journalistic spin. The other, quite separate, underlying strand to their arguments was fascinating too because these ideologues of monopoly capital found themselves questioning the concept of modern food production dictated by the free market they so revere. The Mail began the week with a splash headlined: \"The Great Burning Begins But Is It Too Late?\". This rhetorical question was not a direct assault on the government, of course, but the suggestion was obvious. Inside, an editorial page feature by an academic laid into everyone connected to \"the commercial policies that rule the farming world\", including \"the government, the European Commission, the supermarkets\" and \"globalisation\". He was exercised by the fact that \"farming is geared unswervingly to profit\" and made an excellent case against it. Noticeably, though, having taken a swipe at the government, he offered not the slightest clue about how Blair could do a blind thing to interfere with the market. Next day came another ambiguous front-page headline, \"The Pariahs of Europe\", which seemed to suggest that Germany and France were misbehaving by banning British meat imports, a neat way of using the crisis to take another xenophobic rap at Blair's European sympathies. The main features slot was given to Edward Heathcoat-Amory, the nephew of MP David who, the Times's William Rees-Mogg informed us, \"has a real loyalty to the land\". He unleashed a blistering attack on the ministry of agriculture for turning \"a crisis into a catastrophe\". Again, the central thrust of his argument had some merit, but the anti-Labour political message - with a childish joke about Nick \"Newcastle\" Brown - was insistent. (It was a busy day for Mr H-A. On another page he was damning Blair for his commitment to the Euro army, a familiar Mail beef, so to speak). The Mail, an overwhelmingly metropolitan paper, also taunted Labour for being an \"overwhelmingly metropolitan party\" guilty of \"indifference, sometimes bordering on contempt\" for rural communities. On Wednesday, the Mail's leader writer was apoplectic at the government insistence on debating a hunting bill, while refusing \"to find time to discuss the most devastating threat to the countryside in a generation\". The paper screamed: \"This is the true voice of New Labour - a party that holds parliamentary democracy in contempt.\" It also took Brown to task for \"scurrying off to Brussels and his tours of broadcasting studios\" and concluded: \"No wonder millions of country dwellers have lost all faith in New Labour.\" The following day the Mail's news story - the bit where the paper supposedly relays impartial information - began: \"MPs showed astonishing contempt for Britain's farming community last night when only a handful of them took part in a debate on the foot-and-mouth catastrophe.\" The headline referred to \"just 13 Labour MPs\" being in the chamber while the story revealed that the Tories, who we might note are an overwhelmingly rural party and who had demanded the debate in the first place, fielded only 48. On Friday, the Mail found yet another way to attack Blair. At a time of national emergency, it said, ministers were \"spending an inordinate amount of time on New Labour's [election] campaign strategy\". It was therefore important for the prime minister to \"announce that there will be no early election\". Over a period of five days, the Mail had succeeded in pouring a huge amount of manure over Blair and his government. It wasn't the only muck-spreader, of course, with the Daily Telegraph enthusiastically shovelling the same stuff too. It slammed the agriculture min istry for culling abattoirs on Monday; asserted in its supposed news splash on Tuesday that Blair was relieved by the postponement of the Countryside Alliance march; questioned the need for an election on Wednesday; and reinforced that point with a Boris Johnson column on Thursday. The Telegraph's most tendentious assault on the government came from Tom Utley who argued that it was \"totally out of control of the crisis. Much of what it is doing is plainly fatuous, and done just for show\". He thought the measures adopted by the government \"frighteningly authoritarian and hopelessly ineffective\" and advocated instead a policy of doing nothing. \"There is damn all that the government can do now to stop it, until it has run its course.\" I just wonder how sympathetic the Telegraph would have been if Blair had greeted the original news of the outbreak in an Essex slaughterhouse by announcing that there was nothing to be done and we should go about our business as normal. It doesn't take a minute to imagine headlines such as \"Crisis, What Crisis?\" and editorials about Blair's contempt for the problems of the countryside. The Utley article was a piece of maverick nonsense. I also suspect that Nick Garland's cartoon in Friday's Telegraph, casting Nick Brown as Hercules struggling to conquer the Hydra, which grew two heads in place of any one chopped off, was meant to suggest the minister was facing an impossible task. But he, and Utley, would do well to remember that Hercules eventually killed the beast. The Mail and Telegraph were not entirely alone in their criticisms of Brown. Two parliamentary sketch-writers, Simon Hoggart of the Guardian and Matthew Parris of the Times, lampooned his Commons performance. Hoggart thought him \"a drizzlingly depressing fellow\" while Parris accused him of flying into \"a massive sulk\". None of this mattered to the Independent which next day talked of him as the \"forgotten minister\" who \"rose to a crisis\". The Mirror's Paul Routledge also praised Brown's impressive coolness and the wisdom of his \"judicious measures\". These two papers are largely sympathetic to the government, but it's always difficult to gauge how the Sun will react. This time, it accomplished a neat hat-trick, giving Blair unqualified support, taking a pot-shot at the Mail for referring to Britain as Europe's pariahs and then playing a familiar xenophobic card. \"Our standards of animal husbandry and food hygiene are a match for anywhere in the world,\" said the Sun. \"The trouble is that Britain is more honest than most other countries. When we have a problem, we don't try to hide it.\" Isn't journalistic spin a wonder to behold?",

      "body": "<p>The American poet, Archie Ammons, who has died aged 75, wanted a poetry \"plain as day, exact and bright,\" in which things like saliva, the weekly waste collection, the weather forecast, and his backache were equally at home. Published in prestigious quarterlies, taken up by powerful professors, employed at an elite university, laurelled with awards and fellowships, only one element was missing in his stellar career. He never found a reading public.</p> <p>Ammons wrote every day in his study in Ithaca, New York, where he taught poetry at Cornell University, his daily routine providing the subject and occasion of his writing. He belonged to the generation of postwar writers for whom the cultural megalomania of a figure like Ezra Pound, and the theological and cultural agenda of TS Eliot, had little appeal. He lacked the pizzazz and showmanship from which public careers in poetry are built.</p> <p>Ammons was not interested in ideas, politics, civic life or cultural heritage - because he did not engage with such things, he was literally, as a poet, speaking to no one. \"I don't address an already defined stratum of society or a particular cause,\" he told an interviewer. \"I think of the hermit lark, a shy bird with an unlocatable, indescribable sound.\"</p> <p>In 1971, Harold Bloom published an essay in which he placed Ammons in the line of descent from Emerson, Whitman and Wallace Stevens. With Bloom's patronage, critics could see how Ammons's meditations upon landscape and the weather were firmly within the tradition of American transcendentalism.</p> <p>He preferred open forms, unrhymed short lines, short paragraphs, and a personal tone. Closure, formal intricacy, sensual delight in verbal dexterity, or even \"meaning\", were not his strongpoint. Buying a roll of adding-machine tape on im pulse in 1963, he fed it into his typewriter and began a poem:</p> <p>6 Dec:</p> <p>today I</p> <p>decided to write</p> <p>a long</p> <p>thin</p> <p>poem</p> <p>By the time he had finished 13 months later (he used a wastebasket to hold the completed text), he had a verse journal, a record of dailiness, weather reports and reflections upon the ordinary business of writing verse.</p> <p>Tape For The Turn Of The Year, published in 1965, 200 pages long and consisting of a single sentence, bemused reviewers, and beguiled some by its plain, unfeigning tone:</p> <p>the reason I write so much</p> <p>is</p> <p>that I can't do anything</p> <p>else:</p> <p>poem must be now</p> <p>close to 40 feet long:</p> <p>He meant this quite literally. By that point, the tape was too long to be removed from his typewriter. He was a prisoner of his poem, and had to go until the tape was done.</p> <p>Ammons came from the poor-white, southern world photographed by Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange during the depression. He grew up on a farm in Columbus County, North Carolina, miles from the nearest paved road. His father grew tobacco and corn, and raised chickens, cows and pigs. There was no one to tell his family that they were white trash - civilisation was too far away.</p> <p>As the depression hit subsistence farmers, the Ammons family sank deeper into debt. He himself felt his grade school was strange; it was painted inside, and there were electric lights and a flushing toilet. At high school, he was poorer than the other students, and felt excluded from the world of \"town kids\".</p> <p>The second world war opened up new opportunities. After graduating from high school, Ammons got a job in the shipyards at Wilmington. The family farm was sold, debts paid off. At the age of 18, he joined the US naval reserve, and served on a ship in the Pacific. He began to write poetry during quiet moments at sea. Taking advantage of the GI Bill, he studied biology at Wake Forest College. After graduating in 1949, he married Phyllis Plumbo, who shared his interest in poetry.</p> <p>In the early 1950s, Ammons went to the University of California, Berkeley, where he was encouraged by the poet Josephine Miles. He continued to write poems while working for a decade as an executive of a biological glass manufacturing company in New Jersey. His first book, Ommateum, appeared in 1955, to be followed by Expressions Of Sea Level (1964) and Corson's Inlet (1965), which established a reputation. In 1964, he began teaching poetry writing at Cornell, and spent the remainder of his career as a poet-teacher.</p> <p>Ammons went on to publish nearly 30 books, winning nearly every major American award for poetry, including the National Book Award for his Collected Poems in 1973, and, in 1993, for Garbage, a long meditation upon a smouldering mountain of trash in Florida.

      "bodyText": "The American poet, Archie Ammons, who has died aged 75, wanted a poetry \"plain as day, exact and bright,\" in which things like saliva, the weekly waste collection, the weather forecast, and his backache were equally at home. Published in prestigious quarterlies, taken up by powerful professors, employed at an elite university, laurelled with awards and fellowships, only one element was missing in his stellar career. He never found a reading public. Ammons wrote every day in his study in Ithaca, New York, where he taught poetry at Cornell University, his daily routine providing the subject and occasion of his writing. He belonged to the generation of postwar writers for whom the cultural megalomania of a figure like Ezra Pound, and the theological and cultural agenda of TS Eliot, had little appeal. He lacked the pizzazz and showmanship from which public careers in poetry are built. Ammons was not interested in ideas, politics, civic life or cultural heritage - because he did not engage with such things, he was literally, as a poet, speaking to no one. \"I don't address an already defined stratum of society or a particular cause,\" he told an interviewer. \"I think of the hermit lark, a shy bird with an unlocatable, indescribable sound.\" In 1971, Harold Bloom published an essay in which he placed Ammons in the line of descent from Emerson, Whitman and Wallace Stevens. With Bloom's patronage, critics could see how Ammons's meditations upon landscape and the weather were firmly within the tradition of American transcendentalism. He preferred open forms, unrhymed short lines, short paragraphs, and a personal tone. Closure, formal intricacy, sensual delight in verbal dexterity, or even \"meaning\", were not his strongpoint. Buying a roll of adding-machine tape on im pulse in 1963, he fed it into his typewriter and began a poem: 6 Dec: today I decided to write a long thin poem By the time he had finished 13 months later (he used a wastebasket to hold the completed text), he had a verse journal, a record of dailiness, weather reports and reflections upon the ordinary business of writing verse. Tape For The Turn Of The Year, published in 1965, 200 pages long and consisting of a single sentence, bemused reviewers, and beguiled some by its plain, unfeigning tone: the reason I write so much is that I can't do anything else: poem must be now close to 40 feet long: He meant this quite literally. By that point, the tape was too long to be removed from his typewriter. He was a prisoner of his poem, and had to go until the tape was done. Ammons came from the poor-white, southern world photographed by Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange during the depression. He grew up on a farm in Columbus County, North Carolina, miles from the nearest paved road. His father grew tobacco and corn, and raised chickens, cows and pigs. There was no one to tell his family that they were white trash - civilisation was too far away. As the depression hit subsistence farmers, the Ammons family sank deeper into debt. He himself felt his grade school was strange; it was painted inside, and there were electric lights and a flushing toilet. At high school, he was poorer than the other students, and felt excluded from the world of \"town kids\". The second world war opened up new opportunities. After graduating from high school, Ammons got a job in the shipyards at Wilmington. The family farm was sold, debts paid off. At the age of 18, he joined the US naval reserve, and served on a ship in the Pacific. He began to write poetry during quiet moments at sea. Taking advantage of the GI Bill, he studied biology at Wake Forest College. After graduating in 1949, he married Phyllis Plumbo, who shared his interest in poetry. In the early 1950s, Ammons went to the University of California, Berkeley, where he was encouraged by the poet Josephine Miles. He continued to write poems while working for a decade as an executive of a biological glass manufacturing company in New Jersey. His first book, Ommateum, appeared in 1955, to be followed by Expressions Of Sea Level (1964) and Corson's Inlet (1965), which established a reputation. In 1964, he began teaching poetry writing at Cornell, and spent the remainder of his career as a poet-teacher. Ammons went on to publish nearly 30 books, winning nearly every major American award for poetry, including the National Book Award for his Collected Poems in 1973, and, in 1993, for Garbage, a long meditation upon a smouldering mountain of trash in Florida. His last book, Glare, appeared in 1997. He is survived by his wife and a son, John. Archie Randolph Ammons, poet, born February 18 1926; died February 25 2001",

I detest first-scorer betting: with the exception of no goalscorer, I see no virtue in it. Bookmakers give themselves big margins on this particular market, and the appearance of substitutes before a goal is scored just adds to their edge. It is very rare to be able to try and buck percentages of 150 or more profitably. As a general rule, I would avoid this option.</p> <p>Having said all that, with my hand tied behind my back and a gun pointed to my head, your selection of James Beattie was a logical one. It could easily be envisaged that he would give the ancient Manchester City central defence a nightmarish day: he is big, strong, quick and mobile - just the sort of striker the Blues have struggled with all season. Unfortunately, he was replaced after 30 minutes following a clash with Richard Dunne, thus ending all hopes of a winning bet. Not getting 90 minutes for your money hmm perhaps I should have included that in my anti-first goalscorer diatribe. In fact, the Saints, second behind only Manchester United in the six-match form table, were perhaps the best betting option in this match at a best price of 7/4.</p> <p>Your alternative bet, Dundee to be leading at St Johnstone at the interval, certainly had some merit. St Johnstone have the poorest home record in the Premiership, and Dundee's away record is far superior to their home form. Although hindsight is a valuable tool for the fledgling betting analyst, I would always prefer betting on a 90-minute outcome, as half-time betting is altogether too random for my taste. But St Johnstone's abysmal form since the return from the mid-season break made them poor favourites at around 11/10, and Dundee had to be considered at a best-priced 2/1. (Dundee won 3-2.)</p> <p><strong>Sean Ingle: \u00a310 treble - Celta Vigo v Real Oviedo: Celta to win @ 4/7; Stockport v Wimbledon: Wimbledon to win @ 11/8; Bristol City v Oxford: Bristol City to win @ 1/3</strong><br> Bet lost; Celta beat Oviedo 1-0, Stockport drew 2-2 with Wimbledon and Oxford held Bristol City to a 0-0 draw</p> <p>Thank you for your kind welcome. But as for your value treble, I think you were treading on very unsafe territory. I did like the Celta Vigo selection: BlueSq were best price at 4/7 and that certainly looked value. Ovideo are certainly a different proposition at home, but they are truly woeful on their travels; and with Celta's recent improvement, this certainly had the look of a home banker.</p> <p>And Bristol City should certainly have beaten a very poor Oxford side. But whether they were value at 1/3 is a moot point. I rate City's strikeforce of Tony Thorpe and Lee Peacock very highly, but they haven't been scoring as frequently as I would have expected, and their recent form has left a lot to be desired of a team with play-off pretensions. Their previous two games saw defeats at the hands of Colchester (4-0!) and Brentford. Backing any team who could lose to such moderate opposition is clearly a risky venture, particularly at such prohibitive odds.</p> <p>I certainly could not have made a selection in the Stockport v Wimbledon clash. While agreeing that the Dons are certainly a better proposition on their travels than at a sparsely attended Selhurst Park, I personally think they are flattered by their mid-table position in the First Division. Their form rarely rises above mediocre, and although they have been impressive recently in dispatching very poor sides in the shape of Sheffield Wednesday and Queen's Park Rangers, their overall profile is of a team that may struggle to survive in the First Division next term. Especially, as seems likely, their remaining Premiership-standard players, Jason Euell and Marcus Gayle depart in the summer.</p> <p>When you add Stockport's dire need for a good result in this match and Aaron Wilbrahim's recent upturn in form, I would have more tempted to include Stockport at 7/4 than Wimbledon at 11/8.</p> <p><strong>The Prince of Punts: Parma to beat AC Milan \u00a35 @ 11/4</strong><br> Bet lost; the match ended in a 2-2 draw</p> <p>Milan against Parma had all the hallmarks of a low-scoring, dour affair. Parma have indeed been in excellent recent form, as you mention - thumping two poor sides, in the shape of Peruigia and Brescia, at home in recent outings.</p> <p>But away from home, they are a different proposition. They play a very defensive, cagey strategy, often leaving the admirable Sergio Conceicao on the bench. They are very strong at the back, with the towering Fabio Cannavaro and the excellent Lilian Thuram often starring. So from my point of view, the outcome of this match depended on whether Oliver Bierhoff and Andriy Shevchenko could get the better of a rearguard which had only conceded nine goals away from home prior to this match. </p> <p>Milan are formidable at home, only having lost one of their 10 outings thus far. I would have expected a low-scoring affair to be settled by one goal, if at all. The value option to me was 0 or 1 goals at 5/2. But the no goalscorer bet available at 13/2 was also appealing.</p> <p><strong>Martin Lawson of the Guardian Unlimited Punters Collective: Derby to draw with Tottenham - \u00a35 @ 9/4</strong><br> Bet lost; Derby beat Spurs 2-1</p> <p>Tottenham's away travails of this season have been well documented. True, they managed to beat a very poor Manchester City team on their last outing, but all season they have been one to oppose away from White Hart Lane. They show little enterprise, and regularly concede all hope at the concession of an early goal.</p> <p>The surprise absence of Sergei Rebrov, which you could not have forseen, meant Spurs would be playing with Les Ferdinand and Andy Booth as their strikeforce, and while individually they are both very good players, their style is too similar to be a frightening proposition for the home defence.</p> <p>Derby's home form is the reason they are still odds-on to remain in the Premiership next season. Malcolm Christie and Branko Strupar have provided more than their fair share of goals, and Seth Johnson and Craig Burley are a very effective midfield combination.</p> <p>On the whole, I prefer to oppose teams who seem to have given up on their league season, into which category Spurs almost certainly fall. Safely above the relegation zone, yet surely too far away to challenge for a European place, Spurs look all set to concentrate on their FA Cup challenge, while Derby need to pick up every point available at Pride Park. This would have been a home win selection for me.</p>",

In fact, the Saints, second behind only Manchester United in the six-match form table, were perhaps the best betting option in this match at a best price of 7/4. Your alternative bet, Dundee to be leading at St Johnstone at the interval, certainly had some merit. St Johnstone have the poorest home record in the Premiership, and Dundee's away record is far superior to their home form. Although hindsight is a valuable tool for the fledgling betting analyst, I would always prefer betting on a 90-minute outcome, as half-time betting is altogether too random for my taste. But St Johnstone's abysmal form since the return from the mid-season break made them poor favourites at around 11/10, and Dundee had to be considered at a best-priced 2/1. (Dundee won 3-2.) Sean Ingle: \u00a310 treble - Celta Vigo v Real Oviedo: Celta to win @ 4/7; Stockport v Wimbledon: Wimbledon to win @ 11/8; Bristol City v Oxford: Bristol City to win @ 1/3 Bet lost; Celta beat Oviedo 1-0, Stockport drew 2-2 with Wimbledon and Oxford held Bristol City to a 0-0 draw Thank you for your kind welcome. But as for your value treble, I think you were treading on very unsafe territory. I did like the Celta Vigo selection: BlueSq were best price at 4/7 and that certainly looked value. Ovideo are certainly a different proposition at home, but they are truly woeful on their travels; and with Celta's recent improvement, this certainly had the look of a home banker. And Bristol City should certainly have beaten a very poor Oxford side. But whether they were value at 1/3 is a moot point. I rate City's strikeforce of Tony Thorpe and Lee Peacock very highly, but they haven't been scoring as frequently as I would have expected, and their recent form has left a lot to be desired of a team with play-off pretensions. Their previous two games saw defeats at the hands of Colchester (4-0!) and Brentford. Backing any team who could lose to such moderate opposition is clearly a risky venture, particularly at such prohibitive odds. I certainly could not have made a selection in the Stockport v Wimbledon clash. While agreeing that the Dons are certainly a better proposition on their travels than at a sparsely attended Selhurst Park, I personally think they are flattered by their mid-table position in the First Division. Their form rarely rises above mediocre, and although they have been impressive recently in dispatching very poor sides in the shape of Sheffield Wednesday and Queen's Park Rangers, their overall profile is of a team that may struggle to survive in the First Division next term. Especially, as seems likely, their remaining Premiership-standard players, Jason Euell and Marcus Gayle depart in the summer. When you add Stockport's dire need for a good result in this match and Aaron Wilbrahim's recent upturn in form, I would have more tempted to include Stockport at 7/4 than Wimbledon at 11/8. The Prince of Punts: Parma to beat AC Milan \u00a35 @ 11/4 Bet lost; the match ended in a 2-2 draw Milan against Parma had all the hallmarks of a low-scoring, dour affair. Parma have indeed been in excellent recent form, as you mention - thumping two poor sides, in the shape of Peruigia and Brescia, at home in recent outings. But away from home, they are a different proposition. They play a very defensive, cagey strategy, often leaving the admirable Sergio Conceicao on the bench. They are very strong at the back, with the towering Fabio Cannavaro and the excellent Lilian Thuram often starring. So from my point of view, the outcome of this match depended on whether Oliver Bierhoff and Andriy Shevchenko could get the better of a rearguard which had only conceded nine goals away from home prior to this match. Milan are formidable at home, only having lost one of their 10 outings thus far. I would have expected a low-scoring affair to be settled by one goal, if at all. The value option to me was 0 or 1 goals at 5/2. But the no goalscorer bet available at 13/2 was also appealing. Martin Lawson of the Guardian Unlimited Punters Collective: Derby to draw with Tottenham - \u00a35 @ 9/4 Bet lost; Derby beat Spurs 2-1 Tottenham's away travails of this season have been well documented. True, they managed to beat a very poor Manchester City team on their last outing, but all season they have been one to oppose away from White Hart Lane. They show little enterprise, and regularly concede all hope at the concession of an early goal. The surprise absence of Sergei Rebrov, which you could not have forseen, meant Spurs would be playing with Les Ferdinand and Andy Booth as their strikeforce, and while individually they are both very good players, their style is too similar to be a frightening proposition for the home defence. Derby's home form is the reason they are still odds-on to remain in the Premiership next season. Malcolm Christie and Branko Strupar have provided more than their fair share of goals, and Seth Johnson and Craig Burley are a very effective midfield combination. On the whole, I prefer to oppose teams who seem to have given up on their league season, into which category Spurs almost certainly fall. Safely above the relegation zone, yet surely too far away to challenge for a European place, Spurs look all set to concentrate on their FA Cup challenge, while Derby need to pick up every point available at Pride Park. This would have been a home win selection for me.",

Sources close to the media group said a bid for the company was \"far down the track\", even though DirecTV owner General Motors has effectively told News Corp to rethink its offer. \"A bid for EchoStar has never been off the cards, but it is far down the track. At the moment, News Corp is completely intent on DirecTV,\" said the source. The source said that News Corp's interest in EchoStar is no great surprise, as Mr Murdoch has always talked about being interested in more than one US satellite broadcaster. \"I don't see News Corp moving. Its talks are with General Motors, [DirecTV holding company] Hughes Electronics and no one else,\" added the source. Analysts are already downgrading News Corp's shares amid mounting speculation that the \u00a349bn bid to merge the company's satellite assets with DirecTV will fail. GM is unhappy with an all-share deal which has no cash component and is understood to be offering DirecTV and Hughes Electronics to other potential bidders. GM is desperate for cash as it experiences a slump in car sales due to a downturn in the US economy and it sees market share slipping away in the European market. But News Corp insiders said that companies such as Disney and Comcast have already looked at DirecTV and have decided not to join the fray. News that EchoStar is being lined up as a safety net will be given a subdued reception, as it has 4m subscribers against DirecTV's 9m and it does not have the technological backing of Hughes Electronics. Echostar is a privately owned company, controlled by chairman Charles Ergen who owns 90% of the stock.

      "body": "<p>The custody battle for the twins at the heart of the internet adoption scandal was mired in new controversy last night when it emerged that they could be sent back to authorities in the US within weeks. </p> <p>Legal experts believe that continued court battles in the US will force British authorities to pass judgment on the twins' case within weeks, handing them to American officials \"within a month\". </p> <p>The Welsh couple Alan and Judith Kilshaw, who claim they rightfully bought the twins from an American internet adoption agency, await the judgment of Birmingham high court over their application to become the twins' guardians. </p> <p>But last week a court in St Louis, Missouri, ruled that the twins should be returned to the country of their birth where two court battles - in Arkansas and Missouri - over their adoption are continuing. It is now up to the judge in Birmingham to send the twins back. </p> <p>'The likelihood is that they will return to the US,' said Deborah Cullen, an adoption lawyer and legal spokeswoman for British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering. 'Unless there is some subtle argument for the the Kilshaws being granted custody, Birmingham High Court will hear the case within weeks and you could see them move to the US within a month.' </p> <p>Judith Kilshaw admitted yesterday that she and her husband were not going to win the Birmingham court case, the next hearing of which is scheduled for 19 March, adding that the decision had, in her opinion, already been taken against them at 'higher levels'. </p> <p>'There's a political agenda' she said. 'If I won, it would say that it is all right to adopt from the US. </p> <p>'I wouldn't call [the latest] US court decision a judgment - it's more a request. I think the twins should be sent back to Arkansas - that's where the paperwork and the judges are. I don't want them to go back to Tranda [Wecker, their birth mother]. [She made] allegations that I smell. I put perfume on and we bathe like normal people.' </p> <p>The likelihood of yet another move for the twins will anger campaigners who believe that their repeated moving between foster parents and social services has unnecessarily added to the disruption the eight-month-old girls have experienced. The twins could leave the care of British social services, to be passed to another temporary foster family in the US, before being found a final foster home. </p> <p>This would give the girls five sets of foster parents in a matter of months. </p> <p>Recriminations and controversy continue to surround the battle for the twins.

      "bodyText": "The custody battle for the twins at the heart of the internet adoption scandal was mired in new controversy last night when it emerged that they could be sent back to authorities in the US within weeks. Legal experts believe that continued court battles in the US will force British authorities to pass judgment on the twins' case within weeks, handing them to American officials \"within a month\". The Welsh couple Alan and Judith Kilshaw, who claim they rightfully bought the twins from an American internet adoption agency, await the judgment of Birmingham high court over their application to become the twins' guardians. But last week a court in St Louis, Missouri, ruled that the twins should be returned to the country of their birth where two court battles - in Arkansas and Missouri - over their adoption are continuing. It is now up to the judge in Birmingham to send the twins back. 'The likelihood is that they will return to the US,' said Deborah Cullen, an adoption lawyer and legal spokeswoman for British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering. 'Unless there is some subtle argument for the the Kilshaws being granted custody, Birmingham High Court will hear the case within weeks and you could see them move to the US within a month.' Judith Kilshaw admitted yesterday that she and her husband were not going to win the Birmingham court case, the next hearing of which is scheduled for 19 March, adding that the decision had, in her opinion, already been taken against them at 'higher levels'. 'There's a political agenda' she said. 'If I won, it would say that it is all right to adopt from the US. 'I wouldn't call [the latest] US court decision a judgment - it's more a request. I think the twins should be sent back to Arkansas - that's where the paperwork and the judges are. I don't want them to go back to Tranda [Wecker, their birth mother]. [She made] allegations that I smell. I put perfume on and we bathe like normal people.' The likelihood of yet another move for the twins will anger campaigners who believe that their repeated moving between foster parents and social services has unnecessarily added to the disruption the eight-month-old girls have experienced. The twins could leave the care of British social services, to be passed to another temporary foster family in the US, before being found a final foster home. This would give the girls five sets of foster parents in a matter of months. Recriminations and controversy continue to surround the battle for the twins. Judith Kilshaw claimed that Tina Johnson, who sold the girls to both the Kilshaws and another couple in California - Richard and Vicky Allen - through her internet adoption agency, was now being offered film and book deals for her story. Richard Allen has subsequently been charged with sexually abusing two other girls. He denies the charges.",

The cash, currently being negotiated by the Treasury, Downing Street and spending departments, is seen as a high-profile commitment to public services. </p> <p>The package, likely to be finalised in meetings tonight, would be used to fund a pay scheme to encourage retired teachers to return to work, or to encourage supply teachers to work permanently. </p> <p>The education secretary, David Blunkett, believes levels of teacher training are acceptable, but there is a serious problem of teacher shortages in classrooms. </p> <p>Jack Straw also wants extra cash to fund his package to recruit extra police and ease housing problems. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, is looking for money to ease continuing bed blocking in the NHS and meet targets for reducing cancelled operations. </p> <p>Tony Blair is understood to be supporting the key workers package, partly because he believes it will be attractive to middle income, middle-aged Britain. </p> <p>Some Labour strategists believe Mr Brown's Budget is excessively targeted at welfare benefit reforms to help the poor, many of whom do not bother to vote. </p> <p>The package can in part be funded from \u00a32.8bn savings in the social security budget generated by lower than predicted unemployment. </p> <p>The extra cash for health is despite figures due to be published today showing NHS waiting lists rose by little over 5,000 in January, ensuring the government will meet its target to cut waiting lists by 100,000 at the time of a May election. Waiting lists are 120,000 below the figure at the time of the 1997 election. If the waiting lists had risen by as much as 11,000 - in line with January 2000 - the government's flagship pledge would have been in serious danger.

The extra spending for 2001-02 is on top of the generous allocations set out in last summer's spending review. The cash, currently being negotiated by the Treasury, Downing Street and spending departments, is seen as a high-profile commitment to public services. The package, likely to be finalised in meetings tonight, would be used to fund a pay scheme to encourage retired teachers to return to work, or to encourage supply teachers to work permanently. The education secretary, David Blunkett, believes levels of teacher training are acceptable, but there is a serious problem of teacher shortages in classrooms. Jack Straw also wants extra cash to fund his package to recruit extra police and ease housing problems. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, is looking for money to ease continuing bed blocking in the NHS and meet targets for reducing cancelled operations. Tony Blair is understood to be supporting the key workers package, partly because he believes it will be attractive to middle income, middle-aged Britain. Some Labour strategists believe Mr Brown's Budget is excessively targeted at welfare benefit reforms to help the poor, many of whom do not bother to vote. The package can in part be funded from \u00a32.8bn savings in the social security budget generated by lower than predicted unemployment. The extra cash for health is despite figures due to be published today showing NHS waiting lists rose by little over 5,000 in January, ensuring the government will meet its target to cut waiting lists by 100,000 at the time of a May election. Waiting lists are 120,000 below the figure at the time of the 1997 election. If the waiting lists had risen by as much as 11,000 - in line with January 2000 - the government's flagship pledge would have been in serious danger. The number of operations cancelled in January was 0.8%. The bulk of the chancellor's measures will be aimed at cutting fuel duty and increasing the basic rate for pensioners by \u00a35 for single people and \u00a38 for couples and offering respite in fuel duty. In last December's pre-budget report he earmarked \u00a31.75bn for pensions and fuel. But the Budget will also contain a populist commitment to remove betting tax, replacing it with profits tax on the betting firms. The new children's credit, available to 5m poorer families, is to be set at a maximum \u00a3520 - \u00a310 a week. In an attempt to broaden the Budget's appeal, Mr Brown is also expected to bow to pressure from Tony Blair and offer a token income tax cut for the middle classes. He will enlarge the slice of income covered by the 10p starting rate of tax by an extra \u00a3500, a move that would save the average household \u00a360 a year. He has rejected calls from within the Downing Street policy unit for a 1p cut in the basic rate of tax, which would cost almost \u00a33bn. Although Mr Brown is on course to chalk up a record \u00a318bn government surplus this fiscal year, he has consistently ruled out a giveaway budget that might prevent the Bank of England from cutting interest rates again. Thanks to a buoyant economy which has boosted tax revenues and kept spending on unemployment low, Mr Brown should still be able to announce that he is banking \u00a316bn of his surplus.

      "body": "<p>The soaring suicide rate among young men, which means they are now more likely to die by their own hand than be killed in a car crash, will this week be confronted by a new parliamentary committee set up to investigate the scale of the tragedy. </p> <p>The suicide rate for young men has doubled since the early 80s, while for women it has almost halved. Suicide is now the biggest single cause of death of men aged 25 to 34, who are more than five times likely to take their lives as women of the same age, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. The all party group on men's health is so alarmed that in its inaugural meeting it will press for measures to ensure that suicidal young men can find help. The launch is being supported by public health minister Yvette Cooper. Howard Stoate, chairman of the men's health group, said: 'It's the commonest cause of death among young men. It's an important issue and is under-recognised - most people have no idea it is so high - but the statistics are shocking.' </p> <p>Overall, suicide has overtaken car accidents as a cause of death among men. Each year about 3,600 men take their lives, compared to 1,200 women. Dr Ian Banks, chairman of the Men's Health Forum, which advises the government, said: 'If this rate of death among young men was an infection, there would have been a lot more attention paid to it.' </p> <p>The new measures will come too late to help Mike Whitaker, who seemed to have everything to live for. He was in his last year of a chemistry degree at Bath University and was expected to get a first. He had a job lined up, a girlfriend and was captain of the clay pigeon shooting team. \"He was very successful at whatever he did,\" said his mother, Jenny Whitaker. </p> <p>But one morning at the end of the Christmas break, Jenny awoke to find the car gone, while her husband found the back door open. Then they saw a one-line handwritten note against the bedroom door of Mark's younger brother:\"'Sorry bro - look after Mum and Dad.\" Half an hour later the police found him in the car with a pipe from the exhaust to the window. </p> <p>\"We were astounded. We knew he was upset about a university project, but we had no idea he was that ill.' said his mother. \"He was a perfectionist and did keep things to himself. He hadn't spoken to anyone about being desperately distressed.\"</p> <p>Simon Armson, chief executive of the Samaritans, said that this refusal to talk about problems is a key reason why men are more likely to kill themselves than women. \"They are more likely to internalise feelings until it gets too big a burden to bear, and then it leads to self-destruction. The British culture of stiff upper lip still reigns supreme,\" he said. The Samaritans has tried to target men by advertisements on beer mats and in changing rooms. </p> <p>Declan Curran, 13, hanged himself from a door with a guitar strap. He had been sexually abused and had no one he could talk to. \"As a lad you have to be tough, and if you're not you're a bit of an outcast,\" said his brother Liam. There is a huge range in suicide rates among different groups of men. It is far higher - and rising - among unskilled men than among professional men. Men are more likely to kill themselves if they are from ethnic minorities, unmarried or gay. </p> <p>Psycholgists say that the rise in suicide among men is a result of their loss of a role in society. Dale Peters, a market trader selling plants and flowers, hanged himself at 25 after splitting up with his girlfriend. \"He found it difficult to see where he was going. He was ticking over with a small business, but he wasn't doing particularly well - he didn't see a future for himself,\" said his father, John Peters, who teaches psychology and works for the self-help group Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide. \"Many men have expectations they should be providers, and for a small percentage they don't live up to it.\"</p> <p>Males are falling behind females at school and university. The loss of unskilled jobs has hit men with few educational qualifications particularly hard. \"Young men cannot see what their role is, and often their parents cannot see what their role is,\" said Peters. \"The men can be perfectly sane in coming to that decision. For so many it is a very determined act.\" </p> <p>More women than men attempt suicide each year, but are less likely to succeed. They usually choose methods such as an overdose of pills which can often be tackled in casualty wards, and are often seen as pleas for help. Men tend to choose violent, decisive methods, such as hanging, jumping off buildings, crashing a car or shooting themselves. </p> <p>\"There's fatalism about the whole thing. People say they're going to do it anyway, but that's just not true,' said Banks. 'There are many practical things we can do.

      "byline": "Paul Brown",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>Why do we need to slaughter infected animals?</b> <p>The first reason is to stop the disease spreading, the second is economic. The virus is virulent and would spread through the entire population of cloven-hoof animals. Although nearly 50,000 animals, mostly sheep, have already been killed in this outbreak to prevent an epidemic, millions more would eventually be infected. There are 40m sheep and 10m cattle in Britain, plus domestic and wild pigs, deer and goats. Normally live animals are exported for breeding, and thousands of sheep for slaughter, but all this trade has been stopped and could never resume to countries free of foot and mouth if we did not eradicate this disease. </p> <p><b>What effect does foot and mouth have on animals?</b> </p> <p>Although most animals do recover, about 5% of young and older animals die. Animals get sore mouths and feet, and stop eating as much, and so do not gain weight; cows' milk yield goes down. Animals go lame and in some cases get severe foot infections which would lead to slaughter to prevent suffering. These losses could make farms uneconomic. </p> <p><b>How long would it last if allowed to run its course?</b> </p> <p>Each outbreak would last only a few weeks in each farm before the animals appeared well. Vaccination of other herds and flocks which had not had the disease would protect them against infection and illness. Millions of shots of vaccine are in stock. The problem is that this accepts the disease is here to stay. Foot and mouth in the national herd bars animal exports to \"clean\" countries because of fear of infection. Slaughter is a controversial policy but kept the UK foot and mouth-free for 20 years. It remains British and EU policy, although it could be reviewed once the outbreak is over, or if the disease keeps recurring in Europe. Greece has had outbreaks twice in five years. </p> <p><b>What happened in the last outbreaks?</b> </p> <p>In 1967 400,000 animals were slaughtered and the disease took six months to get under control. In 1981 there was one outbreak in the Isle of Wight. </p> <p><b>Why has it arrived after 20 years?</b> </p> <p>There is a worldwide epidemic of a virulent virus of foot and mouth called Type O which reached 60 countries in 1999. South America, South Africa and Asia have all had outbreaks. The immense increase in free trade - making import restrictions more difficult - means infected meat is traded round the world. That makes more countries vulnerable to outbreaks. Once present it spreads very quickly and can travel more than 100 miles as an airborne infection. </p> <p><b>Can humans catch the disease from animals?</b> </p> <p>Yes, but very rarely and only thought to be by direct handling of sick animals. There were cases in the 1960s epidemic and children under 10 are most likely to suffer. In humans it is like flu but with an added sore mouth. People must be kept in quarantine until they have recovered. </p> <p><b>Would the meat of animals with foot and mouth be infected?</b> </p> <p>Yes. This is the most likely way the infection came to Britain in the first case. Imports of meat from countries with foot and mouth are banned but infected meat fed to pigs in Northumberland in swill is regarded as the most likely cause of the outbreak, although the cause is still under investigation. Food containing the virus brought in from another country and carelessly thrown away in Britain is another possible cause. Countries must be disease-free for six months before exports are allowed. For infected meat to have reached Britain some illegal practice must have occurred. </p> <p><b>What would the effect on humans be from eating infected meat?</b> </p> <p>None. Properly cooked meat kills the virus and it would not be in sufficient quantities to get past the human defence system. Animals are far more susceptible. </p> <p><b>What about wild animals?</b> </p> <p>These are far less likely than farm animals to catch foot and mouth because they have less contact with infected animals. The rapid spread of infection so far has been caused by the mixing of sheep in markets and transporting them long distances crowded in lorries. If wild boar did get foot and mouth they would be the most likely wild animal to spread the disease because, like domestic pigs, they \"shed\" large quantities of virus . But experts think infection of wild animals is unlikely. Culling poses difficulties because frightened animals are likely to disperse, spreading the infection further than leaving them alone would do. </p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\"> Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\"> Interactive guide: tracing the epidemic</a></p> <p><b>Farmer's diary</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,  444639,00.html\">01.03.2001: At least the milkman gets through</a> </p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,  444735,00.html\">01.03.2001: Threat to census as disease cases grow</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,444711,00.htm  l\">01.03.2001: Crippled industry may cost economy \u00a31bn loss</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,444667,00.htm  l\">Europe awaits crucial findings</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html\">Computerised image of the virus</a> </p> <p> <b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html  \">The story in pictures</a> </p> <p> <b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">Wh at do you think?</a></p> <p> <b>Background</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,441  031,00.html \">21.02.2001, the issue explained: Foot and mouth disease</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,  444676,00.html\">01.03.200: How fragile virus can weak havoc</a></p> <p><b>The food we eat</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,  444130,00.html\">28.02.2001: Global trade forces exodus from land</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,  444099,00.html\">28.02.2001: Bleak future for small farms</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,  443984,00.html\">28.02.2001: Switch to local suppliers urged to end crisis</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,19147  3,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd\" target=\"_new\">MAFF information and factsheets</a><br> <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/eur-  lex/en/lif/dat/1985/en_385L0511.html\" target=\"_new\">EU legislation on the disease</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk/info/f&amp;ml.asp\" target=\"_new\">Latest news from the NFU</a><br><a href=\"http://www.mlc.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Meat and livestock commission</a><br><a href=\"http://www.npa-uk.net\" target=\"_new\">National Pig Association</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.oie.int/eng/maladies/fiches/A_A010.HTM\" target=\"_new\">World organisation for animal health: foot and mouth disease</a></p>",

What happened in the last outbreaks? In 1967 400,000 animals were slaughtered and the disease took six months to get under control. In 1981 there was one outbreak in the Isle of Wight. Why has it arrived after 20 years? There is a worldwide epidemic of a virulent virus of foot and mouth called Type O which reached 60 countries in 1999. South America, South Africa and Asia have all had outbreaks. The immense increase in free trade - making import restrictions more difficult - means infected meat is traded round the world. That makes more countries vulnerable to outbreaks. Once present it spreads very quickly and can travel more than 100 miles as an airborne infection. Can humans catch the disease from animals? Yes, but very rarely and only thought to be by direct handling of sick animals. There were cases in the 1960s epidemic and children under 10 are most likely to suffer. In humans it is like flu but with an added sore mouth. People must be kept in quarantine until they have recovered. Would the meat of animals with foot and mouth be infected? Yes. This is the most likely way the infection came to Britain in the first case. Imports of meat from countries with foot and mouth are banned but infected meat fed to pigs in Northumberland in swill is regarded as the most likely cause of the outbreak, although the cause is still under investigation. Food containing the virus brought in from another country and carelessly thrown away in Britain is another possible cause. Countries must be disease-free for six months before exports are allowed. For infected meat to have reached Britain some illegal practice must have occurred. What would the effect on humans be from eating infected meat? None. Properly cooked meat kills the virus and it would not be in sufficient quantities to get past the human defence system. Animals are far more susceptible. What about wild animals? These are far less likely than farm animals to catch foot and mouth because they have less contact with infected animals. The rapid spread of infection so far has been caused by the mixing of sheep in markets and transporting them long distances crowded in lorries. If wild boar did get foot and mouth they would be the most likely wild animal to spread the disease because, like domestic pigs, they \"shed\" large quantities of virus . But experts think infection of wild animals is unlikely. Culling poses difficulties because frightened animals are likely to disperse, spreading the infection further than leaving them alone would do. What's going on?

      "bodyText": "Telewest has agreed a deal to take a significant stake in Sit-up, the digital television outfit run by Ashley Faull and John Egan, two of the founders of ONdigital. The cable company is injecting \u00a314.8m into Sit-up which launched a live auction TV channel, Bid-up.tv, last October. At the same time, Sit-up will pay \u00a310m for Screenshop, Telewest's home shopping channel to create a larger business focused on interactive TV. The transactions will leave Telewest with a 38% stake in the enlarged company. Mr Faull said Sit-up had enough financing in place to see Bid-up.tv and Screenshop through to profitability, but that further cash would be needed to meet the aim of launching more channels. \"We are in the fortunate position now of not needing further cash but we do have high ambitions for this company which are shared by Telewest,\" he said. \"It will be very useful to have a strategic shareholder.\" The company is considering a stock market flotation later this year. Mr Faull and Mr Egan together own around 30% of the business. Bid-up.tv has featured items ranging from a Renault Clio which sold for \u00a314,000 to the shirt worn by Anthony Hopkins in the Mask of Zorro. The company claims to be attracting 5,000 bids a day which are made through an automated system by using the keypad on a phone.",

The reason is simple: it's far better to spend millions on simple formula game shows than risk the uncertainty and wrath of highly paid TV moguls by commissioning a documentary that might fall down at the last moment. </p> <p>So it should have been refreshing to see that both BBC1 and BBC2 have invested cash in two new investigative programmes on the box, one of them aimed at prime-time viewers, and the other in the \"serious\" slot following Newsnight. But don't get too excited. One is effectively just a transplantation to the BBC of that old ITV tabloid warhorse, Roger Cook; the other is really insider reportage, with one man and a camcorder, rather than real investigative TV. </p> <p>Both, in different ways, follow a classic formula. How many times have I, for example, heard commissioning editors (to declare an interest, I am also a director of an obscure semi-professional outfit called Brown Envelope TV) say, \"we've got to have secret filming\" or \"think there's any chance of some violence?\" They want this kind of material regardless of the content or even the need to do it. They're also in love with MacIntyre Undercover-style TV - the reporter as the hard man exposing the truth with no regard for his safety or sometimes even his life. </p> <p>Paul Kenyon on BBC1 on Mondays gives you the lot. Barely have the credits rolled on tonight's programme on bogus doctors, for example, when the fists are flying, with the subject trying to jam shut a loo door to escape from our Paul and his camera team. Secret filming takes up a good half of the programme, and each disclosure is delivered with breathless intensity. Every classic line is there. The duped patients are \"disgusted\" and \"shocked\" when the reporter tells them they have been conned. The bogus medics get their comeuppance, the obligatory expert is there to say they have sinned, and even the reporter shows how he can pose as a bogus doctor complete with stethoscope and surgery skeleton and get away with it. By the end, as with a John Wayne movie, we can safely go to our beds, knowing that all the villains have had their just deserts and that our hero has fought his way through, against the odds, and emerged victorious. </p> <p>Sean Langan is an altogether different character. His late-night BBC2 series, Langan Behind The Lines, shown over five nights last week, explored the hidden and dangerous world of Muslim Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and the Gaza Strip. It was very personal TV - and the initial scene of him going across the Afghan border seemed too indulgent for words. But unlike Paul Kenyon, people can warm to Sean. His filming in Afghanistan - particularly the episode called Tea With The Taliban - provided amazing insights behind the Muslim veil. The fact that filming is banned in Afghanistan justified the approach. His open filming of the Taliban on the front line showed how the fighters actually love the cameras they outlaw. Many seemed surprised by how handsome they looked. </p> <p>His decision to film women illegally educating their daughters helped bring out the hidden side of the country. Langan's camera also brought home the horrors of the regime - for example, the atmosphere inside a football stadium where they kill transgressors of the faith. And his points hit home more often than not - such as his observation that, horrible as the deaths of the unbelievers were, they were hardly a million miles from the death penalties routinely meted out in George Bush's home state of Texas. </p> <p>Langan's film of life in the Gaza Strip brought home the crowded lifestyle of the Palestinians, trapped in permanent refugee camps, surrounded by the occasional spacious and green Israeli settlement. And he highlighted the fact that teenagers are the same anywhere - the rush to appear on film, \"to attract a foreign girl\", and antics on the beach. He also brought out a telling general ignorance that could only hearten Holocaust deniers - most young Palestinians thought the gassing of six million Jews was a Western myth put about by Zionists. \"Perhaps 1,000 died\", said one young Palestinian confidently. </p> <p>But none of the episodes could reasonably be called investigative journalism - even if they did challenge some of the myths about the Muslim world portrayed in the tabloids. Sadly, Langan's late-night series will not have been seen by a wide enough audience to change minds. (It must have been cheap - a hand-held camera, air fares and a number of inexpensive rooms in hotels, and BBC2 have a series all lined up.) But it was worthwhile, and something that could be developped. </p> <p>What on earth has happened to the real investigations? Even John Ware's recent semi-exposure of Railtrack on Panorama was a disappointment when compared to, for example, his monumental investigation into the \"home for votes\" scandal in Westminster a decade ago. It is certain that there are as many scandals that would make a big political impact lurking out there. But TV does not want to make the commitment and pay reporters for the many months it would take to amass sufficient evidence. We're left with fascinating but cheap reportage like Sean Langan's series, or the exposure of small to medium-size crooks in Harley Street, just as Roger Cook turned over the small-time villains a year ago. And when the Cook report did get its big chance - to expose the network behind former Tory minister Neil Hamilton and the \"cash for questions\" scandal involving lobbyist Ian Greer - they fluffed it. The programme was never finished or broadcast. Until TV does go for the \"big game\" again, we will have to be content with a rogues' gallery of small mammals exposed by the likes of Paul Kenyon. </p> <p>\u0095 Kenyon Confronts, 7.30pm, BBC1</p>",

Nine out of 12 euro members have used the mint to produce their new coins. </p> <p>The scale of the task is underlined by the fact that the euro coins being issued will in total weigh some 250,000 tonnes - enough to fill 15,000 fully loaded trucks. </p> <p>Strangely enough, the European Central Bank's official website preserves a discreet silence over the British involvement in the production of the euro coins. A helpful map illustrates where the euro notes were printed, but no details are available on the mint's involvement. </p> <p>While the coins and bank- notes will be ready, with less than 10 months until E-day, policymakers in Europe are becoming increasingly concerned the public will not. There will be a brief changeover period when both national currencies and euros will be legal tender, and thenfrancs, marks and all the other familiar notes and coins will disappear at the end of next February.

      "bodyText": "In south Wales, they are well prepared for the introduction of the euro. The Royal Mint's plant in Llantrisant has been spitting out 700 euro coins a minute for nearly a year, as part of the preparation for E-day - January 1 - when the first notes and coins of the new currency go into circulation. Britain may not be a member of the eurozone, but that did not stop the mint - the world's largest producer of copper blanks - winning the lion's share of the contract to produce the 50bn coins which must be ready by E-day. Nine out of 12 euro members have used the mint to produce their new coins. The scale of the task is underlined by the fact that the euro coins being issued will in total weigh some 250,000 tonnes - enough to fill 15,000 fully loaded trucks. Strangely enough, the European Central Bank's official website preserves a discreet silence over the British involvement in the production of the euro coins. A helpful map illustrates where the euro notes were printed, but no details are available on the mint's involvement. While the coins and bank- notes will be ready, with less than 10 months until E-day, policymakers in Europe are becoming increasingly concerned the public will not. There will be a brief changeover period when both national currencies and euros will be legal tender, and thenfrancs, marks and all the other familiar notes and coins will disappear at the end of next February. Several countries are aiming to effect the changeover even more quickly. Many small firms appear to be leaving it to the last minute to convert their systems to euros. The European Union's lat est survey showed that so far, only 15% of small businesses were prepared for the new currency. Half reported that they would not be ready until 2002. The European commission fears a surge in demand for accountants and IT specialists to help the changeover could cause bottlenecks, making some firms miss the deadline. The prospect of paychecks failing to make it into bank accounts is not a happy one, on top of the disruption the new currency is already likely to cause.

      "body": "<p>Tate Britain has recreated JMW Turner's own picture gallery to mark the 150th anniversary of the artist's death. However, the features that horrified 19th-century visitors - leaking roof, sinister housekeeper swathed in bandages and stalked by dozens of Manx cats, paintings blocking a broken window or used as a cat flap - have been omitted.</p> <p>The Tate usually displays a mixture of the 300 oil paintings and 20,000 watercolours and drawings, including unfinished works from his studio, which it received as part of the Turner bequest. The anniversary exhibition, opening today, collects together only the pictures, many imposing but rather conventional history paintings, which Turner himself chose to keep and display as a testimonial to his own powers as an artist.</p> <p>The walls have been repainted a dark red, to suggest the colour Turner chose for his own walls.</p> <p>\"We know from a visitor's account that the gallery had red walls, but he rather unhelpfully described it as 'Indian red, neither pale nor dark',\" curator David Blayney Brown said. \"The paintings are transformed by being hung on it - you can almost hear the pictures sighing with relief.\" The paintings that can be identified from two tiny, murky contemporary views, done from memory by George Jones, including a view of Richmond and the Battle of Trafalgar, have been hung at the Tate in the positions shown.</p> <p>\"It seemed an interesting way of looking at the collection to display only those works which Turner himself valued most highly, and consciously saw as his own lasting memorial,\" said Dr Blayney Brown.</p> <p>Turner, a barber's son, built on a gallery when he acquired his London house in the early 19th century. He bought back some earlier canvases and refused to sell others - including one believed to show his two illegitimate daughters - to add to the collection.</p> <p>The gallery became his mausoleum in 1851, when his coffin was laid out among the pictures before his burial at St Paul's. The grimly severe facade of the house, designed by Turner himself, was recorded in a Victorian photograph before its demolition. In the last decades of his life many were shocked by their visit.

      "bodyText": "Tate Britain has recreated JMW Turner's own picture gallery to mark the 150th anniversary of the artist's death. However, the features that horrified 19th-century visitors - leaking roof, sinister housekeeper swathed in bandages and stalked by dozens of Manx cats, paintings blocking a broken window or used as a cat flap - have been omitted. The Tate usually displays a mixture of the 300 oil paintings and 20,000 watercolours and drawings, including unfinished works from his studio, which it received as part of the Turner bequest. The anniversary exhibition, opening today, collects together only the pictures, many imposing but rather conventional history paintings, which Turner himself chose to keep and display as a testimonial to his own powers as an artist. The walls have been repainted a dark red, to suggest the colour Turner chose for his own walls. \"We know from a visitor's account that the gallery had red walls, but he rather unhelpfully described it as 'Indian red, neither pale nor dark',\" curator David Blayney Brown said. \"The paintings are transformed by being hung on it - you can almost hear the pictures sighing with relief.\" The paintings that can be identified from two tiny, murky contemporary views, done from memory by George Jones, including a view of Richmond and the Battle of Trafalgar, have been hung at the Tate in the positions shown. \"It seemed an interesting way of looking at the collection to display only those works which Turner himself valued most highly, and consciously saw as his own lasting memorial,\" said Dr Blayney Brown. Turner, a barber's son, built on a gallery when he acquired his London house in the early 19th century. He bought back some earlier canvases and refused to sell others - including one believed to show his two illegitimate daughters - to add to the collection. The gallery became his mausoleum in 1851, when his coffin was laid out among the pictures before his burial at St Paul's. The grimly severe facade of the house, designed by Turner himself, was recorded in a Victorian photograph before its demolition. In the last decades of his life many were shocked by their visit. By then the reclusive Turner had a tiny cottage on Chelsea Embankment, and lived there as \"Captain Booth\", rarely visiting his house and gallery. Visitors to Harley Street would have made an appointment, knocked on the door and been reluctantly admitted by the alarming figure of the housekeeper, who had a skin disease which meant her entire head was bandaged apart from her eyes. She also collected Manx cats, and up to 30 are believed to have had the run of the house. The exhibition also has objects from the house and library, including a sheet of drawings for a lecture on perspectives, covered in little black paw prints. Turner permitted his housekeeper to block a broken window with an Italian landscape watercolour - a star exhibit at the recent Academy exhibition of his major watercolours - and to use an early canvas of the Thames foreshore as a cat flap. His will left the 300 canvases from his gallery to the National Gallery, provided that a special gallery was built for them, and most of his \u00a3140,000 fortune to create a hospice for decayed artists. The will was overturned in the high court, with the result that distant relatives got most of the money and the nation got not just his chosen paintings but everything in his studio, including thousands of watercolours, sketches and working drawings. The Turner bequest - which was transferred to the new Tate Gallery early in the 20th century - has been condemned by some art historians as a betrayal of the artist's intentions. Dr Blayney Brown said: \"Say what you like about the Tate, we have never used a Turner as a cat flap.\"",

The letters themselves have become a word in their own right, defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as \"a type of mechanical excavator with a shovel at the front and a digging arm at the rear\". The vivid colour that they always display has become a standard paint, known as \"JCB yellow\".</p> <p>From modest beginnings at the end of the second world war, Bamford began developing agricultural trailers.

The letters themselves have become a word in their own right, defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as \"a type of mechanical excavator with a shovel at the front and a digging arm at the rear\". The vivid colour that they always display has become a standard paint, known as \"JCB yellow\". From modest beginnings at the end of the second world war, Bamford began developing agricultural trailers. At his death, JCB was the largest privately-owned engineering company in Britain, employing 4,500 people and manufacturing 30,000 machines a year in 12 factories on three continents.

At the age of 16, she began work as a secretary and switchboard operator. In her early 20s, she married Lascelves Mundle and had two children, Rascelles and Acqua, though the marriage broke up shortly afterwards.

By the mid-90s, rather than continue to drag each other down, Junior left.

His family mounted a campaign to press for justice, and Arlene threw herself into this activity with a passion and fury. This was her first encounter with the community police consultative group in Lambeth, which was to become the platform from which she launched her public career.</p> <p>Arlene's temper was legendary, and, at first, her anger at the racism and injustice she perceived as endemic in police relations with black people boiled at an almost uncontrollable pitch. But she harnessed that energy, in particular working with Lee Jasper's 1990 Trust, motivating others and engaging her organisational skills to huge effect. She met Stephen Lawrence's parents and, through various campaigns, started to understand more about police work.</p> <p>Arlene saw how black victims of crime were being poorly served by the police, but, more controversially, believed change would only come if the black community engaged with the authorities to push for it. No one pushed harder than she did.</p> <p>Her direct approach and unorthox methods - telephone calls in the early hours, even to senior officers, were her trademark - came as a culture shock to the Metropolitan police. But at a time when the police needed to listen, she had plenty to say, so she was employed to provide a much-needed community perspective for senior officers on training exercises, and to advise an operation tackling drug-related gun crime, codenamed Trident.</p> <p>At times, Arlene jeopardised her own safety, but she was never afraid to speak out against the villains on her doorstep, and took the lead in promoting a highly successful firarms amnesty in Lambeth.

I don't know whether I was the target or somebody else but, as far as I know, there were no other important people on the flight.\" Mr Shinawatra refused to speculate about who might have been responsible for the blast, but one of his security advisers, Police General Prasarn Wongwai, said the billionaire telecoms tycoon had his suspicions. \"I have already talked to the prime minister and he seems to have a clue who did it. But he wouldn't want to talk too much because it might pressure the investigation officials.\" Thailand's air investigation agency, which is leading the investigation, has yet to comment officially on what caused the explosion. But, as the engines were not switched on at the time of the explosion, a mechanical malfunction is expected to be ruled out. Thailand is no stranger to coup attempts, but no prime minister in this constitutional monarchy has faced an assassination attempt. Last night Mr Shinawatra suggested that someone close to him must have been involved in the explosion; he had originally planned to go to Chiang Mai yesterday but told his secretary on Friday to change the flight to Saturday afternoon. \"If I was a target of the explosion, the one who placed the bomb should have had access to my schedule,\" he said. Local media are speculating that the most likely perpetrator is someone with links to the extremely lucrative drugs trade in the Golden Triangle, the region where Thailand, Burma and Laos meet. Mr Shinawatra made repeated promises during the election campaign to crack down hard on drug traffickers, particularly drug lords in Burma moving their wares through Thailand. He reiterated that promise yesterday, vowing to eradicate the \"rampant\" drugs trade that is blighting the region. The manifest showed that 149 passengers, including the prime minister and his son, were booked to be on flight TG114 to Chiang Mai. Mr Shinawatra's Thai Rak Thai (Thai Love Thai) party swept to power largely on the back of the leader's personal popularity, bolstered by campaign promises of tens of thousands of pounds for every village, and tax cuts. Despite his party's landslide victory the prime minister might be out of office in a couple of months if a corruption indictment against him is upheld by the constitutional court. He is accused of hiding assets while serving in a previous administration. His defence could include the fact thatthat Thais knew of the scandal well before polling day but still voted for him in record numbers.",

As chairman of the eastern region of the UKIP, and a prospective candidate at the next election, I believe that the days of Euroscepticism are long over. You either support the EU or you are against it. The Tory party supports the EU, therefore any candidate who wants to be elected for that party is by definition a supporter of the EU.</p> <p>The allegiance to the EU, and to Britain eventually joining the Emu, is virtually the same in the Tory, Labour and Lib Dem parties, yet the Tory party continues to promote the deception with slogans like \"In Europe, not run by Europe\". It is also cynically promoting itself as the party that will save the pound, when it has no such intention.</p> <p>William Hague claims that, if elected, his party will successfully negotiate major changes to the operation of the EU. He may well obtain some concessions, but he is deluding himself, and the country, if he thinks he can change the essence of the EU without the overwhelming support of other countries. He would need to get this support before the next general election, and this is not very likely.</p> <p>I cannot imagine the leaders of UKIP doing a deal with the Tories, even though we are sorely in need of funds. However, if they do take the money, that will be the end of UKIP. <br><b>Brian Lee</b> <br>Hadleigh, Essex <br>brianlee@ukipsouthend.freeserve.co.uk</p> <p>\u0095 Your leader (March 2), displays a disturbing lack of knowledge of electioneering. Will you allow a Tory to trespass on your pages? Campaigning from a safe distance by phone and email may well suit Labour canvassers, who are as welcome in the countryside as the foot and mouth virus. The Conservative campaign, however, is based almost entirely on door-to-door canvassing, which had already started in some areas. Posters are to be displayed alongside main roads and people without transport conveyed to the polling stations. Livestock markets and country fairs (currently suspended) provide candidates with opportunities to meet the electorate; and a programme of public question and answer sessions in village halls was scheduled.</p> <p>It would obviously be to Labour's advantage to hold elections while their opponents' campaigns are effectively banned.

      "bodyText": "You suggest that the UK Independence party is doing a deal with the Tories not to stand in certain constituencies ('\u00a32m deal' to shield Tory marginals, March 3). As chairman of the eastern region of the UKIP, and a prospective candidate at the next election, I believe that the days of Euroscepticism are long over. You either support the EU or you are against it. The Tory party supports the EU, therefore any candidate who wants to be elected for that party is by definition a supporter of the EU. The allegiance to the EU, and to Britain eventually joining the Emu, is virtually the same in the Tory, Labour and Lib Dem parties, yet the Tory party continues to promote the deception with slogans like \"In Europe, not run by Europe\". It is also cynically promoting itself as the party that will save the pound, when it has no such intention. William Hague claims that, if elected, his party will successfully negotiate major changes to the operation of the EU. He may well obtain some concessions, but he is deluding himself, and the country, if he thinks he can change the essence of the EU without the overwhelming support of other countries. He would need to get this support before the next general election, and this is not very likely. I cannot imagine the leaders of UKIP doing a deal with the Tories, even though we are sorely in need of funds. However, if they do take the money, that will be the end of UKIP. Brian Lee Hadleigh, Essex brianlee@ukipsouthend.freeserve.co.uk \u0095 Your leader (March 2), displays a disturbing lack of knowledge of electioneering. Will you allow a Tory to trespass on your pages? Campaigning from a safe distance by phone and email may well suit Labour canvassers, who are as welcome in the countryside as the foot and mouth virus. The Conservative campaign, however, is based almost entirely on door-to-door canvassing, which had already started in some areas. Posters are to be displayed alongside main roads and people without transport conveyed to the polling stations. Livestock markets and country fairs (currently suspended) provide candidates with opportunities to meet the electorate; and a programme of public question and answer sessions in village halls was scheduled. It would obviously be to Labour's advantage to hold elections while their opponents' campaigns are effectively banned. Faced with the near certainty of rejection in country seats, the foot and mouth crisis must have seemed to be heavensent and it comes as no surprise that they should exploit it to the full.

      "body": "<p>I am pleased Polly Toynbee went to Socialist Alliance's press conference and yet she seems to have missed the point (Coalition of dreamers, March 2). The Socialist Alliance is not a coalition of Militant and the Socialist Workers party. Many of us in the SA would never join either of these organisations.</p> <p>The Socialist Alliance is not there to poke and prod Mr Blair to throw a few more scraps to the poor. Rather, it is that Labour has ceased to represent working people. Labour has been transformed from a party which demanded concessions from business to a party that directly represents business. If it offers a few concessions to some poorer voters, this is not because the poor are part of the project, but because they are needed for Blair to win office. This is no different from the other parties offering something to the poor.</p> <p>Yes socialists dream. And so they should - to hell with the stuffy accountants asking of every policy, \"will our friends in business be happy with this\"? The Socialist Alliance will get a lot of policies wrong, it will be vague and muddled (just like the other parties). However, for the first time for a long while, ordinary people will have a party in which they are members and the subjects of policy, not objects to be treated with Alastair Campbell's contempt. <br><b>Geoff Barr</b> <br>Exeter</p> <p>\u0095 It is precisely the jaded cynicism displayed by Polly Toynbee that is turning people, especially young voters, off politics. If we cannot aim for a better society - yes, to dream of a new sort of world - then our political views descend into those of the \"old troupers\" abandoning the \"romance\" of fighting for a just society. Politics becomes the vehicle of cynical manipulation, not of hope, justice and freedom. Would Polly Toynbee condemn Martin Luther King for having a dream? <br><b>Marcus Larsen</b> <br>Chair, London Socialist Alliance <br>marcus.larsen@lineone.net</p> <p>\u0095 Polly Toynbee fails to acknowledge both the number of supporters who have spent decades within the Labour party - John Mulrenan, standing against Harriet Harman, was her election agent in the 1982 election which first brought her into parliament - and those who, like myself, have never previously been members of any political party. Labour's self-reinvention as a \"pro-business\" party has created a vacuum on the left, and someone's got to fill it. What have the Romans done for us? Not nearly as much as they've done for the Romans. <br><b>Charles Shaar Murray</b> <br>London <br>csm@angels.demon.co.uk</p> <p>\u0095 Of course the left can be quixotic and frustrating.

      "bodyText": "I am pleased Polly Toynbee went to Socialist Alliance's press conference and yet she seems to have missed the point (Coalition of dreamers, March 2). The Socialist Alliance is not a coalition of Militant and the Socialist Workers party. Many of us in the SA would never join either of these organisations. The Socialist Alliance is not there to poke and prod Mr Blair to throw a few more scraps to the poor. Rather, it is that Labour has ceased to represent working people. Labour has been transformed from a party which demanded concessions from business to a party that directly represents business. If it offers a few concessions to some poorer voters, this is not because the poor are part of the project, but because they are needed for Blair to win office. This is no different from the other parties offering something to the poor. Yes socialists dream. And so they should - to hell with the stuffy accountants asking of every policy, \"will our friends in business be happy with this\"? The Socialist Alliance will get a lot of policies wrong, it will be vague and muddled (just like the other parties). However, for the first time for a long while, ordinary people will have a party in which they are members and the subjects of policy, not objects to be treated with Alastair Campbell's contempt. Geoff Barr Exeter \u0095 It is precisely the jaded cynicism displayed by Polly Toynbee that is turning people, especially young voters, off politics. If we cannot aim for a better society - yes, to dream of a new sort of world - then our political views descend into those of the \"old troupers\" abandoning the \"romance\" of fighting for a just society. Politics becomes the vehicle of cynical manipulation, not of hope, justice and freedom. Would Polly Toynbee condemn Martin Luther King for having a dream? Marcus Larsen Chair, London Socialist Alliance marcus.larsen@lineone.net \u0095 Polly Toynbee fails to acknowledge both the number of supporters who have spent decades within the Labour party - John Mulrenan, standing against Harriet Harman, was her election agent in the 1982 election which first brought her into parliament - and those who, like myself, have never previously been members of any political party. Labour's self-reinvention as a \"pro-business\" party has created a vacuum on the left, and someone's got to fill it. What have the Romans done for us? Not nearly as much as they've done for the Romans. Charles Shaar Murray London csm@angels.demon.co.uk \u0095 Of course the left can be quixotic and frustrating. But at least it sees Blairite New Labour for the entryism it is. An evangelical, middle-class concern for the deserving poor, it has no philosophical basis in socialism and seemingly less and less with liberal democracy. It's still a damn sight better than Toryism, but Polly is going to be disappointed. Chris Walker Woking, Surrey \u0095 I am fortunate in that I chose to move to south Wales 23 years ago. My wife and I are now active members of a genuinely modern, socialist party: Plaid Cymru. In its manifesto the party says what Labour should be saying. I only hope that socialists in the regions of England can take a lesson from us and establish not separatist, but potentially British federalist political organisations. Philip D Whitehead Neath, Glamorgan. \u0095 Whingeing lawyers, whining academics and pretend politicians write to the Guardian on matters of little import, while ordinary people tell opinion pollsters (including me) that life is now much better and most of them will vote Labour.

      "byline": "Chris McGreal in Pretoria",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The South African government confronts the world's major drug manufacturers in court today to argue that it has the right to put the lives of the poor ahead of multinationals' profits.</p> <p>The outcome of the lawsuit could have major implications for access to cheaper medicines to fight Aids and other devastating diseases across the developing world. The court's ruling will also have a significant impact on health care in South Africa, where nearly half of all health spending goes to pay for drugs, compared with less than 15% in the NHS in Britain.</p> <p>Nearly 40 pharmaceutical companies, including GlaxoSmithKline, want the Pretoria high court to strike down a law which permits the government to buy patented drugs from suppliers other than the manufacturer, or generics from factories in India or Brazil, when patented medicines are \"unaffordable\" or there is a \"health emergency\" such as Aids. The legislation also bans the practice of paying incentives to doctors to prescribe expensive brand name medicines.</p> <p>The drug firms say they are not trying to justify unethical and protectionist practices but to defend their patents and to strike down a law they say is unconstitutional in part because it lacks clarity on issues such as what is \"unaffordable\".</p> <p>But the director general of South Africa's health ministry, Ayanda Ntsaluba, accuses pharmaceutical firms of opposing ethical laws that are standard practice in western countries.</p> <p>\"This case is about how we get affordable drugs to the majority of people in South Africa. There are drugs that we pay more for here than they do in Europe,\" he said. \"It's also about how you prescribe and distribute those drugs. There are some very dubious practices and we want to put a stop to them. The drug companies oppose us and we've told them that the things they don't want us to stop in our own society would never be permitted in their own.\"</p> <p>The drug industry is asking the Pretoria high court to declare the Medicines and Related Substances Control Amendment Act illegal on an array of grounds.</p> <p>The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association (PMA), representing 39 big drug companies, won a court injunction blocking the law's implementation three years ago by claiming that it breached international trade agreements, specifically the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (Trips), by effectively scrapping recognition of patents on medicines.</p> <p>The Clinton administration backed the drug companies and put South Africa on a \"watch list\" of nations declared patent pirates. But over time, the South African government made a persuasive case that the law is permitted under Trips.</p> <p>After demonstrations during former vice-president Al Gore's presidential election campaign, South Africa was dropped from the watch list. The Bush administration has gone further and said it does not oppose the new legislation. Similarly, the EU initially condemned the law as illegal but has since changed its mind.</p> <p>The drug firms apparently saw the writing on the wall and shifted tactics. The PMA now plays down the patent issue and claims the law contravenes South Africa's constitution.</p> <p>\"This law is arbitrary and gives the health minister too many powers,\" the head of the PMA, Mirryena Deeb, said. \"There is lack of due process. The minister can make a decision that a drug is too expensive and the drug companies have no right to defend themselves. We want to know what is meant by unaffordable when the government won't tell us what they can afford.\"</p> <p>The pharmaceutical firms will also ar gue that the government cannot know whether anti-Aids drugs are affordable because it has never asked the price. The PMA says the government is working on the false assumption that it would have to pay the full market price, whereas many African countries receive drugs at a large discount. The firms want the government to be forced to tender.</p> <p>\"The state cannot know what it costs to treat HIV-positive people because it has never asked us,\" Ms Deeb said. \"Three years ago GlaxoWellcome [which merged with SmithKline Beecham last year to form GlaxoSmithKline] approached them and offered a world best price. The government said it was too expensive. Glaxo said tell us what you can afford. The government never came back.\"</p> <p>But Dr Ntsaluba argues that, even with the discounts offered to other governments, his own could not afford to buy many brand-name drugs, particularly those used for treating HIV.</p> <p>\"It doesn't help for them to say we will reduce the cost by 60% because it's still unaffordable for developing countries. The tender issue is a very strange argument. We have done a study that says that even if you reduce the cost of triple therapy [in treating HIV] by 80% the public sector could not afford it,\" he said.</p> <p>The reality is that South Africa cannot afford to treat everyone. The expense of delivering drugs to rural areas, and providing the necessary medical backup, can far outweigh the cost of the treatments themselves. But the cheaper the drugs, the more people will benefit.</p> <p>The dispute has been complicated by President Thabo Mbeki's questioning of the connection between HIV and Aids, and his government's initial refusal to distribute anti-retroviral drugs. The health ministry for a long time refused even to certify some key medicines used to treat HIV, saying they were too toxic.</p> <p>\"The government first raised issues of cost,\" Ms Deeb said. \"Then it was an issue of toxicity, saying we were trying to stuff toxic drugs down African throats. Then there was the whole debate by our president about whether the disease existed. Why would government need good prices on drugs that it apparently didn't want?</p> <p>\"We are going to the party to try and alleviate great suffering around the world. What has this government done that betters what we have done? Where does the government's responsibility begin and end in dealing with this virus? They have woken up too late to this illness and they feel drowned by it and they are trying to blame us.\"</p> <p>After considerable condemnation, Mr Mbeki quietly revised his policy.</p> <p><b> Far-reaching effects</b><br></p> <p>If the legislation comes into force, it will have a big impact on the treatment of South Africa's 4m people with HIV - about 10% of the population - and other major diseases.</p> <p>\"HIV and Aids are very symbolic in pushing home this case,\" Dr Ntsaluba said. \"But I think we have to be careful not to restrict the issue to HIV/Aids. Look at how many die of malaria. And even with HIV we need to deal with opportunistic infections like TB. TB is a defining disease and very widespread. The costs of the multinationals' drugs to treat it are out of our reach.\"</p> <p>The new law has another intent that the drug companies want the court to strike down. It aims to break the practice of doctors and chemists personally profiting from dispensing branded drugs over generic ones. In South Africa, doctors may run their own pharmacies and make money on their prescriptions. The new law bans that, and requires doctors and chemists to tell patients about cheaper generic drugs. It also bars inducements to dispense a particular drug.</p> <p>The PMA argues that these measures are an interference with free trade.</p> <p>The government believes that if it loses the case it will only be over the wording of the legislation and that its right to pass such laws will be upheld.

      "bodyText": "The South African government confronts the world's major drug manufacturers in court today to argue that it has the right to put the lives of the poor ahead of multinationals' profits. The outcome of the lawsuit could have major implications for access to cheaper medicines to fight Aids and other devastating diseases across the developing world. The court's ruling will also have a significant impact on health care in South Africa, where nearly half of all health spending goes to pay for drugs, compared with less than 15% in the NHS in Britain. Nearly 40 pharmaceutical companies, including GlaxoSmithKline, want the Pretoria high court to strike down a law which permits the government to buy patented drugs from suppliers other than the manufacturer, or generics from factories in India or Brazil, when patented medicines are \"unaffordable\" or there is a \"health emergency\" such as Aids. The legislation also bans the practice of paying incentives to doctors to prescribe expensive brand name medicines. The drug firms say they are not trying to justify unethical and protectionist practices but to defend their patents and to strike down a law they say is unconstitutional in part because it lacks clarity on issues such as what is \"unaffordable\". But the director general of South Africa's health ministry, Ayanda Ntsaluba, accuses pharmaceutical firms of opposing ethical laws that are standard practice in western countries. \"This case is about how we get affordable drugs to the majority of people in South Africa. There are drugs that we pay more for here than they do in Europe,\" he said. \"It's also about how you prescribe and distribute those drugs. There are some very dubious practices and we want to put a stop to them. The drug companies oppose us and we've told them that the things they don't want us to stop in our own society would never be permitted in their own.\" The drug industry is asking the Pretoria high court to declare the Medicines and Related Substances Control Amendment Act illegal on an array of grounds. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association (PMA), representing 39 big drug companies, won a court injunction blocking the law's implementation three years ago by claiming that it breached international trade agreements, specifically the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (Trips), by effectively scrapping recognition of patents on medicines. The Clinton administration backed the drug companies and put South Africa on a \"watch list\" of nations declared patent pirates. But over time, the South African government made a persuasive case that the law is permitted under Trips. After demonstrations during former vice-president Al Gore's presidential election campaign, South Africa was dropped from the watch list. The Bush administration has gone further and said it does not oppose the new legislation. Similarly, the EU initially condemned the law as illegal but has since changed its mind. The drug firms apparently saw the writing on the wall and shifted tactics. The PMA now plays down the patent issue and claims the law contravenes South Africa's constitution. \"This law is arbitrary and gives the health minister too many powers,\" the head of the PMA, Mirryena Deeb, said. \"There is lack of due process. The minister can make a decision that a drug is too expensive and the drug companies have no right to defend themselves. We want to know what is meant by unaffordable when the government won't tell us what they can afford.\" The pharmaceutical firms will also ar gue that the government cannot know whether anti-Aids drugs are affordable because it has never asked the price. The PMA says the government is working on the false assumption that it would have to pay the full market price, whereas many African countries receive drugs at a large discount. The firms want the government to be forced to tender. \"The state cannot know what it costs to treat HIV-positive people because it has never asked us,\" Ms Deeb said. \"Three years ago GlaxoWellcome [which merged with SmithKline Beecham last year to form GlaxoSmithKline] approached them and offered a world best price. The government said it was too expensive. Glaxo said tell us what you can afford. The government never came back.\" But Dr Ntsaluba argues that, even with the discounts offered to other governments, his own could not afford to buy many brand-name drugs, particularly those used for treating HIV. \"It doesn't help for them to say we will reduce the cost by 60% because it's still unaffordable for developing countries. The tender issue is a very strange argument. We have done a study that says that even if you reduce the cost of triple therapy [in treating HIV] by 80% the public sector could not afford it,\" he said. The reality is that South Africa cannot afford to treat everyone. The expense of delivering drugs to rural areas, and providing the necessary medical backup, can far outweigh the cost of the treatments themselves. But the cheaper the drugs, the more people will benefit. The dispute has been complicated by President Thabo Mbeki's questioning of the connection between HIV and Aids, and his government's initial refusal to distribute anti-retroviral drugs. The health ministry for a long time refused even to certify some key medicines used to treat HIV, saying they were too toxic. \"The government first raised issues of cost,\" Ms Deeb said. \"Then it was an issue of toxicity, saying we were trying to stuff toxic drugs down African throats. Then there was the whole debate by our president about whether the disease existed. Why would government need good prices on drugs that it apparently didn't want? \"We are going to the party to try and alleviate great suffering around the world. What has this government done that betters what we have done? Where does the government's responsibility begin and end in dealing with this virus? They have woken up too late to this illness and they feel drowned by it and they are trying to blame us.\" After considerable condemnation, Mr Mbeki quietly revised his policy. Far-reaching effects If the legislation comes into force, it will have a big impact on the treatment of South Africa's 4m people with HIV - about 10% of the population - and other major diseases. \"HIV and Aids are very symbolic in pushing home this case,\" Dr Ntsaluba said. \"But I think we have to be careful not to restrict the issue to HIV/Aids. Look at how many die of malaria. And even with HIV we need to deal with opportunistic infections like TB. TB is a defining disease and very widespread. The costs of the multinationals' drugs to treat it are out of our reach.\" The new law has another intent that the drug companies want the court to strike down. It aims to break the practice of doctors and chemists personally profiting from dispensing branded drugs over generic ones. In South Africa, doctors may run their own pharmacies and make money on their prescriptions. The new law bans that, and requires doctors and chemists to tell patients about cheaper generic drugs. It also bars inducements to dispense a particular drug. The PMA argues that these measures are an interference with free trade. The government believes that if it loses the case it will only be over the wording of the legislation and that its right to pass such laws will be upheld. Some of the drug companies now privately agree that that is the best they can hope for. \"The drug companies want to meet us now,\" Dr Ntsaluba said. \"There was a time when we could deal with this outside the court but my experience is we just go in circles with them. Now is the time to get it clarified and get started with getting the drugs. We can't afford to keep delaying.\" Protests:Global day of action Mounting outrage among healthcare workers in the developing world, such as from members of M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, aid agencies and Aids activists, and a powerful grass-roots campaign in South Africa has made the trial in Pretoria's high court today symbolic of an injustice: Millions, they say, are dying in the developing world of diseases that are curable or treatable in the west. Phil Bloomer, head of advocacy at Oxfam, gave an indication of the mood in Pretoria. \"We're looking at one of the most stark acts of corporate inhumanity,\" he said. \"At the end of the seven days of this trial, 5,000 poor South Africans will be dead who were alive at the beginning of it. In the same time, the top five drugs companies will have sold $1.3bn [\u00a3884m] worth of medicines.\" Despite evidence that the drugs companies want to mend their collective image, it appears too late for them to salvage much credibility. An international day of action has been called today by activists and campaigning organisations. \u0095 South Africa In Pretoria, a demonstration outside the high court.

      "body": "<p>The Kirov and the Bolshoi, Russia's two monumental lyric theatres, have been run by some remarkable characters over the years. Tiny, ferocious Yuri Grigorovich maintained an iron grip on the Bolshoi's ballet company between 1964 and 1995 (his dancers called him the Tsar). Valery Gergiev, who has been in overall charge of the Kirov theatre since 1995, is a Byronic monster with a mind like a steel trap. And Vladimir Vasiliev, his opposite number at the Bolshoi between 1995 and 2000, is still revered as one of the dancing gods of his generation. But Boris Akimov, who became artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet last October, seems to have been cast in a humbler mould. </p> <p>Akimov, 54, was in Britain recently to fulfil a coaching commitment with the Royal Ballet. A pale, thin man with mild blue eyes, a big forehead and straggling grey locks, he speaks little English but smiles a lot as his interpreter fills in the gaps. You wait for some power-trippy ego to emerge, some calculating front, some blade of ambition, but there is none. Akimov speaks with ingenuous enthusiasm about his commitment to unifying the company and his determination \"not to put any dirtiness on any person\". And this makes me tremble for his future. For the job he has taken on has always involved so much rancour and intrigue, it makes running the Royal Opera House seem like a picnic. </p> <p>Akimov admits that he had a few days of \"hard thinking\" to do before accepting the post. But he had trained at the Bolshoi school, danced in the company and coached its dancers, so the offer was \"a huge honour, a very historical moment in my life\". He claims to have put the Bolshoi's \"traumatic\" past behind him. \"It's impossible to continue to think about the old problems. Now I have to think about what is necessary for the future.\" </p> <p>But where does he begin? Akimov lists his goals: maintaining the classical repertory, raising performing standards and finding new choreography. Any head of a world-class company would say the same. What makes Akimov an interesting director for the Bolshoi is that he sees his job in an international context. </p> <p>Over the past 12 years Akimov has had an unusually wide experience of foreign companies for a Russian ballet master. When the Royal Ballet was performing in Moscow in 1988, its director at the time, Anthony Dowell, watched Akimov take a class and was so taken with his teaching that he invited him back to London as a guest coach. This turned into an annual visit - Akimov speaks happily of the \"rare sympathy\" between himself and British dancers - and prompted invitations from other countries. </p> <p>This broader perspective includes a list of western choreography he is interested in acquiring, including that of Frederick Ashton, Kenneth MacMillan and Jiri Kylian. But it also includes a realistic view of what's involved in creating a new repertory. \"We need to find new productions that will give a new face to the Bolshoi, and we have to think very hard where to find this new choreography. There is a crisis of choreographers all over the world. The last century was very rich - each company had two or three outstanding choreographers who determined the route their companies would take. It is harder now.\" </p> <p>He has seen western classical companies reinvigorate their repertory with work from modern dance choreographers, but admits this will be harder for the Bolshoi, given the fledgling state of the Russian modern dance scene. However, he says, the Bolshoi has many talented young soloists who would like to experiment with modern dance, and he sees advantages in the fact that the company will shortly have to move into a smaller theatre while the main stage is rebuilt. \"We won't be able to present any of our big productions in this new theatre, and we will have to experiment with 'chamber' ballets.\" </p> <p>The blockbuster spectacles for which the Bolshoi is famous (including Jacobson and Khachaturian's Spartacus of 1956, and the 19th century classics) will continue to be shown on tour, though. For a company whose dancers can earn as much in a day abroad as they do in a month at home, performing outside Russia is crucial. But Akimov is also eager to show his dancers to the world and to regain ground from the Kirov. Asked why the Bolshoi's season in London next month features only divertissements and classical extracts, Akimov, uncharacteristically, becomes almost haughty. \"The Kirov often do these gala programmes,\" he sniffs. \"And when we don't do them, the press always ask us why not.\" </p> <p>But do any animosities linger within the company? Akimov points out that Grigorovich has returned to revive his production of Swan Lake. \"Time heals,\" he laughs. \"And a lot of time has passed since 1995.\" He says his commitment to teaching will help bind the company together, too. \"I love a kind, collaborative atmosphere. That is why I will continue to coach. I will lead my life in the rehearsal studio, where I can be close to everyone. I get very quickly tired of conflict. My life is in the theatre. Everyone there knows me. Anyone who is cleaning the corridors knows me.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Bolshoi Ballet will be performing at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London WC2 (020-7494 5399), from April 25 to May 1.</p>",

She used to be conspicuous, as she clacked along the pavements in her white plastic stilettos, her bare legs mottled patriotic red, white and blue with cold, and her big bottom barely covered by her denim miniskirt. Essex girls usually come in twos, both behind pushchairs with large infants in them. Sometimes you hear them before you see them, cackling shrilly or yelling to each other from one end of the street to the other, or berating those infants in blood-curdling fashion. Occasionally they are accompanied by the hangdog sire of their child, more often by a mother, who is simply a 16 or 17 years older version of themselves. All parties bar the infants will have a cigarette going.</p> <p>The Essex girl is tough, loud, vulgar and unashamed. Her hair is badly dyed not because she can't afford a hairdresser, but because she wants it to look brassy. Nobody makes her wear her ankle chain; she likes the message it sends. Nobody laughs harder at an Essex girl joke than she does: she is not ashamed to admit what she puts behind her ears to make her more attractive is her ankles. She is anarchy on stilts; when she and her mates descend upon Southend for a rave, even the bouncers grow pale.</p> <p>Her existence and her style make nonsense of the Labour rhetoric about \"social exclusion\". She does not see herself as outside society; she sees herself as belonging to the real world of family loyalty, sexual unpredictability, underemployment and petty crime, and the Blairs as pious, condescending and self-deluding. I think she's great.</p> <p>The Essex girl neither knows nor cares that she is the target of the nastiest kind of misogyny. If nerdy men revenge themselves by emailing truly disgusting jokes to Essex girls websites, it's pretty much their problem. It was a great old Essex girl who told GMTV that she \"hoped\" it was Lisa who shot Phil Mitchell, against hope, alas. Lisa is too whiney and self-pitying to qualify as an Essex girl (or to shoot Phil Mitchell). EastEnders has to take part of the blame for Essex girls going underground because Mel, who is a genuine Essex girl, buys her clothes at Miss Selfridge and looks more like a young executive than a barmaid. Essex girls have no ambition to be pseudo-high-class gangster totty. Any Essex girl with a bosom as unimpressive as Mel's would wear a padded bra.</p> <p>There are few Essex girls in the historic record, partly because Essex has fewer great houses per square mile than any other county in England, and historians are by and large only aware of the inmates of great houses. Historic precedents for the 21st-century phenomenon of the Essex girl can be found in ballad literature, workhouse records and crime pamphlets, which abound with foul-mouthed molls and bludgets. Essex was always noted for its ducking stools and scolds' bridles, and for \"witches\", which is just another name for uncontrollable women.</p> <p>Lady Mary Wroth, who lived at Loughton from 1604 to 1617 or so, was pretty wild, for an aristocrat, because she kept her lawful husband on short rations till he died, then got off with her married cousin, whom she had fancied all her life, had two children by him, and compounded her offence by publishing both the poems she wrote during the affair and a roman \u00e0 clef about the knobs she had known at the court of James II.</p> <p>Wroth was an Essex girl only by marriage. Mad Madge Cavendish, who was born Margaret Lucas in Chelmsford in about 1624, was the real thing. Not only did she wear fantastic clothes of her own invention, she did not wear quite enough of them. Pepys began by being intrigued when he first saw her on May Day 1667, \"with her velvet cap, her hair about her ears, many black patches because of pimples around her mouth, naked necked (ie bosomed), without anything about it and a black juste au corps - she seemed to me a very comely woman.\" A few days later he saw her \"in her coach with 100 boys and girls running looking upon her\".</p> <p>Madge was by then the Duchess of Newcastle and had published a panegyrical account of her husband's achievements, which included having sex with her in such a way that she did not become pregnant. Like most lechers, Pepys was a prude and was embarrassed to be caught reading \"the ridiculous history of Lord Newcastle wrote by his wife which shows her to be a mad, conceited, ridiculous woman, and he an asse to suffer her to write what she writes to him and of him.\"</p> <p>Only an Essex girl would have referred to her husband's penis as \"nature's posset-maker\". The other courtiers advised Newcastle to shut her up in a dark room till she came to her senses. Her only ambition, Madge was not ashamed to say, was to be famous.</p> <p>Your true Essex girl has much less money than Madge and she tends to spend it unwisely, on convenience food and outings and toys for her kid. If the 21st-century Essex girl dreams of taking her toddler to Disneyland, 19th-century Essex girls played an important part in inventing a separate culture for children. Ann and Jane Taylor, daughters of a nonconformist minister and engraver from Loughton, published Original Poems for Infant Minds in 1805; the book went through at least 50 editions and addled the brains of children for two centuries. Rhymes for the Nursery (1806) contained the four immortal quatrains of mindless nonsense that begin \"Twinkle, twinkle little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky.\"</p> <p>No amount of ridicule could abash the Taylor sisters or limit their runaway success, which was shared by one of their Loughton neighbours, Sarah Catherine Martin, who put together the definitive version of Old Mother Hubbard.

      "bodyText": "There was renewed concern about the Northumberland farm at the centre of the foot and mouth epidemic yesterday, with the local MP criticising lax safety procedures in the run-up to the outbreak and questioning the continued use of pigswill as an animal feed. Meanwhile, anxious neighbours of Burnside Farm, near Heddon-on-the-Wall, said they were dissatisfied with official explanations that nothing could have been done to curb activities at a pig unit labelled squalid and a disaster waiting to happen. The operators of Burnside are now the centre of a national investigation, with officials at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food concentrating on the contents of pigswill made from school meal slops collected in Sunderland and Gateshead. Legislation updated two years ago stipulates that swill-processing premises must be licensed by Maff, while material must be cooked to at least 100C for an hour before it is fed to pigs. Peter Atkinson, Conservative MP for Hexham, said he was staggered that no action was taken after two inspections by Maff alongside county council trading standards officers - the last one on January 24 - as well as a string of complaints to the local district council and environment agency. \"The place was a complete mess and I just think it's amazing that Maff and trading standards officers can go in there and say 'OK, in strict terms, the pigs are in good condition' - an expert who saw them said that on a scale of one to 10 they were seven to eight - but they can walk away from it not knowing there must be a health risk attached to this whole hillbilly operation.\" A week after 500 pigs were incinerated at Bobby and Ronald Waugh's rented holding at Heddon-on-the-Wall, the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, repeated that there was little doubt that Burnside was responsible for the epidemic. \"From the information we have so far, it is clear that the infectivity has been on Burnside Farm for longer than anywhere else in the UK and therefore it is highly likely to be the original source of the outbreak,\" he told the BBC's Close Up North programme. Burnside Farm was inspected by Maff and Northumberland trading standards officers at the end of December and in January after complaints from the RSPCA. Mr Atkinson said that alarm bells should have been ringing after the Waugh brothers were served with an eviction notice from a previous farm they rented from South Tyneside council at East Boldon after failing to undertake substantial improvements demanded by the authority in 1992. They were also fined \u00a31,800 after a slurry leak from the farm. What's going on?

      "body": "<p>The Ministry of Agriculture conceded for the first time yesterday that the foot and mouth outbreak could be called an epidemic, as a record daily total of 17 new cases brought the total in 10 days to 69. But it said it still hoped it could be contained by the continuing freeze on animal movements.</p> <p>One of the new cases is in the middle of Dartmoor on common land where 46,000 animals roam free in the national park, raising fears that all of those animals will have to be destroyed. The National Farmers' Union described this as \"the nightmare scenario\". Ben Bennett, the ministry veterinary officer for the area, said they were urgently investigating whether the cattle and sheep involved had mixed with other animals on the moor.</p> <p>Even before yesterday's outbreaks a total of 53,700 animals had been condemned as part of infected herds and a further 9,965 as \"dangerous contacts\". Only 14,000 have so far been destroyed and incinerated, leaving an enormous logistical problem in getting rid of the rest. Mr Bennett said he was considering asking the army to lend men and machines to help.</p> <p>For the first time since all movement of animals was stopped 10 days ago, animals will be taken from farms for slaughter today. Yesterday 89 abattoirs had been approved to take animals and 143 more were expected to be added today. Licences are being issued by local authorities for each batch of animals but the numbers involved and whether they will be enough to restock shops with British meat is not known.</p> <p>Richard Cawthorne, the deputy chief vet, said that in addition to the 60 confirmed cases there were 122 farms under restriction where possible outbreaks were being investigated. The cases arose out of 3,131 tracings of animals from markets, vehicles and people who had been in contact with contaminated animals.</p> <p>\"I suppose in sheer numbers and spread it could be called an epidemic but the good thing is it is not a random spread. Nearly all can be traced to a direct contact and most are in clusters around those contacts or markets. If we are right ... then numbers of new infections will continue to rise over this week and then decline,\" he said.</p> <p>Of the three new cases confirmed in Devon yesterday, the one at Dunna Bridge Farm, Two Bridges, in the middle of Dartmoor, on the Duchy of Cornwall's estate, gave the most concern.</p> <p>Marion Winsor, the farmer's wife, spoke of her devastation. \"We have done everything at ground level to stop it. We have holed ourselves up here and haven't even seen the postman for a week because he has been leaving things at the end of the drive.\"</p> <p>Mrs Winsor and her husband, Roger, run a 600 acre farm. They have 800 sheep and 170 beef cattle, including Welsh Blacks, and reported one animal looking \"under the weather\". Late yesterday more animals began to show classic mouth and foot symptoms.</p> <p>Most of the animals were on enclosed common land but thousands of other cattle and sheep roam freely on land which adjoins their farm.</p> <p>\u0095 A walker who had to be rescued from Snowdon could face a hefty fine. Mountain rescue teams were called out after he injured himself on a footpath from Llanberis. His rescue comes a day after the Snowdonia national park authority warned that anyone found on paths, pastures or agricultural land in the area would face a \u00a35,000 fine.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\"> Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\"> Interactive guide: tracing the epidemic</a></p> <p><b>Farmer's diary</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369, 444639,00.html\">01.03.2001: At least the milkman gets through</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369, 444735,00.html\">01.03.2001: Threat to census as disease cases grow</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,444711,00.htm l\">01.03.2001: Crippled industry may cost economy \u00a31bn loss</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,444667,00.htm l\">Europe awaits crucial findings</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367, 443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367, 441929,00.html\">Computerised image of the virus</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html \">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">Wh at do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Background</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,441 031,00.html \">21.02.2001, the issue explained: Foot and mouth disease</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369, 444676,00.html\">01.03.200: How fragile virus can weak havoc</a></p> <p><b>The food we eat</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369, 444130,00.html\">28.02.2001: Global trade forces exodus from land</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369, 444099,00.html\">28.02.2001: Bleak future for small farms</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369, 443984,00.html\">28.02.2001: Switch to local suppliers urged to end crisis</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,19147 3,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd\" target=\"_new\">MAFF information and factsheets</a><br> <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/eur- lex/en/lif/dat/1985/en_385L0511.html\" target=\"_new\">EU legislation on the disease</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk/info/f&amp;ml.asp\" target=\"_new\">Latest news from the NFU</a><br><a href=\"http://www.mlc.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Meat and livestock commission</a><br><a href=\"http://www.npa-uk.net\" target=\"_new\">National Pig Association</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.oie.int/eng/maladies/fiches/A_A010.HTM\" target=\"_new\">World organisation for animal health: foot and mouth disease</a></p>",

Nearly all can be traced to a direct contact and most are in clusters around those contacts or markets. If we are right ... then numbers of new infections will continue to rise over this week and then decline,\" he said. Of the three new cases confirmed in Devon yesterday, the one at Dunna Bridge Farm, Two Bridges, in the middle of Dartmoor, on the Duchy of Cornwall's estate, gave the most concern. Marion Winsor, the farmer's wife, spoke of her devastation. \"We have done everything at ground level to stop it. We have holed ourselves up here and haven't even seen the postman for a week because he has been leaving things at the end of the drive.\" Mrs Winsor and her husband, Roger, run a 600 acre farm. They have 800 sheep and 170 beef cattle, including Welsh Blacks, and reported one animal looking \"under the weather\". Late yesterday more animals began to show classic mouth and foot symptoms. Most of the animals were on enclosed common land but thousands of other cattle and sheep roam freely on land which adjoins their farm. \u0095 A walker who had to be rescued from Snowdon could face a hefty fine. Mountain rescue teams were called out after he injured himself on a footpath from Llanberis. His rescue comes a day after the Snowdonia national park authority warned that anyone found on paths, pastures or agricultural land in the area would face a \u00a35,000 fine. What's going on?

      "body": "<p><strong>Observer</strong><br> </p> <p>The productivity gap between <strong> Britain </strong> and the <strong> US</strong> has widened dramatically since Labour came to power, despite numerous government efforts to close it. New data shows that measures taken by the chancellor, <strong> Gordon Brown</strong>, so far have had no significant impact on Britain's productivity performance, a key determinant of increased living standards and prosperity. Mary O'Mahoney, from the <strong>National Institute for Economic and Social Research</strong> - who has updated the figures she used for the Treasury's policy paper on productivity - said: \"The gap has widened by nearly a third.\" </p> <p>The <strong> European Investment Bank</strong> is ready to lend up to \u00a35bn to help rescue a publicly controlled <strong> London Tube</strong>. The EIB money would go to run an Underground network run by London mayor <strong> Ken Livingstone</strong> and his transport supremo <strong>Bob Kiley</strong> at the same rate of interest as offered to the private sector. </p> <p>Shareholders in <strong>ITN</strong> are said to be split over proposals to float the television news provider on the stock market this year. News group <strong>Reuters</strong> is pushing for the company to finalise its listing plans by June but two other shareholders, <strong> Granada</strong> and <strong> Carlton</strong>, fear this is too early. </p> <p><strong>Sunday Telegraph</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> BT</strong> is preparing to abandon plans for a normal stock market flotation of its <strong>BT Wireless</strong> arm in favour of selling the shares at a discount to existing shareholders. BT investors believe the \u00a35bn float outlined in November cannot go ahead because of adverse sentiment in the market towards telecoms companies. </p> <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong>, the ailing retailer, has asked its bankers to draw up plans for the sale and lease-back of 70 stores. The deal, which is in its early stages, would raise about \u00a3200m, depending on which stores are included, but is regarded as testing the market for a concept which could be applied to its entire portfolio if it goes well. </p> <p><strong>Sunday Business</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Kingfisher</strong> is to sell its <strong> Superdrug</strong> chain to Dutch pharmacy group <strong>Kruidvat</strong> for about \u00a3330m in a deal likely to be announced this week. The sale is the first step in the break-up of the \u00a37bn retailing empire built up by Kingfisher chief executive <strong> Sir Geoff Mulcahy</strong>. </p> <p><strong> Emap</strong>, the UK magazines publisher, is understood to have had several offers for its US publishing arm, <strong> Petersen</strong>, valuing the business at close to \u00a3500m. </p> <p><strong>Bass</strong>, the hotels and pubs group, is tipped as favourite to snap up the <strong>Posthouse</strong> hotel chain in a deal worth up to \u00a3700m, ahead of Scottish competitor <strong> Macdonald Hotels</strong>. </p> <p><strong>Sunday Times</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Amazon</strong>, the online retailer, and <strong> Wal-Mart</strong>, the world's biggest shops group, are in secret talks to form a \"strategic alliance\". <strong> Jeff Bezos</strong>, Amazon's billionaire founder, and <strong> Lee Scott</strong>, Wal-Mart's chief executive, are hammering out details of an agreement that could be announced within six weeks. </p> <p>Staff at management advisory firm <strong> PA Consulting</strong> are preparing to share a jackpot after the appointment of <strong> Investec Henderson Crosthwaite</strong> to handle the flotation of <strong> UbiNetics</strong>, the telecoms subsidiary. <strong> Jon Moynihan</strong>, PA's chairman, is aiming to float UbiNetics later this year at a value between \u00a3600m and \u00a31bn. </p> <p><strong>Land Rover</strong> is planning to double its production of the world's most famous off-road vehicles to 300,000 a year by 2005. </p> <p><strong>Mail on Sunday</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> High street banks</strong> face a blistering attack this week over their small business operations when the <strong> competition commission</strong> releases initial findings of its investigation. The banks are likely to be told to make it easier for customers to shop around and switch their accounts, obliged to offer overdrafts that cannot be withdrawn by them without notice, and forced to trim high charges on credit cards. </p> <p><strong>IoS</strong><br> </p> <p>The <strong> Football Association</strong> is to save the redevelopment of <strong> Wembley stadium</strong> by guaranteeing over \u00a3400m of loans from City bankers. </p> <p><strong> Stuart Rose</strong>, the new chief executive of <strong> Arcadia</strong>, is to axe <strong>Miss Selfridge</strong> as part of a radical overhaul of the retailer's stores. </p> <p><strong>Reports out this week</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Today</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Interims</strong> Benchmark, Close Brothers Group, Groupe Chez Gerard, Interior Services Group, Redrow. <strong> Finals </strong> Aggregate Industries, British Vita, Eadie Holdings, Exel, Guardian IT, Hammerson, Inchcape, Molins, Pearson, Thistle Hotels, Vitec Group, Waste Recycling Group, Waterford Wedgwood, Wilson Connolly (Holdings). <strong> AGMs</strong> Hill &amp; Smith Holdings. <strong> EGMs</strong> Hunting. </p> <p><strong> Tuesday</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Interims</strong> FTV Group, ICM Computer Group, IDN Group, Linx Printing Technologies, Savills (8 mths), Thorntons. </p> <p><strong> Finals</strong> Balfour Beatty, BBA Group, Beeson Gregory, Cairn Energy, Caradon, CRH, Independent Insurers, Informa Group, IQ Ludorum, Meggitt, Old Mutual, Parity Group, Pittards, RiverSoft, RJB, Tibbett &amp; Britten, Tranxenogen, WSP Group. <strong> AGMs</strong> None scheduled. <strong> EGMs</strong> African Lakes. </p> <p><strong> Wednesday</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Interims</strong> InterX, Morse, A&amp;J Mucklow. <strong> Finals</strong> Amec, Biotrace International, BV Group, Britannic, Coats Viyella, Communisis, Genetix Group, Glanbia, Holmes Place, Wealth Management Software. <strong> AGMs</strong> NHP. <strong> EGMs</strong> Aortech, Magic Moments. </p> <p><strong> Thursday</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Finals </strong> Arriva, Axis-Shield, T Clarke, Compass Software Group, Cordiant Communications, Countryside Assured, Enterprise Oil, Esporta, Irish Life &amp; Permanent, Marshalls, John Mowlem, Music Choice Europe, Queens Moat Houses, Rexam, Travis Perkins <strong> AGMs</strong> None scheduled. <strong> EGMs </strong> None scheduled. </p> <p><strong> Friday</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Interims</strong> Canary Wharf, JD Wetherspoon. <strong> Finals</strong> Exchange FS Group, Greggs, SIG. <strong> AGMs </strong> None scheduled. <strong> EGMs</strong> NetB2B2, Severfield-Rowen. </p> <p><strong> Indicators this week</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Today</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> UK </strong> Services sector PMI. <strong> UK</strong> Provisional M0. <strong> UK</strong> Official reserves (Feb). <strong> EU</strong> Euro zone PMI services survey (Feb). </p> <p><strong> GER</strong> PMI services survey (Feb). <strong> JP </strong> BoJ monetary policy board meeting minutes (Jan). </p> <p><strong> Tuesday</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> UK</strong> Retail sales monitor (Feb). <strong> UK </strong> Halifax house price index (Feb). <strong> US</strong> Revised labour productivity (Q4). <strong> US</strong> Factory orders (Jan). </p> <p><strong> Wednesday</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> UK</strong> Budget. <strong> UK</strong> BoE MPC meeting starts. <strong> US</strong> Federal Reserve beige book survey of current economic conditions.<strong> US</strong> Consumer credit (Jan). </p> <p><strong> Thursday</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> UK</strong> BoE MPC meeting decision. <strong> UK</strong> New construction orders (Jan). <strong> UK</strong> Housing starts (Jan). </p> <p><strong> Friday</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> UK</strong> Industrial production (Jan).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Observer The productivity gap between Britain and the US has widened dramatically since Labour came to power, despite numerous government efforts to close it. New data shows that measures taken by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, so far have had no significant impact on Britain's productivity performance, a key determinant of increased living standards and prosperity. Mary O'Mahoney, from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research - who has updated the figures she used for the Treasury's policy paper on productivity - said: \"The gap has widened by nearly a third.\" The European Investment Bank is ready to lend up to \u00a35bn to help rescue a publicly controlled London Tube. The EIB money would go to run an Underground network run by London mayor Ken Livingstone and his transport supremo Bob Kiley at the same rate of interest as offered to the private sector. Shareholders in ITN are said to be split over proposals to float the television news provider on the stock market this year. News group Reuters is pushing for the company to finalise its listing plans by June but two other shareholders, Granada and Carlton, fear this is too early. Sunday Telegraph BT is preparing to abandon plans for a normal stock market flotation of its BT Wireless arm in favour of selling the shares at a discount to existing shareholders. BT investors believe the \u00a35bn float outlined in November cannot go ahead because of adverse sentiment in the market towards telecoms companies. Marks &amp; Spencer, the ailing retailer, has asked its bankers to draw up plans for the sale and lease-back of 70 stores. The deal, which is in its early stages, would raise about \u00a3200m, depending on which stores are included, but is regarded as testing the market for a concept which could be applied to its entire portfolio if it goes well. Sunday Business Kingfisher is to sell its Superdrug chain to Dutch pharmacy group Kruidvat for about \u00a3330m in a deal likely to be announced this week. The sale is the first step in the break-up of the \u00a37bn retailing empire built up by Kingfisher chief executive Sir Geoff Mulcahy. Emap, the UK magazines publisher, is understood to have had several offers for its US publishing arm, Petersen, valuing the business at close to \u00a3500m. Bass, the hotels and pubs group, is tipped as favourite to snap up the Posthouse hotel chain in a deal worth up to \u00a3700m, ahead of Scottish competitor Macdonald Hotels. Sunday Times Amazon, the online retailer, and Wal-Mart, the world's biggest shops group, are in secret talks to form a \"strategic alliance\". Jeff Bezos, Amazon's billionaire founder, and Lee Scott, Wal-Mart's chief executive, are hammering out details of an agreement that could be announced within six weeks. Staff at management advisory firm PA Consulting are preparing to share a jackpot after the appointment of Investec Henderson Crosthwaite to handle the flotation of UbiNetics, the telecoms subsidiary. Jon Moynihan, PA's chairman, is aiming to float UbiNetics later this year at a value between \u00a3600m and \u00a31bn. Land Rover is planning to double its production of the world's most famous off-road vehicles to 300,000 a year by 2005. Mail on Sunday High street banks face a blistering attack this week over their small business operations when the competition commission releases initial findings of its investigation. The banks are likely to be told to make it easier for customers to shop around and switch their accounts, obliged to offer overdrafts that cannot be withdrawn by them without notice, and forced to trim high charges on credit cards. IoS The Football Association is to save the redevelopment of Wembley stadium by guaranteeing over \u00a3400m of loans from City bankers. Stuart Rose, the new chief executive of Arcadia, is to axe Miss Selfridge as part of a radical overhaul of the retailer's stores.

The scientists believe that the chances of the killer gene spreading beyond the species it is intended to harm, the pink bollworm, is very small, and would do no harm if it did. </p> <p>But the US department of agriculture still has to give consent for the first part of the trial, which would involve a tightly controlled release of moths with another gene inserted to track any possible cross-species transfer. </p> <p>Scientists need to target the bollworm larvae, which feed on cotton plants, before developing into moths. The idea is to take insect eggs in the lab and insert into their DNA a gene from a fruit fly which would normally damage their metabolism so badly that they would die. </p> <p>In the lab, however, the larvae survive, because they are dosed with an antidote to the effects of the killer gene. They will grow into adult moths, which are naturally immune to the effects of the gene, and will then be released over the cotton fields in huge numbers. </p> <p>Unaware that by mating they are both creating and assassinating the next generation, the GM moths will mate with wild moths and each other. The female moths will lay their eggs as normal. But their offspring will have inherited the killer gene. In the wild, the larvae will find no antidote and will die. </p> <p>In the initial trial, which could take place next year, 3,600 moths will be given a jellyfish gene that glows under special light instead of the killer gene. This will show what happens to GM insects when they encounter their wild counterparts and other species.</p>",

The scientists believe that the chances of the killer gene spreading beyond the species it is intended to harm, the pink bollworm, is very small, and would do no harm if it did. But the US department of agriculture still has to give consent for the first part of the trial, which would involve a tightly controlled release of moths with another gene inserted to track any possible cross-species transfer. Scientists need to target the bollworm larvae, which feed on cotton plants, before developing into moths. The idea is to take insect eggs in the lab and insert into their DNA a gene from a fruit fly which would normally damage their metabolism so badly that they would die. In the lab, however, the larvae survive, because they are dosed with an antidote to the effects of the killer gene. They will grow into adult moths, which are naturally immune to the effects of the gene, and will then be released over the cotton fields in huge numbers. Unaware that by mating they are both creating and assassinating the next generation, the GM moths will mate with wild moths and each other. The female moths will lay their eggs as normal. But their offspring will have inherited the killer gene. In the wild, the larvae will find no antidote and will die. In the initial trial, which could take place next year, 3,600 moths will be given a jellyfish gene that glows under special light instead of the killer gene. This will show what happens to GM insects when they encounter their wild counterparts and other species.",

It will involve making three journeys this season - the first, a few weeks ago, saw her shuttling between Flaine, Chamonix and Grenoble in France, in just 72 hours. </p> <p>\"I talked to our people, checked their paperwork, and skied with them,\" says Ryan. \"When I wasn't doing that, I met ski school contacts and the holiday groups, or looked at potential accommodation for the future. There wasn't time to swan around, believe me.\" </p> <p>Ryan, 27, has a degree in languages and business, for which she studied French and German, and she was torn between either \"a serious City-type role, earning lots of money, or a bit of fun which was interesting\". A former rep herself, she had been running an Alpine hotel before joining the Ski Club at its Wimbledon base in November 1999. </p> <p>Her linguistic skills are put to regular use. \"I often deal with hoteliers and tourist offices, and in the summer, I negotiate bed, board and lift pass packages for the reps. The French seem genuinely surprised that I actually understand what they're saying. That's quite noticeable. I haven't got any Italian - although my assistant has, fortunately.\" </p> <p>She also organises pre-season training in Tignes, France. This involves tuition in mountaincraft by qualified guides, and Ryan talking her charges through the finer points of maintaining efficient records. </p> <p>\"They're tired out after a day on the snow, and I'm saying to them, 'Right, get your pencils. Here's how you fill in your returns sheets and resort diaries.' But the admin is important, and without it, my whole system would fall apart.\" </p> <p>Delivering a presentation holds no fears for her. \"Initially, it was intimidating,\" she admits. \"With experience, I've found it's not a problem.\" And in that sort of environment, she adds, it is possible to have a laugh and a joke. </p> <p>Thanks to her background, Ryan knows a thing or two about being the life and soul of the slopes. There is a social aspect to the course - positively heroic amounts of apr\u00e8s-ski lie ahead - and it lets her see for herself how these prospective party animals shape up. \"Yes, a certain amount of research is done at the bar,\" she says, dead-pan. </p> <p>The fact that the reps are volunteers - shop assistants and helicopter pilots feature in the current crop - means they won't all be present for the entire season. (The majority can spare less than a month, anyway). So Ryan's biggest challenge is to find cover when someone cries off. If she's told early enough, it isn't a major issue. However, she sometimes gets just one or two weeks' notice (and it can be less). \"They'll say, 'Look, I'm sorry, but I've got to work instead'.\" </p> <p>Ryan's opinions vary at this stage. \"Part of me wants to make them feel as guilty as possible, so I'll reply, 'Well, my boss will probably tell me to take a hike, and to take my P45, too'.\" And on the other hand? \"This is a difficult situation - they haven't signed a legally binding contract, just a repping agreement, and I can't demand anything, which is a pain.\" </p> <p>Even the boxes of chocolates sent in apology fail to ease the situation. Her solution is a \"long, long list\" of those who could be available at the last minute, \"and I phone around like a madwoman\". </p> <p>Ryan calls each rep on a weekly basis - she likes to be kept informed about what's happening, and occasionally, information overload sets in. \"One guy was bursting to tell his news about the couple who had a daughter, and how she went to the same school as his little girl. Rather nice for him, but I was more interested in finding out where they were going skiing.\" </p> <p>Asked what it takes to forge a career in the travel trade, Ryan says: \"Stamina helps. I've been in the office as late as 11pm, and working at home at weekends is common. In return, there's probably more variety and greater job satisfaction than in other industries, but you have got to be totally committed. It can take over.\"</p>",

Her linguistic skills are put to regular use. \"I often deal with hoteliers and tourist offices, and in the summer, I negotiate bed, board and lift pass packages for the reps. The French seem genuinely surprised that I actually understand what they're saying. That's quite noticeable. I haven't got any Italian - although my assistant has, fortunately.\" She also organises pre-season training in Tignes, France. This involves tuition in mountaincraft by qualified guides, and Ryan talking her charges through the finer points of maintaining efficient records. \"They're tired out after a day on the snow, and I'm saying to them, 'Right, get your pencils. Here's how you fill in your returns sheets and resort diaries.' But the admin is important, and without it, my whole system would fall apart.\" Delivering a presentation holds no fears for her. \"Initially, it was intimidating,\" she admits. \"With experience, I've found it's not a problem.\" And in that sort of environment, she adds, it is possible to have a laugh and a joke. Thanks to her background, Ryan knows a thing or two about being the life and soul of the slopes. There is a social aspect to the course - positively heroic amounts of apr\u00e8s-ski lie ahead - and it lets her see for herself how these prospective party animals shape up. \"Yes, a certain amount of research is done at the bar,\" she says, dead-pan. The fact that the reps are volunteers - shop assistants and helicopter pilots feature in the current crop - means they won't all be present for the entire season. (The majority can spare less than a month, anyway). So Ryan's biggest challenge is to find cover when someone cries off. If she's told early enough, it isn't a major issue. However, she sometimes gets just one or two weeks' notice (and it can be less). \"They'll say, 'Look, I'm sorry, but I've got to work instead'.\" Ryan's opinions vary at this stage. \"Part of me wants to make them feel as guilty as possible, so I'll reply, 'Well, my boss will probably tell me to take a hike, and to take my P45, too'.\" And on the other hand? \"This is a difficult situation - they haven't signed a legally binding contract, just a repping agreement, and I can't demand anything, which is a pain.\" Even the boxes of chocolates sent in apology fail to ease the situation. Her solution is a \"long, long list\" of those who could be available at the last minute, \"and I phone around like a madwoman\". Ryan calls each rep on a weekly basis - she likes to be kept informed about what's happening, and occasionally, information overload sets in. \"One guy was bursting to tell his news about the couple who had a daughter, and how she went to the same school as his little girl. Rather nice for him, but I was more interested in finding out where they were going skiing.\" Asked what it takes to forge a career in the travel trade, Ryan says: \"Stamina helps. I've been in the office as late as 11pm, and working at home at weekends is common. In return, there's probably more variety and greater job satisfaction than in other industries, but you have got to be totally committed. It can take over.\"",

      "bodyText": "The US built a secret tunnel under the Soviet Union's embassy in Washington to spy on its rival superpower, it has emerged in the wake of the arrest of an FBI agent for spying. The agent, Robert Hanssen, who was arrested last month, is believed to have disclosed the existence of the tunnel to his Soviet contacts years ago. The vice president, Dick Cheney, said in a radio interview yesterday that, if the story about the tunnel was true, he could not comment on it. The construction of the tunnel and related intelligence-gathering facilities is estimated to have cost the US government several hundred million dollars, according to yesterday's New York Times. Its aim was to create a method of eavesdropping on the Soviet Union's embassy. It was built during the 70s and 80s, according to former agents, and did not become properly functional until the early 90s. Mr Hanssen has maintained his innocence and commentators speculate that the leaking of the details of the tunnel may be a way of letting him know that everything is known about the information he supplied. The FBI court papers state merely that Mr Hanssen \"compromised an entire technical programme of enormous value, expense and importance to the United States government\" and this is understood to be a reference to the tunnel. It is alleged that Mr Hanssen, who was arrested on February 15, was spying for the Soviet Union, and later the Russians,for 25 years. The tunnel was built under the Soviet embassy complex, as it then was, on Wisconsin Avenue in Washington. The embassy was not fully occupied for a number of years because of a dispute over US claims that its Moscow embassy had been bugged. According to former intelligence agents, there is no evidence that the tunnel ever produced any useful information, an indication that the Soviet Union knew of its existence. If convicted on the spying charges, Hanssen could face the death penalty, not least because he is alleged to have passed on information that led to the deaths of US agents.",

Hopefully there will be plenty of runners as people will want to get a run into their horses.\" However, the two other meetings set for Wednesday at Bangor and Catterick have already been cancelled because of the foot and mouth crisis and a similar fate has befallen all Thursday's scheduled meetings at Carlisle, Towcester and Wincanton. The British Horseracing Board will make a decision today on a replacement fixture to avoid Thursday being a blank day. There is better news later in the week with officials at Sandown Park satisfied at this stage that their two-day meeting for Friday and Saturday can go ahead. Ayr, where racing is also due to take place on those two days are expected to make a decision today. Friday's third meeting is at Hereford where racing was said to be doubtful yesterday. \"I would say that the meeting is very much in doubt because Hereford is an agricultural area and we would not want to do anything to upset our customers,\" said Hereford managing director Simon Clarke. Chepstow, who have a fixture on Saturday, believe they are still in an exclusion zone but Warwick are optimistic that they will get the green light for their fixture on the same day. While a return to racing, even of the most modest variety, will be warmly embraced the main focus of the collective attention is cast, anxiously, towards the Cheltenham Festival. Yesterday Edward Gillespie, the managing director, and Simon Claisse, the clerk of the course, continued to plan for the start of the meeting next Tuesday all the while aware that a suspected outbreak at a farm at nearby Woolstone was still under investigation. Claisse said: \"I gather that the farm at Woolstone came under suspicion because there was a possibility that some of the stock may have come into contact with stock at another farm. As every hour goes past we get more hopeful but we are aware that the situation could change at any time.\" One situation that will not change is the Irish boycott, but their indefinite ban on racing could have serious consequences for their Flat yards. Aidan O'Brien has a formidable crop of three-year-olds but nowhere to run them as matters stand. One of the stars of his Ballydoyle stable is Minardi, owned in partnership by Michael Tabor and Sue Magnier. Minardi was rated the top two-year-old in Europe last season and would be a main contender for the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket in May. Victory would assure him a sizeable stud valuation but with both that, and the Irish equivalent, not possible in the present situation the only option could be the French Guineas as the Irish Ministry of Agriculture deems travelling to France to be \"no problem at the moment.\" Tabor said: \"To be honest with you I haven't even discussed it but I'm sure we are looking in that direction and it will be something that we will be monitoring.\" What's going on?

One Taliban source said the statues had not yet been damaged but the work could start at any time. The regime's information minister, Qudratullah Jamal, said the statues and scores of other artefacts across the country were gradually being dismantled. Residents of central Bamiyan, where the two ancient statues of Buddha hewn from a cliff face in the third and fifth centuries are located, said they had seen soldiers firing anti-aircraft weapons at the two statues three days ago. The statues stand as evidence of the Greek and Buddhist cultures that flourished in Afghanistan centuries before the arrival of Islam.

Analysts said the edict might be an attempt to bargain with the west.

Sami-ul Haq, a cleric who runs one of Asia's most influential Islamic schools and who is highly regarded by the Taliban, said the regime was wrong to begin destroying the ancient Buddhist monuments. \"The worship places of the idolaters were preserved so the people could learn a lesson from them,\" said Mr Haq.

A Unesco special envoy, Pierre Lafrance, met Mr Haq yesterday before flying to Afghanistan for talks with senior Taliban ministers in a last-ditch effort to reverse the ruling.

All the paraphernalia - the Budget box, the peck on the cheek outside 11 Downing Street, the obsessive secrecy - mark out the occasion as a big day in the nation's calendar. And when the chancellor is banging away at the despatch box about the cyclically adjusted budget deficit, it is easy to believe that nothing much has changed since Gladstone's day, and that the world is still run from the mother of parliaments. </p> <p>Of course, buried away in the speech, there is recognition that there is an international dimension to tax and spending decisions. But the moment Gordon Brown says, \"the global outlook is less promising than it was in November\", is the moment 99% of those listening hit the snooze button. </p> <p>Yet this year, even more than most, the world matters. Indeed, what is going on in the United States and Japan, the two biggest economies, will have a bigger impact on our lives than anything Brown has up his sleeve. This, for those who are interested, will be the usual four-stage affair - prudence for the City, a few goodies for business, redistribution through his plethora of tax credits and something for old Labour at the end. </p> <p>Brown's strategy is for his package to have minimum impact on the markets and maximum impact on the voters, and he will almost certainly succeed. The Treasury's deliberate policy of underestimating the size of the budget surplus means that the chancellor can stick to his plans for repaying debt while having a few more billions to spare for tax cuts and spending increases. There is not much chance that the Bank of England will respond to the Budget by putting up interest rates in the foreseeable future; the only question is whether it might be deterred from cutting them by too much generosity from the chancellor. Given the present level of inflation, the answer is probably not. </p> <p>By contrast, external events look far more threatening to Brown's economic forecasts and fiscal arithmetic. First, there is the US, a country which could be almost a textbook case of Brown's warnings about boom and bust. The lights went out for the US in November last year, and if the markets are anything to go by, may not come on again for some time. This week will see the anniversary of the day when the Nasdaq index peaked at just over 5,000 points. In the subsequent 12 months it has lost 60% of its value and, with the profits warnings rolling in relentlessly, may still have further to fall. Indicators of both business and consumer confidence have fallen sharply in recent months, and there is a risk that an increase in consumer saving, savage cutbacks in the corporate sector and the falling stock market will create a vicious downward spiral. Policymakers have a considerable degree of flexibility, with scope for both fiscal and monetary easing, but once an economy is heading down it is hard to turn it around. The real question for the US this year is whether Greenspan's rate cuts and Bush's tax cuts get to the economy before confidence really cracks. </p> <p><strong>Lesson from the past</strong><br> </p> <p>Interestingly, some analysts are now drawing parallels with what happened after the Japanese bubble burst a decade ago. This is premature, but it does highlight the extent to which Japan has blundered its way through the 1990s and still lacks a coherent recovery strategy. If Japan were as close geographically to Britain as Germany or France, we would be hearing about its economic woes every day. As it is, the fact that it stands to be the first leading developed nation since the war to replicate the conditions of the 1930s has escaped attention. Last week, for example, there was news that industrial production had fallen by almost 4% in January, that core prices in Tokyo were falling at an annual rate of 1.1%, and unemployment was nudging 5%. The Nikkei Dow index ended the week at its lowest level for 15 years, and some 60% below its peak level. There are those who believe that Japan is essentially a strong economy which is poised to be a world leader in the next phase of the internet revolution. But while it was true that parts of its economy are incredibly efficient and are at the cutting edge of scientific advance, the same could be said of the Soviet Union in the 1950s. </p> <p>After months in which it had boasted that the country had at last turned the corner, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party said it would come up with an emergency package of measures to boost the stock market and boost the liquidity of the real estate market. The fact that Japan's government has removed its head from the sand is certainly welcome, although it has yet to provide a shred of evidence that it knows how to get the country out of its mess. One idea floated last week - that banks should be encouraged to get rid of their bad loans - sounds like the sort of structural reform that might help transform Japan into a vibrant American-style economy, but in the circumstances pulling the plug on debtors and creating a fresh wave of bankruptcies is the last thing the country needs. The result would be a further downward lurch in land prices, which have fallen in tandem with the stock market, but are seven times as important to the Japanese personal sector. Putting a floor under land prices is the key to stabilising the economy and creating the conditions for stronger growth. </p> <p><strong>Blunt weapons</strong><br> </p> <p>The problem for the Japanese authorities is that they appear to have exhausted all the normal policy options. For an economy as moribund as Japan's, the classic remedy would be zero or even negative real interest rates, but this is impossible when inflation is negative. However low nominal rates of interest go, they still remain positive in real terms. For much of the 1990s, Japan tried stimulatory fiscal policies, and the Keynesian approach worked up to a point, in that things would now be a lot worse had the government not spent trillions of yen on infrastructure projects. But with public debt exploding, fiscal policy is now the bluntest of policy weapons, because the private sector is well aware that the price of higher borrowing now will be higher taxes later. </p> <p>In the light of all this, unorthodox remedies are now being suggested. Paul Krugman thinks the Japanese should print money as a way of pushing inflation into positive territory, thereby making it possible for the authorities to engineer zero real rates of interest. Variations of the Krugman thesis include setting an inflation target of 2.5%, thereby massaging expectations, and the approach used by Roosevelt when he arrived in office in 1933 - printing money and a devaluation. One particularly radical solution floated is that Japan should nationalised the banks and the even more sickly life insurers and impose a moratorium on interest repayments for three years. </p> <p>Such a move, it is argued, would stem the rising tide of bankruptcies, put a brake on falling land prices and restore confidence. Certainly, something drastic is needed because the rest of Asia is already feeling the backwash from Japan's latest travails. The UK economy at present seems reasonably healthy, and managed - just - to ride out the last Asian crisis in 1998. But that was when the US was in the last heady days of the boom that was never supposed to end. It will not be nearly so comfortable here if the US, Japan and the rest of the Pacific Rim all go down the tubes. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:\" larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Victor Chandler, the pioneer of tax-free offshore betting, has dismissed government plans to lure bookmakers back to Britain - which are expected to be announced in the Budget on Wednesday - as unworkable. </p> <p>Mr Chandler, right, chairman of Victor Chandler International, said the proposed scrapping of the 9% duty on winnings in favour of a tax on bookmakers' gross profits would not deter punters from looking to offshore websites and call centres for more attractive odds rather than using local bookmakers such as that pictured above. </p> <p>Mr Chandler, who triggered an industry-wide rush to establish offshore operations when he set up business in Gibraltar in 1997, said: \"The stable door has been opened and the horse has bolted.\" </p> <p>He also attacked proposals from five leading British bookmakers - Ladbrokes, Coral, William Hill, Stanley Leisure and the Tote - to abandon their offshore operations if Gordon Brown sets the rate of tax on bookmakers' profits at 15%. \"It equates to a 3% betting duty - and that will be passed on to the punter,\" he said. \"The punter will always suffer. Meanwhile, VCI offers as good a service but with better odds. People are still going to find us, even if government restricts our advertising.\" </p> <p>Last year, advertisements on Teletext for odds offered by VCI were banned by the court of appeal. </p> <p>According to analysts at Datamonitor, online betting in Europe could be worth as much as as \u00a33.5bn by 2004. \"You have to remember, we are not as Anglo-centric as the big three [Ladbrokes, William Hill and Coral],\" Mr Chandler said. </p> <p>The Gibraltar-based operation has successfully wooed high rollers in Hong Kong and Singapore with the prospect of tax-free bets on football matches and other sporting events. As a result, the company that was founded by Mr Chandler's grandfather - also named Victor Chandler - has been transformed from a track-side bookmaker into an international business.</p>",

Mr Chandler, right, chairman of Victor Chandler International, said the proposed scrapping of the 9% duty on winnings in favour of a tax on bookmakers' gross profits would not deter punters from looking to offshore websites and call centres for more attractive odds rather than using local bookmakers such as that pictured above. Mr Chandler, who triggered an industry-wide rush to establish offshore operations when he set up business in Gibraltar in 1997, said: \"The stable door has been opened and the horse has bolted.\" He also attacked proposals from five leading British bookmakers - Ladbrokes, Coral, William Hill, Stanley Leisure and the Tote - to abandon their offshore operations if Gordon Brown sets the rate of tax on bookmakers' profits at 15%. \"It equates to a 3% betting duty - and that will be passed on to the punter,\" he said. \"The punter will always suffer. Meanwhile, VCI offers as good a service but with better odds. People are still going to find us, even if government restricts our advertising.\" Last year, advertisements on Teletext for odds offered by VCI were banned by the court of appeal. According to analysts at Datamonitor, online betting in Europe could be worth as much as as \u00a33.5bn by 2004. \"You have to remember, we are not as Anglo-centric as the big three [Ladbrokes, William Hill and Coral],\" Mr Chandler said. The Gibraltar-based operation has successfully wooed high rollers in Hong Kong and Singapore with the prospect of tax-free bets on football matches and other sporting events. As a result, the company that was founded by Mr Chandler's grandfather - also named Victor Chandler - has been transformed from a track-side bookmaker into an international business.",

Would her brief sojourn back in the field have been anything to do with the BBC's \u00a355 cap on hotel bills, Monkey wonders? </p> <p> \u0095 Talking about stars with fat salaries, speculation is rife about the future of the BBC's economics editor, Peter Jay. He was stripped of his business brief when Jeff Randall - who starts work today - was appointed: now insiders say he may retire sooner than planned. Newsnight's chirpy economics man, Evan Davis, is regarded as an ideal replacement. </p> <p> \u0095 By the slightest of margins, Davis must take second place to the garrulous Richard Quest in Monkey's top ten of business hacks. In his 15 years at the BBC, he has shown more enthusiasm for the Dow Jones than is good for the health: now he has taken his populist style to CNN. Sitting at the CNN table at the Royal Television Society journalism awards this week, Monkey took the opportunity to alert his new bosses to a rather intriguing episode in the Quest files: the platinum blond era. When questioned, Quest said it was something to do with Sydney Mardi Gras. We felt it best not to inquire further. </p> <p> \u0095 There was far too little bad behaviour at the RTS awards this year: only one lady fell over, and no one punched Peter Horrocks on the nose. Which is just as well for the BBC current affairs chief, whose Panorama team dominated the ceremony. While the awards for John Ware's Who Bombed Omagh? were clearly deserved, Mark Austin's memorable ITN report from the Mozambique floods only got a technician's award. Some observers wondered how long the industry snobbery towards ITV's news coverage can continue. </p> <p> \u0095 To the delight of Richard Sambrook, the new director of BBC news and a News 24 champion, the rolling news channel took a number of gongs, while Sky News failed to land a single award. The disappointed satellite contingent muttered darkly that its head of news, Nick Pollard, would have some serious questions to answer back at the office - he chaired this year's judges. But there is a positive side to Sky's failure: at least its impartiality can't be questioned. </p> <p> \u0095 Just in case his 30-something wife hasn't worked it out herself, Rupert Murdoch has helpfully calculated just how long he will grace the world with his presence. Asked, at a conference in New York, how he felt about turning 70 next month, he joked: \"Bad\", quickly adding he had approximately 175,000 hours left, after factoring out sleeping, family time and \"other useless meetings\". Since Murdoch is trying to pull off a \u00a343bn merger with a car company that has satellite interests, he added: \"I just hope that not too many of them are taken up by negotiations with General Motors.\"</p> <p> \u0095 One presenter who can say goodbye to his chances of anchoring ITV's election night - he hosted poll coverage back in 1992, but then fell out of favour - is Jon Snow. Replying to his attack on ITV current affairs, a menacing network statement said Snow and his C4 News team would be \"out of a job\" without ITN's ITV contract. Yesterday, news 'n' current affairs nabob Steve Anderson sneered that Snow's own \"most recent foray\" into gritty journalism was his Monica Lewinsky interview. Seconds out! Both men work in \"Liddy's Lubianka\", the ITV/ITN glass palace on Gray's Inn Road, so hiring minders could be advisable. </p> <p> \u0095 Thanks, Virgin, for your cheery postcard bragging that Chris Evans hosts the most-listened-to \"national commercial breakfast show\". As it's the only pop-based national commercial breakfast show, however, Monkey suspects this may not be a significant achievement. </p> <p> \u0095 Overheard from a sulking top Sky exec at last week's RTS journalism awards (where the BBC garnered most of the gongs): \"What's the point of having [Sky News head] Nick Pollard as awards chair, if this is the outcome?\" </p> <p> \u0095 Scuttlebutt at the RTS ceremony suggested that BBC biz boss Jeff Randall's arrival at TV Centre will shortly be followed by rarely-sighted (but formerly Birt-protected) economics editor Peter Jay finally converting inactivity into formal retirement - with Newsnight's Evan Davis a possible replacement. Talked of as in line for promotion too is World Service chief Mark Byford, the Beeb's sole surviving Birtist. Supporters tip him to take over Margaret Salmon's job at BBC Resources. But is that promotion? </p> <p> \u0095 Also rarely glimpsed is BBC chief news correspondent Kate \"Angel of Death\" Adie, but she covered the Selby rail crash. Why was her Yorkshire sojourn limited to a single day, though? Anything to do with the Beeb's \u00a355 cap on hotel bills? </p> <p>* Good to see adland responding swiftly to last year's IPA report on women in advertising, which slammed the industry's laddish sexism. A graduate recruitment ad last week for top media agency Carat featured a bosomy babe clad in hot-pants and stilettos, blowing a kiss. The headline? \"Where's the best place to touch her?\" </p> <p>*Newsdesks including the Times, Telegraph and Mail eagerly followed up last week's Indy piece on Shakespeare and dope.

      "body": "<p>As children my friends and I used to point at the Albert Memorial in London's Kensington Gardens and say it was Britain's entry into the space race. We Brits chose to live in neo-Georgian homes and drive mock-Tudor cars (even the Pop-era Mini estate was framed, like its automotive auntie the Morris Minor Traveller, in timber beams), so a neo-Gothic rocket was just the sort of contraption we would come up with to challenge the Soviets and Americans. </p> <p>These memories orbited my mind as I travelled through the outskirts of north Leicester, a bleak industrial wasteland of Victorian red brick and inter-war factories and warehouses. Would anyone really expect to find the new heart - or brain - of Britain's space challenge here, in the flattest part of the Midlands? It's not exactly Cape Kennedy. And there's not a hint here of the gleaming white imagery of Stanley Kubrick's magisterial 2001: A Space Odyssey. </p> <p>But then the tower of the new lottery-fuelled National Space Centre launches into view, rising above the factory roofs and the sodden banks of the River Soar like some giant prop from a 1950s sci-fi film. The very nearly completed building is glamorous in a Boy's Own, Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future, way. Unlike some other over-optimistic millennium museums and galleries in regional towns and cities, this one seems bound to draw the audience it needs to make it a success. The centre aims to attract no more than 300,000 visitors a year, mostly children on school trips, although it should do better than that. </p> <p>Why the confidence? First, because this is not just another museum dedicated to showing a few exhausted rockets and redundant satellites, but a live space centre, connected via the University of Leicester to real space exploration. Satellites will be controlled from here, and if all goes to plan, new equipment will be built in sight of visitors. This will include the Beagle-2 probe, a Martian explorer, due to be launched by the European \"Mars Express\" team in June 2003. </p> <p>Secondly, the education programme is one of the best around. In the Challenger learning centre, children get to work as astronauts and mission controllers in realistic simulations designed to tax their imagination as well as to help them understand the importance of teamwork. Thirdly, Nicholas Grimshaw's team of architects and engineers have designed one of the most distinctive and intriguing new buildings in Britain, one that everyone interested in buildings will want to see. </p> <p>You can't miss the tower. It's tall, a curious shape, shrouds a brace of spindly space rockets - and it's clad in what looks like a translucent version of the Puffa jacket. Set between curved steel frames, the tower's cladding is made up of a soft, jellyfish-like grid of what are essentially inflatable plastic pillows. The material is ETFE, a self-cleaning plastic, resistant to damage or discoloration from ultraviolet light. So in 20 years' time this eye-catching and revolutionary tower should look much as it does now. And if some guttersnipe decides to take a crack at the tower's inflatable skin with an air-rifle, the pellets will merely sink into the pillows, then pop back out again as the material regains its shape. </p> <p>The interior of the tower is reached via an elevated walkway inside the main body of the centre. This is a voluminous stainless-steel warehouse set low in what was the storm overflow tank of the old sewage and waterworks next door. This low-lying building contains, aside from shop and cafe, a small, superbly orchestrated \"space theatre\" or planetarium. Outside the building this appears in the guise of a Buckminster Fuller-like dome, a clever foil to the complex profile of the tower. </p> <p>The rest of this air-conditioned box of tricks is taken up by displays and exhibits, with pride of place given to a dusty-green Soyuz spacecraft. The upper walkway leads from the darkness of the main building into the light-filled tower, which can also be reached by two sci-fi pod lifts. The views down the shafts of the rockets, up to the old sputniks dangling from the apex of the roof, and through the inflated ETFE pillows across Leicester, are thrilling. </p> <p>From the top of the tower it's possible to see the project as a whole. Below, the buildings radiate out from the centre point of the dome of the space theatre, moving in a spiral out through the landscaped grounds and car park - and then, if you use your imagination, beyond the flatlands of Leicester and into infinity </p> <p>It's up to the city of Leicester, not the country's most romantic destination yet one of the hubs of the international space industry, to promote this new attraction imaginatively. Not only is the space age beginning to interest a new generation ignorant of Neil Armstrong, but Nicholas Grimshaw and his team have produced a building that will excite the imagination of both the children who queue to see the animatronic tyrannosaurus in the Natural History Museum, and those of us who believed that one day, some time around 2001, we'd be flying around the universe in sleek spacecraft. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The National Space Centre, Leicester, opens on June 30.</p>",

And there's not a hint here of the gleaming white imagery of Stanley Kubrick's magisterial 2001: A Space Odyssey. But then the tower of the new lottery-fuelled National Space Centre launches into view, rising above the factory roofs and the sodden banks of the River Soar like some giant prop from a 1950s sci-fi film. The very nearly completed building is glamorous in a Boy's Own, Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future, way. Unlike some other over-optimistic millennium museums and galleries in regional towns and cities, this one seems bound to draw the audience it needs to make it a success. The centre aims to attract no more than 300,000 visitors a year, mostly children on school trips, although it should do better than that. Why the confidence? First, because this is not just another museum dedicated to showing a few exhausted rockets and redundant satellites, but a live space centre, connected via the University of Leicester to real space exploration. Satellites will be controlled from here, and if all goes to plan, new equipment will be built in sight of visitors. This will include the Beagle-2 probe, a Martian explorer, due to be launched by the European \"Mars Express\" team in June 2003. Secondly, the education programme is one of the best around. In the Challenger learning centre, children get to work as astronauts and mission controllers in realistic simulations designed to tax their imagination as well as to help them understand the importance of teamwork. Thirdly, Nicholas Grimshaw's team of architects and engineers have designed one of the most distinctive and intriguing new buildings in Britain, one that everyone interested in buildings will want to see. You can't miss the tower. It's tall, a curious shape, shrouds a brace of spindly space rockets - and it's clad in what looks like a translucent version of the Puffa jacket. Set between curved steel frames, the tower's cladding is made up of a soft, jellyfish-like grid of what are essentially inflatable plastic pillows. The material is ETFE, a self-cleaning plastic, resistant to damage or discoloration from ultraviolet light. So in 20 years' time this eye-catching and revolutionary tower should look much as it does now. And if some guttersnipe decides to take a crack at the tower's inflatable skin with an air-rifle, the pellets will merely sink into the pillows, then pop back out again as the material regains its shape. The interior of the tower is reached via an elevated walkway inside the main body of the centre. This is a voluminous stainless-steel warehouse set low in what was the storm overflow tank of the old sewage and waterworks next door. This low-lying building contains, aside from shop and cafe, a small, superbly orchestrated \"space theatre\" or planetarium. Outside the building this appears in the guise of a Buckminster Fuller-like dome, a clever foil to the complex profile of the tower. The rest of this air-conditioned box of tricks is taken up by displays and exhibits, with pride of place given to a dusty-green Soyuz spacecraft. The upper walkway leads from the darkness of the main building into the light-filled tower, which can also be reached by two sci-fi pod lifts. The views down the shafts of the rockets, up to the old sputniks dangling from the apex of the roof, and through the inflated ETFE pillows across Leicester, are thrilling. From the top of the tower it's possible to see the project as a whole. Below, the buildings radiate out from the centre point of the dome of the space theatre, moving in a spiral out through the landscaped grounds and car park - and then, if you use your imagination, beyond the flatlands of Leicester and into infinity It's up to the city of Leicester, not the country's most romantic destination yet one of the hubs of the international space industry, to promote this new attraction imaginatively. Not only is the space age beginning to interest a new generation ignorant of Neil Armstrong, but Nicholas Grimshaw and his team have produced a building that will excite the imagination of both the children who queue to see the animatronic tyrannosaurus in the Natural History Museum, and those of us who believed that one day, some time around 2001, we'd be flying around the universe in sleek spacecraft. \u00b7 The National Space Centre, Leicester, opens on June 30.",

      "body": "<p>It's freezing cold. Professor Richard Lacey is standing outside the front door of his grand, dishevelled manor house. He's waiting for me, with a warm smile. The snow is falling off his purple pants and sloppy tie and haggard sports jacket. They could have been bought from Oxfam. He looks different from those pictures the papers were so fond of printing in the 90s. Older and healthier.</p> <p>Lacey became a household name 10 years ago when he warned the world against BSE and variant CJD. The government adviser announced that half the herds in Britain should be destroyed and, at very worst, the disease could wipe out a generation. This was at the time that the government was denying its existence. Lacey became the scourge of the very establishment he was a prominent member of. He was vilified by the politicians, the civil servants, the food industry, you name it. The very people who had called on his expertise denounced him as a self-publicising scaremonger.</p> <p>Late last year the Phillips report into BSE was released. By then, at least 80 people had died of vCJD in Britain. The politicians were duly criticised for their complacency and incompetence. If you search hard enough in one of the appendixes to the report you will also find a section that vindicates Lacey. Few newspapers bothered to report it.</p> <p>Lacey took early retirement a couple of years ago, at 58. These days he potters and paints, he gardens quite brilliantly, he makes a small fortune from his antiques collection. He does so many things, fills his time so easily and happily. He says he's not given a big interview for five years. Why should he? That's an old life, the past.</p> <p>When the Phillips report came out, he was on holiday in Switzerland. \"Fortunately, so I avoided the media.\" Why fortunately? \"Because I think I might have been tempted to say something that I might have regretted.\" Did he feel like gloating? \"No. It's not a happy situation. There are no winners. Throughout I hoped I would be wrong. You can't gloat. It would be like people investigating the effects on radiation gloating. You know, it's dreadful.\"</p> <p>Lacey is not vegetarian, but he stopped eating beef in 1988. His arguments were simple, and similar to those put forward by Tony Blair last week. By providing meat on the cheap we put our health at risk. \"When you have these massive scales of operation from animal feed to large numbers of animals being reared, to the abattoir, to the processing, to the purchase by the retailers and the sell, if you have a developing problem the infective agent would spread very quickly.\" He says exactly the same is true for foot and mouth today, and that until we have a return to small scale local production there will always be a chance of national catastrophe.</p> <p>The Tory government and its farming friends didn't like the message so they decided to destabilise the messenger. Lacey takes out a copy of one of his many books, and raises his vexed eyebrows into huge quotation marks. \"The thing I got really angry about was that a group of MPs used parliamentary privilege to rubbish me at a press conference in the House of Commons.\" He reads from the book slowly and calmly. \"This is what it said: 'That not all scientists bore equal authority was amply born out in our evidence. Professor Lacey in particular showed a tendency to extrapolate sensational conclusions from incomplete evidence in order to publicise his long-standing concerns about food safety. The result was a mixture of science and science fiction, a quite unsuitable basis for public policy. When he told us that if our worst fears are recognised we could virtually lose a generation of people he seemed to lose touch completely with the real world.' \" He stops, appalled. The first he heard of the smear campaign was when reporters rang him for a comment.</p> <p>But his conclusions were apocalyptic, weren't they? They did make for great headlines. \"No,\" he says. \"They sensationalised what I said, took it out of context. They didn't mention that I said it was a distinct possibility that no one was vulnerable. They deliberately focused on the worst-case scenario to discredit me.\"</p> <p>Lacey has lost four stone since the 90s, when he came across as a lumbering beast. He's rather svelte now. When he talks food politics he sits still and serious, clutching his ankles. Suddenly he asks if I would like to see his cacti, and he's transformed.</p> <p>He bounces off the sofa, and heads for the conservatory. He rushes over to a giant cactus, tells me it's an opuntia, and almost stabs himself with ants-in-the-pants enthusiasm. What does his love affair with cacti say about him? \"A bit prickly?\" He grins. \"Cacti are naturally immune to most pests, so they grow quite well.\"</p> <p>We're back in the lounge. He's clutching his ankles again, telling me how things went from bad to worse. Politicians suggested he wasn't qualified to talk about food because he was a professor of microbiology. He points to the mantelpiece. Alongside pictures of his two daughters and wife, there is a photo of Princess Diana presenting an award to him. \"It was quite extraordinary that they said that. In fact that was a prize in 1989, the Evian Health Award, for my work on salmonella.\"</p> <p>He says the government was well aware of his expertise. \"After all, they asked me to advise something called the veterinary products committee for four years from January 1 1986 to December 31 1989.\" He can be very pedantic when defending himself. Lacey has learned the importance of detail.</p> <p>He was also labelled a media tart. \"I never went to the press though. They always came to me. Like you have done today.\" The first time a newspaper approached him, about salmonella, he refused to comment. In the end, he thought someone had to say something about the dangers, and at least his department wasn't sponsored by the food industry. He thought he was safe. But he wasn't.</p> <p>Lacey seems a little restless. He asks me if I'd like to see jigsaws of the garden in bloom. He explains how he took photos, sent them to Scotland to be turned into 1,000-piece jigsaws, then spent a week making them and finally framed them. They are absolutely beautiful. At the end of the room there is row after row of vintage tea caddies. \"The oldest is about 1760. There's a secret drawer there for the caddy spoon. Go on, you'll never find it.\" He lets me struggle. \"D'you give in?\" I give in. He's delighted. He tells me how he restored many of the caddies himself. The house is crammed with stuff he's nurtured or created.</p> <p>Lacey is relaxed, and when he's relaxed he does tend to talk big. \"I tell you the governments aren't going to recover from this for centuries ,\" he says of the various food crises. \"They might be safe, but the trouble is you can't tell. And now any reassurance about GM foods will be dismissed.\" Lacey asks if he should put on his tie with the cows for the photograph.</p> <p>It was in 1994 that things reached their nadir. His department at Leeds University was 60% funded by the health service. One morning a health service manager turned up for a surprise visit. \"He said they were going to have a press conference in the afternoon, and they were going to announce all my staff's contracts would be transferred to another authority. It meant I couldn't do any work. I could be paid but do no work.\" The university, which remained loyal to him, worked out a package - the health service advanced his pension and agreed to reemploy him as a consultant in a small hospital for three years. \"The total cost to the health service was half a million pounds.\"</p> <p>But at least he was working as a consultant? \"In theory. But I only had about 10 minutes work to do a day.\" So they paid you 500 grand to lie down? \"Correct.\" He raises an eyebrow. \"Anyway it didn't work.\" In March 1996, the government finally admitted the link between BSE and vCJD. \"I was very prominent then, very vocal.\" When he finally retired in 1998, he was in for another shock. \"They cancelled the transfer of my staff's contracts, and that's how it is today. I think it was a deliberate conspiracy.\"</p> <p>Lacey says he was not a conspiracy theorist until BSE. In fact, he was what he calls a \"hereditary Tory\". He remembers his grandmother threatening to leave the country if Labour and the unions got into power. As an academic in the 80s he veered towards the Labour party because he believed his role was to challenge industry and society rather than appease it. These days, he says, he has given up on politics.</p> <p>How badly did the rubbishing affect him? \"Not really at all.\" Not at all? \"Well it did slightly. I suppose it changed my personality a bit. I think I became withdrawn. They tried to damage me, but I don't think they've actually succeeded. I think many people would have settled for my life, don't you?\"</p> <p>He takes down one of his prized tea caddies and tells me it's made of marine turtle. I ask him whether he's an obsessive collector. \"Yes, I am fairly obsessive,\" he says. \"I am very determined. I keep at things.\"</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd\" target=\"_new\">MAFF information and factsheets</a><br> <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/eur-   lex/en/lif/dat/1985/en_385L0511.html\" target=\"_new\">EU legislation on the disease</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk/info/f&amp;ml.asp\" target=\"_new\">Latest news from the NFU</a><br><a href=\"http://www.mlc.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Meat and livestock commission</a><br><a href=\"http://www.npa-uk.net\" target=\"_new\">National Pig Association</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.oie.int/eng/maladies/fiches/A_A010.HTM\" target=\"_new\">World organisation for animal health: foot and mouth disease</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Birds do it, bees do it, but a lot of British workers are just too exhausted to do it. Long working hours are leading to middle class professionals amongst others losing interest in their love lives, according to a survey released today. </p> <p>Over half the partners of workers questioned by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said their loved ones were so tired when they got home from work that their sex lives suffered. </p> <p>The survey also found that long hours led to mistakes at work, children being neglected, as well as physical and mental health complaints. </p> <p>Over one-fifth of people are working more than 48 hours a week, according to the survey - and 56% of these said the balance between their work and personal life was wrong, being weighted too much towards their job. </p> <p>Of those who work 48 hours a week or more, 35% described themselves as workaholics, with four in five of those being male. </p> <p>Three-quarters of those working long hours told interviewers the main reason was a large workload, with 47% saying it was their own choice and that they did not mind, while 43% reporting that they sometimes worked long hours grudgingly. </p> <p>Part of the survey reinterviewed people first spoken to two years ago, before the working time directive came into force to combat excessive working weeks. Britain has the longest average working week in the European Union: 43.6 hours. </p> <p>The report's author, Melissa Compton-Edwards, said: \"The working time directive is not having a great deal of impact. Of the people we interviewed two years ago, 60% are still working 48 hours a week or more; and just 2% reporting that their hours were reduced as a result of the working time directive. The rest are working fewer hours because they have changed jobs.\" </p> <p>Half of those interviewed blamed excessive hours for mistakes at work, with 5% saying they had been involved in car accidents as a result. </p> <p>\"Two-fifths report that working long hours has resulted in arguments with their spouse or partner .. Nearly a third admit that work-related tiredness is causing their sex life to suffer and 42% say that friendships have been damaged.\" </p> <p>Children also suffer, with 19% of workers saying long hours were causing damage to their relationships with their offspring, 22% saying they never saw their children before they went to bed, 34% saying they were so worn out they shouted at their children, and 29% experiencing guilt over missing seeing their offspring grow up. </p> <p>Middle managers are most likely to be spending the longest in the office. The main type of employee spending 48 hours at work is a manager or administrator (26%), or professional (24%), or artisan such as a craft worker (22%). But 28% of those working long hours are self-employed. </p> <p>Some 35% with long hours were aged 35-44, with 32% of those working over 48 hours aged 45-54. </p> <p>The group working most are those earning just below or above average earnings. </p> <p>John Monks, TUC general secretary, said: \"This long-hours culture is as bad for business as it is for people's home lives. </p> <p>\"Employers should realise that the happiest, most productive workers are those who have time to enjoy a life outside work.\" </p> <p>Ms Compton-Edwards said partners seem to accept an absentee and exhausted provider: \"The Faustian pact seems to be that while they would rather have their 'long hours' partner working shorter hours, this is considered a price worth paying if it guarantees a decent standard of living.\" </p> <p><strong>British disease</strong></p> <p>Self-reported health problems in past 12 months of people working 48 hours or more </p> <p>Mental exhaustion <strong>54%</strong> </p> <p>Difficulty sleeping <strong>43%</strong> </p> <p>Feeling unable to cope <strong>40%</strong> </p> <p>Chronic headaches <strong>23%</strong> </p> <p>Anxiety/depression <strong>19%</strong> </p> <p>Reduced sex drive <strong>14%</strong> </p> <p>Heart/blood problems <strong>12%</strong> </p> <p>Irritable bowel syndrome <strong>12%</strong> </p> <p>Ulcers <strong>5%</strong> </p> <p>Alcohol or drug problems <strong>2%</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Birds do it, bees do it, but a lot of British workers are just too exhausted to do it. Long working hours are leading to middle class professionals amongst others losing interest in their love lives, according to a survey released today. Over half the partners of workers questioned by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said their loved ones were so tired when they got home from work that their sex lives suffered. The survey also found that long hours led to mistakes at work, children being neglected, as well as physical and mental health complaints. Over one-fifth of people are working more than 48 hours a week, according to the survey - and 56% of these said the balance between their work and personal life was wrong, being weighted too much towards their job. Of those who work 48 hours a week or more, 35% described themselves as workaholics, with four in five of those being male. Three-quarters of those working long hours told interviewers the main reason was a large workload, with 47% saying it was their own choice and that they did not mind, while 43% reporting that they sometimes worked long hours grudgingly. Part of the survey reinterviewed people first spoken to two years ago, before the working time directive came into force to combat excessive working weeks. Britain has the longest average working week in the European Union: 43.6 hours. The report's author, Melissa Compton-Edwards, said: \"The working time directive is not having a great deal of impact. Of the people we interviewed two years ago, 60% are still working 48 hours a week or more; and just 2% reporting that their hours were reduced as a result of the working time directive. The rest are working fewer hours because they have changed jobs.\" Half of those interviewed blamed excessive hours for mistakes at work, with 5% saying they had been involved in car accidents as a result. \"Two-fifths report that working long hours has resulted in arguments with their spouse or partner .. Nearly a third admit that work-related tiredness is causing their sex life to suffer and 42% say that friendships have been damaged.\" Children also suffer, with 19% of workers saying long hours were causing damage to their relationships with their offspring, 22% saying they never saw their children before they went to bed, 34% saying they were so worn out they shouted at their children, and 29% experiencing guilt over missing seeing their offspring grow up. Middle managers are most likely to be spending the longest in the office. The main type of employee spending 48 hours at work is a manager or administrator (26%), or professional (24%), or artisan such as a craft worker (22%). But 28% of those working long hours are self-employed. Some 35% with long hours were aged 35-44, with 32% of those working over 48 hours aged 45-54. The group working most are those earning just below or above average earnings. John Monks, TUC general secretary, said: \"This long-hours culture is as bad for business as it is for people's home lives. \"Employers should realise that the happiest, most productive workers are those who have time to enjoy a life outside work.\" Ms Compton-Edwards said partners seem to accept an absentee and exhausted provider: \"The Faustian pact seems to be that while they would rather have their 'long hours' partner working shorter hours, this is considered a price worth paying if it guarantees a decent standard of living.\" British disease Self-reported health problems in past 12 months of people working 48 hours or more Mental exhaustion 54% Difficulty sleeping 43% Feeling unable to cope 40% Chronic headaches 23% Anxiety/depression 19% Reduced sex drive 14% Heart/blood problems 12% Irritable bowel syndrome 12% Ulcers 5% Alcohol or drug problems 2%",

She's as beautiful as Garbo, acts as well as Vanessa Redgrave, dresses in such a way as to make Liz Hurley look staid - and on top of that, she has an opulent, sexy voice that sends shivers down your spine. Her Barbican recital was greeted with a response that can only be described as abandoned, as she turned her audience into a rout of orgiastic devotees worshipping at her shrine. </p> <p>She swept on to the platform draped in a glittering gold cape, from which she disrobed part way through the first half to reveal a skimpy black trousersuit - at which point a shuddering gasp ran round the building. After the interval she returned in a green gown open from throat to midriff and slashed from crotch to ankle. At that point, audience restraint was thrown to the winds, as enthusiastic roars, shrieks and yells erupted. The wildness continued to the end of the evening. </p> <p>Her programme was idiosyncratic and tremendous, opening and closing with some rarely performed material written in languages other than the composers' own. </p> <p>Schubert's Italian songs were balanced by a curious group of early Wagner efforts in French. Each group culminated in a portrayal of a tragic heroine in extremis. Schubert's Dido implored Aeneas not to abandon her with a mixture of manipulative wheedling and awesome rage - Mattila, obsessively wringing her hands, suggested a woman whose nerves were passing beyond breaking point. Wagner's Les Adieux de Marie Stuart ostensibly depicts the Queen of Scots saying farewell to France, though in the process, Wagner endows her with prophetic fits that allow her intimations of her future disastrous career. Musically it owes much to Meyerbeer, against whom Wagner later turned vituperatively, though its extravagantly surging vocal line also presages Isolde's erotics and Br\u00fcnnhilde's sacrificial immolation. Mattila unleashed a swirling torrent of elation, rapture and despair while the audience held its breath. </p> <p>In between came contemporary Finnish music and songs by Henri Duparc. Jouni Kaipainen's Runopolku (The Poetic Path) is a ravishing, surreal song cycle that balances impressionistic pianism with declamatory, expressionistic vocals. Mattila proved that she can sing contemporary music as well as she can sing anything else. In Duparc's songs, she became a languid icon of Baudelairean sensuality - \" luxe, calme et volupt\u00e9 \" incarnate.

      "bodyText": "If you've got it, flaunt it, so they say. Soprano Karita Mattila certainly does. The \"Finnish Venus\", as she's known, is a phenomenon. She's as beautiful as Garbo, acts as well as Vanessa Redgrave, dresses in such a way as to make Liz Hurley look staid - and on top of that, she has an opulent, sexy voice that sends shivers down your spine. Her Barbican recital was greeted with a response that can only be described as abandoned, as she turned her audience into a rout of orgiastic devotees worshipping at her shrine. She swept on to the platform draped in a glittering gold cape, from which she disrobed part way through the first half to reveal a skimpy black trousersuit - at which point a shuddering gasp ran round the building. After the interval she returned in a green gown open from throat to midriff and slashed from crotch to ankle. At that point, audience restraint was thrown to the winds, as enthusiastic roars, shrieks and yells erupted. The wildness continued to the end of the evening. Her programme was idiosyncratic and tremendous, opening and closing with some rarely performed material written in languages other than the composers' own. Schubert's Italian songs were balanced by a curious group of early Wagner efforts in French. Each group culminated in a portrayal of a tragic heroine in extremis. Schubert's Dido implored Aeneas not to abandon her with a mixture of manipulative wheedling and awesome rage - Mattila, obsessively wringing her hands, suggested a woman whose nerves were passing beyond breaking point. Wagner's Les Adieux de Marie Stuart ostensibly depicts the Queen of Scots saying farewell to France, though in the process, Wagner endows her with prophetic fits that allow her intimations of her future disastrous career. Musically it owes much to Meyerbeer, against whom Wagner later turned vituperatively, though its extravagantly surging vocal line also presages Isolde's erotics and Br\u00fcnnhilde's sacrificial immolation. Mattila unleashed a swirling torrent of elation, rapture and despair while the audience held its breath. In between came contemporary Finnish music and songs by Henri Duparc. Jouni Kaipainen's Runopolku (The Poetic Path) is a ravishing, surreal song cycle that balances impressionistic pianism with declamatory, expressionistic vocals. Mattila proved that she can sing contemporary music as well as she can sing anything else. In Duparc's songs, she became a languid icon of Baudelairean sensuality - \" luxe, calme et volupt\u00e9 \" incarnate. The sexual charge Mattila generates is astonishing, and she ranks, without question, as the successor of the legendary vocal eroticists of the last century - singers such as Maria Jeritza, Ljuba Welitsch and Leonie Rysanek. At the piano, Malcolm Martineau, excellent as always, looked as if he wondered what had hit him. Everyone in the audience felt the same way.",

If we were, surely we would have been born with washable, plush velour covers, neat little antimacassars in place of shoulders, and dainty brass casters for feet. Despite these obvious design flaws, the average British office worker spends 25 to 40 hours a week stagnating in front of a computer screen, chin thrust out and shoulders grazing ear lobes. The fact that back pain is the nation's leading disability is therefore hardly staggering. </p> <p>According to BackCare, a UK charity that provides information for back pain sufferers, it is a problem that affects nearly two-thirds of UK adults, and loses British industry around \u00a36bn a year through days spent off work. The average sufferer takes 13 days off, and one in eight unemployed people cite back pain as their reason for not working. Goodness only knows how many valuable hours are lost in moaning to your colleagues about the huge knot in your shoulder, and audibly cracking your neck in between telephone calls. </p> <p>A report last month from the NHS centre for reviews and dissemination at York University, concluded that there is little we can do to help a bad back, other than swallow painkillers. But because many cases are attributable to our slouching postures, our sedentary professions, and our couch-lovin' lifestyles, there are a few simple measures that might help. </p> <p>Caroline Murison, from the West End Physiotherapy Clinic in London, runs a service called the Nine to Five Check. A physiotherapist visits your office and spends 20 minutes assessing your posture at your workstation before instructing you in basic exercises - which you can do at your desk - to help prevent back pain. You don't even have to put on your trainers. </p> <p>The first thing to look at is your chair. By law, says Emma Tate from BackCare, there is a minimum standard to which the chair must conform. \"It must be stable, which means having a base with five legs in a star-shape; the seat should be adjustable in height and tilt, and it needs to allow freedom of movement\". </p> <p>The way in which you sit in your chair will obviously affect your back. Right now, I'm leaning slightly to the right, my middle back slouched and my legs crossed. This is wrong, and on no account should you try this at home. The spinal position we should be aiming for is a gentle S-shape - \"Not upright, but not slouching,\" says Tate. Murison recommends that your knees be at a 90 degree angle to your body, with your feet flat on the floor. </p> <p>\"People who sit down all day tend to experience low back strain from sitting hunched forwards,\" explains Liz Ellis, president of the British Osteopathic Society. \"This puts strain on the ligaments. You're putting a lot of pressure on the front of the discs, they bulge backwards and trap the nerves, which leads to referred pain going down the back of the leg.\" To stop yourself slumping forwards, Ellis advises that you \"sit on the two bottom bones, not on the fleshy bit of your bottom\". Those of you who are concerned that there is only a fleshy bit of your bottom may join the club. </p> <p>Once she's got your chair sorted, Murison looks at the position of your computer, the keyboard, and the mouse. \"A lot of people have their mouse too far away, they keep their wrist extended, and their wrist and finger cocked, which can lead to repetitive strain injury,\" she says. </p> <p>It doesn't end there. Ellis explains that a host of problems can be caused simply by sitting a little cockeyed on your swivel chair: \"Because they're not sitting straight, people tend to poke their chins forward, and so they get chronic tension in the muscles at the back of the neck and across the shoulders. The weight of the human head is enormous, and if you let the head poke forward, this affects the joints at the point where the neck meets the top of the spine and can alter how the vertebrae sit at the top of the neck, leading to headaches. </p> <p>In addition, because people are hunched forwards, like little goblins, they find that they clench their teeth, which can bring trigeminal neuralgia and general facial pain. Sitting with legs crossed can cause haemorrhoids, varicose veins and circulatory problems, and inhibits good breathing and digestion. It's a whole body thing.\" </p> <p>The there's the telephone. We all know what it's like trying to answer calls, switch on the computer and open the post at the same time, but Murison explains that the way we use the phone can also lead to back problems. \"People tend to hook the handset under one ear, which is really bad for the neck,\" she says. \"We recommend using headsets, or moving the phone from one side to another.\" Emma Tate suggests you try standing up for every other telephone call. </p> <p>The predominant advice is simply to keep moving. \"We're not made like machines or robots,\" Tate observes. \"We need to take breaks.\" Every 15-20 minutes you should try to move around, change position, fidget a bit, maybe take a stroll to the water-cooler. \"Do some exercises at your desk,\" suggests Tate, \"go outside at lunchtime, whatever the weather. Walk upstairs instead of taking the lift.\" </p> <p>Outside office hours (what? you mean there is life beyond Office Hours?), you should try to get a bit of gentle exercise, too. \"Don't just go home, sit on your comfy sofa and watch TV,\" Murison says sternly. \"We advise people to do stretching exercises. A lot of people go to the gym to try and tone up, but they need to remember to stretch when they warm up and cool down.\" There's some science behind it, too, Liz Ellis explains. \"Unless people do some kind of body maintenance, they tend to have very lax abdominal muscles. Tense abdominals take the pressure off the back muscles. I recommend that my patients find a properly trained pilates teacher, and be mindful of their posture every day, tucking in your tail and holding in you abdominal muscles, rather than doing exercise twice a week.\" </p> <p>BackCare recommends pretty much everything you can think of - stretching, swimming, walking, yoga, Alexander Technique, tai chi, exercise bicycles with upright handlebars . . .

You can now sneak a peek at the celebrity content created for that ill-fated site at countingdown.com, where two cartoon curiosities are currently on show. The 'Steven' of Steven's Dream is Mr Spielberg himself, who narrates his own real-life dream of an insatiable eating episode, translated into agreeably rough-edged animation. Watching Steven demolish the buffet, you can't help but notice that the dreams of cinema's golden boy are just as banal as our own - it's a forbidden food fantasy, common to dieters the world over.

So we went to check out Paulo Machline's sweetly nostalgic retelling of a schoolboy soccer match in 1950s Brazil, the only other Web-hosted short in the competition. Nominated for Best Live Action Short, A Soccer Story has the classy looks and heart-warming traits (period setting, plucky kids, uplifting surprise ending) that traditionally warm the Academy's cockles. A serious contender, in fact. Try and view it using a broadband or ISDN line, since it's in Portuguese with English subtitles, which are illegible via a 56k modem.

      "bodyText": "Steven's Dream (www.countingdown.com) Last autumn, DreamWorks SKG tiptoed away from Pop.com, their webfilm venture which was abandoned pre-launch. You can now sneak a peek at the celebrity content created for that ill-fated site at countingdown.com, where two cartoon curiosities are currently on show. The 'Steven' of Steven's Dream is Mr Spielberg himself, who narrates his own real-life dream of an insatiable eating episode, translated into agreeably rough-edged animation. Watching Steven demolish the buffet, you can't help but notice that the dreams of cinema's golden boy are just as banal as our own - it's a forbidden food fantasy, common to dieters the world over. Get out your Penguin Freud, however, to appreciate the meaning of his final morsel. (KS) \u0095 View the film A Soccer Story (www.ifilm.com) Can we pick 'em or what?

The in-your-face up-front rudeness of the imagery is balanced by a bitterly ironic text: \"Vulva recognises the symbols and names on graffiti under the railroad: slit, snatch, enchilada, beaver, muff, coozie, fish and finger pie . . .
