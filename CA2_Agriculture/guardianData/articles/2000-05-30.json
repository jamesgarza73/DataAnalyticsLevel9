Stewart's is as good as it gets. </p> <p>\"I wondered how long Alec would manage to combine the jobs but it didn't seem to affect him,\" Flower said. Once the series is over, he will seek him out and, this being cricket, insights will be shared. </p> <p>There was some advice, though, to be going along with. \"As long as you separate out the job of captaincy and concentrate on your keeping, then there is not a problem,\" Stewart said. \"It is important to focus on your wicketkeeping because it is such a vital component in the field. The keeper is the centre of attention. If you have a good game, it lifts everybody. Have a bad half-hour and it can feed through. </p> <p>\"Andy is a top-class cricketer and his record with the bat while captain has been very good. It is important to lean on your vice-captain a lot, by asking him to translate messages or check fielding angles. </p> <p>\"They said that Andy dropped two easy catches at Lord's. But the edge from Mark Ramprakash was not as straightforward as it looked. The ball can snake and wobble around after it bounces; this one definitely dipped on him.\" </p> <p>Stewart is a cricketing obsessive. It would be virtually impossible to exhaust him if he was asked to operate the PA system and supply the catering. He must be unbearable on holiday, asking his two kids for a knock-up within minutes of arriving on the beach. If Flower proves incapable of combining both jobs in the long term, it would not be an offence against nature. </p> <p>Meanwhile, encouraged by his 100 at Lord's and by the central contracts system that will allow him to devise his own fitness and recuperation regimes away from the demands of county cricket, Stewart feels so sparky that he is even daring to wonder whether he might still be around for the next World Cup in South Africa in three years' time. </p> <p>\"It is not how old you are, it is how you are playing that counts,\" he said. \"I've played solid cricket since 1981 and it has never crossed my mind to take a winter off.\"</p>",

But often this peripheral business is just confusing.

While the fund management unit bought by Commerzbank bank in 1995 would do little other than to confirm the departure of the chief executive, industry sources believe that any many as nine of the 12 board members of Jupiter were also leaving. </p> <p>Commerzbank yesterday put in place a new executive committee to run the Jupiter operation, naming Edward Bonham Carter, the brother of actress Helena, and Jonathan Carey as joint chief executives. </p> <p>Alan Miller, the head of specialist funds, and Martin Schueller, the head of interna tional business development, were named as the remaining two members of the fund manager's executive committee. </p> <p>The departure of Mr Duffield follows negotiations about the new structure of the operation after Commerzbank took full ownership of the business in April - when it paid \u00a3500m for the remaining 25% owned by the Jupiter fund managers. Mr Duffield was said to have made \u00a3175m from that sale. </p> <p>Mr Glynn stressed that no fund managers had left the business. It was unclear whether Mr Duffield, who is believed to be in his 60s, in tended to set up a rival operation or whether he would receive any pay-off from the German bank. </p> <p>Perpetual, one of Jupiter's closest rivals, last night said it was \"by no means\" certain it would end up being put on the market after appointing Merrill Lynch and Cazenove to advise it on its \"strategic options\". </p> <p>Amvescap, the largest fund management group listed on the stock market, is thought to still be interested in the operation but had been knocked out of negotiations, which were never confirmed, after buying Trimark of Canada. </p> <p>Roger Cornick, the deputy chairman of Perpetual, said the operation, 45% controlled by founder Martin Arbib and his family, remained in takeover negotiations. </p> <p>However, he indicated that the process was likely to take \"months rather than weeks\" and may not even result in the sale of the business. \"A strategic review means just that,\" Mr Cornick said. </p> <p>The shares rose by \u00a31 to \u00a338.50, but remained well below the \u00a345 a share many industry sources believe Mr Arbib hopes to receive for the business he founded and which grew on the back of the personal equity plan industry.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Commerzbank was last night locked in bonus and pay negotiations with its senior Jupiter fund managers after the sudden departure of John Duffield, the high profile chief executive of the fund management operation. Steve Glynn, the head of retail marketing at Jupiter, said conversations had just begun about \"incentivising and motivating\" important fund managers in order to prevent any mass departures from the business, which manages funds of some \u00a314bn for thousands of small investors and major institutions. While the fund management unit bought by Commerzbank bank in 1995 would do little other than to confirm the departure of the chief executive, industry sources believe that any many as nine of the 12 board members of Jupiter were also leaving. Commerzbank yesterday put in place a new executive committee to run the Jupiter operation, naming Edward Bonham Carter, the brother of actress Helena, and Jonathan Carey as joint chief executives. Alan Miller, the head of specialist funds, and Martin Schueller, the head of interna tional business development, were named as the remaining two members of the fund manager's executive committee. The departure of Mr Duffield follows negotiations about the new structure of the operation after Commerzbank took full ownership of the business in April - when it paid \u00a3500m for the remaining 25% owned by the Jupiter fund managers. Mr Duffield was said to have made \u00a3175m from that sale. Mr Glynn stressed that no fund managers had left the business. It was unclear whether Mr Duffield, who is believed to be in his 60s, in tended to set up a rival operation or whether he would receive any pay-off from the German bank. Perpetual, one of Jupiter's closest rivals, last night said it was \"by no means\" certain it would end up being put on the market after appointing Merrill Lynch and Cazenove to advise it on its \"strategic options\". Amvescap, the largest fund management group listed on the stock market, is thought to still be interested in the operation but had been knocked out of negotiations, which were never confirmed, after buying Trimark of Canada. Roger Cornick, the deputy chairman of Perpetual, said the operation, 45% controlled by founder Martin Arbib and his family, remained in takeover negotiations. However, he indicated that the process was likely to take \"months rather than weeks\" and may not even result in the sale of the business. \"A strategic review means just that,\" Mr Cornick said. The shares rose by \u00a31 to \u00a338.50, but remained well below the \u00a345 a share many industry sources believe Mr Arbib hopes to receive for the business he founded and which grew on the back of the personal equity plan industry.",

Share options, two mobile phones, free travel to work and a fat pension are all hers for the taking, together with special deals on cars, televisions, hi-fi equipment, sports clubs, food outlets and clothes shops. But Evans, 29, isn't working at the pulsating hub of the new economy, or doing something lucrative, incomprehensible and soul-destroying in a merchant bank. She is a secretary in a moderately sized home counties market town. And her 3,500-plus fellow employees all get similar privileges. </p> <p>This isn't some thinktank's idea of utopia. And whatever Evans's employer, Vodafone, might say, it's not really generosity, either: even the market leader has to keep an eye out for the next set of head-frying rumours or a vertiginous plunge in tech stocks, and generosity doesn't come cheap. There is a far more hard-headed reason: full employment. This is Newbury in Berkshire, home of the lowest unemployment rate in the country: 1%, compared to a national average of 4% and a high in South Tyneside and Haringey in London of 12.3%. Only Basingstoke in Hampshire - and some small tourist resorts during the high season - can match it. </p> <p>For most economists, Newbury's rate counts as full employment - and even with the muscle that comes from being the biggest employer in town, Vodafone clearly figures some sweeteners are necessary just to hang on to the workers they already have, never mind the 100-plus Newbury-based vacancies on their books at any one time. Staff who recruit friends to fill empty positions can claim bonuses of between \u00a3200 and \u00a32,000, depending on the seniority of the job. Some of the perks are available at the company's other UK sites, but nowhere are they more essential than in Newbury. \"We run into brick walls,\" says Mike Caldwell, Vodafone's head of corporate communications, \"where we've just employed all of the secretaries, all of the drivers, or whatever, that there are in the area.\" </p> <p>A little further down the food chain, employers are even more desperate to seduce the limited workforce. Every other shop advertises multiple vacancies, while such recruitment agencies as manage to scrape a living cram their windows with ads for temporary data inputters and filing clerks subtly reworded to make them sound like once-in-a-lifetime career opportunities. Acres of classifieds in the Newbury Weekly News offer cleaning and shelf-stack ing jobs at twice the minimum wage and beyond. </p> <p>\"You've got two types of people in Newbury,\" says Debbie Twyning, manager of the Fabric Land store in the town centre, who is currently struggling to fill two positions. \"Those who are in jobs - and those who don't want them.\" It is, without doubt, the employees who call the shots in Newbury. But they call them in a way that might surprise some traditional economists. </p> <p>Certainly, Newbury's exceptional circumstances turn the usual experience of wage-slavery on its head. The job search is viewed as a bizarre and alien ritual: leaving her last job, Evans took one day off work to fire off applications and had a sheaf of offers - two from the same company - within a week. </p> <p>Her colleague, Michelle Burgess, 23, didn't even make it that far: she was scooped up by Vodafone straight from sixth form and sponsored through university to a job at the other end. </p> <p>\"It's a nightmare,\" says Pauline Evans, managing director of Profile Recruitment, in the morgue-like silence of her agency's office. Companies hold bidding wars for temporary staff; permanent admin posts for moderately skilled second-jobbers kick off at \u00a313,000. \"Between four and five o'clock yesterday we took orders for 13 temporary staff. We filled two. The people just are not there.\" </p> <p>But not everything is working the way economic theory suggests it should. Workers in areas of full employment are supposed to be hawkish, fickle creatures, flitting from job to job in search of higher salaries or better perks. Turnover should be high, and wages should be spiralling as workers holding all the cards bargain with eager-to-please employers. But it's not turning out that way. </p> <p>For a start, loyalty - supposedly a key casualty of full employment and the knowledge economy alike - isn't dead. Talk to just about any Newbury employee and the responses are the same: security and satisfaction, an employer's reputation and the workplace culture rate far higher than minor increases in pay. </p> <p>\"Money's the least of it for me,\" is one typical comment. \"Enjoying the job is what matters. And 95% of my job is enjoyable. Money's just a bonus on top.\" According to Thames Valley Enterprise, wages are increasing at around 7% annually - the national average is not much lower, at around 5% - and turnover in jobs is not exceptionally high; at Vodafone it is only around 8%. Caldwell hasn't had a leaving do in his department for five years. </p> <p>Another surprisingly beleaguered resident of this paradise on earth is Gordon Bull, principal of Newbury College, the local further and adult education provider. Of all people, his role - feeding a ravenous job market - should be a cinch. But quite apart from his own staff retention woes, Bull has another worry. His younger, full-time students - especially those training in the technology sector - keep getting lured off their courses and into jobs. \"There's a huge temptation to give up studies and go and get a job,\" says Bull, sipping coffee in his office and frowning. \"My worry is that while that might make them happy now, what will it mean for their futures? There's an enormous pressure, and some of the local employers do try to tempt the good ones away.\" </p> <p>And while it might elicit little sympathy in South Tyneside or Haringey, there's a further concern: the agony of choice. \"Students are faced with a huge amount of options,\" Bull says. \"It's not a question of what's on offer - there's a huge amount on offer - it's a question of what people should go for.

There will, of course, be others - the unemployed not registered as such - yet the Jobcentre's near-emptiness is still something of a social triumph. </p> <p>But economics may, after all, have the last laugh: this glorious state of affairs may not last forever. The real problem with full employment, critics argue, is that it impedes competitiveness and obstructs growth; while Vodafone is here for the duration, other companies may eventually give up and move away, shedding local jobs.

Stygian in both portent and outcome, it was, nevertheless, illuminated at regular intervals by the appearance of an optimistic beacon of luminous good cheer in the shape and dazzle of the visiting coach's hairdo. </p> <p>It could only be Thommo. </p> <p>Once the most feared and famed of fast bowlers, the Australian Jeff Thomson is a peripatetic cricketing nomad dispensing solid technical sense and earthy four-lettered wisdom to any player or team in need of a lift either spiritual or temporal. And up on that Lord's balcony last week, for crestfallen Zimbabwe, their assistant coach's great busby of a coiffure confidently glowed not so much a silver lining but one of leonine orangey-gold. If any team needs some colourful good cheer it is Zimbabwe and Thomson takes them to Trent Bridge today thoroughly determined to help them put Lord's behind them. </p> <p>\"There are a heap of lessons to be learned from Lord's,\" says Thomson, \"and a heap of pride to be restored. I'm just praying we're mentally tough enough to come back after such a thrashing. Sure, we know we lack strength in depth but do we also lack strength of will, mental discipline and application? We're going to find out this week at Nottingham, aren't we?\" </p> <p>He will not find an excuse in Zimbabwe's political turmoils at home. Nor, as cricketing mentor, should he. But it is hard for a neutral to dismiss them. A year ago these same tourists were strutting, keen and slickly athletic, through the early rounds of the World Cup. Twelve months on and they have not displayed any of that bright-eyed readiness for battle; all 1999's dagger-sharpness in the field is sadly blunt and careworn. Those broad shoulders are hunched and rounded now, the competitive edge all ragged. Since arriving this time, they have looked wary and worried, fretful for home. And no wonder. </p> <p>Zimbabwe cricket is strapped for cash. Thomson boosts his coach's wages with journalism and broadcasting - and his style is as directly unsettling as his toe-crunching yorker used to be. The day after Zimbabwe's Lord's surrender his poor team must have cringed doubly on reading their coach's slating censure in his column in London's Evening Standard. As intros go, this was pure Thommo. </p> <p>\"We lost the toss, lost three wickets for nothing before I'd blinked, lost the plot with the rest of the batting, lost any chance to put England under a bit of pressure through not supporting Heath Streak, lost two TV replay decisions and eventually lost by an innings and more than I care to remember. I think the only thing we didn't lose was our way back to the hotel each evening,\" he wrote. </p> <p>In fact, as senior bowling coach only recently introduced to his charges, Thomson has no reason to upbraid himself. The burly Streak was simply terrific at Lord's and the tenderfoot Pommie Mbangwa showed willing promise (Mbangwa's 10-wicket haul against Yorkshire's stiffs this weekend has further fired his potential). But the catching and wicket-keeping was dire, and the batting flaccid. With the luck of the toss Zimbabwe's bowlers could cash in at Nottingham. \"Sure,\" Thomson says, \"but even then our batsmen have to make at least 350 in their first knock for us to be remotely competitive.\" It must be a strain for a merciless old Pommie basher to be back over here in the also-rans frame. </p> <p>The last time Thomson played a test at Trent Bridge was in 1977 - Geoffrey Boycott's \"comeback\" test and Ian Botham's auspicious first - and, when he came into bat at No10 just before tea on the first day and in the middle of Beefy's first \"five-for\", he was greeted with noisy acclaim from the rafters. Announced all over Fleet Street's back pages that morning had been his \"heroic\", \"noble\", \"honourable\" decision not to take Kerry Packer's upcoming sackfuls of shillings. </p> <p>For a brief period English cricket had thought that Packer was being thwarted at last by an upright moral crusader - until the truth emerged a few weeks later that it was Thommo's employers at the time, Queensland radio station 4IP, who were refusing to let him work, even in a fast-bowling capacity, for a deadly media rival from Sydney. Still, for those few days at Nottingham, the sudden darling of the English establishment bathed warmly in the unlikely approbation, bowled very fast and took three good wickets. </p> <p>In 1981 Thommo briefly joined Middlesex and few in England can have bowled more venomously quick. It was fascinating to hear on Test Match Special in one of the many breaks for rain at Lord's earlier this month the recall of Vic Marks and our own Mike Selvey of a Lord's morning that June 6 when Somerset's Viv Richards smouldered in to take on the terrifyingly fast Thomson. Blast and withering counter-blast for an hour or so, it was, by both accounts, a truly epic and breathtaking contest, a championship rumble, a cricketing Ali v Frazier. </p> <p>Thomson toured England again in 1985 and he took the wickets he needed to post his 200 for all Tests and his 100th v England. The double century had cost this utterly dynamic, uncomplicated cricketer just 28 runs each. In all, he took 675 wickets at 26. </p> <p>He retired, he said, to fish and surf, \"to enjoy the bush and the ocean\" - and, when he got restless, \"perhaps a bit of coaching here and there\". Which is why, nearing 50, he and his luminous beacon of a hairdo is back at Trent Bridge. \"Only hard work can put matters right for Zim - and there isn't long till Thursday.\"</p>",

It was fascinating to hear on Test Match Special in one of the many breaks for rain at Lord's earlier this month the recall of Vic Marks and our own Mike Selvey of a Lord's morning that June 6 when Somerset's Viv Richards smouldered in to take on the terrifyingly fast Thomson. Blast and withering counter-blast for an hour or so, it was, by both accounts, a truly epic and breathtaking contest, a championship rumble, a cricketing Ali v Frazier. Thomson toured England again in 1985 and he took the wickets he needed to post his 200 for all Tests and his 100th v England. The double century had cost this utterly dynamic, uncomplicated cricketer just 28 runs each. In all, he took 675 wickets at 26. He retired, he said, to fish and surf, \"to enjoy the bush and the ocean\" - and, when he got restless, \"perhaps a bit of coaching here and there\". Which is why, nearing 50, he and his luminous beacon of a hairdo is back at Trent Bridge. \"Only hard work can put matters right for Zim - and there isn't long till Thursday.\"",

Lancashire, set 221 and fortunate to fall 15 runs short, were well beaten. </p> <p>Gloucestershire's determination was exemplified by Rob Cunliffe, who was chosen only half-an-hour before the start because of injury to Ian Harvey. He battled gamely for 71 from 113 balls, and needed a hospital x-ray on a bruised toe after being hit twice by Andy Flintoff. \"It's not broken, so I should be fit for Lord's,\" Cunliffe said. </p> <p>His county have been short of top-order runs all season but their one-day confidence remained undimmed, and in Cunliffe they had a batsman whose peculiar career summed up their predilections. His Benson&amp;Hedges average, at more than 50, is twice his record in the championship. </p> <p>Tim Hancock began blisteringly, then fell leg-glancing, magnificently snapped up by Warren Hegg; Matt Windows busied himself in mid-innings and Alleyne's 32 from 28 balls provided late impetus. </p> <p>For one Lancastrian, defeat seemed unthinkable. Neil Fairbrother had never lost a semi-final in a 19-year career and needed only one more Lord's appearance to surpass the record of 10 finals he shares with Kent's Derek Underwood. </p> <p>It was Fairbrother's 74, from 102 balls, which kept Lancashire vaguely in touch. He began cagily, entering at 19 for three. A bail fell off as he scored his first run but replays showed it was only the wind. With Michael Atherton labouring for 79 balls over 27, runs were scarce. </p> <p>Fairbrother needed a runner for the second half of his innings after straining a calf. With 58 needed in less than five overs, he swung Jon Lewis to Windows at long-on and, despite one or two late bowling tremors from Jamie Averis, the match was won. </p> <p>On a pitch that restricted stroke play, Gloucestershire's 220 for six was a decent total; the new-ball pair of Lewis and Mike Smith, by removing Mike Watkinson, John Crawley and Andy Flintoff within 10 overs, made it formidable. </p> <p>This is a distinct new-ball pairing, and not just in terms of left-arm and right-arm. Smith, who took two wickets in the final over to finish with four for 27, bowled his inswing with serenity, curving one back to hit Crawley's leg stump and causing Flintoff to drag on, pulling. Lewis The Lip rarely delivers a ball without effing and blinding, presumably to disguise the fact that he rarely gets it above 80mph. </p> <p>Watkinson, bowled through the gate, was Lewis's victim. Now Lancashire's second XI coach, \"Winker\" made his first appearance of the season, at 38, in a semi-final. This provided the chance to study a bowling action that mutates annually. He is currently in his Armpit Period, in which he seems to tear out a chunk of body hair while delivering the ball. Long before the end, all Lancashire was tearing its hair out.</p>",

Now Lancashire's second XI coach, \"Winker\" made his first appearance of the season, at 38, in a semi-final. This provided the chance to study a bowling action that mutates annually. He is currently in his Armpit Period, in which he seems to tear out a chunk of body hair while delivering the ball. Long before the end, all Lancashire was tearing its hair out.",

Barthez has been granted special leave from France's Euro 2000 preparations to finalise a move to Old Trafford that would make him the most expensive goalkeeper in British football while underlining the doubts over Mark Bosnich's future. Ferguson spent several hours in negotiations with Barthez and his advisers last night and the early indications point to the 28-year-old signing a six-year contract within the next 48 hours. \"It's true to say that discussions are ongoing with the player,\" said United's spokesman Ken Ramsden. \"Nothing has been decided yet but we hope to make progress on Tuesday.\" Less than a fortnight has passed since Barthez publicly stated his desire to stay at Monaco, but the lure of joining the world's richest club has apparently been too great for a player whose curriculum vitae already boasts a World Cup winner's medal. Ferguson has been monitoring his situation ever since it became apparent that Massimo Taibi's career at Old Trafford was destined only for a place in the club's hall of infamy. The United manager has had little in the way of positive feedback in the past month, with reports in Monaco stating that Barcelona had been prime movers in attempting to entice Barthez away from the principality. But United are willing to meet Monaco's asking price of some 100m francs and it is highly improbable that Barthez will leave Old Trafford without having negotiated a deal second only to Roy Keane's.

Sadly he only had time to address a selection of the questions that poured in; what follows is an edited transcript of the questions that Ben was able to answer</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>naomi2 </strong><br> Stand-up comedy, scriptwriter, novelist, playwright, film director. Which do you enjoy most and which do you think you're best at? </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> Everything I do is based on the scripts I write. So first and foremost I'm a writer. But directing your own film script is the best way to be a writer because you get to write in three dimensions. </p> <p><strong>Idlewriter</strong><br> As a performer myself I was wondering how you found the enthusiasm to deliver your set when you're on a long tour. Is it hard not to just \"go through the motions\"? and, If there was one piece of advice you could give a new comic what would it be? </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> I would advise you not to be idle. the only way to write good gags is to work very hard at it. Your first good idea just occurs to you. Every other idea has to be dragged screaming from somewhere inside. </p> <p><strong>Tally43 </strong><br> Dear Ben, Why have you stopped doing 'political comedy'? Why has everyone pretty much stopped doing it? do you think your Thatcher bashing in the 80s made any difference - or was she and her government just an easy target and an easy laugh? Do you think comedians have a duty to raise the public's awareness of 'issues' or are they just there to amuse? . PS be honest... don't you miss her just a little bit? </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> I do not miss Thatch in the slightest and yes, she was a very easy target for a comedian, but not for many disadvantaged people. I never did political comedy for the sake of it, I just wrote what I felt then, as I do now. If I was on live TV weekly, as I was with Saturday Live, I'm sure I would draw on the issues of the day just as I did then, although I would say that we live in considerably less edgy and confrontational times than when I started out as a comedian. Mrs Thatcher's greatest achievement was to shatter the Liberal Left post-war consensus in our society and replace it with a Liberal Right consensus. That happened in the 80s and they were tough times. (PS By greatest I mean biggest not best.) I do not think comedians or any artists have a duty to do anything other than express themselves to the best of their abilities. But sometimes 'issues' can be very amusing. </p> <p><strong>pie3 </strong><br> What made you think of Hugh Laurie as the romantic lead? Couldn't you afford Hugh Grant? </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> Even if I could have afforded Hugh Grant, I always wanted Hugh Laurie. Hugh Laurie has a tremendous depth and integrity which makes his comedy all the richer. I think he is a brilliant screen actor, as they do in Hollywood where he is being offered increasingly exciting roles. Perhaps we are not best at promoting our own talent in this country, but I certainly got the bloke I wanted. </p> <p> <strong>gillianmar</strong><br> Why do think the UK with such a wealth of talent in novel/screen writing and acting make such weak movies? Someone once put this down to American kids having access to cinecameras/video cameras in their youth and British kids venting their creativity by picking up a guitar and getting into bands instead. What do you think? </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> Well, I'm not going to comment on the standards of British films as you have done, except to say that mine is brilliant. However I think the point you make about different influences in youth is an excellent one. Certainly the fact that our pop and rock industry is so good perhaps influences kids' dreams. I would add that British TV is also a world-beater and many of the artists who in America would go into film, in Britain find it easier to get into TV. We don't really have a film indstury in Britain as such but for our size we certainly have the greatest TV industry in the world. </p> <p><strong>blackbird21 </strong><br> Ben, do you, Rik, Ade, Alexi, Rowan etc ever get together for boys nights out? If so is it a case of cocktails at Soho house or a couple of pints and a curry in Brick Lane? </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> I don't really know Alexei, but Rik Ade and Rowan are all very good friends of mine. Ro doesn't really go to the pub so we might go to a restaurant, very possibly a curry. Rik, Ade and I love a pub. I was in one with Ade only a couple of days ago. I like champagne too. </p> <p><strong>Alderslade</strong><br> The inevitable Blackadder question. For the Dome BA it seemed Rowan's portrayal had a bit of Raymond Fowler in it saying 'sorry' allot and 'Ding Dong' and on the whole a devious but not a full on BA portrayal Can we expect him to be back to his verbally explosive best in the middle aged Blackadder that you and Richard have suggested could happen in 10 years or so? How likely is another series/one off? How did you find directing for the first time? How much more enjoyable was it directing your friends than say an ego inflated Hollywood actor? or would you have preferred the greater challenge of the latter? </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> Some of the people acting in my film are old friends but of course I asked them to do it not for that reason but because of what fine performers they are. Personally I don't think actors, even in Hollywood, are usually quite as you describe. I find them a pretty reasonable bunch. Certainly working with the cream of the new British acting talent didn't lead me to think they'd all become ego-inflated actors when they get famous. Basically I'm trying to say I had a great time with my cast and I don't know any of the sort of actors you are describing. Do you? </p> <p><strong>Julie30 </strong><br> If you could have written one other classic comedy series from Dads Army, Fawlty Towers or Ab Fab which would it have been? </p> <p><strong>Tamara</strong><br> Dear Ben, Blackadder is the funniest TV comedy ever written. When are you going to write another series? And, more importantly, when are you going to write another series? Please write another series. </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> I love you for your question. However you are wrong. Fawlty Towers is the funniest TV series ever written. Can you please write to John Cleese and ask him when he's going to do another series. You can say I asked you too, because he's quite scarey. As to the Blackadder, Richard and I often talk about it and we did do a bit of nonsense for the Dome. There are no immediate plans for anything else, but never say never again eh? </p> <p><strong>RussellCrowe</strong><br> Ben, did you like Gladiator? Have you ever considered doing a Blackadder prequel series set in Ancient Rome? </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> If it's really you, good on you mate! I'm an honorary half Aussie and I love your work. Right back to Romper Stomper, which was so hugely powerful. I have not seen Gladiator because of babies and work, but get this cyber fans! - Ridley invited me to a private screening. How cool is that? I am absolutely thrilled at what a huge success it is, and if you're not Russell, I'm still thrilled. </p> <p><strong>fiveonions </strong><br> Did you enjoy your experience of directing? Do you have something else lined up? I read that your film is based on your real-life experiences. Does your wife mind? </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> - Dear Five or should I call you Mr Onion? Yes, being a movie director was the best job I ever had. I do have something else lined up, it's called the rest of my life. The movie is a total fiction but when it came to municipal masturbation, I did my own research. My wife was very happy that I should make this movie - she thinks it's funny. </p> <p><strong>SpankTM </strong><br> How are plans for the movie of Popcorn progressing? Are the rumours true about Joel Schumacher being attached to the project, or do you have a proper director now? </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> Ooh spank put the knife back in the cutlery drawer. Joel was attached to Popcorn a while back, but Batman Forever went on forever and our 'window' closed. Popcorn is still very much alive as a movie project. I will contact you to ask your opinion on any future directors. </p> <p><strong>Idlewriter </strong><br> Ben do you have any plans to write your Autobiography yet? Although there's still a long way to go, there are people who've only been famous for 5 minutes who've penned theirs (and ended up with a slim volume). I'm sure yours would be far more interesting and weighty! </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> Sometimes I think it would be fun - I've been involved in some quite interesting things. In fact I did get excited about an idea to write a book called Seven Nine Nine Seven which would be my impressions of the Tory years during which I basically grew up. But a very funny book called Things Can Only Get Better beat me to it. My problem with writing biog would be talking about my friends, so I don't think I will. </p> <p><strong>Mismo </strong><br> Now that Tony Robinson is on the NEC, do you think he will work towards conciliation between the disaffected members and those at the top of the Labour party? And will you therefore get Mark Seddon to play Baldrick in any future Blackadders? </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> I never talk politics with Baldrick. </p> <p><strong>tonyblair2 </strong><br> You managed to get that old stager Hugh Laurie a part. Did you try to get his old stablemate Emma Thompson a part? If not why not? I think she'd be great in the next Ben Elton comedy. No more serious parts for our Emma. Is New Labour just like the yoof of yesterday? Is Elvis Costello a friend of yours? Is he bigger than you? </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> Great question. I think you must be my publicist. Emma IS in Maybe Baby. She was kind enough to agree to do a small but brilliantly written role playing a mad new-age loony friend who suggests that Hugh and Joely go bonking on lay lines to get a baby. She's brilliant in the movie as she always is. </p> <p><strong>tonyblair2 </strong><br> Yes, but is that because she's an old mate of Hugh's or because she's a great comedienne? If you see her, tell her the only movie I've ever fallen asleep during was Branagh's Henry V. I'm downloading Ride of the Valkyries now. Do you have any dodgy musical tastes? eg Paul Weller, Jam Tarts, Ed Kuepper, Jackson Browne. The only guy I've seen quicker than you was Spike. Asynchronous crowd laughter. Half the audience was laughing at the previous joke as he launched into the next one. 'course he was an old gaffer even then. When will you quit stand up? If ever? Seinfeld was a complete toss show. Something trivial goes wrong and they whinge about it for the next twenty minutes. Which was your favourite Fawlty Towers scene? </p> <p><strong>withnail20 </strong><br> Hello Ben. First I'd like to say that I am a fan of your work - I thought The Young Ones and Blackadder were fantastic and I've enjoyed several of your novels. Good luck with \"Maybe Baby\". <br> But I also have to say that I am fairly horrified at the prospect of this musical you have co-written with Andrew Lloyd Webber about the troubles in the North of Ireland. Isn't this the same Lloyd Webber who was an active supporter of Thatcher's Government in the 80's? Thatcher's Governments behaviour in dealing with my country was nothing less than shameful - she stubbornly stood by and watched 10 hunger strikers die, including Bobby Sands MP - this was a government propped up by the financial and vocal support of the likes of Lloyd Webber. A musical on this subject co-written by Lloyd Webber will be met with nothing but disdain by the Republican community not only in the North of Ireland but in every corner of this island. I just can't understand how you can reconcile your political beliefs with writing a musical with this man. </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> I am writing a musical with a composer of popular music, not with a political activist. The musical is a love story trying to deal with the emotions of non-political young people who live in a highly politicised and violent environment through a coincidence of birth. It is not written for the Republican or the Unionist community, or any other community, it is written for individuals who seek an hour or two's diversion from the cares of their lives. I am an entertainer who loves popular musicals. Andrew is also an entertainer. Of course there are people whose politics are so objectionable that I would not find it possible to work with them. Beyond the fact that Andrew publicly supported the Tories in the 80s, I know nothing of his politics. We don't discuss it. If I were to refuse to talk to Tories, I would narrow my social and professional scope considerably. If you judge all your relationships on a person's voting intentions, I think you miss out on the varieties of life. Your question was very emotional and very loaded. I do not think that Andrew Lloyd-Webber murdered Bobby Sands. But thank you for writing. Also, on the subject , Andrew lives in Ireland and I've been to a couple of pubs with him and they seem to be happy to serve him. </p> <p><strong>withnail20 </strong><br> Ben - If Lloyd Webber simply voted for the Tories what you say would be fine. He didn't. He was involved in promoting and funding a Government that damaged not just my country but yours also. He had hands on involvement - he even composed music for them, for God's sake! \"There are people whose politics are so objectionable that I would not find it possible to work with them\", you said. Surely this qualifies. </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> I suppose this is the problem with interviews. Here I am trying to promote my movie, but I'm discussing Andrew's politics. Still, for what it's worth, I have no idea whether he gave money to the Tories - I've never asked him. As to promoting them, I suppose he did so in the way I'm seen to have promoted Labour in that at election time I was happy to say who I was voting for. The composing is really why I wanted to write back to you because he did mention it to me saying that he'd actually written a tune for John Major, not Thatch. You and I would of course not dream of doing either, but for what it's worth, John Major had a very different take on the tragedy in Northern Ireland to Mrs Thatcher. I know you think I'm copping out when I say Look I'm an entertainer, I'm not an expert on Irish politics or any politics, but I'm going to say it anyway. I am happy with the decisions I take in my life because to the best of my ability I follow my conscience. If my conscience disappoints you I am sorry, but it is the work that matters and the musical is about the power of love. Naff? I've just had kids, there is no greater power. </p> <p><strong>withnail20 </strong><br> Ben - He did give money to the Tories. Ask him. </p> <p><strong>Idlewriter </strong><br> Ok, trivial question: Were you pretty \"peeved\" when Chris Evans nailed down your jacket recently on TFI Friday? You didn't look best pleased. </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> This is amazing. I cannot believe how many people thought that was my jacket. It was their bloody jacket for God's sake which they asked me to wear for the gag. I never thought people would believe it. Maybe it's because I looked so damn good in it. </p> <p><strong>victorla</strong><br> You will probably hate this question (I've seen you attacking a poor fellow for asking a similar one on TV), but do you think being successful (economically and career-wise) made you less critical of the establishment? Would you give up your (well earned) creature-comforts for a more egalitarian world? </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> Dear victorla, I do not know what 'the Establishment' is, but I don't think that my attitude towards living in Britain has changed with my success. I still hope for a fairer society although that will never mean everything the same for every body. I am not, and have never been, a communist. I am a welfare state Labour-supporter who thinks that Clement Atlee's post-war administration is the greatest in our history. I would be happy to pay higher taxes to see a greater commitment of resources to the community, and I think this should be done through government not through charity, although of course I do a lot of work for 'charidee' but I don't like to talk about it, even in cyberspace. There is such a thing as society - we all live there. </p> <p><strong>miner49er </strong><br> You're probably bored of being asked about Blackadder, but here goes... a) What is your ever favourite episode? (the Lord Flasheart one in series 4 perhaps?) b) What - in your opinion - was the funniest Blackadder series? 2,3 or 4? I'd say 2 just nicks it... </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> It's so nice that people love the Adder so much. It's different for me and I have to admit I probably haven't seen an episode for ten years. But series 2 would be my favourite because it was the first one I co-wrote. And the first episode which was called Bells but should really have been called 'Bob' will always have a special place in my heart. </p> <p><strong>Lianne88 </strong><br> Ben, you were brought up in East London, you've got a great sense of humour, you're loud and vocal about your opinions (and neuroses), is it any wonder people keep on mistaking you for a nice Jewish boy? </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> Nice funny question, being serious for a moment, to me, being Jewish is a matter of faith. I see it as a religion not a race. Personally I subscribe to no organised religion, but I am certainly a nice boy. </p> <p><strong>Lianne88</strong><br> Thanks for the reply - a little confused by the cryptic tone, but keeps us guessing here at www.totallyjewish.com!! Whether or not you see it as a faith, you must agree that Jewish people are blessed with the ability to laugh at themselves - Woody Allen, Jackie Mason, Neil Simon, Phil Silvers, etc. Ever been inspired/influenced by any of them? <br> p.s. how do you like your chicken soup?</p> <p><strong>BenjaminP </strong><br> As a teenager I was entranced with your lengthy diatribes on your television shows. how much of those rambles were scripted? such pace would suggest that there was a definite outline to your performances. Do you ever feel slightly caught up in the successful entertainers' high life and crave a quick hack through the countryside to counter-act the madness. As a singer sometimes at the mercy of the 'machine' in this business we call show I often crave a more grounding and earthy surrounding to retain my sanity. </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> All my routines are scripted, that's why they're funny. Good stuff doesn't come easily, but the greatest joy of all is to create an improvisation out of that script live on stage. but you have to improvise from strength. It would be an insult to the audience to just wander on and waffle. Yes I love to go walking in the countryside, but I did so long before I was a fabulous and glamorous celebrity. </p> <p><strong>Seona </strong><br> Do you think you'll ever escape the public perception of you as a mouthy bloke in a shiny suit ranting about Thatcher? </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> No. </p> <p><strong>achwong </strong><br> Are you glad Maybe Baby is all over, or are you raring to do another film comedy again? Will Phantom be your first 'serious' ie non-comedic project? Or can we expect to see the Phantom suddenly stopping for a five-minute routine about teacups on motorway service stations? :-) </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> Maybe Baby is not over because now we have world distribution, even in US ! So I must carry on doing things like this to flog it. But as I have said, I loved directing a movie and can think of nothing better than having the chance to do it again. </p> <p><strong>kdalt </strong><br> I loved the Young Ones and Filthy Rich and Catflap. However I can't understand why you would write such an inoffensive innocuous comedy like The Thin Blue Line? Also don't you think that comedies like Seinfeld are far funnier than anything Britain now produces </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> Dear K, I can't understand why you can't understand somebody doing something inoffensive and innocuous. If that was all anybody ever did, there would be no more war, and we would all be happy pixies. As far as I'm concerned, TBL was very funny, which was its sole ambition. However, actually I think it dealt with a number of issues relevant to policing - race, drugs, police violence, in quite an interesting way. Perhaps you didn't get past the first episode about buying a birthday present for the Queen. Regarding Seinfeld. It is a brilliant show, as are most of the American sitcoms we see on BBC2 and Channel 4. However, there are many many crap sitcoms that we don't see. The constantly stated idea that their comedies are funnier than ours is based on the strangest evidence. We see all our stuff, and the best of theirs. They think our stuff is better than theirs for exactly the same reason. In America they ask me 'Why can't we have more comedies like you have?' There's only ever a few decent shows. In the last 5 years or so, the Americans have produced the likes of Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, Frasier and Friends. All brilliant. We produced The Royle Family, Ab Fab, The Alan Patridge sitcom - all equally brilliant. I think it's not about nationality, but about quality, and we do pretty well. </p> <p><strong>A000457 </strong><br> Do you get embarrassed when people mention previous work of yours which you'd hoped had been forgotten by all and sundry? By the way, any chance of another series of Filthy, Rich and Catflap? </p> <p> <strong>BenElton</strong><br> I have to say the we all loved Filthy Rich and Catflap too. The critics loathed it, but the BBC were happy to go with it again. I don't know what got in the way - booze, babies and hair loss probably. But FR&amp;C is about horrible old blokes, so maybe we're just growing into the project. </p> <p><strong>MsMonkey</strong><br> You are a nice boy, Ben...I still have pleasant memory of you admiring my tattoo at a party many moons ago...(It was in Notting Hill of all places, the party, not my tatto - but it's okay, this isn't one of those, do you remember me queries!) I haven't really got a question, just to say great to see such a nice guy continuing to do so well for himself! </p> <p><strong>kdalt </strong><br> As an aspiring comedy writer I used the line \"he drinks like a mad viking celebrating his birthday on a bank holiday weekend\".

Maybe now I will read it just to see.</p> <p><strong>achwong </strong><br> Has anyone here seen Maybe Baby yet? :-) And where is Ben anyway? :) </p> <p><strong>BenElton</strong><br> Many people have seen the film.

      "bodyText": "naomi2 Stand-up comedy, scriptwriter, novelist, playwright, film director. Which do you enjoy most and which do you think you're best at? BenElton Everything I do is based on the scripts I write. So first and foremost I'm a writer. But directing your own film script is the best way to be a writer because you get to write in three dimensions. Idlewriter As a performer myself I was wondering how you found the enthusiasm to deliver your set when you're on a long tour. Is it hard not to just \"go through the motions\"? and, If there was one piece of advice you could give a new comic what would it be? BenElton I would advise you not to be idle. the only way to write good gags is to work very hard at it. Your first good idea just occurs to you. Every other idea has to be dragged screaming from somewhere inside. Tally43 Dear Ben, Why have you stopped doing 'political comedy'? Why has everyone pretty much stopped doing it? do you think your Thatcher bashing in the 80s made any difference - or was she and her government just an easy target and an easy laugh? Do you think comedians have a duty to raise the public's awareness of 'issues' or are they just there to amuse? . PS be honest... don't you miss her just a little bit? BenElton I do not miss Thatch in the slightest and yes, she was a very easy target for a comedian, but not for many disadvantaged people. I never did political comedy for the sake of it, I just wrote what I felt then, as I do now. If I was on live TV weekly, as I was with Saturday Live, I'm sure I would draw on the issues of the day just as I did then, although I would say that we live in considerably less edgy and confrontational times than when I started out as a comedian. Mrs Thatcher's greatest achievement was to shatter the Liberal Left post-war consensus in our society and replace it with a Liberal Right consensus. That happened in the 80s and they were tough times. (PS By greatest I mean biggest not best.) I do not think comedians or any artists have a duty to do anything other than express themselves to the best of their abilities. But sometimes 'issues' can be very amusing. pie3 What made you think of Hugh Laurie as the romantic lead? Couldn't you afford Hugh Grant? BenElton Even if I could have afforded Hugh Grant, I always wanted Hugh Laurie. Hugh Laurie has a tremendous depth and integrity which makes his comedy all the richer. I think he is a brilliant screen actor, as they do in Hollywood where he is being offered increasingly exciting roles. Perhaps we are not best at promoting our own talent in this country, but I certainly got the bloke I wanted. gillianmar Why do think the UK with such a wealth of talent in novel/screen writing and acting make such weak movies? Someone once put this down to American kids having access to cinecameras/video cameras in their youth and British kids venting their creativity by picking up a guitar and getting into bands instead. What do you think? BenElton Well, I'm not going to comment on the standards of British films as you have done, except to say that mine is brilliant. However I think the point you make about different influences in youth is an excellent one. Certainly the fact that our pop and rock industry is so good perhaps influences kids' dreams. I would add that British TV is also a world-beater and many of the artists who in America would go into film, in Britain find it easier to get into TV. We don't really have a film indstury in Britain as such but for our size we certainly have the greatest TV industry in the world. blackbird21 Ben, do you, Rik, Ade, Alexi, Rowan etc ever get together for boys nights out? If so is it a case of cocktails at Soho house or a couple of pints and a curry in Brick Lane? BenElton I don't really know Alexei, but Rik Ade and Rowan are all very good friends of mine. Ro doesn't really go to the pub so we might go to a restaurant, very possibly a curry. Rik, Ade and I love a pub. I was in one with Ade only a couple of days ago. I like champagne too. Alderslade The inevitable Blackadder question. For the Dome BA it seemed Rowan's portrayal had a bit of Raymond Fowler in it saying 'sorry' allot and 'Ding Dong' and on the whole a devious but not a full on BA portrayal Can we expect him to be back to his verbally explosive best in the middle aged Blackadder that you and Richard have suggested could happen in 10 years or so? How likely is another series/one off? How did you find directing for the first time? How much more enjoyable was it directing your friends than say an ego inflated Hollywood actor? or would you have preferred the greater challenge of the latter? BenElton Some of the people acting in my film are old friends but of course I asked them to do it not for that reason but because of what fine performers they are. Personally I don't think actors, even in Hollywood, are usually quite as you describe. I find them a pretty reasonable bunch. Certainly working with the cream of the new British acting talent didn't lead me to think they'd all become ego-inflated actors when they get famous. Basically I'm trying to say I had a great time with my cast and I don't know any of the sort of actors you are describing. Do you? Julie30 If you could have written one other classic comedy series from Dads Army, Fawlty Towers or Ab Fab which would it have been? Tamara Dear Ben, Blackadder is the funniest TV comedy ever written. When are you going to write another series? And, more importantly, when are you going to write another series? Please write another series. BenElton I love you for your question. However you are wrong. Fawlty Towers is the funniest TV series ever written. Can you please write to John Cleese and ask him when he's going to do another series. You can say I asked you too, because he's quite scarey. As to the Blackadder, Richard and I often talk about it and we did do a bit of nonsense for the Dome. There are no immediate plans for anything else, but never say never again eh? RussellCrowe Ben, did you like Gladiator? Have you ever considered doing a Blackadder prequel series set in Ancient Rome? BenElton If it's really you, good on you mate! I'm an honorary half Aussie and I love your work. Right back to Romper Stomper, which was so hugely powerful. I have not seen Gladiator because of babies and work, but get this cyber fans! - Ridley invited me to a private screening. How cool is that? I am absolutely thrilled at what a huge success it is, and if you're not Russell, I'm still thrilled. fiveonions Did you enjoy your experience of directing? Do you have something else lined up? I read that your film is based on your real-life experiences. Does your wife mind? BenElton - Dear Five or should I call you Mr Onion? Yes, being a movie director was the best job I ever had. I do have something else lined up, it's called the rest of my life. The movie is a total fiction but when it came to municipal masturbation, I did my own research. My wife was very happy that I should make this movie - she thinks it's funny. SpankTM How are plans for the movie of Popcorn progressing? Are the rumours true about Joel Schumacher being attached to the project, or do you have a proper director now? BenElton Ooh spank put the knife back in the cutlery drawer. Joel was attached to Popcorn a while back, but Batman Forever went on forever and our 'window' closed. Popcorn is still very much alive as a movie project. I will contact you to ask your opinion on any future directors. Idlewriter Ben do you have any plans to write your Autobiography yet? Although there's still a long way to go, there are people who've only been famous for 5 minutes who've penned theirs (and ended up with a slim volume). I'm sure yours would be far more interesting and weighty! BenElton Sometimes I think it would be fun - I've been involved in some quite interesting things. In fact I did get excited about an idea to write a book called Seven Nine Nine Seven which would be my impressions of the Tory years during which I basically grew up. But a very funny book called Things Can Only Get Better beat me to it. My problem with writing biog would be talking about my friends, so I don't think I will. Mismo Now that Tony Robinson is on the NEC, do you think he will work towards conciliation between the disaffected members and those at the top of the Labour party? And will you therefore get Mark Seddon to play Baldrick in any future Blackadders? BenElton I never talk politics with Baldrick. tonyblair2 You managed to get that old stager Hugh Laurie a part. Did you try to get his old stablemate Emma Thompson a part? If not why not? I think she'd be great in the next Ben Elton comedy. No more serious parts for our Emma. Is New Labour just like the yoof of yesterday? Is Elvis Costello a friend of yours? Is he bigger than you? BenElton Great question. I think you must be my publicist. Emma IS in Maybe Baby. She was kind enough to agree to do a small but brilliantly written role playing a mad new-age loony friend who suggests that Hugh and Joely go bonking on lay lines to get a baby. She's brilliant in the movie as she always is. tonyblair2 Yes, but is that because she's an old mate of Hugh's or because she's a great comedienne? If you see her, tell her the only movie I've ever fallen asleep during was Branagh's Henry V. I'm downloading Ride of the Valkyries now. Do you have any dodgy musical tastes? eg Paul Weller, Jam Tarts, Ed Kuepper, Jackson Browne. The only guy I've seen quicker than you was Spike. Asynchronous crowd laughter. Half the audience was laughing at the previous joke as he launched into the next one. 'course he was an old gaffer even then. When will you quit stand up? If ever? Seinfeld was a complete toss show. Something trivial goes wrong and they whinge about it for the next twenty minutes. Which was your favourite Fawlty Towers scene? withnail20 Hello Ben. First I'd like to say that I am a fan of your work - I thought The Young Ones and Blackadder were fantastic and I've enjoyed several of your novels. Good luck with \"Maybe Baby\". But I also have to say that I am fairly horrified at the prospect of this musical you have co-written with Andrew Lloyd Webber about the troubles in the North of Ireland. Isn't this the same Lloyd Webber who was an active supporter of Thatcher's Government in the 80's? Thatcher's Governments behaviour in dealing with my country was nothing less than shameful - she stubbornly stood by and watched 10 hunger strikers die, including Bobby Sands MP - this was a government propped up by the financial and vocal support of the likes of Lloyd Webber. A musical on this subject co-written by Lloyd Webber will be met with nothing but disdain by the Republican community not only in the North of Ireland but in every corner of this island. I just can't understand how you can reconcile your political beliefs with writing a musical with this man. BenElton I am writing a musical with a composer of popular music, not with a political activist. The musical is a love story trying to deal with the emotions of non-political young people who live in a highly politicised and violent environment through a coincidence of birth. It is not written for the Republican or the Unionist community, or any other community, it is written for individuals who seek an hour or two's diversion from the cares of their lives. I am an entertainer who loves popular musicals. Andrew is also an entertainer. Of course there are people whose politics are so objectionable that I would not find it possible to work with them. Beyond the fact that Andrew publicly supported the Tories in the 80s, I know nothing of his politics. We don't discuss it. If I were to refuse to talk to Tories, I would narrow my social and professional scope considerably. If you judge all your relationships on a person's voting intentions, I think you miss out on the varieties of life. Your question was very emotional and very loaded. I do not think that Andrew Lloyd-Webber murdered Bobby Sands. But thank you for writing. Also, on the subject , Andrew lives in Ireland and I've been to a couple of pubs with him and they seem to be happy to serve him. withnail20 Ben - If Lloyd Webber simply voted for the Tories what you say would be fine. He didn't. He was involved in promoting and funding a Government that damaged not just my country but yours also. He had hands on involvement - he even composed music for them, for God's sake! \"There are people whose politics are so objectionable that I would not find it possible to work with them\", you said. Surely this qualifies. BenElton I suppose this is the problem with interviews. Here I am trying to promote my movie, but I'm discussing Andrew's politics. Still, for what it's worth, I have no idea whether he gave money to the Tories - I've never asked him. As to promoting them, I suppose he did so in the way I'm seen to have promoted Labour in that at election time I was happy to say who I was voting for. The composing is really why I wanted to write back to you because he did mention it to me saying that he'd actually written a tune for John Major, not Thatch. You and I would of course not dream of doing either, but for what it's worth, John Major had a very different take on the tragedy in Northern Ireland to Mrs Thatcher. I know you think I'm copping out when I say Look I'm an entertainer, I'm not an expert on Irish politics or any politics, but I'm going to say it anyway. I am happy with the decisions I take in my life because to the best of my ability I follow my conscience. If my conscience disappoints you I am sorry, but it is the work that matters and the musical is about the power of love. Naff? I've just had kids, there is no greater power. withnail20 Ben - He did give money to the Tories. Ask him. Idlewriter Ok, trivial question: Were you pretty \"peeved\" when Chris Evans nailed down your jacket recently on TFI Friday? You didn't look best pleased. BenElton This is amazing. I cannot believe how many people thought that was my jacket. It was their bloody jacket for God's sake which they asked me to wear for the gag. I never thought people would believe it. Maybe it's because I looked so damn good in it. victorla You will probably hate this question (I've seen you attacking a poor fellow for asking a similar one on TV), but do you think being successful (economically and career-wise) made you less critical of the establishment? Would you give up your (well earned) creature-comforts for a more egalitarian world? BenElton Dear victorla, I do not know what 'the Establishment' is, but I don't think that my attitude towards living in Britain has changed with my success. I still hope for a fairer society although that will never mean everything the same for every body. I am not, and have never been, a communist. I am a welfare state Labour-supporter who thinks that Clement Atlee's post-war administration is the greatest in our history. I would be happy to pay higher taxes to see a greater commitment of resources to the community, and I think this should be done through government not through charity, although of course I do a lot of work for 'charidee' but I don't like to talk about it, even in cyberspace. There is such a thing as society - we all live there. miner49er You're probably bored of being asked about Blackadder, but here goes... a) What is your ever favourite episode? (the Lord Flasheart one in series 4 perhaps?) b) What - in your opinion - was the funniest Blackadder series? 2,3 or 4? I'd say 2 just nicks it... BenElton It's so nice that people love the Adder so much. It's different for me and I have to admit I probably haven't seen an episode for ten years. But series 2 would be my favourite because it was the first one I co-wrote. And the first episode which was called Bells but should really have been called 'Bob' will always have a special place in my heart. Lianne88 Ben, you were brought up in East London, you've got a great sense of humour, you're loud and vocal about your opinions (and neuroses), is it any wonder people keep on mistaking you for a nice Jewish boy? BenElton Nice funny question, being serious for a moment, to me, being Jewish is a matter of faith. I see it as a religion not a race. Personally I subscribe to no organised religion, but I am certainly a nice boy. Lianne88 Thanks for the reply - a little confused by the cryptic tone, but keeps us guessing here at www.totallyjewish.com!! Whether or not you see it as a faith, you must agree that Jewish people are blessed with the ability to laugh at themselves - Woody Allen, Jackie Mason, Neil Simon, Phil Silvers, etc. Ever been inspired/influenced by any of them? p.s. how do you like your chicken soup? BenjaminP As a teenager I was entranced with your lengthy diatribes on your television shows. how much of those rambles were scripted? such pace would suggest that there was a definite outline to your performances. Do you ever feel slightly caught up in the successful entertainers' high life and crave a quick hack through the countryside to counter-act the madness. As a singer sometimes at the mercy of the 'machine' in this business we call show I often crave a more grounding and earthy surrounding to retain my sanity. BenElton All my routines are scripted, that's why they're funny. Good stuff doesn't come easily, but the greatest joy of all is to create an improvisation out of that script live on stage. but you have to improvise from strength. It would be an insult to the audience to just wander on and waffle. Yes I love to go walking in the countryside, but I did so long before I was a fabulous and glamorous celebrity. Seona Do you think you'll ever escape the public perception of you as a mouthy bloke in a shiny suit ranting about Thatcher? BenElton No. achwong Are you glad Maybe Baby is all over, or are you raring to do another film comedy again? Will Phantom be your first 'serious' ie non-comedic project? Or can we expect to see the Phantom suddenly stopping for a five-minute routine about teacups on motorway service stations? :-) BenElton Maybe Baby is not over because now we have world distribution, even in US ! So I must carry on doing things like this to flog it. But as I have said, I loved directing a movie and can think of nothing better than having the chance to do it again. kdalt I loved the Young Ones and Filthy Rich and Catflap. However I can't understand why you would write such an inoffensive innocuous comedy like The Thin Blue Line? Also don't you think that comedies like Seinfeld are far funnier than anything Britain now produces BenElton Dear K, I can't understand why you can't understand somebody doing something inoffensive and innocuous. If that was all anybody ever did, there would be no more war, and we would all be happy pixies. As far as I'm concerned, TBL was very funny, which was its sole ambition. However, actually I think it dealt with a number of issues relevant to policing - race, drugs, police violence, in quite an interesting way. Perhaps you didn't get past the first episode about buying a birthday present for the Queen. Regarding Seinfeld. It is a brilliant show, as are most of the American sitcoms we see on BBC2 and Channel 4. However, there are many many crap sitcoms that we don't see. The constantly stated idea that their comedies are funnier than ours is based on the strangest evidence. We see all our stuff, and the best of theirs. They think our stuff is better than theirs for exactly the same reason. In America they ask me 'Why can't we have more comedies like you have?' There's only ever a few decent shows. In the last 5 years or so, the Americans have produced the likes of Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, Frasier and Friends. All brilliant. We produced The Royle Family, Ab Fab, The Alan Patridge sitcom - all equally brilliant. I think it's not about nationality, but about quality, and we do pretty well. A000457 Do you get embarrassed when people mention previous work of yours which you'd hoped had been forgotten by all and sundry? By the way, any chance of another series of Filthy, Rich and Catflap? BenElton I have to say the we all loved Filthy Rich and Catflap too. The critics loathed it, but the BBC were happy to go with it again. I don't know what got in the way - booze, babies and hair loss probably. But FR&amp;C is about horrible old blokes, so maybe we're just growing into the project. MsMonkey You are a nice boy, Ben...I still have pleasant memory of you admiring my tattoo at a party many moons ago...(It was in Notting Hill of all places, the party, not my tatto - but it's okay, this isn't one of those, do you remember me queries!) I haven't really got a question, just to say great to see such a nice guy continuing to do so well for himself! kdalt As an aspiring comedy writer I used the line \"he drinks like a mad viking celebrating his birthday on a bank holiday weekend\". Is this too Blackadderish would I be sued by yourself and Richard Curtis? sgoodas kdalt: It is precisely that type of 'comedy writing' ie, uninspired and based on past comedies that lies behind the current malaise in TV sitcoms. tonyblair2 MsMonkey: Ben is a star.

      "bodyText": "David Trimble went back to his day job this morning. But as the Northern Ireland executive got back to work, there were rumbles of continuing dissent - and an even more ominous crackling of gunfire in the background. The resumption of devolved government has come as a relief to most of the main parties in Ulster, and no doubt to its long-suffering people. But one of the most important power-brokers in the province, Ian Paisley, is refusing to give his blessing to the latest attempt to make the Good Friday peace accords work. Two leading members of his Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) were absent from their government departments this morning. Peter Robinson, the minister for regional development, and Nigel Dodds, minister for social development, are said to be keen to resume their ministerial careers - though they are still refusing to attend cabinet meetings which include members of Sinn Fein. But Mr Paisley has apparently set his mind against further power-sharing. His party council meets tonight to take a final decision. If the vote goes against participation, the two seats will be allocated to Mr Trimble's Ulster Unionist party, and to the moderate Alliance party. The latest phase of power-sharing will no doubt survive a boycott by the DUP, though the new government will dismiss the Paisleyite faction at its peril. Mr Trimble was on mischievous form on this morning's Radio Four Today programme, when he compared the DUP to an autocratic East European party, conducting its business behind closed doors. \"We wait to see whether there's a puff of white smoke coming out from wherever they go into conference,\" he said - a throwaway gibe calculated to enrage Mr Paisley, who loathes all things papal. Northern Ireland's First Minister has already bitterly offended his Sinn Fein colleagues, by remarking that the republican party has still be politically \"house-trained\". With political nerves still scraped raw by the disputes of recent weeks, Mr Trimble would be well advised to suppress his predilection for cheap taunts, and instead brace himself for the coming storms. For it is clear that the Northern Ireland executive cannot expect plain sailing. Its most immediate problem, as it returns to the bread-and-butter business of running the province, is to put behind it the corrosive row over IRA disarmament. But with the first weapons inspections due in a matter of days, the issue will remain at the forefront of public and political attention. Then there is the continuing mutual recrimination between the Unionists and Sinn Fein over the vexed issues of police reform, and the flying of national flags over public buildings. The Unionists want to retain the name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the right to fly the Union flag - symbols of British rule vehemently rejected by republicans and for that matter the moderate nationalists of the Social Democratic and Labour Party. John Taylor, the Ulster Unionist deputy leader, has raised the political temperature over the weekend by hinting that Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson has offered concessions to the party, to entice it back into power-sharing. If that is so, we could see yet another breakdown of the fragile devolution experiment. A threat literally more deadly than any of the political shadow boxing, lurks on the streets of Northern Ireland. Recent days have brought a spate of shooting incidents in the murderous feud between two of the most ruthless loyalist paramilitary gangs, the Ulster Volunteer Force and a breakaway faction, the Loyalist Volunteer Force. A third group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, is said to be getting involved in the brutal dispute. Even more chilling, the IRA has offered grim evidence that it too is still in business. It is hotly suspected of murdering a leading loyalist over the weekend. Eddie McCoy, gunned down in a Belfast suburban bar, was targeted not for his paramilitary activity, but for his alleged involvement in drug dealing. The IRA long ago declared war on drug dealers; a war which has claimed at least 11 lives during the organisation's so-called ceasefire.

Tackling bullying requires careful and sensitive handling in order not to aggravate the problem.

The bully frogs' victim is Hugo, a small frog - with a proportionately small croak. Following some sage advice from a judicious duck, however, Hugo discovers a new talent (for quacking!) which proves enough to send his surprised bullies packing. </p> <p>A tendency to bully is often a sign that the bully has insecurities of his or her own. In <strong> Bullysaurus</strong> <strong> Under The Sea</strong> (Damon Burnard, Hodder, \u00a33.50, 6+), harmonious island life is shattered by the arrival of a large, noisy dinosaur. In this case, it becomes apparent that the bully just needs to be urged to explore other ways of using his particular skills, in order for peace to be restored. </p> <p>Physical attributes often provide bullies with ammunition. In Elizabeth Laird's <strong> Secret Friends</strong> (Hodder, \u00a31.99, 8-11), Rafaella's prominent ears are the cause of her unhappiness, and lead to tragic consequences. Picked on by the rest of the school, only one girl is willing to be friends with Rafaella, and only if they keep it a secret. It is moving and well illustrated and offers a painful reminder that the possible impact of mindless \"teasing\" should never be underestimated. </p> <p>Bullies generally target those who are smaller, weaker, less confident - or just plain different. In <strong> Stiks and Stoans</strong> by Andrew Matthews (Mammoth, \u00a34.99, 9+), the victim is dyslexic and overweight. Ella's increasing unhappiness at the hands of a group of schoolboys is described through diary entries, interspersed with narration by Liam, a new boy at school. Liam's situation illustrates just how easy it is to ignore bullying, or even join in, to safeguard one's own acceptance by one's peers. </p> <p>It is a sad fact that a bully can find almost any excuse to single out a potential victim. <strong> What's Your Problem?</strong> (Sherry Ashworth, Livewire, \u00a34.99, 11+) provides a terrifying reminder of just how little ammunition a proficient bully needs. Jac is a confident teenager in the middle of her GCSEs when she has to move schools. Her public school history provides the initial material for ringleader Lisa, but this is then followed by the sort of general \"bitchiness\" at which teenage girls really excel. Jac's self-confidence and happiness gradually crumble as the cruelty intensifies, until she is finally forced to take action and stand up to the bully. </p> <p>Finally, on the non-fiction front, Rosemary Stones' <strong> Don't Pick On Me</strong> (Piccadilly, \u00a35.99, 7-12) provides plenty of valuable material for understanding and handling bullying. It could prove helpful for use with almost any age.</p> <p>\u0095 For a full list of books on bullying call Book Trust on 0906 5161193 (calls cost \u00a31.50 a minute).

Her public school history provides the initial material for ringleader Lisa, but this is then followed by the sort of general \"bitchiness\" at which teenage girls really excel. Jac's self-confidence and happiness gradually crumble as the cruelty intensifies, until she is finally forced to take action and stand up to the bully. Finally, on the non-fiction front, Rosemary Stones' Don't Pick On Me (Piccadilly, \u00a35.99, 7-12) provides plenty of valuable material for understanding and handling bullying. It could prove helpful for use with almost any age. \u0095 For a full list of books on bullying call Book Trust on 0906 5161193 (calls cost \u00a31.50 a minute). If you are being bullied, Childline (0800 1111) is a freephone number and open 24 hours a day.",

      "body": "<p>There is one give-away sign that a university vice-chancellor is planning to stand down: a sudden hike in their five figure salary in the annual university report. As with successful football managers and business chief executives, academic leaders can now negotiate one final lucrative contract before retiring from the pressurised world of managing a large institution. </p> <p>There is also a perfect time to leave. Ignore all the conciliatory language you hear from academics about the importance of teaching students and working with industry. Research is what matters. The more academic and esoteric the better. And with all the kudos and money it brings, the Research Assessment Exercise is the only competition worth entering in the academic world. </p> <p>The canny university head bows out just after the last university department makes its submissions to the exercise, but before the results are announced six months later. The official reason for this is that it gives a successor time to stamp their personality on the institution and take their own gambles in the academic transfer market in preparation for the next assessment in four years' time. But among the university council circuit, everyone knows the real reason: if the results go well, credit can still be taken; if they go badly, blame can be avoided. </p> <p>Take Professor Sir Gareth Roberts for example. According to the most recent records, Sheffield University's vice-chancellor enjoyed a whopping 8.5% pay increase in 1998. Another 6.3% rise in 1999 took his total salary to \u00a3136,000. Not bad for a sector where the average lecturer's salary is \u00a327,000, and funding per student has fallen by more than 40% over the last 20 years. Last December Roberts announced he was leaving the university after 10 enjoyable years. The date? - April 31 2001, the last day for entries to the 2001 assessment. </p> <p>Then there is Sir Brian Follett, the vice-chancellor of Warwick University. Consecutive pay rises of 5.8% and 4.8% in the last two years have catapulted his salary to \u00a3114,412. Last month the university announced that he is standing down after eight years in post - at the end of next April. </p> <p>In any normal academic year, these moves would be part of the usual sea sonal patterns among the academic elite that trace a steady turnover of the top university positions. But what distinguishes the coming year is the scale of the impending retirements. Half of the Russell group - the country's 19 most powerful university heads - will be gone by the time the research assessment results are unveiled at the end of 2001. </p> <p>Newcastle's vice-chancellor, James Wright, leaves at the end of the year. Imperial College's rector, Lord Oxburgh, leaves on March 31 2001. Bristol's Sir John Kingman, will leave before August 31 2001. Birmingham and Cardiff heads Maxwell Irvine and Sir Brian Smith retire at the end of September 2001. And rumours are rife that the Manchester vice-chancellor, Sir Martin Harris, will be next to join the list, though he denies them. </p> <p>The mass exodus has prompted a crisis among academic headhunters, who are scrambling around for potential successors. Some fear that there isn't enough talent around to fill the empty seats at the high table. \"There are lots of senior people untested at this level,\" bemoaned one vice-chancellor. \"You can't just recruit a vice-chancellor from a smaller uni versity - it would be like giving first division football managers a place in the premier league.\" It is as if the managers of Manchester United, Liverpool, Leeds, Arsenal and Chelsea all resigned at the same time. </p> <p>And all this comes at a time when the academic sector is bracing itself for radical reforms. In private the prime minister's advisers are resigned to the fact that universities must be freed from current state controls if they are to prosper as businesses in the increasingly global market place for students and research grants. In the not too distant future, tuition fees and student numbers, as well as professorial salaries, will be determined by market forces, not nationally set quotas. </p> <p>Roberts has been tempted away from Sheffield by one of the best post-VC jobs in the business: president of Wolfson College, Oxford. This is ideal for those who fancy a step down to a less pressurised academic life. But it also allows time for maintaining a national presence by serving on various national committees and inquiries. In semi-retirement, Roberts is likely only to enhance his reputation as the networker supreme, continuing to advise the government on science, biotechnology, university funding and researchers' careers. </p> <p>Next year will see another vice-chancellor leave to snap up arguably the most attractive job of all: chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Three heads consistently emerge as possible candidates: Manchester's Sir Martin Harris; Southampton's Howard Newby; and Sir David Watson, director of Brighton University. Watson started as the outside bet. But there is now a whisper that education ministers want to appoint a well respected figure from the new university sector. Watson fits the bill perfectly. </p> <p>Job offers are not the reason for all the moves, though. Many heads are simply retiring. Some, it is claimed, have been pushed. But they are all members of the original set who eight years ago first started meeting at the dusty old rooms of the Russell Hotel in London. The group united the heads of the large redbrick and Oxbridge universities at a time when their research budgets looked to be under threat. The former polytechnics had become universities in 1992, doubling the number of institutions fighting for a share of the funding council's \u00a3600m research budget. </p> <p>It soon emerged that the group was lobbying funding chiefs to ensure that 75% of research grants remained in the 20 oldest and largest universities. This was the most exclusive academic elite of clubs. And yet there was no trace of its existence - no official papers or spokesmen - only adding to its mystique and reputation. The legend of the Russell group was born. </p> <p>And the break-up of the group comes when it is now at the very height of its power. In the early days it was a squabble over research funds. Now the talk concerns much wider topics: student top-up fees and global education markets. And for the first time the group appears genuinely to have the government's ear. </p> <p>When the education secretary, David Blunkett, hinted that during a second parliamentary term ministers might allow universities to charge their own fees, the group took the unprecedented step of commissioning an economic study into the impacts of deregulating fees and student intakes. The prime minister's education adviser, Andrew Adonis, has privately urged the group to openly explore such issues, which not so long ago were off-limits even under the Tory government. Cleverly, the Russell group heads argue that fees make social and economic sense: why should the state subsidise the education of middle-class students who then earn high wages? </p> <p>These views may become more extreme if the academic old guard make way for a new era of hard-nosed businesspeople in top academic positions. The Russell group packs a powerful punch. Director of the London School of Economics and New Labour insider Anthony Giddens has proved a useful addition as discussions with government have intensified. Add to this the clout of Sir Richard Sykes, Glaxo Wellcome's chief executive, who is widely tipped to become the new rector of Imperial College, and the group appears even more formidable. </p> <p>Hiring business leaders, though, would buck a long-standing trend. In a book out later this year Kingston's vice-chancellor, Peter Scott, concludes that the backgrounds of university heads have hardly changed over the years. \"Vice-chancellors are drawn from almost precisely the same background now as they were 30 years ago,\" he says. \"There are few people who haven't been academics.\" </p> <p>Yet Sykes' experience of merger talks and global competition could be invaluable in the new job. Recent signs that Birmingham and Aston universities are finally to merge suggest that further academic mergers are in the pipeline. St Andrews and Dundee, Warwick and Leicester, and even a University of Yorkshire have been rumoured.

      "bodyText": "There is one give-away sign that a university vice-chancellor is planning to stand down: a sudden hike in their five figure salary in the annual university report. As with successful football managers and business chief executives, academic leaders can now negotiate one final lucrative contract before retiring from the pressurised world of managing a large institution. There is also a perfect time to leave. Ignore all the conciliatory language you hear from academics about the importance of teaching students and working with industry. Research is what matters. The more academic and esoteric the better. And with all the kudos and money it brings, the Research Assessment Exercise is the only competition worth entering in the academic world. The canny university head bows out just after the last university department makes its submissions to the exercise, but before the results are announced six months later. The official reason for this is that it gives a successor time to stamp their personality on the institution and take their own gambles in the academic transfer market in preparation for the next assessment in four years' time. But among the university council circuit, everyone knows the real reason: if the results go well, credit can still be taken; if they go badly, blame can be avoided. Take Professor Sir Gareth Roberts for example. According to the most recent records, Sheffield University's vice-chancellor enjoyed a whopping 8.5% pay increase in 1998. Another 6.3% rise in 1999 took his total salary to \u00a3136,000. Not bad for a sector where the average lecturer's salary is \u00a327,000, and funding per student has fallen by more than 40% over the last 20 years. Last December Roberts announced he was leaving the university after 10 enjoyable years. The date? - April 31 2001, the last day for entries to the 2001 assessment. Then there is Sir Brian Follett, the vice-chancellor of Warwick University. Consecutive pay rises of 5.8% and 4.8% in the last two years have catapulted his salary to \u00a3114,412. Last month the university announced that he is standing down after eight years in post - at the end of next April. In any normal academic year, these moves would be part of the usual sea sonal patterns among the academic elite that trace a steady turnover of the top university positions. But what distinguishes the coming year is the scale of the impending retirements. Half of the Russell group - the country's 19 most powerful university heads - will be gone by the time the research assessment results are unveiled at the end of 2001. Newcastle's vice-chancellor, James Wright, leaves at the end of the year. Imperial College's rector, Lord Oxburgh, leaves on March 31 2001. Bristol's Sir John Kingman, will leave before August 31 2001. Birmingham and Cardiff heads Maxwell Irvine and Sir Brian Smith retire at the end of September 2001. And rumours are rife that the Manchester vice-chancellor, Sir Martin Harris, will be next to join the list, though he denies them. The mass exodus has prompted a crisis among academic headhunters, who are scrambling around for potential successors. Some fear that there isn't enough talent around to fill the empty seats at the high table. \"There are lots of senior people untested at this level,\" bemoaned one vice-chancellor. \"You can't just recruit a vice-chancellor from a smaller uni versity - it would be like giving first division football managers a place in the premier league.\" It is as if the managers of Manchester United, Liverpool, Leeds, Arsenal and Chelsea all resigned at the same time.

This is a government that taxes more but delivers less,\" said Mr Portillo.</p> <p>After three years of trying to impose solutions from Whitehall across traditional departmental barriers, ministers are aware how intractable some policy problems and neighbourhoods are.</p> <p>The new floor targets model, due to come into effect in 2001-02, means that the worst-performing schools, hospitals or crime-ridden police authorities will be required to raise their game by a specified minimum, instead of being allowed to hide behind the average rise achieved by more successful rivals.</p> <p>Failure will not be punished by loss of funds but by more central intervention, including sackings as a last resort. Targets as different as adult literacy, GCSE results, train punctuality and rates of cancer cure are in Whitehall's sights.</p> <p>Those who show they can deliver the goods will get more money and less government interference.</p> <p>Mr Brown's team is still negotiating bilaterally with individual spending ministers, while Mr Blair's policy unit staff ride shotgun, ready to advise the prime minister that his arbitration is necessary.</p> <p>However, Treasury officials now believe that the downward pressure on social security spending will allow them to add around \u00a328bn to spending ministries other than health by 2003-04. Alan Milburn, the health secretary, has already been promised \u00a313bn for the NHS over four years - 35% in real terms.</p>",

With Tony Blair on quasi-paternity leave at Chequers the deputy prime minister will raise the government's banner in Gillingham, Kent, today. Mr Prescott will back Mr Brown's attack on unjustified privilege at Oxford and Cambridge. The whole country will benefit if \"employment, economic, educational and social barriers to opportunity that still exist in Britain today\" are broken down, he will say. Citing action for pensioners, education and regional development agencies - his own brainchild - Mr Prescott will insist: \"These measures we are putting through benefit not just the heartlands, not just middle England, because the two are united by common instincts, common values and a common desire to remove the barriers that hold people back.\" As for the July spending review, it will be presented in terms of \"opportunity for all\", the theme ministers intend to deploy in the election run-up, as they accuse the Conservatives of elitism. Michael Portillo, the shadow chancellor, gave a hint of how the Tories will attack Labour's huge spending plans, an extra \u00a340bn by 2004, by saying there is little to show for it. \"Gordon Brown's extra taxes are bad enough but what makes people angry is that the things they care about, like schools, hospitals and law and order, are not getting any better. This is a government that taxes more but delivers less,\" said Mr Portillo. After three years of trying to impose solutions from Whitehall across traditional departmental barriers, ministers are aware how intractable some policy problems and neighbourhoods are. The new floor targets model, due to come into effect in 2001-02, means that the worst-performing schools, hospitals or crime-ridden police authorities will be required to raise their game by a specified minimum, instead of being allowed to hide behind the average rise achieved by more successful rivals. Failure will not be punished by loss of funds but by more central intervention, including sackings as a last resort. Targets as different as adult literacy, GCSE results, train punctuality and rates of cancer cure are in Whitehall's sights. Those who show they can deliver the goods will get more money and less government interference. Mr Brown's team is still negotiating bilaterally with individual spending ministers, while Mr Blair's policy unit staff ride shotgun, ready to advise the prime minister that his arbitration is necessary. However, Treasury officials now believe that the downward pressure on social security spending will allow them to add around \u00a328bn to spending ministries other than health by 2003-04. Alan Milburn, the health secretary, has already been promised \u00a313bn for the NHS over four years - 35% in real terms.",

      "body": "<p>This month has seen the publication of two major books by leading black British intellectuals, Paul Gilroy's polemic Between Camps and Caryl Phillips's reflective travelogue, The Atlantic Sound. The books, like their authors, are very different but Gilroy and Phillips have at least one thing in common: prestigious professorial posts at American universities - Gilroy at Yale, since quitting as a professor at Goldsmith's College in London last year, and Phillips at Columbia.</p> <p>They are not alone: other key black or Asian scholars and artists with teaching posts in the US include the academics Homi Bhabha and Kobena Mercer, the writers Fred D'Aguiar and Merle Collins, the filmmaker Isaac Julien and the artist Winston Branch. This might be a success story: Britain's brightest and most creative wooed by a superpower with whose wealth and resources we cannot compete. But many don't see it that way.</p> <p>Phillips, who insists he has \"never left\" his primary source of creativity thanks to air miles, says: \"Tertiary education in Britain doesn't value the people who work in it, so there's a leakage to the US.\" He doesn't see this as a particularly black problem; white writers and academics are drawn west just as strongly, he says.</p> <p>But Professor Lola Young of Middlesex University, who wrote recently in this newspaper that \"black intellectuals . . . often have a hard time getting their work taken seriously\", believes the lack of recognition has another dimension. \"Britain is still in thrall to America,\" she says. \"The media are more likely to seek African-American feminists, say, as cultural commmentators than black British intellectuals.\"</p> <p>While the word \"intellectual\" is often accompanied by a sneer, some claim that turns to open scorn for those who theorise about race. Gilroy, who claims many in Britain see the term \"black intellectual\" as \"oxymoronic\", says: \"Even to be interested in race, let alone to assert its centrality to British nationalism, is to sacrifice the right to be taken seriously.\"</p> <p>Edward Said, in his 1992 Reith lectures, saw one task of the intellectual as \"to break down the stereotypes and reductive categories that are so limiting to human thought and communication\". While academic writing can be abstruse, its ideas have a way of filtering into society; the current film of Mansfield Park would be impossible without Said's thought on Jane Austen's links to Caribbean slavery.

      "bodyText": "This month has seen the publication of two major books by leading black British intellectuals, Paul Gilroy's polemic Between Camps and Caryl Phillips's reflective travelogue, The Atlantic Sound. The books, like their authors, are very different but Gilroy and Phillips have at least one thing in common: prestigious professorial posts at American universities - Gilroy at Yale, since quitting as a professor at Goldsmith's College in London last year, and Phillips at Columbia. They are not alone: other key black or Asian scholars and artists with teaching posts in the US include the academics Homi Bhabha and Kobena Mercer, the writers Fred D'Aguiar and Merle Collins, the filmmaker Isaac Julien and the artist Winston Branch. This might be a success story: Britain's brightest and most creative wooed by a superpower with whose wealth and resources we cannot compete. But many don't see it that way. Phillips, who insists he has \"never left\" his primary source of creativity thanks to air miles, says: \"Tertiary education in Britain doesn't value the people who work in it, so there's a leakage to the US.\" He doesn't see this as a particularly black problem; white writers and academics are drawn west just as strongly, he says. But Professor Lola Young of Middlesex University, who wrote recently in this newspaper that \"black intellectuals . . . often have a hard time getting their work taken seriously\", believes the lack of recognition has another dimension. \"Britain is still in thrall to America,\" she says. \"The media are more likely to seek African-American feminists, say, as cultural commmentators than black British intellectuals.\" While the word \"intellectual\" is often accompanied by a sneer, some claim that turns to open scorn for those who theorise about race. Gilroy, who claims many in Britain see the term \"black intellectual\" as \"oxymoronic\", says: \"Even to be interested in race, let alone to assert its centrality to British nationalism, is to sacrifice the right to be taken seriously.\" Edward Said, in his 1992 Reith lectures, saw one task of the intellectual as \"to break down the stereotypes and reductive categories that are so limiting to human thought and communication\". While academic writing can be abstruse, its ideas have a way of filtering into society; the current film of Mansfield Park would be impossible without Said's thought on Jane Austen's links to Caribbean slavery. Yet how are debates on, say, political asylum or institutional racism to be raised above the level of tabloid journalism if those doing rigorous, long-term thinking on such issues are derided? Heidi Safia Mirza, professor of racial equality studies at Middlesex, says: \"There's no critical capacity to talk about race issues here; we have no such intellectual tradition. We talk in very regressive ways; 19th-century ideas about genes and blood are at the heart of a lot of 'commonsense' thinking, which is not challenged in schools.\" The result, says Gilroy, is that \"political and policy debate gets jammed\". He accuses the government of unleashing a lethal xenophobia partly by paying no heed to historical links between race, nationalism and immigration. Few would see US race politics as more healthy, but the ubiquity of African-American thinkers such as Skip Gates, Cornell West and Patricia Williams as media pundits is in marked contrast to Britain, where, as Gilroy says: \"It's incredible that Sivanandan and Stuart Hall have had to wait till now to be admitted to the magic circle of media commentators.\" The writer Ferdinand Dennis, who has coedited a new anthology of three generations of black and Asian writers and intellectuals, says: \"It's easier to get attention if we're victims and beaten up by racist thugs, when they can pour liberal sympathy on us, than if we're reflecting on our own experience here.\" Kobena Mercer at Cornell University, who works in diaspora studies, says there is a longer tradition of debating race issues in the US. \"Universities reflect the history of race relations in the two countries; because the US was a segregated society, official institutions have had to deal with race in a way they haven't in Britain.

There's the gang of four, the improbable Worthington Cup victories, the arrival of Stanley Victor Collymore (\"But... we thought you were dead!!?\") and, to cap it all off, the tragic departure of Martin O'Neill.</p> <p>Or not. You see, while early this morning O'Neill was still mulling over the offer of the Celtic manager's job, and at lunchtime he had agreed to leave Leicester for Glasgow, by tea-time Leicester were saying that nothing had been decided and that nothing will be decided today. The club refused to confirm to the Fiver whether or not O'Neill is still in discussions with the Foxy Foxes (it must have been our tone of voice), but it is widely believed that chairman John Elsom is this evening making one last attempt to keep the Irishman at the club. Stapling his feet to the boardroom floor is probably Elsom's best bet.</p> <p>So any managerial move remains uncertain. Which means the jury hasn't even had a chance to be out over whether O'Neill has the right pedigree for Parkhead. One thing that does seem unlikely, however, is that Foxy record signing Darren Eadie is the sort of player 60,000 baying season-ticket holders have in mind when it comes to regenerating what is currently the ailing manufacturing arm of the Old Firm.

      "bodyText": "Britain signed up to greater cooperation with its EU partners yesterday, with agreements to share criminal intelligence and to allow UK immigration officials to operate in France. EU ministers signed the mutual legal assistance convention, which allows for cooperation on criminal investigations. It gives German police, for example, the right to tap the telephone of a suspect living in Britain, or vice versa. Jack Straw, the home secretary, and Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement, his French counterpart, finalised details of a treaty permitting British immigration officers to check passengers before they board the Eurostar at Paris's Gare du Nord and other stations in France. With controversy over illegal immigrants and asylum seekers in recent months, the cross-Channel rail link has become a popular route for refugees, especially Albanians and Somalians, seeking a new life in Britain. Under the agreement, signed in Brussels, French officials will be able to operate reciprocally at Waterloo and Ashford. British immigration officers already operate on Eurostar trains from Belgium. On a wider issue, EU interior ministers approved Britain's request to join the Schengen information system, a Strasbourg-based database with over 14m records on fugitives, stolen vehicles and firearms. But Britain is staying outside the wider Schengen agreement, which loosened border controls between several EU states. Other EU states had been unhappy with this \u00e0 la carte approach, but reluctantly concluded that it was better to have Britain only partly in than completely outside - a solution which cannot be replicated over the bigger issue of the euro. The British government says the EU anti-crime convention is intended to cope with the growth of cross-border crime and make it easier to obtain evidence abroad for use in British courts. But there are worries that what began as judicial cooperation has ended with tighter operational coordination between unaccountable and self-regulating police and security forces. \"It's a massive extension of powers,\" warned Tony Bunyan of Statewatch, the civil liberties watchdog. \"If you don't define which crimes this applies to - say drug dealing or child pornography - those powers could easily be abused.\" Worries about the Schengen information system focus on a lack of adequate data-protection provisions and a limited scope for judicial review. Mr Straw sought to emphasise the positive aspects of the government's involvement in EU cooperation on crime, justice and home affairs. \"There are clear benefits to engaging with our European partners,\" he said. \"We have been able to protect our borders while joining in measures which will enable us better to tackle cross-border crime.\" He said later he had reassured colleagues that Britain's involvement in the Echelon surveillance system, a US-led economic espionage network, did not breach accepted EU standards on the interception of communications. Portugal, the current holder of the EU's rotating presidency, had raised concerns, originating in the European parliament, that Echelon's satellites and listening posts were being used to spy on European companies. \"All interception in the UK takes place under a strict legal framework,\" Mr Straw insisted. Officials said it would take about a year for the Anglo-French treaty on Eurostar checks to be ratified - too late to stop football hooligans heading to the Euro 2000 competition next month. But Mr Straw told BBC radio that the government would \"continue to look at whether it is possible, even at this late stage, to introduce emergency legislation to stop hooligans travelling\". The Belgian and Dutch governments, members of the Schengen border pact, confirmed that they would reinstate frontier controls for the duration of Euro 2000. A continent sans fronti\u00e8res \u0095Under the original 1985 Schengen pact, a group of European Union states agreed to the gradual abolition of border controls and new measures on cross-border policing.

      "bodyText": "The Post Office had cause for celebration last night after the European commission disclosed it had launched an investigation into claims that Germany's Deutsche Post is overcharging for certain letters sent from Britain and deliberately delaying their delivery. The move comes ahead of radical proposals due to be endorsed in Brussels today to liberalise substantially Europe's postal sector and gradually open it up to full competition by chipping away at monopoly providers. These proposals are likely to be less popular with the Royal Mail. The dispute between the Post Office and Deutsche Post raises serious questions, however, about how advanced competition in Europe really is. Postal charges in Germany are among the highest in Europe and have prompted companies based there to dispatch huge quantities of letters to Britain electronically or by other means where they are then remailed to Germany. The canny German and international firms concerned, mostly banks and credit card companies, are saving millions of pounds by doing this because international postal rates in Britain are considerably cheaper than German domestic rates. However, the Post Office, which is pulling down significant extra revenue as a result, claims that a disgruntled Deutsche Post has started hitting back by charging the full German price on such letters and deliberately holding them up to discourage the practice. This kind of behaviour must, it argues, be in breach of EU fair competition rules since Deutsche Post is clearly taking advantage of its dominant position. Brussels, which is already looking into claims that Deutsche Post is illegally cross-subsidising some of its commercial services, obviously suspects the German firm has at least a case to answer. \"We sent a letter to Deutsche Post last week asking it to respond to allegations made by the Post Office and others,\" an EC spokeswoman said. Although companies have complained about this issue before, this is the first time, she added, that a postal service from another member state has become involved. \"Among the allegations is that Deutsche Post is charging the full stamp price and delaying delivering letters with a view to damaging the practice of remailing,\" she said. The inquiry is a victory for proponents of liberalisation who were disappointed in February when the European Court of Justice ruled that Deutsche Post was perfectly in its rights to levy an extra charge for remailed letters, although not the full domestic price. Europe's \u00a353bn postal market is, in any case, due for an overhaul and the commission is expected to say today that EU-wide competition for letters weighing more than 50 grammes should be introduced from 2003 onwards. This would be certain to anger the Post Office which has argued strongly that the 350 gramme threshold should not be lowered beyond 150 grammes. In November Post Office chief executive John Roberts warned the commission not to go too far: \"There should not be 'a leap of faith' in making changes to monopolies otherwise there would be a threat to the continued provision of an affordable universal service ... with the inevitable risk of postage price rises and lower quality of service.\" The Post Office is already under pressure from the government to surrender part of its monopoly and under present plans would only retain exclusivity on letters and parcels under 50p compared to \u00a31 presently.

Dr Michael Crowe, a consultant psychiatrist and head of the couple and sexual clinic at London's Maudsley hospital believes the pharmaceutical solution is too simplistic: \"Women's sexuality is more complicated and multidimensional than men's.

We pretend to be aroused, or to reach orgasm and then find ourselves either having to live with a permanently unhappy sex life, or let the other person know.\" </p> <p>By this time, sex has usually become fraught or non-existent and the relationship is under severe strain. The realization of the scale of female dissatisfaction has galvanised drug companies.

Dr Riley says: \"It's a new field, but everyone is racing to catch up.\" </p> <p>There are many different drugs in development, but research can be roughly divided into two areas: hormone treatments (usually oestrogen, testosterone, or a combination of both, administered by injection, pill, patch or cream) and \"vasodilators\" (drugs like Viagra, that dilate blood vessels and increase blood flow to the genitals). </p> <p>This month the US food and drug administration approved a device optimistically named \"Eros\" - a vacuum pump that increases the blood supply to the clitoris. The next wave of treatments, says Dr Martin Cole, the recently retired head of the sex education institute in Birmingham, is based around the brain chemicals of seratonin, dopamine and drenaline. </p> <p>\"Once we fully understand the role of the brain chemicals in arousal and response,\" says Cole, \"we'll have some amazing treatments.\" But maybe medication is missing the point. \"Sometimes, people just do stop fancying each other,\" Cole suggests. \"The best sex therapy under those circumstances might be to point out that sex is just one part of a relationship jigsaw, and it doesn't have to be the most important part.\" After all, if nearly half of us don't like sex, then FSD is almost normal, isn't it?

      "body": "<p><strong> Scar tissue</strong></p> <p> <strong> Q </strong>A few years ago I had a nasty cyst removed from my chest - just above where my cleavage would start, if I had one. The small operation to cut out the cyst went well but I was left with a horrible heaped up scar which my GP said is called keloid. I've been told that any treatment to remove it may result in worse scarring. Is there really nothing to be done?</p> <p> <strong> A</strong> Keloid is an inherited tendency to overhealing of cuts. When wounds heal you produce too much fibrous tissue, causing raised scars that can itch or be uncomfortable. Treatments include injecting steroid into the scar, laser, pressure, or freezing with liquid nitrogen. None is guaranteed to work and nearly half of the scars will recur.</p> <p>There are great hopes for a newer treatment using sheets of silicone gel (Cics-Care), which is like sticky-back plastic as featured on Blue Peter in the late 60s and can be bought over the counter. It probably works by sealing moisture into the scar, which makes it flatter and softer. Cut the self-adhesive sheet to fit the scar. Stick it on and leave for four hours a day, building up to 24 hours as soon as you can. Each piece can be left on for up to a month, though it should be cleaned twice a day. Continue treatment for two to four months.</p> <p>For further advice contact the Scar Information Service (0845 120 0022).</p> <p> <strong> Eczema distress</strong></p> <p> <strong>Q</strong> I've developed the most irritating dermatitis on my hands. They're so dry, red and itchy that I'm constantly clawing away at them and they have developed weeping blisters on their backs that my GP said was infection from all the scratching. That calmed down with antibiotics but my hands are still so painful sometimes that I can hardly hold a cup. I use a strong steroid cream (Betnovate) but it doesn't seem to help any more. Any ideas? </p> <p> <strong> A</strong> Dermatitis (or eczema - two different words for the same thing) is dry, irritated, itchy skin. When confined to the hands, it's almost always because you're in contact with something that your skin is sensitive to.</p> <p>Common culprits are water, chemicals and rubber. I had one patient who developed awful skin rashes on his hands when he switched jobs to work as a technician in a hospital medical unit. Allergy testing (injecting tiny amounts of substances just under his skin, then noting the reaction) showed he was allergic to a cleansing solution used for the medical instruments. Wearing rubber gloves didn't help - he was allergic to rubber too. PVC gloves helped a bit, but ultimately he moved to a different <br> department and his hands healed. Try avoiding water and corrosive chemicals, and wear PVC not rubber gloves. But if it persists, why not ask to be referred for allergy testing?</p> <p><strong> Does he need more iron?</strong></p> <p> <strong> Q </strong>My toddler's a poor eater and never eats meat. Does he need iron supplements?</p> <p> <strong> A</strong> If your son has lots of energy, seems well and looks around the same size as other kids his age, he's probably getting enough iron. Only a blood test will confirm whether or not he lacks iron and it may be worth requesting if you're concerned about his growth or development.</p> <p>Your health visitor can give specific advice about iron-rich foods - red meat's got lots but broccoli and dried apricots have some too and may be more acceptable to him. Avoid tea with meals as it binds to iron and prevents its absorption. Giving iron supplements to non-deficient children is potentially harmful and can slow their growth. Drops containing vitamins A, C and D for children aged one to five are a good idea while he's faddy with food. Vitamin C will help him absorb more iron from Hula Hoops and Ribena while you keep plugging the meat and two veg.</p> <p><strong> Will I get my hair back?</strong></p> <p> <strong> Q </strong>I had a bad nervous breakdown last year from which I've made a slow but steady recovery.

      "bodyText": "Scar tissue Q A few years ago I had a nasty cyst removed from my chest - just above where my cleavage would start, if I had one. The small operation to cut out the cyst went well but I was left with a horrible heaped up scar which my GP said is called keloid. I've been told that any treatment to remove it may result in worse scarring. Is there really nothing to be done? A Keloid is an inherited tendency to overhealing of cuts. When wounds heal you produce too much fibrous tissue, causing raised scars that can itch or be uncomfortable. Treatments include injecting steroid into the scar, laser, pressure, or freezing with liquid nitrogen. None is guaranteed to work and nearly half of the scars will recur. There are great hopes for a newer treatment using sheets of silicone gel (Cics-Care), which is like sticky-back plastic as featured on Blue Peter in the late 60s and can be bought over the counter. It probably works by sealing moisture into the scar, which makes it flatter and softer. Cut the self-adhesive sheet to fit the scar. Stick it on and leave for four hours a day, building up to 24 hours as soon as you can. Each piece can be left on for up to a month, though it should be cleaned twice a day. Continue treatment for two to four months. For further advice contact the Scar Information Service (0845 120 0022). Eczema distress Q I've developed the most irritating dermatitis on my hands. They're so dry, red and itchy that I'm constantly clawing away at them and they have developed weeping blisters on their backs that my GP said was infection from all the scratching. That calmed down with antibiotics but my hands are still so painful sometimes that I can hardly hold a cup. I use a strong steroid cream (Betnovate) but it doesn't seem to help any more. Any ideas? A Dermatitis (or eczema - two different words for the same thing) is dry, irritated, itchy skin. When confined to the hands, it's almost always because you're in contact with something that your skin is sensitive to. Common culprits are water, chemicals and rubber. I had one patient who developed awful skin rashes on his hands when he switched jobs to work as a technician in a hospital medical unit. Allergy testing (injecting tiny amounts of substances just under his skin, then noting the reaction) showed he was allergic to a cleansing solution used for the medical instruments. Wearing rubber gloves didn't help - he was allergic to rubber too. PVC gloves helped a bit, but ultimately he moved to a different department and his hands healed. Try avoiding water and corrosive chemicals, and wear PVC not rubber gloves. But if it persists, why not ask to be referred for allergy testing? Does he need more iron? Q My toddler's a poor eater and never eats meat. Does he need iron supplements? A If your son has lots of energy, seems well and looks around the same size as other kids his age, he's probably getting enough iron. Only a blood test will confirm whether or not he lacks iron and it may be worth requesting if you're concerned about his growth or development. Your health visitor can give specific advice about iron-rich foods - red meat's got lots but broccoli and dried apricots have some too and may be more acceptable to him. Avoid tea with meals as it binds to iron and prevents its absorption. Giving iron supplements to non-deficient children is potentially harmful and can slow their growth. Drops containing vitamins A, C and D for children aged one to five are a good idea while he's faddy with food. Vitamin C will help him absorb more iron from Hula Hoops and Ribena while you keep plugging the meat and two veg. Will I get my hair back? Q I had a bad nervous breakdown last year from which I've made a slow but steady recovery. Though I'm only 37, my hair went from thick dark brown with a few grey hairs, to sparse white hair like an old man. Will it ever return to its former colour and texture? A It's great to hear that you've made such a good recovery. Any severe stress, physical or mental, can make your hair fall out. Coloured hairs, like your brown ones, are shed first whereas the white hairs are sturdier and less likely to fall out. So, seemingly overnight, your hair goes from looking predominantly brown, to white. The good news is that hair often grows again and with any luck it will be brown not white.",

They hooked up again last year and things just, um, blasted off. </p> <p> <strong> Do say:</strong> \"Beam me up, Scotty\" </p> <p> <strong> Not to be confused with:</strong> Scott of the Antarctic; Scott off Neighbours; Buzz Aldrin.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Age: 67. Official title: Colonel. Former employer: Nasa. Appearance: Stocky, with a strangely bulbous head. Oh, hang on - that's a spacesuit. Claim to fame: Until yesterday, Col Scott's most bankable dinner-party anecdotes were his 1971 moonwalk as commander of Apollo 15, and his 1966 mission alongside Neil Armstrong to carry out the first link-up between two spacecraft. It doesn't get much better than that. Few things, it's true, can rival a leisurely afternoon stroll along the final frontier. But he's discovered one. He's discovered the secret of life itself? Or invented time travel? Even better than that. Col Scott has sabotaged the pathetic fantasies of a million pub bores by winning the heart of that paragon of newsreaderly poise, Anna Ford. One small step for man, one giant poke in the eye for lots of other middle-aged men? Precisely. The two announced yesterday that they plan to marry. Quite a catch. Let's not forget that Ford was labelled the most beautiful woman in the world by no other touchstone of aesthetic wisdom than Mr Peter Jay himself. Auberon Waugh reportedly said the sight of her made him kiss the screen of his television, but don't linger on that image. I mean, marrying an astronaut is quite a catch. That too: this certainly looks like a match made in heaven. Or on the far side of the stratosphere, at any rate. And they're over the moon, I suppose. \"David and I are together and very happy and we want to spend our future together,\" Ford says. Still, it's an unlikely pairing. TVam's most talented wine-thrower first met her rocket man when he was ITN's space adviser and she a newsreader there. They hooked up again last year and things just, um, blasted off. Do say: \"Beam me up, Scotty\" Not to be confused with: Scott of the Antarctic; Scott off Neighbours; Buzz Aldrin.",

      "bodyText": "John Prescott today launched Labour's pre-election onslaught on its own heartlands, unveiling a \u00a328bn package of spending plans themed with the words Opportunity For All. The slogan is likely to be repeated endlessly in the coming months, as the government moves to shore up support in traditional Labour strongholds, and in the more precariously held areas captured from the Conservatives in 1997. The deputy prime minister's speech ranged far beyond his sprawling responsibilities as minister in charge of the environment, transport and the regions. Outlining Chancellor Gordon Brown's forthcoming comprehensive spending review, Mr Prescott said the government's mission was to deliver opportunity and security in a changing world. \"That is what we're all about, about giving to the majority of people the life chances taken for granted by the privileged few,\" he said. Mr Prescott, who clearly relishes standing in for Tony Blair while the prime minister is on temporary child-minding duties, launched a withering attack on Tory promises of increased pensions. He also made a spirited grab for headlines by reopening the controversy over Oxbridge elitism. Labour ministers believe they are on to a winner over the case of Newcastle school leaver Laura Spence, eagerly accepted by Harvard University after being turned down by Oxford. Now the government is working on a modest package of incentives for Oxbridge colleges to increase their intake of state school pupils. \"Nobody should be surprised if the spending review widens opportunity in our universities, or provides the resources for schools to combat underachievement, wherever it may exist, in the heartlands or middle England,\" said Mr Prescott.

After three mediocre knocks at the end of April, a big score against the Zimbabweans saw him click into gear, and he followed that up with over 100 runs in the Championship at The Oval a week later.

      "bodyText": "GOOD FORM Rahul Dravid Kent As the weather begins to warms up, so too does Dravid's bat. After three mediocre knocks at the end of April, a big score against the Zimbabweans saw him click into gear, and he followed that up with over 100 runs in the Championship at The Oval a week later. With three not-outs to his name, his average in all competitions is fractionally short of 100 - not quite challenging Michael Bevan at the top of the overseas players league, but a sound investment by Kent nonetheless. At a glance 23, 27, 17*, 31*, 182, 44*, 71, 10 In detail 23 v Essex, B&amp;H, Canterbury 27 v Middx, B&amp;H, Canterbury 17* v Lancs, PPP Ch'ship Div 1 , Canterbury 31* v Northants, NUL Div 1, Canterbury 182 v Zimbabweans, Canterbury 44* and 71 v Surrey, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, The Oval 10 v Leics, NUL Div 1, Leicester First-class runs 314 at 157.00 One-day runs 91 at 30.33 Total runs 405 at 81.00 BAD FORM John Crawley Lancashire John Crawley started the season with a bang - but has been on a slippery slope ever since. After scoring 232 runs in his first three innings, the Lancashire captain must have thought a prodigious summer lay ahead. But then mediocrity struck and, as April turned to May, he hit seriously bad form. Crawley is averaging 23.42 in all cricket for the season, but we've highlighted the difference between his averages for April and May. At a glance 126, 61, 45, 20, 12, 16, 1, 1, 1, 5, 7, 33, 0 In detail 126 v Cambridge U, Fenner's 61 v Notts, B&amp;H, Manchester 45 v Yorks, B&amp;H, Leeds 20 v Durham, B&amp;H, Chester-le-Street 12 v Derbyshire, B&amp;H, Derby 16 v Leics, B&amp;H, Manchester 1 v Leics, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, Manchester 1 v Leics, NUL Div 1, Manchester 1 v Durham, B&amp;H Q-F, Manchester 5 and 7 v Durham, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, Chester-le-Street 33 v Hants, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, Southampton 0 v Gloucs, B&amp;H S-F, Bristol All runs in April 280 at 46.67 All runs in May 48 at 6.85 GOOD FORM Chris Schofield Lancashire and England Schofield, 21, the only man with an England Test contract but no caps, has had a season of two halves. In Lancashire's first five matches, he played only against Cambridge. Then, despite having only played two county one-day matches before this season, he got into the team for the final B&amp;H group game and has been almost ever-present, getting runs as well as wickets. At a glance 1-14 and 5-48, 36; 3-33 and 16; 34; 0-47 and 4-82, 66; 4-34, 3; 0-2, 50, 18; 0; 39*, 1-42; 0-37 and 23 In detail 1-14 and 5-48, 36 v Cambridge Univ., Fenner's 3-33and16 v Leics, B&amp;H, Old Trafford 34 v Kent, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, Canterbury 0-47 and 4-82, 66 v Leics, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, Old Trafford 4-34 and 3 v Durham, B&amp;H Q-F, Old Trafford 0-2, 50 and 18 v Durham, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, Riverside 0 v Zimbabwe, first Test, Lord's 39* and 1-42 v Hampshire, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, Southampton 0-37 and 23 v Gloucs, B&amp;H S-F, Bristol First-class runs 243 at 40.5 One-day runs 42 at 14.00 Total runs 246 at 27.33 First-class wickets 11 at 21.36 One-day wickets 7 at 14.85 Total wickets 18 at 18.83 BAD FORM Graham Thorpe Surrey Thorpe, who opted out of England's tour to South Africa, should have been hungry for runs after a relaxing winter. But with just one fifty to his name so far, he's finding it difficult to get back in the swing of things: he scored just one run in three innings before making 11 against Kent. Thorpe missed out on a central contract for the summer, and his poor run of form meant he was not chosen for the England side to play Zimbabwe in the first Test. At a glance 16; 0; 61; 18 and 1; 0; 0; 11; 3; 21; 14* In detail 16 v Hants, B&amp;H, The Oval 0 v Somerset, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, Taunton 61 v Glamorgan, NUL Div 2, Cardiff 18 and 1 v Durham, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, Riverside 0 v Durham, NUL Div 2, Riverside 0 v Yorkshire, B&amp;H Q-F, Headingley 11 v Kent, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, The Oval 3 v Kent, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, Canterbury 21 v Glamorgan, B&amp;H S-F, Cardiff 14* v Hampshire, NUL Div 2, The Oval First-class runs 33 at 6.60 One-day runs 112 at 22.40 Total runs 145 at 14.50 GOOD FORM Michael Bevan Sussex Officially the world's best one-day batsman, Bevan has taken the South Coast by storm. His limited-overs form has been outstanding this season. At one point his average in all competitions stood at a hefty 320. Now it's a mere 71.33. At a glance 65*; 157*; 46; 52*; 59; 71; 30 and 36; 49*; 41 and 26; 10 In detail 65* v Hants, B&amp;H, Hove 157* v Essex, B&amp;H, Chelmsford 46 v Gloucs, PPP Ch'ship Div 2, Bristol 52* v Gloucs, NUL Div 1, Bristol 59 v Leics, NUL Div 1, Leicester 71 v Gloucs, B&amp;H Q-F, Hove 30 and 36 v Warwicks, PPP Ch'ship Div 2, Hove 49* v Worcs, NUL Div 1, Hove 41 and 26 v Worcs, PPP Ch'ship Div 2, Hove 10 v Essex, PPP Ch'ship Div 2, Chelmsford First-class runs 189 at 27.00 One-day runs 453 at 226.50 Total runs 642 at 71.33 BAD FORM Darren Maddy Leicestershire Maddy had everything to prove for after a disappointing time in South Africa. But he didn't make double-figures until his sixth innings, and only moved past 100 runs for the season in his 11th. At least that effort was 39 steps in the right direction and now, in the current match at Chester-le-Street, he has at last found the form to score a half-century. At a glance 8; 1; 0; 2; 4; 24; 6 and 18; 16; 5 and 39; 22;2; 50 In detail 8 v Derbys, B&amp;H, Derby 1 v Durham, B&amp;H, Leicester 0 v Yorks, B&amp;H, Headingley 2 v Lancs, B&amp;H, Old Trafford 4 v Derbys, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, Derby 24 v Sussex, NUL Div 1, Leicester 6 and 18 v Lancs, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, Old Trafford 16 v Lancs, NUL Div 1, Old Trafford 5 and 39 v Somerset, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, Leicester 22 v Hants, PPP Ch'ship Div 1, Leicester 2 v Kent, NUL Div 1, Leicester 50 v Durham, Ch'ship Div 1, Chester-le-Street First-class runs 144 at 20.57 One-day runs 53 at 7.57 Total runs 197 at 14.07 Note First-class matches in roman, one-day games in italics",

The allegedly shoddy bust by German artist Julia Erbe was scrutinised by experts who refused to grant approval for it to be erected as a work of art. The residents' association that set up the bust on Sodermalm Island, where the actress was born in 1905, has said it will fight the order in court.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Stockholm's arts authority have ordered that a bust of Greta Garbo be removed from a city park, claiming that the bronze likeness was not good enough for public display. The allegedly shoddy bust by German artist Julia Erbe was scrutinised by experts who refused to grant approval for it to be erected as a work of art. The residents' association that set up the bust on Sodermalm Island, where the actress was born in 1905, has said it will fight the order in court. In the meantime, the bust will be mothballed out of sight - a fitting fate for an actress who famously longed to be alone. \u0095 Mission: Impossible 2 has defied its reviewers and gone straight in at number one at the US box office when it opened over the Memorial Day weekend (see Friday's report). Official figures show the film, released on a record 3,653 screens, has reaped an estimated $88m. Disney's Dinosaur was pushed into second place with $18m, while Jackie Chan's comic Wild West foray, Shanghai Noon, rustled up an estimated $16m.

      "bodyText": "The former Indonesian dictator Suharto was put under house arrest yesterday to speed up the investigation of his alleged corruption and placate mounting public anger with President Abdurrahman Wahid at the slow pace of the inquiry. His detention coincides with rising sectarian tension, which is thought to be part of a concerted campaign to discredit Mr Wahid and provide an excuse to oust him at a special session of parliament in August. Mr Suharto's status has been changed from city arrest to house arrest for two weeks \"to ensure a conducive environment for the corruption investigation and also taking into account his poor health\", the attorney general's office said. Prosecutors hope to put Mr Suharto, 78, on trial by the middle of August, charged with embezzling billions of pounds during his 32 years in power until he was toppled by a student-led reform movement in May 1998. Their investigation is being hampered by his deteriorating health. He suffered a stroke last year and was in hospital with intestinal trouble. His lawyers and family say he has difficulty talking and is losing his memory. Doctors have had to halt many recent questioning sessions because his blood pressure started rising suddenly. Yesterday's move is seen mainly as a sop to the increasingly militant student-led protests demanding an immediate trial. Police and demonstrators regularly engage in running battles near Mr Suharto's home in central Jakarta. On Friday parts of Jakarta were reduced to chaos as hundreds of people attacked police stations and burned passing army vehicles. The police did nothing, saying they did not want to provoke total disorder. On Sunday a nail bomb exploded in a packed church in Medan, Indonesia's third biggest city, injuring several dozen people in the congregation. The timer failed in another bomb in the city's largest church, and the police found a third bomb during a sweep of all the city's places of worship. A fourth bomb exploded in a restaurant early yesterday, injuring four people. Religious leaders and government officials said they were intended to foment sectarian violence between Muslims and Christians. Almost 90% of Indonesia's 210m people follow Islam. In the past fortnight the sectarian conflict which began in the eastern Moluccas 18 months ago has reached a new level of intensity with the arrival of 2,000 Muslims proclaiming a holy war against Christians. They have made several attacks in the region, in which more than 70 people have died. Christians and Muslims have been fighting in Poso, central Sulawesi, for the past week. The police say the clashes are spreading to neighbouring districts. Hasyim Muzadi, chairman of Indonesia's biggest Muslim organisation, Nahdlatul Ulama, said the sectarian tension was a \"systematic and well coordinated\" attempt to undermine Mr Wahid. \"A series of troubles and now an explosion in a church in Medan will eventually lead to an attempt to topple the government,\" he said. Despite having no concrete evidence, most people blame Mr Suharto, his family and cronies for the tension. \"They are bitter about what is happening to the old man and are bitter because they are no longer in power,\" an official in the presidential palace said. Most people believe that Mr Wahid's position is currently secure but that a lot can happen in the 10 weeks before the special parliamentary session. Mr Wahid is not helping himself, however. He is seen as failing to see through much-needed economic reforms and appointing friends and family to influential positions. The Jakarta stock market fell to a one-year low yesterday because of the the growing concern, and the currency fell more than 3%.",

      "trailText": "Almost two weeks after George Speight took the entire government hostage, efforts are still going on to resolve the political crisis. We explain Fiji's descent into political turmoil.",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>What is the latest in the crisis?</b> <br> The country's military leaders, who declared martial law yesterday, have named Ratu Epeli Nailatikau as interim prime minister. In a small country where everyone knows everybody else, Mr Nailatikau's wife, Adi Koila Mara, the tourism minister, is one of the 30 hostages held by Mr Speight since the May 19 coup. <p> <b>What are Mr Speight's demands?</b><br> What rankled Mr Speight was the fact that Fiji's prime minister is Mahendra Chaudhry, the first ethnic Indian to hold the post. In other demands, Mr Speight sought the resignation of Rau Sir Kamisese Mara, who was considered too soft towards the Indian minority, the appointment of an indigenous government, and a new constitution allowing only Fijians to hold the posts of prime minister and president. Mr Chaudhry was sacked by president Mara last week, who now remains on a Fijian navy off-shore patrol boat. </p> <p> <b>Who is George Speight?</b><br> He is essentially a businessman but is also the son of an opposition MP, Sam Speight. His father, a senior government member and an architect of the 1987 coup, was brought to power on the coat-tails of Sitiveni Rabuka, whose administration lost power a year ago. Mr Speight was chairman of two Fijian firms involved in the country's lucrative $60m mahogany timber trade. Mr Speight was sacked by Mr Chaudhry after last years landslide victory over Mr Rabuka.</p> <p><b>Is there anyone behind Mr Speight?</b><br> Mr Speight always seemed a rather implausible coup leader, and sure enough reports emerged today that the real coup leader is a former special services soldier loyal to former prime minister Rabuka. APF, the French news agency, has reported that the actual leader is Colonel Ilisoni Ligairi, 60, who received training in the UK. He is in charge of the counter revolutionary warfare unit (CRWU) which Mr Speight used to seize Fiji's parliament. The CRWU, considered Fiji's version of the Special Air Service, frequently operates with special forces from Britain, Australia and New Zealand.</p> <p><b>Has there been any violence?</b><br> On Sunday, Mr Speight's supporters smashed up the local TV station, forcing it off the air, and surrounded the Centra hotel, where most foreign journalists covering the coup were staying.

      "bodyText": "What is the latest in the crisis? The country's military leaders, who declared martial law yesterday, have named Ratu Epeli Nailatikau as interim prime minister. In a small country where everyone knows everybody else, Mr Nailatikau's wife, Adi Koila Mara, the tourism minister, is one of the 30 hostages held by Mr Speight since the May 19 coup. What are Mr Speight's demands? What rankled Mr Speight was the fact that Fiji's prime minister is Mahendra Chaudhry, the first ethnic Indian to hold the post. In other demands, Mr Speight sought the resignation of Rau Sir Kamisese Mara, who was considered too soft towards the Indian minority, the appointment of an indigenous government, and a new constitution allowing only Fijians to hold the posts of prime minister and president. Mr Chaudhry was sacked by president Mara last week, who now remains on a Fijian navy off-shore patrol boat. Who is George Speight? He is essentially a businessman but is also the son of an opposition MP, Sam Speight. His father, a senior government member and an architect of the 1987 coup, was brought to power on the coat-tails of Sitiveni Rabuka, whose administration lost power a year ago. Mr Speight was chairman of two Fijian firms involved in the country's lucrative $60m mahogany timber trade. Mr Speight was sacked by Mr Chaudhry after last years landslide victory over Mr Rabuka. Is there anyone behind Mr Speight? Mr Speight always seemed a rather implausible coup leader, and sure enough reports emerged today that the real coup leader is a former special services soldier loyal to former prime minister Rabuka. APF, the French news agency, has reported that the actual leader is Colonel Ilisoni Ligairi, 60, who received training in the UK. He is in charge of the counter revolutionary warfare unit (CRWU) which Mr Speight used to seize Fiji's parliament. The CRWU, considered Fiji's version of the Special Air Service, frequently operates with special forces from Britain, Australia and New Zealand. Has there been any violence? On Sunday, Mr Speight's supporters smashed up the local TV station, forcing it off the air, and surrounded the Centra hotel, where most foreign journalists covering the coup were staying. One policeman was shot dead, prompting the army to declare martial law. Didn't analysts think the coup was going to peter out quickly? That was the initial thinking. But the longer the coup went on, the more support Mr Speight received from the Fijian population until Fiji's traditional chiefs eventually gave their blessing to the coup, calling for Mr Chaudhry to be replaced by an indigenous Fijian. The chiefs, who wield enormous influence, agreed to all of Mr Speight's demands, including a pardon for all those involved in the coup. What will be the effect on the island's Indian population?

By 1970, when Fiji became independent, ethnic Indians were in a majority.

Not only do they make it far easier to decipher what is going off out there but they also allow you to keep a close eye on that really rather cute fielder. And don't worry about being labelled a sexist. When cricketers sit on the dressing room balcony with binoculars glued to their eyes, they aren't looking for their grandmothers. </p> <p><strong> 2.</strong> Don't wash your hair. There is absolutely no need to put on any make-up or make any sort of effort whatsoever in order to attend a cricket match. If it looks like it is going to rain, pack that anorak - with pride.</p> <p><strong> 3.</strong> If on the other hand you want to be a screen starlet, and it looks like the sun will shine, wear a bikini top. Cameramen (they usually are men) are suckers for expansive bosoms so you will be beamed live into a million homes. Oh and if you streak, <em>The Sun</em> will offer you a lot of money to pose on page three.</p> <p><strong> 4.</strong> If going to a Test match take a walkman and tune into Test Match Special (Radio 4, 198 LW) as soon as you arrive. Friendly voices will give you an idea of what is going on and entertain you when it rains. They will also point you in the direction of the man dressed as a carrot.</p> <p><strong> 5.</strong> Bring a Thermos flask of coffee. Cricket grounds sell lousy stuff: Nescafe, if you're lucky; bog-brush turds if you're not.</p> <p><strong> 6.</strong> Carry a newspaper, or two, or a beach bonkbuster. The joy of cricket is that you can drift in and out of the game as you fancy. No-one, except perhaps Bob Woolmer and his computerised companion, pays attention to every single ball of a match. In fact, at any given moment probably a quarter of the crowd is asleep.</p> <p><strong> 7.</strong> Wear sunglasses. Essential for the usual reasons and also useful for staring - has that woman really got a moustache? - or pretending to have dozed off when the man you are sitting next to reveals his \"really interesting\" theory on the Duckworth/Lewis method. </p> <p><strong> 8.</strong> Keep an eye on the scoreboard. If someone has 48 or 98 try not to go to the loo. You are guaranteed to miss something vital when you do go, but at least this way you are cutting your losses. </p> <p><strong>9.</strong> Wear something with an elasticated waistband (see tip 2). You will be amazed at just how much one woman can consume in seven sedentary hours. Pork pies, quiches, salmon, chips, cake, strawberries, doughnuts and crisps make for tasty hors d'oeuvres. </p> <p><strong>10.</strong> Enjoy. This is the most wonderful game in the world. And even if you hate every horrible second of it you can always get darling Rupert out on video as soon as you've bowled home.</p> <p> <em>Tanya Aldred is assistant editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

Was mich davon \u00fcberzeugt hat, da\u00df es Gott gibt, ist einfach zu erkl\u00e4ren: ich erlebe es jedesmal im Gottesdienst und auch im t\u00e4glichen Leben. Das ist kaum in Worte zu fassen, ich denke, man mu\u00df es sp\u00fcren. Wenn ich Gott zum Beispiel im Gebet um etwas bitte, dann merke ich, da\u00df ich Hilfe bekomme. Das bedeutet nat\u00fcrlich nicht, da\u00df ich gleich einen Sechser im Lotto habe, nur weil ich Gott zum Beispiel bei einem finanziellen Engpa\u00df um Hilfe gebeten habe. Die Hilfe ist anderer Art, nicht nur auf das Materielle ausgerichtet. Aber sie ist doch da. Man ist aber auch immer selbst gefordert, diese Beziehung zu Gott aufrecht zu erhalten. Das ist wie mit dem Verh\u00e4ltnis zu Vater, Mutter oder meiner Freundin. Man mu\u00df diese Liebe pflegen, aber man wei\u00df: du bist nie allein. Ich bin froh, da\u00df auch in der heutigen Zeit viele so denken. Bei Jugendtagen der Neuapostolischen Kirche erlebt man in einer Menge von vier- oder f\u00fcnftausend jungen, ganz unterschiedlichen Menschen, wie sie der Glaube an Gott verbindet. Sie verfolgen ja alle das gleiche Ziel: Bei der R\u00fcckkehr von Jesus dabei zu sein. Das bedeutet nat\u00fcrlich nicht, da\u00df ich irgendwie lebensm\u00fcde w\u00e4re. Im Gegenteil. Erfolg und Freude sind mir auch wichtig. Aber ich ordne sie diesem wichtigsten Ziel unter. Be\u00e4ngstigend finde ich, da\u00df immer mehr junge Menschen aus den christlichen Kirchen austreten, weil sie nichts von Gott wissen wollen. In meinem Glauben ist das zum Gl\u00fcck anders.

The military took action after two soldiers and a journalist were injured by gunfire on Saturday and a policeman was killed on Sunday night when a mob ran through Suva and ransacked the state-owned television station. On Saturday, Commodore Bainamarama said that 15 unarmed reservists who joined Mr Speight's men last Friday would be discharged. Rodney Joyce is a Reuters correspondent.",

Mr Haider, who is governor of Carinthia and has used it as a powerbase from which his populist Freedom party (FPO) made the leap into government in February, said that petrol and diesel would be sold at 12% less than the average price elsewhere in Austria. Last week it was confirmed that he had held business talks in Tripoli with Colonel Muammar Gadafy. Mr Haider is a friend of the Libyan leader's son. The cut price fuel would go on sale at midnight last night, Mr Haider said, but refused to say where it had come from, how much had been secured and at what price. A local discount chain has been signed up to distribute the fuel. After a general election in October last year Mr Haider threw Austria into chaos when the Freedom party entered a coalition government with the conservative People's party under the chancellorship of Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel. In protest the other 14 members of the EU imposed bilateral sanctions, which they have said will remain in place while the Freedom party is in government. Mr Haider later resigned as leader of the FPO, following the deluge of criticism. Opposition politicians and political analysts last night said the cheap fuel deal was yet another attempt by Austria's most controversial leader since world war two to strengthen the FPO's popularity ratings. His major trump card in the run up to the election last year was his pledge to provide a substantial monthly \"children's cheque\" to Austrian nationals. The petrol deal is seen in a similar light. It is said to be a further example of Mr Haider's knack of tapping into the national psyche. Soaring petrol prices caused by higher global crude oil prices have led to widespread calls for politicians to intervene. At a press conference in the Carinthian capital, Klagenfurt, yesterday, he remained cagey about the deal but said that he hoped the main petrol suppliers would match the low prices. If not, he said he would be forced to open petrol stations to the public that are normally used only by official vehicles, and which charge lower prices. Earlier, Austria's economics minister, Martin Bartenstein, warned the major oil companies that unless they imposed price cuts by the end of May he would enforce price controls. Mr Haider, known for his controversial remarks downplaying the crimes of Nazis, has drawn further international criticism recently by suggesting that Austrian politicians who criticise the government abroad should be put on trial. The petrol deal comes after confirmed reports that Mr Haider held meetings earlier this month with Colonel Gadafy. The Libyan leader's son, Saifalislam, who became a close friend of Mr Haider while studying in Vienna, where the son graduated earlier this year, said the two men had come together to \"discuss business\". Their meeting, he said, focused on the timber and tourism industries. \"J\u00f6rg Haider is a very good friend of mine, my father's and of our country,\" the magazine News quoted Saifalislam as saying. He insisted that Mr Haider had refused to accept political donations from Libya.

He was shot in a pub in Dunmurry, just outside south Belfast, on Sunday evening.</p> <p>Senior IRA figures are believed to have threatened Mr McCoy, a father-of-one, with assassination last year over his drug-dealing activities. He left his home, close to Dunmurry, soon afterwards, but is thought recently to have returned to the area, close to republican west Belfast.</p> <p>Police, who rejected a sectarian motive, believed the murder was drugs-related. They were unable to say who was responsible, but refused to rule out terrorist involvement.</p> <p>Hugh Lewsley, SDLP councillor in nearby Twinbrook, in west Belfast, said he was convinced that the IRA was responsible. So was Vincent McKenna, director of the Human Rights Bureau.</p> <p>But the burned out car used in the attack was found in Derriaghy, a loyalist area, and police are also investigating whether Mr McCoy was a victim of a gangland feud.</p> <p>The IRA is thought to have been been responsible for five other murders in Northern Ireland since the Good Friday agreement was sealed two years ago, three of them drugs-related. It is also suspected of five killings in the Irish Republic, all connected to the drugs trade.</p> <p>As unionists, both supporters and opponents of the agreement, called on Sir Ronnie Flanagan, RUC chief constable, to clarify who was responsible, David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, was left in a difficult position. He said it was too early to comment.</p> <p>Mr McCoy died 12 hours after he was shot in the Mott'n'Bailey bar. Two men, one disguised in a wig and false moustache, burst into the bar and singled him out.</p> <p>Mr Trimble criticised the on-going loyalist feud yesterday. Ulster Volunteer Force members are suspected of firing about 30 shots at the home of an alleged Loyalist Volunteer Force member in Ballgowan, Co Down. Mr Trimble said: \"This underlines the need for decommissioning and underlines the responsibility for mainstream loyalist paramilitaries to address that issue.\"</p> <p>Yesterday's apprehension, more acute than in November, when the euphoria of a power-sharing executive for the first time in 25 years temporarily outweighed nagging doubts, was fuelled further as the Irish police held seven more republican dissidents. They have been gaining strength since the IRA's offer two weeks ago to put arms beyond use.</p> <p>Gardai had earlier released eight members of the Real IRA held last week. They included the former IRA quartermaster, the leader of the Real IRA, the group behind the Omagh car bombing which killed 29 people in August 1998.</p> <p>Mr Trimble was back at Parliament Buildings, Stormont, to begin restoring relations with Seamus Mallon, deputy first minister. He confirmed there would be talks soon on the controversial flags issue. The 12-member executive is due to meet on Thursday. It is understood Friday is a designated day for flying the Union Flag over government buildings.</p> <p>Mr Trimble hoped the Rubicon had been crossed. If the IRA fulfilled its commitment and allowed weapons inspectors to look at some of its arms dumps, it would alleviate Ulster Unionist worries. The party's ruling council on Saturday backed a return to devolution by 53 to 47%.</p> <p>Mr Mallon hoped General John de Chastelain, chairman of the decommissioning body, would be able to issue a positive statement by the end of June.</p>",

But the burned out car used in the attack was found in Derriaghy, a loyalist area, and police are also investigating whether Mr McCoy was a victim of a gangland feud. The IRA is thought to have been been responsible for five other murders in Northern Ireland since the Good Friday agreement was sealed two years ago, three of them drugs-related. It is also suspected of five killings in the Irish Republic, all connected to the drugs trade. As unionists, both supporters and opponents of the agreement, called on Sir Ronnie Flanagan, RUC chief constable, to clarify who was responsible, David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, was left in a difficult position. He said it was too early to comment. Mr McCoy died 12 hours after he was shot in the Mott'n'Bailey bar. Two men, one disguised in a wig and false moustache, burst into the bar and singled him out. Mr Trimble criticised the on-going loyalist feud yesterday. Ulster Volunteer Force members are suspected of firing about 30 shots at the home of an alleged Loyalist Volunteer Force member in Ballgowan, Co Down. Mr Trimble said: \"This underlines the need for decommissioning and underlines the responsibility for mainstream loyalist paramilitaries to address that issue.\" Yesterday's apprehension, more acute than in November, when the euphoria of a power-sharing executive for the first time in 25 years temporarily outweighed nagging doubts, was fuelled further as the Irish police held seven more republican dissidents. They have been gaining strength since the IRA's offer two weeks ago to put arms beyond use. Gardai had earlier released eight members of the Real IRA held last week. They included the former IRA quartermaster, the leader of the Real IRA, the group behind the Omagh car bombing which killed 29 people in August 1998. Mr Trimble was back at Parliament Buildings, Stormont, to begin restoring relations with Seamus Mallon, deputy first minister. He confirmed there would be talks soon on the controversial flags issue. The 12-member executive is due to meet on Thursday. It is understood Friday is a designated day for flying the Union Flag over government buildings. Mr Trimble hoped the Rubicon had been crossed. If the IRA fulfilled its commitment and allowed weapons inspectors to look at some of its arms dumps, it would alleviate Ulster Unionist worries. The party's ruling council on Saturday backed a return to devolution by 53 to 47%. Mr Mallon hoped General John de Chastelain, chairman of the decommissioning body, would be able to issue a positive statement by the end of June.",

The discovery, made by a senior British Library scholar using a high-magnification binocular microscope, was said yesterday to show that the volume marked the birth of the first distinctively and proudly \"English\" culture. Another key finding of the research is that the dating of the gospels - one of the prime sourcebooks of English Christianity - should be moved forward from the long-accepted AD698 to about AD720. This means that the Venerable Bede, author of the first English history book, is now thought likely to have also been involved in producing the masterpiece. The drawings have been identified by Michelle Brown, curator of illuminated manuscripts at the British Library.

      "bodyText": "A request to rehabilitate the sinister figure of Lavrenty Beria, who as head of Josef Stalin's secret police was complicit in the deaths of millions of innocent Soviet citizens, was rejected yesterday by Russia's supreme court. Human rights activists expressed relief at the conclusion to the case, which has threatened to undermine the work of the military prosecutor's rehabilitation department to salvage the reputations of Stalin's victims. Beria's son has championed a campaign to pardon the former NKVD chief (the internal security organ which later became the KGB) on the grounds that most of the charges for which he was executed in 1953 were absurd concoctions. Shortly after Stalin's death, Beria was arrested and accused of anti-state terrorism and high treason - charges which included the unlikely allegation that he was a British spy. In the struggle for power that followed Stalin's death, Beria's rivals wanted to see him removed as quickly as possible and the ludicrous spying charge is thought to have been included to strengthen the case for his swift execution. A detailed list of preliminary charges claimed that he had attempted to undermine the country's cattle-breeding and vegetable production programmes. Many of the crimes for which he is remembered - including the deportation of ethnic groups from the Caucasus and the incarceration of thousands of anti-Soviet dissidents - were deemed too sensitive to mention on the charge sheet. Lawyers had argued that there might be a case for a review on strictly legal grounds - because although there was abundant evidence of Beria's general guilt there was little evidence that he was guilty of the key accusations against him. According to the law on rehabilitation in Russia, if someone has been wrongly executed on false charges, they have the right to have their name cleared posthumously. However, the supreme court, made up of military judges, ruled yesterday that this could not apply to Beria or the several police officials shot alongside him. The court concluded that the rules governing the rehabilitation of victims of repression should not be applied to senior officials who were themselves responsible for the repression. Arseny Roginsky, president of the human rights group Memorial, which works to clear the names of victims of Soviet-era repressions, said any other outcome would have been unacceptable. \"Beria was convicted of crimes that he was not guilty of, but he was nevertheless a guilty man.\"",

      "bodyText": "Israel's supreme court yesterday ignored dark mutterings about a modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah, granting a lesbian couple equal rights as mothers to their son. The ruling, which confirms Nicole Brener Kadish as the adoptive mother of her partner's biological son, Mattan, is the first of its kind in Israel. It also sets an international precedent by recognising an adoption by a lesbian couple that was formalised elsewhere. \"This means that the court has recognised that a child can have two mothers,\" said Hadas Tagari of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel. \"The fact that both women are recognised as mothers to the same child means that there is indirectly recognition of the lesbian family.\" For Nicole Brener Kadish and her partner Ruthy Brener Kadish, who had Mattan in California, before returning to Israel, the victory was the end of a year-long legal campaign. Although Nicole had legally adopted the child in California, Israel's interior ministry refused to honour that ruling on the grounds that both parents were of the same sex. Yesterday, the interior minister, Natan Sharansky, said he would order officials to honour the court's decision. \"It's great for us on so many levels - symbolically, and practically on day-to-day decisions. I can take him to the doctor. I can take him out of the country. It is a huge relief,\" said Nicole Brener Kadish. \"Before this, I was a complete legal stranger to him. When we came back from the US, the state turned Ruthy into a de facto single parent.\" The couple's supporters hailed the verdict as a victory for pluralism, and for non-traditional families. However, within minutes of the verdict two MPs from a religious party were agitating for new family legislation, which they claimed would save Israel from the fate of the biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, destroyed by God for their wickedness. \"The supreme court is more powerful than God because to this day God has yet to create a single child from two mothers and now the supreme court has succeeded,\" said Michael Eitan of the rightwing opposition Likud party. The verdict does not immediately apply to the couple's younger son, Naveh, who was born in Israel, or to hundreds of other same sex parents seeking equal adoption rights to heterosexual couples.",

In February I met Robert Fisk for the first time at the Savoy Hotel, where he was receiving his umpteenth award for outstanding coverage of international affairs.

Mr Mann is accused of devoting much of the past few months to a virtually full-time campaign for the seat and - by some critics - of overstepping the boundaries of party rule 4B13(e) which forbids candidates or their supporters from \"interference in the process of applications for, or the issue and return of, postal votes\". Labour officials at Millbank and East Midlands regional HQ have vetted these complaints and found them groundless. \"It's an election, so you go out and get people to vote for you,\" Mr Mann said. \"The reason people voted for me was that I was the first Labour party person they have ever seen.\" In short, Mr Mann stands accused of winning. But whether he is an ambitious apparatchik who cunningly wooed most of Bassetlaw's 160 postal voters - a high number by normal standards - or an experienced union backed candidate facing \"chattering class\" opposition, there are lessons to be drawn. Ambitious candidates, locals or outsiders, willing to get stuck in at grassroots with the membership list can get an unbeatable head start.",

A trade union is said to have offered to spend the six-figure sum refurbishing the local Labour offices if its favoured son is picked. The story is doing the rounds as candidates - male as well as female - privately complain the party's rule book is not being enforced. Ward parties are required to nominate at least one woman with rule 4B.10(c) stating: \"Where party branches nominate they shall be obliged to submit the names of one man and one woman.\" Yet the women hoping to be selected as Labour's prospective parliamentary candidate, of whom there are at least three, claim they have not been invited to meetings. The chauvinism, in a seat famous for its Ford plant, is believed to stem from the decision more than a year ago of the sitting Labour MP, Judith Church, to step down. Ms Church, who won Dagenham in a 1994 byelection after the death of leftwinger Joan Richardson, had been tipped for great things but is quitting after citing \"personal reasons\". No Labour runner would speak out publicly yesterday and no formal complaints have been registered amid fears that such comments would scupper their chances. But a Dagenham contender said: \"Some, but not all, of the male members just remember that she was a woman and don't want another one. It's complete rubbish. \"We were not told about the meetings and, when a ward was warned it had to nominate a woman, one of the men said 'at least we don't have to listen to her as well'.\" A 17,054 majority makes Dagenham a Labour stronghold yet the Commons seat is in the hands of only a couple of hundred people. Membership has slumped from 500 to just 350 since the election and many local meetings are inquorate. Labour hopefuls include Downing Street official Jon Cruddas, Bexley councillor Teresa Pearce, train driver Ray Parkin, Ms Richardson's former researcher Cameron Geddes, lawyer Emily Thornbury, and activist Sally Mulreddy. Postal votes hold the key to selection, which gives a clear advantage to individuals or unions with the time and resources to organise. The hustings on June 30 coincide with the close of the ballot when all postal votes must be in.",

Gene Tunney. Rocky Marciano. With names like comic-book superheroes, these giants of the 20s and 30s were untouchable. Symbolic supermen. You wouldn't catch any of these dropping their belts into the dustbin like Riddick Bowe. And perhaps the greatest heavyweight of this golden age was Joe Louis, the Brown Bomber.</p> <p>Still the longest reigning champion of all time, there's little doubting Louis's awesome ability as a fighter. He was brave and he was brutal. Ernest Hemingway called his four-round destruction of Max Baer in 1935 the \"most disgusting spectacle outside of a public hanging\" he had ever witnessed. But, perhaps unjustly, Louis's reputation, as examined in tonight's The Boxer Who Beat Hitler (9pm, BBC 2), rests less on the 12 years he ruled the division, and more on one night in 1938 when the hopes of a nation were placed on his shoulders.</p> <p>On the eve of war, Louis fought the German Max Schmeling for the Heavyweight Championship of the World. It was billed as \"democracy versus fascism\", and Louis delivered a monumental propaganda coup. But a look into the fight's background suggests that far from being a simple case of good versus evil, it was in fact a masterpiece of manipulation as cynical and calculated as anything Teflon Don could muster today.</p> <p>Louis had already lost to Schmeling in a supposed title eliminator two years previously. In truth Schmeling was well past his prime, but he'd outthought Louis and, against all the odds, had knocked him out. Despite the result, a half-million-dollar deal saw reigning champ Jim Braddock sidestep the German and take on the Brown Bomber instead. As planned, Louis, the superior fighter and a virtual certainty to beat Schmeling in a rematch, emerged victorious.</p> <p>Schmeling was promoted, on both sides of the Atlantic, as the pride of Nazi Germany, an Aryan warrior. Disingenuous to say the least. Schmeling was no Nazi. He had a Jewish manager (later he'd help numerous Jewish children flee Germany) and he was coming to the end of his career (after his defeat he'd win just four more fights). It was the desire to avenge the only loss on his record far more than any ideas of nationalist pride that spurred Louis to demolish Schmeling in a shade over two minutes. If anybody cried mismatch, it was lost in the patriotic roar.</p> <p>The morale-boosting victory turned Louis into a national hero. In a segregated society, he united black and white and helped break apartheid in America. And when the war came, Louis became an integral part of the US Army's propaganda machine, a symbol of American resistance to fascist oppression.</p> <p>But with Hitler safely dispatched, Louis was just another fighter, and by the late 40s his war effort was rewarded with a massive tax demand, ironically not for money he had personally received but for money generated for others in exhibition bouts. Like so many before and since, the champion was broke and forced out of retirement to face possible injury and inevitable humiliation.</p> <p>Towards the end of his life Louis succumbed to paranoid delusions exacerbated by drug and alcohol abuse. He was convinced the mafia were trying to kill him with poisoned gas, and took to pasting over the air vents in his room and smearing mayonnaise over the cracks in the ceiling. Perhaps his descent could have been predicted - his father had been committed when Louis was two years old.</p> <p>In boxing there's a fine line between guidance and exploitation. For every Bruno kept in cotton wool to be unwrapped on the big payday, there's a Tyson, spiralling unchecked and out of control. And whether the paymaster is a giant cable network or the allied war machine, the only certainty seems that no matter how great the fighter, nine times out of ten his career is a tragedy in waiting: with the final act played out to empty stalls.</p>",

You wouldn't catch any of these dropping their belts into the dustbin like Riddick Bowe. And perhaps the greatest heavyweight of this golden age was Joe Louis, the Brown Bomber. Still the longest reigning champion of all time, there's little doubting Louis's awesome ability as a fighter. He was brave and he was brutal. Ernest Hemingway called his four-round destruction of Max Baer in 1935 the \"most disgusting spectacle outside of a public hanging\" he had ever witnessed. But, perhaps unjustly, Louis's reputation, as examined in tonight's The Boxer Who Beat Hitler (9pm, BBC 2), rests less on the 12 years he ruled the division, and more on one night in 1938 when the hopes of a nation were placed on his shoulders. On the eve of war, Louis fought the German Max Schmeling for the Heavyweight Championship of the World. It was billed as \"democracy versus fascism\", and Louis delivered a monumental propaganda coup. But a look into the fight's background suggests that far from being a simple case of good versus evil, it was in fact a masterpiece of manipulation as cynical and calculated as anything Teflon Don could muster today. Louis had already lost to Schmeling in a supposed title eliminator two years previously. In truth Schmeling was well past his prime, but he'd outthought Louis and, against all the odds, had knocked him out. Despite the result, a half-million-dollar deal saw reigning champ Jim Braddock sidestep the German and take on the Brown Bomber instead. As planned, Louis, the superior fighter and a virtual certainty to beat Schmeling in a rematch, emerged victorious. Schmeling was promoted, on both sides of the Atlantic, as the pride of Nazi Germany, an Aryan warrior. Disingenuous to say the least. Schmeling was no Nazi. He had a Jewish manager (later he'd help numerous Jewish children flee Germany) and he was coming to the end of his career (after his defeat he'd win just four more fights). It was the desire to avenge the only loss on his record far more than any ideas of nationalist pride that spurred Louis to demolish Schmeling in a shade over two minutes. If anybody cried mismatch, it was lost in the patriotic roar. The morale-boosting victory turned Louis into a national hero. In a segregated society, he united black and white and helped break apartheid in America. And when the war came, Louis became an integral part of the US Army's propaganda machine, a symbol of American resistance to fascist oppression. But with Hitler safely dispatched, Louis was just another fighter, and by the late 40s his war effort was rewarded with a massive tax demand, ironically not for money he had personally received but for money generated for others in exhibition bouts. Like so many before and since, the champion was broke and forced out of retirement to face possible injury and inevitable humiliation. Towards the end of his life Louis succumbed to paranoid delusions exacerbated by drug and alcohol abuse. He was convinced the mafia were trying to kill him with poisoned gas, and took to pasting over the air vents in his room and smearing mayonnaise over the cracks in the ceiling. Perhaps his descent could have been predicted - his father had been committed when Louis was two years old. In boxing there's a fine line between guidance and exploitation. For every Bruno kept in cotton wool to be unwrapped on the big payday, there's a Tyson, spiralling unchecked and out of control. And whether the paymaster is a giant cable network or the allied war machine, the only certainty seems that no matter how great the fighter, nine times out of ten his career is a tragedy in waiting: with the final act played out to empty stalls.",

So some of the site's most distinct features have a rather four-legged feel to them. Slowly graduating, wide staircases, once the horses' steps to their stables, have now been opened up for public use, and, on the upper floor, a series of the old stables have been converted into small, multi-function rooms. Some will be used as workshop and rehearsal spaces, others as teaching room. One is kitted out as a small dance studio, another as a larger project room for visiting artists. Light floods into this suite of rooms from the roof and from windows that open out on to a balcony overlooking the garden. Suddenly Tramway is about contrast as well as scale, relationships between spaces as much as the atmosphere of one space. </p> <p>The idea is to encourage a flow of people through the venue: not just the crowds hungry for shows, but others with a link to Tramway through its residencies, workshops and small-scale events. It's not these that will catch your eye, though, in the reopening programme, which is as diverse and diverting as any in the past. Highlights include the renowned New York performance troupe the Wooster Group, in its first UK performances for eight years, and a major group show, Another Place, featuring work by important local, British and international artists.

He arrived in 1952, aged 18, to study at the London Academy of Dramatic Art before going on to do a seven-year apprenticeship on almost every stage in the country.

But Sutherland insists this is not the nature of the movie medium, and although he speaks softly, his words carry a big reputation. In the past 40 years he has made more than 100 films - 10 in the past two years alone. Most stars would give their Learjets to have worked with the directors he has, a collection that includes Federico Fellini, Bernardo Bertolucci, Louis Malle, Robert Aldrich, Robert Altman and Nicolas Roeg. In the process he has developed into an extremely versatile actor: as insidious as Anthony Hopkins, as winning as James Stewart, as chameleon-like as Alec Guinness, and capable of playing anything from comedy to grand guignol. </p> <p>Louis Malle marvelled at Suther land's \"melange of looseness and tension\". That loose-limbed style was probably best expressed as Hawkeye, the oddball iconoclast in M*A*S*H, while his best buttoned-up performance was as the tough-yet-tender detective in Alan J Pakula's Klute. But Sutherland's special genius lies in his ability to plumb the depths of our behaviour and make us care, whether he is playing a foppish Casanova or the duped, starstruck Homer Simpson of The Day of the Locust. Although Sutherland's perceptive portrayals have won him both critical and popular acclaim, he has no illusions about the actor's role. \"Actors,\" he says bluntly, \"have no control in films.\" </p> <p>But he didn't feel that way in 1970 when M*A*S*H catapulted him to stardom. Back then, fresh from his experience on the British stage, he naively believed actors were autonomous on a film set - \"and that the director had to satisfy me . \"I did that with Bob Altman on M*A*S*H,\" he admitted. \"I had no idea how good he was. I saw the movie from my character's perspective, which was not broad enough.\" </p> <p>Sutherland believes now that he was mistaken about every role he took on before 1973. But that year he went to work for Roeg on the eerie horror film, Don't Look Now. \"With Nic, I said, 'I think the ending of the film is incorrect. It should be more optimistic, it should include spiritualism as a learning process.' 'That might be fine for you,' he said, 'but it's no good for me.' No one had ever said that to me before. Nic taught me to put my trust in a director. It wasn't easy for me because I don't trust easily. But Nic was so strong I had to make that decision.\" </p> <p>Since then Sutherland has measured his success in terms of the directors he has performed for. He was so anxious to play Casanova for Fellini that he dropped his fee to \u00a360,000 for almost a year's work. He had to \"stand in line\" for his part in Bertolucci's 1900 and he personally contacted Schlesinger to ask for the role of Homer Simpson in The Day of the Locust. But there is a downside to this flexible approach to directors: Sutherland has not built up a consistent image, and in Hollywood, where his name has been conspicuously absent at Oscar nominations, that can be seen as a lack of commercial consistency. </p> <p>\"I think it has hurt Donald not to be labelled,\" says the veteran producer Edward Lewis. \"He may be known as a 'director's actor,' but at the box office he's not seen as a star with an identifiable following like Eastwood or Gibson. Because no two of his roles are alike, the audience doesn't know what to expect when he is cast, and Hollywood may feel it can't count on him.\" </p> <p>Also film critics have charged that, in among the 100-plus roles, Sutherland has wasted his talents on throwaway parts. But, he insists, \"I don't act characters I don't love, I don't do films that I don't morally believe in. I turned down Deliverance and Straw Dogs because I disagreed with the violence, although now I think I was wrong. I go to work to sustain my creative self. If you stop acting, you get old. It's like being in a marriage. When you stop fucking, the marriage dies.\" </p> <p>That still doesn't explain some of the tat Sutherland has been in, like Revolution, or the Sylvester Stallone vehicle Lock Up or, maybe worst of all, the movie version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. \"Why not take a role like that?\" says Sutherland about Buffy. \"I liked the idea of that film. The only thing I had asked the director [Fran Rubel Kuzui] was that it seemed incorrect that my character would die, and she said to me, 'That's because you want to be in the sequel'. At that point, I realised I was in the wrong film.\" </p> <p>By way of mitigation he adds, \"Al Pacino and I sat on top of a hill once when we were doing Revolution and he said, 'I've never said this before in my life, but this one, really, I believe will be great.'

The woman is wearing a dressing gown, man-made fabric masquerading as silk, which she pulls over her underwear.</p> <p>The toilet door shuts and she loiters on the landing between two sex flats in Soho, central London. Suspicion, fear, panic make her shout: \"What you want?\" \"Why\" and \"Busy now\" in a heavily-accented voice, before slotting a key in the door with a notice advertising \"The best sex in Soho\". She disappears, her confusion echoed in the mutters to be heard inside the door.</p> <p>The woman, young and quite beautiful, is just one of a growing number of eastern European women and other illegal immigrants working in the dark world that is the sex industry in London's West End. She is just one part of a worrying facet that has changed the sexual landscape of the flats, massage parlours and call services that offer sex in the capital. Today, many women are advertised as \"young and fresh\", \"brand new\", and \"new in town\" - all code words implying that the prostitute is foreign.</p> <p><b> Kidnapped</b><br></p> <p>According to a soon-to-be-published Home Office report, more than 70% per cent of all sex workers in Soho are foreign. Others will put it at between 75% and 80% in some areas. Some of the women are working willingly, but increasing evidence shows that many have been kidnapped and forced into the work; that they are, in fact, sex slaves. In London, according to one source, it has become a \"multi multi million pound business\".</p> <p>The numbers are now so great that Home Office research and police intelligence reports show that the women and the traffickers and pimps are moving into suburbs all across Britain. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 sex workers from eastern Europe have crossed the borders but in the past five years they have moved across the Channel, to become commodities in the London sex trade. Now, as the UK seems less of a challenge, the sex workers are moving around.</p> <p>For the majority of those five years police believe that most of the women knew they were coming to work in the sex industry but were duped about what they could earn and the type of sex they would have to perform. Now, though, intelligence reports suggests that a number of women are being smuggled into this country against their will.</p> <p>Walk up the grubby stairwells of this Soho flat posted with cardboard signs advertising \"models\" and you can get an idea of just how many foreign women are working within this shady, often invisible trade. The sex workers themselves are not keen to talk, partly because they cannot speak English and partly because they are too scared. Often, there are pimps or traffickers who can be told quickly who is talking and what they are saying. Ask a woman where she is from and the reply is often \"Eeengleesh\" or, with the door closing, a smile and a simple \"No honey, bye honey.\"</p> <p>Some of the women work in the flats on their own, others have British maids who answer the door, greet the client, ask what kind of service he requires and communicates this to the prostitute in a kind of half verbal, half hand signal charade. The maids protect the ethnic origins of the girls within. They say the girls from eastern Europe are either Italian or Greek, no matter where they come from.</p> <p>Eddie (not his real name) is a doorman who vets the punters for various Soho establishments. He has worked in the sex industry for 32 years, a scene, he says, which has changed over the last few years. \"I wouldn't say every flat in Soho has a foreign girl in it, but in every other flat you will find a girl who comes from Kosovo, Albania, Romania. Before there used to be a lot of English and French girls but now the foreign girls are taking over. They don't hang around in the streets. They are always in the flats,\" he explains.</p> <p>\"Most of them are illegal immigrants. They make their way to England for a better life. Most of them don't speak English whatsoever, they can only say hello. I think the majority know what they are coming to. I think they come willingly to England. Maybe there's one or two cases where they force them to come.\"</p> <p><b> Mafia links</b><br></p> <p>Last year evidence emerged in court that women were indeed being forced into vice when three Lithuanian men were jailed for controlling four prostitutes they had trafficked. The men denied living off immoral earnings but were jailed for three years and recommended for deportation. In the four week trial, the jury heard how the break up of the Soviet Union led to mafia chiefs setting up organised vice rings in Britain. The jury was told that the women were handed fake documents and sent to London on false promises before being forced into brothels. One young mother from the Baltic told the jury she was \"bought\" by the gang for \u00a32,400 and forced into prostitution. She said: \"I had to work as a prostitute. I didn't want to do this but there was no choice. I was afraid, I was in a strange country and knew no one. There was always guards on the door of the brothel.\"</p> <p>Such vice can be a difficult thing to police, especially since the women are more often than not the victims of crime. In the office that houses the 14-strong Metropolitan police vice squad in Charing Cross station near the square mile of Soho and its 75 brothels, Inspector Paul Holmes explains how difficult the situation has become.</p> <p>He says that women working in effective imprisonment are too frightened to talk even if they could escape. Often, they have been told that the police here are in the pay of the criminal gangs or that if they report the crime they will be deported. The gangs always gather just enough information about the victim's family back home so that it can be used as a very serious threat of reprisal. In reality, the police are investigating a crime in which the victim cannot afford to talk.</p> <p>\"Up until recently we had not come across smuggled women. The majority of the women had travelled overtly on completely false documents or their own documents. But of late we are getting an increasing incidence of Balkan women being smuggled here,\" said Inspector Holmes. \"The women are not deceived about what they will do but about the conditions they will have to do it in. What the women contract into is effectively debt bondage. She will agree to pay so much money to the traffickers in arrears for her travel documents, means of travel, accommodation here.\"</p> <p>Inspector Holmes and his officers have found that the main regions of origin are central and south America, east and west Africa, south-east Asia, anywhere in the former Soviet bloc and the Balkan region. \"Currently, Thai women are paying anywhere between \u00a315,000 to \u00a325,000. They are sold a package which is credible if it were true. Women are told 'we will get you in on a six month visa entitlement and you can pay that off in three months'. When she gets here reality kicks in. Immediately, her documents will be snatched. She will be taken to a safe house and from then it's all downhill. They say they must have forgot to mention it is \u00a3175 for the rent of the flat and \u00a375 for the maid. So it's just loan-sharking. These women must be available for work and they must provide all services, including unprotected sex.\"</p> <p><b> Ruthless</b><br></p> <p>Last year the vice squad came across 284 foreign women working within Soho brothels. Inspector Holmes believes that in the sauna market the number of illegal women \"could be as much as 80 to 90 per cent\". He said: \"We are investigating resourceful, ruthless individuals working entirely on their own through to highly organised gangs doing it on a wholesale basis.</p> <p>\"It's such an extremely profitable business. It's a multi multi million pound business in this city but the trafficking phenomena is not a London only problem. If you go to any location ranging from a market town to a big city that's got an off-street sex business, you are likely to find foreign women working there.\"</p> <p>Inspector Holmes believes that the challenge for international law enforcement is to create the conditions in which the victims feel safe enough to testify. But he knows that each day the illegal trafficking of women gets bigger and bigger. And, like our European counterparts, Britain could see the beginnings of an extremely violent turf war for control of the business. He says: \"We have not yet reached saturation point but we will. There is nothing to indicate that we are not going to get the violence that has gone with the spread of the trade across Europe.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The face is weary, the eyes flickering in both fear and curiosity. The woman is wearing a dressing gown, man-made fabric masquerading as silk, which she pulls over her underwear. The toilet door shuts and she loiters on the landing between two sex flats in Soho, central London. Suspicion, fear, panic make her shout: \"What you want?\" \"Why\" and \"Busy now\" in a heavily-accented voice, before slotting a key in the door with a notice advertising \"The best sex in Soho\". She disappears, her confusion echoed in the mutters to be heard inside the door. The woman, young and quite beautiful, is just one of a growing number of eastern European women and other illegal immigrants working in the dark world that is the sex industry in London's West End. She is just one part of a worrying facet that has changed the sexual landscape of the flats, massage parlours and call services that offer sex in the capital. Today, many women are advertised as \"young and fresh\", \"brand new\", and \"new in town\" - all code words implying that the prostitute is foreign. Kidnapped According to a soon-to-be-published Home Office report, more than 70% per cent of all sex workers in Soho are foreign. Others will put it at between 75% and 80% in some areas. Some of the women are working willingly, but increasing evidence shows that many have been kidnapped and forced into the work; that they are, in fact, sex slaves. In London, according to one source, it has become a \"multi multi million pound business\". The numbers are now so great that Home Office research and police intelligence reports show that the women and the traffickers and pimps are moving into suburbs all across Britain. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 sex workers from eastern Europe have crossed the borders but in the past five years they have moved across the Channel, to become commodities in the London sex trade. Now, as the UK seems less of a challenge, the sex workers are moving around. For the majority of those five years police believe that most of the women knew they were coming to work in the sex industry but were duped about what they could earn and the type of sex they would have to perform.

      "body": "<p>A friend of mine went to a fashionable restaurant for her 50th birthday. Her evening was not a success. What happened? Nothing! \"As I walked into the restaurant no one looked up,\" she said. \"Not one single man gave me a glance. I wouldn't have minded if they had raised their eyes and then looked away when they realised that it was a middle-aged woman. But how did they know, without even taking a first look, that I wasn't worth a second one?\"</p> <p>In Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, there is a horrifying picture of the disillusion of the older woman as she watches the disintegration of all that gave her her power - her looks, her fertility, her sexual attraction. The surprise, according to de Beauvoir, is that this is not pre-eminent in the narcissistic beauty, the femme fatale, but in the ordinary woman who has unstintingly devoted herself to her family.</p> <p>The femme fatale will have such intimate acquaintance with her mirror that she will have noted every line and slippage well in advance and will have made some adaptation. It is the virtuous and innocent woman to whom getting older comes as a blow. Suddenly, no one seems to notice her any more. No one seems to need her.

Nothing! \"As I walked into the restaurant no one looked up,\" she said. \"Not one single man gave me a glance. I wouldn't have minded if they had raised their eyes and then looked away when they realised that it was a middle-aged woman. But how did they know, without even taking a first look, that I wasn't worth a second one?\" In Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, there is a horrifying picture of the disillusion of the older woman as she watches the disintegration of all that gave her her power - her looks, her fertility, her sexual attraction. The surprise, according to de Beauvoir, is that this is not pre-eminent in the narcissistic beauty, the femme fatale, but in the ordinary woman who has unstintingly devoted herself to her family. The femme fatale will have such intimate acquaintance with her mirror that she will have noted every line and slippage well in advance and will have made some adaptation. It is the virtuous and innocent woman to whom getting older comes as a blow. Suddenly, no one seems to notice her any more. No one seems to need her. The shock, says de Beauvoir, is almost as fatal as death itself. The power to magnetise comes and goes, like a power supply in a storm, and then suddenly The Female Formerly Known as Babe thinks, \"Hell, we're heading for a blackout.\" And it isn't, as women fear, due to an abrupt change from siren to hag.

Baker delivered the Sunday sermon at the church she regularly attends wearing a white smock smeared with tomato ketchup to illustrate the sin of anger. She told us that what she does about stains is wash them out in her wonderful washing machine. After a quick change she paraded up and down the aisle to the strains of Abba, showing off her smock, which was now a dazzling white. So the church is like a washing machine? Or it isn't? Should Dawn French tire of playing The Vicar of Dibley, Baker would make a perfect replacement. </p> <p>Once the hail might have been taken as a critical judgment, in the days when a church was imagined as a place that was literally sacred, the house of God. The duty of the artist was to make that sacredness visible in the paintings and carvings that decorated God's house. What we now call site-specific art began with a painting like Titian's altarpiece of the Assumption (1516-18) in the church of the Frari in Venice, a seven-metre tall canvas whose action leads up, up and away from gloomy earth into a realm of light as the Virgin floats towards the blazing gold of paradise. If this painting were to be placed in a museum we would miss one the most astonishing coups de theatre in art as Titian's painted light fuses with the real gold evening sky in the huge windows above. </p> <p>There are good reasons why we do not, and would not want to, live in a world where art and religion are so gorgeously one. But do modern churches have to be quite so aesthetically impoverished? Most of the spaces where this exhibition took place felt as sacred as waiting rooms. The church where Bobby Baker delivered her sermon was your bog- standard neogothic C of E church with an uneasy mixture of pointy arches and bright, friendly d\u00e9cor. Baker's ser mon displayed the same pinched timidity behind its bluster. Come on, give us some fire and brimstone. </p> <p>Art in Sacred Spaces is organised by \"a board of religious leaders and arts professionals with a consultant arts project manager\" and feels like it. There is Millennium Fund money, a mix of famous artists willing to show something they knocked up earlier and less famous ones glad of the commission, an enthusiastic art public willing to give up their Sundays traipsing to obscure churches, chapels and synagogues in search of that special site-specific frisson. But there seems to be no courage about asking hard questions of art or religion. What does it mean that our very idea of art was born in a religious context? </p> <p>Art in Sacred Spaces is less about rethinking the relationship between art and religion than letting the glamorous limelight of art pour through dusty 19th-century stained glass windows. Suffer the little children to come unto me, said Tracey Emin, and the result is a patchworked blanket on which pupils from Ecclestone Primary School name things they find beautiful. \"The children's interest was quickly aroused when they were told that a famous artist called Tracey Emin would be working with them,\" salivates a leaflet in St Mary's Church. The blanket is laid out in front of the altar. Things the children find beautiful include rabbits, cats, the sea, Spain, their mums. Aw, innit lovely. </p> <p>This artwork at least has a certain bravery. Emin is not afraid of being thought sentimental or tacky; in coming on like a charity-shop Matisse, worshipping beauty with cut-up rags just like he did in the chapel he decorated near Cannes, she acknowledges the celebratory, incantatory function of art. You leave thanking the Lord that she has found a subject other than herself. </p> <p>The critic Walter Benjamin argued that the symbiosis of art, architecture and history in a venerable religious space creates an \"aura\" that art has lost in the modern world as it separated itself from such places. The photographer Catherine Yass has made a career of misunderstanding Benjamin. She takes pictures of places saturated in history and atmosphere, then adds a blue ectoplasmic aura to the image. Here she shows photographs in a synagogue, the Congregation of Jacob in Whitechapel. This 1921 building, which feels as if it has been here since 1721, with its delicate blue walls and skylight, is the one building on the trail which feels sacred. Yass has taken pictures of this and other East End synagogues that hijack their atmosphere and turn them into images of decay. </p> <p>Art in Sacred Spaces avoids the hard and rocky road for the primrose path. The religious bodies involved seem embarrassingly eager to suck up to the gods of Britart. Some artists have simply allowed the use of existing works, displayed like relics. Rachel Whiteread shows some old screenprints in a Hackney synagogue. Mark Wallinger's well-known video Angel, in which the artist plays a blind man reciting the opening of St John's gospel at the bottom of the escalator of Angel tube station, Islington, is screened with what seems pointless literalness at St John the Evangelist Roman Catholic church round the corner from the Angel tube station. </p> <p>Only one artist has the brazen gall to state what is really happening here. Damien Hirst worships himself at St Stephen's, whose vicar says he feels \"bold\" for showing Hirst's The Last Supper. Hirst's Last Supper consists of prints in the manner of pharmaceuti cal labels advertising sausage and mash and steak pie hygienically sealed and sold by the company Damien &amp; Hirst. You think of the transubstantiation of matter into commodity. You think of the other Last Supper, Leonardo's, kept behind several plated glass doors and vacuum-sealed corridors, a monument to the moment when artists became bigger than Jesus. </p> <p>Art in Sacred Spaces is in locations around north and east London, till June 11.

Some artists have simply allowed the use of existing works, displayed like relics. Rachel Whiteread shows some old screenprints in a Hackney synagogue. Mark Wallinger's well-known video Angel, in which the artist plays a blind man reciting the opening of St John's gospel at the bottom of the escalator of Angel tube station, Islington, is screened with what seems pointless literalness at St John the Evangelist Roman Catholic church round the corner from the Angel tube station. Only one artist has the brazen gall to state what is really happening here. Damien Hirst worships himself at St Stephen's, whose vicar says he feels \"bold\" for showing Hirst's The Last Supper. Hirst's Last Supper consists of prints in the manner of pharmaceuti cal labels advertising sausage and mash and steak pie hygienically sealed and sold by the company Damien &amp; Hirst. You think of the transubstantiation of matter into commodity. You think of the other Last Supper, Leonardo's, kept behind several plated glass doors and vacuum-sealed corridors, a monument to the moment when artists became bigger than Jesus. Art in Sacred Spaces is in locations around north and east London, till June 11. Details: 020-7690 4809.",

One in 10 Britons shop online with well-heeled urban commuter types being, as ever, the most sought-after customer while older people living in out of the way places are more likely to be unfamiliar with buying on the net. The research, compiled by market analysts CACI using 30m lifestyle records, shows that Reading is the online consumer capital with nearly 18% of adults regularly surfing the web for holidays, books, CDs and other goods and services. London and Cambridge follow close behind. In these and other online boom towns such as Chester, Southampton and Brighton, internet shopping poses a real threat to those businesses with little or no web presence. But wide swaths have been left almost untouched. In the north of England, Scotland and Wales only 16% of adults are online and less than 6% are frequent online buyers while rural and remote counties such as Cornwall or Orkney show the greatest reluctance to take up shopping on the web. Lower computer literacy was partly to blame for the slow uptake of internet shopping in rural areas, the authors suggest. \"A lot of people have access to the internet at work, and those kinds of white-collar jobs tend to be more concentrated in urban areas,\" said Paul Winters, head of market analysis at CACI. The study notes the irony that the lowest profile in e-commerce is in rural communities, \"one of the catchment types with potentially most to gain from the internet\" because of the decline in transport and shops. Mr Winters said: \"For someone in a rural community to be able to go online and order everything from groceries to clothing and CDs and have them delivered to their door would seem more advantageous than for someone like me who can get on the tube and be in the West End in minutes.\" The urban centres at the bottom end of the scale are predominantly in poorer northern areas, with Liverpool having only 16.6% of the population online and just 5% as frequent online purchasers. The report highlights not only a clear north-south divide, but also a sharp distinction between rich and poor despite the lower prices online. The north has concentrations of online shoppers in areas like Wilmslow, Manchester's wealthy commuter suburb, while Edinburgh is among the exceptions to the rule in Scotland. However, digital TV could change the scale of online buying in the next 10 years.

      "bodyText": "For John Keats, one-time medic turned Romantic poet, the works of William Shakespeare were, quite simply, \"enough\". It was a view shared by the majority of his contemporaries and successors but not, it would appear, by the dons of Cambridge University who are considering scrapping their exam paper on the bard to make way for more modern literature. The highly controversial move - which is set to draw accusations of \"dumbing down\" - would mean the playwright would no longer be given privileged status but would be studied alongside his contemporaries as part of a paper spanning works from 1550 to 1700. In addition, there would be a compulsory Shakespeare question in a separate paper on tragedies. But there would be no requirement to answer any more than the two questions on his entire canon, comprising 37 plays, two narrative poems and 148 sonnets. The proposal, which is unlikely to come into force for three years, is being considered because the university wants to make more room for Victorian and 20th century authors, currently crammed into a single paper covering literature from 1830 to the present day. \"Every year that paper becomes more of a monstrosity because it becomes longer, and something has to be done about it,\" said Anne Barton, a fellow of Trinity College. In addition, the faculty believes that few students read the entire canon and that many of them merely regurgitate their A-level texts in the exam room. \"If the Shakespeare paper is made a compulsory part of the renaissance paper, it's not the end of the world,\" said Professor Barton. \"In fact, I think there's a good deal to be said for putting him in the context of contemporary literature, both dramatic and non-dramatic.\" She added: \"There's no question of scrapping Shakespeare as a compulsory part of the degree and to accuse us of 'dumbing down' is ridiculous.\" But the recommendation, which follows Oxford University's recent move to make its Anglo Saxon course optional, has drawn strong criticism from academics outside the university. \"Of course I think it's absolutely necessary to study Shakespeare\", said Frank Kermode, the university's former King Edward VII professor of English, who added he would be \"very surprised\" if the proposal succeeded. \"The whole of our literature has to be estimated in relation to him. This seems to me a foolishness. It would certainly change the whole balance of the course and would be a net loss to put it mildly.\" John Carey, Merton professor of English literature at Oxford University, said: \"I'm personally in favour of a compulsory paper because Shakespeare seems to be the one writer who everyone who comes afterwards has read. \"All the writers after him have read, learned, allude to, react against him. So, unless you know your Shakespeare, you don't read post-Shakespeare literature properly. \"I do think you have to read the whole canon if you are reading Shakespeare - and if it's just an option on a renaissance paper, people won't do it.\" \"Keats in his letters said 'Shakespeare is enough for us' and I think that if you had to choose one author, he'd be the one. Is he enough? Well, he's a start.\" Useful link Cambridge English course requirementsl",

Arson attacks on empty properties may, thankfully, be a relic of an angrier past, but pressure is mounting for action from the country's new democratic institutions to curb purchases that have been blamed for depopulating communities and threatening the Welsh language.</p> <p>The Welsh national assembly is being urged to investigate whether planning regulations could be changed to allow local authorities to deal with the issue.</p> <p>In Newport, where around 30% of residential properties have become holiday cottages, there is strong support for a punitive rate of council tax for second home owners.</p> <p>The town - population 1,100, with two banks, shops, cafes and a post office - appears to be flourishing. But Tony Lewis, a town councillor who ran the town's bookshop until his retirement last year, claims that places like Newport are living on a knife edge.</p> <p>\"Any community can stand a certain percentage of second homes,\" he said. \"But once it becomes a majority the community begins to die because you can't support local shops just on the tourist trade.</p> <p>\"Already a lot of businesses are not finding it easy and if you get many more second homes it could tip the balance and finish them off. You can't blame people for wanting to come here - it's a fabulous, unspoilt area. But we have reached saturation point and I really feel that planning controls should allow a veto by local planning authorities on the number of second, holiday homes.\"</p> <p>Glyn Rees, a Pembrokeshire county councillor and Newport's mayor, shares the view that curbs need to be introduced .</p> <p>\"This is not anti-English. We want people to come down here, but we want them to live here and be part of the community,\" he said. \"Five years ago a new primary school was built for 120 pupils, but there are only about half that number there because local people can't afford to buy properties in Newport and move outside the catchment area.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the strongest support for controls on second home ownership comes from the Welsh language pressure group Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg, which regards the influx of non Welsh speakers as the principal cause of the decline in the language since the 1960s.</p> <p>Dylan Phillips, a spokesman for the society, said that while the number of Welsh speakers is on the increase in the industrial south-east and the north-east of the country the language continues to decline in traditional rural heartlands.</p> <p>\"A number of villages are being left empty for a long period of the year,\" he said. \"It is breaking up community life because young people can't afford to buy the houses and are having to migrate for economic reasons.</p> <p>\"Ideally I would like to see the number of second homes being restricted to only 5% of the housing stock within any community.\"</p> <p>Planning restrictions on second home ownership are among a host of suggestions that have been put to the Welsh assembly as part of the national housing strategy consultation process. They are likely to receive strong support.</p> <p>The government line in Cardiff is that there are no plans for subordinate legislation of this kind. But a spokesman for the first secretary, Rhodri Morgan, said it would be surprising if the national housing strategy currently being prepared did not address \"the problem of second homes\".</p> <p>Plaid Cymru believes that if a property is to be sold as a second home it should be treated as \"a change of use\", forcing the buyer to seek planning permission.</p> <p>Elin Jones, Plaid Cymru AM for Ceredigion, which is said to have the fastest rate of inward migration of any county in Wales, said the policy did not mean that second home purchase had to be denied. But it would allow local authorities to have a planning role.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat housing and local government spokesman, Peter Black AM, said there was a need to introduce measures to help people stay in their communities. He called for restrictions to be put on second homes by taking away council tax incentives and tightening up the planning process.</p> <p>\"This is not just a language issue,\" he said. \"It is an issue about the sustainability of rural communities in the face of depopulation and the break up of community life from the lack of affordable housing for local people.\"</p> <p>But the proposed measures met with opposition from Welsh Conservatives. The party's local government spokesman, David Davies AM, said they would discriminate against non-Welsh speakers and fuel anti-Welsh language sentiment.</p> <p>Damning the proposals as \"hare-brained\", he said policies to prevent second homes in Wales would harm the language in the long run.</p>",

In Newport, where around 30% of residential properties have become holiday cottages, there is strong support for a punitive rate of council tax for second home owners. The town - population 1,100, with two banks, shops, cafes and a post office - appears to be flourishing. But Tony Lewis, a town councillor who ran the town's bookshop until his retirement last year, claims that places like Newport are living on a knife edge. \"Any community can stand a certain percentage of second homes,\" he said. \"But once it becomes a majority the community begins to die because you can't support local shops just on the tourist trade. \"Already a lot of businesses are not finding it easy and if you get many more second homes it could tip the balance and finish them off. You can't blame people for wanting to come here - it's a fabulous, unspoilt area. But we have reached saturation point and I really feel that planning controls should allow a veto by local planning authorities on the number of second, holiday homes.\" Glyn Rees, a Pembrokeshire county councillor and Newport's mayor, shares the view that curbs need to be introduced . \"This is not anti-English. We want people to come down here, but we want them to live here and be part of the community,\" he said. \"Five years ago a new primary school was built for 120 pupils, but there are only about half that number there because local people can't afford to buy properties in Newport and move outside the catchment area.\" Perhaps the strongest support for controls on second home ownership comes from the Welsh language pressure group Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg, which regards the influx of non Welsh speakers as the principal cause of the decline in the language since the 1960s. Dylan Phillips, a spokesman for the society, said that while the number of Welsh speakers is on the increase in the industrial south-east and the north-east of the country the language continues to decline in traditional rural heartlands. \"A number of villages are being left empty for a long period of the year,\" he said. \"It is breaking up community life because young people can't afford to buy the houses and are having to migrate for economic reasons. \"Ideally I would like to see the number of second homes being restricted to only 5% of the housing stock within any community.\" Planning restrictions on second home ownership are among a host of suggestions that have been put to the Welsh assembly as part of the national housing strategy consultation process. They are likely to receive strong support. The government line in Cardiff is that there are no plans for subordinate legislation of this kind. But a spokesman for the first secretary, Rhodri Morgan, said it would be surprising if the national housing strategy currently being prepared did not address \"the problem of second homes\". Plaid Cymru believes that if a property is to be sold as a second home it should be treated as \"a change of use\", forcing the buyer to seek planning permission. Elin Jones, Plaid Cymru AM for Ceredigion, which is said to have the fastest rate of inward migration of any county in Wales, said the policy did not mean that second home purchase had to be denied. But it would allow local authorities to have a planning role. The Liberal Democrat housing and local government spokesman, Peter Black AM, said there was a need to introduce measures to help people stay in their communities. He called for restrictions to be put on second homes by taking away council tax incentives and tightening up the planning process. \"This is not just a language issue,\" he said. \"It is an issue about the sustainability of rural communities in the face of depopulation and the break up of community life from the lack of affordable housing for local people.\" But the proposed measures met with opposition from Welsh Conservatives. The party's local government spokesman, David Davies AM, said they would discriminate against non-Welsh speakers and fuel anti-Welsh language sentiment. Damning the proposals as \"hare-brained\", he said policies to prevent second homes in Wales would harm the language in the long run.",

He had died peacefully in his sleep, aged 60.</p> <p>Roberts was one of the finest camera operators in the world, and probably the greatest British film cameraman ever. Working for more than 40 years with directors like Neil Jordan, Richard Attenborough, Roland Joff\u00e9, Fred Zinnemann and Steven Spielberg, he elevated his art and craft to new levels, being an essential part of four films that won Academy awards for cinematography and four further nominations. In 1997, he was awarded the Michael Balcon Award by Bafta for his outstanding contribution to British cinema, the first technician to be so honoured.</p> <p>As a director, I made eight films with Mike as my camera operator, and the thought of filming without him, frankly, fills me with dread. Like many directors, I will miss him terribly. He was our eyes; his understanding and \"know- ingness\" of a scene were consummate. Although he had no formal arts training, his perception of composition and light was instinctive and intuitive, as was his mastery of how subtle and artful camera movement could add power and energy to a shot.</p> <p>Born in Woking, Surrey, Mike started out as a runner in Fleet Street, catching the bug for film at Southall studios while working for Pearl and Dean. He moved to ABPC Elstree studios as a central camera loader, and after six years went freelance, working his way up from clapper loader on films like School For Scoundrels to focus puller on A Man For All Seasons. One day when the camera operator had flu, he moved up to the seat on the dolly, which he occupied for 65 films.</p> <p>A wiry, slender man, his face craggy and leathery from the wind and sun of a thousand locations, he had a gracefulness and agility that made him the acknowledged master of his craft. As the camera swooped and dipped across a set, balanced on a small platform, Mike would twist and pivot, gently shifting his balance from one leg to the next, his face glued to the eyepiece.</p> <p>Liam Neeson once said: \"It's incredible to see him at work, bent over the camera, be it 60ft high or racing along a track. It's as if the camera is an extension of his body.\"</p> <p>Mike was also extremely brave. No matter if he was filming a Khmer Rouge explosion in The Killing Fields, hanging from a tank on Empire Of The Sun, braving the Iguaz\u00fa falls on a raft on The Mission, or facing the collapsing walls of a burning church in Mississippi Burning, he never moved away from the camera eyepiece for one second.</p> <p>Receiving his Balcon award, he generously thanked his long-time camera grip, Colin Manning, who, he said, \"has probably pushed me halfway round the world to get me here tonight.\" And all around the world was where Mike filmed, as he relentlessly and passionately worked on one film after another, often without a break, first choice as he was of directors worldwide.</p> <p>The producer, David Puttnam, remarked: \"If ever there was proof that film is a collaborative art form, then Mike is it.\" On every shot, he would interact with almost every member of the crew, and always with grace and calm professionalism.</p> <p>He also had an extraordinary rapport with actors - being, as he was very often, the closest person to them on a film set. His gentle manner and unselfish technique (he never needed to ask for repeat takes because of the camera's imperfections, such was his skill) put great actors at ease, allowing them the freedom to be of their best.</p> <p>Last week in the bars of Pinewood and Shepperton studios, the conversations were all about Mike, touching, as he had, the lives of three generations of film people. The sad news of his passing was attached to the call-sheets of the films in production. In many cases, filming literally stopped in Britain and abroad because crews were just too shocked and devastated to be able to work.</p> <p>That a camera technician should have had this effect - not a movie star, director or producer, but an unpretentious, self-effacing brilliant man, who was never once known to raise his voice - is testament to the respect everyone had for Mike.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife Eileen, his two daughters, Danielle and Georgina, and his mother and sister.</p> <p><b>On the set with a great operator</b></p> <p>Neil Jordan writes: <br> I first met Mike Roberts on the set of The Company Of Wolves. He was then in the middle of an extraordinary career as a camera operator, having worked with directors out of the mists of the past, like Henry Hathaway and Fred Zinnemann.</p> <p>But I didn't know that. What I did know was a lined, gypsy face, a pair of steady blue eyes and a thin, sinewy hand that guided his camera effortlessly to that magical place where the scene, the setting and the actor's face begin to make sense.</p> <p>The film I was making - with its unreal settings, its stories within stories, transformations and leaps of fancy - made very little sense to anyone else on the crew, but that didn't trouble Mike. What he saw was what he saw, and if a crane shot, for example, that travelled through a forest, beginning in summer and ending in winter, allowed him a smile at the absurdity of the conception, it was executed beautifully.</p> <p>In fact, as he executed shots and gave them as gifts to the director, he collected stories as a kind of payment. And between shots, he would tell these stories, of past set-ups, past movies, hilarious stories, always pivoting on the absurdity of the film-making process.</p> <p>Over the years, I came to work with many great cameramen, but somehow always with the same operator, and that was Mike. He would come off a Steven Spielberg film, an Alan Parker film, a Roland Joff\u00e9 film to whatever small obsession I had made for myself and step immediately into its world.</p> <p>He would tell his stories as the tracks were being laid, the shot lit, about whatever absurdities he'd encountered since I last met him, then suddenly click into action when the cameras rolled.</p> <p>He loved first takes, unrehearsed shots, impossible set-ups. With what Chris Menges called his \"Cartier- Bresson thing\", the moment was what he valued, the sense of unique happening, and, for Mike, whatever happened always happened through the actor.</p> <p>Technically, he was extraordinary. He did a shot on a hothead once, with a crane that moved through 180 degrees, and, during the second take, his video monitor blew. He executed it blind - and that take made it to the finished film.</p> <p>I thought he would abandon operating, as most operators do, and light his own films, but for some reason that never interested him. What did interest him was his seat on the dolly that Colin pushed, the actors in front of him - and maybe even the director behind him.</p> <p>While I was shooting the death of Michael Collins in the hills of Wicklow, with Liam Neeson in the foreground and a line of silhouetted extras in the hills beyond, one of the extras fell into a fissure in the mountain. We found out that he was uninjured, and, while waiting for a helicopter to arrive and winch him out, I set up another shot.</p> <p>Sarah, my daughter and my assistant on the film, berated me for my heartlessness. I tried to explain that keeping a crew down here waiting idle wouldn't help the rescue process up there. Mike said he fully expected to die on a dolly one day - and be hoisted off it and replaced as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Over the past few years, as Pinewood and Shepperton filled up with gizmo-driven movies, and as the camera became subsumed beneath a wealth of digital effects, his enthusiasm for some of the films he worked on waned a little. For him, nothing could replace an actor's face.</p> <p>But his repertoire of absurdities gained immeasurably. I always hoped that he would one day write them down - Mike Roberts: The Collected Absurdities Of A Life In Film. And now he has been tragically denied that opportunity. So maybe those of us who remember them should write them down for him. But I doubt if we could ever tell them as well.</p> <p>\u0095 Mike Roberts, film cameraman, born July 20 1939; died May 24 2000</p>",

Although he had no formal arts training, his perception of composition and light was instinctive and intuitive, as was his mastery of how subtle and artful camera movement could add power and energy to a shot. Born in Woking, Surrey, Mike started out as a runner in Fleet Street, catching the bug for film at Southall studios while working for Pearl and Dean. He moved to ABPC Elstree studios as a central camera loader, and after six years went freelance, working his way up from clapper loader on films like School For Scoundrels to focus puller on A Man For All Seasons. One day when the camera operator had flu, he moved up to the seat on the dolly, which he occupied for 65 films. A wiry, slender man, his face craggy and leathery from the wind and sun of a thousand locations, he had a gracefulness and agility that made him the acknowledged master of his craft. As the camera swooped and dipped across a set, balanced on a small platform, Mike would twist and pivot, gently shifting his balance from one leg to the next, his face glued to the eyepiece. Liam Neeson once said: \"It's incredible to see him at work, bent over the camera, be it 60ft high or racing along a track. It's as if the camera is an extension of his body.\" Mike was also extremely brave. No matter if he was filming a Khmer Rouge explosion in The Killing Fields, hanging from a tank on Empire Of The Sun, braving the Iguaz\u00fa falls on a raft on The Mission, or facing the collapsing walls of a burning church in Mississippi Burning, he never moved away from the camera eyepiece for one second. Receiving his Balcon award, he generously thanked his long-time camera grip, Colin Manning, who, he said, \"has probably pushed me halfway round the world to get me here tonight.\" And all around the world was where Mike filmed, as he relentlessly and passionately worked on one film after another, often without a break, first choice as he was of directors worldwide. The producer, David Puttnam, remarked: \"If ever there was proof that film is a collaborative art form, then Mike is it.\" On every shot, he would interact with almost every member of the crew, and always with grace and calm professionalism. He also had an extraordinary rapport with actors - being, as he was very often, the closest person to them on a film set. His gentle manner and unselfish technique (he never needed to ask for repeat takes because of the camera's imperfections, such was his skill) put great actors at ease, allowing them the freedom to be of their best. Last week in the bars of Pinewood and Shepperton studios, the conversations were all about Mike, touching, as he had, the lives of three generations of film people. The sad news of his passing was attached to the call-sheets of the films in production. In many cases, filming literally stopped in Britain and abroad because crews were just too shocked and devastated to be able to work. That a camera technician should have had this effect - not a movie star, director or producer, but an unpretentious, self-effacing brilliant man, who was never once known to raise his voice - is testament to the respect everyone had for Mike. He is survived by his wife Eileen, his two daughters, Danielle and Georgina, and his mother and sister. On the set with a great operator Neil Jordan writes: I first met Mike Roberts on the set of The Company Of Wolves. He was then in the middle of an extraordinary career as a camera operator, having worked with directors out of the mists of the past, like Henry Hathaway and Fred Zinnemann. But I didn't know that. What I did know was a lined, gypsy face, a pair of steady blue eyes and a thin, sinewy hand that guided his camera effortlessly to that magical place where the scene, the setting and the actor's face begin to make sense. The film I was making - with its unreal settings, its stories within stories, transformations and leaps of fancy - made very little sense to anyone else on the crew, but that didn't trouble Mike. What he saw was what he saw, and if a crane shot, for example, that travelled through a forest, beginning in summer and ending in winter, allowed him a smile at the absurdity of the conception, it was executed beautifully. In fact, as he executed shots and gave them as gifts to the director, he collected stories as a kind of payment. And between shots, he would tell these stories, of past set-ups, past movies, hilarious stories, always pivoting on the absurdity of the film-making process. Over the years, I came to work with many great cameramen, but somehow always with the same operator, and that was Mike. He would come off a Steven Spielberg film, an Alan Parker film, a Roland Joff\u00e9 film to whatever small obsession I had made for myself and step immediately into its world. He would tell his stories as the tracks were being laid, the shot lit, about whatever absurdities he'd encountered since I last met him, then suddenly click into action when the cameras rolled. He loved first takes, unrehearsed shots, impossible set-ups. With what Chris Menges called his \"Cartier- Bresson thing\", the moment was what he valued, the sense of unique happening, and, for Mike, whatever happened always happened through the actor. Technically, he was extraordinary. He did a shot on a hothead once, with a crane that moved through 180 degrees, and, during the second take, his video monitor blew. He executed it blind - and that take made it to the finished film. I thought he would abandon operating, as most operators do, and light his own films, but for some reason that never interested him. What did interest him was his seat on the dolly that Colin pushed, the actors in front of him - and maybe even the director behind him. While I was shooting the death of Michael Collins in the hills of Wicklow, with Liam Neeson in the foreground and a line of silhouetted extras in the hills beyond, one of the extras fell into a fissure in the mountain. We found out that he was uninjured, and, while waiting for a helicopter to arrive and winch him out, I set up another shot. Sarah, my daughter and my assistant on the film, berated me for my heartlessness. I tried to explain that keeping a crew down here waiting idle wouldn't help the rescue process up there. Mike said he fully expected to die on a dolly one day - and be hoisted off it and replaced as quickly as possible. Over the past few years, as Pinewood and Shepperton filled up with gizmo-driven movies, and as the camera became subsumed beneath a wealth of digital effects, his enthusiasm for some of the films he worked on waned a little. For him, nothing could replace an actor's face. But his repertoire of absurdities gained immeasurably. I always hoped that he would one day write them down - Mike Roberts: The Collected Absurdities Of A Life In Film. And now he has been tragically denied that opportunity. So maybe those of us who remember them should write them down for him. But I doubt if we could ever tell them as well. \u0095 Mike Roberts, film cameraman, born July 20 1939; died May 24 2000",

He was a specialist in the songs of his fellow Finns Sibelius and Kilpinen, many of which he recorded. He appeared in many opera roles internationally, his gifts as an actor much to the fore.</p> <p>Britain saw him on stage all too seldom. He appeared at Glyndebourne in 1956 as an imposing, if slightly too rough-hewn, Don Giovanni. He returned to the festival as, more appropriately, Don Pizarro, in Fidelio in 1959.</p> <p>At about this time, Sir John Barbirolli took a liking to Borg's voice, and afterwards frequently asked him to sing the roles of the Priest and the Angel of the Agony in The Dream Of Gerontius. When Barbirolli recorded the work in 1964, a version some consider the best of all, Borg was chosen for those bass-baritone roles. His self-evident sincerity of interpretation overcame the drawback of rather a thick accent.</p> <p>He appeared for the first time in recital in London in 1959, when his interpretations, and wholehearted powers of expression, were greatly admired. This was also the year of his debut as Count Almaviva (Le nozze di Figaro) at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, where he appeared for the following three seasons.</p> <p>Borg was born into a musical family in Helsinki, and was first taught at home by his mother; she told him to sing from the chest, not the throat. Notwithstanding this support, he chose to study chemistry rather than music.</p> <p>With the war between Finland and the Soviet Union breaking out in 1939, he was recruited to the Finnish army and served as a photographer in his platoon (photography then being his hobby). In 1945, he turned to music and studied composition at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, and voice with teachers in Copenhagen, where he was later to make his home. He gave his debut recitals in those two cities in 1947.</p> <p>Borg's opera debut followed in 1952, not in his home city - where his talents were, at first, under-appreciated - but in Aarhus, in Denmark, as Colline in La Boh\u00e8me. This led to his breakthrough, when he was invited to take the short, but plum, bass role of Prince Gremin in Yevgeny Onegin at the Royal Opera, Copenhagen, where he was immediately engaged on a regular basis.</p> <p>It was at this point that Borg's international career took wing. He was engaged to sing the oily monk Rangoni to Christoff's Boris Godunov in Issay Dobrowen's ground-breaking recording of Mussorgsky's opera for EMI in 1952. Soon, Deutsche Grammophon was on his trail, and he made a number of recordings of opera, oratorio and song for the company during the following 10 years.</p> <p>Borg was much admired in Germany and, from 1965 to 1968, was a member of the Hamburg State Opera. But he was always welcome in his native Scandinavia, and from 1960 was a member of the Stockholm Opera, where his Scarpia was much praised in 1963. In 1971, he sang Fafner and Hagen in the company's performances of Wagner's Ring. A year earlier, he sang Osmin at the Drottningholm festival, another histrionic triumph.</p> <p>He appeared in concerts at the Salzburg festival from 1956, singing Mozart, and in 1965-66 sang Pimen in Karajan's staging of Boris Godunov. His Mussorgskian credentials were also confirmed by a fine recording of Songs and Dances of Death.</p> <p>In 1972 he became professor of singing at the music academy in Copenhagen, though he had equivocal views on the art of teaching singers. He was also much in demand as an adjudicator at singing competitions. A wise and intelligent man and singer, he appreciated that musicianship was as important as voice in his art. His career confirmed that.</p> <p>He married Ebon Karin Ingeborg Ringblom in 1950; they had two children.</p> <p>\u0095 Kim Borg, bass-baritone, born August 7 1919; died April 28 2000</p>",

At about this time, Sir John Barbirolli took a liking to Borg's voice, and afterwards frequently asked him to sing the roles of the Priest and the Angel of the Agony in The Dream Of Gerontius. When Barbirolli recorded the work in 1964, a version some consider the best of all, Borg was chosen for those bass-baritone roles. His self-evident sincerity of interpretation overcame the drawback of rather a thick accent. He appeared for the first time in recital in London in 1959, when his interpretations, and wholehearted powers of expression, were greatly admired. This was also the year of his debut as Count Almaviva (Le nozze di Figaro) at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, where he appeared for the following three seasons. Borg was born into a musical family in Helsinki, and was first taught at home by his mother; she told him to sing from the chest, not the throat. Notwithstanding this support, he chose to study chemistry rather than music. With the war between Finland and the Soviet Union breaking out in 1939, he was recruited to the Finnish army and served as a photographer in his platoon (photography then being his hobby). In 1945, he turned to music and studied composition at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, and voice with teachers in Copenhagen, where he was later to make his home. He gave his debut recitals in those two cities in 1947. Borg's opera debut followed in 1952, not in his home city - where his talents were, at first, under-appreciated - but in Aarhus, in Denmark, as Colline in La Boh\u00e8me. This led to his breakthrough, when he was invited to take the short, but plum, bass role of Prince Gremin in Yevgeny Onegin at the Royal Opera, Copenhagen, where he was immediately engaged on a regular basis. It was at this point that Borg's international career took wing. He was engaged to sing the oily monk Rangoni to Christoff's Boris Godunov in Issay Dobrowen's ground-breaking recording of Mussorgsky's opera for EMI in 1952. Soon, Deutsche Grammophon was on his trail, and he made a number of recordings of opera, oratorio and song for the company during the following 10 years. Borg was much admired in Germany and, from 1965 to 1968, was a member of the Hamburg State Opera. But he was always welcome in his native Scandinavia, and from 1960 was a member of the Stockholm Opera, where his Scarpia was much praised in 1963. In 1971, he sang Fafner and Hagen in the company's performances of Wagner's Ring. A year earlier, he sang Osmin at the Drottningholm festival, another histrionic triumph. He appeared in concerts at the Salzburg festival from 1956, singing Mozart, and in 1965-66 sang Pimen in Karajan's staging of Boris Godunov. His Mussorgskian credentials were also confirmed by a fine recording of Songs and Dances of Death. In 1972 he became professor of singing at the music academy in Copenhagen, though he had equivocal views on the art of teaching singers. He was also much in demand as an adjudicator at singing competitions. A wise and intelligent man and singer, he appreciated that musicianship was as important as voice in his art. His career confirmed that. He married Ebon Karin Ingeborg Ringblom in 1950; they had two children. \u0095 Kim Borg, bass-baritone, born August 7 1919; died April 28 2000",

The Sierra Leone army yesterday said it had captured the strategic town of Lunsar, about 30 miles from the RUF headquarters at Makeni. UN aid workers reported several thousand civilians fleeing the city ahead of the advancing government forces. A communique from a summit of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States asked that the mandate of the UN mission in Sierra Leone be toughened from \"peacekeeping\" to \"peace enforcement\" and that its command be given to a West African officer. Both requests appeared in line with the wishes of the regional superpower Nigeria, which is expected to provide the bulk of the extra regional troops, bringing its force in Sierra Leone close to 6,000 and making up the largest single contingent of foreign soldiers. Many in Sierra Leone hope the Nigerians will use their considerable experience of fighting in the country to push the RUF out of the diamond fields which fund the rebels' war. But at the moment the UN's mandate technically prevents its troops from going on the offensive against the rebels except as a means of defence. Instead, they are used to secure territory captured by government forces. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, was quoted yesterday as saying that the organisation should abandon outdated concepts of neutral peacekeeping and replace them with a more muscular form of peace enforcement. The Nigerians will, in any case, take on the greater responsibility for defending Freetown as British forces are whittled down next month. The UN force commander, Major General Vijay Jetley, said yesterday that the release of a final batch of peacekeepers held hostage by the rebels frees his force to take a more robust approach to the rebels. \"We are going to consolidate and move forward,\" he said. \"The RUF are demoralised.

But it is a marriage of convenience that has the potential to end in a nasty divorce. The new Sierra Leone army, which was created after the peace accords last July, barely exists except as a collection of fresh recruits and inexperienced officers. The backbone of the government forces is provided by members of the old army which has seized power twice over the past decade before being ousted two years ago. Much of the old army then allied itself with its former enemy, the RUF, and followed the rebels' lead in committing widespread atrocities against civilians. When the two forces jointly seized Freetown at the beginning of last year, it was difficult to distinguish between them when it came to murder, rape and mutilation. Many of those soldiers are now fighting for the government against their former rebel allies, but they remain loyal to ex-military ruler Johnny Paul Koroma, who has barely hidden his ambition for greater power. Perhaps least predictable of the forces aligned with President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah is the Kamajor militia, whose members rely as much on the charms and amulets which they believe provide magic protection from bullets as the British rifles they have managed to purloin. Their leader, Samuel Hinga Norman, is also Sierra Leone's deputy defence minister.

Volker Neumann, the MP leading the Kohl slush fund inquiry, told the business magazine Capital: \"We are trying to find out whether Siemens donated cash as a gesture of thanks for the massive profits it made in East Germany.\" Siemens was suspected of bank-rolling the CDU through Swiss bank accounts, he said. Tony Paterson, Berlin Victory for Kuwaiti women A Kuwaiti woman yesterday won permission to take her fight for the right to vote and stand for election to the country's constitutional court. \"This is a great victory ... This is what we wanted,\" said Rola Dashti A year ago, Kuwait's ruler, Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, issued a decree granting women the right to vote and stand in elections in 2003. But Kuwait's parliament rejected the decree in November. Reuters, Kuwait UN in control of Congo city Rwandan and Ugandan troops yesterday started withdrawing from Kisangani, clearing the way for creation of the first demilitarised city in warring Congo under the control of the UN. Twenty unarmed UN military observers escorted Rwandan and Ugandan soldiers away from the main airport at Bangoka, 12 miles north-east of Kisangani, where they have clashed repeatedly despite being nominal allies. AP, Kigali Serbs killed in street shooting Three Serbs, including a four-year-old child, were killed in a drive-by shooting in Kosovo thought to have been carried out by an ethnic Albanian, international officials said yesterday. Two people were seriously injured in the incident, which occurred around 8:30pm local time on Sunday in the eastern village of Crnica, according to the Nato-led K-For peacekeeping force. Reuters, Pristina Cult charged for amazing feet Tokyo prosecutors yesterday indicted the founder of a religious cult who claimed to cure diseases by inspecting feet, accusing him of defrauding believers of more than \u00a3150,000, Japanese media reported. Hogen Fukunaga and seven other leaders of the Ho-no-Hana Sampogyo cult were charged with swindling five followers out of 25m yen between 1994 and 1996, according to Kyodo news agency. AP, Tokyo Hong Kong warns refugees Security officials in Hong Kong yesterday warned they will kick out Vietnamese refugees who refuse to leave their camp when it is shut down this week. The camp at Pillar Point will close at midnight tomorrow, putting an official end to the Vietnamese boat people saga, a remnant of the Vietnam war. The government had decided in February to offer permanent Hong Kong residency to the refugees and close the camp. But some refugees say they cannot afford to live anywhere in the notoriously expensive territory. AP, Hong Kong",

      "body": "<p>Goodwill between English and Turkish football fans may be in short supply at the moment, but in one west London primary school it's a very different story. </p> <p>Two boys from West Drayton Primary School recently went to Turkey as \"goodwill ambassadors\" to attend the opening of a new school, built to replace one destroyed in last August's earthquake. There they met some of the young victims of the disaster who have lost their homes, their school and, in some cases, their parents. </p> <p>\"We asked the children 'how did it feel to be in the earthquake?' and they said they were scared and upset and wanted to get away from it. Some of them got separated from their parents and they really missed them,\" says Richard Davis, 10. </p> <p>The opening of the school was a high-profile event in Turkey and the two boys were mobbed by reporters, photographers and cameramen. </p> <p>Richard from year 5 and his best friend, Dale Thomas, from year 4, went to Turkey with Dale's mother Karen, who is a governor at West Drayton Primary, and Val Ross, head of community affairs at the nearby toy and games manufacturer Hasbro. Hasbro funded the \u00a370,000 cost of building the new school in Izmit in response to a request for help from staff in its Turkish office. </p> <p>Some of the 250 children whose school was destroyed have not attended school at all since the earthquake, while others have been taught in tents or have temporarily joined another school, making for classes of 60 in its overcrowded classrooms. </p> <p>When the new term starts in September, they will have their own school again, a prefabricated building with eight classrooms and a playground with play equipment - and it will be twinned with West Drayton Primary. When Val Ross suggested that West Drayton Primary might like to become involved, says headteacher Adrian Ingham, he found it an unusual and deserving initiative. </p> <p>\"We will exchange writing between our pupils and the Turkish pupils - descriptions of their lives and so on. Eventually we would like to think that some of the children from Turkey could come here and some of our children could go there. There could certainly be an exchange of teachers as well - we are ambitious in that respect,\" says Ingham. </p> <p>\"It has the dimension of the children and all that they can learn about one another and from one another. For teachers, too, it is an opportunity for them to extend the children's learning and to develop themselves. We also have a small number of Turkish children in the school and if, through links like this, we can help them see that we understand something of their cultural background, that is very useful,\" he concludes. Fundraising for the school is another possibility. Val Ross has given an assembly at West Drayton Primary about the earthquake and told the pupils of the appalling conditions in Izmit when she first visited in October last year. </p> <p>Redevelopment has begun, but even so, linking with a school in an area that has suffered such a disaster will present particular challenges. Does Ingham think the parents of his pupils will be keen on the idea of exchange trips? \"We would have to work at this over a period of time, but why not? </p> <p> If it happens in mainland Europe, why shouldn't it happen in Turkey? It's just that it's going to have a very different flavour to it. We will need to work with our children to educate them about what the children there have been through.\" </p> <p>With the demands of the curriculum and the drive to improve standards, caring and compassion are sometimes forgotten - but in spite of the time pressures it is important to keep the broader view, he says. </p> <p>\"We're not just exam machines,\" he says, \"we're involved in developing complete human beings, as far as possible, with a view on life that goes beyond the next set of results. </p> <p>\"We serve an internationally mixed community here and many teachers believe it is our job to open the children's eyes to that. With younger children it is hard but unless we start, some of the attitudes that tend to develop - suspicion of the world abroad - will continue. And it's our job to break down some of those preconceptions.\" </p> <p>Richard and Dale are already sold on the child-friendly Turks. \"The people really like you - they pat you on the head and are kind to you and give you presents. One of the girls gave me a kiss on the cheek,\" says Richard. </p> <p>In fact, Karen, Dale and Richard loved the country so much that the two families have booked a Christmas and New Year holiday there.</p>",

When Val Ross suggested that West Drayton Primary might like to become involved, says headteacher Adrian Ingham, he found it an unusual and deserving initiative. \"We will exchange writing between our pupils and the Turkish pupils - descriptions of their lives and so on. Eventually we would like to think that some of the children from Turkey could come here and some of our children could go there. There could certainly be an exchange of teachers as well - we are ambitious in that respect,\" says Ingham. \"It has the dimension of the children and all that they can learn about one another and from one another. For teachers, too, it is an opportunity for them to extend the children's learning and to develop themselves. We also have a small number of Turkish children in the school and if, through links like this, we can help them see that we understand something of their cultural background, that is very useful,\" he concludes. Fundraising for the school is another possibility. Val Ross has given an assembly at West Drayton Primary about the earthquake and told the pupils of the appalling conditions in Izmit when she first visited in October last year. Redevelopment has begun, but even so, linking with a school in an area that has suffered such a disaster will present particular challenges. Does Ingham think the parents of his pupils will be keen on the idea of exchange trips? \"We would have to work at this over a period of time, but why not? If it happens in mainland Europe, why shouldn't it happen in Turkey? It's just that it's going to have a very different flavour to it. We will need to work with our children to educate them about what the children there have been through.\" With the demands of the curriculum and the drive to improve standards, caring and compassion are sometimes forgotten - but in spite of the time pressures it is important to keep the broader view, he says. \"We're not just exam machines,\" he says, \"we're involved in developing complete human beings, as far as possible, with a view on life that goes beyond the next set of results. \"We serve an internationally mixed community here and many teachers believe it is our job to open the children's eyes to that. With younger children it is hard but unless we start, some of the attitudes that tend to develop - suspicion of the world abroad - will continue. And it's our job to break down some of those preconceptions.\" Richard and Dale are already sold on the child-friendly Turks. \"The people really like you - they pat you on the head and are kind to you and give you presents. One of the girls gave me a kiss on the cheek,\" says Richard. In fact, Karen, Dale and Richard loved the country so much that the two families have booked a Christmas and New Year holiday there.",

The science writer Ron Kotulak, of the Chicago Tribune newspaper, has even suggested that children exposed to inner-city environments in their first three years may be having their brains permanently wired in ways that could direct them towards violence and crime. In his Pulitzer Prize-winning series in 1993, Kotulak wrote: </p> <p>\"What research can now tell us with increasing certainty is just how abuse, poverty, neglect or sensory deprivation can reset the brain's chemistry in ways that make some genetically vulnerable children more prone to violence.\" </p> <p>If parents are not able to provide the stimulation that influences early synapse and brain circuit formation by providing the right kind of early experiences for their children, then is it not incumbent upon the state to intervene so that the children do not suffer? </p> <p>Such a stance might be defensible if the science that supported it was valid.

For example, some parents in villages in Guatemala were found to have raised their children in dark huts for their first year of life.

These families are deficient in an enzyme that helps to build the penis and scrotum in the foetus. This is due to a defective gene, and boys affected by it have a stunted penis resembling a clitoris. These boys are brought up as girls until puberty, when male hormones transfer the girlish frames into mannish bodies. As soon as this happens the children switch genders, wear male clothes, pursue females and grow into normal males. This syndrome is named \"quevedoces\" (eggs at 12) by the locals. Despite their early experiences, there appears to be no problem in switching from girl to man, showing, according to Bruer, that \"early experience had not permanently wired female gender roles into the brains\" of those changing to males at 12. </p> <p>The advice to the parents of young children throughout Bruer's book is that they need to be relaxed about the stimulation they provide.

The Further Education Funding Council has just awarded it the only top Grade 1 assessment in the country since inspections began in January. Given that there are more than 400 further education colleges teaching basic reading, writing and maths in England and Wales, this is quite an accolade. Britain has one of the poorest records of functional illiteracy in Europe. At least 20% of adults cannot calculate the change from \u00a32 for a loaf of bread and two cans of beans. One in 16 cannot properly read posters, find an address or choose a meal in a restaurant. This is twice the level of functional illiteracy in Germany. </p> <p>Against this background, the funding council's chief inspector, Jim Donaldson, praised Liverpool college's high expectations of students, its method of marking and tracking success, its outstanding teacher training, retention rates and curriculum management. He said that the college would be a beacon for all other colleges. But what is interesting about the college's success is that the majority of its 3,000 basic skills students come from Liverpool 8, the most deprived postcode in Britain. Literacy rates in Liverpool are 5-10% lower than the national average and only 30% of school leavers achieve five GCSEs grades A to C. So how does the college get such success rate? </p> <p>At the Colquitt Street drop-in centre, one of the college's 11 centres across Liverpool, Jason Lunt is chewing his pencil. Lunt, 30, left school with no qualifications and hasn't worked for 10 years because of illness. He is doing a pre-GCSE comprehension exercise which challenges him to understand and follow instructions in English. \"I love it,\" he says. Across the room, Mohammed Nasser Ali, 21, is \"scanning\" a text for familiar words and looking others up in a dictionary. Gina, 18, who was excluded from school and used to work packing magazines that she could not fully read, is studying basic English vocabulary and maths to prepare her for a child-care course. </p> <p>There are 15 students in the room, aged between 16 and 60, all working on their own assignments at their own pace. Three teachers approach individuals in turn and tutor them. </p> <p>\"The drop-in centre is open from 10am till 3pm and students have individual work plans. They come in and take breaks as they want to,\" says Gale Jones, the centre manager. \"We offer individual programmes for each student. Students can start on any day of the year. Most people who come here can read a basic tabloid story. They come when they find they can't help their children with homework or are unable to write letters. They have gone through jobs by hiding their inadequacies and the last thing they need is group teaching where they are forced to compete with others.\" </p> <p>The college's success comes from a break with the norm, says Leelee Yates, Basic Skills manager. First, the college writes its own materials and markets them outside. English exercises and comprehensions are refreshed and re-written on almost an individual basis. </p> <p>\"One year, we had a lot of Liverpool football fans, so I wrote player profiles,\" says teacher Kathie Highton. </p> <p>But all teaching and materials at the 11 drop-in centres and community projects at Liverpool College is standardised. The funding council report noted that communication between the 36 full-time and 32 part-time teachers was excellent. </p> <p>The college has also rethought teacher training in basic skills. The college demands not only the national teaching certificate in basic skills, it has developed its own accredited training qualification based on practical assessment of the time management skills needed to individually tutor a room full of different students. </p> <p>\"Almost all our staff have over five years' experience and even the drop-in centre receptionists are trained in basic skills, so that applicants are interviewed within a week and avoid the bureaucracy that has caused them problems elsewhere,\" says Jones. </p> <p>Liverpool Community College principal, Wally Brown, says the college has removed the pointless stigma attached to basic skills teaching. </p> <p>\"Twenty years ago, lecturers' pay was defined by subject, and basic skills was at the bottom of the pile. Even now, there is a hierarchy in many colleges. There is an assumption that any teacher who can read and write can teach others to read and write,\" he says. \"Basic skills have been a priority in Liverpool for the last 15 years, and we have learnt that it takes time to see results from students. The govern ment is taking literacy seriously and I'm pleased about that. But the idea of quick-fix 10-week literacy summer schools is absolute nonsense.\" </p> <p>The majority of the college's intake for basic skills comes by word of mouth, says Yates. \"Retention rates are high because our atmosphere is relaxed.\" Highton refers to students as her family. \"If you teach in an inner-city centre like this, you have to be good at dealing sensitively with the emotional baggage students bring to class. If someone has had a bad night, we let them take it easy.\" </p> <p>The college is also realistic. \"Our only weakness in the inspection was low numbers of students achieving full awards,\" says Yates. \"But that is because we treat progress on an individual basis and don't think purely in terms of exams.\" </p> <p>Last year, the college advised Brookside scriptwriters when character Barbara Dennon failed to be promoted because she couldn't read. </p> <p>\"I think the writers wanted Barbara to learn to write a postcard in the first episode and sit a degree eight weeks later, we had to put a break on that one,\" laughs Yates. </p> <p>\"Our staff aren't good at blowing their own trumpets,\" says Brown. \"They just used these techniques because they worked. The Grade 1 rating should inspire other colleges to prioritise basic skills.\"</p>",

If someone has had a bad night, we let them take it easy.\" The college is also realistic. \"Our only weakness in the inspection was low numbers of students achieving full awards,\" says Yates. \"But that is because we treat progress on an individual basis and don't think purely in terms of exams.\" Last year, the college advised Brookside scriptwriters when character Barbara Dennon failed to be promoted because she couldn't read. \"I think the writers wanted Barbara to learn to write a postcard in the first episode and sit a degree eight weeks later, we had to put a break on that one,\" laughs Yates. \"Our staff aren't good at blowing their own trumpets,\" says Brown. \"They just used these techniques because they worked. The Grade 1 rating should inspire other colleges to prioritise basic skills.\"",

Any student who lived in a postcode area that fell within the top 15% of relatively deprived wards automatically qualified the college for a 6% uplift in funding.

Much of the information that a college would need to assess its financial entitlements is of a highly sensitive, if not confidential, nature and eliciting that data requires tact and diplomacy. A college can ask its students to fill in an application form on enrolment, but there are no guarantees that the information supplied will be accurate, or indeed, that a student will have the literacy skills to understand the questions and supply the answers. Many students would rather keep learning difficulties to themselves.

Small wonder then that colleges, such as Lewisham, with large numbers of widening participation students on their books, are not receiving anything like the funding that is technically owed. </p> <p>\"About 75% of widening participation students are picked up automatically through the postcode system,\" says Gravatt. \"Of the other 25%, we reckon we only manage to identify about half.\" </p> <p>Part of the problem is that at present there are no national protocols for colleges to assist in identifying students' needs and difficulties.

Je trouve qu'il est bien fait, bien organis\u00e9. Aujourd'hui on apprend \u00e0 faire le Paris-Brest et comme demain c'est l'anniversaire de ma soeur, je me suis dit que je vais pouvoir lui faire un gteau. </p> <p> <strong> Chase (7 ans) : </strong> C'est souvent les m mes enfants qui viennent. Mes parents m'ont envoy\u00e9 ici pour que j'apprenne \u00e0 faire la cuisine. Ma maman m'aide \u00e0 faire la cuisine \u00e0 la maison. Elle m'a appris \u00e0 faire des cr pes. </p> <p> <strong> Laurence (13 ans) : </strong> Je suis d\u00e9j\u00e0 venue une fois. J'avais appris \u00e0 faire les terrines de saumon et d'aubergine. Comme on a les recettes, on peut facilement les refaire chez soi. </p> <p> <strong> Natan (10 ans) : </strong> Je viens tous les mois depuis trois ans. J'aime \u00e7a, je trouve que les cours sont tr\u00e8s bien pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, qu'on fait des tr\u00e8s bonnes choses et que c'est super. </p> <p> <strong> Tu fais la cuisine \u00e0 la maison ? </strong></p> <p><strong>Vincent : </strong> Le dimanche, oui. Les plats varient selon la saison et ce que j'ai envie de faire. Par exemple, si je veux faire un fraisier un jour, je ne peux pas le faire en hiver parce qu'il n'y a pas de fraises. </p> <p> <strong> Chase : </strong> J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 appris \u00e0 faire des gteaux. J'aime faire les gteaux, en particulier le gteau \u00e0 la vanille. Je sais cuisiner des salades de crabe mais je ne me souviens plus comment. </p> <p> <strong> Laurence : </strong> Je fais beaucoup la cuisine chez moi. Mais apprendre au Ritz, c'est pas la m me chose. L'htel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 pour sa cuisine, donc \u00e7a donne plus envie que d'apprendre avec la famille. </p> <p> <strong> Natan : </strong> J'aime cuisiner les pizzas tomate mozzarella, j'en fais souvent pour ma famille. Ils pensent que c'est tr\u00e8s bon. Il y a plus de gar\u00e7ons que de filles ici. </p> <p> <strong> Vincent : </strong> C'est vrai. Je pense que la cuisine est un m\u00e9tier qui est assez masculin dans l'ensemble. </p> <p> <strong> Julien : </strong> Peut- tre que les filles ne sont pas motiv\u00e9es. </p> <p> <strong> Laurence : </strong> C'est pas normal. Il y a trois filles et sept gar\u00e7ons. La cuisine c'est un m\u00e9tier fait pour les deux. Mais moi, plus tard je veut tre avocat. </p> <p> <strong> Natan : </strong> La cuisine c'est tr\u00e8s bien pour les filles et les gar\u00e7ons.

On y p\u00e9n\u00e8tre par une petite porte discr\u00e8te \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re de l'htel. Il suffit maintenant de descendre quelques marches, de prendre un couloir \u00e9troit et on se retrouve bientt devant la pancarte qui r\u00e9v\u00e8le le secret : \u00c9cole Ritz Escoffier . Derri\u00e8re la porte \u00e0 votre gauche, vous d\u00e9couvrez une cuisine de r ve, avec son assortiment de fouets, de casseroles et de couteaux brillants. Enfilez votre tablier et votre toque, et suivez les conseils culinaires du chef Gilles Maisonneuve, professeur de ce cours de grande cuisine. Voil\u00e0, il ne vous reste plus qu'\u00e0 plonger les mains dans la farine ! Je suis all\u00e9e apprendre \u00e0 faire une ptisserie d\u00e9licieuse, le Paris-Brest, avec Gilles et mes coll\u00e8gues apprentis, Vincent, Julien, Chase, Laurence et Natan. Comment se d\u00e9roulent les cours ? Gilles Maisonneuve (chef) : On peut faire une entr\u00e9e, un plat, un dessert : par exemple des tomates en salade, une escalope de veau \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me, du riz pilaf. Ensuite en dessert, on peut avoir des melons en surprise, des ananas, des mousses de fruits. Aujourd'hui, c'est un cours de ptisserie. Je trouve \u00e7a tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able d'apprendre la cuisine aux enfants, de les voir tr\u00e8s passionn\u00e9s de venir ici pour apprendre. Ce qui est important c'est de voir qu'\u00e0 la fin du cours, l'enfant est ravi de d\u00e9guster le produit qu'il a r\u00e9alis\u00e9. C'est ton premier cours ?

They need friendly personalities and ought to be able to enjoy working with a wide range of people. They need to be capable of working under pressure and to be physically fit. </p> <p><strong> And slobs need not apply, I suppose.</strong> You've got it. Applicants should be neat and well groomed with no visible tattoos, as well as having a clear speaking voice. </p> <p><strong> Any entry requirements? </strong> It varies. Some airlines want four or five GCSEs, grades A-C, including maths and English. Minimum entry ages range from 19 to 21 years of age. Minimum height varies between 1.58m and 1.60m and some set a maximum height ranging from 1.82m to 1.87m. Applicants should have weight in proportion to their height. Some airlines have upper age limits, eg Virgin Atlantic, which is 28. And some insist that applicants can swim at least 25 metres. </p> <p><strong> How comforting.</strong> Most airlines prefer applicants to have knowledge of a second language. For British Airways conversational ability in a second language is essential. </p> <p><strong> Are there courses?</strong> Some colleges offer courses to prepare for application to work as cabin air crew. The Aviation Training Association advises caution about one- or two-day courses entitled \"How to Become Cabin Crew\". </p> <p><strong> Do the airlines train you? </strong> Yes. Each has its own training school. Training lasts between four to six weeks and continues in-flight under supervision. </p> <p> \u0095 Aviation Training Association 01494 445262 </p> <p>\u0095 British Airways 020 88974000 </p> <p>\u0095 Brittania Airways 01582 424155 </p> <p>\u0095 British Midland 01332 854565 </p> <p>\u0095 Virgin 01293 562345 </p> <p>\u0095 Aer Lingus 0208 2344333 </p> <p>\u0095 TWA Airlines 020 8140707 </p> <p>\u0095 Gulf Air 020 74081717 </p> <p>\u0095 Swissair 020 74347216 </p> <p>\u0095 Monarch Airlines 01582 400000 </p> <p>\u0095 Air France 020 87592311 </p> <p>\u0095 learndirect 0800 100900 may be able to give further information on courses.</p>",

What skills are required? Air cabin crew should be confident, polite and tactful. They need friendly personalities and ought to be able to enjoy working with a wide range of people. They need to be capable of working under pressure and to be physically fit. And slobs need not apply, I suppose. You've got it. Applicants should be neat and well groomed with no visible tattoos, as well as having a clear speaking voice. Any entry requirements? It varies. Some airlines want four or five GCSEs, grades A-C, including maths and English. Minimum entry ages range from 19 to 21 years of age. Minimum height varies between 1.58m and 1.60m and some set a maximum height ranging from 1.82m to 1.87m. Applicants should have weight in proportion to their height. Some airlines have upper age limits, eg Virgin Atlantic, which is 28. And some insist that applicants can swim at least 25 metres. How comforting. Most airlines prefer applicants to have knowledge of a second language. For British Airways conversational ability in a second language is essential. Are there courses? Some colleges offer courses to prepare for application to work as cabin air crew. The Aviation Training Association advises caution about one- or two-day courses entitled \"How to Become Cabin Crew\". Do the airlines train you? Yes. Each has its own training school. Training lasts between four to six weeks and continues in-flight under supervision. \u0095 Aviation Training Association 01494 445262 \u0095 British Airways 020 88974000 \u0095 Brittania Airways 01582 424155 \u0095 British Midland 01332 854565 \u0095 Virgin 01293 562345 \u0095 Aer Lingus 0208 2344333 \u0095 TWA Airlines 020 8140707 \u0095 Gulf Air 020 74081717 \u0095 Swissair 020 74347216 \u0095 Monarch Airlines 01582 400000 \u0095 Air France 020 87592311 \u0095 learndirect 0800 100900 may be able to give further information on courses.",

Simply changing your position in relation to the shape of your home is believed to improve your energy and health.

The aim of the project is to illustrate our relationship with and dependence on plants.

With students now the focus of Slobodan Milosevic's venom, authorities also banned all gatherings on Serbian campuses, effectively turning them into forbidden zones. </p> <p>Otpor, which means Resistance, has been a long time in the making. But the student movement of disaffected graduates and university attendees is beginning to do what no other force has yet done. It is uniting a war-weary population against the man most blamed for dragging the Balkans into anarchy. </p> <p>For supporters, who say Otpor is \"a state of mind, a way of thinking\", the omens have never looked better. This month alone Otpor-orchestrated protests, street happenings and university take-overs have plunged the regime into panic. Suddenly analysts think the movement could be the kind of kindling that will spark the revolution the country so badly needs. </p> <p>\"All the polls show there is now a great thirst for political change, but people here are very suspicious of the opposition. They see them as squabbling power-seekers who are vain and immature,\" says Milan Nicolic, director of the Belgrade-based Centre for Policy Studies. \"Otpor, by contrast, is viewed as incorrupt, bold, well-organised and aggressive. The students don't have any skeletons to hide, they have never done deals with Milosevic and their demands for change sound very legitimate in the ears of the people.\" </p> <p>Serb-watchers - a cynical bunch at the best of times - say the youth factor is what could rid the pariah state's political compass of moral imperfections. </p> <p>\"They've got nothing to lose,\" says Nicolic. \"The regime knows that, and that's what has frightened it.\" </p> <p>In a matter of weeks the movement's popularity has suddenly soared. Repression, on the back of a fresh crackdown against Belgrade's independent media, has only served to bolster support. Serbs of all ages and political persuasions have been appalled by scenes of fresh-faced students being arbitrarily arrested and bundled into police buses in towns nationwide. Reports of the maltreatment of Otpor members in custody have further infuriated a population exhausted by years of isolation and poverty. </p> <p>The government's decision, last week, to brand the youngsters as \"fascist hooligans\" and \"western-paid terrorists\" has also increased the movement's appeal. \"Otpor is as much about an idea, the idea of resistance, as anything else,\" says Vukasin Petrovic, one of the movement's ever-changing spokesmen. \"The regime can beat us, but it can't beat or control ideas, and that is the key to Otpor's success.\" </p> <p>Serbia has a student population, on paper at least, of around 250,000, although far fewer have bothered turning up to classes since the regime passed legislation in May 1998 stripping universities of their autonomy. As tenured professors, deans and de partmental heads have been ousted by government-approved replacements, thousands of students have enrolled in Belgrade's two alternative universities, which are run as underground establishments by those who lost their jobs. </p> <p>Otpor, say its founders, was the direct result of the restrictive measures. \"We started as a small protest movement in faculties and high schools,\" says Petrovic, a 23-year-old political science student at Belgrade Univer sity. \"Now we have 27,000 signed-up members and eight million activists, because Otpor is now in the minds of most of the population. People realise we are not like opposition politicians - we are not in this to promote ourselves, we just want change.\" </p> <p>Milosevic has feared student-power since hundreds of thousands of demonstrating undergraduates forced him to concede electoral fraud, and overturn the results of a municipal vote, in 1996. Now that they have re-emerged to inject a new lease of life into the opposition, he has begun to fear them even more. And experience has taught Otpor how to outwit the authorities: the movement is a network of loosely organised groups, without apparent leadership, to prevent penetration and arrests. </p> <p>\"Our [four] universities have always been overpopulated precisely because Milosevic has wanted to keep young, unemployed urban people off the streets,\" says Nicolic. \"The regime has always tried to manipulate students by appointing professors who refused to grant them credits, or pass their exams, if they took part in campus protests.\" </p> <p>Otpor's most significant weapon, so far, has been its symbol: a clenched fist that now graces more than 400,000 posters, 500,000 T-shirts and two million leaflets, match boxes and badges throughout Serbia. In some of Belgrade's recent mass demonstrations opposition leaders, including Zoran Djindjic, who heads the Democratic Party, have worn Otpor T-shirts in recognition of the movement's growing popularity. </p> <p>\"We are getting financial support from Serbs who live abroad,\" says Petrovic. Exiled youngsters, who are part of the country's growing brain-drain, have thrown their weight behind Otpor. They see it as the best vehicle to bring about political change that will allow them to return home. </p> <p>Antagonism between the activists and the authorities has been exemplified by an almost-laughable war of posters now being fought on Belgrade's streets. Anxiety over the group is such that police have often forced people in Otpor t-shirts to take them off. Activists say that despite the threat of laws to end their \"terrorist activities\", the next step will be an increasing campaign of civil disobedience. </p> <p>The regime's decision to close universities, after students threats of a mass walk-out this week, appears to have hardened the resolve of protestors fighting for democracy. Otpor activists said the measures were the clearest sign yet of the panic gripping the authorities. </p> <p>\"I don't think anything can stop us now,\" said Petrovic. \"In fact, all these measures just make us much better protestors. Over the past five years the government has destroyed a generation of students by stopping exams and classes whenever it gets afraid and frankly, we've had enough.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Last week Helena Smith was awarded a Nieman fellowship at Harvard University 2000-2001 for her coverage of Balkan affairs.</p>",
