Blunkett will this week introduce refresher courses for teachers thought to be stuck in their ways, which heads will be able to use as part of an 'MoT' for staff at the mid-point in their careers.

Its architect designed gaslights for public spaces - a nostalgic touch - but otherwise looked hopefully to the future: there were to be no fences in Newton, and the police presence would be minimal. </p> <p>The novel is set in the summer of 1973, a time when the idealism of the Sixties still has some potency. Austin Swope, the lawyer who masterminded the acquisition of land, is counting the days before he is given the job of city manager promised him. In the meantime, there are a few teething troubles to sort out with the help of his right-hand man, master builder Earl Wooten. </p> <p>Swope is white and Wooten black, but they have both known hard times and Newton is more than a career high point for both of them. They believe in it, as a model of what community should be. Their friendship is reinforced by the even closer bond between their sons, bookish, neurotic Teddy and easy-going Joel.</p> <p>The only real source of conflict between the boys is Joel's attachment to trashy beauty Susan. Teddy's image of the ideal woman seems to be Yoko Ono, an admiration which is enough to signal that his heterosexuality may not be fully formed (he must be the first person in fiction, or indeed fact, to find the cover of Two Virgins arousing). His affection for Joel may contain an element more desirous than pally. </p> <p> The New City has a thriller plot of a slow-developing sort, involving a suspicious death and the framing of an innocent man, but it also has aspirations to being a family tragedy. Between those stools it pitches its tent. Amidon's style is fluent if rarely graceful ('The pall of suspicion would scotch his ascension'), with moments of an uneasy magnificence - one character imagines 'the shell of time' breaking, 'allowing him to float freely in the eternal liquid that spilled through the cracks'. Someone at Doubleday would have saved him embarrassment by mentioning that the words simulacra and substrata are not singular. </p> <p>Swope's tragic flaws are a paranoia as much of the period as its hopefulness, and a blind love for Teddy, who was despaired of as a baby. No one thought he could survive, but Swope simply refused to let him die. Wooten's weakness seems lower down the scale: an inability to stick to the low-fat diet his wife Ardelia provides, which leads him to adultery with a woman willing to serve greasy meals. But this food obsession is more than simple greed. The trauma in his childhood was a period of desperate hunger when he was seven, after the great-aunt who was looking after him had a stroke. In her impaired state she was unable to tell anyone there was a child unprovided-for in her isolated house. </p> <p>Amidon provides a wealth of period detail but can't make the collapse of a utopian project seem anything but preordained. In fact, he embraces the inevitability he might have considered resisting. How could Newton be anything but doomed when the gaslights periodically explode into flames, Japanese beetles are eating the newly-planted saplings, and even the fish in the artificial lake go mysteriously belly-up? </p> <p>Watergate is beginning to dominate the television news, while the immediately preceding trauma of the Vietnam War continues to overshadow lives. Susan's father John is a veteran who escaped injuries during years of dangerous assignments, only to be laid low on a routine patrol by a mysterious centipede encountered in a cave. His hand never heals up, and the smell of rot which emanates from it makes problems for him in his work as an estate agent, trying to sell properties in Newton. Prospective buyers connect the bad smell with the houses rather than the realtor, and perhaps in the symbolic scheme of the novel they are justified. </p> <p>As if a suppurating wound wasn't heavily metaphorical enough, Amidon supplies a scene of fateful meeting when Swope recruits John to do his dirty work, with its own grotesque prelude: a bird flying into a window. It is killed on impact, but stays mysteriously stuck to the glass by a 'blend of histamines and corpuscles'. Slowly it descends, 'laying a vertical highway of muck on the window'. Jelly pastes the dead eye to the glass: 'as the bird moved downward the ball was slowly rolling up into the socket, exposing black veins'.</p> <p>With such an abundance of bad omens in evidence, the characters begin to look foolish, rather than tragic, in their inability to read the writing on the wall - or the sign on the Baptist church: GOOD INTENTIONS DIE UNLESS THEY ARE EXECUTED.

Nothing holds except simple criticism of quality, and in this respect Ingalls is, without doubt, a highly talented and experienced writer of fiction.</p> <p>Her work combines subtlety and horror, magic and stark realism, Greek tragedy and happily-ever-afters. Her characters are true to life even as they embody classical archetypes - Icarus, Odysseus, Psyche, people wandering too long, striving too far, watching their loved ones by faint lights.</p> <p>In Days Like Today, her tenth volume of fiction, Ingalls brings together five works linked by war and fate, although these five are as physically different as they are thematically similar. Ranging in length from a dozen to a hundred pages, some of the pieces have the elemental focus of short stories, others the psychological depth of novels. They are novellas, novelissimos, long shorts and short longs. They are the length they need to be, whatever you call them, and together they constitute something rare and fine.</p> <p>Character is Ingalls's greatest strength, and in writing there may be no better strength to have. Her people are four-dimensional, rich in pasts and hopes as well as physicality. Her narratives are relatively simple, and therefore her protagonists few. Fate overlooks them all, and conflict - urban, domestic, international - is never far away. In 'Correspondent', Joan discovers her famous war journalist husband is being unfaithful. To get her own back, or bring him back to her, she steals his pouch of lucky charms on the day he is leaving for a danger zone. What happens to him, and to her, is no more nor less than either deserves. There are echoes of Samson and Delilah here, but they are understated.</p> <p>There is also an inevitability to the ending which is typical of Ingalls's work and which, somehow, does not make it predictable. This is to do with Ingalls's interest in fate, something she goes back to again and again. In 'Veterans', the man whom Franklin saves on the battlefield returns to find him, a haunting as sinister and relentless as if the saved man had died after all.</p> <p>The single act of heroism changes and defines both their lives, as Franklin understands: 'From then on he had something in reserve that could balance everything to come. For ever afterwards he could point to that moment, telling himself: That's the kind of man I am... But who could tell what the same deed had done to Sherman? He might feel that he was under an obligation. And he might not like that.'</p> <p>The least successful story in the book - although this is relative - is also the only one that doesn't deal with war. In 'The Icon', Stratis becomes convinced that his grandfather owns a stolen painting. Although the painting is worthless and his grandfather much loved, Stratis is led on by his own impetuousness and sense of right until he steals the icon back. Possibly it is because the characters in this story are Greek-American themselves that the Hellenic methods and archetypes - Icarus, hamartia - seem too obvious. The sense of fate is also so strong that in the end it strains credibility.</p> <p>Ingalls's best-known work to date is 'Mrs Caliban', the story of a woman who falls in love with a green-skinned sea monster she finds in her kitchen: even so, the best writing in this new book doesn't deal with fictions that are stranger than truths. Quite the opposite. In her war stories, Ingalls documents truths that are stranger than fiction, and it is this that makes Days Like Today a remarkable collection.</p>",

Ingalls's best-known work to date is 'Mrs Caliban', the story of a woman who falls in love with a green-skinned sea monster she finds in her kitchen: even so, the best writing in this new book doesn't deal with fictions that are stranger than truths. Quite the opposite. In her war stories, Ingalls documents truths that are stranger than fiction, and it is this that makes Days Like Today a remarkable collection.",

Scientific studies, even when undertaken by eminent literary men, have an obsolescence which is more or less built in. We are only interested, if at all, in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica or Goethe's huge body of scientific writings on plants, anatomy and colour theory because of who they are by. Browne's ideas of why badgers have two legs shorter than the others do not have an intrinsic interest; Goethe's theory of the metamorphosis of fundamental forms in plants and skeletons is just wrong, and therefore without much interest. They go on being read, but on sufferance, as it were; they cannot be at the centre of the author's work, and were never of much interest to the science they lay claim to. </p> <p>Thoreau, however, is different, and Wild Fruits is both at the centre of his remarkable body of work and of continuing practical interest. It has been put together out of manuscript notes and the daily observations he took while striding around the Massachusetts countryside. It dates from the 1850s and seems to have been considered by Thoreau as the beginnings of a more substantial 'Kalendar', in which the details of New England wildlife would be set down and turned into a new Bible, of practical application. 'Surely it is a defect in our Bible,' he wrote in his journal, 'that it is not truly ours, but a Hebrew Bible. The most pertinent illustrations for us are to be drawn, not from Egypt or Babylonia, but from New England.' </p> <p>That was not to be but what Thoreau produced is a catalogue of wild fruits and plants, native to New England, made up of both observation and learning. His ultimate intentions were mystical. 'My profession is to be always on the alert to find God in nature, to know his lurking places,' he wrote. But his practice was always fiercely empirical. </p> <p>Nothing he cannot see on his walks is of much interest to him. But what he can see on his walks is enough. He sticks firmly to his view that what we live with is what matters to us and is hostile to the idea that anything may be imported. 'We cultivate imported shrubs in our front yards for the beauty of their berries, while at least equally beautiful berries grow unregarded by us in the surrounding fields. The tropical fruits are for those who dwell within the tropics. Their fairest and sweetest parts cannot be imported. Brought here, they chiefly concern those whose walks are through the marketplace.' </p> <p>Thoreau's inspiring, holistic vision of the strength of nature tends to make him hostile towards any form of agriculture, industry or trade. For him, nature will always win out. If a man chops down a wood, then 'in how short a time will blueberries and huckleberries grow there! - the earth is immediately reclothed with a new but miniature forest'. </p> <p>The fruits he describes draw their sweetness from the earth, or even from the air. They need no tending and possess a political and spiritual, as well as physical, nutrition. He is snooty about pears, largely because the varieties are named after duchesses, and in cultivation tend to be picked by 'the proprietor himself'. The more commonplace apple is much to be preferred; as for eating the pear, Thoreau decides he will 'have to wait till we get to pears with American names which a republican can swallow'. </p> <p>This is the first time the book has been published. It's difficult to see why, given the high reverence in which Thoreau is held by American readers. The editors mention the scrappiness of the material, and the impenetrability of Thoreau's handwriting, but they reproduce a bit of the manuscript and it isn't unreadable at all. The book has been put together from Thoreau's notes and is only the draft of a small part of what he originally conceived. It must be said, however, it forms a coherent and substantial whole and is surprisingly compelling; anything further from The Country Diary of an Edwardian Lady than this tough-minded, hard-thinking book can scarcely be imagined. </p> <p> Wild Fruits, from one point of view, is not much more than a catalogue of plants but it exerts a continuous fascination and its fascination is not entirely that of the banal literary pastoral. Thoreau is determinedly not writing for city dwellers, relaxing with the contemplation of a simpler, quieter life, but for those who walk where he walks, helping them to see what he sees.</p> <p>He is wrong, of course; his insights are not just local ones, but universal. Thoreau goes on being interesting for two reasons. The first is the general application of his ecological concerns. He was almost the first to see that 'in Wildness is the preservation of the world'. He is not just an inspiring prophet but someone of practical learning - apparently ecologists find his data of relevance to mapping the phenomenon of global warming. </p> <p>The second reason, of course, is how well he writes.

That beautiful metaphor sums up a great deal of Thoreau. Eyelashes surround an eye, and one of the most quietly pervasive ideas in the book is that this is not just a matter of a careful man observing nature, but nature looking back, calmly, at him. There is a constant sense of providence - not exactly divine providence, but more of that sense, which Darwin shared, that nature can and will look after itself.

Later in the nineteenth century, poets took to writing prose, and began to issue legislative edicts in earnest, convinced of their duty to rectify the world. Ruskin, like Carlyle and Matthew Arnold, saw himself as a sage, preaching and prophesying to the nation. As the Bible lost credibility, writers were promoted to the status of oracles, or even deities. In his last decade, Ruskin even cultivated shaggy patriarchal whiskers like those of the heroic demiurge who animates Adam on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. </p> <p>By then, however, the elderly Ruskin was incurably mad. He raged apocalyptically, smashed furniture and hurled food at his carer, Joan Severn. Repentant, he regressed to childhood, called the long-suffering Severn 'Mama', and begged her to forgive her 'little donkey boy'. This is the tragic paradox of his life and work, not very effectively sorted out by John Batchelor in a study which vacillates between biography and criticism. Ruskin's acolytes - a company which included Tolstoy, Gandhi, Proust and most of the Labour politicians elected to the House of Commons in 1906 - cherished him as a moralist, the upright conscience of industrial society. But his prescriptions for social change were at best dotty, at worst feudally nostalgic. </p> <p>Despising neoclassicism, in 1853 he ordered the citizens of Edinburgh to demolish their Georgian squares and rebuild their town in the Gothic style: pointed arches signalled godly aspiration, whereas square-cut window jambs were smug, dull and grossly worldly. In 1874, he put into practice his belief in the sanctity and sanity of manual work, assembling a gang of Oxford undergraduates to mend a muddy road at Ferry Hinksey.</p> <p>Oscar Wilde did some amateurish digging (a rehearsal, perhaps, for his later hemp-picking in Reading Gaol), while the ungrateful villagers jeered. Then the university vacation came and the incompetently repaired path reverted to mire. All Ruskin could propose, as his antidote to the iniquities of industrialism and the frenetic progress of 'the steam-whistle party', was the quaintly retro Guild of St George, with specially selected agricultural tenants cultivating plots of land. He specified that these anachronistic peasants must be 'cheerful and honest, accustomed to obey orders, and afraid of God'. </p> <p>As Batchelor makes painfully clear, Ruskin's fondness for easy remedies and alluring fictions led him to espouse sentimentality, silliness and soft porn. He set up a Ruskinian academy for girls (whom he addressed as 'My dear Birds') in Cheshire, and asked the conductor Hall\u00e9 to inculcate domestic virtue by playing them the treacly ballad 'Home, Sweet Home'.</p> <p>Hall\u00e9 railed that Ruskin preferred this 'sickly and shallow' tune to the symphonies of Beethoven. Certainly, by the 1880s he had come to prefer the coy, kitsch illustrations of Kate Greenaway to the more challenging art of Whistler (whose impressionistic nocturnes made him, though Ruskin could not see it, the successor to his juvenile idol Turner). Ruskin's only objection to Greenaway's nymphets was that they wore too many clothes. He coaxed his proteg\u00e9e to strip off their hats, shoes, mittens, and finally their frocks. </p> <p>Despite Ruskin's crazed infatuation with the anorexic teenager Rose La Touche, Batchelor claims that he was no paedophile. The reason seems to be a quibbling technicality: Lewis Carroll 'was exclusively attracted to little girls', whereas Ruskin managed to prolong his own fixations into 'the young adult life of the chosen girl'.</p> <p>Grown-up women dismayed him, and he never made love to his wife Effie, unmanned by 'certain circumstances in her person'. Usually this is thought to refer to his revulsion from her pubic hair. Batchelor speculates that the gawky bridegroom might have been baffled by the lunar mysteries of menstrual flow, or perhaps put off by what T.S. Eliot called the 'female stench'. Nevertheless, Ruskin reacted tetchily when accused of impotence. He was a vigorous and assiduous masturbator, and wrote to his friend Mrs Cowper-Temple offering a demonstration: 'I can prove my virility at once.' </p> <p>Whatever you decide about Ruskin's partiality for unfledged maidens, there's another secret sympathy between him and Lewis Carroll. At the end of his book, Batchelor remarks that Ruskin's imagination inhabited a series of private, privileged worlds, like the insulated city of Venice or that girls' school outside Manchester or his fantastical guild: he 'was working towards a total, spatial organisation, a kind of world-map called \"Ruskin\" '. Although Batchelor does not say so, this idyllic, self-absorbed garden has much in common with J.M. Barrie's Neverland and also with the Wonderland of Carroll's stories about Alice. Ruskin, prophetically intent on actualising the New Jerusalem, was actually a creator of that Victorian alternative to bleak, iron-bound reality which we call Nonsense. </p> <p>His ideas, for the most part, are - as Batchelor admits - 'sublimely silly'. What remains worth celebrating is the writing which, with its visual finesse and its visionary frenzy, transforms criticism into poetry: the rhapsodies about clouds in Modern Painters, the first enraptured glimpse of San Marco in The Stones of Venice, the fulminations against industrial filth in The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth Century, or the aerial survey of Europe from the Mediterranean to the Volga in The Nature of Gothic. </p> <p>In the year of Ruskin's centenary, we don't need more biographies of the wretched, demented man.

The novel certainly tinkles with petty vanities and is striped by barcodes of last year's allusions, from Posh and Becks to Daniela Nardini and rust-coloured pashminas. Like a Restoration play, Smile Please examines an affective but edgy clutch of friends, seen both on the urban range and marooned together for weekends in the country.

In one of the stories from his last collection, 'Soon to be a Major Motion Picture', a style queen is saved from superficiality by a fortuitous gift of Cranford and devours Gaskell's ample domesticity. Here, too, the references carry weight - Shakespeare and Austen, but from their least ingratiating works, particularly Troilus and Cressida and Mansfield Park.

Now Andrew Marr has done the same thing for BBC2. This is the book of the film.</p> <p>Marr's progress is constantly informed by history and embellished by the relevant writing of others. The exact day Britain died is not specified, nor is the author convinced that Britain is quite dead, but unless we all rise to the challenge, he's sure it pretty soon will be. That's the challenge he throws down. While Howe basks in sun-kissed aspects of the English, he is also desperate about the lot of many left behind by the Thatcher/Blair revolutions - an often racist rump of people without hope. Marr is altogether more optimistic. But then he is a Scot, apparently secure in his identity, even in the South.</p> <p>This book does something few others have achieved. Robert Cheshyre journeyed through Britain in the Eighties, Jonathan Freedland compared our constitutional chances with the Americans, and Simon Sharma analysed who we are against our reaction to Princess Diana's death. Marr has pulled their best thoughts together and woven a historical context into every step of his way across the country. Through it all his own powers of incisive observation and intelligent solution are threaded.</p> <p>It's impossible not to share his excitement for the opportunities thrown up by constitutional change. The Blair Government has taken critical bricks out of the moribund pile that doubles for the mother of Parliaments. It has extracted more bricks from the hopelessly over-centralised Britain that finally blamed and then expelled Conservative legislators from its geographical extremities. Despite the Royal Commission, the concept of a House of Lords is dead. So too is an unreformed 665-member House of Commons.</p> <p>Marr has no truck with the 'don't do it, you never know where it will end' school of political commentary. His passion is to say if the constitutional model has run out of steam, change it and respond to where the change leads.</p> <p>The same philosophy is in play as he places Britain at the epicentre of the new world of 'e-opportunity'. Charting the development of the City from colonial, family-dominated business to the multi-trillion-dollar trading and banking entity that it is now - bigger in most respects than any other financial market in the world - he demonstrates how sumptuously placed the British are to seize the money-making opportunities of the Internet.</p> <p>The City has been an increasingly homogenised marketplace for years - Germans, Japanese, Brazilians and Americans working alongside their British colleagues in an environment where nationality is irrelevant. As Marr puts it, 'as an open, risk-taking, English speaking economy, Britain has been perfectly placed for the second wave of Internet development'.</p> <p>He sees the effect of the Net 'flattening old hierarchies', linking groups of people who could never speak to each other before, and smashing the old British fetish of state secrecy with its free flow of information. Thus while the great national constitutional edifices crumble, the secrecy and the non-meritocratic hocus-pocus that gird the state about crumble with them.</p> <p>Immigration played its part in breaking the old Britain - high achieving new Britons who cannot easily be conjoined with the old nations that contributed to the British state. The top 100 are worth \u00a35bn between them. They chime with the globalising effects of the Net.</p> <p>And then there is Europe. Here Andrew Marr appears as the Blairites once were. He's a European, convinced that a regionally empowered Britain will fit an evolving new European order. He would have us in the euro as soon as possible. He is certain that with globalisation Britain is ahead of the game, able to give Europe a lead. He wants us right in, upheaving from within, sparking fundamental questioning and radical reform of European institutions.</p> <p>It's old Winston Churchill who Marr tells us was the first significant Briton to trumpet a belief in Britain being the cornerstone of a 'new United States of Europe'. No wonder dear old Margaret Thatcher found it so easy to sign the Single European Act. It's here that Marr identifies one probable culprit for our age-old failure to connect with Europe. He quotes the faceless Foreign Office bureaucrat talking of the critical founding EC conference in Sicily in 1955. 'Gentlemen, you are trying to negotiate something you will never be able to negotiate. But if negotiated, it will not be ratified. And if ratified, it will not work.'</p> <p>Needless to say, the referendum over the euro - an event that has slipped even since the book emerged from the printers - is seen as the defining moment of truth. Marr sees it as setting out the stark choice between the true death of Britain and the actual birth of opportunity in a globalising world. </p> <p>Marr is least convincing in finding solutions for the 'left out', who so dominate the England of Darcus Howe's White Tribe. I emerged from the book feeling that the expanding middle classes are going to have a great old time, but that the unemployed and ill-educated can expect nothing.</p> <p>We can see it already - the gulf between rich and poor widening and deepening. Neither Churchill's United States of Europe nor the Internet appear to hold much hope for them. An English Parliament, a federal republic, a written constitution - Andrew Marr has no exact picture of where it all leads. But he is certain about where we are headed if we don't go with the flow, 'a chilly churchyard of the mind, throwing handfuls of clay on the Union flag'.</p>",

Immigration played its part in breaking the old Britain - high achieving new Britons who cannot easily be conjoined with the old nations that contributed to the British state. The top 100 are worth \u00a35bn between them. They chime with the globalising effects of the Net. And then there is Europe. Here Andrew Marr appears as the Blairites once were. He's a European, convinced that a regionally empowered Britain will fit an evolving new European order. He would have us in the euro as soon as possible. He is certain that with globalisation Britain is ahead of the game, able to give Europe a lead. He wants us right in, upheaving from within, sparking fundamental questioning and radical reform of European institutions. It's old Winston Churchill who Marr tells us was the first significant Briton to trumpet a belief in Britain being the cornerstone of a 'new United States of Europe'. No wonder dear old Margaret Thatcher found it so easy to sign the Single European Act. It's here that Marr identifies one probable culprit for our age-old failure to connect with Europe. He quotes the faceless Foreign Office bureaucrat talking of the critical founding EC conference in Sicily in 1955. 'Gentlemen, you are trying to negotiate something you will never be able to negotiate. But if negotiated, it will not be ratified. And if ratified, it will not work.' Needless to say, the referendum over the euro - an event that has slipped even since the book emerged from the printers - is seen as the defining moment of truth. Marr sees it as setting out the stark choice between the true death of Britain and the actual birth of opportunity in a globalising world. Marr is least convincing in finding solutions for the 'left out', who so dominate the England of Darcus Howe's White Tribe. I emerged from the book feeling that the expanding middle classes are going to have a great old time, but that the unemployed and ill-educated can expect nothing. We can see it already - the gulf between rich and poor widening and deepening. Neither Churchill's United States of Europe nor the Internet appear to hold much hope for them. An English Parliament, a federal republic, a written constitution - Andrew Marr has no exact picture of where it all leads. But he is certain about where we are headed if we don't go with the flow, 'a chilly churchyard of the mind, throwing handfuls of clay on the Union flag'.",

According to evidence given to the Commons environment select committee, Asda set up a meeting with then council leader Graham Stringer - now a Minister in the Cabinet Office - and offered the authority money for the land 'because they did not want the extra competition'.</p> <p>Had Asda's bid been successful it could have faced an investigation by competition authorities. The council refused the offer and sold the land to Kwik Save.</p> <p>Asda denied it acted anti-competitively saying it wanted the land to increase 'flexibility for expansion'. But the Minister wrote to the committee standing by his version of the events. He said: 'The account given by Asda is at variance with my recollection. I was present at the meeting with Howard Bern stein, who is now the chief executive of Manchester City Council. I have checked with Mr Bernstein and he, without prompting from me, said Asda offered money to Manchester City Council because they did not want the extra competition which Kwik Save would have provided.'</p> <p>The disclosure will be highly embarrassing for Norman who, as chairman of Asda, would have been ultimately responsible for a deal that would have resulted in less competition for consumers and local residents.</p> <p>Norman is also under fire for a 'horrendous' environmental record as chairman of Asda and previously as a director of Kingfisher, the retail group that owns B&amp;Q, Woolworths and Comet. Last year Asda was bought by US supermarket giant Wal-Mart, renowned for its large out-of-town stores and damage to many local communities in the US. In the last decade Asda has built dozens of stores outside town centres. These have been condemned by environmentalists for ripping up the countryside and generating traffic pollution.</p> <p>Until Hague gave Norman the environment brief last week he remained a consultant to Wal-Mart-Asda. While he was still involved with the company, Wal-Mart-Asda's plans have included proposals to build a 100,000 sq ft retail park on the edge of Stevenage. This scheme is linked to massive housing development that would lead to the largest loss of green belt land ever seen in the UK.</p> <p>Two other new stores planned by Wal-Mart-Asda are under attack. One in Southport, Merseyside, is being opposed by Friends of the Earth, who argue that the 180,000 sq ft site will generate excessive traffic, much of it running through conservation sites including the Ribble Estuary Special Protection Area. A third proposal in Cannock, Staffordshire, is being opposed by the local community . The 76,000 sq ft store will mean the loss of a sports field and green spaceand the demolition of a community centre and school. The road where the store is to be located already exceeds air quality limits.</p> <p>While Norman was at Kingfisher he was chairman of its property subsidiary Chartwell Land. This company was a key player in building a large number of out-of-town retail parks on greenfield sites.</p> <p>Labour, Liberal Democrats and environmentalists have labelled Norman the 'greenbelt destroyer' and believe it is inappropriate for him to talk on the environment.</p> <p>Although the Tory environment spokesman sold his shareholding in Wal-Mart-Asda last week, he has kept his investments in a company called Knutsford - an investment firm set up to take over ailing retail companies. He declared his directorship of Knutsford in the Register of Members Interests but has failed to disclose his 9 per cent shareholding in this company. Parliamentary rules insist Members of Parliament declare shareholdings if they amount to more than 1 per cent of the company.</p> <p>Critics of Hague's decision to appoint a man with such business interests - Norman was also a director of Railtrack - to such a sensitive post also point to Norman's links to the controversial party treasurer Michael Ashcroft. Norman's key partner in Knutsford is businessman Nigel Wray who sits on the board of one of Aschroft's key companies, Carlisle plc.</p> <p>antony.barnett@observer.co.uk</p>",

According to evidence given to the Commons environment select committee, Asda set up a meeting with then council leader Graham Stringer - now a Minister in the Cabinet Office - and offered the authority money for the land 'because they did not want the extra competition'. Had Asda's bid been successful it could have faced an investigation by competition authorities. The council refused the offer and sold the land to Kwik Save. Asda denied it acted anti-competitively saying it wanted the land to increase 'flexibility for expansion'. But the Minister wrote to the committee standing by his version of the events. He said: 'The account given by Asda is at variance with my recollection. I was present at the meeting with Howard Bern stein, who is now the chief executive of Manchester City Council. I have checked with Mr Bernstein and he, without prompting from me, said Asda offered money to Manchester City Council because they did not want the extra competition which Kwik Save would have provided.' The disclosure will be highly embarrassing for Norman who, as chairman of Asda, would have been ultimately responsible for a deal that would have resulted in less competition for consumers and local residents. Norman is also under fire for a 'horrendous' environmental record as chairman of Asda and previously as a director of Kingfisher, the retail group that owns B&amp;Q, Woolworths and Comet. Last year Asda was bought by US supermarket giant Wal-Mart, renowned for its large out-of-town stores and damage to many local communities in the US. In the last decade Asda has built dozens of stores outside town centres. These have been condemned by environmentalists for ripping up the countryside and generating traffic pollution. Until Hague gave Norman the environment brief last week he remained a consultant to Wal-Mart-Asda. While he was still involved with the company, Wal-Mart-Asda's plans have included proposals to build a 100,000 sq ft retail park on the edge of Stevenage. This scheme is linked to massive housing development that would lead to the largest loss of green belt land ever seen in the UK. Two other new stores planned by Wal-Mart-Asda are under attack. One in Southport, Merseyside, is being opposed by Friends of the Earth, who argue that the 180,000 sq ft site will generate excessive traffic, much of it running through conservation sites including the Ribble Estuary Special Protection Area. A third proposal in Cannock, Staffordshire, is being opposed by the local community . The 76,000 sq ft store will mean the loss of a sports field and green spaceand the demolition of a community centre and school. The road where the store is to be located already exceeds air quality limits. While Norman was at Kingfisher he was chairman of its property subsidiary Chartwell Land. This company was a key player in building a large number of out-of-town retail parks on greenfield sites. Labour, Liberal Democrats and environmentalists have labelled Norman the 'greenbelt destroyer' and believe it is inappropriate for him to talk on the environment. Although the Tory environment spokesman sold his shareholding in Wal-Mart-Asda last week, he has kept his investments in a company called Knutsford - an investment firm set up to take over ailing retail companies. He declared his directorship of Knutsford in the Register of Members Interests but has failed to disclose his 9 per cent shareholding in this company. Parliamentary rules insist Members of Parliament declare shareholdings if they amount to more than 1 per cent of the company. Critics of Hague's decision to appoint a man with such business interests - Norman was also a director of Railtrack - to such a sensitive post also point to Norman's links to the controversial party treasurer Michael Ashcroft. Norman's key partner in Knutsford is businessman Nigel Wray who sits on the board of one of Aschroft's key companies, Carlisle plc. antony.barnett@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>The courtroom off the Strand, we are meant to be thinking about David Irving. He is a fortnight into his marathon libel action against Penguin books and Deborah Lipstadt; her book on Holocaust denial accused him of being a dangerous 'revisionist' who distorted historical evidence. But last week, in those friendly, jostling moments as we took our coats off and fumbled for pencils and waited for Mr Justice Gray, we spoke only of J\u00f6rg Haider.</p> <p>'If Irving wins, and Haider wins, then ... what?' Soon the court was in session, and the big binders of documents were being fingered by judge, counsel and witness with snuffling English patience. 'I will need my L2 back now, will I not? ... You give us the reference for that on page 613 of ND3052-PS?' But somewhere among the papers was a new message from Austria.</p> <p>I thought of a talk I had years ago with the late Bruno Kreisky. He was out of office at the time, a red-headed Galician Jew who rose to become the Social-Democrat Chancellor of Austria, who was violently critical of Israel, who loved the company of journalists.</p> <p>'Listen,' he said. 'Upper Austria is all mountains full of bone-headed Germans with Nazi instincts. Lower Austria is flat and full of grown-up, normal Czechs and Magyars and Slovaks and gypsies and Jews. All you have to do is make sure the decent lot stay on top of the mad lot.'</p> <p>Bruno Kreisky's secret system, if he ever took it seriously, has now broken down. What he did take seriously was his faith in a sceptical, tolerant sort of politics, in citizens who laughed and then yawned when demagogues tried out the charisma. And that is breaking down too.

      "bodyText": "The courtroom off the Strand, we are meant to be thinking about David Irving. He is a fortnight into his marathon libel action against Penguin books and Deborah Lipstadt; her book on Holocaust denial accused him of being a dangerous 'revisionist' who distorted historical evidence. But last week, in those friendly, jostling moments as we took our coats off and fumbled for pencils and waited for Mr Justice Gray, we spoke only of J\u00f6rg Haider. 'If Irving wins, and Haider wins, then ... what?' Soon the court was in session, and the big binders of documents were being fingered by judge, counsel and witness with snuffling English patience. 'I will need my L2 back now, will I not? ... You give us the reference for that on page 613 of ND3052-PS?' But somewhere among the papers was a new message from Austria. I thought of a talk I had years ago with the late Bruno Kreisky. He was out of office at the time, a red-headed Galician Jew who rose to become the Social-Democrat Chancellor of Austria, who was violently critical of Israel, who loved the company of journalists. 'Listen,' he said. 'Upper Austria is all mountains full of bone-headed Germans with Nazi instincts. Lower Austria is flat and full of grown-up, normal Czechs and Magyars and Slovaks and gypsies and Jews. All you have to do is make sure the decent lot stay on top of the mad lot.' Bruno Kreisky's secret system, if he ever took it seriously, has now broken down. What he did take seriously was his faith in a sceptical, tolerant sort of politics, in citizens who laughed and then yawned when demagogues tried out the charisma. And that is breaking down too. The worst thing about J\u00f6rg Haider is not his beliefs but his believers. Do David Irving and J\u00f6rg Haider have much in common? In style and personality they are opposites. Irving is a genuine maverick, a man who goes looking for burning decks to stand on. In court, we have so often heard him snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

      "body": "<p>Another week, another Internet company floats and sees its share price soar on the twin thermals of unfettered PR and desperate investor demand. But as the share price of Oxygen, the Internet incubator fund which aims to invest in university start-ups, headed North last Friday, investors might have been forgiven for experiencing more than a glimmer of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu . </p> <p>Oxygen, after all, is another company created by Michael Edelson, the chairman of Knutsford, whose share price soared from 2p to 232p in one day last year as former Asda chairman Archie Norman and three other high-profile entrepreneurs bought into it. </p> <p>But perhaps Oxygen is more like another company formed by Edelson - Media Content, a business which specialises in advising on sports rights over the Internet and which has seen its share price jag north as investors in chat rooms speculate about possible, as yet inchoate, deals. </p> <p>Interestingly, Media Content, formerly the Wilmslow Group, started life as a very different company. At one stage in its putative history it owned the Quasar sportswear brand. Admittedly, back then it was little more than a shell company designed to facilitate the reverse takeover of private companies, thus giving them a stock market listing. But it is a sign of how feverish investment is becoming in 'dot.com' stocks that Media Content's share price rose from 6p to 35p last month thanks to expectation about its potential to be a key Internet player. </p> <p>Edelson is a shrewd operator, so the hype in this instance does at least have substance. But it is perhaps an indication of how similar some of today's investors have become to those caught up in the tulip mania of Seventeenth Century Holland that many companies can now seemingly announce a complete overhaul of their business strategy almost overnight without anyone daring to mention the words 'emperor', 'no' and 'clothes'. </p> <p>Indeed, not only do investors fail to question the rationale for a firm's decision when it announces a Paulean desire to turn itself into a new-technology business, they actually rush to buy its shares with lemming-like devotion. Take Whittard's. The tea company saw its share price leap 40 per cent after Ant Factory, an Internet incubator fund, revealed that it was taking a stake. And this was one of the more sensible examples. </p> <p>Heard the one about the shoe company which, in all seriousness, recently issued a press release stating it was looking at developing Wireless Application Protocols - the standards which govern how mobile phones will interface with the World Wide Web? Well, bizarrely, the Fii Group saw its share price jump from 33p to 111p over last month, such was investor enthusiasm for this apparent volte face. </p> <p>Nor is this is the first time the Fii Group has diversified out of the depressed shoe market. Back in 1988 it bought into a bloodtesting company which it later sold on.

      "bodyText": "Another week, another Internet company floats and sees its share price soar on the twin thermals of unfettered PR and desperate investor demand. But as the share price of Oxygen, the Internet incubator fund which aims to invest in university start-ups, headed North last Friday, investors might have been forgiven for experiencing more than a glimmer of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu . Oxygen, after all, is another company created by Michael Edelson, the chairman of Knutsford, whose share price soared from 2p to 232p in one day last year as former Asda chairman Archie Norman and three other high-profile entrepreneurs bought into it. But perhaps Oxygen is more like another company formed by Edelson - Media Content, a business which specialises in advising on sports rights over the Internet and which has seen its share price jag north as investors in chat rooms speculate about possible, as yet inchoate, deals. Interestingly, Media Content, formerly the Wilmslow Group, started life as a very different company. At one stage in its putative history it owned the Quasar sportswear brand. Admittedly, back then it was little more than a shell company designed to facilitate the reverse takeover of private companies, thus giving them a stock market listing. But it is a sign of how feverish investment is becoming in 'dot.com' stocks that Media Content's share price rose from 6p to 35p last month thanks to expectation about its potential to be a key Internet player. Edelson is a shrewd operator, so the hype in this instance does at least have substance. But it is perhaps an indication of how similar some of today's investors have become to those caught up in the tulip mania of Seventeenth Century Holland that many companies can now seemingly announce a complete overhaul of their business strategy almost overnight without anyone daring to mention the words 'emperor', 'no' and 'clothes'. Indeed, not only do investors fail to question the rationale for a firm's decision when it announces a Paulean desire to turn itself into a new-technology business, they actually rush to buy its shares with lemming-like devotion. Take Whittard's. The tea company saw its share price leap 40 per cent after Ant Factory, an Internet incubator fund, revealed that it was taking a stake. And this was one of the more sensible examples. Heard the one about the shoe company which, in all seriousness, recently issued a press release stating it was looking at developing Wireless Application Protocols - the standards which govern how mobile phones will interface with the World Wide Web? Well, bizarrely, the Fii Group saw its share price jump from 33p to 111p over last month, such was investor enthusiasm for this apparent volte face. Nor is this is the first time the Fii Group has diversified out of the depressed shoe market. Back in 1988 it bought into a bloodtesting company which it later sold on. As one person sympathetic to the company explained: 'What's the point of being a plc and having access to capital markets if you are moribund. You should look at doing new things.' But what about Blakes Clothing, the ailing fashion chain once held up as Next's main rival, whose share price was languishing at around 7p on 11 January? The share price had rocketed up to the pound mark by the following week as Blakes announced plans to become an e-commerce investment group. Perhaps the most surreal example of this new sport of .com bandwagon jumping was shown by the Black Country metal bashing company Arthur Shaw, whose share price jumped from around 6p at the start of last December to 18p just before Christmas. Why? Because the company, which specialised in making window latches, announced that it no longer wanted to just make window latches. No, it had decided to team up with a former rock promoter to broadcast concerts over the Internet. Perhaps it got the idea from Svennsk Copper, the Swedish mining company, which has now decided it is to stop dig ging chunks out of the ground and will instead focus on becoming a major Internet investor.

The explosive growth of e-commerce suggests that Huxley was right. The reason is that online trading is giving rise to a spectacular erosion in personal privacy - something once memorably described by the United States Supreme Court Judge William O. Douglas as 'the beginning of all freedom'. Most Internet users nowadays don't realise the extent to which every click they make on commercial sites is monitored, logged, stored - and used to create secret profiles of them which can then be sold to other companies. Their innocence can be inferred from the astonishment - nay, outrage - they express when informed about the 'cookie' system. When you visit commercial websites, many of them will try to place a small packet of data (called a 'cookie' for some reason) on your hard disk. This is (they claim) to improve the service they provide, for example by 'recognising' you the next time you call, or eliminating the tiresome necessity of your having to type in a password on every visit. Whatever the rationale, though, the fact is that the cookie system enables complete strangers to write stuff on your hard disk in a form that can be read by other strangers on the next site you visit. Outrageous, isn't it? The e-commerce boys will seek to reassure you by saying that you can always opt out of the system by configuring your browser to reject cookies.

      "body": "<p>Most of us hold in our heads the chilling image of the doctor, standing at the ramp of the concentration camps, performing the selection of arriving Jews. Some to the left, some to the right; some to precarious survival, the rest to immediate death. It is the world turned upside down; the healer as murderer, death as an efficient bureaucratic process. In Auschwitz and other death camps, the physician was a crucial figure in the destruction of the boundary between life and death. He gave genocide the language of health and therapy; he turned mass murder into 'medicalised killing'. And deaths by injection, usually of morphine-scopolamine, were regarded as the most 'medical' deaths of all.</p> <p>The camps were 'health services' with 'outpatient centres', 'waiting rooms' and 'hospital areas'; Hitler was the highest-ranking physician. Forms were meticulously filled out. Each individual death had its fraudulent certificate. Suicides were regarded as grave errors in the system - death was a medical process administered upon the Jews, who were seen as numbers, errors to be expunged. The Nazi doctors could still think of themselves as diligent functionaries, not murderers. In the murderous logic of the Nazi Holocaust, death and life were reversed and the doctors were the gatekeepers between these worlds of the living and the dead.</p> <p>Harold Fred Shipman has been found guilty of killing 15 women, many of them elderly. Police are, at the most recent count, inquiring into 131 more deaths. He is suspected of killing at least 150 of his patients, and one estimate by a coroner even put the number at 1,500. There has never been a case like it: the unprecedented scale; the apparently motiveless slaughter. If the house of Fred and Rosemary West was like an abattoir and a torture chamber, unimaginable horrors taking place in its damp and dark basement, the surgery of Harold Shipman in Hyde was the well-lit, brightly painted centre of operations, where deaths were processed, certificates falsified, computer records backdated. Murder was tracked through audit trails and medical cards and toxicology; the quantity of diamorphine in the blood of the corpses that were disinterred, the long names of unfamiliar drugs. The women were all killed in the same methodical, doctorly way. There would have been no struggle, no terrifying gap in which they would have realised what was being done to them, no violence except for the ultimate violence of murder.</p> <p>Harold Shipman is a smallish, thinnish man with a respectable paunch. He has a pale grey beard and dark grey, thinning hair and wears grey-brown suits, conservative ties, thick-lensed spectacles. With his dry and narrow face, his scratchy, pedantic voice, his tetchy manner, he is like an old-fashioned schoolteacher or a middle-ranking civil servant. During the 57-day trial, he thrummed his fingers on the table, wrote neatly, incessantly, in his notebook, frowned irritably or sarcastically when someone got the medical terminology wrong, became petulant when he was caught out. He seemed as respectable and English as a rainy Sunday afternoon.</p> <p>His patients knew him as a diligent and courteous man, a polite man, a perfect gentleman, the embodiment of a good doctor. He was the secretary of the local Medical Council, the chair of the school's Parent Teacher Association, a member of the Canal Society. He likes figures, he likes lists, he likes organisations, he likes order - he's brilliant at Trivial Pursuits. He has a passion for objects, things; people become items in his murderous catalogue ('this lady's gone', he said of one victim, flicking her eyelid). According to the forensic psychologists who examined him, he needs control. He is addicted to death.</p> <p>The murders he committed were quiet, methodical, secret murders - as the judge described in his anguished summing-up, the women that he killed probably held out their arms and thanked him as he slid the needle into their veins: the prick of death. Like the nurse Beverly Allitt's child-victims, they would never have known they were being murdered. They all trusted their doctor; the sick man who came to heal their sickness. He was a wolf in shepherd's clothing. We stare at the surface, trying to see the horror beneath; the terrifying heart.</p> <p>Harold Shipman was born in Nottingham in 1946 and grew up in a council house. His father was a lorry driver. With his mother Vera's encouragement, he won a place at the grammar school where he worked hard, played rugby, never had a girlfriend. He was his mother's favourite, but when he was 17 Vera Shipman died of cancer. During her last months of agony, he would watch as she sat in her chair while the doctor injected her with pain-relieving morphine. Later, of course, he became the doctor, injecting morphine into the veins of other elderly women as they sat fully dressed in their chairs. In this terrible tableau that he re-enacted so many times, growing more blatant as he went, was he murdering the patients because they weren't his mother? Was he killing her over and over again, or bringing his dear mother back to life again by mimicking that vividly particular moment of his past?</p> <p>It seems too neat and too artistic to be true - a spooky Hitchcockian version of the birth of a murderer, the mummy's boy becoming psycho. For the pains and disappointments and traumas that Harold Shipman experienced are just the stuff of life. Nobody escapes them. They are retrospective explanations that can never really tell us how it was that one unremarkable boy from Nottingham became Western Europe's most prolific murderer, working as hard at his lethal hobby as he had worked at his medical studies.</p> <p>Serial killings often do appear like garish fictions, and the killers like trashy artists bent on recreating the same scene, over and over again. They have their own grotesque 'signatures', they often arrange the bodies to dramatise their own dark fantasies (they remove limbs, cut off breasts, disfigure faces). The American psychologist and detective Robert Keppel says that serial killers usually 'have a compulsion to leave their own personal stamp. The killer's personal stamp takes the form of his unique signature, an imprint left by him at the scene'. They may, he says, carve on the body, bludgeon it, leave messages written in blood, rearrange the position of the victim, performing post-mortem activities which suit their own personal desires.</p> <p>The Wests buried their young female victims upright, in blasphemously vertical coffins; they took away knee and foot bones. Dr Shipman - seating the women, fully dressed, on a chair, and injecting them with morphine - turns the women into his dying mother. Or perhaps he turns them into his wife, the woman he met soon after Vera died, and who looked matronly and middle-aged even as a teenager. And he turns the dead women into lists, catalogues, items on medical cards that are filed away. The 'trophies' he is suspected of taking away from some of the murder scenes are not bits of the body, as with many serial killers, but objects like rings, bracelets, money.</p> <p>The day that his mother died, Harold Shipman ran all night, pounding the road in the driving rain. Then he seemed to get on with his life - working hard, getting into Leeds University, becoming a doctor. He met Primrose Mary Oxtoby at a bus stop, when he was a 20-year-old medical student and she was a 16-year-old window dresser. She had never had a boyfriend before. She soon fell pregnant, to the dismay of her Methodist family, and when she was 17 the pair married, three months before the birth of their daughter Sarah. At the moment of his apparently triumphant upward mobility, the young medic married the barely literate woman from the world he seemed to have escaped. Shipman's life reads like a mixture of Thomas Hardy and Thomas Harris.</p> <p>It seems that Primrose lost her family and her previous existence when she married: she moved into his narrow world, became the doctor's wife, bringing up his children, sometimes helping out in the surgery. They had three more children (Christopher, David and Samuel). Harold finished his training. In 1971 he qualified as a doctor. In 1974 he became a GP in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. It was here he suffered a glitch in his career, for it was discovered he had been forging prescriptions for the pain-killing drug pethidine, to which he had become addicted. He admitted everything, checked into hospital, and pleaded guilty to forging prescriptions and stealing drugs.</p> <p>In 1977, 'rehabilitated', the couple moved with their growing family to the outskirts of Manchester. Here he became the 'good doctor' of Hyde, adored by his patients who flooded his surgery with letters of support after he was arrested. Even today, in an age when we distrust experts and question authority, doctors are like magicians, with their mysterious kit of tools and potions, their secret vocabulary, their impenetrable handwriting, their hidden knowledge. They can cure and listen. They know our pains and indignities, intimate details about our bodies and our lives. We believe in the doctor, and often become helpless before them. This relationship of subservience and authority gives the doctor great power. Dr Richard Nicholson of The Bulletin of Medical Ethics , asks us to consider how 'nice, intelligent schoolchildren, who go into medicine for humanitarian reasons, are 10 years later working in a system where for the most part questions are not encouraged. Where it is too easy to become arrogant and to stop thinking of patients as human beings, but as symptoms and problems; not human beings like us, but biological processes, objects.'</p> <p>It became a horrible thought through the trial that maybe this small, neat, pedantic man had killed 15 women (and how many more?) because they got on his nerves; needed tidying away. As if they were not people in his mind but symptoms and problems: a cold, a cancer, a heartburn, an ache, an irritation and a worry. Can evil be as terrifyingly banal as all that?</p> <p>Primrose is much larger than her husband; if they stood together, which now they never will, she would dwarf him. During the trial, she mostly dressed in sludge-coloured clothes. She has a pudding-bowl of greying hair and a doughy, grey face. Every day, she took her seat at the front of the public gallery and stared. Even when he collapsed into the dock to cry, coming up minutes later with a reddened nose and a pallid face, she stared and didn't look down and didn't flinch. I didn't see love or hate or pity or horror on her unreadable face. No amazement or anger. She was a loyal wife, a large and lonely figure, a closed book. Who can imagine what her life will be now - or the life of the four children, who woke up one day to find their respectable father was a serial killer? How do you remake your life after that, when his blood runs in your veins? What is your inheritance?</p> <p>Photographs of Primrose when young show that she never looked like a spring flower. She always looked unglamorous and safely unsexual. While the Wests and Myra Hindley lived in a perversely sexualised world, the Shipmans seemed to those that knew them to live in the opposite: a calmly de-sexed one. He was the overworked doctor (she even sometimes called him 'doctor' rather than 'Fred', his usual name to friends), she the overweight wife, dousing any hints of sexuality or youth in too much flesh and shapeless clothes. He would leave the bleak-ish semi-detached house early for the work he loved, coming back in the evening to collapse in front of the TV while she made dinner. They rarely went out together. It appears to outsiders to have been a life where the flame had been turned down low.</p> <p>Even those few minutes surrounding the murders were ones of secret negative pleasures or relief from extreme tension. Not for Harold Shipman the prolonged sexual frenzy of most serial killers, the grotesque drawn-out euphoria. With the Wests, or Myra Hindley and Ian Brady, or Peter Sutcliffe, the extreme sadism was like a Hieronymous Bosch canvas on which the darkest horrors of a mind were daubed. In the Shipman case there was no convulsive surface. For a long time, the murders were never even perceived as such: unnatural was thought to be natural. In a way that unsettles and induces guilt, we can understand extreme sexual perversion better than we can understand this quiet, polite, secret slaughter.</p> <p>One of the most shocking things about the long trial was how Shipman did not become a figure of horror, the stuff of our nightmares. We think serial killers should look different from us. We want them to look inhuman because we want to think of them as inhuman - removed from us, bestial or evil. 'They were not beasts but men, and what they did was a product of specific human ingenuity,' writes Robert Jay Lifton in his book about Nazi doctors. 'They were not demonic figures,' says an Auschwitz survivor of the Nazi doctors. 'What was demonic was that they were not demonic.' Thomas Harris's hero-monster, Hannibal Lecter, has six fingers and purple eyes and the uncanny grace of a panther. Myra Hindley was abhorred not just for what she did, but because of that photograph of her, with the blond wig and heavy make-up, transforming her into an icon of sexualised and perverse female evil. Her partner in crime, Ian Brady, remained a vague, shadowy figure.</p> <p>Other children are killed by children, but it was James Bulger who tugged at all our heartstrings because he was caught on a grainy security video in the shopping centre, his small hand trustingly in the older child's hand - a lamb to the slaughter; we saw the image going round and round on a loop, so that it felt as if it was still going on. Peter Sutcliffe had a chalk-white face and a black beard and ghastly voices roaring in his head. Threadbare, grey Dr Shipman looks like an identikit picture of ordinariness and respectability - an image that is an anti-image.</p> <p>Beyond this, Shipman was less horrifying to us because of who he killed. All of the victims were women, many of them elderly. In newspapers, they were frequently all called old, thus shamefully bundled together and tidied away with that one epithet, even though one, Bianka Pomfrett, was just 49, which is hardly even middle-aged, and her face that now gazes from the rows of photographs in newspaper pages looks young and thoughtful.</p> <p>We expect old people to die. We think of them as if they are in death's waiting room. When the young die, it is their future as well as their present that we mourn. The old are supposed to be ready for death, relinquishing turbulent, fretful life for peaceful, easeful oblivion. Shipman's victims were unnoticed victims for a disquieting stretch of time; murders that we didn't call murders.</p> <p>Even once the trial began, there was sparse coverage in most newspapers. People's reactions often seemed to be not ones of pity or fear, but of distaste. In Hyde last week, just before the verdict was reached, many of Harold Shipman's patients were even saying that they would return to him if they could. 'I'd go back tomorrow,' says one woman, scowling at me ferociously in the market place. 'I don't know about those murders, to me he was always a good doctor.' 'A perfect gentleman,' says another. 'And anyway, only God can know why he did it.' 'The best doctor, always there. Couldn't put a foot wrong.' These people aren't saying he didn't do it. They are close to saying that it doesn't really matter.</p> <p>Shipman is on suicide watch in prison, but warders apparently say he will not be at great risk from other prisoners. He hasn't killed children. He has only killed elderly women.</p> <p>There has never been a time, in the Western world, when we have denied age and death as we do today. We want to live longer and longer, forever. Once we valued age and wisdom; now we value youth, newness, and we dread old age, the lines on the face, life marking us: not just closer to death but further away from what we think of as life. Instead of thinking of the elderly as full of years, it is as if the more years we have, the emptier of life we become - we are using it up, running out of life and out of time.</p> <p>Ronald Blythe, in his wonderful book about old age, The View in Winter , points out that it used to be the exception to go grey, to live through the menopause, to retire, to become senile. There was a sense of the precariousness and preciousness of life, which could end at any time. To live to old age was extraordinary. Now old age is expected, ordinary - and thus contemptible. One in 10 people are over 60; by 2050, one in five will be over 60. And there are many more old women than old men.</p> <p>Simone de Beauvoir, in her sombre The Coming of Age , writes that when old people speak of the elderly they never use the word 'we', always 'they'. She writes about how we avoid the old; it is society's 'secret shame'. Today, in the year 2000, it seems as if we think of the old in the same, brutal way that we used to think of the poor in the nineteenth century: as an intractable problem, a burden. What shall we do with the hordes of people who have left the blessed land of youth?</p> <p>Age Concern has produced surveys on the media's attitudes towards the old. In a report on older people on tele vision ('Fading Out of the Picture'), they revealed that older people appear on television three times less, proportionally, than you would expect them to given their real life numbers. Older women are particularly neglected (70 per cent men to 30 per cent women). What is more, the characters they represent in dramas are often stereotyped (they moan, forget, dwell on the past, are doting and sweet and dotty_). The picture is slightly better in newspapers, where news stories about older people are not neglected. However, the concept of what stories are worth telling has not been updated: older people are mostly depicted as victims, frail objects of pity. The headlines above the stories generally use predictable, tired words.</p> <p>Gerry Bennet, a consultant geriatrician at the London Hospital, has done a lot of work on the abuse of the elderly. He agrees that because we see elderly people as 'terminal', we think of Shipman's crimes as 'terrible, of course, but not as terrible as we should. Look at donations to charities,' he says wryly. 'The appeals that work are for children or animals. Old people aren't sexy.When we think about old age, we feel fear and we don't want to face our own future.' Yet, he says, if we think of the last millennium, you could say that one of the greatest achievements is ageing. At the same time, people transform this achievement into a negative: a 'rising tide of old people that floods the NHS' - the NHS, he points out, that they have paid into all their lives and which now deserts them, refusing them operations and help because of their years. Abuse of the elderly, he says, is always about power. To take a life is the ultimate act of power.</p> <p>We deny older people crucial human qualities. They are not supposed to be sexual, eager, ambitious, angry, jealous, any of the things that we all are. Regan said to Lear: 'O sir! you are old;/ Nature in you stand on the very verge/ Of her confine: you should be rul'd and led/ By some discretion that discerns your state/ Better than yourself...' Old age is seen as relinquishment and abstinence. A time of memory, not of anticipation, past not future, nostalgia not change. We think of old people - doting on their grandchildren, retelling their mythologised past - as living on in the after-image of their own past. No kissing in the park, holding hands in the dark. Yet what old people want is usually what they have always wanted: career, family, friends, sex, appetite, a future. They feel close to the selves they were as children, or young. They look in the mirror and find it hard to believe they have come this far. They still, always, want to be wanted, needed, loved.</p> <p>Tracey Kidder, in Old Friends , his remarkable book about living for a year in an old people's home in America, shows us that the old are only like children in one respect - we treat them like children, talking loudly and slowly, with that over-solicitous tone; not seeing them, never allowing 'us' to become one of 'them'. Our shameful separation from ourselves. And Betty Friedan, who made herself famous with The Feminine Mystique , says in her book about growing older, The Fountain of Age , that 'there's a mystique of age more pernicious, pervasive, than the feminine mystique_ a definition of age only in terms of a decline from youth and not as it is, a period of human life that people didn't even use to have.' We are scared of old age because we are scared of our own frailty and death. Old people are often not visited by family when they are in hospitals or homes, because the family don't want to have to confront in slow-motion their own mortality.</p> <p>Serial killers are a mixture of order and disorder. They operate with a methodical derangement. They are not geniuses, but they are obsessed. Murder is their most passionate hobby. They are hard to catch because they operate outside the realms of reason. In the aftermath of such horror, we look for explanations, like a lesion in the brain or a childhood sexual trauma. We want to know why and how, to learn lessons from the past to protect us in our future. And we seek ways of making sure this never happens again. But one of the unsatisfying lessons of such horrors is that there is no ultimate lesson after all - nothing in the end that provides the final impregnable why, no thick line drawn underneath the horror. Professor Christopher Cordess, co-editor of Forensic Psychiatry: Crime, Psychodynamics and the Offender Patient , says that 'there are some cases that even the further reaches of psychological understanding don't reach. We are left aghast.' It happens. Out of a blue sky, on an ordinary day, to a person who is just getting on with their life, violence falls.</p> <p>Their faces look at us now from the newspapers and the television screen, these women the doctor selected. Marie West, Irene Turner. Lizzie Adams. Jean Lilley. Ivy Lomas. Muriel Grimshaw. Marie Quinn. Bianka Pomfret. Norah Nuttall. Pamela Hillier. Maureen Ward. Winifred Mellor. Joan Melia. Kathleen Grundy. How many more? Such different faces, one thing in common. Most of the women are smiling, as one usually does for the camera. A few are laughing, and their eyes are bright. One is shown on a home movie, dancing round the room in the arms of her partner, neat ankles in dashing high-heeled shoes. One is pictured as a young girl and she looks so carefree, with her life in front of her. They all had their lives in front of them.</p>",

Harold Fred Shipman has been found guilty of killing 15 women, many of them elderly. Police are, at the most recent count, inquiring into 131 more deaths. He is suspected of killing at least 150 of his patients, and one estimate by a coroner even put the number at 1,500. There has never been a case like it: the unprecedented scale; the apparently motiveless slaughter. If the house of Fred and Rosemary West was like an abattoir and a torture chamber, unimaginable horrors taking place in its damp and dark basement, the surgery of Harold Shipman in Hyde was the well-lit, brightly painted centre of operations, where deaths were processed, certificates falsified, computer records backdated. Murder was tracked through audit trails and medical cards and toxicology; the quantity of diamorphine in the blood of the corpses that were disinterred, the long names of unfamiliar drugs. The women were all killed in the same methodical, doctorly way. There would have been no struggle, no terrifying gap in which they would have realised what was being done to them, no violence except for the ultimate violence of murder. Harold Shipman is a smallish, thinnish man with a respectable paunch. He has a pale grey beard and dark grey, thinning hair and wears grey-brown suits, conservative ties, thick-lensed spectacles. With his dry and narrow face, his scratchy, pedantic voice, his tetchy manner, he is like an old-fashioned schoolteacher or a middle-ranking civil servant. During the 57-day trial, he thrummed his fingers on the table, wrote neatly, incessantly, in his notebook, frowned irritably or sarcastically when someone got the medical terminology wrong, became petulant when he was caught out. He seemed as respectable and English as a rainy Sunday afternoon. His patients knew him as a diligent and courteous man, a polite man, a perfect gentleman, the embodiment of a good doctor. He was the secretary of the local Medical Council, the chair of the school's Parent Teacher Association, a member of the Canal Society. He likes figures, he likes lists, he likes organisations, he likes order - he's brilliant at Trivial Pursuits. He has a passion for objects, things; people become items in his murderous catalogue ('this lady's gone', he said of one victim, flicking her eyelid). According to the forensic psychologists who examined him, he needs control. He is addicted to death. The murders he committed were quiet, methodical, secret murders - as the judge described in his anguished summing-up, the women that he killed probably held out their arms and thanked him as he slid the needle into their veins: the prick of death. Like the nurse Beverly Allitt's child-victims, they would never have known they were being murdered. They all trusted their doctor; the sick man who came to heal their sickness. He was a wolf in shepherd's clothing. We stare at the surface, trying to see the horror beneath; the terrifying heart. Harold Shipman was born in Nottingham in 1946 and grew up in a council house. His father was a lorry driver. With his mother Vera's encouragement, he won a place at the grammar school where he worked hard, played rugby, never had a girlfriend. He was his mother's favourite, but when he was 17 Vera Shipman died of cancer. During her last months of agony, he would watch as she sat in her chair while the doctor injected her with pain-relieving morphine. Later, of course, he became the doctor, injecting morphine into the veins of other elderly women as they sat fully dressed in their chairs. In this terrible tableau that he re-enacted so many times, growing more blatant as he went, was he murdering the patients because they weren't his mother? Was he killing her over and over again, or bringing his dear mother back to life again by mimicking that vividly particular moment of his past? It seems too neat and too artistic to be true - a spooky Hitchcockian version of the birth of a murderer, the mummy's boy becoming psycho. For the pains and disappointments and traumas that Harold Shipman experienced are just the stuff of life. Nobody escapes them. They are retrospective explanations that can never really tell us how it was that one unremarkable boy from Nottingham became Western Europe's most prolific murderer, working as hard at his lethal hobby as he had worked at his medical studies. Serial killings often do appear like garish fictions, and the killers like trashy artists bent on recreating the same scene, over and over again. They have their own grotesque 'signatures', they often arrange the bodies to dramatise their own dark fantasies (they remove limbs, cut off breasts, disfigure faces). The American psychologist and detective Robert Keppel says that serial killers usually 'have a compulsion to leave their own personal stamp. The killer's personal stamp takes the form of his unique signature, an imprint left by him at the scene'. They may, he says, carve on the body, bludgeon it, leave messages written in blood, rearrange the position of the victim, performing post-mortem activities which suit their own personal desires. The Wests buried their young female victims upright, in blasphemously vertical coffins; they took away knee and foot bones. Dr Shipman - seating the women, fully dressed, on a chair, and injecting them with morphine - turns the women into his dying mother. Or perhaps he turns them into his wife, the woman he met soon after Vera died, and who looked matronly and middle-aged even as a teenager. And he turns the dead women into lists, catalogues, items on medical cards that are filed away. The 'trophies' he is suspected of taking away from some of the murder scenes are not bits of the body, as with many serial killers, but objects like rings, bracelets, money. The day that his mother died, Harold Shipman ran all night, pounding the road in the driving rain. Then he seemed to get on with his life - working hard, getting into Leeds University, becoming a doctor. He met Primrose Mary Oxtoby at a bus stop, when he was a 20-year-old medical student and she was a 16-year-old window dresser. She had never had a boyfriend before. She soon fell pregnant, to the dismay of her Methodist family, and when she was 17 the pair married, three months before the birth of their daughter Sarah. At the moment of his apparently triumphant upward mobility, the young medic married the barely literate woman from the world he seemed to have escaped. Shipman's life reads like a mixture of Thomas Hardy and Thomas Harris. It seems that Primrose lost her family and her previous existence when she married: she moved into his narrow world, became the doctor's wife, bringing up his children, sometimes helping out in the surgery. They had three more children (Christopher, David and Samuel). Harold finished his training. In 1971 he qualified as a doctor. In 1974 he became a GP in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. It was here he suffered a glitch in his career, for it was discovered he had been forging prescriptions for the pain-killing drug pethidine, to which he had become addicted. He admitted everything, checked into hospital, and pleaded guilty to forging prescriptions and stealing drugs. In 1977, 'rehabilitated', the couple moved with their growing family to the outskirts of Manchester. Here he became the 'good doctor' of Hyde, adored by his patients who flooded his surgery with letters of support after he was arrested. Even today, in an age when we distrust experts and question authority, doctors are like magicians, with their mysterious kit of tools and potions, their secret vocabulary, their impenetrable handwriting, their hidden knowledge. They can cure and listen. They know our pains and indignities, intimate details about our bodies and our lives. We believe in the doctor, and often become helpless before them. This relationship of subservience and authority gives the doctor great power. Dr Richard Nicholson of The Bulletin of Medical Ethics , asks us to consider how 'nice, intelligent schoolchildren, who go into medicine for humanitarian reasons, are 10 years later working in a system where for the most part questions are not encouraged. Where it is too easy to become arrogant and to stop thinking of patients as human beings, but as symptoms and problems; not human beings like us, but biological processes, objects.' It became a horrible thought through the trial that maybe this small, neat, pedantic man had killed 15 women (and how many more?) because they got on his nerves; needed tidying away. As if they were not people in his mind but symptoms and problems: a cold, a cancer, a heartburn, an ache, an irritation and a worry. Can evil be as terrifyingly banal as all that? Primrose is much larger than her husband; if they stood together, which now they never will, she would dwarf him. During the trial, she mostly dressed in sludge-coloured clothes. She has a pudding-bowl of greying hair and a doughy, grey face. Every day, she took her seat at the front of the public gallery and stared. Even when he collapsed into the dock to cry, coming up minutes later with a reddened nose and a pallid face, she stared and didn't look down and didn't flinch. I didn't see love or hate or pity or horror on her unreadable face. No amazement or anger. She was a loyal wife, a large and lonely figure, a closed book. Who can imagine what her life will be now - or the life of the four children, who woke up one day to find their respectable father was a serial killer? How do you remake your life after that, when his blood runs in your veins? What is your inheritance? Photographs of Primrose when young show that she never looked like a spring flower. She always looked unglamorous and safely unsexual. While the Wests and Myra Hindley lived in a perversely sexualised world, the Shipmans seemed to those that knew them to live in the opposite: a calmly de-sexed one. He was the overworked doctor (she even sometimes called him 'doctor' rather than 'Fred', his usual name to friends), she the overweight wife, dousing any hints of sexuality or youth in too much flesh and shapeless clothes. He would leave the bleak-ish semi-detached house early for the work he loved, coming back in the evening to collapse in front of the TV while she made dinner. They rarely went out together. It appears to outsiders to have been a life where the flame had been turned down low. Even those few minutes surrounding the murders were ones of secret negative pleasures or relief from extreme tension. Not for Harold Shipman the prolonged sexual frenzy of most serial killers, the grotesque drawn-out euphoria. With the Wests, or Myra Hindley and Ian Brady, or Peter Sutcliffe, the extreme sadism was like a Hieronymous Bosch canvas on which the darkest horrors of a mind were daubed. In the Shipman case there was no convulsive surface. For a long time, the murders were never even perceived as such: unnatural was thought to be natural. In a way that unsettles and induces guilt, we can understand extreme sexual perversion better than we can understand this quiet, polite, secret slaughter. One of the most shocking things about the long trial was how Shipman did not become a figure of horror, the stuff of our nightmares. We think serial killers should look different from us. We want them to look inhuman because we want to think of them as inhuman - removed from us, bestial or evil. 'They were not beasts but men, and what they did was a product of specific human ingenuity,' writes Robert Jay Lifton in his book about Nazi doctors. 'They were not demonic figures,' says an Auschwitz survivor of the Nazi doctors. 'What was demonic was that they were not demonic.' Thomas Harris's hero-monster, Hannibal Lecter, has six fingers and purple eyes and the uncanny grace of a panther. Myra Hindley was abhorred not just for what she did, but because of that photograph of her, with the blond wig and heavy make-up, transforming her into an icon of sexualised and perverse female evil. Her partner in crime, Ian Brady, remained a vague, shadowy figure. Other children are killed by children, but it was James Bulger who tugged at all our heartstrings because he was caught on a grainy security video in the shopping centre, his small hand trustingly in the older child's hand - a lamb to the slaughter; we saw the image going round and round on a loop, so that it felt as if it was still going on. Peter Sutcliffe had a chalk-white face and a black beard and ghastly voices roaring in his head. Threadbare, grey Dr Shipman looks like an identikit picture of ordinariness and respectability - an image that is an anti-image. Beyond this, Shipman was less horrifying to us because of who he killed. All of the victims were women, many of them elderly. In newspapers, they were frequently all called old, thus shamefully bundled together and tidied away with that one epithet, even though one, Bianka Pomfrett, was just 49, which is hardly even middle-aged, and her face that now gazes from the rows of photographs in newspaper pages looks young and thoughtful. We expect old people to die. We think of them as if they are in death's waiting room. When the young die, it is their future as well as their present that we mourn. The old are supposed to be ready for death, relinquishing turbulent, fretful life for peaceful, easeful oblivion. Shipman's victims were unnoticed victims for a disquieting stretch of time; murders that we didn't call murders. Even once the trial began, there was sparse coverage in most newspapers. People's reactions often seemed to be not ones of pity or fear, but of distaste. In Hyde last week, just before the verdict was reached, many of Harold Shipman's patients were even saying that they would return to him if they could. 'I'd go back tomorrow,' says one woman, scowling at me ferociously in the market place. 'I don't know about those murders, to me he was always a good doctor.' 'A perfect gentleman,' says another. 'And anyway, only God can know why he did it.' 'The best doctor, always there. Couldn't put a foot wrong.' These people aren't saying he didn't do it. They are close to saying that it doesn't really matter. Shipman is on suicide watch in prison, but warders apparently say he will not be at great risk from other prisoners. He hasn't killed children. He has only killed elderly women. There has never been a time, in the Western world, when we have denied age and death as we do today. We want to live longer and longer, forever. Once we valued age and wisdom; now we value youth, newness, and we dread old age, the lines on the face, life marking us: not just closer to death but further away from what we think of as life. Instead of thinking of the elderly as full of years, it is as if the more years we have, the emptier of life we become - we are using it up, running out of life and out of time. Ronald Blythe, in his wonderful book about old age, The View in Winter , points out that it used to be the exception to go grey, to live through the menopause, to retire, to become senile. There was a sense of the precariousness and preciousness of life, which could end at any time. To live to old age was extraordinary. Now old age is expected, ordinary - and thus contemptible. One in 10 people are over 60; by 2050, one in five will be over 60. And there are many more old women than old men. Simone de Beauvoir, in her sombre The Coming of Age , writes that when old people speak of the elderly they never use the word 'we', always 'they'. She writes about how we avoid the old; it is society's 'secret shame'. Today, in the year 2000, it seems as if we think of the old in the same, brutal way that we used to think of the poor in the nineteenth century: as an intractable problem, a burden. What shall we do with the hordes of people who have left the blessed land of youth? Age Concern has produced surveys on the media's attitudes towards the old. In a report on older people on tele vision ('Fading Out of the Picture'), they revealed that older people appear on television three times less, proportionally, than you would expect them to given their real life numbers. Older women are particularly neglected (70 per cent men to 30 per cent women). What is more, the characters they represent in dramas are often stereotyped (they moan, forget, dwell on the past, are doting and sweet and dotty_). The picture is slightly better in newspapers, where news stories about older people are not neglected. However, the concept of what stories are worth telling has not been updated: older people are mostly depicted as victims, frail objects of pity. The headlines above the stories generally use predictable, tired words. Gerry Bennet, a consultant geriatrician at the London Hospital, has done a lot of work on the abuse of the elderly. He agrees that because we see elderly people as 'terminal', we think of Shipman's crimes as 'terrible, of course, but not as terrible as we should. Look at donations to charities,' he says wryly. 'The appeals that work are for children or animals. Old people aren't sexy.When we think about old age, we feel fear and we don't want to face our own future.' Yet, he says, if we think of the last millennium, you could say that one of the greatest achievements is ageing. At the same time, people transform this achievement into a negative: a 'rising tide of old people that floods the NHS' - the NHS, he points out, that they have paid into all their lives and which now deserts them, refusing them operations and help because of their years. Abuse of the elderly, he says, is always about power. To take a life is the ultimate act of power. We deny older people crucial human qualities. They are not supposed to be sexual, eager, ambitious, angry, jealous, any of the things that we all are. Regan said to Lear: 'O sir! you are old;/ Nature in you stand on the very verge/ Of her confine: you should be rul'd and led/ By some discretion that discerns your state/ Better than yourself...' Old age is seen as relinquishment and abstinence. A time of memory, not of anticipation, past not future, nostalgia not change. We think of old people - doting on their grandchildren, retelling their mythologised past - as living on in the after-image of their own past. No kissing in the park, holding hands in the dark. Yet what old people want is usually what they have always wanted: career, family, friends, sex, appetite, a future. They feel close to the selves they were as children, or young. They look in the mirror and find it hard to believe they have come this far. They still, always, want to be wanted, needed, loved. Tracey Kidder, in Old Friends , his remarkable book about living for a year in an old people's home in America, shows us that the old are only like children in one respect - we treat them like children, talking loudly and slowly, with that over-solicitous tone; not seeing them, never allowing 'us' to become one of 'them'. Our shameful separation from ourselves. And Betty Friedan, who made herself famous with The Feminine Mystique , says in her book about growing older, The Fountain of Age , that 'there's a mystique of age more pernicious, pervasive, than the feminine mystique_ a definition of age only in terms of a decline from youth and not as it is, a period of human life that people didn't even use to have.' We are scared of old age because we are scared of our own frailty and death. Old people are often not visited by family when they are in hospitals or homes, because the family don't want to have to confront in slow-motion their own mortality. Serial killers are a mixture of order and disorder. They operate with a methodical derangement. They are not geniuses, but they are obsessed. Murder is their most passionate hobby. They are hard to catch because they operate outside the realms of reason. In the aftermath of such horror, we look for explanations, like a lesion in the brain or a childhood sexual trauma. We want to know why and how, to learn lessons from the past to protect us in our future. And we seek ways of making sure this never happens again. But one of the unsatisfying lessons of such horrors is that there is no ultimate lesson after all - nothing in the end that provides the final impregnable why, no thick line drawn underneath the horror. Professor Christopher Cordess, co-editor of Forensic Psychiatry: Crime, Psychodynamics and the Offender Patient , says that 'there are some cases that even the further reaches of psychological understanding don't reach. We are left aghast.' It happens. Out of a blue sky, on an ordinary day, to a person who is just getting on with their life, violence falls. Their faces look at us now from the newspapers and the television screen, these women the doctor selected. Marie West, Irene Turner. Lizzie Adams. Jean Lilley. Ivy Lomas. Muriel Grimshaw. Marie Quinn. Bianka Pomfret. Norah Nuttall. Pamela Hillier. Maureen Ward. Winifred Mellor. Joan Melia. Kathleen Grundy. How many more? Such different faces, one thing in common. Most of the women are smiling, as one usually does for the camera. A few are laughing, and their eyes are bright. One is shown on a home movie, dancing round the room in the arms of her partner, neat ankles in dashing high-heeled shoes. One is pictured as a young girl and she looks so carefree, with her life in front of her. They all had their lives in front of them.",

But if anything is brought to our attention with regard to an individual we would naturally bring it to the attention of the GPs,' said Common.</p> <p>He added that someone who had been sacked for gross misconduct would be unlikely to secure job within his authority.</p> <p>From 1994 to March 1999, Gilmore was responsible for the GPs' drug budgets, becoming a close personal friend of the Shipmans, staying at the family home at times, even after the arrest.</p> <p>He will now be questioned by the local medical committee where he works as a part-time administrator. The Hyde LMC secretary, Dr Kalash Chand, said: 'We were not aware Mr Gilmore had been sacked for gross misconduct and are very concerned. His explanation of why he left that job seems to have been economical with the truth. We will be having a meeting with him on Monday.'</p> <p>Doctors at Shipman's practice were first alerted to his crimes by the unusually high number of cremations among patients he was trating.</p> <p>'At the start of 1998, Shipman was coming in to our surgery and asking us to countersign more cremation certificates than ever before,' says Dr Raj Patel, one of the doctors responsible for sparking the first police investigation.</p> <p>'We worked out that his rate of death for elderly patients was three times our own. We reported this to the coroner and the police and almost immediately the deaths stopped.</p> <p>'We are certain that he found out he was being looked into and changed his behaviour accordingly.'</p> <p>Shipman had killed more than 20 patients in the first three months of the year before the investigation had begun. Only during the trial was it revealed that Shipman altered notes on previous victims in early 1998, to fit cause of death. Dr Alan Banks from the West Pennine Health Authority was asked by poice to examine the files of 14 of Shipman's patients. His comment was that they were not as detailed as they should have been.</p> <p>In the next four months, he would kill just three more. Sources close to the investi gation believe that the final three deaths may have been an attempt by Shipman to 'keep up appearances' rather than rouse suspicion by ending his killing spree completely.</p> <p>Greater Manchester Police, who are examining the deaths of 171 of Shipman's patients, are believed to be pursuing several other lines of inquiry including a hunt for the person responsible for the tip off. If it is found that Shipman was deliberately alerted about the investigation, the mole would face a charge of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.</p> <p>Shipman was phenomenally well connected in the Hyde community and the source of the leak could have come from many avenues.</p> <p>Although the cost of Shipman's murder trial was met by the legal aid board, the bill for the year-long run up was met entirely by the Medical Defence Union. Last year the union spent \u00a365 million defending and settling claims against doctors.

      "bodyText": "Health officials are set to question the former practice manager of Dr Harold Shipman - jailed for life last week for killing 15 elderly patients - over allegations that he lied about his background in order to get his job. John Gilmore, 47, had been dismissed from a previous NHS position for gross misconduct. Gilmore was employed jointly by Shipman and four other doctors from single-handed surgeries in the Hyde area to manage their funds. He was interviewed in the presence of a West Pennine Health Authority official. The authority's chief executive, David Common, said Gilmore did not reveal his past misdemeamours which had only come to his attention last week. 'The consortium of GPs was in fact employing Mr Gilmore independently of the authority. But if anything is brought to our attention with regard to an individual we would naturally bring it to the attention of the GPs,' said Common. He added that someone who had been sacked for gross misconduct would be unlikely to secure job within his authority. From 1994 to March 1999, Gilmore was responsible for the GPs' drug budgets, becoming a close personal friend of the Shipmans, staying at the family home at times, even after the arrest. He will now be questioned by the local medical committee where he works as a part-time administrator. The Hyde LMC secretary, Dr Kalash Chand, said: 'We were not aware Mr Gilmore had been sacked for gross misconduct and are very concerned. His explanation of why he left that job seems to have been economical with the truth. We will be having a meeting with him on Monday.' Doctors at Shipman's practice were first alerted to his crimes by the unusually high number of cremations among patients he was trating. 'At the start of 1998, Shipman was coming in to our surgery and asking us to countersign more cremation certificates than ever before,' says Dr Raj Patel, one of the doctors responsible for sparking the first police investigation. 'We worked out that his rate of death for elderly patients was three times our own. We reported this to the coroner and the police and almost immediately the deaths stopped. 'We are certain that he found out he was being looked into and changed his behaviour accordingly.' Shipman had killed more than 20 patients in the first three months of the year before the investigation had begun. Only during the trial was it revealed that Shipman altered notes on previous victims in early 1998, to fit cause of death. Dr Alan Banks from the West Pennine Health Authority was asked by poice to examine the files of 14 of Shipman's patients. His comment was that they were not as detailed as they should have been. In the next four months, he would kill just three more. Sources close to the investi gation believe that the final three deaths may have been an attempt by Shipman to 'keep up appearances' rather than rouse suspicion by ending his killing spree completely. Greater Manchester Police, who are examining the deaths of 171 of Shipman's patients, are believed to be pursuing several other lines of inquiry including a hunt for the person responsible for the tip off. If it is found that Shipman was deliberately alerted about the investigation, the mole would face a charge of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Shipman was phenomenally well connected in the Hyde community and the source of the leak could have come from many avenues. Although the cost of Shipman's murder trial was met by the legal aid board, the bill for the year-long run up was met entirely by the Medical Defence Union. Last year the union spent \u00a365 million defending and settling claims against doctors. It supports the cases of 9 out of 10 doctors accused of wrongdoing. The union was first alerted in February 1998 by Dr Patel, his colleague, Dr Linda Reynolds, and the local undertaker, Deborah Bambroffe, who had noticed that a large number of Shipman's patients did not appear to have been ill when they died. The union urged extreme caution but the trio decided to inform the local coroner of their suspicions. He in turn called the police. Both Reynolds and the coroner stressed that the inquiry should be kept 'confidential and discreet'. The chief executive of the Lincolnshire Heath Authority, Richard Jevins, told The Observer : 'I understand we have never been approached by a new employer of Mr Gilmore's for references. Certainly I would have expected any health authority recruiting anyone to seek references.' Three years after his sacking Gilmore charged the LHA with unfair dismissal and his claim was settled out of court. tracy.mcveigh@observer.co.uk tony.thompson@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Britain is set to double spending on transport within 10 years, cherry-picking the best schemes from Europe to provide the most effective travel network in the EU . </p> <p>Plans are being drawn up on the basis that transport spending over the next 10 years will total \u00a3160 billion - twice as much as previously expected - according to several ministerial sources. </p> <p>Public funding will double from \u00a350bn to around \u00a3100bn and the rest is expected to come from the private sector through public-private partnerships to modernise and expand public transport and investment in new trains, planes and buses. </p> <p>The Government has asked its transport advisers to come up with a 'shopping list' of road and public transport schemes by the end of April to help Britain accelerate away from the chronic congestion and crumbling systems that put it among the worst in Europe. </p> <p>They will scour the European Union for 'best practice' in tram systems, road use, cycling, bus and rail travel as well as planning, fiscal and safety policies. </p> <p>Professor David Begg, chairman of the Commission For Integrated Transport (CFIT), which advises the Government on policy, said it was not yet known how much extra funding would be earmarked for transport, but the Government had indicated it was prepared to spend more. </p> <p>But he warned it would take a huge increase in spending to bring the network up to scratch - and measures to curb congestion would be needed alongside improvements in public transport. </p> <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that Chancellor Gordon Brown has a surplus of up to \u00a37bn to distribute in tax cuts and increased public spending in his Budget next month, although it is acknowledged that health and education currently have a higher profile. But there is scope to award extra funds for local transport plans, rail projects and the roads programme. </p> <p>Last week Begg firmly endorsed the policies to ease traffic jams by introducing congestion charging and a levy on workplace car-parks. Local authorities are expected to invest up front, with a combination of public funding, soft loans from Government and secured funding to improve public transport in advance of collecting revenue from motorists (congestion charging) or employers (workplace parking levy). </p> <p>Begg said: 'Most people assume that better public transport is the answer to congestion, but Paris has superb public transport and terrible congestion. It has to be part of a package of measures, but without congestion charging and planning measures; just improving public transport is not going to work.' </p> <p>Begg said that there was not a single EU state that came out best on all aspects of transport and could be used as a model. </p> <p>None of the EU members has an effective policy for reducing traffic congestion. The best example that CFIT has come across is much further afield - in Singapore, where they have draconian congestion charging to limit traffic in the island state. </p> <p>CFIT will examine different systems and policies across the EU. Ministers want to know why Germans own more than 500 cars per 1,000 inhabitants but use them a lot less than Britons, who own 400 cars per 1,000 people but rely on them more than anyone else in Europe, with 88 per cent of journeys in the UK undertaken by car. </p> <p>Britain spends less than 1 per cent of its gross domestic product on transport, less than Germany, France, Finland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, according to the Organisation for Eco nomic Cooperation and Development. </p> <p>Britain's roads are five times more congested than Germany's, twice as congested as Italy's and 3.5 times more choked up than France's. </p> <p>Begg endorsed the view of transport minister Lord Macdonald that the Government accepted that car ownership would rise in a growing economy and that ownership was an issue of 'social inclusion'. </p> <p>But while Macdonald has sought to encourage more affordable car use at the same time as softening the Government's line on reducing traffic levels, Begg insisted that there should be local programmes to reduce congestion, pollution and overall car use. </p> <p>'Car ownership is acceptable but we need to shift the burden from ownership to car use. If we are going to achieve less car use within growing car ownership, we need fiscal measures to reduce the fixed cost of motoring and increase the variable cost of journeys,' he said. </p> <p>This means congestion charging and duty on petrol, offset by a new system of lower vehicle excise duty - the annual 'road tax'. </p> <p>Begg wants the Government to tighten up on planning policy and reverse the trend towards out-of-town shopping that is accelerating the decline of many town centres and villages. </p> <p>CFIT has put off until next year a policy decision on whether parking spaces at out-of-town retail and leisure complexes should be taxed. But the priority is to help the Government flesh out its 10-year vision for transport with a plan that, according to Begg, involves the kind of money and ambition 'that has not been seen in Britain since the Victorian era'.</p>",

Plans are being drawn up on the basis that transport spending over the next 10 years will total \u00a3160 billion - twice as much as previously expected - according to several ministerial sources. Public funding will double from \u00a350bn to around \u00a3100bn and the rest is expected to come from the private sector through public-private partnerships to modernise and expand public transport and investment in new trains, planes and buses. The Government has asked its transport advisers to come up with a 'shopping list' of road and public transport schemes by the end of April to help Britain accelerate away from the chronic congestion and crumbling systems that put it among the worst in Europe. They will scour the European Union for 'best practice' in tram systems, road use, cycling, bus and rail travel as well as planning, fiscal and safety policies. Professor David Begg, chairman of the Commission For Integrated Transport (CFIT), which advises the Government on policy, said it was not yet known how much extra funding would be earmarked for transport, but the Government had indicated it was prepared to spend more. But he warned it would take a huge increase in spending to bring the network up to scratch - and measures to curb congestion would be needed alongside improvements in public transport. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that Chancellor Gordon Brown has a surplus of up to \u00a37bn to distribute in tax cuts and increased public spending in his Budget next month, although it is acknowledged that health and education currently have a higher profile. But there is scope to award extra funds for local transport plans, rail projects and the roads programme. Last week Begg firmly endorsed the policies to ease traffic jams by introducing congestion charging and a levy on workplace car-parks. Local authorities are expected to invest up front, with a combination of public funding, soft loans from Government and secured funding to improve public transport in advance of collecting revenue from motorists (congestion charging) or employers (workplace parking levy). Begg said: 'Most people assume that better public transport is the answer to congestion, but Paris has superb public transport and terrible congestion. It has to be part of a package of measures, but without congestion charging and planning measures; just improving public transport is not going to work.' Begg said that there was not a single EU state that came out best on all aspects of transport and could be used as a model. None of the EU members has an effective policy for reducing traffic congestion. The best example that CFIT has come across is much further afield - in Singapore, where they have draconian congestion charging to limit traffic in the island state. CFIT will examine different systems and policies across the EU. Ministers want to know why Germans own more than 500 cars per 1,000 inhabitants but use them a lot less than Britons, who own 400 cars per 1,000 people but rely on them more than anyone else in Europe, with 88 per cent of journeys in the UK undertaken by car. Britain spends less than 1 per cent of its gross domestic product on transport, less than Germany, France, Finland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, according to the Organisation for Eco nomic Cooperation and Development. Britain's roads are five times more congested than Germany's, twice as congested as Italy's and 3.5 times more choked up than France's. Begg endorsed the view of transport minister Lord Macdonald that the Government accepted that car ownership would rise in a growing economy and that ownership was an issue of 'social inclusion'. But while Macdonald has sought to encourage more affordable car use at the same time as softening the Government's line on reducing traffic levels, Begg insisted that there should be local programmes to reduce congestion, pollution and overall car use. 'Car ownership is acceptable but we need to shift the burden from ownership to car use. If we are going to achieve less car use within growing car ownership, we need fiscal measures to reduce the fixed cost of motoring and increase the variable cost of journeys,' he said. This means congestion charging and duty on petrol, offset by a new system of lower vehicle excise duty - the annual 'road tax'. Begg wants the Government to tighten up on planning policy and reverse the trend towards out-of-town shopping that is accelerating the decline of many town centres and villages. CFIT has put off until next year a policy decision on whether parking spaces at out-of-town retail and leisure complexes should be taxed. But the priority is to help the Government flesh out its 10-year vision for transport with a plan that, according to Begg, involves the kind of money and ambition 'that has not been seen in Britain since the Victorian era'.",

So great is the demand for comment and 'insider' analysis that wild hunches, tripe really, is packaged as fact, trimmed with self-importance and flung into the insatiable mouth of the news beast. So let us be honest about Northern Ireland: there is one conversation that matters and nobody who writes in any newspaper you will read, or speaks in any broadcast you will hear, has a clue about it.</p> <p>Are the IRA commanders in Armagh and South Tyrone sitting in silence watching the same TV reports as the rest of us? Do they even speak, at any length? Or are they, even now, yelling across kitchen tables, smashing phone receivers down, testing every last syllable of the Sinn Fein message? Reader, I don't know. And nor, until perhaps many years hence, when one of them writes a trustworthy memoir, will you.</p> <p>The frantic to-ing and fro-ing between London and Dublin, the meetings of civil servants and politicians, the statements of Peter Mandelson and David Trimble - all this is as nothing compared to the Provos' internal debate. Everything rests on them. Three hundred terrorist prisoners have been released. The RUC is being dismantled and recast. The Irish constitution has been amended. Unionists have sat down in government with Republicans.</p> <p>The complexity of the job already done by successive politicians and diplomats in their search for peace can hardly be described. It must have been like building a fantastically complicated, three-dimensional jigsaw, with greasy, unreliable pieces, in the dark, during a hailstorm. Anyone who thinks that there is no honour left in public life, or that civil servants are mostly useless, should stop and think of the peace process. Which now, teetering and swaying in the wind, is on the point of collapse because the IRA will not keep its promise about decommissioning. Sinn Fein's Mitchell McLaughlin, who is, despite his hard line on television, a decent and intelligent man emotionally committed to peace, has made much of the fact that the real deadline, the one in the agreement, is still many weeks away. But given that he can hold out little hope of the IRA decommissioning by then either, it seems almost irrelevant.</p> <p>There is an argument, held by respectable and thoughtful people, that we should forget decommissioning. It is a symbolic act only, they say. Of course, some arms will always be held by some people. The war could be re-started at any time, whatever stockpiles were or were not around the place. So don't rub Republican noses in this. Peace is peace. Silent, hidden guns kill no more people than decommissioned ones. Let sleeping terrorists lie.</p> <p>What this seductive argument omits, of course, is the agony and division in Unionist politics. In London and even Dublin, people don't really want to know about Northern Ireland. They think that so long as no-one is being killed, no pubs blown up or army checkpoints machine-gunned, then everything has stopped. That 'it is over'. But it isn't over. Both Gerry Adams and David Trimble know that. Adams and his colleagues believe that taking the gun out of Irish politics is a stage in a process which will lead to the reunification of the island.</p> <p>Or, to put it shortly, the Unionists are stuffed. The greater wealth south of the border; the growth in the province's Catholic population; the loosening of the British Union from Scotland and Wales _ these are all signs of a fundamental political shift in the islands which will end, willy-nilly, with the dismantling of the UK as presently constituted.</p> <p>Therefore, the Republican analysis goes, 'we are going to win in the end'. It may take 10 or even 20 years, but the outcome is certain. In which case, what are the Unionists going to do? Now, the next bit might make some readers choke, but here goes: hardline Republicans are worried about a cycle of uncontrollable violence.

      "bodyText": "You know this already, but let me repeat it. Journalists make a lot of stuff up. So great is the demand for comment and 'insider' analysis that wild hunches, tripe really, is packaged as fact, trimmed with self-importance and flung into the insatiable mouth of the news beast. So let us be honest about Northern Ireland: there is one conversation that matters and nobody who writes in any newspaper you will read, or speaks in any broadcast you will hear, has a clue about it. Are the IRA commanders in Armagh and South Tyrone sitting in silence watching the same TV reports as the rest of us? Do they even speak, at any length? Or are they, even now, yelling across kitchen tables, smashing phone receivers down, testing every last syllable of the Sinn Fein message? Reader, I don't know. And nor, until perhaps many years hence, when one of them writes a trustworthy memoir, will you. The frantic to-ing and fro-ing between London and Dublin, the meetings of civil servants and politicians, the statements of Peter Mandelson and David Trimble - all this is as nothing compared to the Provos' internal debate. Everything rests on them. Three hundred terrorist prisoners have been released. The RUC is being dismantled and recast. The Irish constitution has been amended. Unionists have sat down in government with Republicans. The complexity of the job already done by successive politicians and diplomats in their search for peace can hardly be described. It must have been like building a fantastically complicated, three-dimensional jigsaw, with greasy, unreliable pieces, in the dark, during a hailstorm. Anyone who thinks that there is no honour left in public life, or that civil servants are mostly useless, should stop and think of the peace process. Which now, teetering and swaying in the wind, is on the point of collapse because the IRA will not keep its promise about decommissioning. Sinn Fein's Mitchell McLaughlin, who is, despite his hard line on television, a decent and intelligent man emotionally committed to peace, has made much of the fact that the real deadline, the one in the agreement, is still many weeks away. But given that he can hold out little hope of the IRA decommissioning by then either, it seems almost irrelevant. There is an argument, held by respectable and thoughtful people, that we should forget decommissioning. It is a symbolic act only, they say. Of course, some arms will always be held by some people. The war could be re-started at any time, whatever stockpiles were or were not around the place. So don't rub Republican noses in this. Peace is peace. Silent, hidden guns kill no more people than decommissioned ones. Let sleeping terrorists lie. What this seductive argument omits, of course, is the agony and division in Unionist politics. In London and even Dublin, people don't really want to know about Northern Ireland. They think that so long as no-one is being killed, no pubs blown up or army checkpoints machine-gunned, then everything has stopped. That 'it is over'. But it isn't over. Both Gerry Adams and David Trimble know that. Adams and his colleagues believe that taking the gun out of Irish politics is a stage in a process which will lead to the reunification of the island. Or, to put it shortly, the Unionists are stuffed. The greater wealth south of the border; the growth in the province's Catholic population; the loosening of the British Union from Scotland and Wales _ these are all signs of a fundamental political shift in the islands which will end, willy-nilly, with the dismantling of the UK as presently constituted. Therefore, the Republican analysis goes, 'we are going to win in the end'. It may take 10 or even 20 years, but the outcome is certain. In which case, what are the Unionists going to do? Now, the next bit might make some readers choke, but here goes: hardline Republicans are worried about a cycle of uncontrollable violence. If the Unionists really think they are going to be outvoted eventually, and will be betrayed by London, then they may fight. These are hard, gritty people, the descendants of settlers, with something of the frontier spirit in their blood still. With little to lose, they would go down in fire. Before the ceasefire, Sinn Fein decided, there was a real chance of full-scale civil war in Northern Ireland, violence of a scale far greater than the 'Troubles'. Civil war would be, in many ways, an utterly bizarre outcome. The raw bigotry and discrimination of the old Unionist statelet has passed away. There is more prosperity and less religious fanaticism year by year. Taking Northern Ireland in 2000 AD and turning it into Beirut at its worst would take some doing. But we should not be complacent; and the Sinn Fein analysis needs to be taken seriously. Republicans have been demonised for so long and so effectively in the British press that it is sometimes hard to remember that they are also family people, with hopes for their children. They really fear a new cycle of poverty, unemployment and killing; and they are acting as wise leaders of their community in fearing it. In short, they need David Trimble and they need to make the IRA understand why. For the failure of the IRA to move on decommissioning is a massive political failure also in the strategy of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. They have managed to bring things to a pass where they may lose the only substantial Unionist leader they could do business with; and send Unionism into a spin of uncontrollable anger and despair. Politically, the IRA are behaving idiotically. Why? I don't know. I fear that it's about very basic reactions. The gunmen in the dripping border villages aren't doing well out of this. The flash, vocal townies, McGuinness and Adams - well, they have a fine old time, don't they just? Trips to the White House. Government jobs. Cars. Deferential civil servants. Dandy for them.

So, taking a long view, will the gunmen and their families. But in the here and now, these are the only people who lose.

At the time that he was ejected from parliament by the voters of Enfield Southgate, everyone assumed (and huge numbers were delighted) that it was a disastrous, potentially fatal slither down the greasy pole for Michael Portillo. 'Portillo's on the dole,' chanted a gleeful mob outside Conservative Central Office as they cheered the destruction of the man who encapsulated everything they hated about the toppled Tory regime. People asked each other: 'Were you still up for Portillo?' The question was so symbolic of the relish which greeted the scalping of the Castillian quiff that it was even used as the title of an excellent book about the May Day massacre.</p> <p>There is an alternative world in which the nation was deprived of that unifying surge of joy. Michael Portillo held his seat. In the Tory leadership contest that followed, and with William Hague as his campaign manager, Portillo overwhelmed all rivals to succeed John Major at the head of the Tory rump. Had that happened, I am fairly sure that the Tories would be little more loved - it is quite as likely that they would be even more loathed - than they are today. Were Michael Portillo already the Leader of the Opposition, I and the rest of the commentating class would regularly report on the menacing mutterings among Tory MPs about his failure to make any significant impression on Tony Blair. Widespread would be the speculation about the identity of the successor to Portillo after he had led the Tories to their inevitable defeat at the next election. Hague - heaped with praise by the parliamentary sketchwriters for his witty performances as Shadow Chancellor - would be much tipped as a man to watch as the next leader of the Conservative Party. He is christened the bald-apparent. Hague's regular protestations of undying loyalty to the leader - he calls Portillo 'unassailable' - are believed by no one. How big a chunk will Portillo have to take out of the New Labour majority to protect himself against a post-election leadership challenge by Hague? That is what everyone would very likely be writing.</p> <p>Look at it this way and it's now evident that, far from being an awful blow to his career, Portillo's defenestration from the Commons was the best possible thing that ever happened to him. Not only has he been distanced from the Tories' failings, he has enjoyed the space to rebrand himself. He took a televised train voyage around his Spanish republican father. He swabbed the floors in a hospital and wrote of his admiration for those working in the health service. He groped towards a more compassionate brand of Conservatism. He self-outed himself, a step he would not have voluntarily taken had he become Tory leader after the election. Most of all, he has not been required to prove in hard political combat that he would be more effective or popular as Tory leader than any of the alternatives.</p> <p>So long as Portillo has been absent from the front line, Conservative MPs have sighed to themselves, 'If only'. If only El Caudillo was in charge, we wouldn't be submerged with this subterranean poll rating. If only Portillo was our leader, we wouldn't be such a joke. If only Portillo was the bull at the head of the herd, we might be within a shout of winning the next election.</p> <p>In this respect, the absence of Portillo has been very undermining of William Hague. So it was sensible to accelerate his return to the front bench and, up to a point, shrewd to place him in the exposed position of Shadow Chancellor. Portillo is pitted against the formidable Gordon Brown who has already chewed up and spat out Peter Lilley and Francis Maude. We will now begin to see whether Portillo really does possess the Right Stuff. Alternatively, he will be exposed as a pair of lips, a hairstyle and a dash of aftershave masking an absence of original thought.</p> <p>He made a brisk start by dropping Tory opposition to independence for the Bank of England and ending their hostility to the minimum wage. Both shifts have been signalled for some months. Both were inevitable. It was never going to be clever politics to fight the next election on a promise to put interest rates back in the hands of the same Tory politicians who presided over record home repossessions, and a pledge to cut the wages of two million people. It is a tribute to Portillo's panache - which could be another way of saying shamelessness - that most of the press coverage has described these U-turns as something of a personal triumph.</p> <p>There is more dumping to be done. The Conservatives are also going to have to come to terms with the 48-hour maximum working week - unless they want to fight the next election with Labour posters declaring that the Tories would force millions of people to work longer hours.</p> <p>I expect Portillo, always much more of a pragmatist than his ideological posturing tends to suggest, will be pretty ruthless at ditching voter-repellent bits of Tory baggage. Where he has so far been terribly weak - despite all that spare time he has had to spend thinking - is describing what the Conservatives are positively about. For someone often described as the philosopher-prince of a 'New Toryism', he has been silent about what this might come to in either theory or practice. Are his ideas too alarming to be undressed in public? Or is the problem that he doesn't have anything less banal to say than he's in favour of freedom, choice and lower taxes.</p> <p>Which raises the question whether any of that reinvention was more than skin deep. People talk of the New Portillo. Well, so they do in the Westminster Village and Media Gulch. What I wonder is whether he looks any different out there, beyond Parliament Square, in the real world where votes are cast. It's unarguable that he's a big hitter. In a Tory solar system mainly composed of black holes and brown dwarfs, Michael Portillo has stellar quality. What doesn't necessarily follow, as the man himself would probably privately acknowledge, is that this means the voters like him anymore than they did before. The only opinion poll I've found that bothered to ask the question suggests that the Conservatives would be even less popular led by Portillo. He is the man who was, in one previous incarnation, the Minister for the Poll Tax. He was Chief Secretary to the Treasury during the humiliation of Black Wednesday and when VAT was imposed on fuel. He was the foam-flecked ranter to the lowest prejudices of the Tory party conference. If these are not the things that the voters most recall about Michael Portillo, then you can be certain that Labour will do its best to remind the country why his defeat produced such paroxysms of delight.</p> <p>Elections are a contest between disillusion and fear: 'kick the buggers out' versus 'better the bastards you know'. The roles played by Labour and the Conservatives at the last election, and the four elections before that, will be reversed at the next. The Tories, as the insurgents, must look to ways of attracting fresh support. Labour, as the incumbents, will seek to keep its coalition together by terrifying the voters about the alternative. Does the prospect of Michael Portillo being resurrected as a Cabinet Minister make it easier or harder for Tony Blair to scare the country with the thought of the Tories returning to office? I merely note that, when it was announced that he was back on the Tory front bench, what I did not see was a crowd outside Central Office joyfully chanting: 'Portillo's off the dole.'</p>",

Meanwhile, the death toll from four days of ethnically motivated violence rose to 10 with the deaths of two ethnic Albanians wounded days earlier. Violence has swept this city since a rocket attack on a UN bus killed two elderly Serbs south of the city. Nato-led peacekeepers were struggling to restore order in Kosovo's most multi-ethnic and troubled city. A German unit was sent to help the French if the crowd tries again to cross the bridge. In the latest attack, at least six French soldiers and one ethnic Albanian were injured. The Albanian man was seen stumbling from the bridge drenched in blood. In apparent retaliation, two ethnic Albanian men were shot to death onThursday in the Serb-controlled section of Kosvska Mitrovica. Soon afterwards grenades at two Serb caf\u00e9s injured 25. Others died in a series of clashes and shootings which swept the city. About 9,000 Serbs control the north bank, and 90,000 ethnic Albanians live on the south side of the town, 30 miles north of the province's capital, Pristina. On Friday, French troops fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of Albanians who pelted them with stones and bottles on the Ibar Bridge. Up to five French soldiers were injured, including one who suffered a broken arm, troops said. Elsewhere in Kosovo, violence was also on the rise.",

      "body": "<p>As John McCain barnstorms his way south, fresh from victory in last Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, the interesting - and difficult - phase in his remarkable shakedown of American politics begins. From now on this is no media hype for a veteran hero of the Hanoi Hilton: this is for real.</p> <p>McCain has now closed polling gaps of between 20 and 45 points with his rival, George Bush, in the next primary appointment, South Carolina on 19 February. In New York, he has beaten back the Republican Party machine which, backing Bush, had tried to strike McCain off the ballot in some districts, citing obscure technicalities. The party has now backed down, swept aside by the sheer popularity of the man and the potential political price of its own arrogance.</p> <p>These details, however, are but symptoms of where Mc-Cain is going: in progressing from challenger to contender for the Republican nomination, McCain could detonate a revolution not only within his party but in the way modern politics work in the US.</p> <p>Now is the McCain mo-ment. Some months ago he was a little-known moral hawk urging war for Kosovo. Then a no-hoper for the Republican nomination, then suddenly a loquacious media darling, his life story charged with pain and courage.</p> <p>Now McCain is more than any of these things: for the first time, America is watching the emergence of a candidate carving out his position and political persona in the open. Voters witness the moulding of a manifesto and an entire political culture which responds to them, which breaks both the new rules of retail political packaging and the old ones of straitjacket ideology.</p> <p>And all bundled together by a man with a mischievous glint in his eye who cannot comb his own hair because he was so brutally mistreated by his Vietcong captors. By a man who feels 'mortified' because he once signed a meaningless statement that he was a 'black criminal' after four days of torture. By a man who can say: 'In prison, I fell in love with my country.'</p> <p>Predictions are dangerous, but McCain euphoria has to be tempered by reality. True, the Bush camp is scrambling, as adviser Karl Rove told The Observer , 'to look at the way we do things' - within such an edifice, tantamount to an admission of panic .</p> <p>However, McCain faces an avalanche of punishing primary battles against the national frontrunner's gold-plated machine, the $60 million and 31 state governors it has thus far amassed. New Hampshire spoke after months of campaigning by McCain in a small, maverick state. South Carolina, through which the McCain hurricane is now blowing, becomes suddenly winnable.</p> <p>But behind the gentle Carolina hills lie the steep mountain slopes of Super and Southern Tuesdays; such political fortresses as Texas, California and Florida, where the Republican apparatus and its puppet masters in big business have been preparing indirectly, since their arch-enemy Bill Clinton became President, for their man to come. And their man is George Bush.</p> <p>The establishment now threatens them more seriously than any Democrat could. 'He has,' says Rove, 'a message that is fundamentally at odds with the party.' Rove is right, and therein lies the raw, infectious excitement of McCain's candidacy; of the McCain revolution, successful or otherwise.</p> <p>McCain's aides and allies this week set out to achieve one of two things. They can proceed with what is becoming a remarkable popular revolt against not just Bush and the Democrats but the political system itself. 'Anyone happy with the status quo should vote for someone else,' says McCain.</p> <p>Or they can convince the Republican establishment that Bush cannot deliver the only thing it wants of him - the White House - and persuade big business that McCain is its man. But here lies a contradiction: it's like asking a cat-burglar to house-sit your home so that no one will steal anything.</p> <p>McCain's political heresy, or apostasy, is sampled in the way his roadshow works. It is fun-but-serious, democratic and macho; like a rolling locker room with McCain as top jock. People rib him and get ribbed back; he chastises his 'incompetent staff, most of whom are on release programmes from prison'.</p> <p>He is 'Honest John' - the good, the bad and the angry. He thrives on banter, he chews the fat, he likes, as he says, to 'shoot shit'. To Mc-Cain, flak is fuel. He teases his heiress wife Cindy about an old boyfriend she once had, calling her 'one of those girls who attended the University of Spoiled Children'.</p> <p>He tells endless jokes, some of which are quite good: 'I feel like Zsa Zsa Gabor's fifth husband - I know what to do, but I don't know how to make it interesting.' 'The scandal in Washington wasn't Monica, it was that the President turned the Lincoln Bedroom into Motel 6 and he was the bellhop.' His favourite band is Nine Inch Nails.</p> <p>McCain runs an 18-hour daily press conference with aides crammed against the back of the bus to make way for yet more reporters accustomed to the pompous arrogance of Al Gore's team, now aghast at effortless access to a presidential candidate. 'London? How many of your readers vote in Staten Island? Only kidding, take a seat, if you can keep it.'</p> <p>And not only physical access: there appears (deceptively, no doubt) to be no protective coating around the inner John McCain, whose willingness to confess his own flaws drives aides to distraction. When asked about the reprimand for his 'lack of judgment' in a savings and loan fund scandal back in Arizona, he leans forward and replies to The Observer : 'It was worse than that. What I did was wrong. ' Actually, he did hardly anything wrong at all - it was a case of what the media calls 'guilt by association' with a chancer called Keating.</p> <p>There is, then, a revolution in political style driven by the kind of man McCain is. The fact that he is now fighting politics for real does not mean that McCain's personality and life story count for any less than they did during the days of the 'McCain Swoon' at the end of last year. The love affair with the media has abated after some spats over abortion and realisation (at long last) of his impeccable conservative voting record. But McCain's own record of heroism is still his most important political asset.</p> <p>His family has been military since the era of George Washington. His grandfather was a rugged naval warrior who led his carrier task force into battle wearing a non-regulation cap and no shoes. His father was an admiral, and McCain duly went to naval academy, where he was best known for success with women (including a Brazilian supermodel) and organising break-outs to go drinking.</p> <p>Alongside such escapades, McCain developed the steel that made him proud to serve in Vietnam, where - as he puts it - 'I managed to intercept a missile with my A-4E' fighter bomber in 1967. Parachuting into a lake, he was 'rescued' by angry Vietnamese who smashed his shoulder joints, examined his other wounds and took him to prison to die.</p> <p>What followed has become a modern American legend: how McCain refused early release and for more than five years endured torture and beating; had his arms crushed; established a system of tapping so that those in solitary could tell their comrades they had not 'squealed'; was later elected 'movie teller' to narrate film plots and persistently insulted his captors, ensuring more beating.</p> <p>Bush managed to skip Vietnam after a call from Daddy caused him to jump a waiting list of 100,000 and secure a cushy number with the Texas National Guard. It is a measure of how desperate the Republican establishment is to reconquer the White House that it is prepared to cede even the holy grail of Vietnam to brand McCain a 'Clintonite'. Or to insist that his appalling temper - a major theme for a while last year - makes him unfit for the presidency.</p> <p>McCain's voting record won a zero rating from the liberal group, Americans for Democratic Action. He appears as a thoroughbred conservative on abortion, the minimum wage, the Clinton impeachment, the lot. But the candidate now carving his niche before the eyes of America is not the man who has represented Arizona for 17 years.</p> <p>In conversation, he starts off talking about campaign finance reform and the 'corrupting influence of money in politics'. Money is Bush's water of life, and this was McCain's first heresy against party orthodoxy. McCain wants a Cabinet post to oversee government and electoral reform: 'Let the warning go out.' He menaces 'the army of lobbyists who resist our campaign'.</p> <p>McCain hit trouble over this puritanism when it turned out he was also seeking favours for his main backers. Characteristically, he blames 'a system which taints us all'. With only $5 million left in the kitty after New Hampshire, McCain himself needed money to continue - and his victory on Tuesday produced a flood of it, arriving mainly by the Internet.</p> <p>But campaign finance reform was only the beginning of McCain's self-discovery. He then moves on to talk about tax, and here lies his new terrain - a new meaning to American 'conservatism' in an era of budget surplus. 'To put the surplus dollars into tax cuts,' he says, 'is not conservative policy.' Isn't it? Tax cuts are the cornerstone of Republican philosophy.</p> <p>The mathematics are these: Bush will raid $483 billion of the surplus for tax cuts of which a third goes to the top 1 per cent of incomes. McCain's plan is for a cut of only $240 billion, aimed at the lower and middle classes.</p> <p>Moreover, $150 million of McCain's cuts will be paid for by cutting back tax breaks for big business. It is dynamic stuff. 'Every tax dollar,' he says, 'now wasted on special breaks for oil companies, ethanol giants, insurance companies and the multitude of other powerful interests with their army of lobbyists is now at risk.' On the other hand, budget surplus funds will be set aside to furnish the social security trust fund.</p> <p>The premise for this rebellion is simple. 'There is,' says McCain, 'a growing gap between rich and poor in this country, and that is my concern.' His solution defies the Republican credo that what is good for the rich helps the poor. Indeed, it presumes the opposite.</p> <p>McCain has thus established a brand of conservative radicalism which trumpets 'patriotism, honour and duty' (his mantra), but also applies the fiscal prudence and antipathy towards big business of Theodore Roosevelt to the economy of Alan Greenspan. It is almost like trying to combine Reagan's language with Roosevelt's social vision. For McCain, prosperity comes from reducing the federal debt and helping the lower and lower middle classes, not by paying off the rich. He wants to 'reclaim the Republican Party's heritage of reform'.</p> <p>With such populist Republicanism, McCain has severed himself from the current theology of the party. And still we do not know (it is unlikely McCain himself knows) how far he will go from here. But already McCain's heresy must now meet the counter-charge by every dollar and ton the Bush juggernaut can muster against him - starting in South Carolina.</p> <p>This is the kind of hardline conservative country that should - but won't - bury McCain. He can relish the fact that a disporportionate number of these conservatives are veterans, to whom he pleads, in a latest circular: 'Join me in one last campaign.'</p> <p>South Carolina is a terrain of euphemisms, and for Mc-Cain they are dangerous ones. 'Pro-Life' of course means anti-abortion, and already McCain has faltered in the eyes of the Christian Right. Campaign finance reform is known as 'free speech restriction' in Republican circles down there. But, above all, there is the word 'heritage'.</p> <p>The Confederate flag flies over the state Capitol, making South Carolina a one-issue state this primary time. The Republican majority refuses to lower it; the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People has called for a boycott of the state so long as it flies. To call the flag a 'symbol of heritage' is to sympathise with the Confederacy - and to enter an entire world of further euphemisms whereby the Civil War was fought to defend 'States' Rights' (more recently a euphemism for segregation), not slavery.</p> <p>On the other hand, to call the flag a 'symbol of racism and slavery' is to be clearly on the Yankee side, and to insist that these themes were the war's raw material.</p> <p>The problem is this: both quotations - 'heritage' and 'racism' - came recently from the mouth of John McCain. While Bush, forever observant of the long haul, has said that this is matter for South Carolina alone, McCain, with his usual lust, has entered the fray.</p> <p>It is hard for McCain: he is the history man in this fight, and his family fought on the Confederate side. 'My fore-fathers fought under that flag,' he says, adding equivocally: 'I believe they believed their service was honourable'. On the other hand, McCain's senior strategist in the state is Richard Quinn, editor of the Southern Partisan newspaper, one of the flag's principal defenders.</p> <p>Whether the controversy could melt down well for McCain is unclear: the flag issue may win him some of the right-wing vote he will need in South Carolina, only to outrage much of the middle ground that should be his further down the line.</p> <p>Either way, the issue is history and only emphasises McCain as the emotional centrepiece of this election.</p> <p>He is the heart of the story - and, in his way, at the authentic heart of a new, impatient America. It now remains to be seen whether - as Bush must prove - that heart is for sale.</p>",

From now on this is no media hype for a veteran hero of the Hanoi Hilton: this is for real. McCain has now closed polling gaps of between 20 and 45 points with his rival, George Bush, in the next primary appointment, South Carolina on 19 February.

By a man who feels 'mortified' because he once signed a meaningless statement that he was a 'black criminal' after four days of torture. By a man who can say: 'In prison, I fell in love with my country.' Predictions are dangerous, but McCain euphoria has to be tempered by reality. True, the Bush camp is scrambling, as adviser Karl Rove told The Observer , 'to look at the way we do things' - within such an edifice, tantamount to an admission of panic . However, McCain faces an avalanche of punishing primary battles against the national frontrunner's gold-plated machine, the $60 million and 31 state governors it has thus far amassed. New Hampshire spoke after months of campaigning by McCain in a small, maverick state. South Carolina, through which the McCain hurricane is now blowing, becomes suddenly winnable. But behind the gentle Carolina hills lie the steep mountain slopes of Super and Southern Tuesdays; such political fortresses as Texas, California and Florida, where the Republican apparatus and its puppet masters in big business have been preparing indirectly, since their arch-enemy Bill Clinton became President, for their man to come. And their man is George Bush. The establishment now threatens them more seriously than any Democrat could. 'He has,' says Rove, 'a message that is fundamentally at odds with the party.' Rove is right, and therein lies the raw, infectious excitement of McCain's candidacy; of the McCain revolution, successful or otherwise. McCain's aides and allies this week set out to achieve one of two things. They can proceed with what is becoming a remarkable popular revolt against not just Bush and the Democrats but the political system itself. 'Anyone happy with the status quo should vote for someone else,' says McCain. Or they can convince the Republican establishment that Bush cannot deliver the only thing it wants of him - the White House - and persuade big business that McCain is its man. But here lies a contradiction: it's like asking a cat-burglar to house-sit your home so that no one will steal anything. McCain's political heresy, or apostasy, is sampled in the way his roadshow works. It is fun-but-serious, democratic and macho; like a rolling locker room with McCain as top jock. People rib him and get ribbed back; he chastises his 'incompetent staff, most of whom are on release programmes from prison'. He is 'Honest John' - the good, the bad and the angry. He thrives on banter, he chews the fat, he likes, as he says, to 'shoot shit'. To Mc-Cain, flak is fuel. He teases his heiress wife Cindy about an old boyfriend she once had, calling her 'one of those girls who attended the University of Spoiled Children'. He tells endless jokes, some of which are quite good: 'I feel like Zsa Zsa Gabor's fifth husband - I know what to do, but I don't know how to make it interesting.' 'The scandal in Washington wasn't Monica, it was that the President turned the Lincoln Bedroom into Motel 6 and he was the bellhop.' His favourite band is Nine Inch Nails. McCain runs an 18-hour daily press conference with aides crammed against the back of the bus to make way for yet more reporters accustomed to the pompous arrogance of Al Gore's team, now aghast at effortless access to a presidential candidate. 'London? How many of your readers vote in Staten Island? Only kidding, take a seat, if you can keep it.' And not only physical access: there appears (deceptively, no doubt) to be no protective coating around the inner John McCain, whose willingness to confess his own flaws drives aides to distraction. When asked about the reprimand for his 'lack of judgment' in a savings and loan fund scandal back in Arizona, he leans forward and replies to The Observer : 'It was worse than that. What I did was wrong. ' Actually, he did hardly anything wrong at all - it was a case of what the media calls 'guilt by association' with a chancer called Keating. There is, then, a revolution in political style driven by the kind of man McCain is. The fact that he is now fighting politics for real does not mean that McCain's personality and life story count for any less than they did during the days of the 'McCain Swoon' at the end of last year. The love affair with the media has abated after some spats over abortion and realisation (at long last) of his impeccable conservative voting record. But McCain's own record of heroism is still his most important political asset. His family has been military since the era of George Washington. His grandfather was a rugged naval warrior who led his carrier task force into battle wearing a non-regulation cap and no shoes. His father was an admiral, and McCain duly went to naval academy, where he was best known for success with women (including a Brazilian supermodel) and organising break-outs to go drinking. Alongside such escapades, McCain developed the steel that made him proud to serve in Vietnam, where - as he puts it - 'I managed to intercept a missile with my A-4E' fighter bomber in 1967. Parachuting into a lake, he was 'rescued' by angry Vietnamese who smashed his shoulder joints, examined his other wounds and took him to prison to die. What followed has become a modern American legend: how McCain refused early release and for more than five years endured torture and beating; had his arms crushed; established a system of tapping so that those in solitary could tell their comrades they had not 'squealed'; was later elected 'movie teller' to narrate film plots and persistently insulted his captors, ensuring more beating. Bush managed to skip Vietnam after a call from Daddy caused him to jump a waiting list of 100,000 and secure a cushy number with the Texas National Guard. It is a measure of how desperate the Republican establishment is to reconquer the White House that it is prepared to cede even the holy grail of Vietnam to brand McCain a 'Clintonite'. Or to insist that his appalling temper - a major theme for a while last year - makes him unfit for the presidency. McCain's voting record won a zero rating from the liberal group, Americans for Democratic Action. He appears as a thoroughbred conservative on abortion, the minimum wage, the Clinton impeachment, the lot. But the candidate now carving his niche before the eyes of America is not the man who has represented Arizona for 17 years. In conversation, he starts off talking about campaign finance reform and the 'corrupting influence of money in politics'. Money is Bush's water of life, and this was McCain's first heresy against party orthodoxy. McCain wants a Cabinet post to oversee government and electoral reform: 'Let the warning go out.' He menaces 'the army of lobbyists who resist our campaign'. McCain hit trouble over this puritanism when it turned out he was also seeking favours for his main backers. Characteristically, he blames 'a system which taints us all'. With only $5 million left in the kitty after New Hampshire, McCain himself needed money to continue - and his victory on Tuesday produced a flood of it, arriving mainly by the Internet. But campaign finance reform was only the beginning of McCain's self-discovery. He then moves on to talk about tax, and here lies his new terrain - a new meaning to American 'conservatism' in an era of budget surplus. 'To put the surplus dollars into tax cuts,' he says, 'is not conservative policy.' Isn't it? Tax cuts are the cornerstone of Republican philosophy. The mathematics are these: Bush will raid $483 billion of the surplus for tax cuts of which a third goes to the top 1 per cent of incomes. McCain's plan is for a cut of only $240 billion, aimed at the lower and middle classes. Moreover, $150 million of McCain's cuts will be paid for by cutting back tax breaks for big business. It is dynamic stuff. 'Every tax dollar,' he says, 'now wasted on special breaks for oil companies, ethanol giants, insurance companies and the multitude of other powerful interests with their army of lobbyists is now at risk.' On the other hand, budget surplus funds will be set aside to furnish the social security trust fund. The premise for this rebellion is simple. 'There is,' says McCain, 'a growing gap between rich and poor in this country, and that is my concern.' His solution defies the Republican credo that what is good for the rich helps the poor. Indeed, it presumes the opposite. McCain has thus established a brand of conservative radicalism which trumpets 'patriotism, honour and duty' (his mantra), but also applies the fiscal prudence and antipathy towards big business of Theodore Roosevelt to the economy of Alan Greenspan. It is almost like trying to combine Reagan's language with Roosevelt's social vision. For McCain, prosperity comes from reducing the federal debt and helping the lower and lower middle classes, not by paying off the rich. He wants to 'reclaim the Republican Party's heritage of reform'. With such populist Republicanism, McCain has severed himself from the current theology of the party. And still we do not know (it is unlikely McCain himself knows) how far he will go from here. But already McCain's heresy must now meet the counter-charge by every dollar and ton the Bush juggernaut can muster against him - starting in South Carolina. This is the kind of hardline conservative country that should - but won't - bury McCain. He can relish the fact that a disporportionate number of these conservatives are veterans, to whom he pleads, in a latest circular: 'Join me in one last campaign.' South Carolina is a terrain of euphemisms, and for Mc-Cain they are dangerous ones. 'Pro-Life' of course means anti-abortion, and already McCain has faltered in the eyes of the Christian Right. Campaign finance reform is known as 'free speech restriction' in Republican circles down there. But, above all, there is the word 'heritage'. The Confederate flag flies over the state Capitol, making South Carolina a one-issue state this primary time. The Republican majority refuses to lower it; the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People has called for a boycott of the state so long as it flies. To call the flag a 'symbol of heritage' is to sympathise with the Confederacy - and to enter an entire world of further euphemisms whereby the Civil War was fought to defend 'States' Rights' (more recently a euphemism for segregation), not slavery. On the other hand, to call the flag a 'symbol of racism and slavery' is to be clearly on the Yankee side, and to insist that these themes were the war's raw material. The problem is this: both quotations - 'heritage' and 'racism' - came recently from the mouth of John McCain. While Bush, forever observant of the long haul, has said that this is matter for South Carolina alone, McCain, with his usual lust, has entered the fray. It is hard for McCain: he is the history man in this fight, and his family fought on the Confederate side. 'My fore-fathers fought under that flag,' he says, adding equivocally: 'I believe they believed their service was honourable'. On the other hand, McCain's senior strategist in the state is Richard Quinn, editor of the Southern Partisan newspaper, one of the flag's principal defenders. Whether the controversy could melt down well for McCain is unclear: the flag issue may win him some of the right-wing vote he will need in South Carolina, only to outrage much of the middle ground that should be his further down the line. Either way, the issue is history and only emphasises McCain as the emotional centrepiece of this election. He is the heart of the story - and, in his way, at the authentic heart of a new, impatient America. It now remains to be seen whether - as Bush must prove - that heart is for sale.",

Their task was to find out whether the IRA's position on decommissioning of its arsenal would change over the next few hours in order to prevent Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, from putting the nine-week-old power-sharing government in Belfast on hold.</p> <p>The phone call never came. Their long wait for word from the republican movement delayed Ahern's flight to meet Tony Blair in Cornwall. But when Ahern finally arrived at Blair's clifftop hotel he had nothing new to report.

The British side was said to be considerably annoyed at having been misled on the prospects for some movement.</p> <p>The delay in learning there would be no movement is likely to have left Mandelson with little or no choice but to set in motion suspension of the Northern Ireland Executive and its associated bodies. It was not a move he wished to make. He privately believes the IRA will not decommisison unless the Executive is in place. He believes the republican movement is in a state of transition, but has not yet reached the logical conclusion that it must decommission.</p> <p>His only short-term hope is that by keeping in place the other elements of the Good Friday Agreement, such as the prisoner release programme and reforms to justice and police, he will be able to persuade the IRA to decommission. But that might be another year down the road.</p> <p>He does not rule out a sudden volte face this week in head-to-head talks between Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, and David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist leader, but he does not expect it. His only hope is that Sinn Fein miscalculated and did not believe he would press ahead with suspension.</p> <p>But reconciliation is not the current republican mood. Within 20 minutes of Mandelson sitting down at the end of his Commons statement on Thursday, when he accused the paramilitaries of betrayal, Adams, was on the phone to the Minister complaining about the statement he had watched on television.</p> <p>Adams said he had been told there would be a holding statement. Instead, the suspension of the Executive would kick in next Friday and the IRA was being accused of betrayal. Adams told Mandelson he was endangering his talks with the IRA. Mandelson, physically exhausted, tried to calm him down, but Adams said he would be attacking him the next day. He duly did, telling him he was a disgrace and a spin doctor for the Ulster Unionists.</p> <p>The Northern Ireland Office recognises pressure on the Sinn Fein leader is enormous. Adams has told the British Government he would be forced to resign if he had pressed the case for decommissioning further. For, even if the republican leadership wanted to decommission, they would undoubtedly encounter huge hostility among their rank and file, especially in Fermanagh and South Tyrone. A disastrous split would occur, serving no one.</p> <p>One former IRA prisoner from the Whiterock area of west Belfast encapsulated the opposition to any IRA decommissioning: 'The republican base are saying: \"We gave the leadership the ceasefire, we gave them their big jobs at Stormont, we gave them their fancy cars and their international adulation but we are not giving them our guns.\" For republicans who have accepted so much, the guns are the last line of resistance to the Sinn Fein leadership.'</p> <p>Other IRA members are not even certain the organisation's leadership is united on the question of arms. Another IRA volunteer from west Belfast who has served a long prison sentence said: 'If there was unity among the leadership about giving up something as a gesture then they would have started to persuade the base by now. But there have been no moves to change attitudes towards decommissioning on the ground, so it's clear the leadership are divided over the question as well.'</p> <p>British Ministers acknowledge they do not know how hard Adams has been trying to persuade the base to decommission. Intelligence sources will have told him about 40 people in the IRA matter, and that people like Pat Doherty will not shift.</p> <p>In republican redoubts outside Belfast the picture is bleaker. Republican sources in south Armagh, home to the IRA's most active and dangerous brigade during the Troubles, say the organisation's national leadership has been told nothing in the way of guns or explosives is being offered up from the region. They say they have accepted the overturning of so many core principles such as entry into a partitionist Assembly still under British rule, that decommissioning would be a step too far. If the republican leadership pushed for decommissioning they would risk a major split, they add.</p> <p>The trouble for Blair and Ahern is that without a move on decommissioning, and that means putting actual guns and bombs beyond use by the 22 May deadline set out in the Good Friday Agreement, the Ulster Unionist leader and Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble will resign by the end of this week. Trimble remains their best hope. If Blair was seen to abandon him, it would harden Unionist opinion still further.</p> <p>Last November, Trimble risked a historic break-up of his party by persuading it to change its 'no guns, no government' policy regarding a coalition with Sinn Fein on the Northern Ireland Executive. Trimble, pressurised by Mandelson, asked his party to take a gamble, to set up the institutions and wait for the IRA to disarm.</p> <p>Trimble did so on the basis that he believed an understanding had been reached in the 10-week talks chaired last autumn by ex-Senator George Mitchell. No guarantee was given during those talks that disarmament would occur, but it was made crystal clear the Unionists could stay in government with Sinn Fein only if there were movement. Mandelson also pointed out that the IRA appeared to endorse decommissioning in its statement at the end of the Mitchell review which said it accepted the political leadership shown by Sinn Fein.</p> <p>The moment of decision was bound to come last Monday, the date on which General John de Chastelain was due to report progress on his talks with the IRA on decommissioning. That report would come a fortnight before the meeting of the 860-strong Ulster Unionist Council empowered to direct its leadership to quit the Executive if it was not satisfied with progress on IRA arms.</p> <p>The brutal truth was that in three rounds of talks between De Chastelain and two IRA representatives, no progress was made. There was no sign the IRA was willing to decommission, offer clarity on a date by which decommissioning would start, or even discuss the means by which it would occur and be verified.</p> <p>The optimistic noises from Dublin were not matched in the private discussions with De Chastelain. Despite intense pressure over last weekend, including calls from the Catholic Church and President Bill Clinton, the IRA hunkered down. De Chastelain was not prepared to play politics with his report and it was stark in its gloom. In the only chink of light, he said decommissioning would not need to start in his opinion until late March for it to be completed in time for the May deadline. In addition, he stated the obvious, the ceasefire was holding. Faced by such a report, finally delivered to the two governments early on Tuesday morning, Mandelson and Blair knew they were running out of road. Blair was facing the moment of decision he had been seeking to avert for months. The Irish pleaded with Blair to delay publication to give them one more chance at levering the IRA to shift. Adams would be summoned to Dublin and the thumb screws applied.</p> <p>ON TUESDAY, Trimble told Blair the obvious: in the absence of suspension, he would have no option but to resign. 'We have made the move, the IRA have not.' Adams repeated again and again the deadline was an artificial Unionist construct. Decommissioning was not in his gift to deliver.</p> <p>In going for suspension, Blair had the very reluctant support of the Irish government, even if there has been disagreement over timing and tactics in the past week.</p> <p>An Irish government source explained: 'We know Trimble can't move anymore, but the suspension creates some more space for the IRA to change position. But the Irish government knows we can't ignore the issue anymore. Whether we like it or not in the Unionist mentality only a start to decommission is the real signal that the IRA's war is over for good. That means there must be decommissioning, that's the Irish position.'</p> <p>Mandelson duly made the announcement in the Commons promising suspension of the Executive would come into force this Friday. He held back from announcing Sinn Fein was in default of the agreement, which would have thrown Sinn Fein from the Assembly altogether.</p> <p>Martin McGuinness, at points close to tears, claimed the suspension was the most disastrous moment in Irish history for the past 100 years.</p> <p>The loss of Dublin's support represents a huge strategic setback. Sinn Fein and the IRA have looked to the Irish government to sponsor their interests since the first ceasefire six years ago.</p> <p>The buzzword among Irish and British officials this weekend is 'clarity', meaning a clear statement of intent from the IRA that it will decommission and provide a timetable for when the process begins and ends.</p> <p>There is little room for the two governments to play up a concession if the IRA come up with a new statement this week.</p> <p>Trimble's letter of resignation as First Minister is locked in a safe, to which the UUP's president, Josias Cunningham, holds the key. Cunningham has made it clear he will activate the resignation even if the two governments try to 'spin' a new IRA statement as a seismic shift in republican policy.</p> <p>For the IRA's part, the suspension poses a fundamental dilemma for the republican movement. There are many grassroots voices calling for a return to what the IRA does best - a surgical strike on the security forces or a prestigious target in Britain - to exert severe pressure on the British to grant more concessions to the republican movement.</p> <p>But Sinn Fein would pay a heavy price for a one-off act of IRA violence. Specifically, it would lose the sponsorship of the Irish government and its fragile alliance with the SDLP. Yet the IRA might fear that not to react would demonstrate weakness.</p> <p>Mandelson now faces the prospect of a long period of direct rule. He believes the IRA has not yet worked out the full logic of its position and that it is time for the gunmen to be stood down. Things have got to gestate, possibly for as long as a year.</p> <p>In the meantime, to prevent a political vacuum, he must keep alive the rest of the Good Friday Agreement. Michael McGimpsey, the Ulster Unionist Executive member, thinks both sides, Unionists and Sinn Fein, have nowhere else to go.</p> <p>'There will be a lot of huffing and puffing from Sinn Fein after suspension but I still believe this agreement will survive. Martin McGuinness likes being a Minister as much as I do.'</p> <p>But anger is growing on the republican side and there is a danger that Adams and McGuinness would not survive a prolonged political vacuum. One Republican source said last week: 'There's already a suspicion that they have been suckered into this by the British Government with the aim of destroying both the IRA and Sinn Fein. If they can't show the political strategy is working, where can they go?'</p> <p><b>What is in the terrorists' arsenal...on both sides</b></p> <p>Buried in a network of underground bunkers - from Co Kerry in the south-west of Ireland to Donegal, the northernmost point - are enough IRA bullets to kill every man, woman and child in Ulster. Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland the loyalist paramilitaries have enough guns and explosives to kill and maim thousands in an outright civil war. Here is an inventory based on RUC and Gardai intelligence of the number of guns and explosives held in the hands of Ireland's private armies.</p> <p><b> The Provisional IRA:</b><br> \u0095 Enough guns to arm two infantry battalions:<br> \u0095 An estimated 800 to 1,000 mainly AK47 assault rifles, the bulk of which were smuggled in from Libya in the late Eighties. <br> \u0095 Up to 400 handguns, 200 of which were posted from the United States by IRA supporters in Florida in the past two years.<br> \u0095 40 sub-machine guns. <br> \u0095 29 heavy machine guns, mainly Soviet-made DSHK weapons from Libya. <br> \u0095 25 heavy weapons including two Sam surface-to-air missiles and two Barrett Light 50 sniper rifles brought in from the US, which have killed 10 police officers and soldiers in South Armagh. <br> \u0095 Two tonnes of Semtex explosive from Libya (four tonnes have already been either used or captured by the security forces). <br> \u0095 Around 1.5 million rounds of ammunition. <br> \u0095 A vast array of home-made mortars and rocket launchers including hand-held rockets known as Prigs, can pierce armour and are used to kill RUC officers. Prigs are constructed from baked bean tins packed with Semtex and nails. The home-made equipment also includes various mortars whose warheads have knocked British Army helicopters out of the sky.</p> <p><b> Ulster Volunteer Force:</b> <br> \u0095 Around 80 AK47 rifles smuggled in from South Lebanon in 1987. <br> \u0095 Hundreds of home-made sub-machines constructed by loyalist supporters using knowledge gleaned in the Province's engineering industries. <br> \u0095 Around 100 Uzi submachine guns which are eastern European copies of the Israeli weapon used to deadly effect in close quarter killings. <br> \u0095 Two tonnes of Powergel plastic explosives. <br> \u0095 500 handguns <br> \u0095 180 grenades.</p> <p><b> The Ulster Defence Association/Ulster Freedom Fighters:</b> <br> \u0095 Around 100 Uzi submachine guns smuggled from arms dealers in the former Soviet bloc. <br> \u0095 Around 100 AK47 rifles from the Lebanon arms shipment of 1987. <br> \u0095 Several hundred home-made weapons including sub-machine guns and handguns. <br> \u0095 Several hundred factory-made handguns. <br> \u0095 Around 180 hand-grenades, mainly Soviet in origin which also came from the Lebanese arms shipment.</p> <p><b> The Real IRA:</b> <br> \u0095 Several RPG-18 rocket launchers, which are post-Soviet weapons that were bought in the former Yugoslavia last year. <br> \u0095 A dozen or so AK47 rifles. <br> \u0095 An unknown quantity of Semtex and other commercial explosive, some of which was taken from Provisional arms dumps when the Real IRA split from the Provisionals in 1987. <br> \u0095 A dozen or so handguns.</p>",

The trouble for Blair and Ahern is that without a move on decommissioning, and that means putting actual guns and bombs beyond use by the 22 May deadline set out in the Good Friday Agreement, the Ulster Unionist leader and Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble will resign by the end of this week. Trimble remains their best hope. If Blair was seen to abandon him, it would harden Unionist opinion still further. Last November, Trimble risked a historic break-up of his party by persuading it to change its 'no guns, no government' policy regarding a coalition with Sinn Fein on the Northern Ireland Executive. Trimble, pressurised by Mandelson, asked his party to take a gamble, to set up the institutions and wait for the IRA to disarm. Trimble did so on the basis that he believed an understanding had been reached in the 10-week talks chaired last autumn by ex-Senator George Mitchell. No guarantee was given during those talks that disarmament would occur, but it was made crystal clear the Unionists could stay in government with Sinn Fein only if there were movement. Mandelson also pointed out that the IRA appeared to endorse decommissioning in its statement at the end of the Mitchell review which said it accepted the political leadership shown by Sinn Fein. The moment of decision was bound to come last Monday, the date on which General John de Chastelain was due to report progress on his talks with the IRA on decommissioning. That report would come a fortnight before the meeting of the 860-strong Ulster Unionist Council empowered to direct its leadership to quit the Executive if it was not satisfied with progress on IRA arms. The brutal truth was that in three rounds of talks between De Chastelain and two IRA representatives, no progress was made. There was no sign the IRA was willing to decommission, offer clarity on a date by which decommissioning would start, or even discuss the means by which it would occur and be verified. The optimistic noises from Dublin were not matched in the private discussions with De Chastelain. Despite intense pressure over last weekend, including calls from the Catholic Church and President Bill Clinton, the IRA hunkered down. De Chastelain was not prepared to play politics with his report and it was stark in its gloom. In the only chink of light, he said decommissioning would not need to start in his opinion until late March for it to be completed in time for the May deadline. In addition, he stated the obvious, the ceasefire was holding. Faced by such a report, finally delivered to the two governments early on Tuesday morning, Mandelson and Blair knew they were running out of road. Blair was facing the moment of decision he had been seeking to avert for months. The Irish pleaded with Blair to delay publication to give them one more chance at levering the IRA to shift. Adams would be summoned to Dublin and the thumb screws applied. ON TUESDAY, Trimble told Blair the obvious: in the absence of suspension, he would have no option but to resign. 'We have made the move, the IRA have not.' Adams repeated again and again the deadline was an artificial Unionist construct. Decommissioning was not in his gift to deliver. In going for suspension, Blair had the very reluctant support of the Irish government, even if there has been disagreement over timing and tactics in the past week. An Irish government source explained: 'We know Trimble can't move anymore, but the suspension creates some more space for the IRA to change position. But the Irish government knows we can't ignore the issue anymore. Whether we like it or not in the Unionist mentality only a start to decommission is the real signal that the IRA's war is over for good. That means there must be decommissioning, that's the Irish position.' Mandelson duly made the announcement in the Commons promising suspension of the Executive would come into force this Friday. He held back from announcing Sinn Fein was in default of the agreement, which would have thrown Sinn Fein from the Assembly altogether. Martin McGuinness, at points close to tears, claimed the suspension was the most disastrous moment in Irish history for the past 100 years. The loss of Dublin's support represents a huge strategic setback. Sinn Fein and the IRA have looked to the Irish government to sponsor their interests since the first ceasefire six years ago. The buzzword among Irish and British officials this weekend is 'clarity', meaning a clear statement of intent from the IRA that it will decommission and provide a timetable for when the process begins and ends. There is little room for the two governments to play up a concession if the IRA come up with a new statement this week. Trimble's letter of resignation as First Minister is locked in a safe, to which the UUP's president, Josias Cunningham, holds the key. Cunningham has made it clear he will activate the resignation even if the two governments try to 'spin' a new IRA statement as a seismic shift in republican policy. For the IRA's part, the suspension poses a fundamental dilemma for the republican movement. There are many grassroots voices calling for a return to what the IRA does best - a surgical strike on the security forces or a prestigious target in Britain - to exert severe pressure on the British to grant more concessions to the republican movement. But Sinn Fein would pay a heavy price for a one-off act of IRA violence. Specifically, it would lose the sponsorship of the Irish government and its fragile alliance with the SDLP. Yet the IRA might fear that not to react would demonstrate weakness. Mandelson now faces the prospect of a long period of direct rule. He believes the IRA has not yet worked out the full logic of its position and that it is time for the gunmen to be stood down. Things have got to gestate, possibly for as long as a year. In the meantime, to prevent a political vacuum, he must keep alive the rest of the Good Friday Agreement. Michael McGimpsey, the Ulster Unionist Executive member, thinks both sides, Unionists and Sinn Fein, have nowhere else to go. 'There will be a lot of huffing and puffing from Sinn Fein after suspension but I still believe this agreement will survive. Martin McGuinness likes being a Minister as much as I do.' But anger is growing on the republican side and there is a danger that Adams and McGuinness would not survive a prolonged political vacuum. One Republican source said last week: 'There's already a suspicion that they have been suckered into this by the British Government with the aim of destroying both the IRA and Sinn Fein. If they can't show the political strategy is working, where can they go?' What is in the terrorists' arsenal...on both sides Buried in a network of underground bunkers - from Co Kerry in the south-west of Ireland to Donegal, the northernmost point - are enough IRA bullets to kill every man, woman and child in Ulster. Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland the loyalist paramilitaries have enough guns and explosives to kill and maim thousands in an outright civil war. Here is an inventory based on RUC and Gardai intelligence of the number of guns and explosives held in the hands of Ireland's private armies. The Provisional IRA: \u0095 Enough guns to arm two infantry battalions: \u0095 An estimated 800 to 1,000 mainly AK47 assault rifles, the bulk of which were smuggled in from Libya in the late Eighties. \u0095 Up to 400 handguns, 200 of which were posted from the United States by IRA supporters in Florida in the past two years. \u0095 40 sub-machine guns. \u0095 29 heavy machine guns, mainly Soviet-made DSHK weapons from Libya. \u0095 25 heavy weapons including two Sam surface-to-air missiles and two Barrett Light 50 sniper rifles brought in from the US, which have killed 10 police officers and soldiers in South Armagh. \u0095 Two tonnes of Semtex explosive from Libya (four tonnes have already been either used or captured by the security forces). \u0095 Around 1.5 million rounds of ammunition. \u0095 A vast array of home-made mortars and rocket launchers including hand-held rockets known as Prigs, can pierce armour and are used to kill RUC officers. Prigs are constructed from baked bean tins packed with Semtex and nails. The home-made equipment also includes various mortars whose warheads have knocked British Army helicopters out of the sky. Ulster Volunteer Force: \u0095 Around 80 AK47 rifles smuggled in from South Lebanon in 1987. \u0095 Hundreds of home-made sub-machines constructed by loyalist supporters using knowledge gleaned in the Province's engineering industries. \u0095 Around 100 Uzi submachine guns which are eastern European copies of the Israeli weapon used to deadly effect in close quarter killings. \u0095 Two tonnes of Powergel plastic explosives. \u0095 500 handguns \u0095 180 grenades. The Ulster Defence Association/Ulster Freedom Fighters: \u0095 Around 100 Uzi submachine guns smuggled from arms dealers in the former Soviet bloc. \u0095 Around 100 AK47 rifles from the Lebanon arms shipment of 1987. \u0095 Several hundred home-made weapons including sub-machine guns and handguns. \u0095 Several hundred factory-made handguns. \u0095 Around 180 hand-grenades, mainly Soviet in origin which also came from the Lebanese arms shipment. The Real IRA: \u0095 Several RPG-18 rocket launchers, which are post-Soviet weapons that were bought in the former Yugoslavia last year. \u0095 A dozen or so AK47 rifles. \u0095 An unknown quantity of Semtex and other commercial explosive, some of which was taken from Provisional arms dumps when the Real IRA split from the Provisionals in 1987. \u0095 A dozen or so handguns.",

On the walls hung tokens and memorabilia of his beloved Arsenal, framed Mirror front pages, including one of Rupert Murdoch as the devil, and a jaunty signed tie from the Chancellor Gordon Brown. 'Editor's office. How can I help you?' said his secretary, putting down her cup of peppermint tea.</p> <p>'It's Suzy Jagger, from the Daily Telegraph City Desk here,' the broadsheet's stock market reporter said. 'Is Piers Morgan around?'</p> <p>\"Fraid not,' the Mirror editor's secretary replied. 'But he won't be long. Would you like to leave a message?' On a bright yellow Post-It note she yes-yessed and okayed as she wrote '\u00a320,000. Viglen. Shares. Alan Sugar. January 17. Did you?'</p> <p>Jagger, a new recruit to the Telegraph , did not expect Morgan to return her call. A contact had tipped her off that Morgan had bought Viglen shares before his City team published an exclusive story that would force up the price. 'Fleet Street editor in insider dealing' was a scoop worth promotion or a pay rise at least - but surely he would not be so na\u00efve as to call her back straight away?</p> <p>A telephone call interrupted the announcement of the closing share prices on the London Stock Exchange. 'Hi. It's Piers Morgan. What can I do for you?' Jagger repeated the question. 'Yes. It's true. I bought about \u00a320,000 worth. They were about 150p.' No, Morgan added, he had not sold them because he thought they were a long-term investment.</p> <p>The Telegraph ran the story that night: ' Mirror editor saw his shares soar after paper tipped company.' It ignited one of the most bitterly fought battles in tabloid history, prompted calls for Morgan to resign, and sparked questions in the House of Commons. Within 24 hours the Stock Exchange, the Press Complaints Commission and the Department of Trade and Industry launched investigations into Morgan and one of the Mirror's self-styled 'City Slicker' columnists, Anil Bhoyrul, who wrote the fateful Viglen story.</p> <p>The latest salvoes were fired yesterday when the Sun dubbed Morgan an 'idiot who doesn't read his own paper' and told readers: 'You cannot trust the Mirror . They are a bunch of spivs.' And Stephen Hodgkinson, the man who reported Morgan and Bhoyrul to the Press Complaints Commission, dismissed Morgan's decision to dump his once long-term investment on Friday as 'too little too late... He should resign'.</p> <p>This weekend the story shows no sign of dying. Morgan is just one questionable deal away from being forced out. Bhoyrul, too, could find himself spending more time with his family if an internal Mirror investigation uncovers evidence that he has been using the column to make a killing on the markets. Meanwhile, Mirror Group circulation managers are anxiously eyeing sales figures for signs that the story will hit market share.</p> <p>The controversy marks an astonishing reversal of fortune for Morgan and his paper. The youngest-ever editor of a Fleet Street daily - Morgan is 34 - he is credited with single-handedly re-establishing the paper as an intelligent populist force after the title nearly folded in the wake of the Maxwell scandal. After a string of exclusives - including the scoop of the year when he revealed Cherie Blair's pregnancy - sales were rising.</p> <p>Hiring the Slickers was a popular move. The column's 'barrow boy meets City whizz-kid' style had won friends in the usual parts of the city and Morgan relished Bhoyrul's 'wide boy' image.</p> <p>With the gap between the Mirror and the Sun the narrowest for six years, the former Sun showbiz correspondent was on his way to his first Editor of the Year gong. Now, friends say, he has 'totally lost his spark'.</p> <p>Privately, he has admitted that buying the shares and the way he handled public criticism was a 'terrible lapse of judgment'. He failed to see the danger of buying and selling shares himself, mishandled the bright young Daily Telegraph reporter, mistakenly tried to face down his critics before being forced into an abject U-turn.</p> <p>Sources who have worked with Morgan blame 'a touch of spivvery' and 'over-bearing arrogance' for his troubles. One self-confessed admirer said: 'Piers is a great guy and an excellent editor. He can be funny, charming, incisive, but he is a mischief-maker who has a huge ego. He does not listen to anyone. He does it his way. He is convinced he cannot be wrong.'</p> <p>Morgan had at least two chances to avoid controversy. He missed one and ignored the other until it was too late. The first came on Tuesday afternoon. Jagger's decision to confront Morgan directly was a long shot. By dictating her question to his secretary, Jagger gave Morgan valuable time to get himself out of trouble.</p> <p>He could have 'lost' his secretary's note, told her to fob off Jagger for 24 hours saying he was busy, sold his shares, made a hefty donation to charity and then called Jagger back and told her he did not have any Viglen stock.</p> <p>There may still have been some awkward questions but with no shares in his name the story would have run for a day or two and then fizzled out. Friends say he 'simply did not realise' what he was getting into when he picked up the receiver and dialled Jagger's direct line. It was not long before he found out.</p> <p>When the Sun's night news editor read the first edition of Wednesday's Telegraph just before midnight on Tuesday, he immediately called David Yelland, editor of the Sun , at his Surrey home.

'She won't even say \"Weeeeed!\" any more,' said Frank Vose, producer of the new show for Cosgrove Hall Films. 'We have made her into a wise character who has quite a lot to say and is able to express herself clearly. A more modern, feminist vision, if you like.' While Bill and Ben will continue to talk nonsense, relying heavily on their well-established catchphrase 'flobalobalob', Weed will be shown solving all their problems and negotiating relations between a whole cast of new animal characters. Vose said: 'The old version of The Flowerpot Men does look rather dull now. We felt we needed to introduce more elements into the stories to keep children interested.' This female-friendly re-interpretation is supported by the doyenne of children's television, Floella Benjamin, the former presenter of Playschool who now makes her own programmes. 'Children have so much else distracting them these days, you do need to grab their attention,' she said. 'I think it is fine for them to change this aspect of the original programme. When the character of Weed was created most mothers stayed at home and had more of a supportive role. 'These days women are running companies and many mothers are businesswomen. Weed should reflect these changes,' said Benjamin, who organises the annual Woman of the Year lunch.",

The navy wasted no time getting to work. They gave him a shower, and while he was still wet, applied electrodes where his skin was softest.</p> <p>Then they beat him, repeatedly and cruelly.

This carried on for about 10 days.</p> <p>Then the commander of the naval cruiser Latorre, moored alongside the Esmeralda, received an urgent call for a doctor for someone seriously ill on the Esmeralda.</p> <p>The officer, Captain Carlos Fanta, appears to have been relatively humane and was suspicious about what was being done to the prisoners on the Esmeralda. He ordered one of his ship's doctors to report back at once.</p> <p>The doctor returned to say he had seen a priest laid out on the deck of the Esmeralda, his internal organs haemorrhaging so badly he would be dead in an hour. The doctor was in no doubt that the injuries came from brutal beatings. Captain Fanta ordered the injured man be taken by ambulance to a nearby naval hospital, but he was dead on arrival.</p> <p>Speaking from Madrid, where she was taking part in a demonstration outside the foreign ministry, Bennetts said yesterday: 'When Pinochet was first arrested I had the press harassing me on my doorstep and Amnesty International wanting me to speak out but I didn't. The reason was simply my sentiment towards my father (who died last year) because I know what it's like to see in print that someone you love has been tortured to death. I always wanted to protect my parents because I thought it was so horrible.'</p> <p>Home Secretary Jack Straw says he is 'minded' not to extradite Pinochet to Spain but let him return to Chile due to poor health.</p> <p>Bennetts and her English husband, who live in Madrid, learned the truth about Woodward's death from a 1975 report in The Observer. The report quoted Chilean exiles recently arrived in Britain saying that an Anglo-Chilean priest had been tortured to death by the Chilean navy.</p> <p>After a fruitless first visit to learn about her brother's death, Bennetts returned to Chile in 1991. They learned that the death had been registered at Valparaiso cemetery, and his body tossed into a communal grave.</p> <p>A priest, Fr Edward Courzet, found Captain Fanta and obtained his account of Woodward's death. The crime which made Woodward a target for Pinochet's thugs was that he rejected the formal church hierarchy and went to work among the poor.</p>",

Michael Woodward, the only British victim of the September 1973 coup led by Pinochet, which overthrew the elected government of Chile, was officially said to have died of a heart attack under questioning. Now, however, his sister has revealed the harrowing last moments of his life as the British government prepares to allow Pinochet to return to Chile without standing trial for his crimes. Patricia Bennetts has written to the Foreign Office, enclosing evidence of the circumstances of her brother's death and pleading that Pinochet be held here until the murder is investigated. She claims that the naval command in Valparaiso, where Woodward was held and killed, was closely linked to Pinochet's junta and the dictator must have known about the torture ships moored in the harbour. Woodward was among prisoners rounded up on board the Esmeralda, a ship moored outside the port. The navy wasted no time getting to work.

The officer, Captain Carlos Fanta, appears to have been relatively humane and was suspicious about what was being done to the prisoners on the Esmeralda. He ordered one of his ship's doctors to report back at once. The doctor returned to say he had seen a priest laid out on the deck of the Esmeralda, his internal organs haemorrhaging so badly he would be dead in an hour. The doctor was in no doubt that the injuries came from brutal beatings. Captain Fanta ordered the injured man be taken by ambulance to a nearby naval hospital, but he was dead on arrival. Speaking from Madrid, where she was taking part in a demonstration outside the foreign ministry, Bennetts said yesterday: 'When Pinochet was first arrested I had the press harassing me on my doorstep and Amnesty International wanting me to speak out but I didn't. The reason was simply my sentiment towards my father (who died last year) because I know what it's like to see in print that someone you love has been tortured to death. I always wanted to protect my parents because I thought it was so horrible.' Home Secretary Jack Straw says he is 'minded' not to extradite Pinochet to Spain but let him return to Chile due to poor health. Bennetts and her English husband, who live in Madrid, learned the truth about Woodward's death from a 1975 report in The Observer. The report quoted Chilean exiles recently arrived in Britain saying that an Anglo-Chilean priest had been tortured to death by the Chilean navy. After a fruitless first visit to learn about her brother's death, Bennetts returned to Chile in 1991. They learned that the death had been registered at Valparaiso cemetery, and his body tossed into a communal grave. A priest, Fr Edward Courzet, found Captain Fanta and obtained his account of Woodward's death. The crime which made Woodward a target for Pinochet's thugs was that he rejected the formal church hierarchy and went to work among the poor.",

Cash point users have been angered and confused by recent increases in the number of banks charging non-customers without warning. But Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers has been told by advisers that under a 25-year-old Act of Parliament he can force banks to warn customers of the so-called 'disloyalty charges'. Under the 1974 Prices Act, he could force every bank to flash up a message on cash point screens, stating how much it intends to charge users and giving them the opportunity to cancel the transaction. The advice follows increasing government concern about 'rip-off Britain', and comes during a review of the banking system. Less than two weeks ago, Don Cruickshank, head of the banking review team, wrote to members of the Link cash machine network expressing concern about the charges. His letter coincided with a warning from the Office of Fair Trading. OFT director-general John Bridgeman said: 'It is disagreeable that some banks appear insensitive to the fact that fixed-rate charges disproportionately penalise people who are less well-off.'

The communiqu\u00e9, issued after talks between Adams and Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, makes suspension of the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive on Friday a near certainty.</p> <p>The new statement insists the IRA represents no threat to peace. But it offers no timetable for arms decommissioning, the precondition for Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson lifting the threat to restore direct rule. Mandelson privately thinks the IRA may be a year or so away from agreeing to disarm.</p> <p>In the only ray of hope, the statement said: 'The IRA believes that this crisis can be averted and the issue of arms can be resolved. This will not be on British or unionist terms nor will it be advanced by British legislative threats. We recognise the issue of arms needs to be dealt with in an acceptable way and this is a necessary objective of a genuine peace process - for that reason we are engaged with the IICD [decommissioning body]. We have supported and will continue to support efforts to secure the resolution of the arms issue. The peace process is under no threat from the IRA.'</p> <p>Senior Ulster Unionist Party sources said yesterday that, if the British and Irish governments attempt to sell this fresh IRA statement as a shift in republican policy without actual arms being given up, Trimble would be forced to pull out of the power-sharing government.</p> <p>Neither the British Government nor the Northern Ireland Office commented on the IRA statement.

      "bodyText": "Gerry Adams has told the British Government he will be thrown out of the Sinn Fein leadership if he presses for decommissioning of IRA arms in the current political climate. Confirmation that the IRA is not in a mood to disarm came in a fresh statement from its leadership yesterday saying it would not decommission. The communiqu\u00e9, issued after talks between Adams and Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, makes suspension of the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive on Friday a near certainty. The new statement insists the IRA represents no threat to peace. But it offers no timetable for arms decommissioning, the precondition for Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson lifting the threat to restore direct rule. Mandelson privately thinks the IRA may be a year or so away from agreeing to disarm. In the only ray of hope, the statement said: 'The IRA believes that this crisis can be averted and the issue of arms can be resolved. This will not be on British or unionist terms nor will it be advanced by British legislative threats. We recognise the issue of arms needs to be dealt with in an acceptable way and this is a necessary objective of a genuine peace process - for that reason we are engaged with the IICD [decommissioning body]. We have supported and will continue to support efforts to secure the resolution of the arms issue. The peace process is under no threat from the IRA.' Senior Ulster Unionist Party sources said yesterday that, if the British and Irish governments attempt to sell this fresh IRA statement as a shift in republican policy without actual arms being given up, Trimble would be forced to pull out of the power-sharing government. Neither the British Government nor the Northern Ireland Office commented on the IRA statement. But Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Andrew Mackay said: 'This confirms, sadly, that there is not going to be decommissioning in the near future so, as we have consistently said, the Secretary of State has no alternative but to suspend the Executive and the assembly next week.

      "body": "<p>Kevin Wright knew what he needed from the age of eight. That was when he was first aware of his pathological desire to lose his left leg.</p> <p>'I just didn't want it. It didn't feel a part of me,'he says. 'I didn't understand why, but I knew I didn't want my leg.'</p> <p>Almost 30 years later, his wish was granted, thanks to a Scottish surgeon who was willing to risk international notoriety to put Kevin out of his intense emotional pain.</p> <p>Since it was unexpectedly announced last week, the case has attracted worldwide interest because there was absolutely nothing wrong with Kevin's limb. He just knew it had to go. 'By taking my leg away that surgeon has made me complete,'he says.</p> <p>The operation, which was performed by Robert Smith at Falkirk Royal Infirmary in September 1997, was both a clinical and a personal success. 'Of course I am not a different person now, but I might well be,' says Wright. 'I have happiness and contentment and life is so much more settled, so much easier.'</p> <p>From the moment news of his voluntary surgery broke on Monday, Wright's Essex home has been besieged by the media. Tabloid hacks interviewed colleagues and neighbours, but dug up nothing more revealing than the fact that he does not have the disabled sticker for his car to which he is entitled.</p> <p>Last night, as his 21-month-old son Stephen played in the background, Wright gave his first - and he insists his last - interview on the subject of his amputation and the Body Dysmorphic Disorder that caused it.</p> <p>Speaking about it is obviously not easy for him to do, but he hopes it will end some of the more prurient speculation that much recent coverage has inspired.</p> <p>Wright always knew that the way he felt about his leg was something he ought to keep secret, and as a child he did not share his thoughts with anybody.</p> <p>'I knew I couldn't be the only one to feel this way, but I couldn't find anything to help me try to understand it,'he said. 'It really wore me down. I was so desperate for help.'</p> <p>Despite the intensity of his antipathy towards his lower left leg, nobody realised how Kevin felt until he was 28, and had been married to Susan, a midwife, for seven years.</p> <p>She was 'surprised, but accepting' of the confession, and gave him the confidence to work up the courage to seek professional help. However instead of enlightenment, he found blind ignorance.</p> <p>'I encountered some very short-sighted psychiatrists who didn't know what they were talking about,'said Kevin. 'They threatened compulsory electric shock treatment and I had some nasty experiences with heavy prescribed drugs. But none of them touched the problem.'</p> <p>He was variously told he was 'off his trolley', that he was paranoid and had dementia and delusions. 'They were desperate to label me, but nothing fitted,'he said.</p> <p>As far as he was concerned, amputation above the knee was the only feasible option. He couldn't bear life with his leg intact, and confesses to having contemplated suicide when he could not locate a surgeon willing to remove it. 'Few of the medical profession knew about it, and even fewer wanted to know,'he said. 'It was total blackness.'</p> <p>Some people call his complaint Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a psychological condition where sufferers fixate on parts of their body and become convinced that they have to be changed. Nobody knows how many people are affected by it, but BDD has been estimated to be the reason for up to 7% of the plastic surgery usually performed on noses, breasts and buttocks.</p> <p>The accepted wisdom is that because it is assumed to be a psychological problem, BDD ought to be treated without surgery. In some cases psychiatrists claim to be able to alleviate the condition with psychotherapy. But that had no effect on Wright, who said he was eventually 'palmed off' with Prozac.</p> <p>Although what he was requesting was not illegal, nobody would refer him to an NHS surgeon, and few private surgeons were willing. 'I just wanted someone to recognise that I had a problem,'he said. 'I hoped to spark their interest. But there wasn't much.'</p> <p>In 1995 he finally found a surgeon in England willing to perform a private operation. Then three days before it was due to take place, it was cancelled. The hospital where it was scheduled had second thoughts.</p> <p>That was Wright's lowest point. But shortly afterwards an acquaintance mentioned a surgeon in Falkirkwho had a particular interest in amputation surgery. Robert Smith usually strives to save the legs of people suffering the effects of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease.</p> <p>A necessary part of his job, though, is performing up to 30 amputations a year. But he had never been asked to remove a healthy limb. 'I obviously thought it was controversial, but I was intrigued,'he said. 'And yes, I was touched by his story.'</p> <p>He agreed to read the two psychiatric assessments and one psychological report on Wright that had been prepared by experts, indicating BDD. Since then, Smith has read everything on the subject. Of particular interest was the work of an American neuro-scientist, Professor V S Ramachandran, author of the book Phantoms in the Brain .</p> <p>Ramachandran is now exploring the thesis that severe expressions of BDD, such as that suffered by Wright, may be caused not some psychosomatic illness, but a functional disorder within the brain that erases the limb from the mind, making it feel an entirely unwanted object.</p> <p>Like Wright, Smith is unhappy with the umbrella label BDD. He believes that people seeking amputation of healthy limbs may have one of four different conditions which can be hard to tell apart.</p> <p>Smith classifies the first group as 'psychopathic serial self-mutilators', those who seek out amputations as the ultimate in personal gratification. Secondly, there are those who try to have healthy limbs taken off so that they can become more dependent on relatives or carers.</p> <p>The third group gain vicarious sexual pleasure from the fantasy of being an amputee. The fourth group are people like Wright for whom the desire to lose a limb is an all-consuming part of life.</p> <p>'These are very distressed, troubled people, and for them surgery may be appropriate,'said Smith. 'I would not consider it for people in the other groups.'</p> <p>Smith and Wright finally met in London in early 1996. 'I came to the conclusion I would like to try and help him, but not without great trepidation because of the legal, ethical and media interest involved,'said Smith.</p> <p>Before he agreed to the operation, Smith consulted a local psychiatrist who advised him against it. He took advice from the Medical Defence Union, which sanctioned the operation on the grounds that the surgeon believed it was in the best interests of his patient, and that every check and double-check had been made.</p> <p>Eighteen months of serious consideration eventually led Smith to approach a nearby private hospital, King's Park, where he would have preferred to have done the operation. 'I didn't feel I wanted to do it on the NHS because I felt it shouldn't be asked to fund it as there was no policy on it,'said Smith.</p> <p>He had the support of the private hospital's medical advisory committee, but the managers said 'no', fearing adverse publicity. As a last resort he approached the then medical director of the Falkirk Royal Infirmary NHS Trust, who consented.</p> <p>The chief executive at the time gave the final sanction. Smith recruited a surgical and nursing team within the Infirmary who were all willing to help.</p> <p>Finally, on 16 September 1997, Wright lost his leg. The operation cost him \u00a31,400, which paid for the costs of theatre time and a five-day hospital stay. Smith waived his fee. 'Kevin is now a happy man,'he said. 'I have no regrets about it.'</p> <p>Last year, Smith was approached by another 'patient. 'I felt considerable trepidation, but that was an easier decision to reach,'he said.</p> <p>Once again the trust's medical director agreed, only this time the patient paid \u00a36,600. By the time the third prospective patient turned up last year seeking voluntary amputation, the trust had a new board of managers.</p> <p>The new chief executive referred the decision to the chairman, who had been unaware of the previous two operations. He put an immediate ban on the surgery, and ordered an internal ethical committee inquiry.</p> <p>Its report has concluded that while there was no impropriety in the decisions to proceed with the first two operations, any more would have to be closely considered by the whole board before they could be allowed.</p> <p>After last week's revelation that the amputations had taken place, the trust chairman, Ian Mullen, declared that no such operation would happen again in his hospital.</p> <p>He was responding to the outrage of local MSP Denis Canavan, who called on the Health Minister to ensure that it would never arise anywhere in Scotland.</p> <p>'What has bugged me most is the ill-informed comments of some of the MSPs. I'm sure they'd never heard of BDD till half an hour before, and it took me a year and a half to decide,'said Smith.</p> <p>'You can't just refuse people unless they are fully and carefully assessed. The surgery is a bagatelle compared to that.'</p> <p>His greatest concern is distinguishing between those with group four BDD, the who always complain about the same limb at the same level, and those with group three BDD, who fantasise about amputation and who may take offence to various limbs, increasing the chances of the condition resurfacing even after one limb has been removed.</p> <p>'It is however possible to tell the difference with close questioning,' said Smith, who believes a great deal more could be done to improve diagnosis. He is now working with a psychoanalyst, preparing an academic paper for publication in a medical journal on the decision-making process involved in agreeing to operate under such circumstances.</p> <p>He would like to see more operations for those in the fourth category like Kevin Wright.</p> <p>'There are not large numbers of people out there who might benefit,'he said. 'But there will be some, very troubled people, and at the moment the NHS is failing them.'</p> <p>He hopes the 'yuk' factor associated with such surgery will one day fade. 'The reaction to operations like these is the same as it was 30 years ago to gender reassignment,' he said.</p> <p>'That is accepted now, in rare cases, and in my opinion so should this be.'</p> <p>BDD typically emerges pre-teen, and Smith is concerned that there may be children in Scotland as young as four and five living with the secret loathing that so blighted his patients' lives.</p> <p>'They are so embarrassed and so ashamed, and they think they are the only person in the world who suffers from it when they are not,'he said. 'Surely they deserve help, not derision?'</p> <p>Wright, too, believes that more ought to be done to bring BDD, in all its forms, into the open. 'Some people start to get better as soon as they know they aren't the only one,'he said. 'That in itself may be enough to help them.'</p> <p>Others, though, are more extreme. For them, only amputation will suffice and if they cannot get help to do it properly, they may seek relief in other ways. 'I am aware of a number of people with the condition who have died as a result,'said Wright. 'Some simulate accidents, while others turn to back-street operators. It is truly tragic that they are ignored by the medical profession.'</p> <p>Much of the commentary surrounding Wright's case has lingered over the more voyeuristic aspects of BDD. There are a few internet websites for people seeking amputees for sexual gratification, and some are distinctly challenging in their content.</p> <p>Pictures of women and men with missing limbs, posing provocatively, have been described as pornographic and condemned.</p> <p>Wright describes the extreme sites as 'appalling'. For eight years he was involved in the running of a support group, OverGround, which among its other work had a website that stated it provided 'support and information for those who are attracted to others with physical disabilities, and for the people to whom we are attracted'.</p> <p>That has led the tabloid press to question his respectability and motives for wanting the amputation, but Wright vehemently defends the work of OverGround.

      "bodyText": "Kevin Wright knew what he needed from the age of eight. That was when he was first aware of his pathological desire to lose his left leg. 'I just didn't want it. It didn't feel a part of me,'he says. 'I didn't understand why, but I knew I didn't want my leg.' Almost 30 years later, his wish was granted, thanks to a Scottish surgeon who was willing to risk international notoriety to put Kevin out of his intense emotional pain. Since it was unexpectedly announced last week, the case has attracted worldwide interest because there was absolutely nothing wrong with Kevin's limb. He just knew it had to go. 'By taking my leg away that surgeon has made me complete,'he says. The operation, which was performed by Robert Smith at Falkirk Royal Infirmary in September 1997, was both a clinical and a personal success. 'Of course I am not a different person now, but I might well be,' says Wright. 'I have happiness and contentment and life is so much more settled, so much easier.' From the moment news of his voluntary surgery broke on Monday, Wright's Essex home has been besieged by the media. Tabloid hacks interviewed colleagues and neighbours, but dug up nothing more revealing than the fact that he does not have the disabled sticker for his car to which he is entitled. Last night, as his 21-month-old son Stephen played in the background, Wright gave his first - and he insists his last - interview on the subject of his amputation and the Body Dysmorphic Disorder that caused it. Speaking about it is obviously not easy for him to do, but he hopes it will end some of the more prurient speculation that much recent coverage has inspired. Wright always knew that the way he felt about his leg was something he ought to keep secret, and as a child he did not share his thoughts with anybody. 'I knew I couldn't be the only one to feel this way, but I couldn't find anything to help me try to understand it,'he said. 'It really wore me down. I was so desperate for help.' Despite the intensity of his antipathy towards his lower left leg, nobody realised how Kevin felt until he was 28, and had been married to Susan, a midwife, for seven years. She was 'surprised, but accepting' of the confession, and gave him the confidence to work up the courage to seek professional help. However instead of enlightenment, he found blind ignorance. 'I encountered some very short-sighted psychiatrists who didn't know what they were talking about,'said Kevin. 'They threatened compulsory electric shock treatment and I had some nasty experiences with heavy prescribed drugs. But none of them touched the problem.' He was variously told he was 'off his trolley', that he was paranoid and had dementia and delusions. 'They were desperate to label me, but nothing fitted,'he said. As far as he was concerned, amputation above the knee was the only feasible option. He couldn't bear life with his leg intact, and confesses to having contemplated suicide when he could not locate a surgeon willing to remove it. 'Few of the medical profession knew about it, and even fewer wanted to know,'he said. 'It was total blackness.' Some people call his complaint Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a psychological condition where sufferers fixate on parts of their body and become convinced that they have to be changed. Nobody knows how many people are affected by it, but BDD has been estimated to be the reason for up to 7% of the plastic surgery usually performed on noses, breasts and buttocks. The accepted wisdom is that because it is assumed to be a psychological problem, BDD ought to be treated without surgery. In some cases psychiatrists claim to be able to alleviate the condition with psychotherapy. But that had no effect on Wright, who said he was eventually 'palmed off' with Prozac. Although what he was requesting was not illegal, nobody would refer him to an NHS surgeon, and few private surgeons were willing. 'I just wanted someone to recognise that I had a problem,'he said. 'I hoped to spark their interest. But there wasn't much.' In 1995 he finally found a surgeon in England willing to perform a private operation. Then three days before it was due to take place, it was cancelled. The hospital where it was scheduled had second thoughts. That was Wright's lowest point. But shortly afterwards an acquaintance mentioned a surgeon in Falkirkwho had a particular interest in amputation surgery. Robert Smith usually strives to save the legs of people suffering the effects of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease. A necessary part of his job, though, is performing up to 30 amputations a year. But he had never been asked to remove a healthy limb. 'I obviously thought it was controversial, but I was intrigued,'he said. 'And yes, I was touched by his story.' He agreed to read the two psychiatric assessments and one psychological report on Wright that had been prepared by experts, indicating BDD. Since then, Smith has read everything on the subject. Of particular interest was the work of an American neuro-scientist, Professor V S Ramachandran, author of the book Phantoms in the Brain . Ramachandran is now exploring the thesis that severe expressions of BDD, such as that suffered by Wright, may be caused not some psychosomatic illness, but a functional disorder within the brain that erases the limb from the mind, making it feel an entirely unwanted object. Like Wright, Smith is unhappy with the umbrella label BDD. He believes that people seeking amputation of healthy limbs may have one of four different conditions which can be hard to tell apart. Smith classifies the first group as 'psychopathic serial self-mutilators', those who seek out amputations as the ultimate in personal gratification. Secondly, there are those who try to have healthy limbs taken off so that they can become more dependent on relatives or carers. The third group gain vicarious sexual pleasure from the fantasy of being an amputee. The fourth group are people like Wright for whom the desire to lose a limb is an all-consuming part of life. 'These are very distressed, troubled people, and for them surgery may be appropriate,'said Smith. 'I would not consider it for people in the other groups.' Smith and Wright finally met in London in early 1996. 'I came to the conclusion I would like to try and help him, but not without great trepidation because of the legal, ethical and media interest involved,'said Smith. Before he agreed to the operation, Smith consulted a local psychiatrist who advised him against it. He took advice from the Medical Defence Union, which sanctioned the operation on the grounds that the surgeon believed it was in the best interests of his patient, and that every check and double-check had been made. Eighteen months of serious consideration eventually led Smith to approach a nearby private hospital, King's Park, where he would have preferred to have done the operation. 'I didn't feel I wanted to do it on the NHS because I felt it shouldn't be asked to fund it as there was no policy on it,'said Smith. He had the support of the private hospital's medical advisory committee, but the managers said 'no', fearing adverse publicity. As a last resort he approached the then medical director of the Falkirk Royal Infirmary NHS Trust, who consented. The chief executive at the time gave the final sanction. Smith recruited a surgical and nursing team within the Infirmary who were all willing to help. Finally, on 16 September 1997, Wright lost his leg. The operation cost him \u00a31,400, which paid for the costs of theatre time and a five-day hospital stay. Smith waived his fee. 'Kevin is now a happy man,'he said. 'I have no regrets about it.' Last year, Smith was approached by another 'patient. 'I felt considerable trepidation, but that was an easier decision to reach,'he said. Once again the trust's medical director agreed, only this time the patient paid \u00a36,600. By the time the third prospective patient turned up last year seeking voluntary amputation, the trust had a new board of managers. The new chief executive referred the decision to the chairman, who had been unaware of the previous two operations. He put an immediate ban on the surgery, and ordered an internal ethical committee inquiry. Its report has concluded that while there was no impropriety in the decisions to proceed with the first two operations, any more would have to be closely considered by the whole board before they could be allowed. After last week's revelation that the amputations had taken place, the trust chairman, Ian Mullen, declared that no such operation would happen again in his hospital. He was responding to the outrage of local MSP Denis Canavan, who called on the Health Minister to ensure that it would never arise anywhere in Scotland. 'What has bugged me most is the ill-informed comments of some of the MSPs. I'm sure they'd never heard of BDD till half an hour before, and it took me a year and a half to decide,'said Smith. 'You can't just refuse people unless they are fully and carefully assessed. The surgery is a bagatelle compared to that.' His greatest concern is distinguishing between those with group four BDD, the who always complain about the same limb at the same level, and those with group three BDD, who fantasise about amputation and who may take offence to various limbs, increasing the chances of the condition resurfacing even after one limb has been removed. 'It is however possible to tell the difference with close questioning,' said Smith, who believes a great deal more could be done to improve diagnosis. He is now working with a psychoanalyst, preparing an academic paper for publication in a medical journal on the decision-making process involved in agreeing to operate under such circumstances. He would like to see more operations for those in the fourth category like Kevin Wright. 'There are not large numbers of people out there who might benefit,'he said. 'But there will be some, very troubled people, and at the moment the NHS is failing them.' He hopes the 'yuk' factor associated with such surgery will one day fade. 'The reaction to operations like these is the same as it was 30 years ago to gender reassignment,' he said. 'That is accepted now, in rare cases, and in my opinion so should this be.' BDD typically emerges pre-teen, and Smith is concerned that there may be children in Scotland as young as four and five living with the secret loathing that so blighted his patients' lives. 'They are so embarrassed and so ashamed, and they think they are the only person in the world who suffers from it when they are not,'he said. 'Surely they deserve help, not derision?' Wright, too, believes that more ought to be done to bring BDD, in all its forms, into the open. 'Some people start to get better as soon as they know they aren't the only one,'he said. 'That in itself may be enough to help them.' Others, though, are more extreme. For them, only amputation will suffice and if they cannot get help to do it properly, they may seek relief in other ways. 'I am aware of a number of people with the condition who have died as a result,'said Wright. 'Some simulate accidents, while others turn to back-street operators. It is truly tragic that they are ignored by the medical profession.' Much of the commentary surrounding Wright's case has lingered over the more voyeuristic aspects of BDD. There are a few internet websites for people seeking amputees for sexual gratification, and some are distinctly challenging in their content. Pictures of women and men with missing limbs, posing provocatively, have been described as pornographic and condemned. Wright describes the extreme sites as 'appalling'. For eight years he was involved in the running of a support group, OverGround, which among its other work had a website that stated it provided 'support and information for those who are attracted to others with physical disabilities, and for the people to whom we are attracted'. That has led the tabloid press to question his respectability and motives for wanting the amputation, but Wright vehemently defends the work of OverGround. 'It is an information site that has been way ahead of the medical publications on BDD,' he said. 'It is a meeting point, not a dating agency.' The site, now closed, did not display pictures but it did carry 'lonely hearts' advertisements. Wright can understand the need for people with BDD to find sympathetic support from others sharing the same experience. 'These people are not weird freaks, they are just very unfortunate,' he said. 'Some are looking for friends, others for partners. So what? Sexuality is part of personal identity after all - able-bodied or not.' A new openness about BDD is what Kevin Wright is prepared to speak out for. He wants to see informed debate taking place, and he is bravely starting it. However he sincerely hopes he will soon be left alone to get on with his long-desired normal, happy, family life. 'I have not regretted the operation one bit,'he said. 'I don't want to think of what I'd have been like without it.'",

Faithful to the kind of objectivity Rilke learnt from his study of C\u00e9zanne, the best photographers do not visually declare their love for a person, thing or place - they simply say, 'Here it is'. The onus is on us to look carefully enough to recover their feelings.</p> <p>Look hard enough and another sense is, invariably, brought into play.

Given this elision of the visual and the verbal, it's not surprising that Eudora Welty, that rare thing - a first-rate writer and photographer, has best expressed the shifting relation between gesture and feeling: 'The human face and the human body are eloquent in themselves... and a snapshot is a moment's glimpse... into what never stops moving, never ceases to express for itself something of our common feeling. Every feeling waits upon its gesture.'</p> <p>Technical questions aside, the biography of a photographer lies in training the eye and heart to recognise such gestures, such moments, to bring them into accord, to synchronise them visually. When this traffic between eye and heart becomes instinctive (assuming, of course, that it is matched by technical facility), the photographer achieves a kind of - in this context how else can one term it? - enlightenment.</p> <p>The best account we have of this is by the American photographer William Gedney. In a journal kept during an extended stay in India in the Seventies he describes an extraordinary encounter in which the photographer's inquiring eye is itself subjected to prolonged, near psychic scrutiny: 'Mystic palmist, Tantric eye reader and coconut seller of Benares's Sonarpura district. Takes a five-minute look into my eyes and tells me that I am controlled by prem - love, indiscriminate, all-encompassing love.'</p> <p>If instead of 'all-encompassing' he had said 'all-seeing', that would have been even better.</p> <p>\u0095 All For Love is at the Hulton Getty Picture Library, 3 Jubilee Place, London SW3 3TD until 25 March.

These pictures have the intimacy of the snapshot, 'one of the highest forms of photography,' according to Goldin, 'the form of photography that is most defined by love.' Needless to say, this love is never manifest as the kind of radiant glow that suffused screen beauties in Hollywood movies of the Forties. Faithful to the kind of objectivity Rilke learnt from his study of C\u00e9zanne, the best photographers do not visually declare their love for a person, thing or place - they simply say, 'Here it is'. The onus is on us to look carefully enough to recover their feelings. Look hard enough and another sense is, invariably, brought into play. Look at Roy DeCarava's pictures of John Coltrane and his love of the music becomes audible. Look at his pictures of her hands and you are touched by Alfred Stieglitz's feelings for Georgia O'Keeffe. This weird synaesthesia of the photograph brings us close to the essence of romantic love itself; never tiring of watching what the beloved says. Given this elision of the visual and the verbal, it's not surprising that Eudora Welty, that rare thing - a first-rate writer and photographer, has best expressed the shifting relation between gesture and feeling: 'The human face and the human body are eloquent in themselves... and a snapshot is a moment's glimpse... into what never stops moving, never ceases to express for itself something of our common feeling. Every feeling waits upon its gesture.' Technical questions aside, the biography of a photographer lies in training the eye and heart to recognise such gestures, such moments, to bring them into accord, to synchronise them visually. When this traffic between eye and heart becomes instinctive (assuming, of course, that it is matched by technical facility), the photographer achieves a kind of - in this context how else can one term it? - enlightenment. The best account we have of this is by the American photographer William Gedney. In a journal kept during an extended stay in India in the Seventies he describes an extraordinary encounter in which the photographer's inquiring eye is itself subjected to prolonged, near psychic scrutiny: 'Mystic palmist, Tantric eye reader and coconut seller of Benares's Sonarpura district. Takes a five-minute look into my eyes and tells me that I am controlled by prem - love, indiscriminate, all-encompassing love.' If instead of 'all-encompassing' he had said 'all-seeing', that would have been even better. \u0095 All For Love is at the Hulton Getty Picture Library, 3 Jubilee Place, London SW3 3TD until 25 March.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b> Otello </b> Royal Opera House <p><b> Birmingham Contemporary Music Group</b> CBSO Centre, Birmingham </p> <p>Historically dismissed as a dud in spite of its initial success, Rossini's <b> Otello</b> has two unassailable strengths: it gets better and it ends briskly. By the time you leave the theatre, three-and-a-half hours after entering, you feel quite bright about the whole affair. The protracted, irrelevant overture - as well suited to The Thieving Magpie as to a Shakespearean tragedy - has become a dim memory, the first act a mere haze of dramatic inactivity with some pretty music. </p> <p>In addition, with a good performance you hear three tenors scaling the kind of high-wire vocal repertory which puts singing on a par with other pinnacles of physical achievement. Early nineteenth-century opera, more than any other, demands that singers have the flexibility of a gymnast, the stamina of an athlete, the intricate delicacy of a vocal lace-maker. </p> <p>Only the musically acute can transform such sport and craft to high art. The Royal Opera's new production, which originated at the Rossini Opera Festival, Pesaro, scored highly in that respect. With a cast led by the incomparable Rossinian Bruce Ford, with Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez as Roderigo and Octavio Arevalo as Iago, this was a singer's show, a wise approach for such an uneven work. The orchestra, conducted by Gianluigi Gelmetti, improved vastly after a rough start, with nimble woodwind playing and a steady growth of energy and flair. </p> <p>In this 1816 opera written for Naples, the young Rossini and his librettist Francesco Berio di Salsa showed only a passing allegiance to the Elizabethan original. An alternative happy ending was even provided for the 1820 Rome season to quell papal outrage at a work with a murder and a suicide at its climax. </p> <p>Desdemona, a vocally polished, bell-like and adroit Mariella Devia, barely appears on stage with Otello. They have no love duet in which to establish their feelings. While her emotions are evident, his remain obscure, bypassing amorous devotion and going straight to jealousy. Without prior knowledge of the story, you might assume Roderigo, a major part with a magnificent show-off aria (beautifully sung), was the ideal chap for her. Iago, far from being Shakespeare's (or Verdi's) embodiment of evil, is more of a stock-in-trade operatic villain. Despite a powerful duet with Otello, his motives are never entirely clear. The chorus contributes nothing to what drama survives - in marked contrast to their role as protagonists in Verdi's Otello . </p> <p>Pier Luigi Pizzi, who directed and designed, did little to help us over these hurdles. The production is conventional to the point of obduracy. Characters, dressed in replica Renaissance costumes, walk on and off stage without evident purpose. Otello's supposedly triumphant arrival was hardly noticeable. Fortunately the ensembles need no inventive staging since the music provides everything. All the performers looked good; Bruce Ford has a natural dignity and credibility on stage and Roderigo and Iago managed to appear in turn susceptible and nasty. But had anyone directed their movement? There was an occasional banging together of swords, after which their weapons dangled half-heartedly at their sides like wet umbrellas. </p> <p>Pizzi, an experienced Milanese director whose career dates back to 1951, trained originally as an architect. His eye for structure was evident in the play of columns, doorways and loggias of the realistic set, obedi ent to paintings by Carpaccio and the coloured marbles of Venice (where Rossini places the action throughout). Unfortunately, the staging gravitated against using the elegant doors or steps for their usual function since no one came or went by them. This gave the production an unintentional air of surrealism - a sensation intensified by three mobile phones going off in the stalls, as if members of the audience were ringing one another to compare notes on Ford's black wig or fixing where to dine after he'd killed Desdemona. </p> <p>In Birmingham they're better trained. No extraneous noises marred <b> Birmingham Contemporary Music Group</b> 's concert conducted by Nicholas Kraemer in which the listeners' attention became part of the performance. Now 13 years old and spreading its tentacles far beyond its home city, BCMG remains one of the best ensembles of its kind. In its lively programming and commissioning policy, it shares the innovative flair of its parent orchestra, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. Howard Skemp ton's gem-like Suite from Delicate , reviewed here last year, shone as brightly on second hearing in a programme of sympathetically contrasting works by Thomas Ad\u00e8s, Judith Weir and John Woolrich. The high point was a captivating new commission by Thea Musgrave, entitled Lamenting with Ariadne . This spirited Scottish-born composer, now in her seventies, moved to America in 1972 and has been effectively (and unjustly) cold-shouldered in Britain ever since. Her luscious miniature double concerto for viola and trumpet mirrored Ariadne's journey from desolation at the loss of Theseus to joyous abandon with the arrival of Dionysus. </p> <p>Several individual supporters had paid \u00a3100 towards this new commission. You can quite see why. ROH patrons can pay as much or more merely to sit in their seat. Is it fair that the Royal Opera House, frantically trying to learn all the variables of a complicated new environment, should be condemned for a few technical hitches when some of its patrons haven't even learned how to use their off buttons?</p>",

The orchestra, conducted by Gianluigi Gelmetti, improved vastly after a rough start, with nimble woodwind playing and a steady growth of energy and flair. In this 1816 opera written for Naples, the young Rossini and his librettist Francesco Berio di Salsa showed only a passing allegiance to the Elizabethan original. An alternative happy ending was even provided for the 1820 Rome season to quell papal outrage at a work with a murder and a suicide at its climax. Desdemona, a vocally polished, bell-like and adroit Mariella Devia, barely appears on stage with Otello. They have no love duet in which to establish their feelings. While her emotions are evident, his remain obscure, bypassing amorous devotion and going straight to jealousy. Without prior knowledge of the story, you might assume Roderigo, a major part with a magnificent show-off aria (beautifully sung), was the ideal chap for her. Iago, far from being Shakespeare's (or Verdi's) embodiment of evil, is more of a stock-in-trade operatic villain. Despite a powerful duet with Otello, his motives are never entirely clear. The chorus contributes nothing to what drama survives - in marked contrast to their role as protagonists in Verdi's Otello . Pier Luigi Pizzi, who directed and designed, did little to help us over these hurdles. The production is conventional to the point of obduracy. Characters, dressed in replica Renaissance costumes, walk on and off stage without evident purpose. Otello's supposedly triumphant arrival was hardly noticeable. Fortunately the ensembles need no inventive staging since the music provides everything. All the performers looked good; Bruce Ford has a natural dignity and credibility on stage and Roderigo and Iago managed to appear in turn susceptible and nasty. But had anyone directed their movement? There was an occasional banging together of swords, after which their weapons dangled half-heartedly at their sides like wet umbrellas. Pizzi, an experienced Milanese director whose career dates back to 1951, trained originally as an architect. His eye for structure was evident in the play of columns, doorways and loggias of the realistic set, obedi ent to paintings by Carpaccio and the coloured marbles of Venice (where Rossini places the action throughout). Unfortunately, the staging gravitated against using the elegant doors or steps for their usual function since no one came or went by them. This gave the production an unintentional air of surrealism - a sensation intensified by three mobile phones going off in the stalls, as if members of the audience were ringing one another to compare notes on Ford's black wig or fixing where to dine after he'd killed Desdemona. In Birmingham they're better trained. No extraneous noises marred Birmingham Contemporary Music Group 's concert conducted by Nicholas Kraemer in which the listeners' attention became part of the performance. Now 13 years old and spreading its tentacles far beyond its home city, BCMG remains one of the best ensembles of its kind. In its lively programming and commissioning policy, it shares the innovative flair of its parent orchestra, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. Howard Skemp ton's gem-like Suite from Delicate , reviewed here last year, shone as brightly on second hearing in a programme of sympathetically contrasting works by Thomas Ad\u00e8s, Judith Weir and John Woolrich. The high point was a captivating new commission by Thea Musgrave, entitled Lamenting with Ariadne . This spirited Scottish-born composer, now in her seventies, moved to America in 1972 and has been effectively (and unjustly) cold-shouldered in Britain ever since. Her luscious miniature double concerto for viola and trumpet mirrored Ariadne's journey from desolation at the loss of Theseus to joyous abandon with the arrival of Dionysus. Several individual supporters had paid \u00a3100 towards this new commission. You can quite see why. ROH patrons can pay as much or more merely to sit in their seat. Is it fair that the Royal Opera House, frantically trying to learn all the variables of a complicated new environment, should be condemned for a few technical hitches when some of its patrons haven't even learned how to use their off buttons?",

      "body": "<p>In last week's Observer, Angela Neustatter wrote about the hell she went through 22 years ago, when she would stagger home from a long, demanding job as a feature writer for the Guardian to a toddler son who was clearly not thriving - and desperate for more attention than a part-time mother could ever give. After one very bad evening, she decided that something had to give. That something was the desk job and all the ambitions that went with it. As big a sacrifice as that was, she has never regretted it. It was, she now thinks, the best decision she ever made. While she wouldn't dream of pretending she went on to become a perfect parent, she insists that her boys 'are happier than they would have been if I'd gone on the way I started'.</p> <p>It's a heartwarming story, especially if you know what the Guardian offices were like at the time. Many of her female colleagues will have dismissed her as a failed feminist and a shirker; most of her male colleagues would have taken her decision as proof that women cease to be serious from the moment they give birth. But instead of listening to them, she listened to her own conscience. She made the decision she believed to be the only right one, and she took the consequences without a word of complaint. I admire anyone who can do that. So why, when I read her article, or indeed any article by a woman who has faced the home/ work dilemma, and chosen her children over her career, do I feel so angry and so badly used?</p> <p>Why do I take a story that has nothing to do with me so personally? Well, the story is never just about one woman. The woman in the story always feels obliged to defend her position from her ideological detractors. So in this account, we hear about the child psychologist Donald Winnicott, who believed that certain forms of maternal neglect could cause serious and lasting psychological damage.</p> <p>We hear about a study that showed mothers became cooler and less sensitive to their children if they left them for long hours in daycare. And we hear that mothers must be the ones to oppose these practices, and to stand up for the children, as 'biological destiny puts us in the hot seat'.</p> <p>In other words, I take these articles personally because they urge me to do so. They put me in the hot seat. They invite me and all mothers in the audience to examine our consciences, review our own resolutions of the work/life dilemma and ask ourselves if, from time to time, our decision to work hasn't caused our children irreparable harm. And that makes me mad.</p> <p>It makes me mad partly because I have the following items on my rap sheet. 1) Although I have four children, I have always worked. 2) Although I wish I didn't have to work today, because I'm tired and have a headache and would give anything to walk away from this computer and take the children swimming instead, by and large I love my work, and cannot imagine life without it. 3) Although I am lucky to be able to do a lot of my work from home, I'm still mentally absent a lot of the time, as I often have to put in 70-hour weeks. 4) Once I did not see my two older children for four-and-a-half months, because I took a job at a university on the other side of the Atlantic. 5) I am away from my younger children (now aged six and eight) every week from Wednesday morning to Thursday evening, because I teach part-time at a university 90 miles away from my home.</p> <p>Last week when my eight-year-old and six-year-old did a skit about their parents, they did their father frowning as he gathered up their coats and their packed folders and herded them to school, and they did me prancing about in high heels, kissing crying children on the foreheads, and then saying in a carefree singsong voice: 'Goodbye darlings! See you on Thursday!' Has my unrelenting commitment to work harmed my children? I'll never know, but (because hardly a week goes by without someone somewhere shedding doubt on working motherhood) I doubt I'll ever stop asking the question.</p> <p>At the same time, I can't help feeling helpless rage against the way this question is framed. Because if I look around me, at the other mothers I know who work, I can't find a single one who would say she had put her work before her children. Even the ones who work hard to come across like corporate desk slaves are slaving behind the scenes to shift things around, so that they can get more time with their children.</p> <p>Although many would admit there were times in their work lives when they were 'stupid enough to buy the package', most have made not just one, but a whole string of big sacrifices in the interests of their children. And so have I. To make a long story short, I'll just mention the biggest: once upon a time, I had a good, permanent, well-paid, full-time job. I gave it up because keeping it would have meant losing my children. Not for nine or 10 hours a day. But forever. Have I ever regretted that decision? Never. Not even for a second. I am absolutely certain that my children are happier because I made that decision. And so am I. But I paid dearly for that decision, and so did they, because I earned under \u00a35,000 a year for the next five years. The children may have had more of my love and attention, but they had to go without many basics.</p> <p>When I had my first child, 21 years ago, the lady-or-the-tiger version of the work/ home dilemma had some basis in reality. A woman with a newborn child did have to make an either/ or choice, and the choice she made was all but impossible to reverse. But today's world makes a nonsense of that metaphor. Unless she is very rich, a mother who leaves her job for her chil dren is making her family financially vulnerable. Even if she has a gainfully employed husband, she cannot count on him - or his job - being there forever. And if he leaves, gets made redundant or dies? She's a fool if she assumes that the DSS will always be there to pick up the pieces. The days of income support for single mothers are numbered. The new world order requires that all able-bodied women have at least one foot in the paid economy.</p> <p>If I look around me at the home-based, child-centred mothers who outnumber full-time working mothers 10 to one in the village where I live, I have a hard time finding a single one who hasn't got the message. The only ones who aren't frightened for the future are the tiny handful who are rich. For the others, the sole topic of conversation is: where are they going to find the money that will allow them to continue to put their children first? Many have decided that the only way forward is go back into part-time work or to retrain. Almost all of them have discovered that in making this move, they have plunged their families even deeper into poverty, either because benefits get withdrawn overnight, weeks and months before their first puny pay cheques, or because the famous new safety net of credits and subsidies for working parents has humongous holes in it. For example, a mother who goes back into education cannot get help with her childcare costs unless she also spends more than 16 hours a week in paid work . When is she supposed to find the time see her children? If she has to pay the full whack for childcare, how is she going to find the money for food, transport, and rent?</p> <p>The women I know who are struggling with those dilemmas are all those who, six, seven, eight, nine years ago, chose to put their families before their careers. And how do they feel now, when they pick up the paper to read about the importance of maternal sacrifice? They are fit to be tied. They say: 'Yes, right, I did that, and I'm proud of what I've achieved. But look at how I'm being rewarded for it. Look at how little I'm valued. Look, when I fill out these employment forms, everything I've done for my children becomes a \"gap in employment\". Why?'</p> <p>It's not just the mothers who talk like this. It's the fathers, too. The work/ life dilemma may have started as a woman's issue, but now it's come of age and belongs to everybody. It is excruciatingly difficult for most families in this country to give their children the care they need and deserve while also providing them with the support and security they need just as much.</p> <p>To present caring work and paid employment as opposites - and that is what the popular debate on working motherhood does - is to forget that all families need both .</p> <p>It also suggests that when a family is not getting both, the blame must go to a working mother. If not to her personally, then to some sort of feminist cabal that led her astray with false promises. But working mothers are not the architects of the new world order. We did not meet secretly 20 years ago and dream up the care-blind employer in the flexible workforce in the free market in the global economy. We are coping and reacting like everyone else.</p> <p>The one positive thing we could do is use whatever clout we have in the working world to stand up for the importance of caring work, and the importance of supporting all those who do it. But it is very hard to make this case when the popular debate continues to cast us as child abusers.</p>",

The finding will add fuel to the flames ignited by the resignation last week of Defence Minister Peter Kilfoyle who claimed that Labour had deserted its heartlands. The report, Reaching Out , will say that some of the party's strongholds are being swamped by fragmented anti-poverty programmes by different government departments, which threaten to harm the efforts of local authorities and anti-poverty campaigners. The authors suggest that the heartlands' problem may not be a simple lack of resources or a policy vacuum, but an incoherence in approach from Whitehall. Kilfoyle, under attack from the party hierarchy, denied yesterday that he had said there was a policy vacuum at the heart of government. He had, in fact, claimed there was a lack of ideological glue. But he echoed criticisms in the report by claiming the heartlands were suffering from 'zone-itis', a reference to myriad Education Action Zones, Employment Action Zones and Health Action Zones. The cities in the North were weighed down by bureaucracy, Kilfoyle said. 'It's not joined up. I was supposed to be a Minister, but I just could not keep up with the initiatives. Too many civil servants were working in splendid isolation, with far too little contact with real people on the ground.' The chief executive of the Local Government Association, Norman Briscoe, warned the Government that there was 'a plethora of iniatives which overlap, do not necessarily have the same geographical boundaries, treat the same people and require different partnership arrangements on the ground'. Briscoe said local authorities were required to submit as many as 40 different plans to receive government cash. He met Whitehall permanent secretaries at the Civil Service College last Friday to discuss the logjam. The Cabinet Office report, overseen by Health Minister John Denham, is likely to say that too many targets conflict with one another, have been drawn up with inadequate community involvement and impose excessive reporting burdens on local partnerships. In one case it had cost a partnership \u00a310,000 simply to work out the range of government iniatives. Blair will confront critics such as Kilfoyle when he addresses the Labour local government conference in Blackpool today. The Prime Minister will say that the politics of unity must defeat the politics of division, adding that he rejects claims that the problems of the North are caused by people in the South. Kilfoyle is thinking of developing his views on urban regeneration through a new parliamentary group, likely to be called Hard Labour. He is also calling for the Treasury to hold back on the income tax cut planned for the Budget. Some of his allies are pressing him to stand for the chairmanship of the Parliamentary Labour Party, but he is unlikely to do so for fear of being seen as disloyal. John Prescott, whose Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is leading the anti-poverty programme in run down neighbourhoods, hit back at Kilfoyle. 'We have now put \u00a35 billion into housing and that is what the party wanted us to do. 'We now talk of full employment, not mass unemployment. We are reducing the waiting lists,' said the Deputy Prime Minister. 'We are doing everything we promised, something like 80 per cent plus of our manifesto has already been implemented.'",

      "body": "<p>I have received a letter expressing concern that while healthy eating is all well and good for the body, it can harm the wallet. Consuming a well-balanced diet, hitting the five-plus portions of fresh fruit or vegetables a day target, can only be beneficial when our budgets aren't stretched beyond their comfortable limits.</p> <p>The first issue must be whether or not organic is worth paying more for. Organic produce is, on average, 30-50 per cent more expensive than non-organic produce - a Waitrose organic kiwi can cost 25p, while non-organic is only 17p; an organic wholemeal loaf costs 18p per 100g, compared to 10.9p per 100g for non-organic. Organic frozen sweetcorn checks in at \u00a32.38 per kg, compared to \u00a31.58 per kg for ordinary frozen. There are some advantages to eating organic produce - you're less likely to encounter large amounts of unwanted pesticides and waxes, and more likely to have food that's fresher. Since organic produce has a shorter shelf life, supermarkets replenish stocks more frequently, which potentially means eating produce that contains higher amounts of time-sensitive nutrients, such as vitamin C.</p> <p>Still, there is an alternative. Since we know that fresh is best (the less time between picking and eating, the more vitamins and minerals the food is likely to contain), when you buy non-organic produce, wash thoroughly to remove pesticide and wax residues, and eat as soon as possible. Shopping according to the seasons is the best way with cheaper produce - it'll taste better and will probably contain more nutrients. Use soft fruits during the summer and view them as a treat, making up the bulk of your fruit intake with cheaper options, such as oranges, pears and apples. Their price belies their nutritional value - apples have recently been shown to help stave off lung infections.</p> <p>Do also consider buying frozen foods. Contrary to common perception, frozen vegetables can contain more vitamins and minerals than fresh, as manufacturers must freeze produce within a very short period of time once picked. (There is, however, no legal guideline for the word 'fresh' - food thus described may have sat in cold storage for months; the nutrients diminishing by the minute.)</p> <p>Growers of frozen foods will also only freeze ripe produce, which has a positive affect on the way the body absorbs the nutrients - unripe food can be harder to digest, meaning you derive very little nourishment. Frozen food can be cheaper, too, so penny for penny, you'll glean more nutrients. It's also convenient; getting your five portions of fresh fruit or vegetables every day is easier to attain when you can quickly and easily pop broad beans into a pasta sauce or stuff cannelloni shells with frozen spinach.</p> <p>It may not be fashionable, but tinned produce can also be nutritious and cheap. Tinned tomatoes are very economical in price and slightly higher in nutrients such as lycopene - which can reduce the incidence of cancer of the prostate - than fresh. Most tinned foods work perfectly well in soups or pasta sauces and are nutritious cupboard stockers. If you have the time, though, choose dried pulses; they have a better taste and texture than some tinned versions - chickpeas, particularly - and are substantially cheaper. Pulses are also a cheap source of protein when accompanied by carbohydrate - serve lentil soup with a slice of wholegrain bread to ensure that the body receives the right balance of amino acids. They also make meals go further - lentils go very well with meats such as pork in casseroles, or make a small piece of naturally smoked haddock much more filling. You can also use them to make chicken into rissoles - which can work out cheaper than ready-made burgers.</p> <p>Wholemeal, higher-fibre foods can be costly - wholemeal bread is still more expensive than white. High-fibre breakfast cereals also tend to cost more than low-fibre Cornflake-style cereals, but it's important to remember that fibre-filled foods (when accompanied with water) are much more satisfying; a slice of wholemeal bread can fill you up as much as two slices of white, so wholemeal foods are actually more economical. It really is worth investing in fibre. It's also worth taking your water from the tap. Over an adult lifetime we drink about 40,000 litres of water. The cost for bottled would be \u00a322,500, while the tap water bill would be approximately \u00a324.60 - including the cost of a water filter. Some of the biggest cost cons are the 'economy' ranges of processed foods such as sausages and burgers. They may seem cheaper, but when you compare the quantity and quality of the core ingredients, the chicken in the nuggets or the fish in the pie, you find that manufacturers frequently use inferior cuts and cheaper filling ingredients, such as potatoes or bread, to enable them to keep the price down. And cheaper lines in bacon and sausages often contain more water, so, by the time they're cooked, they've reduced greatly in size. All things considered, it's worth paying the extra and avoiding the economy lines if possible.</p> <p>Talking of shrinking produce, there are advantages to eating dried fruits - they're practical and can contain substantial amounts of beneficial nutrients such as calcium, even if they do contain less vitamin C than the fresh. They're also cheaper, but do bear in mind that you should ideally choose the fruits that have not been exposed to sulphur dioxide (SO2), as this preservative can interfere with vitamin and mineral absorption.</p> <p>Finally, prices really rocket when it comes to pre-prepared items. If you buy chopped carrots, washed salads or oven-ready meals, you'll pay over the odds for the time you save. Of course, for people living alone, shopping this way can be economical, because buying the small quantity of ingredients needed to make just one meal can be expensive. Ideally, those who live alone should invest in a small freezer, and make larger dishes to be used in portions. Also, do avoid designer produce; the vitamin-enhanced drinks, or cholesterol-reducing spreads, they're expensive and unnecessary. Some manufacturers will go all out to exploit our desire to become healthy, but by eating the cheaper real foods we can still reach our health goals and have spare change.</p> <p>So, healthy eating on a budget is possible, but it requires careful shopping and the know-how to be able to cook, rather than paying out for food manufacturers or fast-food outlets to do the work. It's appalling that children can go through their schooling without being taught how to cook simple foods that they'll enjoy. Learning to prepare pasta sauces, home-made soups or stews would be far more likely to get them cooking at home than the rock cakes they inevitably end up making in domestic science. Investing money in good cookery classes, that have healthy, enjoyable eating as the core goal, would be one of the best, and most cost-efficient ways for the government to improve the health of the nation.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Seventh Avenue and 32nd, Manhattan, January 2000 and the Northern Ireland Minister for Education, member of the Stormont Executive, member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, member of the Queen's Parliament and former Chief of Staff of the Provisional IRA is rooting about in a glass bowl on the breakfast bar of the Southgate Hotel for Bran Flakes.</p> <p>McGuinness arrived in New York two days ago on a working visit. At home, the decommissioning issue is heading towards a panicky crisis. In the absence of an IRA 'gesture', the Stormont Excecutive - and his ministry - may be dissolved within days of his return. If McGuinness is concerned, it doesn't show.</p> <p>Yesterday, in Washington, he shared a working lunch of stuffed pancakes and salad with the US Secretary for Education, Richard Riley in the executive suite of Riley's department overlooking Capitol Hill. Later, with their respective officials, the two education supremos discussed 'improving academic performance'.</p> <p>After lunch, McGuinness and his permanent secretary drove with Riley in a three-limo flotilla to Paint Branch High School in Maryland. The minister inspected a photosynthesis project, flunked a multiple choice question on centrifugal force ('I was never that good at physics'), conducted a one-question interview with the media studies group and posed beside some glass tubes.Driving back to Washington, McGuinness's adviser, Aidan McAteer, leaned towards the driver. 'Would you ever,' he asked, 'drop Martin off at the White House?'</p> <p>Back in New York, he and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams will shortly travel uptown to meet the ailing Cardinal O'Connor at St Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. If there's time he and Adams might squeeze in a quick fix of imperialist oppression with a visit to a Native American Museum. Meantime, he has discovered that the Bran Flakes are gone, so McGuinness settles for juice and eggs and bacon and talks about his eight-month-old grandchild, the infant son of his eldest daughter, Grainne McGuinness. 'He's a Riverdancer,' he says, putting aside his knife and fork and raising his two arms up and down in besotted, rhythmic imitation of this child. 'You just put the music on, any music and at all, and he's away bouncing. It's absolutely comical.'</p> <p>Derry, April 1972, and another meal with another journalist, this time a bottle of fizzy orange and a bun, a 'bap' bolted down in the back of a car and described by the 21-year-old McGuinness as a 'republican's tea' - a sugar -and-carbohydrate hit taken only yards from your mother's door, which you can't enter because if the soldiers see you they'll arrest you because you are now the Officer Commanding (OC) of the Derry IRA.</p> <p>Twenty-eight years ago there was no dissembling. McGuinness's membership of the IRA was openly, uneuphemistically disclosed. He had joined in 1969. 'It seemed to me,' he said at the time, 'that behind all the politics and marching, it was plain as daylight that there was an army in our town, in our country, and that they weren't there to give out flowers. Armies should be fought by armies. So, one night, I piled into a black Austin, me and five mates, and we went to see a Provo across the border. We told him our position and there were several meetings after that. Then we joined. Nothing really happened until Seamus Cusack [an unarmed nationalist] was killed and internment came soon after. Then the Provos in Derry were ordered into full-time military action. I gave up my job working in the butcher's shop.'</p> <p>The Gertrude Blane Union Hall off Times Square on 8th Avenue and 44th street. The first visit of Adams and McGuinness to immigrant republicans since they entered the Stormont Assembly. The crowd is predominantly working class, some drinking beer at the back of the hall as the band plays jigs and reels and the 'Fields of Athenry', the safe sex of republican balladry. As McGuinness is introduced, there is, as ever, that extra little ripple in the standing ovation, the nod to that part of his republican CV that once defined him in his entirety.</p> <p>'Bullshit,' yells a member of the audience as the minister rises to explain how membership of the Stormont parliament and the traditional Brits Out policy of the republican movement are 'absolutely' complementary. As the guy is simultaneously frisked and bounced out of the hall by six Friends of Sinn Fein, McGuinness says that while everyone has a right to raise those issues, they 'must raise them in a courteous manner'. Gerry Adams later describes the heckler as a 'drunk' (lest anyone think that the guy had a point) and lightens the evening by commenting on how truancy levels have fallen since Martin became minister. The crowd go 'aaaah' as he tells them about his new granddaughter's name. 'In English it means \"sparkle\",' says granddad.In a sideways reference to decommissioning, Adams muses: 'I have concerns about the short term; I have a fairly positive view of the long term.'</p> <p>Last December, Martin McGuinness took off where he left off on 9 August 1971 when he walked out of Doherty's butchers, and regained full-time employment as Sinn Fein's Minister for Education, an appointment that marked the distance travelled in the peace process to date. Because Martin McGuinness wasn't (isn't?) just any Provo. For the last three decades, McGuinness has been the hardline, public face of the IRA, variously described as 'Britain's number one terrorist,' and (in Esquire) 'The most powerful man in Britain after Rupert Murdoch'.</p> <p>There is scarcely an epithet for evil that McGuinness hasn't attracted. In a 1993 Central Television Cook Report, named and unnamed former IRA activists, claimed that McGuinness had personally murdered people, including British soldiers, and had ordered the murder of countless others as he moved through the IRA senior ranks from Derry OC to head of Northern Command to Chief of Staff.</p> <p>'He's had a taste for blood,' said a former IRA bomber, 'he's killed people.' McGuinness has denied every such allegation, while also supporting the right of the IRA to carry out the type of action he has stood accused of.</p> <p>In 1986, he told an interviewer, 'ITN [in 1974] reported that I had killed 12 soldiers in Derry; there was no substantiation for that, but whether you deny it or not it will always be attributed to you anyway... I would deny anything that would be of benefit to British Military Intelligence. The most important issue in all of this is what the people thought of me, and of the friends I associated with. The people clearly saw us in political opposition to British rule in Ireland. Some people will say that saying political opposition meant that you regarded killing British soldiers at that time as political, and we certainly did.'</p> <p>McGuinness is still believed to be on the IRA Army Council. At the very least, he is the Sinn Fein leader that the IRA most cleaves to. From Provo poster boy to Stormont minister. Republicans cope with the paradox by speaking of 'transition'.</p> <p>'Well, we might have to wait a bit longer for a united Ireland,' says McGuinness in his Stormont office, 'but from a Unionist perspective, there are many Unionists looking at this process, and looking at the British government's handling of this process and working out whether or not the British government signing up to the Good Friday Agreement is effectively a declaration of Britain's intent to, at the very least, bring about an entirely new relationship with the island of Ireland which is capable of, in their view, evolving towards a united Ireland.' It's a political aspiration that doesn't trip off the tongue quite as lightly as 'Brits Out'.</p> <p>When I point out some days later that Gerry Adams, in New York, has actually named the day the republican 'la' will 'tiocfaidh' ('day will come') as the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising - that is, in 2016, McGuinness actually blushes. 'That Gerry Adams is an awful man,' he says, 'I can just hear those phones starting to ring on that Easter Monday.'</p> <p>Unionists cope by sneering. 'I though it was never the plan for the Provos,' says Ulster Unionist Party Assembly member and education committee chairman Danny Kennedy, 'to be part of a partitionist government in Stormont.'</p> <p>McGuinness's US visit is preceded by a week of intense ministerial activity. The executive, as McGuinness says, may have 'the sword of Damocles hanging over it', but this man is attacking his brief with all the vigour of a politician with an eye on the promotional possibilities of a cabinet reshuffle.</p> <p>A visit to a Protestant school is barred to reporters. Last December, children from a number of such schools staged protests over his appointment. 'The school doesn't want publicity,' explains the acting department press officer, Derek Black. 'It's very sensitive. It's a mixed school. We'll issue a press release later.' Later, the school is revealed to be the cream of Belfast's Protestant crop, Methodist College.</p> <p>As McGuinness tells it, the Queen herself could scarcely have received a warmer welcome. 'We talked about the great success of the choir,' he announces solemnly. Instead, McGuinness's first public engagement of the New Year takes place in the Belfast offices of the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education. McGuinness is ratifying funding for two integrated schools, his first policy initiative. He enters, smiling and sober suited to a room full of flapping officials, trays of buttered brack and cream cakes, four television crews and 12 reporters.</p> <p>In his lapel he wears a small green button badge, an emblem which most people assume is the latest republican memento mori, but isn't. 'This is for the Council for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,' smiles McGuinness. And he smiles a lot. He jokes, he congratulates, he is word and statistic perfect, and the integrated schools people are utterly charmed. It is the charm that takes those who have previously viewed him as the devil incarnate by surprise. 'McGuinness would talk to a stray dog,' says his minder. 'Trimble used to hate talking to Adams,' says a Belfast journalist, 'because Adams would come in and he'd stroke his beard and say nothing, so Trimble would end up exasperated and saying things that he never meant. So he'd love it when McGuinness would come in, because he'd just yap away for hours.'</p> <p>There is also a curious courtliness about McGuinness. On a visit to his department at Rathgael House in Bangor, I tell him that I hate lifts and move to take the stairs. It's seven flights up, but McGuinness insists on accompanying me. 'My wife hates lifts, too,' he pants, 'and aeroplanes.'</p> <p>McGuinness's choice of integrated schooling as a launch pad for his ministry is not accidental. Catholics have eschewed the integrated option on the grounds that it dilutes the Catholic education option. But McGuinness is calming nerves. I may be an Old Provo, is the message, but today I'm as New Labour as Cherie Blair's bump. The buzz words are 'equality', 'choice', 'accessibility', 'excellence'. When he sees a child, he says soothingly, he doesn't see a republican child, or a loyalist child, or a Catholic child or a unionist child. He simply sees 'a child'.</p> <p>Danny Kennedy, on the other hand, sees a largely unreconstructed Provo when he sees McGuinness. In his Stormont office, the UUP man who will effectively 'mark' McGuinness in his role as education committee chairman, says that the McGuinness charm has yet to work on him. 'I don't expect it to be a warm personal relationship,' he says. 'I haven't succumbed to his charm - nor he to mine for that matter. I've met him once formally, as minister and chairman, in my office. We both accepted that we weren't there because we liked each other. I despise what he stands for; I don't know him as a man.'</p> <p>Kennedy is convinced that McGuinness's choice of the education portfolio was prompted by malice. 'He wanted to give Trimble a black eye over Trimble's decision to put a February deadline for decommissioning. There was a gasp of horror when he was nominated; there was genuine disbelief. It wasn't just because it was Sinn Fein, it was because of who he was. He played a very prominent role in the IRA in the past. He's still possibly on the Army Council of an organisation which is the most dedicated guerrilla organisation in western Europe.'</p> <p>Why was education so sensitive? 'It was as though McGuinness and the others were saying,' says Kennedy, '\"Ha, we've got your children now, so screw you\".' After the press conference, we travel to the BBC studios in McGuinness's Sinn Fein-issue, green Mondeo. McGuinness has refused to accept the ministerial Mercedes. 'I want the department to produce something less flashy,' he explains. 'Well, it wouldn't do to be driving home to the Bogside in a Merc,' says a department official,' ignorant of McGuinness's almost puritanical asceticism, a feature he shares with Gerry Adams. Martin McGuinness doesn't smoke, he gave up drinking Guinness and Powers whiskey when he joined the IRA, as much for security reasons as for a zealot's sense that if the struggle had to be pure, then so had he.</p> <p>The charm and the clean living are part of the paradox of the man, the contradiction that he rides. IRA informer Sean O'Callaghan, wrote in his 1998 memoir, Informer: the Real-life Story of One Man's fight Against Terrorism: 'Austere, a non-smoking tee-totaller and practising Catholic, he (McGuinness) is a fanatic almost beyond personal corruption, who has been, along with people like Adams, responsible for mass murder.'</p> <p>'Sometimes you'd see him out buying chips for the children's tea,' says a Derry friend, 'you'd never see him in a pub unless he was there just for a meeting. He'd go out occasionally to a restaurant with his wife, or maybe to a GAA [Gaelic Athletic Association - Irish football, hurling] game.' His wife, Bernie McGuinness (nee Canning), works occasionally in a cafe in William Street in Derry; his mother, Peggy, is a high-profile supporter of the local GAA club. His children, Grainne, Fionnuala, Fiachra and Emmet, of whom McGuinness is famously protective, have shown to date no interest in political activity.</p> <p>McGuinness's two daughters have both worked in local shops. The children have rarely, if ever, been photographed, apart from Grainne when a portrait taken by a friend won a photographic competition and attracted the attention of the News of the World. 'Sinn Fame!' screeched the 'exclusive'. En route to the BBC, after the integrated schools press conference, McGuinness's adviser, former republican activist Aidan McAteer, hands him a file. 'Here's a letter from Patrick,' says McGuinness,' he's inviting me to visit his school and he says that you'll get a great welcome and Rosie the dinner lady will give you a good feed.' In the studio, waiting to go live, McGuinness recalls his favourite Ali G interview. 'I loved the one when he was talking to [DUP] Sammy Wilson and he asked him if he was Irish and Wilson said that no he was British. So Ali G asked him what he was doing here, was he on holidays? I loved that...' The 11-plus issue is raised during the interview. It is Sinn Fein policy to abolish it, but the minister says today that he will await the outcome of the ongoing Queen's University study into the exam.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/observer/life/story/0,3879,133002,00.html\">Click here to continue with this story</a></p>",

Then the Provos in Derry were ordered into full-time military action. I gave up my job working in the butcher's shop.' The Gertrude Blane Union Hall off Times Square on 8th Avenue and 44th street. The first visit of Adams and McGuinness to immigrant republicans since they entered the Stormont Assembly. The crowd is predominantly working class, some drinking beer at the back of the hall as the band plays jigs and reels and the 'Fields of Athenry', the safe sex of republican balladry. As McGuinness is introduced, there is, as ever, that extra little ripple in the standing ovation, the nod to that part of his republican CV that once defined him in his entirety. 'Bullshit,' yells a member of the audience as the minister rises to explain how membership of the Stormont parliament and the traditional Brits Out policy of the republican movement are 'absolutely' complementary. As the guy is simultaneously frisked and bounced out of the hall by six Friends of Sinn Fein, McGuinness says that while everyone has a right to raise those issues, they 'must raise them in a courteous manner'. Gerry Adams later describes the heckler as a 'drunk' (lest anyone think that the guy had a point) and lightens the evening by commenting on how truancy levels have fallen since Martin became minister. The crowd go 'aaaah' as he tells them about his new granddaughter's name. 'In English it means \"sparkle\",' says granddad.In a sideways reference to decommissioning, Adams muses: 'I have concerns about the short term; I have a fairly positive view of the long term.' Last December, Martin McGuinness took off where he left off on 9 August 1971 when he walked out of Doherty's butchers, and regained full-time employment as Sinn Fein's Minister for Education, an appointment that marked the distance travelled in the peace process to date. Because Martin McGuinness wasn't (isn't?) just any Provo. For the last three decades, McGuinness has been the hardline, public face of the IRA, variously described as 'Britain's number one terrorist,' and (in Esquire) 'The most powerful man in Britain after Rupert Murdoch'. There is scarcely an epithet for evil that McGuinness hasn't attracted. In a 1993 Central Television Cook Report, named and unnamed former IRA activists, claimed that McGuinness had personally murdered people, including British soldiers, and had ordered the murder of countless others as he moved through the IRA senior ranks from Derry OC to head of Northern Command to Chief of Staff. 'He's had a taste for blood,' said a former IRA bomber, 'he's killed people.' McGuinness has denied every such allegation, while also supporting the right of the IRA to carry out the type of action he has stood accused of. In 1986, he told an interviewer, 'ITN [in 1974] reported that I had killed 12 soldiers in Derry; there was no substantiation for that, but whether you deny it or not it will always be attributed to you anyway... I would deny anything that would be of benefit to British Military Intelligence. The most important issue in all of this is what the people thought of me, and of the friends I associated with. The people clearly saw us in political opposition to British rule in Ireland. Some people will say that saying political opposition meant that you regarded killing British soldiers at that time as political, and we certainly did.' McGuinness is still believed to be on the IRA Army Council. At the very least, he is the Sinn Fein leader that the IRA most cleaves to. From Provo poster boy to Stormont minister. Republicans cope with the paradox by speaking of 'transition'. 'Well, we might have to wait a bit longer for a united Ireland,' says McGuinness in his Stormont office, 'but from a Unionist perspective, there are many Unionists looking at this process, and looking at the British government's handling of this process and working out whether or not the British government signing up to the Good Friday Agreement is effectively a declaration of Britain's intent to, at the very least, bring about an entirely new relationship with the island of Ireland which is capable of, in their view, evolving towards a united Ireland.' It's a political aspiration that doesn't trip off the tongue quite as lightly as 'Brits Out'. When I point out some days later that Gerry Adams, in New York, has actually named the day the republican 'la' will 'tiocfaidh' ('day will come') as the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising - that is, in 2016, McGuinness actually blushes. 'That Gerry Adams is an awful man,' he says, 'I can just hear those phones starting to ring on that Easter Monday.' Unionists cope by sneering. 'I though it was never the plan for the Provos,' says Ulster Unionist Party Assembly member and education committee chairman Danny Kennedy, 'to be part of a partitionist government in Stormont.' McGuinness's US visit is preceded by a week of intense ministerial activity. The executive, as McGuinness says, may have 'the sword of Damocles hanging over it', but this man is attacking his brief with all the vigour of a politician with an eye on the promotional possibilities of a cabinet reshuffle. A visit to a Protestant school is barred to reporters. Last December, children from a number of such schools staged protests over his appointment. 'The school doesn't want publicity,' explains the acting department press officer, Derek Black. 'It's very sensitive. It's a mixed school. We'll issue a press release later.' Later, the school is revealed to be the cream of Belfast's Protestant crop, Methodist College. As McGuinness tells it, the Queen herself could scarcely have received a warmer welcome. 'We talked about the great success of the choir,' he announces solemnly. Instead, McGuinness's first public engagement of the New Year takes place in the Belfast offices of the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education. McGuinness is ratifying funding for two integrated schools, his first policy initiative. He enters, smiling and sober suited to a room full of flapping officials, trays of buttered brack and cream cakes, four television crews and 12 reporters. In his lapel he wears a small green button badge, an emblem which most people assume is the latest republican memento mori, but isn't. 'This is for the Council for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,' smiles McGuinness. And he smiles a lot. He jokes, he congratulates, he is word and statistic perfect, and the integrated schools people are utterly charmed. It is the charm that takes those who have previously viewed him as the devil incarnate by surprise. 'McGuinness would talk to a stray dog,' says his minder. 'Trimble used to hate talking to Adams,' says a Belfast journalist, 'because Adams would come in and he'd stroke his beard and say nothing, so Trimble would end up exasperated and saying things that he never meant. So he'd love it when McGuinness would come in, because he'd just yap away for hours.' There is also a curious courtliness about McGuinness. On a visit to his department at Rathgael House in Bangor, I tell him that I hate lifts and move to take the stairs. It's seven flights up, but McGuinness insists on accompanying me. 'My wife hates lifts, too,' he pants, 'and aeroplanes.' McGuinness's choice of integrated schooling as a launch pad for his ministry is not accidental. Catholics have eschewed the integrated option on the grounds that it dilutes the Catholic education option. But McGuinness is calming nerves. I may be an Old Provo, is the message, but today I'm as New Labour as Cherie Blair's bump. The buzz words are 'equality', 'choice', 'accessibility', 'excellence'. When he sees a child, he says soothingly, he doesn't see a republican child, or a loyalist child, or a Catholic child or a unionist child. He simply sees 'a child'. Danny Kennedy, on the other hand, sees a largely unreconstructed Provo when he sees McGuinness. In his Stormont office, the UUP man who will effectively 'mark' McGuinness in his role as education committee chairman, says that the McGuinness charm has yet to work on him. 'I don't expect it to be a warm personal relationship,' he says. 'I haven't succumbed to his charm - nor he to mine for that matter. I've met him once formally, as minister and chairman, in my office. We both accepted that we weren't there because we liked each other. I despise what he stands for; I don't know him as a man.' Kennedy is convinced that McGuinness's choice of the education portfolio was prompted by malice. 'He wanted to give Trimble a black eye over Trimble's decision to put a February deadline for decommissioning. There was a gasp of horror when he was nominated; there was genuine disbelief. It wasn't just because it was Sinn Fein, it was because of who he was. He played a very prominent role in the IRA in the past. He's still possibly on the Army Council of an organisation which is the most dedicated guerrilla organisation in western Europe.' Why was education so sensitive? 'It was as though McGuinness and the others were saying,' says Kennedy, '\"Ha, we've got your children now, so screw you\".' After the press conference, we travel to the BBC studios in McGuinness's Sinn Fein-issue, green Mondeo. McGuinness has refused to accept the ministerial Mercedes. 'I want the department to produce something less flashy,' he explains. 'Well, it wouldn't do to be driving home to the Bogside in a Merc,' says a department official,' ignorant of McGuinness's almost puritanical asceticism, a feature he shares with Gerry Adams. Martin McGuinness doesn't smoke, he gave up drinking Guinness and Powers whiskey when he joined the IRA, as much for security reasons as for a zealot's sense that if the struggle had to be pure, then so had he. The charm and the clean living are part of the paradox of the man, the contradiction that he rides. IRA informer Sean O'Callaghan, wrote in his 1998 memoir, Informer: the Real-life Story of One Man's fight Against Terrorism: 'Austere, a non-smoking tee-totaller and practising Catholic, he (McGuinness) is a fanatic almost beyond personal corruption, who has been, along with people like Adams, responsible for mass murder.' 'Sometimes you'd see him out buying chips for the children's tea,' says a Derry friend, 'you'd never see him in a pub unless he was there just for a meeting. He'd go out occasionally to a restaurant with his wife, or maybe to a GAA [Gaelic Athletic Association - Irish football, hurling] game.' His wife, Bernie McGuinness (nee Canning), works occasionally in a cafe in William Street in Derry; his mother, Peggy, is a high-profile supporter of the local GAA club. His children, Grainne, Fionnuala, Fiachra and Emmet, of whom McGuinness is famously protective, have shown to date no interest in political activity. McGuinness's two daughters have both worked in local shops. The children have rarely, if ever, been photographed, apart from Grainne when a portrait taken by a friend won a photographic competition and attracted the attention of the News of the World. 'Sinn Fame!' screeched the 'exclusive'. En route to the BBC, after the integrated schools press conference, McGuinness's adviser, former republican activist Aidan McAteer, hands him a file. 'Here's a letter from Patrick,' says McGuinness,' he's inviting me to visit his school and he says that you'll get a great welcome and Rosie the dinner lady will give you a good feed.' In the studio, waiting to go live, McGuinness recalls his favourite Ali G interview. 'I loved the one when he was talking to [DUP] Sammy Wilson and he asked him if he was Irish and Wilson said that no he was British. So Ali G asked him what he was doing here, was he on holidays? I loved that...' The 11-plus issue is raised during the interview. It is Sinn Fein policy to abolish it, but the minister says today that he will await the outcome of the ongoing Queen's University study into the exam. Click here to continue with this story",

Tell that to Meret Oppenheim's 1936 fur-lined cup - or to Dada and Surrealism. Shame, then, on interviewer Lynn Barber (Life, last week) for promoting the specious bandwagon of BritArt and Sarah Lucas's fey and facile one-liners. There are further principles of creativity without which progressive art - with sophisticated ideas and sustained narratives - is not possible. Without the special, hard-won knowledge of itself, perception is a closed and misleading hall of mirrors. David Rodway Lecturer in Art Philosophy Kensington &amp; Chelsea College, London SW10",

      "body": "<p>Favio Barraclough, 75, has been watching the Pinochet case with a certain anxiety. Unlike the former Chilean dictator, he is not charged with crimes for which he may be extradited. But his role as a spy for South Africa's apartheid regime is unravelling and, fearful of an official investigation, he has gone to ground in Spain.</p> <p>The part played by the dapper former art teacher at Rugby school in an elaborate scheme called 'Operation Daisy' has emerged from the transactions of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. For more than four years the operation hoodwinked the liberal West and diverted into the security services funds sent to help fight apartheid.</p> <p>From November 1976, money from sources such as Scandinavian aid agencies, the British Overseas Development Agency and independent humanitarian groups found its way to two trust funds in South Africa. Both, it has now emerged, were set up and run by the security police - with Eduardo Joel Favio Barraclough as sole trustee.</p> <p>He was one of a network of operatives and 'sources' in Europe who carried out the orders of the South African Security Police chief, General Johan Coetzee. Together with confessed murderer Craig Williamson and British-born bomb-maker Jerry Raven, Coetzee was among the nine men granted amnesty in South Africa for the 1982 bombing of the London office of the then exiled African National Congress.</p> <p>Williamson and Raven are also among a group of security policemen who have applied for amnesty for the letter-bomb killings of academic Ruth First in Mozambique in 1982 and of teacher Jeanette Schoon and her six-year-old daughter, Katryn, in Angola two years later.</p> <p>It was Williamson who was Barraclough's 'handler' when the Spanish-born art teacher left South Africa after helping to establish one of the most successful projects of larceny ever mounted by the police.</p> <p>Barraclough had arrived in South Africa in 1974 to take up the chair of fine arts at the University of the Witwatersrand on an initial three-year contract. But within days of his arrival, growing numbers of staff and students were demanding his removal for incompetence.</p> <p>The administration compromised by appointing him director of what was to become the Getrude Posel art gallery. But he remained a professor at 'Wits', which had an international reputation as a centre of anti-apartheid struggle. He proved the ideal candidate for a scheme to provide a phoney conduit for anti-apartheid funds.</p> <p>In Williamson, Coetzee already had an agent who was acting as the liaison in South Africa for the Geneva-based International University Exchange Fund. It was a steady source of additional funding for the police.</p> <p>In mid-1976, Williamson asked leading anti-apartheid lawyer Geoff Budlender in Johannesburg to draw up trust deeds for the Prisoners Support Trust and the Education Research Trust. Barraclough, described as Wits professor and former council member of the Royal British Society of Sculptors, was sole trustee. The names of Barraclough and Budlender were used to give the trusts a superficial legitimacy. But the deeds Budlender drew up were never registered. Another set, again with Barraclough as sole trustee, was drawn up by a Pretoria legal firm with close links to the government and police.</p> <p>By then, Barraclough was in danger of losing his job. The police turned to what they called their 'friends in the media'. In the Citizen, set up and financed by the government's information de-partment, Barraclough was portrayed as a liberal-tinged intellectual. His colleagues began to think they may have done him a disservice.</p> <p>Barraclough played no further part in the trusts as the money rolled in. How much was siphoned off to private pockets and police projects will never be known. But the sums were substantial. In one case, Coetzee took 40,000 rands (\u00a34,000) and, in the name of John Davis, bought a large tract of land north of Pretoria. It became a training base for apartheid agents. Among the many who trained there was Peter Casselton, a British pilot, mercenary and spy who died in Pretoria in 1997 when a truck he was working on rolled off its supports and crushed him. It was Casselton who first mentioned the fact that a former 'Wits professor' had been part of Coetzee's network.</p> <p>Williamson also boasted to his lawyer that a South African agent in Spain had 'run the local anti-apartheid movement'. The tiny Spanish anti-apartheid movement had no record of Barraclough. But Mike Terry, longest-serving secretary of the British Anti-Apartheid Movement, remembered a Spanish delegate, Pablo Valls, who regularly attended international anti-apartheid conferences. Activists in Madrid also knew of Valls. Late last year, amid growing suspicions, he was asked to resign from the 'support South Africa' network.</p> <p>The suspicions were well founded. The name Pablo Valls-Tarrago appears on a list of security police operatives issued with undercover passports between 1986 and 1991. On 27 June, 1988, Valls-Tarrago was issued with passport P00227389 for use in an undisclosed operation.

      "bodyText": "Favio Barraclough, 75, has been watching the Pinochet case with a certain anxiety. Unlike the former Chilean dictator, he is not charged with crimes for which he may be extradited. But his role as a spy for South Africa's apartheid regime is unravelling and, fearful of an official investigation, he has gone to ground in Spain. The part played by the dapper former art teacher at Rugby school in an elaborate scheme called 'Operation Daisy' has emerged from the transactions of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. For more than four years the operation hoodwinked the liberal West and diverted into the security services funds sent to help fight apartheid. From November 1976, money from sources such as Scandinavian aid agencies, the British Overseas Development Agency and independent humanitarian groups found its way to two trust funds in South Africa. Both, it has now emerged, were set up and run by the security police - with Eduardo Joel Favio Barraclough as sole trustee. He was one of a network of operatives and 'sources' in Europe who carried out the orders of the South African Security Police chief, General Johan Coetzee. Together with confessed murderer Craig Williamson and British-born bomb-maker Jerry Raven, Coetzee was among the nine men granted amnesty in South Africa for the 1982 bombing of the London office of the then exiled African National Congress. Williamson and Raven are also among a group of security policemen who have applied for amnesty for the letter-bomb killings of academic Ruth First in Mozambique in 1982 and of teacher Jeanette Schoon and her six-year-old daughter, Katryn, in Angola two years later. It was Williamson who was Barraclough's 'handler' when the Spanish-born art teacher left South Africa after helping to establish one of the most successful projects of larceny ever mounted by the police. Barraclough had arrived in South Africa in 1974 to take up the chair of fine arts at the University of the Witwatersrand on an initial three-year contract. But within days of his arrival, growing numbers of staff and students were demanding his removal for incompetence. The administration compromised by appointing him director of what was to become the Getrude Posel art gallery. But he remained a professor at 'Wits', which had an international reputation as a centre of anti-apartheid struggle. He proved the ideal candidate for a scheme to provide a phoney conduit for anti-apartheid funds. In Williamson, Coetzee already had an agent who was acting as the liaison in South Africa for the Geneva-based International University Exchange Fund. It was a steady source of additional funding for the police. In mid-1976, Williamson asked leading anti-apartheid lawyer Geoff Budlender in Johannesburg to draw up trust deeds for the Prisoners Support Trust and the Education Research Trust. Barraclough, described as Wits professor and former council member of the Royal British Society of Sculptors, was sole trustee. The names of Barraclough and Budlender were used to give the trusts a superficial legitimacy. But the deeds Budlender drew up were never registered. Another set, again with Barraclough as sole trustee, was drawn up by a Pretoria legal firm with close links to the government and police. By then, Barraclough was in danger of losing his job. The police turned to what they called their 'friends in the media'. In the Citizen, set up and financed by the government's information de-partment, Barraclough was portrayed as a liberal-tinged intellectual. His colleagues began to think they may have done him a disservice. Barraclough played no further part in the trusts as the money rolled in. How much was siphoned off to private pockets and police projects will never be known. But the sums were substantial. In one case, Coetzee took 40,000 rands (\u00a34,000) and, in the name of John Davis, bought a large tract of land north of Pretoria. It became a training base for apartheid agents. Among the many who trained there was Peter Casselton, a British pilot, mercenary and spy who died in Pretoria in 1997 when a truck he was working on rolled off its supports and crushed him. It was Casselton who first mentioned the fact that a former 'Wits professor' had been part of Coetzee's network. Williamson also boasted to his lawyer that a South African agent in Spain had 'run the local anti-apartheid movement'. The tiny Spanish anti-apartheid movement had no record of Barraclough. But Mike Terry, longest-serving secretary of the British Anti-Apartheid Movement, remembered a Spanish delegate, Pablo Valls, who regularly attended international anti-apartheid conferences. Activists in Madrid also knew of Valls. Late last year, amid growing suspicions, he was asked to resign from the 'support South Africa' network. The suspicions were well founded. The name Pablo Valls-Tarrago appears on a list of security police operatives issued with undercover passports between 1986 and 1991. On 27 June, 1988, Valls-Tarrago was issued with passport P00227389 for use in an undisclosed operation. Valls-Tarrago is the maiden name of his Spanish mother. But the final link was provided by the spy himself. He made the elementary mistake of leaving a mobile telephone number - as Valls - with the solidarity group, Co-op Africa Austral, in Madrid. It was the same number listed at the former home of Favio Barraclough as the contact for the Anglo-Spanish professor who had worked at Wits. In a telephone interview, Barraclough said repeatedly that his name had not been mentioned at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings. He expressed grave concern that he had been linked with Williamson and others and disclosed he was writing a book which would 'give real insights into the South African story'. Terry Bell, with former TRC investigations head Dumisa Ntsebeza, is researching a book on some of the unfinished business of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.",

In that, at least, Hillary and Rudy are ideally suited to one another; many have suggested that the couple would make an ideal bride and groom.</p> <p>Last week the hors d'oeuvres were served, of a bitter flavour that candidates traditionally reserve until after Labour Day. And there was a gift for Hillary: sitting behind Giuliani's shoulder on the VIP dais at a recent function was none other than the handsome face of the man of the moment: Austria's far-right coalition partner J\u00f6rg Haider.</p> <p>Haider was one of 80 guests at, of all things, Rudy's Congress of Racial Equality dinner. The mayor warmly shook the hand of the pariah Haider, and later said - when challenged - he did not know who the chisel-jawed visitor was. 'I go to a lot of dinners,' he pleaded. 'Clip those right wings, Rudy,' gloated Hillary.</p> <p>The incident plays on to crucial battle terrain. Opinion polls find that most voters have decided one way or the other (and neck-in-neck) between Clinton and Giuliani, with the exception of an eight per cent Jewish vote. It is this which could finally decide the outcome.</p>",

True to the soap script, Hillary is fishing for celebrity endorsements - the currency of modern Democrat politics - and has netted a glittering shoal: Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Paul Newman, Glenn Close, Andre Agassi, Nicole Kidman, Barbra Streisand Michael Douglas and others, all sending cheques. Rudy has, by contrast, been hosting dinners with a smaller, more cerebral and serious crowd, and the gravitas works firmly in his favour. He has recruited Henry Kissinger, banker David Rockefeller and former diplomatic arch-hawk Jeane Kirkpatrick. Designer Bill Blass is as trendy as Giuliani gets, but he does have the most popular superstars of all who had delivered Hillary a stinging snub: the New York Yankees and their fans. For all the family drama and celebrity icing, the Clinton v Giuliani contest will be hallmarked primarily by the fundamental nastiness - for better or worse - of both candidates. In that, at least, Hillary and Rudy are ideally suited to one another; many have suggested that the couple would make an ideal bride and groom. Last week the hors d'oeuvres were served, of a bitter flavour that candidates traditionally reserve until after Labour Day. And there was a gift for Hillary: sitting behind Giuliani's shoulder on the VIP dais at a recent function was none other than the handsome face of the man of the moment: Austria's far-right coalition partner J\u00f6rg Haider. Haider was one of 80 guests at, of all things, Rudy's Congress of Racial Equality dinner. The mayor warmly shook the hand of the pariah Haider, and later said - when challenged - he did not know who the chisel-jawed visitor was. 'I go to a lot of dinners,' he pleaded. 'Clip those right wings, Rudy,' gloated Hillary. The incident plays on to crucial battle terrain. Opinion polls find that most voters have decided one way or the other (and neck-in-neck) between Clinton and Giuliani, with the exception of an eight per cent Jewish vote. It is this which could finally decide the outcome.",

      "body": "<p>'Did the old masters cheat?' That was the inflammatory cover line above David Hockney's new thinking on how a cascade of the greatest names in Western art - including Caravaggio, Raphael, Frans Hals, Vermeer, Vel\u00e1zquez and Ingres - used lenses to trace out their pictures. That was how they achieved their near-miraculous use of perspective; that was how they caught transient smiles with such a swagger.</p> <p>Hockney would regard none of this as cheating: 'The lens can't draw a line, only the hand can do that, the artist's hand and eye ... This whole insight about optical aids doesn't diminish anything; it merely suggests a different story.'</p> <p>Even so, the audacity and verve of his argument, overturning a long tradition of art connoisseurship with the flick of a pencil, has arrived like a depth-charge in the art world. Hockney is arguing that the camera obscura principle, the passing of light through a small hole into a darkened room to produce an inverted image, was taken up and modified with lenses and mirrors throughout the great age of Western painting. That - yes - they copied.</p> <p>It is a sensational idea. It directly challenges the image of the divinely-inspired Old Master catching perspective and those fleeting expressions and complicated, jumbled shapes, by pure eye and hand co-ordination, with a confident fluency modern artists can only marvel at.</p> <p>To add insult to injury, Hockney was set off on his theory by last year's great Ingres exhibition at the National Gallery in London. There he found a similarity between a room of stunning little drawings by the French master and sketches made by Andy Warhol in the 1970s using a slide projector, which are routinely dismissed by art critics as a prime example of modern machine-assisted decadence. Hockney has been pursuing his idea with the dedication of the protagonist in a crime novel, searching out paintings, art books, friends and experts, and testing the theory in his own studio by buying and learning to use a prism called a camera lucida, with which he can draw fast, accurate lines for portrait sketches. But can it be true?</p> <p>There has long been an intense argument about whether Vermeer used the camera obscura to create his paintings, particularly the great, uncannily realistic View of Delft. Lesser artists certainly used such devices. But Hockney's single most convincing candidate is Caravaggio, perhaps the most fashionable of Old Masters, who worked in dark rooms, often basements, without preparatory sketches and never let others watch him paint.</p> <p>Caravaggio was famed for his ability to capture the fleeting, for images of posed models that almost topple on to the viewer, and for his intense, artificial illumination. Apart from murder and sodomy, he was also accused by contemporary critics of lacking invention or understanding of the science of painting; and there are references to him carrying a 'glass'.</p> <p>Hockney has a simple theory of how Caravaggio worked. In a letter to Lawrence Weschler of the New Yorker, he described how the painter would divide a basement with a curtain and set up his lens. Then he 'covers the canvas with a rich dark undercoat that, being wet, reflects light back. He takes a brush and with the wrong end draws guidelines for the figures in the composition, to enable him to get the models back in position after [breaks for] resting, eating, pissing, etc ...'</p> <p>Caravaggio would then quickly fill in the difficult bits before dropping the curtain, turning the canvas round and completing the scene in the ordinary way.</p> <p>The marks quickly drawn in with the brush-handle can indeed be seen on Caravaggio paintings. But Hockney extends his argument to many other great painters, arguing that there was a whole tradition of lens and mirror aids in painting which was forgotten when photography arrived and painters lost interest in imitating nature. This explains the eerie photographic-like realism of Bellini's Doge of Venice and Holbein portraits. It explains why Renaissance portraiture abounds in left-handed people (the reverse effect, before artists learnt to correct it with mirrors). And it explains the historically sudden mastery of complex perspective and 'naturalness'.</p> <p>Academic opponents are sniffily dismissing it as a non-academic amateur's hobby-horse, without hard evidence. Other experts are simply cautious: Susan Foister, the National Gallery curator whose charges include the Holbeins, said she didn't think Holbein used mechanical aids for his portraits, but that he probably had done for the famous distorted skull in his French Ambassadors painting. 'Indeed, it is quite hard to understand how he could have painted that without a mechanical aid.'</p> <p>Hockney's supporters are marshalling and include eminent names. Martin Kemp, professor of art history at Oxford and author of The Science of Art, has been in long correspondence with Hockney and is full of admiration: 'I entirely approve of what he's doing. I think it's incredibly interesting; he's asking significant and frequently uncomfortable questions.'</p> <p>Whereas art historians would be looking for written documentary evidence, Hockney, as a major working artist, had set himself practical questions and looked for evidence embedded in the works themselves. He had, said Kemp, shown how an artist like Frans Hals might have used optical devices, glancing quickly and briefly through a lens to draw out the 'map co-ordinates' of a face, before using his skill at freely handled paint to fill and create the finished portrait. This did not conclusively prove, said Kemp, that Hals had worked as Hockney suggests, but it showed that he could have done, and still produced the fresh, spontaneous brushwork he is famous for.</p> <p>Lisa Jardine, professor of Renaissance studies at Queen Mary and Westfield, London, wrote a book called Ingenious Pursuits, charting the interweaving of art and science in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. She said of Hockney's theory: 'He's right. And we have all really known it for a long time ... But it needed somebody who could read the brush strokes, the pencil strokes. There were those of us who knew painters had always had lenses, but it needed a painter to see this.'</p> <p>Like Hockney, Jardine has come up against the hostility of critics and the public to the idea that painters used artificial aids to create convincing illusions. Part of the reason, she suggests, is that science-based explanations of art threaten the connoisseur art critics, who have accumulated expensive and valuable expertise which has little to say about lenses and 'tricks'. To borrow Bagehot's phrase about the British monarchy, it is to let light in upon magic.</p> <p>Hockney is also threatening to art academics because they don't know how to paint, and he does. He's a doer, with a doer's insight. Hockney complains: 'Many art historians regard themselves as too lofty - too concerned with the history of ideas, of iconography and so forth - to bother with questions about the mere craft of a painter's making.</p> <p>'I must say, frankly, that I'm not all that interested in what sometimes passes for art history.'</p> <p>And here is the larger significance of Hockney's challenge. It goes beyond a dispute, however fascinating, about whether the Old Masters traced some designs using lenses.</p> <p>It is also an argument about how we regard 'fine art' generally. To say they 'cheated' with camera-like techniques is silly, in the end, because it suggests that this invalidates their skills in composition, colour, imagination, the handling of paint and so on.</p> <p>Is it so qualitatively different from using grids, plumb-lines and maulsticks? Yes - for those who regard these painters as a pantheon of mysterious demigods, more than men if less than angels, anything which smacks of technical aid is blasphemy. It is akin to giving scientific explanations for the miracles of saints. And in an age which regards paintings as a substitute for religious faith, where art-worshippers mutter in hushed awe at the images in high-ceilinged public temple-galleries, this is a serious offence.</p> <p>Hockney is reminding his critics that art is not so mysterious or so prissy. It is also a physical business of making. It is not a refuge from technology and science, though a great division in Western consciousness has tried to make it so. In fact, the two have always been closely connected.</p> <p>There has been a constant and significant progress in the development of paint, from the discovery of new pigments, replacing unstable or poisonous ones (the old 'emerald green' or copper aceto-arsenite, for instance, was toxic and also sold as insecticide; 'Indian yellow' was made by heating the urine of cows fed on mango leaves; and 'Vandyke brown', made from earth, decomposed vegetation and bitumen, quickly cracked and turned black).</p> <p>Without the discovery of collapsible metal tubes in 1841, which quickly replaced animal bladders for carrying ready-mixed oil paint, the outdoor lightness and speed of Impressionism would have been far harder; Degas brilliantly exploited manufactured oil pastels; Daumier would not have been Daumier without the lithograph; Andy Warhol had his silkscreen and polymer paints, not to mention his overhead projector; the photo-realists had their air-brushes; today's artists use video, latex, household paints, aluminium and so on. And Hockney has deployed instant cameras, computers, photocopiers, fax machines and newspaper presses.</p> <p>None of this reduces artists to the slaves of the latest technology. Far from it. Hockney suggests that modern painting, from C\u00e9zanne to abstract expressionism, was partly a reaction against photography, a forced march to a different role. And if that is so, a franker understanding of the earlier relationship between lenses and painting - the 300 years when, says Hockney 'awkwardness seems to disappear completely from Western European art' - may put things in perspective.</p> <p>It may encourage a return to drawing alongside lenses, and a more relaxed and less frantic attitude to technology.</p> <p>Hockney's intervention is subversive in one final way, too. It questions the modern obsession with uniqueness, the idea that Ingres is somehow lesser if he copied lines thrown by a glass, as well as free-handing.</p> <p>Yet the history of painting is also the history of copying, both literally and by quotation, of appropriation, of modifying, working jointly and in teams, reworking and borrowing.</p> <p>Hockney himself is full of echoes of Picasso and Ingres, Manet and Hogarth.</p> <p>So, in sum, a whole way of thinking about art is challenged here - the notion of self-contained geniuses, whose skills we can no longer comprehend, cut off from the grubbier society of science and manufacturing around them, and interpreted for us today by a priesthood of art historians ...</p> <p>If Hockney is right, then a lot of this is suddenly and rudely up-ended. It is, by far, the greatest thing he has done without a brush.</p>",

Whereas art historians would be looking for written documentary evidence, Hockney, as a major working artist, had set himself practical questions and looked for evidence embedded in the works themselves. He had, said Kemp, shown how an artist like Frans Hals might have used optical devices, glancing quickly and briefly through a lens to draw out the 'map co-ordinates' of a face, before using his skill at freely handled paint to fill and create the finished portrait. This did not conclusively prove, said Kemp, that Hals had worked as Hockney suggests, but it showed that he could have done, and still produced the fresh, spontaneous brushwork he is famous for. Lisa Jardine, professor of Renaissance studies at Queen Mary and Westfield, London, wrote a book called Ingenious Pursuits, charting the interweaving of art and science in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. She said of Hockney's theory: 'He's right. And we have all really known it for a long time ... But it needed somebody who could read the brush strokes, the pencil strokes. There were those of us who knew painters had always had lenses, but it needed a painter to see this.' Like Hockney, Jardine has come up against the hostility of critics and the public to the idea that painters used artificial aids to create convincing illusions. Part of the reason, she suggests, is that science-based explanations of art threaten the connoisseur art critics, who have accumulated expensive and valuable expertise which has little to say about lenses and 'tricks'. To borrow Bagehot's phrase about the British monarchy, it is to let light in upon magic. Hockney is also threatening to art academics because they don't know how to paint, and he does. He's a doer, with a doer's insight. Hockney complains: 'Many art historians regard themselves as too lofty - too concerned with the history of ideas, of iconography and so forth - to bother with questions about the mere craft of a painter's making. 'I must say, frankly, that I'm not all that interested in what sometimes passes for art history.' And here is the larger significance of Hockney's challenge. It goes beyond a dispute, however fascinating, about whether the Old Masters traced some designs using lenses. It is also an argument about how we regard 'fine art' generally. To say they 'cheated' with camera-like techniques is silly, in the end, because it suggests that this invalidates their skills in composition, colour, imagination, the handling of paint and so on. Is it so qualitatively different from using grids, plumb-lines and maulsticks? Yes - for those who regard these painters as a pantheon of mysterious demigods, more than men if less than angels, anything which smacks of technical aid is blasphemy. It is akin to giving scientific explanations for the miracles of saints. And in an age which regards paintings as a substitute for religious faith, where art-worshippers mutter in hushed awe at the images in high-ceilinged public temple-galleries, this is a serious offence. Hockney is reminding his critics that art is not so mysterious or so prissy. It is also a physical business of making. It is not a refuge from technology and science, though a great division in Western consciousness has tried to make it so. In fact, the two have always been closely connected. There has been a constant and significant progress in the development of paint, from the discovery of new pigments, replacing unstable or poisonous ones (the old 'emerald green' or copper aceto-arsenite, for instance, was toxic and also sold as insecticide; 'Indian yellow' was made by heating the urine of cows fed on mango leaves; and 'Vandyke brown', made from earth, decomposed vegetation and bitumen, quickly cracked and turned black). Without the discovery of collapsible metal tubes in 1841, which quickly replaced animal bladders for carrying ready-mixed oil paint, the outdoor lightness and speed of Impressionism would have been far harder; Degas brilliantly exploited manufactured oil pastels; Daumier would not have been Daumier without the lithograph; Andy Warhol had his silkscreen and polymer paints, not to mention his overhead projector; the photo-realists had their air-brushes; today's artists use video, latex, household paints, aluminium and so on. And Hockney has deployed instant cameras, computers, photocopiers, fax machines and newspaper presses. None of this reduces artists to the slaves of the latest technology. Far from it. Hockney suggests that modern painting, from C\u00e9zanne to abstract expressionism, was partly a reaction against photography, a forced march to a different role. And if that is so, a franker understanding of the earlier relationship between lenses and painting - the 300 years when, says Hockney 'awkwardness seems to disappear completely from Western European art' - may put things in perspective. It may encourage a return to drawing alongside lenses, and a more relaxed and less frantic attitude to technology. Hockney's intervention is subversive in one final way, too. It questions the modern obsession with uniqueness, the idea that Ingres is somehow lesser if he copied lines thrown by a glass, as well as free-handing. Yet the history of painting is also the history of copying, both literally and by quotation, of appropriation, of modifying, working jointly and in teams, reworking and borrowing. Hockney himself is full of echoes of Picasso and Ingres, Manet and Hogarth. So, in sum, a whole way of thinking about art is challenged here - the notion of self-contained geniuses, whose skills we can no longer comprehend, cut off from the grubbier society of science and manufacturing around them, and interpreted for us today by a priesthood of art historians ... If Hockney is right, then a lot of this is suddenly and rudely up-ended. It is, by far, the greatest thing he has done without a brush.",

Phillip Cartwright of independent mortgage broker London &amp; Country says debts with less than one year to run should not count against you, provided you have a good payment record. But some lenders may deduct payments for credit card bills and longer-term structured loans from your annual income before doing the sums to work out how much you can borrow. </p> <p>This problem particularly affects twentysomethings in higher education. People who graduated in 1998 owed a staggering \u00a31 billion. The average debt was \u00a34,497. Though seventy per cent of those questioned had borrowed cheaply from the Student Loan Company, 59 per cent had gone on to take much more expensive loans from their banks. Barclays found that although graduate salaries have increased by 17 per cent in the five years since 1994, their borrowing levels spiralled by 103 per cent over the same period. Graduate finances have deteriorated partly because student grants have been abolished, and partly because of the introduction of fees for students whose parents earn more than \u00a317,370 a year. </p> <p>Worse, there are signs that fear of debt is driving hard-up students to jeopardise their academic chances by taking part-time jobs to pay their way.

Deborah is not a profligate spender - she pays \u00a3100 a week rent and goes out to the cinema or pub only once or twice a week - but she has been forced to take out loans to finance her education. 'All my debts are student loans. I've been really careful. I don't spend a lot, but each year my debts are even bigger,' she says. Like thousands of other twentysomethings, Deborah has to spend a lot of time worrying about money. Saving in a bank or building society account is the top financial priority for people in their twenties, says research organisation Mintel. While 63 per cent of 20- to 24-year-olds want to save, 38 per cent would rather buy a good holiday or new clothes and shoes, and 35 per cent would pay off debt. Only 28 per cent would spend much on having a good time. 'Twentysomethings aren't what they used to be,' says Martin Campbell at Virgin Direct.

      "body": "<p>Thousands of working parents are thought to be missing out on Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) - a new benefit that typically pays out between \u00a315 and \u00a350 a week. </p> <p>As many as 1.4 million households could be eligible for WFTC, according to the Government. The benefit replaced Family Credit last October - and is more generous. But as only 800,000 people usd to claim Family Credit, advisers are worried that up to half of those who are eligible may not be aware of their rights. </p> <p>'Lone fathers are a potential problem group,' says a spokeswoman for Gingerbread, a charity advising single parents. 'When we have spoken to them, we have sometimes found they though it related only to lone mothers.' </p> <p>WFTC was devised to help parents to hold down a job. It aims to tackle the poverty trap through which some parents found it would cost them money in lost benefits to go back to work. Under this scheme , one-child families with income of less than \u00a322,000 could qualify, as could larger families earning up to \u00a330,000. </p> <p>But claimants need to take into account all their income, potential income, childcare costs and any other expenses, such as travel involved in taking up a job.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of working parents are thought to be missing out on Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) - a new benefit that typically pays out between \u00a315 and \u00a350 a week. As many as 1.4 million households could be eligible for WFTC, according to the Government. The benefit replaced Family Credit last October - and is more generous. But as only 800,000 people usd to claim Family Credit, advisers are worried that up to half of those who are eligible may not be aware of their rights. 'Lone fathers are a potential problem group,' says a spokeswoman for Gingerbread, a charity advising single parents. 'When we have spoken to them, we have sometimes found they though it related only to lone mothers.' WFTC was devised to help parents to hold down a job. It aims to tackle the poverty trap through which some parents found it would cost them money in lost benefits to go back to work. Under this scheme , one-child families with income of less than \u00a322,000 could qualify, as could larger families earning up to \u00a330,000. But claimants need to take into account all their income, potential income, childcare costs and any other expenses, such as travel involved in taking up a job. There is no fixed rate for WFTC: it depends on individual circumstances. Advisers are finding that WFTC is generally running more smoothly than expected, and is better explained and more swiftly handled that Family Credit. Part of the improvement may be down to the fact that Family Credit was administered by the Department of Social Security, but WFTC, described as a 'tax credit', rather than a benefit, is being handled by the Inland Revenue, a far more accessible and efficient department than the DSS. Even so, there are some teething problems and pitfalls. 'The overriding issue,' says Alison Garnham of the National Council for One Parent Families, 'is that lone parents are getting estimates of their entitlement from the Government's WFTC helpline - but they need to get a proper benefits check, comparing their income before and after WFTC.' Some citizens advice bureaux have seen clients who have been no better off after getting a job, finding childcare and coming off benefits. In some cases, what has been gained has been lost through the client forfeiting Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. According to Gingerbread, those who are particularly likely to find that the benefit of WFTC is marginal include: \u0095 homeowners with mortgages, who find that they lose the assistance they get to pay the mortgage; \u0095 tenants who have a high rent; \u0095 parents who pay very high childcare costs (so that even though WFTC can cover up to 70 per cent of the cost, the remaining 30 per cent can still be a substantial sum); \u0095 workers who find it difficult to get childcare and are using au pairs or other unregistered forms of care (WFTC applies only to childcare that is registered with the local authority's Social Services department); \u0095 workers with high travel costs. Several charities and other groups will perform a 'better off in work' calculation. These include Gingerbread, the National Council for One-Parent Families, your local citizens advice bureau (check your Yellow Pages or telephone 192), the welfare rights units of local authorities, some law centres and neighbourhood advice units. Many people may not appreciate the extent to which WFTC is more generous than Family Credit. Under the new system, maintenance income is disregarded in making the calculation. So, if you get \u00a350 maintenance a week, you can keep it all and will not lose any WFTC if you declare that income (under Family Credit, you would have been only \u00a315 better off a week). Benefits experts are lobbying the Government to take a broader view of what qualifies as registered childcare, ahead of a green paper expected this spring. Night-workers, for instance, often find it difficult to find a registered childminder at awkward hours, especially if they are lone parents, and so often fall back on family and friends.

      "body": "<p>Your computer could one day affect the size of your house. If you live in one of the 10 million households that have a PC, finding space for it could become as big an influence on your next choice of property as the number of children you have. </p> <p>Housing researchers are beginning to identify the rise of technology in the home as one of the driving influences behind demand for certain properties and, ultimately, on prices. </p> <p>Demand for homes with computer rooms and offices that enable people to work from home is set to soar, according to James Barlow, senior research fellow at Sussex University's Science Policy Research Unit, and author of a recent report on the future of housing for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. </p> <p>'I was in California a few months ago. Over there people expect there to be not only one home office but two, one for each partner, and they want homes to be cabled up to take a number of computers.' </p> <p>Although the scope to build new homes in the UK is limited by planning constraints and shortage of land, the demand for space to accommodate technology at home is likely to have an increasing bearing on prices in the second-hand market. </p> <p>In a research project Barlow is working on at present, involving interviews with 300 people looking for properties, one of the key themes is the search for space. 'A substantial minority are concerned about lack of space for home working.' </p> <p>Barlow, who conducted our interview on a mobile telephone, seated at a computer in his loft, says: 'All the evidence is that people want more space. 'The way people will use space in the home is changing. They will want rooms designed for home working, with access to the Internet.' </p> <p>He also predicts that we will spend increasing amounts of leisure time at home, as the Internet and other forms of technology provide activities and entertainment on the doorstep. </p> <p>So, does this mean the death of the three-bed semi, Britain's best-loved house? Not necessarily, says Barlow.

If you live in one of the 10 million households that have a PC, finding space for it could become as big an influence on your next choice of property as the number of children you have. Housing researchers are beginning to identify the rise of technology in the home as one of the driving influences behind demand for certain properties and, ultimately, on prices. Demand for homes with computer rooms and offices that enable people to work from home is set to soar, according to James Barlow, senior research fellow at Sussex University's Science Policy Research Unit, and author of a recent report on the future of housing for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. 'I was in California a few months ago. Over there people expect there to be not only one home office but two, one for each partner, and they want homes to be cabled up to take a number of computers.' Although the scope to build new homes in the UK is limited by planning constraints and shortage of land, the demand for space to accommodate technology at home is likely to have an increasing bearing on prices in the second-hand market. In a research project Barlow is working on at present, involving interviews with 300 people looking for properties, one of the key themes is the search for space. 'A substantial minority are concerned about lack of space for home working.' Barlow, who conducted our interview on a mobile telephone, seated at a computer in his loft, says: 'All the evidence is that people want more space. 'The way people will use space in the home is changing. They will want rooms designed for home working, with access to the Internet.' He also predicts that we will spend increasing amounts of leisure time at home, as the Internet and other forms of technology provide activities and entertainment on the doorstep. So, does this mean the death of the three-bed semi, Britain's best-loved house? Not necessarily, says Barlow. While there will certainly be more demand for larger properties, buyers will seek out properties that can be adapted by converting the roof space, for example, or building an extension over the garage. The desire to house home computers and create work space at home will, he says, be a bigger influence on demand for larger properties than the need to accommodate extended families - a factor some commentators have identified. Barlow says the jury is still out on whether we are ready to reinvent the extended family, inviting grandparents to live in as carers for children and, ultimately, to be cared for themselves. Richard Donnell, research analyst for estate agent Savills, says the quest for space may drive more people to buy homes outside the major city centres, but to have small second properties in the cities, particularly London. 'We could see a return to a strong market for the pied-\u00e0- terre, for people working at home but wanting somewhere to stay in London.' Donnell believes that developers will be reluctant to commit themselves to building larger properties because they usually make more money out of putting a larger number of smaller homes on one site. But Savills says builders should be thinking about features such as cabling for computers. Developers are already focusing on how to be more creative with living space, building in basements, lofts and rooms over garages. All this suggests that for the owners of larger properties, the four- or five-bedroom homes, the omens are good for the value of their investments. Increasingly, there may also be a better pay-back for money spent on loft conversions or extensions. In the past, such spending has not always raised the value of a property in proportion to the amount spent. Ian Perry, national housing spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, agrees: 'Conversions will be a better bet than in the past.' Andrew Spittle, of estate agent Robert Powell &amp; Co in Edgbaston, Birmingham, goes further: 'If you had, say, a big Victorian semi with four bedrooms and a loft worth \u00a3250,000, you could convert the loft for \u00a320,000, and I think it would probably push the value up to \u00a3300,000. 'To buy a five-bed house ion the same area you would probably have to pay nearly \u00a3350,000.' He points out that cellars may be suitable for conversion, too. 'There is demand for a decent-sized room for a home office, rather than just a little study. 'PCs take up quite a lot of space, and then there are all the peripherals. When we are designing homes with developers, we say that a study is an important room. It shouldn't just be a 6ft by 10ft thing.'

Another is that the new genre has art-historical precursors in big-name artists: Joseph Beuys, Salvador Dali, Christo, Lucio Fontana, Jim Dine all made unwearables as art. In the Fifties, Beuys began making men's suits from felt and animal fat: they can fetch around \u00a38,000 at auction.

Why clothing, instead of paint, or marble, or even formaldehyde? Artists have tumbled to the fact that the most intimate concepts of identity find expression in the thin layer that separates us from the outside world.

Others are vain and trifling. </p> <p>Among the conceptual clothing at Sotheby's will be work by Britain's leading exponent of the genre, Caroline Broadhead. Her signature work, titled 'Stress' (1993), is an empty translucent cotton dress bulging all over with foot-long carbon-fibre stiffeners. What she says about it exemplifies what artists expect of the new art form. </p> <p>'\"Stress\" expresses a woman's tension between inside and outside, private and public, between the self and the rest of the world.' The dress is, she says, trying to force itself back into shape. 'It is resisting the stress emanating from within, trying to conform to the shape expected of it.

The outrageous creations of Issey Miyake and Paco Rabanne seemed to be floating off the catwalk and into the realm of conceptual art. Artists took note. </p> <p>Paradoxically, now that artists have pushed the boundaries of conceptual clothing still further, the fashion industry is trying to catch up. Last month's haute couture shows in Paris offered the ultimate in the unwearable. The creations of John Galliano, which he describes as art, included a ballerina with her arm in a plaster-cast, lunatics in straitjackets and down-and-out costumes. </p> <p>Janice Blackburn, curator of Sotheby's show, famous for her annual Contemporary Decorative Arts selling exhibitions at Sotheby's, says: 'Nothing on that catwalk was accessible. It bore no relation to what people put on their backs.

She used to collect the sweepings from a hairdresser's salon in Glasgow. Her work juxtaposes the eroticism and repulsiveness of human hair, while her elegant but too-thin shapes hint at the constrictions of a notional femaleness dreamt up by male cou turiers.

      "body": "<p>If advocates of smart technology are to be believed, we will soon be able to throw away most of the cards cluttering our wallets and replace them with a single, personalised one, offering exactly the same functions. </p> <p>The card of the future could double as cash card, travel pass, electronic cash, video shop membership, electronic key and supermarket loyalty card. It could also store more detailed personal information, such as medical records. </p> <p>This new breed of plastic, known as the multiple application card, is in its infancy, but it could work across the entire range of existing card functions, as well as many new ones. Multiple application cards carry a 'smart' microchip, which can typically store around six A4 pages' worth of data; the magnetic stripes that now occupy the back of our cards store two lines of data. </p> <p>No wonder the banks are in the process of replacing every magnetic stripe on their cards with a microchip. These have the memory to store complex encryption codes enabling much greater protection from fraud. It still has enough left over to enable it to function in a range of applications. Experts say the absolute security the chip guarantees will make multiple-application cards particularly popular among Internet users, for whom fraud is a major deterrent to e-commerce. You can process information over the Internet by swiping the plastic through a reader connected to your PC. </p> <p>Big business is still working out how to best to exploit the smartcard's potential. Few projects have gone beyond the pilot stage. But the financial services and transport companies in particular, are keen to push their existing credit, debit, cash and travel cards as multiple-application cards, in part to justify the expense of implementing the costly microchips. The cost of smart chips ranges from 60p to \u00a311.00, compared with 4p-50p for magnetic stripes. Mondex, a consortium including HSBC, NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, is running trials on multiple-application cards at Nottingham and Exeter universities. </p> <p>These function as a stu dent card, a library card, an electronic key to campus buildings, a club membership card and e-cash. This allows smartcards to be loaded electronically with cash and used instead of money at participating shops. VisaCash, a competing initiative set up by Visa, is trying out a similar card at the University of Leeds. </p> <p>The first nationwide multiple-application smartcard will be launched in Manchester in the spring, backed by bus and train operator Stagecoach. This will eventually target 20 million UK travellers, operating initially as a travel pass and an electronic cash card which can be used at retailers, vending machines, parking meters and telephone boxes. Stagecoach is looking to add further applications as the card gathers momentum. </p> <p>Experts say that though there is clear demand for a universal smartcard, it could be a while before one emerges, even though the technology already exists. </p> <p>Richard Poynder, chairman of industry group the smartcard Club, says: 'Initially there will be a host of multiple-application smartcards using a range of different operating systems. This will defeat the object of having one card that does everything. But in time one or two cards will emerge as winners, and they will operate on a single operating system.' </p> <p>Poynder predicts that people will end up holding three or four multiple-application smartcards which correspond to different parts of their lives. A person may hold cards dedicated to lifestyle, payments, private details and, say, the weekend, says Poynder. </p> <p>'I think that trusted high street brands such as Vir gin and Boots will in time become the chief suppliers of branded smartcards rather than, say, the banks. But eventually I think we will see shops selling blank, unbranded cards off the shelf, which you go away and fill up with data from American Express, Visa or whoever.' </p> <p>Ultimately, the mobile phone could become the master multiple-application smartcard. Mobile phones already need a smart id card in order to function and are just begin ning to offer Internet access. It won't be long, for example, before you can access the Internet, find a book at an online bookshop and pay for it securely - all through your smart mobile. </p> <p>And with IT geeks dreaming up new mobile-phone applications on a daily basis, the potential to exploit the smartcard that powers the handset seems almost limitless. </p> <p>\u0095 Tom Bawden is a financial services reporter for Marketing Week</p>",

      "bodyText": "If advocates of smart technology are to be believed, we will soon be able to throw away most of the cards cluttering our wallets and replace them with a single, personalised one, offering exactly the same functions. The card of the future could double as cash card, travel pass, electronic cash, video shop membership, electronic key and supermarket loyalty card. It could also store more detailed personal information, such as medical records. This new breed of plastic, known as the multiple application card, is in its infancy, but it could work across the entire range of existing card functions, as well as many new ones. Multiple application cards carry a 'smart' microchip, which can typically store around six A4 pages' worth of data; the magnetic stripes that now occupy the back of our cards store two lines of data. No wonder the banks are in the process of replacing every magnetic stripe on their cards with a microchip. These have the memory to store complex encryption codes enabling much greater protection from fraud. It still has enough left over to enable it to function in a range of applications. Experts say the absolute security the chip guarantees will make multiple-application cards particularly popular among Internet users, for whom fraud is a major deterrent to e-commerce. You can process information over the Internet by swiping the plastic through a reader connected to your PC. Big business is still working out how to best to exploit the smartcard's potential. Few projects have gone beyond the pilot stage. But the financial services and transport companies in particular, are keen to push their existing credit, debit, cash and travel cards as multiple-application cards, in part to justify the expense of implementing the costly microchips. The cost of smart chips ranges from 60p to \u00a311.00, compared with 4p-50p for magnetic stripes. Mondex, a consortium including HSBC, NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, is running trials on multiple-application cards at Nottingham and Exeter universities. These function as a stu dent card, a library card, an electronic key to campus buildings, a club membership card and e-cash. This allows smartcards to be loaded electronically with cash and used instead of money at participating shops. VisaCash, a competing initiative set up by Visa, is trying out a similar card at the University of Leeds. The first nationwide multiple-application smartcard will be launched in Manchester in the spring, backed by bus and train operator Stagecoach. This will eventually target 20 million UK travellers, operating initially as a travel pass and an electronic cash card which can be used at retailers, vending machines, parking meters and telephone boxes. Stagecoach is looking to add further applications as the card gathers momentum. Experts say that though there is clear demand for a universal smartcard, it could be a while before one emerges, even though the technology already exists. Richard Poynder, chairman of industry group the smartcard Club, says: 'Initially there will be a host of multiple-application smartcards using a range of different operating systems. This will defeat the object of having one card that does everything. But in time one or two cards will emerge as winners, and they will operate on a single operating system.' Poynder predicts that people will end up holding three or four multiple-application smartcards which correspond to different parts of their lives. A person may hold cards dedicated to lifestyle, payments, private details and, say, the weekend, says Poynder. 'I think that trusted high street brands such as Vir gin and Boots will in time become the chief suppliers of branded smartcards rather than, say, the banks. But eventually I think we will see shops selling blank, unbranded cards off the shelf, which you go away and fill up with data from American Express, Visa or whoever.' Ultimately, the mobile phone could become the master multiple-application smartcard. Mobile phones already need a smart id card in order to function and are just begin ning to offer Internet access. It won't be long, for example, before you can access the Internet, find a book at an online bookshop and pay for it securely - all through your smart mobile. And with IT geeks dreaming up new mobile-phone applications on a daily basis, the potential to exploit the smartcard that powers the handset seems almost limitless. \u0095 Tom Bawden is a financial services reporter for Marketing Week",

      "body": "<p>Which is riskier - to have 10 per cent of your savings in the shares of just one company, or to miss out on the excitement of the latest investment fad? </p> <p>The question is becoming pertinent as mega-mergers and technology fever create corporate titans. Already, BP Amoco accounts for almost 9 per cent of the FT All-Share index, and Vodafone 7 per cent. The two are on course to account for 20 per cent following Vodafone's takeover of Mannesmann and BP Amoco's planned deal with Arco. </p> <p>Add a combined GlaxoWellcome and SmithKline Beecham, and just three companies would represent a quarter of the market, and close to a third of the FTSE 100 Index. Individual companies have dominated the index in the past - BP represented 9 per cent of the All-Share in 1979 - but the emergence of a few giants is unprecedented. </p> <p>Does this matter? It depends on who you talk to. Some investment experts, such as Standard Life and independent adviser Best Investment, say the concentration means supposedly low risk funds designed to track the index have become very risky. An unexpected disaster at BP or a shift in sentiment about the future of telephony could cause huge swings in the indices, and thus in the price of funds tracking them. </p> <p>The problem is exacerbated by the fact that some of the most fashionable shares, such as ARM Holdings or Energis, have only a limited proportion of their share capital available to the public. Tracker funds have to scramble to buy the few shares available, or invest in similar rivals as a proxy, which push prices up further. Standard Life is concerned that this has driven some shares to extreme, unsustainable, valuations. </p> <p>Those who run trackers, such as Legal &amp; General or Scottish Widows, say the risk is in being out of these companies. They will be a big part of an investors' portfolio but they are also a big part of the market. It is less risky to have 10 per cent of your funds in something representing 10 per cent of the market than to have 10 per cent of your funds in something which is just 1 per cent of the market - as some actively managed funds do. </p> <p>For the past few years, the trackers have had the best of the argument.

      "bodyText": "Which is riskier - to have 10 per cent of your savings in the shares of just one company, or to miss out on the excitement of the latest investment fad? The question is becoming pertinent as mega-mergers and technology fever create corporate titans. Already, BP Amoco accounts for almost 9 per cent of the FT All-Share index, and Vodafone 7 per cent. The two are on course to account for 20 per cent following Vodafone's takeover of Mannesmann and BP Amoco's planned deal with Arco. Add a combined GlaxoWellcome and SmithKline Beecham, and just three companies would represent a quarter of the market, and close to a third of the FTSE 100 Index. Individual companies have dominated the index in the past - BP represented 9 per cent of the All-Share in 1979 - but the emergence of a few giants is unprecedented. Does this matter? It depends on who you talk to. Some investment experts, such as Standard Life and independent adviser Best Investment, say the concentration means supposedly low risk funds designed to track the index have become very risky. An unexpected disaster at BP or a shift in sentiment about the future of telephony could cause huge swings in the indices, and thus in the price of funds tracking them. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that some of the most fashionable shares, such as ARM Holdings or Energis, have only a limited proportion of their share capital available to the public. Tracker funds have to scramble to buy the few shares available, or invest in similar rivals as a proxy, which push prices up further. Standard Life is concerned that this has driven some shares to extreme, unsustainable, valuations. Those who run trackers, such as Legal &amp; General or Scottish Widows, say the risk is in being out of these companies. They will be a big part of an investors' portfolio but they are also a big part of the market. It is less risky to have 10 per cent of your funds in something representing 10 per cent of the market than to have 10 per cent of your funds in something which is just 1 per cent of the market - as some actively managed funds do. For the past few years, the trackers have had the best of the argument. The large and fashionable have powered ahead and the rest have been left far behind - L &amp; G calculated that the top quarter of the FTSE 100 rose by 28 per cent last year while the bottom quarter fell by 33 per cent. Trackers, whose performance should be around average, have been appearing at the top of the league tables while active managers have done badly. If Standard Life is right that the current valuations are unsustainable, that could reverse as prices of some of the fashionable stocks fall. For investors, there is really only one lesson in this debate: investing in the stock market, through trackers or through actively managed funds, is always risky.",

'We had been providing a helper two hours a week so he can go shopping. When I saw him recently I asked if there was any other help he wanted,' says Slamon.

The Bill, expected to be law by the end of the year, will make it easier for the country's 6 million carers to get support. According to the Department of Health, help could include 'home helps, fares, and mobile phones or pagers to help them stay in touch'. </p> <p>The motives are not just altruistic, says Slamon: 'A lot of carers become patients: their own health deteriorates. But the more help you can give them, even in small ways, the longer they can provide that care.

At the moment, the carer cannot get an assessment unless the person they are looking after wants one.

Although he maintained a reticent dignity, friends say he was quietly angry. </p> <p>Ruddock, a former Sunday Times executive, acquired many friends and admirers because of his gentle nature and fair-minded, reflective journalism. </p> <p>Many among those who said goodbye to him on Thursday were convinced that he was paying the price for the failure of his boss, Andrew Neil, former editor of the Sunday Times and now the grandiosely styled 'publisher' of Scotsman Publications, owned by the Barclay twins. </p> <p>Friends say the two men have barely spoken to each other for a month. Some go further and assert that Neil, whatever his qualities as a journalist and editor, was a manager who ruled by fear and dogma. He may have lost patience with Ruddock because the Irishman, for all his gentleness, has a stubborn streak and refused to yield on central strategic questions. </p> <p>The changes announced by Neil last week compounded the uncertainty surrounding the title by saying that although the appointment of Tim Luckhurst, Ruddock's deputy, as editor was provisional he 'hoped' to make it permanent. Luckhurst, with relatively little newspaper experience, is evidently on trial. </p> <p>The developing estrangement between Ruddock and Neil came to a head in January, when sales figures for December became available. They showed that the Scotsman , which sold almost 100,000 in 1979, was down to 72,000 for the month and 78,000 for the year, a decline of 3.5 per cent against a market fall of 1.5 per cent. </p> <p>Neil's critics point in particular to his failure until recently to make any significant investment in sales and marketing. Other titles in the house - the Evening News and Scotland on Sunday - are also underperforming a slowly declining market. </p> <p>Editorially an insider said: 'Andrew Neil is the problem. He appears to loathe his own country.' Under the first years of his leadership, when he was editor-in-chief, the paper took a shift to the right and acquired a sometimes rabid and even vicious tone. Neil is an anguished Unionist who hated devolution, and the paper has sent out confusing signals about the new Scottish parliament, an institution of which Edinburgh wants to be proud. </p> <p>It reviled core elements in the Scotsman's readership - notably teachers, of whom there are 50,000 in Scotland. A senior staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: 'I meet too many teachers, and lawyers and social workers who have stopped reading the Scotsman .' </p> <p>But friends of Ruddock say this perception no longer chimes with reality and is essentially a legacy of the brilliant but wayward Martin Clarke's tenure of as editor's in 1997 and 1998. Conflict about the paper's strategic mission led to Ruddock's departure. He wanted to build it over the years into a national and international paper for Scotland - an Irish Times for Scotland, a friend said, but 'not so boring'. Neil is said to want the paper to be like the New York Times - a paper for the city and the world. </p> <p>Critics say that the Scotsman , in lifting its eyes to wider horizons, neglected its own back yard. A competitor said: 'The Scotsman's agenda has been sub- Daily Mail , even sub- Evening Standard , dominated by metropolitan values. If you wanted to keep up to date with Edinburgh issues, you'd look in vain.' </p> <p>Like many an editor before him who had a pan-Scottish vision, Ruddock was confronted by the essentially regional nature of the Scottish morning press. Among the broadsheets the Scotsman and the Herald circulate throughout Scotland but are rooted in their cities. The Herald, like the Press &amp; Journal in Aberdeen and the Courier in Dundee, have continued to nourish their roots and fared better. </p> <p>Under Clarke, now editor of the struggling Daily Record in Glasgow, the Scotsman infamously spent \u00a31 million on a Glasgow campaign that produced an extra sale of 300 copies. Clarke's legacy to the paper was not only the rebarbative tone which it has been trying to live down but, insiders say, a \u00a31m editorial budget deficit. </p> <p>A colleague said: 'Clarke was groomed on the Daily Mail and is a brilliant newsman. But he has no political sophistication. He is a streetfighter who gets caught up in a perpetual series of brawls.' </p> <p>Competitors note that the Record under Clarke is sometimes brilliant but uneven - a reflection, they believe, of Clarke's own character. He has mounted a vociferous campaign against the repeal of Section 28 in particular and the Scottish Executive in general. First Minister Donald Dewar is portrayed as a fumbling Dad's Army character. </p> <p>This sundering of the Record's close and amicable relationship with Labour not only reflects Clarke's right-wing instincts but also his alarm at the rise in sales of the Sun , which flirts with the SNP, and the inexorable decline of the Record , which only a few years ago sold more than 700,000 copies a day. </p> <p>Neil, it is said, is now determined to press on with his new vision for the Scotsman . An incipient 'metro page' last Monday was the first sign of the impending change of emphasis. Ruddock declined to embrace this new approach, which is to be the theme of the paper's relaunch in the spring. </p> <p>Compared with the metro section of the New York Times , with its powerful newsroom and team of writers, the metro concept is a puny presence in a paper which in the past seamlessly stitched together its various areas of interest. It was, after all, founded in 1817 specifically as a vehicle to protest against conditions in the local infirmary. </p> <p>The Barclay brothers have poured millions into the Scotsman . Last month the company moved into 'palatial' new offices near the parliament site at Holyrood. </p> <p>Now, insiders say the brothers are worried that their investment is producing no return, only mounting costs and falling market share.

      "body": "<p>Shareholders in NatWest, drowning under piles of offer and defence documents, must be desperate for the close of the bid on 14 February. Their irritation is as nothing compared with Bank of Scotland's. Had the issue been settled on 24 September, when it launched its bid for NatWest, it would have romped home with the prize. </p> <p>But competition investigations and a late entry by Edinburgh rival Royal Bank of Scotland stretched the already long 60-day bid timetable to an agonising 144 days. That has given all three parties so much time for claim and counter-claim, posturing and muck-spreading that the issues are in danger of becoming obscured. So, it is worth going back to where we stood before Bank of Scotland made its surprise bid four months ago. </p> <p>Then, NatWest had a well-earned reputation as Britain's worst bank. For years, its managers had embarked on a series of ambitious strategies - build a US banking network, create a top five investment bank, establish itself as a leading fund manager - which quickly unraveled. The result was a dismal record of falling profits and the destruction of billions of pounds of shareholder value. </p> <p>The final straw for investors was the agreed merger with Legal &amp; General. NatWest had agreed to pay an inflated price for the insurer, to test the concept of bancassurance - always viewed with great scepticism in Britain - and to get its much admired chief executive onto its board. </p> <p>The result was bang in line with NatWest's record. More than \u00a33 billion was wiped off its market value, and unhappy shareholders were threatening a revolt. That was the catalyst for the Bank of Scotland bid. Nineteen weeks on, the positions of both parties have changed dramatically. </p> <p>NatWest has made a remarkable recovery, and its defence is seen as sufficiently creditable to give it a chance of escaping the clutches of the two Scottish banks. </p> <p>Bank of Scotland, on the other hand, has run a lacklustre campaign. Few would dispute its excellent record, but it has failed to convince the City that it can use that record to transform NatWest. </p> <p>Royal Bank made the most of its late entrance and seemed the more dynamic. However, it has said nothing of substance since it launched the bid, relying on creating an aura of a dynamic, international bank without producing the evidence to support it. </p> <p>As the battle enters its final week, it is worth examining the position of the three players. NatWest's defence has been built on three planks. First, and most important, it has installed a new management team - it was clearly impossible to conduct a decent defence with Derek Wanless as chief executive. In his place, Sir David brought in Ron Sandler, who helped him push through the restructuring of the Lloyd's insurance market. That was followed with the recruitment of Gordon Pell, from Lloyds TSB, to head the UK retail bank. </p> <p>Second, it has drawn the City's attention to the fact that, for all the grandiose claims by bidders, the risks of mergers and takeovers are high. A table in its final defence document analysing 10 bank mergers in the US, is telling. All of them failed to meet the profit target implicit in the promise of synergy benefits, and eight of the 10 have underperformed the relevant bank index since the merger. </p> <p>Third, it has promised more cost cuts and bigger job losses - 15,000 people are to go and 525 million is to be saved. Last week, it said that, had these savings been achieved last year, pro-forma profits of the new NatWest - that is after disposals - would have been \u00a32.3bn, compared with the \u00a31.8bn actually reported. </p> <p>Then, it is promising to increase revenue. Unlike the Scottish banks, NatWest has not tied itself to a target. Instead, it points out that, if it matched the average of its top six competitors, it would add \u00a3217m of income. If it emulated the best performer, that would rise to \u00a3612m. </p> <p>Any of NatWest's shareholders could have told the bank that its problems stem from its inability to generate income and control costs. Whether shareholders should believe NatWest's promise that it will be different this time depends on their opinion of the new management team. </p> <p>Sir David has certainly been an impressive general, but his record before the bid was hardly impressive. It was clear when he became chairman last April that Wanless was not up to the job as chief executive. But Sir David kept him on, although his role would have been reduced if the L &amp; G deal had gone ahead. </p> <p>As damaging was the L &amp; G deal itself. That was Sir David's idea, and it has been universally slated. It may, as some suggest, have been a way of sidelining Wanless and attracting a talented boss for the bank. How much easier it would have been to sack him and employ headhunters. </p> <p>Sandler has been much less prominent during the bid - he has, apparently, been too busy running the bank. Analysts complain that he is not a banker - but Wanless was and that did not help him. More telling is his lack of experience in industry: saving Lloyd's from angry names is an impressive accomplishment but it is not the same as running a clearing bank. </p> <p>Some suggest that, even if NatWest keeps its independence, Sandler's appointment will end soon after the bid, and Pell will replace him. </p> <p>On the face of it, Pell would be better suited to the job. He is a banker and Lloyds TSB is the City's favourite bank, with an impressive record of revenue generation and tight cost control. The problem is, everyone attributes that to chairman Sir Brian Pitman - even chief executive Peter Ellwood does not get a look-in. Pell may be able to transfer some of LloydsTSB's magic to NatWest, but we will not know for certain until long after the two Scots bidders have disappeared. </p> <p>NatWest's real trump card is its warning about the risks of mergers. There have been enough learned studies of the subject to show that the majority of mergers do not live up to their promise, but investors are too often happy to ignore the evidence and vote with the acquiror. The Scottish banks have failed to answer this point other than to say that the quality of their management means this time it will be different. </p> <p>How good, then, are the management teams? Neither has been involved in a deal anywhere near the size of this one, so their ability to integrate a business twice their size has not been tested. </p> <p>Royal Bank claims that BoS is simply a Scottish bank with some efficient methods of winning business in England while it is more of a financial conglomerate, with interests in everything from train leasing to US banking and insurance. It even claims a European business, although this is limited to having BSCH as its main shareholder. </p> <p>It acknowledges that BoS is more efficient but says this is because BoS has no English branches and a different business mix. And it points out that while BoS has a very low cost-income ratio - the measure of banking efficiency - it has stayed that way for years while Royal has been getting more efficient. </p> <p>It points to its success in with Citizens, through 17 acquisitions in eight years, as well as recent deals such as Green Flag and Angel Trains. </p> <p>Bank of Scotland's acquisition record is even less extensive. It bought and rather quickly sold a business in New Zealand and looks set to do the same with BankWest in Australia. It points out that neither deal has lost it money, but that hardly enhances its reputation for acquisitions. </p> <p>Bank of Scotland's case rests on its record of expanding its own income while keeping costs in check. Its performance has been impressive. But its plans for exporting those skills to NatWest came across as muddled. Its strategy is to make NatWest's branches smaller, friendlier and more effective for selling products. But it has failed to convince. </p> <p>Of NatWest's 1,700 branches, only 274 will be left unchanged. Of the remainder, more than half will be modernised, 523 will be moved elsewhere, 36 will close and a further 125 will be opened to fill gaps in the network. </p> <p>It has already carried out this exercise with its own network and says that it results in an average increase in revenue of 18 per cent. It has used a more conservative estimate of 10 per cent to calculate the extra income it can generate. </p> <p>However, there is no guarantee that it will keep its existing customers, let alone attract enough new ones to meet its revenue targets. </p> <p>Royal's revenue claims are no more certain, relying largely on cross-selling products from within the retail and corporate banking business and from the Direct Line insurance operation. </p> <p>BoS, Royal and NatWest would need at least a year to demonstrate how well or badly they can fulfil their promises. Shareholders do not have that long. They have to decide this week. NatWest is coming under increasing pressure to recommend one or other bid, but it is in no better a position to judge than its shareholders. Without that guidance, it is impossible to judge which way the battle will go.</p>",

Given the nature of the world's largest hostile corporate takeover - an epic on the scale of Dallas crossed with England's 1966 World Cup victory - it was an anticlimax. </p> <p>As Vodafone chief executive Chris Gent walked into Mannesmann's D\u00fcsseldorf HQ that night, he could reflect that he was close to making history. No German company had ever fallen to a hostile takeover by a foreign rival. </p> <p>The effects of what Gent was doing would resonate around the business world and high up in the political stratosphere. Even German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der had publicly supported Mannesmann's independence when he said hostile bids destroyed the culture of companies. </p> <p>And the fact that Vodafone's prey was Germany's second-largest company, with more than 116,000 employees, and a symbol of the country's industrial heritage made the deal more incredible. </p> <p>Founded in 1885, Mannesmann started by making steel tubes, and diversified into a number of industries, including chemicals, electronics, and, crucially for Vodafone, telecoms. Its place in German industrial folklore dwarfed that of BMW or Volkswagen. </p> <p>It was dark when Gent walked into the massive building beside the Rhine to talk to his counterpart Klaus Esser. Few people were around. Esser's office is on the twenty-first floor of the elegant Twenties building, which dominates the skyline. 'Hello Klaus, nice to see you,' Gent said. As they shook hands and started to talk they could see industrial barges on the river below, symbols of Germany's industrial heritage. </p> <p>Several of Gent's key advisers from Goldman Sachs and Warburg Dillon Read had already been in the building for hours. Mannesmann's advisers, who had plotted through the previous night, sustained by takeaways of Westphalian chicken and potatoes, were cordial in their greetings. 'The negotiations we had were very courteous and professional. Klaus has a good sense of humour and we get on well,' Gent told journalists. </p> <p>Esser had phoned him the previous day inviting him to the Mannesmann fortress to discuss terms. The deal values the combined company at around \u00a3228 billion, fractionally ahead of the value of AOL's merger with Time Warner. Negotiations between Vodafone and Mannesmann advisers reopened at the start of last week following three weeks' silence. </p> <p>These talks went on until early on Thursday morning and resumed the following day, although some advisers worked all night. Gent himself left the talks to appear on a German television show. He spoke from a small room in the Steigenberger Parkhotel, which was his base. Gent drummed home his belief in the deal's logic, as his advisers thrashed out its framework. </p> <p>Mannesmann's supervisory board met last Thursday afternoon to discuss the terms, but took no decision. Esser assured Gent that the board would ratify the deal the following day. </p> <p>Insiders say the main terms were fleshed out almost immediately. The stumbling blocks were minor. One demand was for the Mannesmann name still to be used in Germany; they also worried about how their company's surrender was to be painted. They were keen to highlight Esser's success in securing a much higher price for shareholders than Vodafone had originally offered. As one Mannesmann supporter claimed: 'Esser has created an extra \u20ac11.5 billion (about \u00a39bn) in three months. That's not bad going.' </p> <p>When Vodafone made its original offer just before Christmas, Mannesmann was valued at around \u00a384bn. By the time Esser agreed terms, the value of the all-paper offer had risen to \u00a3113bn. Mannesmann's value had risen from \u20ac154 a share to \u20ac353 a share. </p> <p>As the minutiae were picked over throughout the following day, Gent left the Mannesmann HQ to visit its Eurokom subsidiary. Throughout Thursday the international press gathered outside the HQ, and his every move was beamed around the world. 'It was like a journalists' Woodstock out there,' said one insider. As Gent stooped to get into a waiting car he paused and, with understated hubris, told the press pack: 'It's nice to be in D\u00fcsseldorf.' </p> <p>Considering the roller-coaster nature of the campaign, there may have been times when Gent considered this visit to Germany unlikely, times when Mannesmann looked like slipping out of his grasp. Earlier this year speculation about a Mannesmann merger with the French utility giant Vivendi had threatened to spoil the Vodafone party. But Gent had acted quickly to break up the potential marriage. Within days Vodafone had teamed up with Vivendi to create an Internet portal, killing Esser's hopes of a white knight defence. </p> <p>By the start of this month, Esser knew the game was up. His main advisers at Morgan Stanley continued to argue the case for holding out until the last minute of the Vodafone offer period, which would have closed tomorrow. But he came under mounting pressure to cede a deal. As the value of the takeover continued to rise, so did the chances of a lawsuit from disgruntled shareholders if the German boss continued to hold out. As Vodafone agreed to increase its offer marginally, giving Mannesmann's shareholders 49.5 per cent of the company, compared with the original 47.2 per cent, Esser was able to retain a degree of satisfaction at the outcome. </p> <p>Indeed the whole nature of the takeover campaign could provide a textbook example of the rules of corporate conduct in the future. Gent said: 'It's been a long run, but it's been a pretty friendly hostile takeover.' </p> <p>However, the relationship between Esser and Gent is damaged. Esser will be an executive director of the new company only until the summer. His main brief will be to oversee the disposal of Mannesmann's engineering and automotive divisions, a task he was to carry out even before the Vodafone deal. After that Esser will switch to being a non-executive deputy chairman; there are doubts over how long he will stay. </p> <p>The relationship between the two men reached rock bottom early in January when cricket-mad Gent, who was watching England play a Test match against South Africa, mocked his counterpart's love of poetry and chess in preference to sport. Gent's advisers say he was horrified to see the off-the-record remarks in print. However they exemplify Gent's cocksure attitude to the deal. 'We wouldn't have attempted this if we weren't certain that we were going to get a majority,' he said repeatedly. </p> <p>But for three crucial days last autumn Vodafone's future hung in the balance. Gent was at a conference retreat, Brocket Hall in Welwyn Garden City, when he heard that Mannesmann was negotiating to buy UK rival Orange. The Vodafone chief head had gathered all the heads of his company's global subsidiaries to hear his strategy for creating an Internet platform to link them together. Mannesmann, Gent had always felt, would eventually end up as part of Vodafone. The Orange link-up changed everything. </p> <p>For three days Gent and his advisers crunched the numbers. Could Vodafone pull off such an audacious coup, one which would eventually make it the world's fourth-largest company after Microsoft, General Electric and Cisco Systems? The eventual decision to launch the bid evolved from a feeling that if Vodafone didn't attempt the impossible it would end up being swallowed by a US predator. For Gent, who had been with Vodafone since 1985, this was unthinkable. </p> <p>But as he and his army of advisers, who have earned around \u00a3400m in fees for their work, toasted their success last Friday night, the enormity of what they had achieved had only just begun to sink in. Perhaps Gent will be mindful of the present given to Olivetti chief executive Roberto Colaninno following his firm's acquisition of Telecom Italia. It was a construction worker's belt, complete with a hammer, wire cutters and a screwdriver. The point is that the hardest work - transforming the new company from a business which allows people to talk into one which offers them a wealth of new media services - starts now. On Friday a cheerful Gent said: 'My diary is filled up with people who want to do deals with us.' </p> <p>To the victor, the spoils. </p> <p><strong>It was good to talk</strong></p> <p>IT WAS a tale of two companies. The grinning face of Vodafone boss Chris Gent on the financial pages last Friday contrasted with the pensive mugshot of BT chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield the day before. In the same week that Vodafone had just completed the world's largest merger, BT shocked the City with interim results at the bottom of expectations. It unveiled plans to axe 3,000 jobs - the latest in a long line of cutbacks. Over the past decade BT has cut its workforce from 245,000 to 137,000. </p> <p>Vodafone, meanwhile, has moved at breakneck speed securing alliances (Vivendi last week), concluding mergers (AirTouch and Bell Atlantic in the US last year) as well as taking stakes in numerous subsidiaries around Europe and the Far East in a bid to become a global player. It has also been quicker and more forceful in communicating its Internet strategy. All of which has helped drive the value of Vodafone's stock north at a galloping pace, giving the company the firepower to do mega-deals. </p> <p>BT, meanwhile, is viewed as slow to embrace new technologies. Once it could have been forgiven for not focusing too much on the Internet. After all, its core fixed-wire voice telephone business in the UK was a fantastic earner. But there is much more competition around now, not to mention intervention by watchdog Oftel to keep the costs down. These factors mean BT's staple source of income is under threat, hence the need to embrace new technologies and services, chiefly mobile telephony and the Internet, which will create new earnings streams. Its mobile arm, BT Cellnet, gets the thumbs-up from analysts, but it doesn't have anything like the global reach of a combined Vodafone/Mannesmann. After all, if telecoms is about anything now it's about providing seamless global communication links. </p> <p>And while other operators have embraced the Internet with gusto, the jury's still out on BT. The problem is, of course, that as this credibility gap widens the value of BT's stock plummets, limiting its ability to do deals. The conventional wisdom is that it needs a merger, and fast. It held exploratory talks with Telef\u00f3nica late last year, but these fell through. Merger plans with both Cable &amp;Wireless and MCI fell through in 1996. 'BT is cheaper than the sum of its parts,' said Paul Sharma, analyst with JP Morgan. Indeed, BT's share price has risen by only 154 per cent over the past decade, compared with Vodafone's 845 per cent. The question now is: how long before a predator turns on BT? </p> <p><strong> Jamie Doward and Ben Laurance</strong></p>",

But he came under mounting pressure to cede a deal. As the value of the takeover continued to rise, so did the chances of a lawsuit from disgruntled shareholders if the German boss continued to hold out. As Vodafone agreed to increase its offer marginally, giving Mannesmann's shareholders 49.5 per cent of the company, compared with the original 47.2 per cent, Esser was able to retain a degree of satisfaction at the outcome. Indeed the whole nature of the takeover campaign could provide a textbook example of the rules of corporate conduct in the future. Gent said: 'It's been a long run, but it's been a pretty friendly hostile takeover.' However, the relationship between Esser and Gent is damaged. Esser will be an executive director of the new company only until the summer. His main brief will be to oversee the disposal of Mannesmann's engineering and automotive divisions, a task he was to carry out even before the Vodafone deal. After that Esser will switch to being a non-executive deputy chairman; there are doubts over how long he will stay. The relationship between the two men reached rock bottom early in January when cricket-mad Gent, who was watching England play a Test match against South Africa, mocked his counterpart's love of poetry and chess in preference to sport. Gent's advisers say he was horrified to see the off-the-record remarks in print. However they exemplify Gent's cocksure attitude to the deal. 'We wouldn't have attempted this if we weren't certain that we were going to get a majority,' he said repeatedly. But for three crucial days last autumn Vodafone's future hung in the balance. Gent was at a conference retreat, Brocket Hall in Welwyn Garden City, when he heard that Mannesmann was negotiating to buy UK rival Orange. The Vodafone chief head had gathered all the heads of his company's global subsidiaries to hear his strategy for creating an Internet platform to link them together. Mannesmann, Gent had always felt, would eventually end up as part of Vodafone. The Orange link-up changed everything. For three days Gent and his advisers crunched the numbers. Could Vodafone pull off such an audacious coup, one which would eventually make it the world's fourth-largest company after Microsoft, General Electric and Cisco Systems? The eventual decision to launch the bid evolved from a feeling that if Vodafone didn't attempt the impossible it would end up being swallowed by a US predator. For Gent, who had been with Vodafone since 1985, this was unthinkable. But as he and his army of advisers, who have earned around \u00a3400m in fees for their work, toasted their success last Friday night, the enormity of what they had achieved had only just begun to sink in. Perhaps Gent will be mindful of the present given to Olivetti chief executive Roberto Colaninno following his firm's acquisition of Telecom Italia. It was a construction worker's belt, complete with a hammer, wire cutters and a screwdriver. The point is that the hardest work - transforming the new company from a business which allows people to talk into one which offers them a wealth of new media services - starts now. On Friday a cheerful Gent said: 'My diary is filled up with people who want to do deals with us.' To the victor, the spoils. It was good to talk IT WAS a tale of two companies. The grinning face of Vodafone boss Chris Gent on the financial pages last Friday contrasted with the pensive mugshot of BT chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield the day before. In the same week that Vodafone had just completed the world's largest merger, BT shocked the City with interim results at the bottom of expectations. It unveiled plans to axe 3,000 jobs - the latest in a long line of cutbacks. Over the past decade BT has cut its workforce from 245,000 to 137,000. Vodafone, meanwhile, has moved at breakneck speed securing alliances (Vivendi last week), concluding mergers (AirTouch and Bell Atlantic in the US last year) as well as taking stakes in numerous subsidiaries around Europe and the Far East in a bid to become a global player. It has also been quicker and more forceful in communicating its Internet strategy. All of which has helped drive the value of Vodafone's stock north at a galloping pace, giving the company the firepower to do mega-deals. BT, meanwhile, is viewed as slow to embrace new technologies. Once it could have been forgiven for not focusing too much on the Internet. After all, its core fixed-wire voice telephone business in the UK was a fantastic earner. But there is much more competition around now, not to mention intervention by watchdog Oftel to keep the costs down. These factors mean BT's staple source of income is under threat, hence the need to embrace new technologies and services, chiefly mobile telephony and the Internet, which will create new earnings streams. Its mobile arm, BT Cellnet, gets the thumbs-up from analysts, but it doesn't have anything like the global reach of a combined Vodafone/Mannesmann. After all, if telecoms is about anything now it's about providing seamless global communication links. And while other operators have embraced the Internet with gusto, the jury's still out on BT. The problem is, of course, that as this credibility gap widens the value of BT's stock plummets, limiting its ability to do deals. The conventional wisdom is that it needs a merger, and fast. It held exploratory talks with Telef\u00f3nica late last year, but these fell through. Merger plans with both Cable &amp;Wireless and MCI fell through in 1996. 'BT is cheaper than the sum of its parts,' said Paul Sharma, analyst with JP Morgan. Indeed, BT's share price has risen by only 154 per cent over the past decade, compared with Vodafone's 845 per cent. The question now is: how long before a predator turns on BT?

The Scottish banks are both small and face a real challenge integrating a bank of NatWest's size. Both have proved adept at using their Scottish base as a platform to expand their business elsewhere, but the skills required to do that are very different from the skills needed to turn around and run a bank of NatWest's size. Their history of organic growth bolstered by small acquisitions means that neither can claim to have more such skills than the other. Both banks say that it is not their staff but NatWest's which will turn the bank around. Their faith is touching, but it may be seriously misplaced. Years of poor management, chaotic systems and underperformance have sapped morale and sent the brightest stars looking for challenges elsewhere. NatWest's decision to accelerate redundancies as part of its defence will not have helped. That is one of the reasons why NatWest should not keep its independence. Its workforce has been so badly shaken by this bid that it needs an outside catalyst, like a new owner, to recover. NatWest's management may have put up a good defence, but they are untested at running a clearing bank, let alone turning it around. Managements at the two Scottish banks, by contrast, have at least demonstrated that they can run a banking business - and well. That gives them the edge over Sir David Rowland and his team. The Royal Bank of Scotland is hungriest for a deal. It made overtures to Barclays, Birmingham Midshires and Halifax before launching this bid. Its campaign has been far slicker than that run by Bank of Scotland, which seemed to find the whole business of explaining itself an irritation. But Bank of Scotland is simply a better retail bank than the Royal. It is the banking business of NatWest that needs fixing. BoS, with its superior record of income generation and cost control, is the best placed to fix that. Peter Burt and his team must just pray that it does not cost them their reputation.",

I had convinced the editor I needed a wad of dosh to maintain my cover as a grasping yuppie. But my mark, a young New Labour lobbyist, was in no mood for good vintage. 'It's appalling,' he moaned, head in hands. He was horrified that competitors, former aides of Messrs Blair, Brown and Mandelson, had passed confidential Government information to me and to their clients, US power companies. </p> <p>The Americans, who owned seven of England's 12 regional electricity companies, and their British comrades in water, gas and telecoms, were concerned about the new Government's tough plans to end the windfall profits and fat-cat pay-outs that marked the Tories' befuddled regulation of utilities. That was June 1998. Last week, the feared reform plan, the Utility Bill, debuted in the Commons. </p> <p>In Opposition, Labour had no shortage of tales to tell of Tory regulation buffoonery. In 1994, Ofwat director Ian Byatt authorised water companies to collect \u00a33 billion a year that the utilities claimed they needed to maintain the nation's rotting pipe network. The companies duly collected the repair surcharge - then diverted the cash to pay dividends and bonuses. In this past year alone, underspending on operations hit \u00a3420 million. </p> <p>Rather than thunder at the companies for 'gaming' (the industry's term for fiddling the system), Byatt poured praise on them for maintaining the system at a lower-than-expected cost. As their just reward, Byatt let shareholders keep what he oddly called 'efficiency gains'. But the companies did not maintain the system, they merely dumped workers off the payroll. Meanwhile, nearly a third of the nation's water simply bleeds out of leaky pipes. </p> <p>Over the 10 years of Byatt's watch, the amount of money shifted from operations and upgrades to shareholders easily topped \u00a34bn. Operating profits now eat up an eye-popping 45p out of each pound charged on a water and sewer bill. 'We're still on the learning curve,' says Byatt. The public has spent quite a lot on his education. </p> <p>Byatt was not alone in his amateur act. In 1996, when the electricity regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild was asked how he distinguished capital expenditures from operating expenditures, he replied: 'Does it make a difference?' Answer: Only to the customers who pay the bill for his loosey-goosey accounting rules. </p> <p>The basis of Keystone Kops regulation is the strange, cabbalistic system of price setting Professor Littlechild designed for Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>Regulators determine prices in secretive, closed hugger-mugger with utility chiefs and their accountants. Consumers are barred from looking at company accounts. If the regulator, a virtual hostage to industry data, fails to do the utilities' bidding, companies may appeal to the Competition Commission. But consumers have no right to appeal against higher prices. Shareholders get the gold mine, customers get the shaft. </p> <p>Labour promised radical change. In its Utility Bill, the Government does not back away from its commitment. It performs a complete flip. Consumers' right to appeal? Forget it. And if a customer wants to eavesdrop on meetings of the regulator and regulated? Scram, Sam. </p> <p>To give the bill a little PR panache, the Government gives the organisation a spin. Out go the single regulators, in come panels. To watch over each new Regulatory Panel, hand-picked by the Department of Trade &amp; Industry Minister, the Government will set up a Consumer Panel, also picked by the Minister. </p> <p>What if real live bill-paying consumers want to look at the utility accounts seen by either the Tweedle-Dee panel or the Tweedle-Dum panel? 'That,' sniffed a DTI spokesman, 'will be taken care of under Mr Straw's Freedom of Information Bill.' </p> <p>Indeed it will. The proposed FOI Act bars regulatory agencies from releasing information given to them, 'in confidence' or which may be 'commercially sensitive' or which 'may affect share prices'. In the utility regulation game, that's just about everything. </p> <p>In case some information leaks through, the Bill provides for the Minister to issue a blacklist of additional items banned from public inspection. </p> <p>Back in the mists of time - 1996 - Labour proposed that consumer groups, trade unions, industrial customers and environmental organisations have the right to take part in price reviews. The Bill now reads: 'The Secretary of State shall consult the holder of the Licence [the utilities] and such other persons as he considers appropriate.' I suppose that's better than democracy. </p> <p>Lord Neill's just-released report on corruption and influence in government is the Utility Bill's well-timed companion. While the proposed utility law slams the front door of government to the public, the Neill Committee holds open the back door for lobbyists and corporate chiefs. </p> <p>The committee's report dedicates an entire chapter to the Observer 's Lobbygate investigations. But after hearing from influence peddlers and their clients protesting their innocence, Neill concluded there is no need to register nor regulate lobbyists nor the business fixers who glide in and out of Downing Street. However, Neill boldly recommended that ministers and special advisors meeting with businessmen record these policy swap-fests in their official diaries. These are sealed for 30 years. 'The Circle', as Blair's advisoreRoger Liddle calls it, remains unbroken. From Ofwat to the Downing Street Policy Unit, the secrecy industry is back in business. </p> <p>Yet, despite this Government's best efforts, some information leaks out. US State Department memos obtained by Guardian reporters Rob Evans and David Hencke under America's Freedom of Information Act confirm what the lobbyists told me last June, that US utilities knew the timing and content of UK Cabinet deliberations on energy policy that month. This intelligence permitted the US Secretary of Commerce to quietly, and quite successfully, lobby the Blair Government on its legislative programme. </p> <p>So there you have it. The proposed Utility Bill will keep Britain's consumers out of the decision loop, but rest assured British policy is in good hands: Bill Clinton's, or rather, corporate America's. </p> <p>You can put your head in your hands and say it's appalling, but concede that Labour's shift from consumer friend to foe is amazing. It only took 1,000 days. </p> <p>gregory.palast@theguardian.com</p>",

Rather than thunder at the companies for 'gaming' (the industry's term for fiddling the system), Byatt poured praise on them for maintaining the system at a lower-than-expected cost. As their just reward, Byatt let shareholders keep what he oddly called 'efficiency gains'. But the companies did not maintain the system, they merely dumped workers off the payroll. Meanwhile, nearly a third of the nation's water simply bleeds out of leaky pipes. Over the 10 years of Byatt's watch, the amount of money shifted from operations and upgrades to shareholders easily topped \u00a34bn. Operating profits now eat up an eye-popping 45p out of each pound charged on a water and sewer bill. 'We're still on the learning curve,' says Byatt. The public has spent quite a lot on his education. Byatt was not alone in his amateur act. In 1996, when the electricity regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild was asked how he distinguished capital expenditures from operating expenditures, he replied: 'Does it make a difference?' Answer: Only to the customers who pay the bill for his loosey-goosey accounting rules. The basis of Keystone Kops regulation is the strange, cabbalistic system of price setting Professor Littlechild designed for Margaret Thatcher. Regulators determine prices in secretive, closed hugger-mugger with utility chiefs and their accountants. Consumers are barred from looking at company accounts. If the regulator, a virtual hostage to industry data, fails to do the utilities' bidding, companies may appeal to the Competition Commission. But consumers have no right to appeal against higher prices. Shareholders get the gold mine, customers get the shaft. Labour promised radical change. In its Utility Bill, the Government does not back away from its commitment. It performs a complete flip. Consumers' right to appeal? Forget it. And if a customer wants to eavesdrop on meetings of the regulator and regulated? Scram, Sam. To give the bill a little PR panache, the Government gives the organisation a spin. Out go the single regulators, in come panels. To watch over each new Regulatory Panel, hand-picked by the Department of Trade &amp; Industry Minister, the Government will set up a Consumer Panel, also picked by the Minister. What if real live bill-paying consumers want to look at the utility accounts seen by either the Tweedle-Dee panel or the Tweedle-Dum panel? 'That,' sniffed a DTI spokesman, 'will be taken care of under Mr Straw's Freedom of Information Bill.' Indeed it will. The proposed FOI Act bars regulatory agencies from releasing information given to them, 'in confidence' or which may be 'commercially sensitive' or which 'may affect share prices'. In the utility regulation game, that's just about everything. In case some information leaks through, the Bill provides for the Minister to issue a blacklist of additional items banned from public inspection. Back in the mists of time - 1996 - Labour proposed that consumer groups, trade unions, industrial customers and environmental organisations have the right to take part in price reviews. The Bill now reads: 'The Secretary of State shall consult the holder of the Licence [the utilities] and such other persons as he considers appropriate.' I suppose that's better than democracy. Lord Neill's just-released report on corruption and influence in government is the Utility Bill's well-timed companion. While the proposed utility law slams the front door of government to the public, the Neill Committee holds open the back door for lobbyists and corporate chiefs. The committee's report dedicates an entire chapter to the Observer 's Lobbygate investigations. But after hearing from influence peddlers and their clients protesting their innocence, Neill concluded there is no need to register nor regulate lobbyists nor the business fixers who glide in and out of Downing Street. However, Neill boldly recommended that ministers and special advisors meeting with businessmen record these policy swap-fests in their official diaries. These are sealed for 30 years. 'The Circle', as Blair's advisoreRoger Liddle calls it, remains unbroken. From Ofwat to the Downing Street Policy Unit, the secrecy industry is back in business. Yet, despite this Government's best efforts, some information leaks out. US State Department memos obtained by Guardian reporters Rob Evans and David Hencke under America's Freedom of Information Act confirm what the lobbyists told me last June, that US utilities knew the timing and content of UK Cabinet deliberations on energy policy that month. This intelligence permitted the US Secretary of Commerce to quietly, and quite successfully, lobby the Blair Government on its legislative programme. So there you have it. The proposed Utility Bill will keep Britain's consumers out of the decision loop, but rest assured British policy is in good hands: Bill Clinton's, or rather, corporate America's. You can put your head in your hands and say it's appalling, but concede that Labour's shift from consumer friend to foe is amazing. It only took 1,000 days. gregory.palast@theguardian.com",

Not one, not two, but three of the consortia looking to run the National Lottery desperately wanted the Watford site. So the owner could play one off against the others and negotiate a fat rent. </p> <p>The property firm in question could be looking forward to another payday soon. The seven-year licence to run the lottery from autumn next year is up for grabs, and the Camelot building, complete with a traffic roundabout which boasts a flowerbed in the shape of the company's crossed fingers logo, could end up in new hands. Parties interested in running one of the world's biggest lotteries, which has sold more than \u00a325 billion-worth of tickets, have 23 days to submit their bid. </p> <p>All of which makes it a curious time to be appointed the next chief executive of Camelot: the company may not exist this time next year. </p> <p>'It's very strange. We're a strange organisation in that sense,' agrees Dianne Thompson, Camelot's chief executive-designate. Thompson believes Camelot will produce a 'knockout bid', but suggests there is a chance of the company continuing to exist even if it loses the licence. 'There are other options. We've built great centres of expertise like our call centres. But at this stage we haven't considered what we would do.' </p> <p>Thompson is currently Camelot's commercial operations director, responsible for looking after the needs of players and retailers. She will step up to the top job next year if Camelot wins the new licence. But to do this, Camelot needs to beat off Richard Branson's People's Lottery consortium. Branson, of course, wanted to run the lottery last time around. So this time it's personal. </p> <p>There have been suggestions that because of the Virgin chief's perceived ability to exploit the public's concern over 'fat cat' directors, Camelot last week decided to cut its directors' pay packets. Thompson, for instance, will receive around \u00a3340,000 a year, compared with current chief executive Tim Holley's \u00a3482,000. </p> <p>'It's nothing to do with the People's Lottery,' said Thompson. 'The whole fat cat thing shows how stories grow legs of their own. The people who set Camelot up left good jobs and had no guarantee that they would get the licence. </p> <p>'The bonuses that caused all the fuss were, I think, a very fair reward. They took a big risk, but the situation is different now. I don't have to go through the start-up phase. I think it's only right that I don't get the same, because I'm not taking the same risk.' </p> <p>Camelot's biggest problem is not winning the next licence, but deciding what it will do if it does. Lotteries, as Camelot knows only too well, attract huge interest from the public in their infancy, but lose their shine as they get older. </p> <p>Take Camelot's last set of sales figures. Sales for the six months to 12 September this year were down around 7 per cent on the same period the previous year. Offsetting this sort of decline by introducing rafts of new games to stimulate public interest will be Thompson's main task, as will be managing the public's perception of the game. </p> <p>'There are quite a few myths surrounding the lottery in the public's minds,' she says. 'More than 30 per cent of people still think we decide where the money goes. The vast majority of people think we make much more than 1 per cent profits [just over the actual figure]. Then people say the jackpot should be capped, or that more people should share the prizes. But look at what happens when you have a rollover. You sell \u00a364 million-worth of tickets on a Wednes day draw, compared with \u00a326m in a normal week.' </p> <p>Thompson knows something about the fickleness of the public. After a stint heading Woolworths' marketing department she moved to Signet, the jewellery chain then run by Gerald Ratner. This was in 1994, not long after Ratner made his famous gaffe by saying that a Marks &amp; Spencer sandwich would last longer than some of his company's jewellery. </p> <p>'Gerald's remarks had just about destroyed the business. At the end of January 1991 the company made about \u00a3125m profit. He said his remarks in the April and at the end of January 1992 the business made a loss of \u00a3122m .' </p> <p>As marketing director, Thompson had to make a key decision. 'Could we save Ratners? The answer was no. It was a tough decision to make because it put several thousand people out of a job.' </p> <p>When she was offered the Camelot job, Thompson was unsure whether to take it. 'I like to go to places where there's a job for me to do. But when I got talking to Holley [Camelot's chief executive, who will next year become chairman of its putative overseas lottery division] about how it's easy to launch a lottery but the real success is keeping it driving forward, I was up for it.' </p> <p>Thompson's career might have been very different. Having graduated from Manchester University with a degree in French and English, she worked in the marketing department of the Co-operative Wholesale Society on the recommendation of a careers adviser. 'I'd no clue what marketing was,' she confesses. </p> <p>Prior to her stint at Signet she worked for a Swedish steel company as its UK managing director, a job which will have prepared her well for the goldfish-bowl nature of her new position. </p> <p>'It was unheard of in those days to be female in the steel industry. It amuses me, looking back. Being female was totally advantageous. People who would be too busy to see you normally were intrigued. They were all shocked. They expected somebody tall with permed hair and a handbag and there I was, five foot nothing and northern.' </p> <p>That sort of scrutiny will intensify now Thompson is to head Camelot.

Called the Business and Society Award, it is intended to highlight contributions by students - undergraduates and postgraduates - at more than 100 UK business schools, towards ethical and environmental initiatives. </p> <p>This is the third year that the ABS has run the awards scheme, in partnership with Clerical Medical and the Guardian and Observer . Previously, there were just two categories of award - one for undergraduates to demonstrate the benefits of their placement year and the other for MBA and other postgraduate students to show how their programme helped them to develop entrepreneurial skills. </p> <p>According to the Association's chief executive, Jonathan Slack, the rationale of setting up an award focused on the ethical side of business is clear enough. 'The ABS takes social and environmental responsibility in the workplace very seriously,' he says, 'and we give advice on teaching such issues in our MBA guidelines, and benchmarking standards for undergraduate business programmes.' </p> <p>The aim of the new award is to focus the minds of busi ness students - the future generation of corporate leaders - on the social and environmental responsibilities of the organisations they have contact with. 'Nowadays,' says Slack, 'with more mergers and global corporations earning larger revenues than many smaller countries, it's more necessary than ever to have an understanding of the real implications that businesses have on society at large.' </p> <p>On the other hand, he notes that 'more companies - including some mega-companies - are taking their social responsibilities to heart. They are looking at new areas of concern and how they can best generate an ethical image of themselves at the global level and many run schemes to ensure that society benefits from their activities and not just the company concerned.' </p> <p>For students who have been involved with such initiatives, the Business and Society Award offers an opportunity for wider recognition of their ideas and methods. The range of qualifying initiatives has deliberately been kept open-ended . </p> <p>'They could be in and around environmental issues,' says Slack, 'or they could be in different ways of pursuing an ethical line. They should show awareness of the impact a business has on the communities in which they're operating, whether it's at the production end or distribution - basically, any stage in the supply chain.' </p> <p>The award is not limited to how the private sector operates. 'It's open to students working in disaster areas or urban regeneration projects, for instance, where some of the funding comes from private companies as well as the public sector. The student may have been involved in improving job opportunities, in training schemes for young people, or in developing and implementing schemes in and around the social exclusion agenda. Or it could arise out of involvement in one of the mentoring schemes, like those being developed by the Institute of Directors, whereby more larger or sophisticated companies pass on their expertise in ethical or environmental areas to fledgling companies. We're taking a very broad view,' says Slack. </p> <p>The undergraduate Benefits of Work Placement Award and the MBA prize for entrepreneurship still stand as before. Indeed, the runner-up for last year's MBA Prize, Ian Holland, might have qualified for the new Business and Society Award. For in his role as Community Development Manager, he spearheaded the foundation of a new company to tackle social and economic problems on one of Europe's largest housing estates in Stoke-on-Trent. </p> <p>The initiative, known as the Villages Community Company, was set up as a partnership between three economic development agencies and representatives of five local communities with the aim of creating new companies and work opportunities. On receiving his award, Holland said that 'the creation of the new company was inspired by my MBA [part-time at Manchester Business School]. Modules of the course, for example strategy, marketing, accounting, management of change and statistics, have all been used over recent months to bring partners together and to forge the new company's vision, aims, staff and cash flow.' </p> <p>But the winner of last year's MBA award for entrepreneurship was Richard Downs, who spent the latter part of his two-year MBA programme at the London Business School setting up Iglu.com, a website that handles bookings for ski chalets and other winter sports accommodation. </p> <p>'Doing an MBA helped me tremendously,' says Downs, whose company now employs 38 people and 'is doubling in size every three months'. And while he admits that 'you hear counter-views on whether the MBA is synergistic with entrepreneurship, I found it very useful to step back and study different markets and business models.' He particularly benefited from an exchange scheme that took him to the University of Berkeley in California, right on the doorstep of Silicon Valley. 'What some of the companies are doing there is awesome. It gave me an insight into the future.' Which to Downs means the breathtaking rise of e-commerce (a subject now taught as an elective at many UK business schools). </p> <p>The undergraduate award focuses on the benefits of work-placement schemes. Typically, these take up a full year in the latter part of a four-year programme and, as Slack points out, students can now expect to be paid \u00a310-\u00a312,000 by their employers as rates have increased in line with graduates' starting salaries.' </p> <p>Last year's winner was Emma Blake, a BA student at Cheltenham and Gloucester College of Higher Education. Her placement with British Aerospace Defence Systems soon found her with financial control over eight projects; while her guidelines to assist staff fill in BAe's 'Achieving Customer Excellence' evaluation forms were adopted by the company. </p> <p>Commenting on her work placement, Blake says: 'It has been absolutely brilliant. I have learned so much in only 12 months and acquired skills and knowledge that will help my progression through the rest of my life.' </p> <p><strong> How to enter</strong> </p> <p>Students are invited to enter now for this year's competition, which is open to 2 May. </p> <p><strong> The Business and Society Award</strong> is open to both undergraduates and postgraduates.

      "body": "<p>'Chips with everything'. 'Wafer thin margins.' The headlines are enough to give you indigestion. </p> <p>But it is not simply the bad puns using semiconductor industry jargon (chips are made from sheets of silicon called wafers) that encourage investors in the sector to reach for the indigestion tablets. The industry itself is bulimic, bingeing on growth before purging in periods of sharp downturn. </p> <p>Semiconductors may be the vital ingredient that has powered the information revolution - without them dot.com mania would not exist - but while Internet company valuations have defied gravity on jam-tomorrow earnings projections, semiconductors have become staple commodities, demanding huge initial investment and huge demand to make returns. </p> <p>The rewards for investors can be large and, unlike with Internet stocks, there are real profits from real products. Growth in the past 40 years has averaged 15 per cent a year. Last year, the industry turned over $148 billion. </p> <p>But as Andrew Griffin, semiconductor analyst at Merrill Lynch, points out, the prices are on a roller-coaster. 'Everything is governed by the three- to five-year cycle. It starts with overcapacity and weak demand following a previous cycle. Then new, hitherto uneconomic applications come along - mobile phones and digital set top boxes are now viable, because prices have fallen. </p> <p>'Demand soars, capacity is taken up, and the industry responds by creating more. Then there is overcapacity again, prices fall, and demand tails off until new applications trigger it again.' </p> <p>The early Nineties saw an upturn, before a slump in 1995, and another in 1998. In slump years, revenue growth slows to below 10 per cent. At the moment, things are recovering. </p> <p>The huge cost (\u00a32bn) of building a chip fabrication plant or 'Fab' is what drives this volatility. Companies can spend 25 per cent of their revenues on new capacity. Griffin says: 'The problem is not only expense, but the time it takes to build plants. Companies are trying to plan two years ahead, but they can only see two months. </p> <p>'Depreciation is a huge cost for companies that build Fabs. This is a direct charge against profits, and it drives the need to find markets for output.' </p> <p>Rapidly advancing technology helps the process. As the transistors and circuits in chips become smaller and faster, they become cheaper, which reduces production costs. But then prices go down, so volume is the key. </p> <p>The figures are dramatic - the cost of producing a chip falls up to 90 per cent in five years. Margins stay the same, and so prices fall equally. This phenomenon is known as 'Moore's Law'. </p> <p>The last slump in 1998, which saw world chip prices slashed and industry rev enues fall 7.5 per cent - the loss of 1,800 jobs at Siemens and Fujitsu on Tyneside was a direct result - held deeper significance than most. It marked the end of personal computers being the engine of semiconductor expansion. </p> <p>According to Jean Philippe Dauvin of Italian-French manufacturer STMicroelectronics: 'In the Sixties and Seventies the industry was driven by major corporations' demand for mainframe computers.' This was the era of IBM and the first generation of chip suppliers - Texas Instruments, Motorola and so on. </p> <p>'By the early Eighties you move to improving the productivity of small companies, and that meant personal computers. For the past 15 years the semiconductor industry has been PC-driven.' </p> <p>The growth of global industry leader Intel, maker of the Pentium microprocessors in PCs, along with the largely Asian manufacturers of computer memory (known as DRAM), has been hitched to 20 per cent annual growth in PC sales. </p> <p>In 1999, says Dauvin, there were 600 million PCs at work in the world, while 120 million new ones were sold. </p> <p>But the end of the line is coming. Analysts believe PC markets are now near saturation. </p> <p>Of course, Dauvin would say this because STM is hoping to be in pole position to gain from the emergence of mobile technology. </p> <p>But the immediate question is: what does this all mean for the mighty Intel? Intel currently accounts for 16.7 per cent of the world market - more than 10 per cent per cent ahead of the number two, NEC - and turns over $22bn a year. How does it stop being the IBM of the 2000s? </p> <p>Joe Osha, Intel watcher at Merrill Lynch, says the com pany's strength has so far has been its ability to defy the cycle through innovation. 'Intel has been on its own growth curve, and was not affected by the downturn in the mid-1990s,' he says. </p> <p>Osha says Intel's success goes back to the 1980s, when it realised that microprocessors rather than DRAM memory would give greater growth prospects. </p> <p>It found the ideal partner in Microsoft, which has added functions and upgrades to its Windows operating system throughout the 1990s. </p> <p>But, says Osha, the big problems started in 1998, in the second 'dip' of a double-dip slump. This was partly to do with poor sales of Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system - sales of Windows 95 had helped Intel through the first trough. </p> <p>But there are more fundamental economics at work. Osha says: 'Intel has been driven by people's demand for greater processing speed and more PC applications.

      "bodyText": "'Chips with everything'. 'Wafer thin margins.' The headlines are enough to give you indigestion. But it is not simply the bad puns using semiconductor industry jargon (chips are made from sheets of silicon called wafers) that encourage investors in the sector to reach for the indigestion tablets. The industry itself is bulimic, bingeing on growth before purging in periods of sharp downturn. Semiconductors may be the vital ingredient that has powered the information revolution - without them dot.com mania would not exist - but while Internet company valuations have defied gravity on jam-tomorrow earnings projections, semiconductors have become staple commodities, demanding huge initial investment and huge demand to make returns. The rewards for investors can be large and, unlike with Internet stocks, there are real profits from real products. Growth in the past 40 years has averaged 15 per cent a year. Last year, the industry turned over $148 billion. But as Andrew Griffin, semiconductor analyst at Merrill Lynch, points out, the prices are on a roller-coaster. 'Everything is governed by the three- to five-year cycle. It starts with overcapacity and weak demand following a previous cycle. Then new, hitherto uneconomic applications come along - mobile phones and digital set top boxes are now viable, because prices have fallen. 'Demand soars, capacity is taken up, and the industry responds by creating more. Then there is overcapacity again, prices fall, and demand tails off until new applications trigger it again.' The early Nineties saw an upturn, before a slump in 1995, and another in 1998. In slump years, revenue growth slows to below 10 per cent. At the moment, things are recovering. The huge cost (\u00a32bn) of building a chip fabrication plant or 'Fab' is what drives this volatility. Companies can spend 25 per cent of their revenues on new capacity. Griffin says: 'The problem is not only expense, but the time it takes to build plants. Companies are trying to plan two years ahead, but they can only see two months. 'Depreciation is a huge cost for companies that build Fabs. This is a direct charge against profits, and it drives the need to find markets for output.' Rapidly advancing technology helps the process. As the transistors and circuits in chips become smaller and faster, they become cheaper, which reduces production costs. But then prices go down, so volume is the key. The figures are dramatic - the cost of producing a chip falls up to 90 per cent in five years. Margins stay the same, and so prices fall equally. This phenomenon is known as 'Moore's Law'. The last slump in 1998, which saw world chip prices slashed and industry rev enues fall 7.5 per cent - the loss of 1,800 jobs at Siemens and Fujitsu on Tyneside was a direct result - held deeper significance than most. It marked the end of personal computers being the engine of semiconductor expansion. According to Jean Philippe Dauvin of Italian-French manufacturer STMicroelectronics: 'In the Sixties and Seventies the industry was driven by major corporations' demand for mainframe computers.' This was the era of IBM and the first generation of chip suppliers - Texas Instruments, Motorola and so on. 'By the early Eighties you move to improving the productivity of small companies, and that meant personal computers. For the past 15 years the semiconductor industry has been PC-driven.' The growth of global industry leader Intel, maker of the Pentium microprocessors in PCs, along with the largely Asian manufacturers of computer memory (known as DRAM), has been hitched to 20 per cent annual growth in PC sales. In 1999, says Dauvin, there were 600 million PCs at work in the world, while 120 million new ones were sold. But the end of the line is coming. Analysts believe PC markets are now near saturation. Of course, Dauvin would say this because STM is hoping to be in pole position to gain from the emergence of mobile technology. But the immediate question is: what does this all mean for the mighty Intel? Intel currently accounts for 16.7 per cent of the world market - more than 10 per cent per cent ahead of the number two, NEC - and turns over $22bn a year. How does it stop being the IBM of the 2000s? Joe Osha, Intel watcher at Merrill Lynch, says the com pany's strength has so far has been its ability to defy the cycle through innovation. 'Intel has been on its own growth curve, and was not affected by the downturn in the mid-1990s,' he says. Osha says Intel's success goes back to the 1980s, when it realised that microprocessors rather than DRAM memory would give greater growth prospects. It found the ideal partner in Microsoft, which has added functions and upgrades to its Windows operating system throughout the 1990s. But, says Osha, the big problems started in 1998, in the second 'dip' of a double-dip slump. This was partly to do with poor sales of Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system - sales of Windows 95 had helped Intel through the first trough. But there are more fundamental economics at work. Osha says: 'Intel has been driven by people's demand for greater processing speed and more PC applications. Now it is getting harder to understand why they need more Microsoft buttons on their PCs.' So what does it do next? Jump on to the Internet, of course. Analysts believe the biggest opportunity for Intel will be in providing processors for servers - the massive computers which are the backbone for the Internet. International IT consultant IDC estimates that Intel will make strong moves into the small, medium and large server market. For larger servers, it estimates that Intel's market share will move from 14 to 48 per cent; for intermediate size from 27 to 62 per cent; and at the smallest end from 89 to 96 per cent. As a sign of its determination to break into this new market, Intel has been working with Linux, a major software provider for servers. Closer relationships with Linux will, it hopes, also help it break into the mobile and digital markets, perhaps the biggest new growth areas. Griffin says: 'There are two new paradigms affecting the industry - mobile phones which allow access to the Internet and allow huge new applications for communication; and broadband home access, which allows home shopping, real-time pausing of TV and so on.' It could also mean a shift in the base of manufacturing. Griffin says: 'The companies that are at the forefront on these new applications are often Europe-based: Nokia, Ericsson and so on.' He believes manufacturers such as Philips, Infinion and Dauvin's STM, which have good relationships with customers and are at the leading edge of technology, will be among the leaders. 'America is waking up to this,' says an industry expert. 'Five years ago, when STM went to the US, people in Silicon Valley would say \"Who are these guys with the silly Italian accents?\" They don't say that any more.' Dauvin says: 'This is the third great advance - after the big corporation with mainframes, and the small companies, it is now time for individuals with mobiles.'

Little picked up the ball after the subdued Roberts had given it away and, with three defenders surrounding him in the centre circle, threaded his way between all of them before breaking free in the box and chipping the advancing keeper. </p> <p>'I'd loved to have passed it, but there was no one around,' said Little afterwards, 'so I just got on with it and went off on my own. It has to be the best goal I've ever scored.' </p> <p>'It was a sensational goal,' said Burnley's boss Stan Ternant, 'absolutely world-class, and would deserve to win any match. But the result was not just about the goal, it was a magnificent team performance in which we showed tremendous spirit against massive adversity.' </p> <p>Clearly anticipating a late onslaught, Ternant replaced Little with an extra defender for a frantic final quarter of an hour in which Rovers deployed four strikers and forced six corners in quick succession. But, thanks in large part to the agility of keeper Paul Crichton, they failed to find a way through. </p> <p>Rovers manager Ian Holloway said: 'It was a magnificent goal, but I have to be disappointed, we came to win. But we are still on target - one defeat against a very good Burnley side isn't going to change that. There is still a lot of football to be played this season and we'll just go back to work and get on with it.' </p> <p>Neither manager chose to comment on the sending off of Payton, which came as Rovers prepared to defend a free-kick into the box. Payton appeared to head-butt defender Trevor Challis. The referee missed it but, following consultation with his linesman, showed the striker the red card. </p> <p>Ternant said: 'I didn't see the incident but I know it takes two to tango and I felt we were on the wrong end of a lot of decisions today.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "A magnificent solo goal from Glen Little gave 10-man Burnley an eighth successive home win in a pulsating match, enhancing the Clarets' promotion challenge while knocking Rovers off the top of Division Two in the process. Little's 70th-minute effort would have graced any Premiership game and rightly overshadowed the other major talking point, the 27th minute sending off of Burnley's leading scorer Andy Payton for violent conduct. Ironically, it was a mistake by Rovers' own leading scorer, 17-goal Jason Roberts, which led to the goal. Little picked up the ball after the subdued Roberts had given it away and, with three defenders surrounding him in the centre circle, threaded his way between all of them before breaking free in the box and chipping the advancing keeper. 'I'd loved to have passed it, but there was no one around,' said Little afterwards, 'so I just got on with it and went off on my own. It has to be the best goal I've ever scored.' 'It was a sensational goal,' said Burnley's boss Stan Ternant, 'absolutely world-class, and would deserve to win any match. But the result was not just about the goal, it was a magnificent team performance in which we showed tremendous spirit against massive adversity.' Clearly anticipating a late onslaught, Ternant replaced Little with an extra defender for a frantic final quarter of an hour in which Rovers deployed four strikers and forced six corners in quick succession. But, thanks in large part to the agility of keeper Paul Crichton, they failed to find a way through. Rovers manager Ian Holloway said: 'It was a magnificent goal, but I have to be disappointed, we came to win. But we are still on target - one defeat against a very good Burnley side isn't going to change that. There is still a lot of football to be played this season and we'll just go back to work and get on with it.' Neither manager chose to comment on the sending off of Payton, which came as Rovers prepared to defend a free-kick into the box. Payton appeared to head-butt defender Trevor Challis. The referee missed it but, following consultation with his linesman, showed the striker the red card. Ternant said: 'I didn't see the incident but I know it takes two to tango and I felt we were on the wrong end of a lot of decisions today.'",

Click here to watch the scene from The Usual Suspects.</a></p> <p>That is how director Bryan Singer remembers the scene that tops the Observer poll. \"The film won two Academy Awards but in a way this is more significant because then we were up against the best films of 1995, while this survey is comparing a moment in The Usual Suspects to all the great moments in film history.\" The nature of the list also appeals to Singer: \"Films to me are great lines and great moments - it is amazing to me that we should come out top. It is a testament to how much people like to be tricked: if you trick them the right way, they will love you forever; if you get it wrong, you will never work again.\" </p> <p>The whole film is built on lies. Five criminals meet at a police line-up, plan and execute a successful robbery. And they are then approached by the arch criminal Keyser Soze via his henchman, the lawyer Kobayashi, played by Pete Postlethwaite. He makes them an offer - work for the devil or die. The tale is told in flashback by Kevin Spacey's character, the crippled Verbal Kint - already granted immunity from prosecution - as he is interrogated by customs officer Dave Kujan, played by Chazz Palminteri.</p> <p>But this revelation scene is not the original. Singer screened the first version for two friends - his agent and his lawyer - before realising that it was, \"too flat?it was confusing and just kind of died\". It had the crashing coffee cup falling out of Kujan's hand, the bulletin board and the fax with the face of Keyser Soze, which seems to take forever to come off the machine. But after that first screening, Singer introduced the visual flashbacks as Kujan scans the board and finally realises that he has been conned by Spacey's Kint - aka Keyser Soze - who is shuffling out of police headquarters after being released by Kujan.</p> <p>Singer added audio flashbacks. So in hindsight we hear from disembodied voices, with Spacey's saying: \"It's all there, I'm telling it straight, I swear,\" as Kujan scans the board and finds references to some of the places and characters from Spacey's elaborate lie staring down from the board. <br> \"It works because of the way Kevin carries the moment, the choice of music - how it shifts gear and takes a completely different rhythm from the rest of the film,\" says Singer. \"There are all kinds of scenes and pieces of the film being played out before your eyes - the images are flooding down from the bulletin board. The coffee cup goes crashing in slow motion and all the time you are seeing images from the film that you thought meant one thing but you now realise mean something completely different. We pulled together every bit of sound which hinted that Kevin was Keyser Soze. The flashbacks and audio were all keenly placed to sit with certain images and then we stuck all the magnetic tape together and waited to see the result.\" The scene was the idea of screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie. He and Singer had made a low-budget film, Public Access, in 1993 that won an award at the Sundance film festival. The duo was seeking a new project and McQuarrie came up with the idea of five criminals meeting at a police line-up. The bulletin board scene was the second he wrote and the film was then effectively written in reverse. \"It is one of the few times I can watch something that I have done. Obviously I am biased, but I think it was a successful surprise, and it had been a long time since a surprise ending had actually caught people by surprise.\"</p> <h2>2: Psycho - The shower scene</h2> <p>(Alfred Hitchcock, US, 1960)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8VP5jEAP3K4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-8VP5jEAP3K4\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8VP5jEAP3K4?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"276\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=8VP5jEAP3K4\">Reading on mobile? Click here to watch the scene from Psycho.</a></p> <p>\"Mary started to scream, and then the curtains parted further and a hand appeared, holding a butcher's knife. It was the knife that, a moment later, cut off her scream. And her head.\" Bang. End of chapter three.<br>The most famous screen murder of all time is over in a flash in Robert Bloch's original novel: three lines, in fact.</p> <p>In Joseph Stefano's screenplay, 'Mary' became Marion, her head stayed mercifully on, and this goreless, staccato passage was transformed by Hitchcock, 'pictorial consultant' Saul Bass, editor George Tomasini and composer Bernard Herrmann into a landmark of postwar cinema and one of the most imitated and parodied sequences ever committed to film. What's more, on a non-academic level, it's as intensely powerful today as it ever was.</p> <p>Famously shot on an $800,000 shoestring in six weeks with a crew from Hitchcock's TV series, Psycho was dismissed by the critics on its release - partly because there were no preview screenings - but it made $15 million in its first year, earned four Oscar nominations and accidentally kickstarted the slasher movie genre (not to mention three mediocre sequels of its own). It has since been listed by the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress, slowed down and turned into an art installation, sent up in The Simpsons and remade, shot for shot, by Gus Van Sant (proving, if nothing else, that colour ruins it). </p> <p>The 45-second shower scene, shot in seven days using 70 separate camera set-ups, is not just the most memorable in the film, it is the plot pivot, the unexpected - and unexpectedly vicious - dispatch of the leading lady (Janet Leigh) halfway through. Indeed, Marion Crane's spontaneous theft of $40,000 from her realtor boss and subsequent paranoid flight from Phoenix is a lengthy MacGuffin - it is her murder by motelier Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) dressed as his dead mother that signals the 'beginning' of the story. As such, the shower is unique in that it can legitimately be viewed and appreciated in isolation as a bravura example of the filmmaker's art, or enjoyed as the narrative masterstroke in a very clever movie. (It's easy to see why Hitchcock banned exhibitors from letting in audiences once Psycho had started.)</p> <p>The trivia of Hitchcock's most celebrated and raked-over scene sometimes threatens to overtake its visual power, but nuggets like these are hard to resist: for instance, Marion could have been played by Eva Marie Saint, Shirley Jones, Lana Turner or Hope Lange. The silhouetted 'Mother' behind the shower curtain was played by Ann Dore (one of five different uncredited actresses responsible for creating Mrs Bates - three for her physical scenes, plus two for her voice, spliced with that of Paul Jasmin, an actor pal of Tony Perkins). The censors demanded the removal of one shot in which they believed Leigh's nipple was visible, but in actual fact, only her head, feet and arms are seen - the rest is stand-in Marli Renfro, a nude model, whose dignity was preserved through judicial use of moleskin patches and glue. </p> <p>The blood that swirls downs the plughole is chocolate sauce, the stabbing sound effects were created by violating a Turkish melon, Janet Leigh postponed the filming twice due to a cold and then her period, and for the final shot of her inert form, she wore contact lenses to create the dilated pupils.Perhaps the scene's biggest talking point down the years has been the contention that graphic supremo Saul Bass, having storyboarded the scene, also directed it. He made this claim himself in 1973, presumably sore that Hitchcock had written his contributions to this and the Arbogast murder scene out of the story. (Bass had not only storyboarded both, he actually shot and assembled a montage to prove that the shower scene would work). However, Janet Leigh has since put the records straight: \"Saul Bass was there for the shooting, but he never directed me.\"Whatever. When Francois Truffaut interviewed Hitchcock in 1962, the director said that his 'main satisfaction' regarding Psycho was that it 'had an effect on the audience' - a desire more than realised by the shower scene's continuing legacy. \"It wasn't a message that stirred the audience,' commented Hitchcock. 'Nor was it a great performance?They were aroused by pure film.\"</p> <h2>3: The Third Man - Harry Lime appears</h2> <p>(Carol Reed, UK, 1949)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iwqnHa1BRWI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-iwqnHa1BRWI\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iwqnHa1BRWI?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"276\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=iwqnHa1BRWI\">Reading on mobile? Click here to watch the scene from The Third Man.</a></p> <p>It nearly wasn't him. Noel Coward could have made the most famous entrance in cinema history. Then producer David O. Selznick wanted Robert Mitchum to play legendary racketeer Harry Lime. That particular star put paid to his chances after being arrested and imprisoned for marijuana possession in 1948. So Welles it would be then. Selznick initially resisted the Hollywood maverick: Welles's box-office appeal had slumped disastrously.</p> <p>In reality Welles's appearance was so late in the film his star billing could seem undeserved. He didn't appear in The Third Man until an hour into the film. And even then he didn't speak. Naive American writer, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), was in ravaged post-war Vienna trying to unravel the mystery of his best friend Lime's apparent death. Up to this point moviegoers had been entranced by Reed's noir-ish vision of a city near breakdown. Incidentally, Observer readers found more moments to savour in The Third Man than any other film. Harry Lime's cuckoo clock speech narrowly failed to make it on to the final list. But there was no doubt about the film's most treasured scene. As is often the case, an odd twist of fortune played a part in the circumstances leading to the film's pivotal scene.</p> <p>Characteristically, Welles was less than committed when working for another director. He'd often disappear, trying to raise funds for his Othello adaptation from financiers across Europe. On one occasion he was in Rome while needed on set. In desperation Reed often ordered assistant director Guy Hamilton to take his place so he could shoot an ominous figure running thorough the streets. \"He made me dress up in a big black coat with padded shoulders because I was rather skinny,\" he recalled.</p> <p>Fortunately Welles was around for his most famous close-up. The night scene had been smartly set up. Moments after Lime's former girlfriend, Anna Schmidt, told Martins her cat 'only likes Harry', it had stolen outside and snuggled against the shoes of a mysterious man hiding in a doorway. When a drunk Martins leaves her flat, he is aware of a man on the other side of the street. Martins taunts him: \"Cat got your tongue? Come on out! Come out, come out, whoever you are.\" He rouses an indignant Frau who switches on a light above the door illuminating Lime's face.</p> <p>At the realisation that his plans to disappear have been undone by chance, Lime smiles enigmatically. His face is mischievous, not malicious. The film's villain clearly likes a joke. For all the Third Man's virtues - a British Film Institute poll saw it voted the best British film ever - the scenes with Welles dominate. Whether he is hiding in a doorway or philosophising on a Ferris wheel, Welles is the film's iconic motif.</p> <p>At a time when independent sensibilities seem to be encouraged in Hollywood, Welles is the patron saint of pigheadedness. It's hardly surprising contemporary left-fielder Tim Robbins' latest film The Cradle Will Rock is based on one of Welles's early artistic struggles in the theatre. Welles displayed little humility on the set of The Third Man; he frequently offered directing tips to Reed and rewrote his own lines, improvising the cuckoo clock speech. \"It's true that Orson suddenly produced it while on set,\" says Hamilton. \"Carol said: 'It's a goody, let's use it.'\" On screen, as in life, he cut a larger-than-life figure. A decade later he emerged as a grotesque villain in his own creation Touch of Evil, but in The Third Man he played the most appealing of characters: a charismatic baddie.</p> <p><strong>More Third Man moments and the strange case of Citizen Kane</strong><br>Naturally, many films received votes for more than one moment. Casablanca and Jaws both did themselves no favours in terms of the final list by throwing up so many memorable scenes. Citizen Kane (below) suffered more than any other film from this effect, votes for which were so varied that no one moment made the final 100. (By contrast, the greatest beneficiary was our poll topper, The Usual Suspects which, beyond the winning moment, barely received a mention.) Of our 100, The Third Man elicited the greatest variety. Here's a few of the nearly list.</p> <p>\u2022The final scene. Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) ignores Holly Martins by walking past him after Harry Lime's funeral.</p> <p>\u2022Harry Lime defends himself to Martins on a Ferris wheel ride. \"In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.\"</p> <p>\u2022Orson Welles's hands appear through the grating at street level, grasping the air, after being shot trying to escape the police in the sewers.</p> <p>\u2022A mournful Anna Schmidt lies in bed wearing Harry Lime's pyjamas shortly before a visit from Martins.</p> <p>\u2022A moon-faced boy, holding a ball, shouts at Holly Martins and Anna Schmidt as he chases them away from the murder scene of the vital witness, provoking suspicion from on-lookers that Martins was responsible.</p> <h2>4: 2001: A Space Odyssey - From flying bone to space ship</h2> <p>(Stanley Kubrick, UK, 1968)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qtbOmpTnyOc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-qtbOmpTnyOc\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qtbOmpTnyOc?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"276\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=qtbOmpTnyOc\">Reading on mobile? Click here to watch the scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey.</a></p> <p>Kubrick's beautiful but baffling sci-fi opus billed itself as The Ultimate Trip, spanning many, many thousands of years, from the dawn of man to the first, futuristic steps into space and, with typically Kubrick hubris, 2001 announces this with one simple, majestic cut. <br> Having introduced us to a jabbering community of ape-men, Kubrick reveals a mysterious, coal-black and clearly alien totem that seems to exert a strange influence over this primitive race. Ape-gangs clash, tempers fray, and when their leader thwacks down his club into a pile of bones, he sends them flying into the air - which Kubrick seamlessly matches with a jump-cut that shows a spaceship seeming to follow its graceful trajectory into the starry void of space, accompanied by the triumphant strains of Also Sprach Zarathustra. This wordless leap is typical of Kubrick's open-ended, psychedelic movie: although it lasts some two hours and 20 minutes, there are only 40 minutes of dialogue, and the significance is left to the viewer's imagination. </p> <p>The film's co-creator, Arthur C Clarke, claimed that the film was meant to be unsolvable, going so far as to claim that \"if you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to ask more questions than we posed\". Kubrick was never happy with this explanation and claimed that Clarke was speaking 'facetiously'. However, he did believe in preserving the film's mystery, asking Playboy magazine, \"How much would we appreciate La Gioconda today if Leonardo had written at the bottom of the canvas: 'This lady is smiling slightly because she has rotten teeth' or 'because she's hiding a secret from her lover'? It would shut off the viewer's appreciation and shackle him to a 'reality' other than his own. I don't want that to happen to 2001.\"<br> <strong>View from the stalls</strong><br>\"The moment is special because it manages to encompass the entire evolution of the human race in one graceful visual metaphor. The ape has used a weapon for the first time and this sets the course of development that culminates in the nuclear bomb\". Robert West, Oxford</p> <h2>5: Apocalypse Now - Dawn helicopter attack</h2> <p>(Francis Ford Coppola, US, 1979)</p> <p>Apocalypse Now was method filmmaking: the film that was as insane as the war itself. And never more so than during the making of the film's showpiece: the scene where insanely gung-ho Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall) and his Air Calvary helicopters swarm out of the dawn light to flatten a Vietcong village, speakers blasting out Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries' as they go (the great film critic Pauline Kael bizarrely tried to dissuade Coppola from using the music on the grounds that it had already been used in a European arthouse movie).</p> <p>Having already set up the hugely expensive scene, Coppola tried to bully the US secretary of defence into providing a lifting helicopter for the scene. The helicopters they did have were borrowed from Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos, and were called away in the middle of the shooting of the scene to be used in a real war against Communist guerrillas. \"We just heard they're taking away five of our helicopters,\" Coppola rages in the documentary Hearts Of Darkness, clearly no longer able to realise he was only making a film about a war. When he did have the choppers, all he could do was complain about the incompetence of the Filipino pilots.</p> <p>But the result is stunning, the craziness and the appeal of war brought together. \"Men play strange games to break up the boredom of being in the war,\" Duvall once said, explaining Kilgore, the man who insists on having his troops surf in the middle of battle. But the real genius of the scene comes not from the grandiose explosions, or even the strange beauty of the attack helicopters, but from some subtle acting: the incredulous expression on Martin Sheen's face as he watches Kilgore in action. </p> <h2>6: Blade Runner - Batty's dying speech in the rain</h2> <p>(Ridley Scott, US, 1982)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a_saUN4j7Gw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-a_saUN4j7Gw\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a_saUN4j7Gw?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"276\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=a_saUN4j7Gw\">Reading this on mobile?

I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tanhauser Gate. All these moments will be lost in time. Like tears in rain. Time to die.\"</p> <p>After Rutger Hauer (Batty) delivered his final soliloquy, the surrounding crew applauded and a few even cried. It wasn't just the replicant's final poignant words that stirred them. Finishing the rain-sodden scene marked the end of an arduous shoot. The exhaustion on Harrison Ford's face as he watches his man-made adversary's demise isn't just acting. He was knackered. Originally Hauer's speech was much longer but the actor persuaded Scott to cut the dialogue saving the audience another protracted death scene. \"His batteries are going. He has no time to say good-bye, except maybe to briefly talk about things he'd seen. 'Life is short' - boom!\" </p> <p>With Scott's permission he cut out the beginning and improvised the last lines. Although Hauer crafted the speech to suit himself, he paid tribute to screenwriter David Peoples for doing 'a really beautiful job'. \"I loved those images he came up with - 'c-beams glittering near the Tanhauser gate, attack ships off the shoulder of Orion'. I thought they were really interesting, even if you didn't understand them.\" </p> <h2>7: The Great Escape - The Cooler King escapes on his motorbike</h2> <p>(John Sturges, US, 1963)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BaFBFmJG-LI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-BaFBFmJG-LI\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BaFBFmJG-LI?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"276\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=BaFBFmJG-LI\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to watch the scene from the Great Escape.</a></p> <p>Hot off the back of The Magnificent Seven but basically still a TV actor, Steve McQueen almost turned down The Great Escape (\"I just did two WWII flicks and they both died in the stretch\", he told director Sturges, referring to Hell Is For Heroes and The War Lover). In the end, he took it on the proviso that he was allowed to ride a motorcycle - a typically brattish, macho McQueen demand, but one which sealed his iconic fate, for the climactic two-wheeled leap over a six-foot barbed-wire fence remains the defining image of the film.<br>McQueen, playing loner POW Hilts ('the Cooler King') breaks out of the prisoncompound, steals a motorbike from a German soldier using piano wire across a road, and dons his uniform. It is actually McQueen in the saddle during the resulting chase - in fact, he also doubled for a German soldier in pursuit (\"With exceptional cutting,\" commented Sturges, \"Steve could've played the entire German motorcycle corps\"). The famous jump over the wire was achieved by McQueen's stunt double, long-time pal and bike shop owner Buddy Ekins, on a souped-up Triumph. With the cameras rolling, he cleared it in one take (\"Nothing like that had ever been done before,\" said Ekins).</p> <p>Ironically, the heroic jump does not lead to Hilts' escape - he falls at the next fence - but the scene made McQueen. In Britain, mods and rockers went to see the film over and over again for the jump; they stood up and cheered every time. </p> <h2>8: Casablanca - Rick and Ilsa part at the airport</h2> <p>(Michael Curtiz, US, 1942)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rEWaqUVac3M?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-rEWaqUVac3M\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rEWaqUVac3M?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"276\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=rEWaqUVac3M\">Reading this on mobile?

As scriptwriter Howard Koch recalled, \"The ending of the film was in the air until the very end. We thought of many possibilities and finally decided on the one that was in the film.\" Of course, any other ending would have ruined the film, both as a tragic love story and as a great piece of anti-fascist propaganda. As it was, these were the words Warner Bros's squad of writers cobbled together for Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa to say as they stood on the runway:<br> Rick: Inside of us, we both know you belong with Victor.

      "bodyText": "1: The Usual Suspects - Kujan realises that he has been conned... (Bryan Singer, US, 1995) \"It was one of those rare occasions when you could lie to an audience and because there were so many aspects to the film the audience would accept lies - it made the ending all the more exciting and powerful.\" Reading on mobile? Click here to watch the scene from The Usual Suspects. That is how director Bryan Singer remembers the scene that tops the Observer poll. \"The film won two Academy Awards but in a way this is more significant because then we were up against the best films of 1995, while this survey is comparing a moment in The Usual Suspects to all the great moments in film history.\" The nature of the list also appeals to Singer: \"Films to me are great lines and great moments - it is amazing to me that we should come out top. It is a testament to how much people like to be tricked: if you trick them the right way, they will love you forever; if you get it wrong, you will never work again.\" The whole film is built on lies. Five criminals meet at a police line-up, plan and execute a successful robbery. And they are then approached by the arch criminal Keyser Soze via his henchman, the lawyer Kobayashi, played by Pete Postlethwaite. He makes them an offer - work for the devil or die. The tale is told in flashback by Kevin Spacey's character, the crippled Verbal Kint - already granted immunity from prosecution - as he is interrogated by customs officer Dave Kujan, played by Chazz Palminteri. But this revelation scene is not the original. Singer screened the first version for two friends - his agent and his lawyer - before realising that it was, \"too flat?it was confusing and just kind of died\". It had the crashing coffee cup falling out of Kujan's hand, the bulletin board and the fax with the face of Keyser Soze, which seems to take forever to come off the machine. But after that first screening, Singer introduced the visual flashbacks as Kujan scans the board and finally realises that he has been conned by Spacey's Kint - aka Keyser Soze - who is shuffling out of police headquarters after being released by Kujan. Singer added audio flashbacks. So in hindsight we hear from disembodied voices, with Spacey's saying: \"It's all there, I'm telling it straight, I swear,\" as Kujan scans the board and finds references to some of the places and characters from Spacey's elaborate lie staring down from the board. \"It works because of the way Kevin carries the moment, the choice of music - how it shifts gear and takes a completely different rhythm from the rest of the film,\" says Singer. \"There are all kinds of scenes and pieces of the film being played out before your eyes - the images are flooding down from the bulletin board. The coffee cup goes crashing in slow motion and all the time you are seeing images from the film that you thought meant one thing but you now realise mean something completely different. We pulled together every bit of sound which hinted that Kevin was Keyser Soze. The flashbacks and audio were all keenly placed to sit with certain images and then we stuck all the magnetic tape together and waited to see the result.\" The scene was the idea of screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie. He and Singer had made a low-budget film, Public Access, in 1993 that won an award at the Sundance film festival. The duo was seeking a new project and McQuarrie came up with the idea of five criminals meeting at a police line-up. The bulletin board scene was the second he wrote and the film was then effectively written in reverse. \"It is one of the few times I can watch something that I have done. Obviously I am biased, but I think it was a successful surprise, and it had been a long time since a surprise ending had actually caught people by surprise.\" 2: Psycho - The shower scene (Alfred Hitchcock, US, 1960) Reading on mobile? Click here to watch the scene from Psycho. \"Mary started to scream, and then the curtains parted further and a hand appeared, holding a butcher's knife. It was the knife that, a moment later, cut off her scream. And her head.\" Bang. End of chapter three. The most famous screen murder of all time is over in a flash in Robert Bloch's original novel: three lines, in fact. In Joseph Stefano's screenplay, 'Mary' became Marion, her head stayed mercifully on, and this goreless, staccato passage was transformed by Hitchcock, 'pictorial consultant' Saul Bass, editor George Tomasini and composer Bernard Herrmann into a landmark of postwar cinema and one of the most imitated and parodied sequences ever committed to film. What's more, on a non-academic level, it's as intensely powerful today as it ever was. Famously shot on an $800,000 shoestring in six weeks with a crew from Hitchcock's TV series, Psycho was dismissed by the critics on its release - partly because there were no preview screenings - but it made $15 million in its first year, earned four Oscar nominations and accidentally kickstarted the slasher movie genre (not to mention three mediocre sequels of its own). It has since been listed by the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress, slowed down and turned into an art installation, sent up in The Simpsons and remade, shot for shot, by Gus Van Sant (proving, if nothing else, that colour ruins it). The 45-second shower scene, shot in seven days using 70 separate camera set-ups, is not just the most memorable in the film, it is the plot pivot, the unexpected - and unexpectedly vicious - dispatch of the leading lady (Janet Leigh) halfway through. Indeed, Marion Crane's spontaneous theft of $40,000 from her realtor boss and subsequent paranoid flight from Phoenix is a lengthy MacGuffin - it is her murder by motelier Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) dressed as his dead mother that signals the 'beginning' of the story. As such, the shower is unique in that it can legitimately be viewed and appreciated in isolation as a bravura example of the filmmaker's art, or enjoyed as the narrative masterstroke in a very clever movie. (It's easy to see why Hitchcock banned exhibitors from letting in audiences once Psycho had started.) The trivia of Hitchcock's most celebrated and raked-over scene sometimes threatens to overtake its visual power, but nuggets like these are hard to resist: for instance, Marion could have been played by Eva Marie Saint, Shirley Jones, Lana Turner or Hope Lange. The silhouetted 'Mother' behind the shower curtain was played by Ann Dore (one of five different uncredited actresses responsible for creating Mrs Bates - three for her physical scenes, plus two for her voice, spliced with that of Paul Jasmin, an actor pal of Tony Perkins). The censors demanded the removal of one shot in which they believed Leigh's nipple was visible, but in actual fact, only her head, feet and arms are seen - the rest is stand-in Marli Renfro, a nude model, whose dignity was preserved through judicial use of moleskin patches and glue. The blood that swirls downs the plughole is chocolate sauce, the stabbing sound effects were created by violating a Turkish melon, Janet Leigh postponed the filming twice due to a cold and then her period, and for the final shot of her inert form, she wore contact lenses to create the dilated pupils.Perhaps the scene's biggest talking point down the years has been the contention that graphic supremo Saul Bass, having storyboarded the scene, also directed it. He made this claim himself in 1973, presumably sore that Hitchcock had written his contributions to this and the Arbogast murder scene out of the story. (Bass had not only storyboarded both, he actually shot and assembled a montage to prove that the shower scene would work). However, Janet Leigh has since put the records straight: \"Saul Bass was there for the shooting, but he never directed me.\"Whatever. When Francois Truffaut interviewed Hitchcock in 1962, the director said that his 'main satisfaction' regarding Psycho was that it 'had an effect on the audience' - a desire more than realised by the shower scene's continuing legacy. \"It wasn't a message that stirred the audience,' commented Hitchcock. 'Nor was it a great performance?They were aroused by pure film.\" 3: The Third Man - Harry Lime appears (Carol Reed, UK, 1949) Reading on mobile? Click here to watch the scene from The Third Man. It nearly wasn't him. Noel Coward could have made the most famous entrance in cinema history. Then producer David O. Selznick wanted Robert Mitchum to play legendary racketeer Harry Lime. That particular star put paid to his chances after being arrested and imprisoned for marijuana possession in 1948. So Welles it would be then. Selznick initially resisted the Hollywood maverick: Welles's box-office appeal had slumped disastrously. In reality Welles's appearance was so late in the film his star billing could seem undeserved. He didn't appear in The Third Man until an hour into the film. And even then he didn't speak. Naive American writer, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), was in ravaged post-war Vienna trying to unravel the mystery of his best friend Lime's apparent death. Up to this point moviegoers had been entranced by Reed's noir-ish vision of a city near breakdown. Incidentally, Observer readers found more moments to savour in The Third Man than any other film. Harry Lime's cuckoo clock speech narrowly failed to make it on to the final list. But there was no doubt about the film's most treasured scene. As is often the case, an odd twist of fortune played a part in the circumstances leading to the film's pivotal scene. Characteristically, Welles was less than committed when working for another director. He'd often disappear, trying to raise funds for his Othello adaptation from financiers across Europe. On one occasion he was in Rome while needed on set. In desperation Reed often ordered assistant director Guy Hamilton to take his place so he could shoot an ominous figure running thorough the streets. \"He made me dress up in a big black coat with padded shoulders because I was rather skinny,\" he recalled. Fortunately Welles was around for his most famous close-up. The night scene had been smartly set up. Moments after Lime's former girlfriend, Anna Schmidt, told Martins her cat 'only likes Harry', it had stolen outside and snuggled against the shoes of a mysterious man hiding in a doorway. When a drunk Martins leaves her flat, he is aware of a man on the other side of the street. Martins taunts him: \"Cat got your tongue? Come on out! Come out, come out, whoever you are.\" He rouses an indignant Frau who switches on a light above the door illuminating Lime's face. At the realisation that his plans to disappear have been undone by chance, Lime smiles enigmatically. His face is mischievous, not malicious. The film's villain clearly likes a joke. For all the Third Man's virtues - a British Film Institute poll saw it voted the best British film ever - the scenes with Welles dominate. Whether he is hiding in a doorway or philosophising on a Ferris wheel, Welles is the film's iconic motif. At a time when independent sensibilities seem to be encouraged in Hollywood, Welles is the patron saint of pigheadedness. It's hardly surprising contemporary left-fielder Tim Robbins' latest film The Cradle Will Rock is based on one of Welles's early artistic struggles in the theatre. Welles displayed little humility on the set of The Third Man; he frequently offered directing tips to Reed and rewrote his own lines, improvising the cuckoo clock speech. \"It's true that Orson suddenly produced it while on set,\" says Hamilton. \"Carol said: 'It's a goody, let's use it.'\" On screen, as in life, he cut a larger-than-life figure. A decade later he emerged as a grotesque villain in his own creation Touch of Evil, but in The Third Man he played the most appealing of characters: a charismatic baddie. More Third Man moments and the strange case of Citizen Kane Naturally, many films received votes for more than one moment. Casablanca and Jaws both did themselves no favours in terms of the final list by throwing up so many memorable scenes. Citizen Kane (below) suffered more than any other film from this effect, votes for which were so varied that no one moment made the final 100. (By contrast, the greatest beneficiary was our poll topper, The Usual Suspects which, beyond the winning moment, barely received a mention.) Of our 100, The Third Man elicited the greatest variety. Here's a few of the nearly list. \u2022The final scene. Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) ignores Holly Martins by walking past him after Harry Lime's funeral. \u2022Harry Lime defends himself to Martins on a Ferris wheel ride. \"In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.\" \u2022Orson Welles's hands appear through the grating at street level, grasping the air, after being shot trying to escape the police in the sewers. \u2022A mournful Anna Schmidt lies in bed wearing Harry Lime's pyjamas shortly before a visit from Martins. \u2022A moon-faced boy, holding a ball, shouts at Holly Martins and Anna Schmidt as he chases them away from the murder scene of the vital witness, provoking suspicion from on-lookers that Martins was responsible. 4: 2001: A Space Odyssey - From flying bone to space ship (Stanley Kubrick, UK, 1968) Reading on mobile? Click here to watch the scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Kubrick's beautiful but baffling sci-fi opus billed itself as The Ultimate Trip, spanning many, many thousands of years, from the dawn of man to the first, futuristic steps into space and, with typically Kubrick hubris, 2001 announces this with one simple, majestic cut. Having introduced us to a jabbering community of ape-men, Kubrick reveals a mysterious, coal-black and clearly alien totem that seems to exert a strange influence over this primitive race. Ape-gangs clash, tempers fray, and when their leader thwacks down his club into a pile of bones, he sends them flying into the air - which Kubrick seamlessly matches with a jump-cut that shows a spaceship seeming to follow its graceful trajectory into the starry void of space, accompanied by the triumphant strains of Also Sprach Zarathustra. This wordless leap is typical of Kubrick's open-ended, psychedelic movie: although it lasts some two hours and 20 minutes, there are only 40 minutes of dialogue, and the significance is left to the viewer's imagination. The film's co-creator, Arthur C Clarke, claimed that the film was meant to be unsolvable, going so far as to claim that \"if you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to ask more questions than we posed\". Kubrick was never happy with this explanation and claimed that Clarke was speaking 'facetiously'. However, he did believe in preserving the film's mystery, asking Playboy magazine, \"How much would we appreciate La Gioconda today if Leonardo had written at the bottom of the canvas: 'This lady is smiling slightly because she has rotten teeth' or 'because she's hiding a secret from her lover'? It would shut off the viewer's appreciation and shackle him to a 'reality' other than his own. I don't want that to happen to 2001.\" View from the stalls \"The moment is special because it manages to encompass the entire evolution of the human race in one graceful visual metaphor. The ape has used a weapon for the first time and this sets the course of development that culminates in the nuclear bomb\". Robert West, Oxford 5: Apocalypse Now - Dawn helicopter attack (Francis Ford Coppola, US, 1979) Apocalypse Now was method filmmaking: the film that was as insane as the war itself. And never more so than during the making of the film's showpiece: the scene where insanely gung-ho Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall) and his Air Calvary helicopters swarm out of the dawn light to flatten a Vietcong village, speakers blasting out Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries' as they go (the great film critic Pauline Kael bizarrely tried to dissuade Coppola from using the music on the grounds that it had already been used in a European arthouse movie). Having already set up the hugely expensive scene, Coppola tried to bully the US secretary of defence into providing a lifting helicopter for the scene. The helicopters they did have were borrowed from Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos, and were called away in the middle of the shooting of the scene to be used in a real war against Communist guerrillas. \"We just heard they're taking away five of our helicopters,\" Coppola rages in the documentary Hearts Of Darkness, clearly no longer able to realise he was only making a film about a war. When he did have the choppers, all he could do was complain about the incompetence of the Filipino pilots. But the result is stunning, the craziness and the appeal of war brought together. \"Men play strange games to break up the boredom of being in the war,\" Duvall once said, explaining Kilgore, the man who insists on having his troops surf in the middle of battle. But the real genius of the scene comes not from the grandiose explosions, or even the strange beauty of the attack helicopters, but from some subtle acting: the incredulous expression on Martin Sheen's face as he watches Kilgore in action. 6: Blade Runner - Batty's dying speech in the rain (Ridley Scott, US, 1982) Reading this on mobile? Click here to watch the scene from Blade Runner. \"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tanhauser Gate. All these moments will be lost in time. Like tears in rain. Time to die.\" After Rutger Hauer (Batty) delivered his final soliloquy, the surrounding crew applauded and a few even cried. It wasn't just the replicant's final poignant words that stirred them. Finishing the rain-sodden scene marked the end of an arduous shoot. The exhaustion on Harrison Ford's face as he watches his man-made adversary's demise isn't just acting. He was knackered. Originally Hauer's speech was much longer but the actor persuaded Scott to cut the dialogue saving the audience another protracted death scene. \"His batteries are going. He has no time to say good-bye, except maybe to briefly talk about things he'd seen. 'Life is short' - boom!\" With Scott's permission he cut out the beginning and improvised the last lines. Although Hauer crafted the speech to suit himself, he paid tribute to screenwriter David Peoples for doing 'a really beautiful job'. \"I loved those images he came up with - 'c-beams glittering near the Tanhauser gate, attack ships off the shoulder of Orion'. I thought they were really interesting, even if you didn't understand them.\" 7: The Great Escape - The Cooler King escapes on his motorbike (John Sturges, US, 1963) Reading this on mobile? Click here to watch the scene from the Great Escape. Hot off the back of The Magnificent Seven but basically still a TV actor, Steve McQueen almost turned down The Great Escape (\"I just did two WWII flicks and they both died in the stretch\", he told director Sturges, referring to Hell Is For Heroes and The War Lover). In the end, he took it on the proviso that he was allowed to ride a motorcycle - a typically brattish, macho McQueen demand, but one which sealed his iconic fate, for the climactic two-wheeled leap over a six-foot barbed-wire fence remains the defining image of the film. McQueen, playing loner POW Hilts ('the Cooler King') breaks out of the prisoncompound, steals a motorbike from a German soldier using piano wire across a road, and dons his uniform. It is actually McQueen in the saddle during the resulting chase - in fact, he also doubled for a German soldier in pursuit (\"With exceptional cutting,\" commented Sturges, \"Steve could've played the entire German motorcycle corps\"). The famous jump over the wire was achieved by McQueen's stunt double, long-time pal and bike shop owner Buddy Ekins, on a souped-up Triumph. With the cameras rolling, he cleared it in one take (\"Nothing like that had ever been done before,\" said Ekins). Ironically, the heroic jump does not lead to Hilts' escape - he falls at the next fence - but the scene made McQueen. In Britain, mods and rockers went to see the film over and over again for the jump; they stood up and cheered every time. 8: Casablanca - Rick and Ilsa part at the airport (Michael Curtiz, US, 1942) Reading this on mobile? Click here to watch the scene from Casablanca. By all accounts, it drove Ingrid Bergman (Ilsa) crazy. As scriptwriter Howard Koch recalled, \"The ending of the film was in the air until the very end. We thought of many possibilities and finally decided on the one that was in the film.\" Of course, any other ending would have ruined the film, both as a tragic love story and as a great piece of anti-fascist propaganda. As it was, these were the words Warner Bros's squad of writers cobbled together for Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa to say as they stood on the runway: Rick: Inside of us, we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life. Ilsa: But what about us? Rick: We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night. Ilsa: When I said I would never leave you. Rick: And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going, you can't follow. What I've got to do, you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...

This is one surprise ending that strengthens, rather than undermines, the meaning of what's gone before. It still sends a shiver up the spine - and it rejuvenated the career of Charlton Heston (Taylor), leading to the similarly minded Soylent Green and The Omega Man and making him the most improbable icon for nuke-hating hippies. All the way through the film, stranded astronaut Taylor believes he is on an Earth-like planet. But having escaped into the Forbidden Zone, he comes across a strange object on the beach and as we begin to see it is the Statue Of Liberty, it slowly dawns on Taylor where he is and what has happened: \"You did it, didn't you...You maniacs! You blew it up! Damn you! God damn you all to hell!\" In the original script, Taylor just says 'My God!' Heston claims that he wrote the speech used in the film. But as Heston's diaries record, in 1967 'goddamn' was still banned by the Hollywood Production Code. Fortunately, Heston successfully argued that he was using the expression precisely: \"It's surely acceptable in the context of this speech; Taylor is literally calling on God to damn the destroyers of civilisation.\" It was one of the last stands that old Hollywood morality would make. View from the stalls \"Charlton Heston finds the Statue of Liberty buried in the sand and screams at the sky, 'God damn this world to hell.'

      "bodyText": "Ruud Gullit is poised for a surprise return to English football, as manager at ambitious Fulham. Gullit resigned as Newcastle manager at the end of August after a dreadful start to the Premiership campaign and a public rift with Alan Shearer. Now Gullit, who admitted he was uneasy at being the centre of press attention in a football-crazy provincial city, could return to London where he enjoyed his best times in management with Chelsea between 1996-98. Fulham, who began their First Division campaign under manager Paul Bracewell in fine style, have struggled recently, dropping down the table and going out of both cup competitions. They won yesterday, but Bracewell's future at the club is thought to be in doubt. New PR adviser Max Clifford has dismissed speculation about a move for Eric Cantona but sources in Holland say Gullit has been earmarked for a major role. Fulham are believed to have sounded out the former Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear too, but Mohamed Al-Fayed, the club's owner, wants a high-profile manager and is ready to increase his spending at the club - currently \u00a330 million - to get his man. A respected source in Holland, to where Gullit has returned since leaving Tyneside, told Observer Sport, 'It looks like a serious move. Ruud could be ready to make a move back into the game.' At Craven Cottage, Bracewell's mood is said to be subdued and, according to a senior player, the team are expecting a change. A move for Gullit will need to be persuasive.

It debuted in the 1929 MGM musical The Hollywood Revue and became an instantfavourite, while Arthur Freed, having flourished during the vaudeville era, became a major producer of musicals in the post-sound era.<br>Inspired by MGM's rich back catalogue of film music, Freed commissioned screenwriters Adolph Green and Betty Comden to write a story that would serve as a showcase for some of the better known numbers. After months of brainstorming, Green and Comden came up with the ingenious idea of setting the film in the late 20s - during the transition from silent movies to sound, when many stars fell from grace - and set the benchmark for biting Hollywood satire.</p> <p>Ironically, the keynote scene was anything but joyous for its star: cold-stricken Kelly performed the routine over two days with a fever of 103 degrees, while the rain itself - a blend of water and milk, to make sure it showed on camera - shrank his woollen suit.</p> <h2>12: The Deer Hunter - The prisoners play Russian roulette</h2> <p>(Michael Cimino, US, 1978)</p> <p>The first major Hollywood movie to deal with Vietnam after US withdrawal from the quagmire, Cimino's three-hour, three-act epic is perhaps unhelpfully remembered for the Russian roulette scene - particularly when it is such a central plank in the charge of racism often levelled against the film. But there is no getting away from the scene's brutal power.<br>Michael (Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken) and Stevie (John Savage) are three friends from a Pennsylvania steel town thrown into the heat of the South-East Asian conflict. Imprisoned in a waterlogged, rat-infested bamboo cage behind enemy lines, they are forced to play Russian roulette for the entertainment of various unnamed, unsubtitled Vietcong gamblers. The round in which a near-hysterical Stevie escapes death sets the gruesome, inhuman scene. Then Michael plays against Nick, demanding three bullets are loaded into the revolver ('Now we got ourselves a game,' he pronounces grimly). As the gun-chambers roll, bets are placed, faces are slapped and foreign voices reach fever pitch, Nick cheats death with a click, and the two men turn the tables and escape, after which a nail-biting piece of close-up, emotional cinema turns into a dry-run for Rambo.</p> <p>The scene is much discussed, much copied, but rarely matched for potency of performance. De Niro revealed afterwards how tough it was to play: 'It was hard to sustain that kind of intensity. I mean, we were really slapping each other; you sort of get worked up into a frenzy.' </p> <h2>13: Ben Hur - The chariot race</h2> <p>(William Wyler, US, 1959)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-426767153\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/8/1383922761359/Ben-Hur-006.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Hur\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The chariot race in Ben Hur. Photograph: Moviestore Collection/REX</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though edited by Wyler, the famous chariot race was actually shot by second unit directors Andrew Marton and the legendary Yakima 'Yak' Canutt, one of Hollywood's first stuntmen and known in the industry as the best. Canutt also helped train Charlton Heston in the art of chariot-driving in the month and a half before shooting in Rome; he handpicked the other stunt-riders and horses and oversaw the design of the track. You might say that this great movie moment belongs to Yak.</p> <p>The eight-man race, in which Judah Ben-Hur (Heston) is pitted against arch-enemy Messala (Stephen Boyd), remains one of Hollywood's crowning practical achievements, pulled off without miniatures or process shots, and with 4,000 Italian extras making up the crowd at the Circus of Antioch. In his autobiography In The Arena, Heston denies categorically that any horses - or men - were killed during the race, though the accidents which did occur were not surprising in the circumstances: a camera buried in a pit was struck by a chariot wheel, breaking a horse's leg, and Heston's double was almost killed when a chariot flipped him following a jump (his recovery can be seen in the finished film, cut to Heston climbing back in). Thrilling stuff.</p> <h2>14: Don't Look Now - The hooded figure</h2> <p>(Nicolas Roeg, UK/It, 1973)</p> <p>With its shocking conclusion, Nicolas Roeg's beautifully filmed psychodrama managed a rare coup in modern cinema in that its outcome is both illogical and inevitable.</p> <p>Architectural restorer John Baxter (Donald Sutherland) and his wife Laura (Julie Christie) are taking a holiday in Venice to recover from the traumatic death of their young daughter, who drowned in the family fishpond.

John is sceptical, but a string of coincidences and telepathic flashes suggest otherwise. Finally, he spots a familiar hooded figure - wearing a red plastic mac, like the one his girl died in - darting in and out of the city's walkways. Confronting the apparition, John comes face to face with a hideous, homicidal midget, who stabs him with a kitchen knife, making ominous sense of the weird sisters' prophesy.</p> <p>As in many of Roeg's other films, present, past and future come together in kaleidoscopic editing. Asked recently if he had any pleasant memories of the film, Roeg responded with a telling dismissal of certainty. \"Is memory pleasant?\" he asked. \"I don't know. It's sad and happy, and inevitably there are ups and downs.\" </p> <h2>15: Saving Private Ryan - The Normandy landings</h2> <p>(Steven Spielberg, US, 1998)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OqSg7WO4tT4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-OqSg7WO4tT4\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OqSg7WO4tT4?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"276\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p>After the critically disparaged Jurassic Park sequel The Lost World, people were beginning to wonder if Steven Spielberg wasn't lost himself, somewhere far away in a land of gloopy-eyed sentiment. Even the monochrome intensity of Schindler's List, then his only truly adult movie, couldn't prepare audiences for the 25-minute opening onslaught of Saving Private Ryan, a bleak tribute to the allied forces.</p> <p>Inspired by the real-life case of the Niland brothers, it tells the story of a PR mission during World War II to bring back the only surviving member of the Ryan family, whose brothers have been killed in service. This is just a premise, however, which Spielberg uses to present a glimpse of the real-life horrors of the D-Day landings at Omaha beach. A battle-weary captain (Tom Hanks) is ostensibly the focus, but Spielberg goes all-out to portray the misery, fear and confusion, racking the film to get a jittery newsreel effect, plunging his camera into the muddy water as sniper bullets leave their bloody trails. We haven't met any of the characters yet and Spielberg uses this to maximum effect: no one is safe, everyone is shockingly vulnerable, and we have little idea who is going to survive this apparently unbeatable onslaught.</p> <p>Stunningly filmed by Schindler's List cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, this horrendous scene was stripped of some 60 per cent of its colour, making a sober bookend with the closing scene of the American flag hanging shameful and ragged in the wind.</p> <h2>16: The Birds - The crows gather on the climbing frame</h2> <p>(Alfred Hitchcock, US, 1963)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ydLJtKlVVZw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-ydLJtKlVVZw\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ydLJtKlVVZw?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"276\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p>By the time Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) arrives outside of the Bodega Bay school, we have already seen seagulls attack a children's birthday party, finches have streamed down Rod Taylor's chimney terrifying his family and one of the town's residents has been pecked to death. Hedren has gone to collect Taylor's sister and while she waits for the class to end - the birds seem to know that playtime is about to start - she sits with her back to the playround smoking, oblivious to the massing ranks of crows. Hitchcock used more than 80 camera angles - only a handful of the birds were real - to shoot the scene.</p> <p>The camera lingers on Hedren for what seems an age - we can hear the children singing in the background - and the suspense is maintained with the camera cutting back and forth to the climbing frame as the crows mass. Hedren turns to discover the birds, rushes into the classroom and while the children are being evacuated down the main street the crows attack.</p> <p><strong>Evan Hunter, scriptwriter </strong><br>\"Hitchcock called out of the blue and asked me if I would like to write the screenplay for The Birds. He told me to forget the original Daphne du Maurier story. All he wanted to use was the name and the idea of these birds attacking humans. I had worked on a number of stories for his television series but I didn't know Hitchcock too well when I received the call. We were going after different things. He wanted the film to be artsy and I simply wanted to scare people out of their wits. But he shot this particular scene completely in line with my script. Others were changed as they were shot and the last 10 pages of the script were dropped completely, but this scene was shot as I wrote it. I wanted to get the contrast between the innocence of the children's voices in the background and the malevolence of the birds. We have already seen the birthday party attacked and we know that the birds are dangerous, which goes against all our preconceptions. So when they start to mass we know there will be trouble.\"</p> <p>\"It was beautifully shot to build the audience's apprehension. If there was one thing that I would now change I would not have had Tippi following the final bird as it comes into land - the moment she realises that the birds have massed while she smoked her cigarette. Instead I think she should have simply turned around casually in one movement and been faced by the horror of the sight of the birds.\"</p> <p>Hunter went on to write the screenplay for another Hitchcock movie, 'Marnie', but the two argued and he left before the film was finished. Hunter is perhaps better known as crime writer Ed McBain. His favourite scene from 'The Birds' features Hedren, trapped in a telephone box, being attacked by our feathered friends.</p> <p><strong>Howard Smit, make-up artist</strong><br>\"The images of pecked flesh that came out on that screen came from my imagination. I had never seen anyone pecked and although we researched it we couldn't find any examples, so I had to make it just as I saw it. In those days we were restricted as to the amount of blood we could show. We were trying to make it as realistic as possible and that is, I think, what we achieved. Nothing had been done like this before. It was an important film in make-up terms. The make-up for this scene was not demanding - it was just Tippi's normal beauty make-up. But once the children were under attack as they ran down the street, that is when we got into the action.\"</p> <p><strong>Robert Boyle, production designer</strong><br>\"We had a lot of technical problems. Hitchcock wanted everything planned and so we had to storyboard everything - there was no computer help in those days. Hitchcock wanted Melanie to come out of the school house, sit down, relax, smoke a cigarette, while the audience is aware of the birds gathering. All the time we hold her in a loose shot, very relaxed. For the next shot we move in closer and listen to the children singing off-camera. All the time she sits and the camera moves in a little closer. We, the audience, are aware of the crows, but the tension is mounting, until we move in on a closed shot of Melanie - Hitchcock's instruction was to hold the shot until the audience just can't stand it any longer and then we see the mayhem. The essence of this scene was Hitchcock's vision of a woman sitting, not knowing what was happening, while the audience can see everything and knows the danger.\"</p> <p>Robert Boyle went on to work with Hitchcock on 'Marnie' and his final unfinished film called 'The Short Night'. The climbing frame scene is his favourite from 'The Birds': \"The whole film takes off from there - it is the turning point of the movie.\"</p> <h2>17: Platoon - Sergeant Elias staggers out of the jungle</h2> <p>(Oliver Stone, US, 1986)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mKpQB3bEPbI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-mKpQB3bEPbI\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mKpQB3bEPbI?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"276\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p>Screen legend Mickey Rooney was so distressed after seeing Platoon he said a sign should be placed outside cinemas banning women.</p> <p>While the Eighties are often remembered for Hollywood's Rambo view of US foreign policy, Stone apparently wanted to redress the balance. His trio of overseas conflict films - Platoon, Salvador and Born On The Fourth Of July - painted an unrelenting picture. In Platoon the real enemy is not the Vietnamese but rogue elements within the US forces. The moral battle at the centre of the film pitted saintly Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe) against sociopath-in-uniform Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger). The rookie protagonist Chris, played by Charlie Sheen, has to chose between two conflicting role models. His hand is forced after Barnes shoots Elias, leaving him to die. Barnes tells platoon members Elias has been wounded in action which they accept uneasily. They are subsequently lifted from the area by helicopter. As they leave, Elias is pursued by Vietcong soldiers who shoot him. He falls to the ground, lifting his arms Christ-like.</p> <p>Stone served 15 months in Vietnam, after dropping out of Yale at 21 and enlisting. The naive Chris is based on the director, whose experiences inspired the film. He spent 10 years trying to raise funds for Platoon while writing films such as Midnight Express (1979) and Scarface (1983). </p> <h2>18: Close Encounters Of The Third Kind - The mothership appears</h2> <p>(Steven Spielberg, US, 1977)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-426767154\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/19/close10a.jpg\" alt=\"Close encounters of the third kind, directed by Steven Spielberg (1977)\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Close encounters of the third kind, directed by Steven Spielberg (1977).

His quest has brought him to Devil's Tower, where thousands of others like Neary are drawn without knowing why. A loudspeaker reveals that they are not alone: 'Gentlemen, ladies, take your positions, please. This is not a drill. I repeat: this is not a drill. Could we have the lights in the arena down 60 per cent please? Sixty per cent. I don't think we could ask for a more beautiful evening, do you? OK, watch the skies please. We now show uncorrelated targets approaching from the north northwest.\"</p> <p>A fabulous lightshow follows, as UFO outriders fly down to make contact, followed by the awesome sight of the mothership, which lands to reveal its spectral alien pilots.</p> <p>If it seems like some kind of epic revelation, it was supposed to be - at least in scriptwriter Paul Schrader's original draft, in which Neary was a government official involved in the cover-up of flying saucer activity. \"It came down to this,\" Schrader recalled. \"I said, 'I refuse to send off to another world, as the first example of earth's intelligence, a man who wants to go and set up a McDonald's franchise,' and Steven said, 'That's exactly the guy I want to send.' Steven's Capra-like infatuation with the common man was diametrically opposed to my religious infatuation with the redeeming hero.Steven was right to realise that I was an intractable character and he was right to make the film he was comfortable with.\" </p> <h2>19: Lawrence Of Arabia - The entrance of Sherif Ali</h2> <p>(David Lean, UK, 1962)</p> <p>\"I'm anxious to get a mirage shot. I don't know how the hell we do it, but give it some thought,\" said David Lean to his Oscar-winning cinematographer Freddie Young prior to filming in Jordan. Fortunately, he found a way to show Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) striding majestically out of the desert coming to a standstill between Peter O'Toole and his guide.</p> <p>The technical answer lay in a long 500mm telephoto lens, which allowed him to film the mirage in close-up showing details of the heatwave. A spot in the desert from which mirages were regularly seen was chosen. \"We had him go practically out of sight until he was a little pinpoint in the distance and David told him to ride straight toward the camera,\" recalled Young. Sharif's desert trot lasted 10 minutes; Lean later interpersed the footage with reaction shots from both actors adding a swirling soundtrack to increase the tension. </p> <p>Perfectionist Lean wasn't totally happy with the finished results. \"Originally, I had Omar coming out of the mirage at double the length and it was better,\" he admitted. \"I lost my nerve and cut quite a bit. Wish I hadn't.\" </p> <h2>20: Taxi Driver - 'You talkin' to me?'</h2> <p>(Martin Scorsese, US, 1975)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lQkpes3dgzg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-lQkpes3dgzg\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lQkpes3dgzg?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"276\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p>Becoming increasingly neurotic, New York cab driver Travis Bickle is alone in his seedy apartment, having stocked up on arms to carry out a meaningless plan to assassinate governor Palantine (Leonard Harris).

Then who the hell else are you talkin' to? You talkin' to me? Well, I'm the only one here. Who the fuck do you think you're talkin' to? Oh yeah? Huh?' The gun shoots out of his sleeve. 'Try it, you fuck!'</p> <p>According to screenwriter Paul Schrader, the bulk of De Niro's narration was scripted, although this particular scene was improvised. \"In the script it just says, 'Travis speaks to himself in the mirror.' Bobby [De Niro] asked me what he would say, and I said, 'Well, he's a little kid playing with guns and acting tough.' So De Niro used this rap that an underground New York comedian had been using at the time as the basis for his lines. Because the scene was filmed in one of Manhattan's noisiest areas, Scorsese kept asking De Niro to repeat the line in case the microphone lost it. But it recorded perfectly, and Scorsese kept it all.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "11: Singin' In The Rain - Gene Kelly does just that (Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, US, 1952) When the lovestruck Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) sang and danced in the rain, twirling his umbrella, skeetering in and out of the gutter until the suspicious glare of a Hollywood policeman finally dampened his ardour, the song was already some 30 years old. It debuted in the 1929 MGM musical The Hollywood Revue and became an instantfavourite, while Arthur Freed, having flourished during the vaudeville era, became a major producer of musicals in the post-sound era. Inspired by MGM's rich back catalogue of film music, Freed commissioned screenwriters Adolph Green and Betty Comden to write a story that would serve as a showcase for some of the better known numbers. After months of brainstorming, Green and Comden came up with the ingenious idea of setting the film in the late 20s - during the transition from silent movies to sound, when many stars fell from grace - and set the benchmark for biting Hollywood satire. Ironically, the keynote scene was anything but joyous for its star: cold-stricken Kelly performed the routine over two days with a fever of 103 degrees, while the rain itself - a blend of water and milk, to make sure it showed on camera - shrank his woollen suit. 12: The Deer Hunter - The prisoners play Russian roulette (Michael Cimino, US, 1978) The first major Hollywood movie to deal with Vietnam after US withdrawal from the quagmire, Cimino's three-hour, three-act epic is perhaps unhelpfully remembered for the Russian roulette scene - particularly when it is such a central plank in the charge of racism often levelled against the film. But there is no getting away from the scene's brutal power. Michael (Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken) and Stevie (John Savage) are three friends from a Pennsylvania steel town thrown into the heat of the South-East Asian conflict. Imprisoned in a waterlogged, rat-infested bamboo cage behind enemy lines, they are forced to play Russian roulette for the entertainment of various unnamed, unsubtitled Vietcong gamblers. The round in which a near-hysterical Stevie escapes death sets the gruesome, inhuman scene. Then Michael plays against Nick, demanding three bullets are loaded into the revolver ('Now we got ourselves a game,' he pronounces grimly). As the gun-chambers roll, bets are placed, faces are slapped and foreign voices reach fever pitch, Nick cheats death with a click, and the two men turn the tables and escape, after which a nail-biting piece of close-up, emotional cinema turns into a dry-run for Rambo. The scene is much discussed, much copied, but rarely matched for potency of performance. De Niro revealed afterwards how tough it was to play: 'It was hard to sustain that kind of intensity. I mean, we were really slapping each other; you sort of get worked up into a frenzy.' 13: Ben Hur - The chariot race (William Wyler, US, 1959) Though edited by Wyler, the famous chariot race was actually shot by second unit directors Andrew Marton and the legendary Yakima 'Yak' Canutt, one of Hollywood's first stuntmen and known in the industry as the best. Canutt also helped train Charlton Heston in the art of chariot-driving in the month and a half before shooting in Rome; he handpicked the other stunt-riders and horses and oversaw the design of the track. You might say that this great movie moment belongs to Yak. The eight-man race, in which Judah Ben-Hur (Heston) is pitted against arch-enemy Messala (Stephen Boyd), remains one of Hollywood's crowning practical achievements, pulled off without miniatures or process shots, and with 4,000 Italian extras making up the crowd at the Circus of Antioch. In his autobiography In The Arena, Heston denies categorically that any horses - or men - were killed during the race, though the accidents which did occur were not surprising in the circumstances: a camera buried in a pit was struck by a chariot wheel, breaking a horse's leg, and Heston's double was almost killed when a chariot flipped him following a jump (his recovery can be seen in the finished film, cut to Heston climbing back in). Thrilling stuff. 14: Don't Look Now - The hooded figure (Nicolas Roeg, UK/It, 1973) With its shocking conclusion, Nicolas Roeg's beautifully filmed psychodrama managed a rare coup in modern cinema in that its outcome is both illogical and inevitable. Architectural restorer John Baxter (Donald Sutherland) and his wife Laura (Julie Christie) are taking a holiday in Venice to recover from the traumatic death of their young daughter, who drowned in the family fishpond. They meet a pair of sisters, one with psychic powers, and Laura becomes obsessed with the idea that their child will one day return to them. John is sceptical, but a string of coincidences and telepathic flashes suggest otherwise. Finally, he spots a familiar hooded figure - wearing a red plastic mac, like the one his girl died in - darting in and out of the city's walkways. Confronting the apparition, John comes face to face with a hideous, homicidal midget, who stabs him with a kitchen knife, making ominous sense of the weird sisters' prophesy. As in many of Roeg's other films, present, past and future come together in kaleidoscopic editing. Asked recently if he had any pleasant memories of the film, Roeg responded with a telling dismissal of certainty. \"Is memory pleasant?\" he asked. \"I don't know. It's sad and happy, and inevitably there are ups and downs.\" 15: Saving Private Ryan - The Normandy landings (Steven Spielberg, US, 1998) After the critically disparaged Jurassic Park sequel The Lost World, people were beginning to wonder if Steven Spielberg wasn't lost himself, somewhere far away in a land of gloopy-eyed sentiment. Even the monochrome intensity of Schindler's List, then his only truly adult movie, couldn't prepare audiences for the 25-minute opening onslaught of Saving Private Ryan, a bleak tribute to the allied forces. Inspired by the real-life case of the Niland brothers, it tells the story of a PR mission during World War II to bring back the only surviving member of the Ryan family, whose brothers have been killed in service. This is just a premise, however, which Spielberg uses to present a glimpse of the real-life horrors of the D-Day landings at Omaha beach. A battle-weary captain (Tom Hanks) is ostensibly the focus, but Spielberg goes all-out to portray the misery, fear and confusion, racking the film to get a jittery newsreel effect, plunging his camera into the muddy water as sniper bullets leave their bloody trails. We haven't met any of the characters yet and Spielberg uses this to maximum effect: no one is safe, everyone is shockingly vulnerable, and we have little idea who is going to survive this apparently unbeatable onslaught. Stunningly filmed by Schindler's List cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, this horrendous scene was stripped of some 60 per cent of its colour, making a sober bookend with the closing scene of the American flag hanging shameful and ragged in the wind. 16: The Birds - The crows gather on the climbing frame (Alfred Hitchcock, US, 1963) By the time Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) arrives outside of the Bodega Bay school, we have already seen seagulls attack a children's birthday party, finches have streamed down Rod Taylor's chimney terrifying his family and one of the town's residents has been pecked to death. Hedren has gone to collect Taylor's sister and while she waits for the class to end - the birds seem to know that playtime is about to start - she sits with her back to the playround smoking, oblivious to the massing ranks of crows. Hitchcock used more than 80 camera angles - only a handful of the birds were real - to shoot the scene. The camera lingers on Hedren for what seems an age - we can hear the children singing in the background - and the suspense is maintained with the camera cutting back and forth to the climbing frame as the crows mass. Hedren turns to discover the birds, rushes into the classroom and while the children are being evacuated down the main street the crows attack.

Instead I think she should have simply turned around casually in one movement and been faced by the horror of the sight of the birds.\" Hunter went on to write the screenplay for another Hitchcock movie, 'Marnie', but the two argued and he left before the film was finished.

Fortunately, he found a way to show Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) striding majestically out of the desert coming to a standstill between Peter O'Toole and his guide. The technical answer lay in a long 500mm telephoto lens, which allowed him to film the mirage in close-up showing details of the heatwave. A spot in the desert from which mirages were regularly seen was chosen. \"We had him go practically out of sight until he was a little pinpoint in the distance and David told him to ride straight toward the camera,\" recalled Young. Sharif's desert trot lasted 10 minutes; Lean later interpersed the footage with reaction shots from both actors adding a swirling soundtrack to increase the tension. Perfectionist Lean wasn't totally happy with the finished results. \"Originally, I had Omar coming out of the mirage at double the length and it was better,\" he admitted. \"I lost my nerve and cut quite a bit. Wish I hadn't.\" 20: Taxi Driver - 'You talkin' to me?' (Martin Scorsese, US, 1975) Becoming increasingly neurotic, New York cab driver Travis Bickle is alone in his seedy apartment, having stocked up on arms to carry out a meaningless plan to assassinate governor Palantine (Leonard Harris). He's wearing a combat jacket and addressing the mirror, but his words are delivered straight to camera. 'You talkin' to me?' he snarls. 'You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? Then who the hell else are you talkin' to? You talkin' to me? Well, I'm the only one here. Who the fuck do you think you're talkin' to? Oh yeah? Huh?' The gun shoots out of his sleeve. 'Try it, you fuck!' According to screenwriter Paul Schrader, the bulk of De Niro's narration was scripted, although this particular scene was improvised. \"In the script it just says, 'Travis speaks to himself in the mirror.' Bobby [De Niro] asked me what he would say, and I said, 'Well, he's a little kid playing with guns and acting tough.' So De Niro used this rap that an underground New York comedian had been using at the time as the basis for his lines. Because the scene was filmed in one of Manhattan's noisiest areas, Scorsese kept asking De Niro to repeat the line in case the microphone lost it. But it recorded perfectly, and Scorsese kept it all.\"",

      "bodyText": "Tottenham players are not ideal men to be around when there is lightning cracking down from the Chelsea area. The poor scorched souls keep coming back for more, but this was the 22nd successive game in which they have failed to beat Chelsea and they must be feeling the heat by now. Even their White Hart Lane stadium could not escape the pain as it took a whack from the Chelsea team bus as it attempted to transport the victorious players out of the Tottenham car park. This latest meeting, just three weeks on from Chelsea's victory at Stamford Bridge by the same scoreline, was settled by an instinctive attack of flair and imagination from Dennis Wise, who laid on the only goal of the game for stand-in defender Bernard Lambourde. Tottenham's defence may have suffered from a collective bout of narcolepsy as the Frenchman strolled in to score, but the praise for Wise's quick thinking should out weigh any recriminations for the home side's ability to fall asleep at a second's notice. Overall, Chelsea deserved the win which leaves them fifth in the Premiership table and avoided the embarrassment of seeing Tottenham over take them had they lost. Chelsea, having shaded a first half in which it took two fine saves by Ian Walker to keep the score level, won the game seven minutes into the second half when Sol Campbell conceded a free-kick for a foul on Chris Sutton. As Walker arranged his defensive wall, Wise quickly flicked the ball over the static line of defenders in front of him and Lambourde ghosted in unchallenged from the right to loop the ball over a stunned and motionless Tottenham keeper. Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli said: 'The free-kick was not rehearsed. The players have a guide, but sometimes it is down to their imagination and Wise showed great imagination and invention to set it all up.' George Graham, naturally, saw it differently yet remained positive. 'The goal was very, very bad from our point of view,' he said. 'Now we have to keep plugging away and I think we have proved we are as good as Chelsea. Twice we have played them in three weeks and we have proved there is nothing between them and us.' Graham clearly had gained strength from the way Tottenham responded to Lambourde's goal as Darren Anderton went close and Steffen Iversen forced two excellent saves from Ed De Goey. Unfortunately, for the Norwegian striker, he aggravated a back injury in his final attempt on goal and left the arena on a stretcher and will have a scan to assess the damage tomorrow . If Tottenham had been so incisive in the first half they might have nicked more from this game than their fourth home defeat of the season. After Walker had denied George Weah with a stunning one-handed save after only five minutes, Tottenham had chances to score through Chris Armstong and Anderton. But both missed the target and De Goey was only really tested in the Chelsea goal when Tottenham were vainly chasing the match. Tottenham, as they had to amid a run of just two wins from their 12 previous games, stood their ground at a time when their confidence could have been at its most fragile. Rather than let Chelsea launch into their attacking showboat style, they harried and chased, getting in tackles at every opportunity. But it was Chelsea who always seemed to have a touch more invention about them and that is what ultimately separated the teams. As Graham concluded: 'We were probably stronger in the second half and came back well, but Chelsea have that extra bit of quality when needed.'",

After the game Wilson could not hide his disappointment at the way his side lost a two-goal lead in the last minute. 'We should never have conceded the goals in the way we did,' he said. 'We should have the three points and not be sitting here talking about earning just one.' After the game Derby's manager, Jim Smith, still looked in shock as he could not believe his side had picked up a point after being 3-1 down in the last minute. 'We had to go for it at the end, put pressure on Wednesday and we finally got the reward. Great credit to the boys. We kept on going forward and we got the breaks.'",

Which makes sense: there's hardly any dialogue, understandable for a film where the director didn't speak the same language as his stars. But what Leone could do was take the Western showdown to a point of delirious excess. The film ends with the gunmen - Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach - standing in the middle of a vast cemetery. Leone focuses in turn on their guns, then their faces, then their hands, editing faster the whole time, before closing in on the chillingly cold eyes of Van Cleef and Eastwood and then - finally - Eastwood shoots Van Cleef, who topples into an open grave. Ennio Morricone had already written his incredible, fantastically exciting score for the film, and the ending was shot -some claim- and edited -certainly- to the music, rather than the music having to fit an existing film. Most of the people who worked with Leone said he was an unpleasant and hugely shallow man. But with a camera and an editing suite, he was among the best.</p> <h2>22: The Shawshank Redemption - The escape hole is discovered</h2> <p>(Frank Darabont, US, 1994)</p> <p>Feelgood movies arrive in all shapes and sizes, but arguably no other movie in the Nineties inspired as much affection and critical acclaim as The Shawshank Redemption. In a decade defined by cinema's increasing ability to dazzle using effects, this prison-set parable arrived as a welcome throwback. As director Darabont explains, \"It says something positive about human nature\". The friendship between urbane, wrongly convicted Tim Robbins and worldly wise Morgan Freeman provides the film's most touching moments. But when it comes to memorable moments, few things can match a good old-fashioned jailbreak. When Robbins seemingly vanishes from his cell overnight, prison guards and audience alike are confused. The answer lies behind the poster of Raquel Welch. Over several decades, Robbins has painstakingly carved out his escape route using a small rock hammer. </p> <h2>23: Alien - The birth of the alien</h2> <p>(Ridley Scott, UK/US, 1970)</p> <p>Sometime in the dirty, distant future, the spacecraft Nostromo is making its way back to Earth after visiting an apparently dead planet. Crew member Kane (John Hurt) is the only casualty, having inspected one of a legion of egg-shaped vessels and been rathergraphically assaulted by its contents - a skeletal, fist-like creature that attached itself to his face and throat. Mysteriously, the creature seems to have died and removed itself and Kane is apparently fit and well, sitting at the dinner table with the others. With his first forkful he starts retching and suddenly he's on his back. Seconds later, a tiny, eel-like alien erupts from his stomach, spattering the appalled crew with blood. But although folklore now insists that director Ridley Scott didn't tell his cast what was going to happen, this isn't strictly true. \"The rest of the cast knew the scene was about the birth of the alien,\" according to Hurt, \"but they didn't know exactly what was going to happen.\"<br>Or as Scott put it: \"If an actor's just acting terrified you don't get that genuine look of raw animal fear. What I wanted was a hardcore reaction, and I thought it best to give the actors an edge by not familiarising them with what was going to happen.\"</p> <h2>24: Dirty Harry - 'Do you feel lucky punk?' </h2> <p>(Don Siegel, US, 1971)</p> <p>'Dirty' Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) appears at the scene of a foiled bank robbery. Casually eating a hot dog, he takes out his gun and blows away the scattering felons until only one remains. He grunts, 'Uh-huh. I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, I forgot myself in all this excitement. But being as this is the .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and could blow your head clean off, you have to ask yourself one question, \"Do I feel lucky?\" Well, do you, punk?'<br>This classic scene is repeated at the end of the movie, when Callahan, now at the end of his tether, corners Scorpio, a serial killer who has been terrorising San Francisco, in a quarry in Marin County. This time, however, there is one crucial difference. Through gritted teeth, Callahan repeats his speech - although this time he assures Scorpio that the .44 Magnum will blow his head clean off. This scene marked Eastwood's transition from mythic spaghetti western hero to gritty urban tough guy.</p> <p><strong>View from the stalls</strong><br>\"'This is a Magnum.44, the most powerful handgun in the world? so, are you feeling lucky punk?' - a speech that every man would have loved to deliver, though some would deny it.\" Adrian Hewitt, Devon</p> <h2>25: One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest - Chief Bromden escapes</h2> <p>(Milos Forman, US, 1975)</p> <p>\"One critic said that he never believed that such a good film could be made out of such a bad book. Another said that he never believed that such a bad film could be made out of such a good book.\" So said Milos Forman. It took 13 years for Ken Kesey's 1962 novel to make it to the big screen. The book had been immediately optioned by Kirk Douglas, who later passed on the rights to his son Michael after failing to make the film. Douglas Jr managed to interest Jack Nicholson and raise the $3m budget. Filming took place at the Oregon State Hospital. Many psychiatric inmates actually appeared in the film since its director Dr Dean R. Brooks thought the experience would prove therapeutic. To help his actors the Czech-born director picked a \"model patient for every character in the movie and told each actor to track his model, to watch how he walked, talked, moved.\"</p> <p>Before shooting began Forman had lived in the nurses' quarters for three weeks enjoying unlimited access to every ward. After hiring Jack Nicholson as rebellious McMurphy, Forman took meticulous care with the lesser parts, auditioning 900 actors for the other inmates. Will Sampson played Chief Bromden in his first screen role, the result of Forman's tireless search for a giant American Indian actor. Sampson's undoubted career highlight occurred when he picked up a previously immovable water fountain, using it to smash a window and flee. Earlier he had suffocated hopelessly lobotomised McMurphy.</p> <p>The director originally intended the Chief's symbolic escape to be the film's final scene, before deciding it was too ambiguous after viewing a rough cut. He asked for more money and shot two extra days showing the inmates awakening to the consequences of the Chief's action. That wasn't the only breakout during filming. After a crew member left a window open, a patient jumped out backwards, falling three floors and fracturing his shoulder. The local paper's headline ran: One Flew Out Of The Cuckoo's Nest.</p> <h2>26: Raiders Of The Lost Ark - Indiana shoots the swordsman</h2> <p>(Steven Spielberg, US, 1981)</p> <p>In a sweltering bazaar, American archaeologist Indiana Jones is making his getaway from the Nazi-paid henchmen trying to stop him in his quest to find the lost Ark of the Covenant. An enormous, turbaned assassin steps up to confront him, giving an awesome display of swordplay as he flashes a huge scimitar with grim dexterity. Indiana's face goes through four seasons of expression: surprise, realisation, terror, panic - and then suddenly he remembers the gun in his pocket. Pulling it out, he calmly shoots his enemy dead and hurries on his way.</p> <p>According to lore, the scene itself was just as pragmatic. Rather than take on a lot of difficult choreography and face a whole raft of retakes in the blistering sun, Ford asked if he couldn't just shoot the guy. The crew laughed and, fortunately for Ford, so did Spielberg, who immediately amended the script. Interestingly, Spielberg never thought the film would amount to anything more than a B-movie when he first came up with the idea during a Hawaiian holiday with his friend George Lucas, who was trying to avoid publicity after the surprise success of Star Wars. As a measure of how serious they were, the hero was named after Lucas's dog.</p> <p>\"I didn't see it as anything more than a better-made version of the Republic serials [of the Forties],\" is Spielberg's line. </p> <h2>27: The Full Monty - The dole queue dance</h2> <p>(Peter Cattaneo, UK, 1997)</p> <p>The events in The Full Monty might be a bit improbable, but no more unlikely than the events transforming a tired idea for a TV drama into the (then) biggest British film ever.</p> <p>There are plenty of reasons why it rose above its origins - and has never been matched by its dismal imitators - but start with the acting and a script that stresses the men's desperation as much as the knock-about comedy. And then there are the small moments of genius, like the dole queue scene. It's surprisingly short: Dave (Mark Addy), Lomper (Steve Huison), Guy (Hugo Speer), Horse (Paul Barber) and Gerald (Tom Wilkinson) are all standing in one line; Gaz (Robert Carlyle) is in another. Donna Summer's 'Hot Stuff' comes on the radio, and Gaz starts nodding his head. Then Guy and Lomper start coyly moving to the beat. Horse and Dave are dancing more obviously, Then a space opens up in front of Gerald, and he tries a spin, before realising what he's done and bowing his head. The others look sheepish, but Gaz is grinning broadly.</p> <p>And that's it: Cattaneo resisted the urge to stretch the scene, or have the DSS staff join in, or anything that would make it cheaper. And even the choice of music has a poignancy, according to Mark Addy. \"The reason Peter Cattaneo chose to use Seventies disco is because he wanted it to be the kind of music the characters were listening to when they were growing up, when they had prospects. You were maybe doing an apprenticeship or whatever when Donna Summer was playing. It's stuff that's from a better time.\"</p> <h2>28: Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid - The final, doomed shootout</h2> <p>(George Roy Hill, US, 1969)</p> <p>\"Endings, frankly, are a bitch,\" concluded legendary screenwriter William Goldman, but at least once he got it exactly right. Having annoyed the US authorities a little too much with their impudent bank robbing, Butch (Paul Newman) and Sundance (Robert Redford) have run off to Bolivia. Even the rare studio executives who liked Goldman's whimsical script didn't see why the outlaws couldn't make their final stand in the USA. Goldman's argument - that they should end up in Bolivia because that's what had happened in real life - didn't go down well, but he stood his ground. So Butch and Sundance are spotted in a tiny Bolivian village and start a gunfight with the local police. Bleeding, sweating and still bickering, they hide out waiting for a chance to break out.</p> <p>Butch: I got a great idea where we should go next.<br>Sundance: I don't want to hear it.<br>Butch: You'll change your mind when I tell ya.<br>Sundance: Shut up.</p> <p>While they argue about going to Australia, a whole battalion of Bolivian troops has arrived. We watch hundreds of men take up firing positions all over the little town.</p> <p>Butch: Wait a minute - you didn't see LaForce out there, did you?<br>Sundance: LaForce? No, why?<br>Butch: Thank God for that. For a moment there I thought we were in trouble.</p> <p>They run out into the square, guns blazing. The picture freezes, and slowly fades back to the sepia tones the film starts with. Unlike their cinematic contemporaries Bonnie and Clyde, we never see them riddled with bullets. Instead we get both a truthful, doomed ending - and are left a heroic poster shot.</p> <p>No doubt Ridley Scott kept it in mind when making Thelma And Louise.</p> <p>View from the stalls<br>\"It's one of those rare occasions where Hollywood allows itself to put a downbeat ending on a buddy movie. But it works because it's the right ending and because it looks as classy as hell.\" Andrew Clarke , London</p> <h2>29: North By Northwest - The crop-dusting plane</h2> <p>(Alfred Hitchcock, US, 1959)</p> <p>You can do things differently if you're Hitchcock. When the great director sat down to create what would eventually become North By Northwest with screenwriter Ernest Lehman, he had no idea what would emerge. They had neither plot nor character in mind. \"We'll talk about it and we'll come up with something,\" he confidently told Lehman. Luckily Hitchcock was inspired by an idea given to him by a journalist at a cocktail party: a secret government agency creates a non-existent decoy to throw its enemies off the scent. Within that framework, he wanted to play around with striking locations (Mount Rushmore) and different ways to menace his hapless protagonist. When Grant is attacked by the low-flying plane, after being lured to a desolate prairie crossing, it's the third attempt on his life - but the most vicious. The urbane urbanite is completely out of his depth, vulnerable to foes almost comical in their ingenuity and frightening power. A classic Hitchcock moment.</p> <h2>30: Seven - What's in the box?</h2> <p>(David Fincher, US, 1995)</p> <p>Detectives Mills (Brad Pitt) and Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have finally apprehended the killer responsible for some of the sickest crimes ever, all committed in disgust at the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, pride, sloth and lust. But the mysterious John Doe (Kevin Spacey) has a surprise for them - there are two more bodies, supposedly out in the marshland, and they head out to find them.</p> <p>Mills: Where we headed?<br>John Doe: You'll see.<br>Mills: We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny? That wouldn't be? shocking enough. Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.<br>Doe: Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder. You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.<br>Mills: What makes you so special that people should pay attention?<br>Doe: Not me. I'm not special. I'm not exceptional. This is, though - what I'm doing.<br>Mills: I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.<br>Doe: You know that's not true.<br>Mills: In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.<br>Doe: You can't see the whole? the whole complete act yet. Not yet. But, when this is done, it's going to be?so?so?<br>Mills: Spit it out.<br>Doe: It's going to be flawless. People will barely be able to comprehend it. It will seem almost surreal?but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it. I can't wait for you to see. I can't wait?It's really going to be something.<br>Mills: Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done. Wouldn't want to miss it.<br>Doe: Oh, don't worry. You won't?</p> <p>Minutes later, a courier appears with a gruesome special delivery. Doe finally checks off envy and wrath.</p> <p><strong>View from the stalls</strong><br>\"My third visit to a screening of this startling movie was motivated by the prospect of seeing again the dramatic effect this moment can have on an already rattled audience. Glorious stuff!\" Alan Crump, Middlesex</p>",

Mills: What makes you so special that people should pay attention? Doe: Not me. I'm not special. I'm not exceptional. This is, though - what I'm doing. Mills: I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours. Doe: You know that's not true. Mills: In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened. Doe: You can't see the whole? the whole complete act yet. Not yet. But, when this is done, it's going to be?so?so? Mills: Spit it out. Doe: It's going to be flawless. People will barely be able to comprehend it. It will seem almost surreal?but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it. I can't wait for you to see. I can't wait?It's really going to be something. Mills: Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done. Wouldn't want to miss it. Doe: Oh, don't worry. You won't? Minutes later, a courier appears with a gruesome special delivery. Doe finally checks off envy and wrath. View from the stalls \"My third visit to a screening of this startling movie was motivated by the prospect of seeing again the dramatic effect this moment can have on an already rattled audience. Glorious stuff!\" Alan Crump, Middlesex",

      "body": "<p>As relentless and predictable as the Manchester rain, United took another significant step towards retaining their Premiership title with a nonchalance that should cause growing alarm among the pretenders to their crown. </p> <p>A title contest that at one stage promised to generate more plot twists than the London Mayoral race is in danger of becoming United's private three-month procession towards yet more silverware.</p> <p>By the time United return their attentions to matters European on 1 March - nine days after they visit Leeds in the League - the destination of the title could be effectively over.</p> <p>Leeds manager David O'Leary had hopefully suggested that the Elland Road encounter should be re-arranged for the final day of the season as a potential winner-take-all title decider. That contest may yet see the de facto crowning of kings, only three months earlier than O'Leary had planned.</p> <p>Possibly the most alarming feature of a victory that took United six points clear of Leeds and nine above Arsenal was the fact that the reigning champions turned in one of their most disappointing performances for some time.</p> <p>'It's been a good day for us,' concluded Sir Alex Ferguson on analysing defeats for his closest rivals. 'But I wasn't over-enamoured with our performance. We produced some fantastic moments of football, but they were sporadic.'</p> <p>'What concerns me now, and what we will guard against, is complacency. You never win anything with that.'</p> <p>Certainly many of the fantastic moments referred to by his manager came from Andy Cole, one of four players recalled to the side as Ferguson employed the luxury enjoyed by only the true elite - rotating his squad.</p> <p>With Dwight Yorke due for international duty with Trinidad and Tobago, the burden of scoring responsibility has fallen on Cole. He did not disappoint.</p> <p>In the 39th minute, Gary Neville's cross allowed Teddy Sheringham and Cole to link, the latter switching ball from left to right foot, taking defender Gary Breen out of the equation, and floating a delightful dipping shot into the top left-hand corner.</p> <p>Nine minutes into the second half, the contest was all but decided courtesy of Cole's seventeenth goal of the season. It was a painfully simple set-piece header, all the more so because moments before the same striker had cleared the bar with a header from an identical position.</p> <p>David Beckham won a right-wing free-kick after a foul by Froggatt. He took it himself, delivering a flawless cross for Cole to convert with a close-range header.</p> <p>Coventry dispelled any notion of a capitulation. John Eustace had his run and shot ended by Jaap Stam's challenge before the ball broke to the unmarked Cedric Roussel, who finished competently and confidently with a shot into the roof of the net 25 minutes from time.</p> <p>Yet it did not take United long to respond - 11 minutes to be precise - Sheringham's header falling to the feet of Paul Scholes whose 25-yard drive would probably still have gone in without the aid of keeper Magnus Hedman's slip.</p> <p>Roussel's second goal in the 90th minute, impressively converted, was simply cosmetic although Gordon Strachan had every right to be pleased with his side's effort. 'I'd imagine United will win the League again,' said Strachan. 'I'm afraid it's not an original statement, and after all I have said, that will be the headline tomorrow!'</p>",

      "bodyText": "As relentless and predictable as the Manchester rain, United took another significant step towards retaining their Premiership title with a nonchalance that should cause growing alarm among the pretenders to their crown. A title contest that at one stage promised to generate more plot twists than the London Mayoral race is in danger of becoming United's private three-month procession towards yet more silverware. By the time United return their attentions to matters European on 1 March - nine days after they visit Leeds in the League - the destination of the title could be effectively over. Leeds manager David O'Leary had hopefully suggested that the Elland Road encounter should be re-arranged for the final day of the season as a potential winner-take-all title decider. That contest may yet see the de facto crowning of kings, only three months earlier than O'Leary had planned. Possibly the most alarming feature of a victory that took United six points clear of Leeds and nine above Arsenal was the fact that the reigning champions turned in one of their most disappointing performances for some time. 'It's been a good day for us,' concluded Sir Alex Ferguson on analysing defeats for his closest rivals. 'But I wasn't over-enamoured with our performance. We produced some fantastic moments of football, but they were sporadic.' 'What concerns me now, and what we will guard against, is complacency. You never win anything with that.' Certainly many of the fantastic moments referred to by his manager came from Andy Cole, one of four players recalled to the side as Ferguson employed the luxury enjoyed by only the true elite - rotating his squad. With Dwight Yorke due for international duty with Trinidad and Tobago, the burden of scoring responsibility has fallen on Cole. He did not disappoint. In the 39th minute, Gary Neville's cross allowed Teddy Sheringham and Cole to link, the latter switching ball from left to right foot, taking defender Gary Breen out of the equation, and floating a delightful dipping shot into the top left-hand corner. Nine minutes into the second half, the contest was all but decided courtesy of Cole's seventeenth goal of the season. It was a painfully simple set-piece header, all the more so because moments before the same striker had cleared the bar with a header from an identical position. David Beckham won a right-wing free-kick after a foul by Froggatt. He took it himself, delivering a flawless cross for Cole to convert with a close-range header. Coventry dispelled any notion of a capitulation. John Eustace had his run and shot ended by Jaap Stam's challenge before the ball broke to the unmarked Cedric Roussel, who finished competently and confidently with a shot into the roof of the net 25 minutes from time. Yet it did not take United long to respond - 11 minutes to be precise - Sheringham's header falling to the feet of Paul Scholes whose 25-yard drive would probably still have gone in without the aid of keeper Magnus Hedman's slip. Roussel's second goal in the 90th minute, impressively converted, was simply cosmetic although Gordon Strachan had every right to be pleased with his side's effort. 'I'd imagine United will win the League again,' said Strachan. 'I'm afraid it's not an original statement, and after all I have said, that will be the headline tomorrow!'",

Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are those who say that it exemplifies everything that's dismal about our uptight country or that it sums up what's wrong with our filmmaking. And there are those who simply can't cope with those bizarre clipped accents now only used by the Royal Family. But Observer readers are clearly still brought to tears by Coward and Lean's most English story of doomed love. Laura (Celia Johnson) and Alec (Trevor Howard) part twice, in fact: once at the start of the film, and then at the end. But of course, they're never allowed a big tearful farewell on the platform. As they are treasuring their final minutes together, Laura's garrulous friend Dolly (Everley Gregg) sits down and starts talking and - being a polite English adulterous couple - they can't tell her to get lost. So their last words to each other are:<br>Alec: I must go.<br>Laura: Yes, you must. (He puts his hand lightly on her shoulder, then leaves.)<br>Dolly: He'll have to run or he'll miss it. Talking of missing trains reminds me...</p> <p>And that's it: no overt passion, no declarations, just a lot of repressed pain that tempts Laura into thinking she wants to throw herself in front of the express. But she doesn't: Brief Encounter is a film where life goes on, painfully. And that resonates even in our post-Diana, jackets-off Britain.</p> <h2>32: Gone With The Wind - 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn'</h2> <p>(Victor Fleming, US, 1939)</p> <p>Ten writers, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, toiled on this epic script. The dialogue that caused them the most trouble was Rhett Butler's classic one-liner. Before the film, audiences familiar with Margaret Mitchell's Civil War bestseller placed bets on whether the line would be allowed by Hollywood's draconian censors. The Hays' Commission, a self-regulatory body, had a list of 11 'don'ts' and 25 'be carefuls'. These guidelines were known as the Motion Picture Production Code and lasted until the Sixties. 'Damn' was forbidden but it had slipped past the censors on a couple of occasions previously, notably Pygmalion (1933) when both Leslie Howard and Marie Lohr used it. With such a high-profile film, the Hays' Commission was anxious to set an example.<br>Eventually the film's producer, the legendary David O. Selznick pleaded: \"The word as used in the picture is not an oath or a curse. The omission gives an impression of unfaithfulness after three hours and forty-five minutes of extreme fidelity to Miss Mitchell's work.\" Selznick was fined $5,000; but the sentence stayed in the picture.</p> <h2>33: Kes - Brian Glover's football lesson</h2> <p>(Ken Loach, UK, 1969)</p> <p>Ken Loach has always injected laughs into his social realism. None have been funnier than the chaotic schoolboy football match organised by Brian Glover in Kes. The PE teacher and fanatical Manchester United fan bullies opposition players and, as a partisan referee, he awards himself the dodgiest of penalties. The scene was actually shot at teacher-turned-novelist Barry Hines's old school in Barnsley. He had met Glover while teaching at another school, stayed in contact, and suggested he audition. \"The football came directly from Barry's novel,\" recalls Loach. \"But Brian Glover was a real find and he made the film so memorable.\" A keen footballer, David Bradley, the film's adolescent hero Billy Casper, does not have such fond memories from filming the scene. \"They had a local fire engine flood the field. Although it was August, it was bloody freezing.\"</p> <h2>34: On The Waterfront - 'I coulda been a contender'</h2> <p>(Elia Kazan, US, 1954)</p> <p>Arthur Miller was originally set to be the scriptwriter for On The Waterfront. However, he refused to work with Kazan, who co-operated with the House Un-American Activities Committee during the anti-Communist witchhunts. The key scene takes place when smalltime boxer and dockworker Terry Malloy confronts his mobster brother, Charlie.</p> <p>Terry: Remember that night in the [Madison Square] Garden you came down to my dressing room and you said, 'Kid, this ain't your night. We're going for the price on Wilson.' You remember that? 'This ain't your night!' My night! I coulda taken Wilson apart! So what happens? He gets the title shot outdoors on the ballpark and what do I get? A one-way ticket to Palookaville! You was my brother, Charley, you shoulda looked out for me a little bit. You shoulda taken care of me just a little bit so I wouldn't have to take them dives for the short-end money.<br>Charley: Oh, I had some bets down for you. You saw some money.<br>Terry Malloy: You don't understand. I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charley. </p> <h2>35: Pulp Fiction - Vincent shoots Marvin</h2> <p>(Quentin Tarantino, US, 1994)</p> <p>Here's the reason people worry about Quentin Tarantino: easily the funniest moment in Pulp Fiction happens when a harmless character gets his head blown off. It's a measure of Tarantino's talent that he can make it so funny, and perhaps a measure of his moral compass that he should choose to do so.<br>Marvin (Phil LaMarr) is sitting in the back of the car as Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) argue about the 'miracle' that has left them unscathed after being shot at near point blank range. Jules announces he's going to retire.</p> <p>Exasperated, Vincent - still holding his gun - swivels in his seat and addresses Marvin, who has been keeping quiet in the back.</p> <p>'Marvin, what do you make of all this?'<br>'I don't even have an opinion.'<br>'You gotta have an opinion: do you think that God came down from heaven and...' Right in the middle of his sentence, just when we - and he - least expect it, Vincent's gun flashes. His shirt is splattered with blood.<br>'Oh man,' he says ruefully, strangely boyishly, 'I shot Marvin in the face...'</p> <p>And that's just the start of a string of comic moments that are all based on poor Marvin's grisly death. You will laugh - even if you're feeling queasy at the same time.</p> <h2>36: The Shining - 'Heeeeeeeeeere's Johnny!'</h2> <p>(Stanley Kubrick, UK, 1980)</p> <p>After Barry Lyndon, Stanley Kubrick's quest to find another project was long and difficult. His assistant claimed to have heard the thump of manuscripts hitting the wall night after night - until one night there was silence. The book was Stephen King's The Shining, sent by John Calley, Warner Bros' head of production. It was the story of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), who takes a job as a janitor in the snowbound Overlook Hotel, where he plans to write the great American novel.</p> <p>Instead, he sinks into dementia, which Kubrick suggests at first is psychological - \"asked Jack to remember the characters you see lunging down the streets of New York, waving their arms about and hissing\"- before laying on the supernatural shocks.</p> <p>Surprisingly for Kubrick, the most famous scene was actually ad-libbed; terrorising his catatonic wife, who is hiding in the bathroom, Jack smashes through the door with an axe and mimics the opening line to the Johnny Carson show: 'Heeeeeeere's Johnny!' Kubrick was full of praise for his star, saying, \" believe that Jack is one of the best actors in Hollywood, perhaps on a par with the greatest stars of the past like Spencer Tracy and Jimmy Cagney. His work is always interesting, clearly conceived and has magic. Jack is particularly suited for roles which require intelligence. He is an intelligent and literate man, and these are almost impossible to act. In The Shining, you believe he's a writer, failed or otherwise.\"</p> <h2>37: True Romance - 'You're Sicilian, ha?'</h2> <p>(Tony Scott, US, 1994)</p> <p>Only in a movie written by Quentin Tarantino, complained critics, would you get Dennis Hopper playing the nice guy. Hopper is Clifford Worley, an alcoholic ex-cop. Christopher Walken is Vincenzo Coccotti, a mobster who arrives at Clifford's trailer wanting to know the whereabouts of Clifford's son. After Clifford has been repeatedly punched, then has his hand slashed open by one of Coccotti's henchman (James 'Tony Soprano' Gandolfini), he is still smiling at Coccotti.</p> <p>Clifford: You're Sicilian, ha? Ya know, I read a lot. Especially about things... about history. I find that shit fascinating. Here's a fact I don't know whether you know or not. Sicilians were spawned by niggers.<br>Coccotti [twitching, very slowly taking in what Clifford has just said]: Come again?<br>Clifford Worley: It's a fact. See, Sicilians have black blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me you can look it up. Hundreds of years ago, you see, the Moors conquered Sicily. And the Moors are niggers.<br>Coccotti: Yes...<br>Clifford: Way back then, Sicilians were like wops from northern Italy. They all had blonde hair and blue eyes, but then the Moors moved in there, and they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with Sicilian women that they changed the whole bloodline forever. That's why blonde hair and blue eyes became black hair and dark skin. It's amazing to me to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, that Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. It's written, it's a fact, it's written. <br>Coccotti: [laughing, and signalling to his henchmen to laugh along] I love this guy.<br>Clifford: Your ancestors are niggers. Yeah, and your great-great-great-great grandmother fucked a nigger, yeah, and she had a half nigger kid...Now, if that's a fact, tell me, am I lying? Cause you, you're part eggplant.<br>Coccotti [still laughing]: You're a cantaloupe.</p> <p>He gets up, kisses Clifford's head, collects a gun and unloads six bullets into his head.</p> <p><strong>View from the stalls</strong><br>\"When the dreaded 'N'word got its first airing there was deathly silence. As the exchange progressed there was a palpable atmosphere of disapproval. I let loose a not inconsiderable guffaw. About 200 outraged eyes drilled into the back of my head.\" Stuart Barr, Edinburgh.</p> <h2>38: E.T. The Extraterrestrial - E.T. and Elliot ride a bike against the moon</h2> <p>(Steven Spielberg, US, 1982)</p> <p>\"It truly was a religious experience. It must be a little bit like people feel if they feel they've seen God.\" (Universal Studios Chief Executive Sid Sheinberg speaking in 1988.)</p> <p>Perhaps it's difficult to imagine today, but in 1982 E.T. did become a quasi-religious experience for many moviegoers across the world. More than just a runaway hit, E.T. touched millions in an apparently profound way. The film attracted children of all ages willing to bypass the outer cynic to reach the inner child. In the US, the phenomenon reached startling proportions: moviegoers queued for hours to see the film, often not for the first time. Bumper stickers urged 'E.T. Phone Home!' Neil Diamond recorded a hit song, the cloying 'Turn on Your Heart Light'. Most importantly for Hollywood, merchandise flew out of the stores.</p> <p>Many observers noted that the film looked as if it had been directed by a child. The camera angles were low, offering a child's eye view. The adults were flawed: Elliot's mum was sympathetic but oblivious to her offspring's bizarre behaviour, his dad was in Mexico with his 'new girlfriend'. Amazingly, the film was banned in Sweden for under-11s since it showed parents in a poor light.</p> <h2>39: Goodfellas - 'What do you mean funny?'</h2> <p>(Martin Scorsese, US, 1990)</p> <p>The Godfather movies exposed the high end of the mafia command, but Scorsese's Goodfellas paid close attention to the foot soldiers, showing a life mired in violence, casual and otherwise. Scorsese offered little sociological explanation for their actions: gangsters are gangsters because the pay is good and perks even better. Furthermore there's plenty of humour; little wonder the film caused the US ratings board such a headache.<br>In this extract psychotic Tommy (Joe Pesci), after regaling fellow crew members with a story, takes offence after Henry (Ray Liotta) says he is 'funny'.</p> <p>Tommy: Funny, how?<br>Henry: Just?<br>Tommy: What?<br>Henry: Just, you know, you're - you're funny. (Chuckles) So?<br>Tommy: You mean, let me understand this, I'm a little fucked up, maybe. But, I'm funny, how? I mean, funny like I'm a clown? I amuse you? I make you laugh. I'm here to fucking amuse you. What do you mean funny? Funny, how? How am I funny?<br>Henry: Come on, just, you know, how you tell a story. What?<br>Tommy: No, no, I don't know. You said I'm funny. How the fuck am I funny? What the fuck is so funny about me? Tell me. Tell me what's so funny. (For a moment, Henry looks very uncertain)<br>Henry: Get the fuck outta here, Tommy<br>(Everyone begins laughing again. The tension is defused.) </p> <h2>40: Spartacus - I'm Spartacus!'</h2> <p>(Stanley Kubrick, US, 1960)</p> <p>Just as dozens of favourite movie quotes are misremembered, so some great scenes don't happen quite when you think they do. The most famous scene in Spartacus should be the climax to the movie, the rousing note on which to leave Kirk Douglas's army of warrior slaves. It's not: there's plenty more of this vast film to come. But none of it beats the bit when the Romans promise to spare the defeated slaves from crucifixion if they identify Spartacus. A weary looking Spartacus (Douglas) starts to stand up. Then Antoninus (Tony Curtis) jumps up beside him and shouts 'I'm Spartacus!' Immediately, the slave on Spartacus's right yells 'I'm Spartacus!' Almost instantly, the valley is filled with men crying, 'I'm Spartacus!' A tear runs down Spartacus's cheek.<br>Kubrick, who regarded making the film as the low point of his career, went on to parody this scene. 'No, I'm Spartacus,' Peter Sellers says in Lolita. Who said Kubrick didn't have a sense of humour?</p>",

Many observers noted that the film looked as if it had been directed by a child. The camera angles were low, offering a child's eye view. The adults were flawed: Elliot's mum was sympathetic but oblivious to her offspring's bizarre behaviour, his dad was in Mexico with his 'new girlfriend'. Amazingly, the film was banned in Sweden for under-11s since it showed parents in a poor light. 39: Goodfellas - 'What do you mean funny?' (Martin Scorsese, US, 1990) The Godfather movies exposed the high end of the mafia command, but Scorsese's Goodfellas paid close attention to the foot soldiers, showing a life mired in violence, casual and otherwise. Scorsese offered little sociological explanation for their actions: gangsters are gangsters because the pay is good and perks even better. Furthermore there's plenty of humour; little wonder the film caused the US ratings board such a headache. In this extract psychotic Tommy (Joe Pesci), after regaling fellow crew members with a story, takes offence after Henry (Ray Liotta) says he is 'funny'. Tommy: Funny, how? Henry: Just? Tommy: What? Henry: Just, you know, you're - you're funny. (Chuckles) So? Tommy: You mean, let me understand this, I'm a little fucked up, maybe. But, I'm funny, how? I mean, funny like I'm a clown? I amuse you? I make you laugh. I'm here to fucking amuse you. What do you mean funny? Funny, how? How am I funny? Henry: Come on, just, you know, how you tell a story. What? Tommy: No, no, I don't know. You said I'm funny. How the fuck am I funny? What the fuck is so funny about me? Tell me. Tell me what's so funny. (For a moment, Henry looks very uncertain) Henry: Get the fuck outta here, Tommy (Everyone begins laughing again. The tension is defused.) 40: Spartacus - I'm Spartacus!' (Stanley Kubrick, US, 1960) Just as dozens of favourite movie quotes are misremembered, so some great scenes don't happen quite when you think they do. The most famous scene in Spartacus should be the climax to the movie, the rousing note on which to leave Kirk Douglas's army of warrior slaves. It's not: there's plenty more of this vast film to come. But none of it beats the bit when the Romans promise to spare the defeated slaves from crucifixion if they identify Spartacus. A weary looking Spartacus (Douglas) starts to stand up. Then Antoninus (Tony Curtis) jumps up beside him and shouts 'I'm Spartacus!' Immediately, the slave on Spartacus's right yells 'I'm Spartacus!' Almost instantly, the valley is filled with men crying, 'I'm Spartacus!' A tear runs down Spartacus's cheek. Kubrick, who regarded making the film as the low point of his career, went on to parody this scene. 'No, I'm Spartacus,' Peter Sellers says in Lolita. Who said Kubrick didn't have a sense of humour?",

Michael Caine plays the laconic Charlie Croker, a British lag who hears of a business deal between the Italian and Chinese governments, involving $4m in gold bullion. Croker enlists the aid of Mr Bridger (Noel Coward), a renowned mob boss who controls his underworld empire from his luxury jail cell, and then heads off to Turin to intercept the delivery.</p> <p>Everything about this movie is memorable except the direction; the colour-coded Minis that make the getaway, the chase through Turin's sewers (filmed in the Midlands) and Caine's barking admonition to an explosives expert who completely destroys an empty delivery van during a test run ('You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!').</p> <p>But most memorable of all is the ending, in which the gangsters, cocky with excitement, skid dangerously on a cliffside road and leave the back end of the getaway bus balancing precariously over the edge. Immediately they face a dilemma: if they jump out, they'll lose the bullion, but if they go after the bullion, they'll go down with the bus - which is exactly where the camera leaves them.</p> <p>In fact, real life mirrored their predicament, and there were stuntmen frantically holding on to the front of the bus, to counteract the downdraft from the helicopter used to get the closing shot.</p> <h2>42: The Wizard Of Oz - The journey to Oz</h2> <p>(Victor Fleming, US, 1939)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-426770195\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/4/1349346571042/Judy-Garland-wears-the-ru-010.jpg\" alt=\"Judy Garland wears the ruby slippers in The Wizard of Oz\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judy Garland wears the ruby slippers in The Wizard of Oz.

After running away from home with her dog Toto to escape the wrath of local busybody, Elvira Gulch, Dorothy (Judy Garland) meets a travelling salesman. He gently reminds her of the people back home, her kindly Auntie Em in particular, but when she guiltily makes her way home, a hurricane sweeps her away before she can make it to the storm shelter. Hiding in her room, Dorothy watches, terrified, as the house rises high into the air. As debris flies past, the scene becomes more and more surreal until Elvira Gulch, on her matronly bicycle, is transformed into a cackling witch. There's a crash, and when Dorothy comes round, she's in an outlandish, full-colour fantasy world.</p> <p>'Toto,' she says, 'I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.'</p> <p>And significantly for a film that takes place in two worlds, The Wizard Of Oz was the work of several directors. After Richard Thorpe spent two weeks on the project, this lavish adaptation of the children's classic was supposedly passed to George Cukor, who worked on it for just two days before it landed with Victor Fleming. Fleming filmed the lavish new three-colour Technicolor process (superimposing negatives sensitive to blue as well as the previous red and green) before handing over to King Vidor, who filmed the mournful, monochrome wraparound scenes.</p> <h2>43: Jaws - The opening</h2> <p>(Steven Spielberg, US, 1975)</p> <p>You can tell a good idea by the number of people who claim to have had it. Veteran editor Verna Fields got an Oscar for her work on Jaws, but allegedly Steven Spielberg was so annoyed by assumptions that Fields had saved Jaws by keeping the shark off screen as long as possible that he changed his mind about using her on Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. But according to scriptwriter Carl Gottlieb, Spielberg made the decision, although they all were thinking along the same lines. \"Early on, one of our models was The Thing, a great horror picture where you don't see the creature until the last reel.\"<br>So instead of an actual shark, the menace comes from John Williams's music. The opening credits introduce the ominous cello motif, speeding up as the shark's-eye camera races along the seabed. Then we're on the beach, with the tanned blond kids round a camp fire, all ready to become so much shark fodder. One perfect Aryan couple sneak off to go skinnydipping. The girl goes into the water first, swimming out serenely. Then we're under water, from the shark's point-of-view, looking at the girl's legs, and then she's screaming, being dragged across the surface before disappearing. We're terrified and we've learnt - almost instantly - what that music means.</p> <p><strong>View from the stalls</strong><br>\"The scene builds on the basic human fear of the unknown, and of being punctured. It captures it perfectly. I have never been in the sea and not thought of that film.\" Mr C. Kania, Cheshire</p> <h2>44: Now Voyager - Two cigarettes, one light</h2> <p>(Irving Rapper, US, 1942)</p> <p>Director Irving Rapper, who came to Hollywood in the early Thirties as a dialogue coach, was never one of cinema's greatest stylists but he had a good ear for an unforgettable line.</p> <p>Now Voyager tells the story of a neurotic Boston society woman, Charlotte Vale (Bette Davis), who shocks her repressed family when she shows signs of a nervous breakdown. She is sent to see Dr Jaquith (Claude Rains), who prescribes a cruise, where Charlotte, now full of confidence and reinvented as a woman of the world, falls in love with Jerry (Paul Henreid). The affair is doomed, since Jerry is married and has a child (an introverted little thing with whom Charlotte clearly identifies), but her independence allows her to accept the fact that Jerry can never leave them.</p> <p>In the climactic scene, Jerry lights two cigarettes and passes one to Charlotte, then starts trying to find a way to solve this impossible situation. 'Oh Jerry,' she tells him firmly, looking up at the night sky, 'don't let's ask for the moon when we have the stars.' </p> <h2>45: Star Wars - Destruction of the Death Star</h2> <p>(George Lucas, US, 1977)</p> <p>Star Wars' structural and thematic similarities to a classic western have been much stated, but the climactic airborne destruction of the Death Star owes more to WWII movies like The Dambusters and to the James Bond blueprint, in which the villain's secret base is blown up.</p> <p>Heroic farmboy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) joins the X-Wing rebel attack from their base on the fourth moon of Yavin, while the Death Star moves ominously into range to destroy it. 'This will be a day long remembered,' intones Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones), with 30 minutes to launch.</p> <p>Heralded as 'the best pilot in the outer rim territories', Luke ('Red Five') gradually moves up the ranks as other rebels are downed by imperial Tie Fighters. The X-Wings fly down a narrow trench, aiming to hit a two-metre-wide thermal exhaust port, whose shaft leads to the Death Star's main reactor. With Vader himself in pursuit ('The Force is strong with this one'), it becomes clear that Luke is the rebels' only chance.He is advised telepathically by Jedi guru Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) to 'let go' of his ship's computer guidance system and use the Force to find his target. As John Williams' score builds, Luke fires, seconds before the Death Star launches. Ker-boom! It bursts into an industrial light and magic supernova. 'Great shot, kid!' says Han Solo (Harrison Ford). 'That was one in a million.'</p> <h2>46: The Crying Game - Fergus discovers Dil's true gender</h2> <p>(Neil Jordan, UK, 1992)</p> <p>Stanley Kubrick said it couldn't be done. He thought the role of transvestite singer Dil was virtually uncastable. He was proved wrong when Derek Jarman tipped off the production team about Jaye Davidson, a former fabric designer with no previous acting experience. Davidson later said he only took the role to pay for an expensive pair of handmade leather riding boots. Casting an unknown with an androgynous name meant his real gender remained a surprise to audiences. The sudden d\u00e9nouement of the tentative romance between Fergus (Stephen Rea) and Dil (Davidson) was one of cinema's great surprises. Crucially, film journalists had been sworn to secrecy and the majority of filmgoers failed to guess that Dil was actually a man.</p> <p>Not everyone was impressed by Jordan's ingenuity, though. 'Will Jordan's trap door of surprise become a pitfall of disgust?' sniffed one critic. While the film's release coincided with the renewal of the IRA's mainline campaign, causing some concern over the sympathetic portrait of Rea's former terrorist. The film wasn't a big hit domestically, but in the US, plot twist and content were well received by audiences and critics alike. Jordan won an Oscar for his screenplay, but The Crying Game lost the Best Picture award to another film which condemned violence: Clint Eastwood's revisionist western, Unforgiven.</p> <h2>47: The Producers - The chorus sing 'Springtime For Hitler'</h2> <p>(Mel Brooks, US, 1968)</p> <p>\"I think most of my movies are serious; they have their roots in some terrible things,\" Mel Brooks has explained. \"I mean, 'Springtime For Hitler' is, in some oblique, insane way, my response to Nazi Germany, but what you see is a romp with Bialystock and Bloom.\"</p> <p>And what a romp. Based on an absurdist premise: an accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) and theatrical producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) decide to put on a play so awful, they will lose their investors' money yet make a killing out of the insurance payments. For their flop they chose a musical written by a Nazi apologist Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars) - Springtime For Hitler: A Musical Romp With Adolf And Eva. The eponymous song's lyrics include: 'Don't be stupid, be smarty. Come and join the Nazi party.'</p> <p>Not surprisingly, Hollywood kept the project at arms length. One executive promised Brooks the money for his directorial debut if he changed the musical title to Springtime For Mussolini. 'Nazi movies are out,' he was told. Eventually independent producer Joseph E. Levine backed him after the major studios had turned The Producers down. But the first-timer found more problems on set, especially on his first day surrounded by an eager cast and crew. \"The cameras were rolling, the director is supposed to say 'Action!' But, being a little nervous, I say 'CUT!' Everything stops. They all looked at me.\"</p> <h2>48: When Harry Met Sally - The fake orgasm</h2> <p>(Rob Reiner, US, 1989)</p> <p>It's one of those times when you can see a whole career made in a few seconds. We're in a New York deli, and Sally (Meg Ryan) is trying gently to suggest to Harry (Billy Crystal) that he might not be the lover he thinks he is:<br>Harry: What are you saying, that they fake orgasm?<br>Sally: It's possible.<br>Harry: Get outta here!<br>Sally: Why? Most women at one time or another have faked it.<br>Harry: Well, they haven't faked it with me.<br>Sally: How do you know?<br>Harry: Because I know.<br>Sally: Oh, right, that's right, I forgot, you're a man.<br>Harry: What is that supposed to mean?<br>Sally: Nothing. It's just that all men are sure it never happened to them, and that most women at one time or another have done it, so you do the math.<br>Harry: You don't think that I could tell the difference?<br>Sally: No.<br>Harry: Get outta here?which is when Sally starts panting, softly at first, then building up to a wild, table-banging climax as Harry looks on in panic.</p> <p>As Sally smiles triumphantly, perfectly composed, another customer (played by Rob Reiner's mother, Estelle) says: 'I'll have what she's having.' According to Ryan, it was Crystal who came up with the perfect punchline.</p> <p>The scene has had an unusual afterlife: avant-garde rock group The Flaming Lips used Ryan's moans as part of their Boombox Experiment, in which 40 members of the audience became a ghetto blaster orchestra.</p> <h2>49: A Few Good Men - 'You can't handle the truth'</h2> <p>(Rob Reiner, US, 1992)</p> <p>Adapted from his own hit Broadway play, Aaron Sorkin's searing look at institutionalised corruption and abuse within the US Marine Corps hinges very much on the power of its words. On screen, the glamorous cast (Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Jack Nicholson, Kevin Bacon, Keifer Sutherland) initially proves distracting from the meat of the story, but once we arrive in the courtroom, where two Marines face court martial for murdering a 'substandard' recruit, the script takes centre stage, and Cruise, as the cocky Navy lawyer Kaffee, rises to the occasion.</p> <p>Cross-questioning Nicholson's monolithic Colonel Nathan R. Jessep, the trial becomes a head-to-head battle between rule book and barrack-room law, as Cruise beats an admission from Nicholson that he ordered a 'Code Red' (the internal Marine punishment that went wrong). It's Grisham with epaulettes.</p> <p>'You snotty little bastard,' snarls the colonel, signalling the collapse of the wall of silence. 'You want answers?'<br>'I think I'm entitled!' responds Kaffee.<br>'You want answers?' Jessep's sap is rising.<br>'I want the truth!'<br>'You can't handle the truth!'</p> <p>The erudite, blood'n'honour speech from Jessep that follows may not be the sort that even a seasoned veteran could pull out of the hat in real life, but Nicholson delivers every line as a broadside ('You want me on that wall, you need me on that wall'). To think he had to wait until As Good As It Gets for his next Oscar.</p> <h2>50: A Matter Of Life And Death - 'There's a catch...'</h2> <p>(Michael Powell, UK, 1946)</p> <p>We're in a burning British bomber plane, with a fantastically vivid red-orange fire burning behind the pilot's shoulder. He doesn't seem to notice: he maintains a terrifying gentlemanly cheerfulness throughout the scene. He's played - of course - by David Niven and is nominally calling for help, although he seems to be talking to himself.</p> <p>'Age: 27 - 27 you get that - that's very important. Education: interrupted, violently interrupted. Religion: Church Of England. Politics: Conservative by nature, Labour by experience. What's your name?'<br>'Cannot read you?' says the confused American WAC (Kim Hunter), but it seems to be her attitude rather than the crackling transmission that's making communication difficult.<br>'\"And at my back I always hear / Time's wing'd chariot hurrying near / And yonder all before us lie / Deserts of vast eternity.\" Andy Marvell, what a marvel. What's your name?'<br>'What's your position?' she asks. The camera stays tight on each of them as they speak.<br>'You seem like a nice girl. I can't give you my position. Instruments gone. Crew gone too. Except Bob, my sparks: he's dead. The rest of them bailed out on my orders?they'll be sorry about Bob. We all liked him...Take a telegram to my mother. Tell her that I love her, you'll have to write this for me, but what I want her to know is that I have loved her very much. I've never shown her, not really?'<br>'Are you wounded? Are you bailing out?'<br>'What's your name?'<br>'June.'<br>'Yes, June, I'm bailing out, but there's a catch: I've got no parachute?'</p> <p>This would be a great way to end a film, but it's an even better way to begin one. And it works both as a parody and celebration of absurd Englishness under pressure, in a film that was commissioned by the Ministry of Information to improve Anglo-American relations.</p>",

Sally: Oh, right, that's right, I forgot, you're a man. Harry: What is that supposed to mean? Sally: Nothing. It's just that all men are sure it never happened to them, and that most women at one time or another have done it, so you do the math. Harry: You don't think that I could tell the difference? Sally: No. Harry: Get outta here?which is when Sally starts panting, softly at first, then building up to a wild, table-banging climax as Harry looks on in panic. As Sally smiles triumphantly, perfectly composed, another customer (played by Rob Reiner's mother, Estelle) says: 'I'll have what she's having.' According to Ryan, it was Crystal who came up with the perfect punchline. The scene has had an unusual afterlife: avant-garde rock group The Flaming Lips used Ryan's moans as part of their Boombox Experiment, in which 40 members of the audience became a ghetto blaster orchestra. 49: A Few Good Men - 'You can't handle the truth' (Rob Reiner, US, 1992) Adapted from his own hit Broadway play, Aaron Sorkin's searing look at institutionalised corruption and abuse within the US Marine Corps hinges very much on the power of its words. On screen, the glamorous cast (Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Jack Nicholson, Kevin Bacon, Keifer Sutherland) initially proves distracting from the meat of the story, but once we arrive in the courtroom, where two Marines face court martial for murdering a 'substandard' recruit, the script takes centre stage, and Cruise, as the cocky Navy lawyer Kaffee, rises to the occasion. Cross-questioning Nicholson's monolithic Colonel Nathan R. Jessep, the trial becomes a head-to-head battle between rule book and barrack-room law, as Cruise beats an admission from Nicholson that he ordered a 'Code Red' (the internal Marine punishment that went wrong). It's Grisham with epaulettes. 'You snotty little bastard,' snarls the colonel, signalling the collapse of the wall of silence. 'You want answers?' 'I think I'm entitled!' responds Kaffee. 'You want answers?' Jessep's sap is rising. 'I want the truth!' 'You can't handle the truth!' The erudite, blood'n'honour speech from Jessep that follows may not be the sort that even a seasoned veteran could pull out of the hat in real life, but Nicholson delivers every line as a broadside ('You want me on that wall, you need me on that wall'). To think he had to wait until As Good As It Gets for his next Oscar. 50: A Matter Of Life And Death - 'There's a catch...' (Michael Powell, UK, 1946) We're in a burning British bomber plane, with a fantastically vivid red-orange fire burning behind the pilot's shoulder. He doesn't seem to notice: he maintains a terrifying gentlemanly cheerfulness throughout the scene. He's played - of course - by David Niven and is nominally calling for help, although he seems to be talking to himself. 'Age: 27 - 27 you get that - that's very important. Education: interrupted, violently interrupted. Religion: Church Of England. Politics: Conservative by nature, Labour by experience. What's your name?' 'Cannot read you?' says the confused American WAC (Kim Hunter), but it seems to be her attitude rather than the crackling transmission that's making communication difficult. '\"And at my back I always hear / Time's wing'd chariot hurrying near / And yonder all before us lie / Deserts of vast eternity.\" Andy Marvell, what a marvel. What's your name?' 'What's your position?' she asks. The camera stays tight on each of them as they speak. 'You seem like a nice girl. I can't give you my position. Instruments gone. Crew gone too. Except Bob, my sparks: he's dead. The rest of them bailed out on my orders?they'll be sorry about Bob. We all liked him...Take a telegram to my mother. Tell her that I love her, you'll have to write this for me, but what I want her to know is that I have loved her very much. I've never shown her, not really?' 'Are you wounded? Are you bailing out?' 'What's your name?' 'June.' 'Yes, June, I'm bailing out, but there's a catch: I've got no parachute?' This would be a great way to end a film, but it's an even better way to begin one. And it works both as a parody and celebration of absurd Englishness under pressure, in a film that was commissioned by the Ministry of Information to improve Anglo-American relations.",

Sadly for Keith Hellawell, the spin machine had not yet finished its cycle.</p> <p>Before an audience of 100 teachers and drug workers in a motel on the outskirts of Gloucester last week, the former Chief Constable of West Yorkshire announced the recruitment of 680 new drug workers. \u00a3500,000 of government money has been put aside for the recruitment drive,' Hellawell said. And training will be given. I can't say yet what form the training will take, but it will be paid for out of the seized asset fund.'</p> <p>He said the same announcement was being made simultaneously by Cabinet Office Minister Mo Mowlam, to whom he reports. At that moment Mowlam was appearing on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, but she seemed to have other things on her mind. While passing reference to the recruitment drive was made, she used the broadcast instead for something more pungent: an attack on elements in Whitehall which, she said, 'were trying to put the knife in' by briefing journalists that her brain tumour illness had left her unable to do her job.</p> <p>Mowlam's assault on her detractors was widely reported the next day. The announcement about the recruitment of new drug workers was ignored.</p> <p>Once again Hellawell had seen significant progress in his war on drugs obscured by fallout from the Whitehall spin machine. Mowlam is well known to be less than fond of Hellawell, whom she is said to regard as being 'too Chief Constable'. She has more time for his deputy, Mike Trace, who comes from the world of field work with addicts. But Hellawell is more likely to see it simply as part of a growing problem he has in getting his message across. He has been derided for allegedly suggesting that the Government should consider buying Afghanistan's entire opium crop to stop it getting on to the streets as heroin.</p> <p>He has been lambasted for apparently suggesting the Internet is encouraging drug use among young people and criticised for failings in pilot drug treatment schemes he has introduced.</p> <p>He will also know that the support he has expressed in today's Observer for the 'depenalisation' of the possession of cannabis - a recommendation of a forthcoming report by the Police Foundation - will prove controversial.</p> <p>He is irritated by the way he is portrayed in the media. 'I do get cross when I read about what I have or haven't done, said or haven't said,' he said. 'The spin machine looks like it's trying to pin a tail on the donkey with its eyes shut. They've found me and decided I'm going to be the target of derision.'</p> <p>Yet he still does not feel he can afford to ignore the hacks. In Gloucester he spent 20 minutes talking to the drug workers who had travelled from all over the country for a conference on drug use among young people with special needs. But he gave the smattering of journalists present almost two hours .</p> <p>'We're actually doing everything we said we would do and doing it on time,' he told them. 'People from other countries have seen what we're doing in Britain and they say they don't understand the stick I'm getting. At the United Nations congress on drug use in 1998 I was given a full session to present our programme to 190 nations. Even General Barry Mcaffrey, who's heading up the American drug programme, was surprised at the speed with which we've got everything going.' </p> <p>He launches into a list of successes: the reduction in criminality among offenders who have been part of referral schemes for treatment, the introduction of drug-free wings in some prisons, the small reductions that have been seen in the numbers of people saying they have ever tried drugs. But mostly he wants to talk about the turnaround in official attitudes to the problem of drugs.</p> <p>'Successive Conservative governments stated that the solution to the drug problem lay with the criminal justice system,' he said. 'Now funds are being shifted into treatment and education.' Hence the need for 680 new drug workers: the agencies implementing drug treatment and education policy have the money to do the job, he said, they just don't have the bodies to do it. Now that problem would be solved.</p> <p>He has, he says, managed to get more than \u00a3250 million of new money out of the Treasury to fight his war. His list of achievements is indeed impressive, but there are still problems. More than 50 per cent of offenders issued with Drug Treatment and Testing Orders, one of Hellawell's pet projects, piloted in three areas so far, have returned to using drugs.</p> <p>'Yes,' he says, 'but the general level of criminality and drug spending among them has dropped.'</p> <p>There are also increases in the use of cocaine. This, he admits, is a cause for grave concern. 'In the last British Crime Survey covering 1996-98 we saw an increase of cocaine use from 1 per cent to 3 per cent among the 15-29 age group, mostly around the club scene in London, Liverpool and Nottingham. This is a threefold increase.</p> <p>'In the next two years we are going to see a further increase. It's becoming cheaper and more socially acceptable. Clearly this is bad news for someone like me in this job.' But, he insists, the important issue is to look at drug policy as a whole.</p> <p>'What I have done is lift the stone on the hidden truth about drugs in Britain, which is that we need to discriminate between different drugs and the relative harm caused and then talk openly about the difference we can make. The focus is going to be on the drugs that cause the major harm.'</p> <p>This means accepting that cannabis use - and even the recreational use of Ecstasy and amphetamines - is a low priority and that resources should instead be concentrated on narcotics such as like heroin and cocaine.</p> <p>The problem is that to talk of such things is seen by Labour to be politically dangerous, hence the ridiculing of Clare Short when she said it might be worth considering decriminalising marijuana and the backlash Mowlam experienced when she admitted having inhaled.</p> <p>Tony Blair once said his party would 'campaign in poetry but govern in prose'. The reality is less romantic. New Labour campaigns in thick black headlines, which is exactly what it did to sell the idea of its war on drugs during the 1997 election.</p> <p>'I believe we need to appoint a figurehead in the battle,' he told a roomfull of fifth-formers who could not vote for him, during a speech at Dyce Academy in Aberdeen in April 1997. 'Today I am announcing that Labour will appoint an anti-drugs supremo, what they call in America a drugs tsar, to co-ordinate our approach.'</p> <p>Ever since Hellawell landed the job he has been trying to shake the title, dismissing it as creating a simplistic image of a problem being tackled through force alone. He says he has been given licence to think creatively about the problem. He also says he has received endless support from the Cabinet for his 10-year plan to shift the bulk of the \u00a31.5 billion of government money earmarked for dealing with drug issues from the criminal justice system to treatment and education.</p> <p>But he has been told nothing in the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act is up for negotiation.

His mantra from his days as a copper has been that anything that might encourage more people to take more drugs, however soft, is a bad idea. And yet he also accepts that locking up people for possession of cannabis is a poor idea.</p> <p>In 1990 the number of people cautioned for possession of cannabis outstripped those prosecuted for the first time, and the gap between the two groups has widened since. Any form of words that might allow the practice to continue, without using language that could make the Government look soft on drugs, would therefore be welcomed.</p> <p>The forthcoming report from the Police Foundation looks set to provide such a wording.

      "body": "<p>The point of the European Union was to prevent the rise of another Hitler. The principal goal of the postwar economic settlement was to avert a recurrence of the protectionism associated with economic depression and the rise of, well, Hitler. </p> <p>Austrians enjoy a standard of living people in prewar Germany only dreamt of. Indeed, one factor behind the rise of the Nazi apologist, J\u00f6rg Haider, is the political paralysis resulting from the Austrian economic miracle. </p> <p>So this EU member-state's economic conditions are very different from those which led Hitler, in Haider's words, to introduce 'an orderly employment policy'. It is nevertheless chilling to recall that Hitler, too, was democratically elected, and to note that many of the 'reassuring' statements about Haider are uncannily reminiscent of the reassuring statements of the early Thirties. </p> <p>Oddly, there wasn't much talk about Haider at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos. There was, however, concern about protectionism. Indeed, the theme of Davos was : How to react to Seattle? </p> <p>One union leader told me: 'I did not cause the failure of Seattle, but I contributed to it.' 'Seattle' is now the code word for protest against the seemingly inexorable march of 'globalisation' and extreme free market economics. 'What this conference is about,' said a senior participant in Davos, 'is that nobody knows how to respond to Seattle.' </p> <p>About 500 protesters knew how to respond. They arrived in the Alpine ski resort and carried on protesting. Your correspondent can report that the efficient Swiss were repairing the damage to McDonald's within hours. The protesters I bumped into described themselves as anarchists, and one gave me a leaflet repeating some of US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers's rasher statements on pollution and the Third World. It was a small demonstration but it caused a stir. </p> <p>The ill-prepared Seattle meeting would probably have failed in the absence of protesters. One reason it was not sewn up in advance is that the protesters' concerns were also bogging down negotiations between advanced and developing countries. The latter, for instance, are not too keen on advanced economies' labour standards, and regard attempts to impose them as protectionist in themselves. </p> <p>Before Davos, Pascal Lamy, the EU Trade Commissioner, had urged that another attempt should be made to launch a trade round this year. I am told he did this because he is concerned that Vice-President Al Gore is in hock to the American unions, and that under a Gore presidency traditional US tendencies towards protectionism might resurface. The American unions had certainly been active in Seattle. </p> <p>Tony Blair told the 1,000 well-heeled chief executives in Davos that Lamy was right about a new attempt at trade talks. 'I believe we can and should try to launch the new trade round this year. We cannot afford another Seattle, but nor can we afford to postpone the massive gains that a successful new round would deliver.' Blair called for 'the early establishment of an Eminent Persons Group to provide advice on how to improve the WTO's working methods'. </p> <p>Hear, hear, and eminent unionists and environmentalists, as well as eminent economists who are experts on the Third World's grievances ought to be considered for this task. </p> <p>The position of President Bill Clinton in all this is interesting. In Seattle he showed sympathy towards the protesters (including the unions) and was evidently aiming to help Gore. His speech in Davos, however, was seen by some of the businessmen as designed to redress the balance. While emphasising that the protesters must be heard, and the excluded 'included', Clinton told the Davos audience what they wanted to hear about the wonders of free trade and globalisation. </p> <p>The paradox is that we were in the 107th month of the greatest and longest economic expansion the US has ever known, yet Clinton conceded: 'Protectionist sentiment in Congress is greater now than seven years ago' (when he assumed office). In referring to the protesters' concerns about helping the victims of globalisation, or those excluded from the US boom, the President stated: 'If we can't help our people now we'll never get around to it.' </p> <p>No indeed.

      "bodyText": "The point of the European Union was to prevent the rise of another Hitler. The principal goal of the postwar economic settlement was to avert a recurrence of the protectionism associated with economic depression and the rise of, well, Hitler. Austrians enjoy a standard of living people in prewar Germany only dreamt of. Indeed, one factor behind the rise of the Nazi apologist, J\u00f6rg Haider, is the political paralysis resulting from the Austrian economic miracle. So this EU member-state's economic conditions are very different from those which led Hitler, in Haider's words, to introduce 'an orderly employment policy'. It is nevertheless chilling to recall that Hitler, too, was democratically elected, and to note that many of the 'reassuring' statements about Haider are uncannily reminiscent of the reassuring statements of the early Thirties. Oddly, there wasn't much talk about Haider at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos. There was, however, concern about protectionism. Indeed, the theme of Davos was : How to react to Seattle? One union leader told me: 'I did not cause the failure of Seattle, but I contributed to it.' 'Seattle' is now the code word for protest against the seemingly inexorable march of 'globalisation' and extreme free market economics. 'What this conference is about,' said a senior participant in Davos, 'is that nobody knows how to respond to Seattle.' About 500 protesters knew how to respond. They arrived in the Alpine ski resort and carried on protesting. Your correspondent can report that the efficient Swiss were repairing the damage to McDonald's within hours. The protesters I bumped into described themselves as anarchists, and one gave me a leaflet repeating some of US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers's rasher statements on pollution and the Third World. It was a small demonstration but it caused a stir. The ill-prepared Seattle meeting would probably have failed in the absence of protesters. One reason it was not sewn up in advance is that the protesters' concerns were also bogging down negotiations between advanced and developing countries. The latter, for instance, are not too keen on advanced economies' labour standards, and regard attempts to impose them as protectionist in themselves. Before Davos, Pascal Lamy, the EU Trade Commissioner, had urged that another attempt should be made to launch a trade round this year. I am told he did this because he is concerned that Vice-President Al Gore is in hock to the American unions, and that under a Gore presidency traditional US tendencies towards protectionism might resurface. The American unions had certainly been active in Seattle. Tony Blair told the 1,000 well-heeled chief executives in Davos that Lamy was right about a new attempt at trade talks. 'I believe we can and should try to launch the new trade round this year. We cannot afford another Seattle, but nor can we afford to postpone the massive gains that a successful new round would deliver.' Blair called for 'the early establishment of an Eminent Persons Group to provide advice on how to improve the WTO's working methods'. Hear, hear, and eminent unionists and environmentalists, as well as eminent economists who are experts on the Third World's grievances ought to be considered for this task. The position of President Bill Clinton in all this is interesting. In Seattle he showed sympathy towards the protesters (including the unions) and was evidently aiming to help Gore. His speech in Davos, however, was seen by some of the businessmen as designed to redress the balance. While emphasising that the protesters must be heard, and the excluded 'included', Clinton told the Davos audience what they wanted to hear about the wonders of free trade and globalisation. The paradox is that we were in the 107th month of the greatest and longest economic expansion the US has ever known, yet Clinton conceded: 'Protectionist sentiment in Congress is greater now than seven years ago' (when he assumed office). In referring to the protesters' concerns about helping the victims of globalisation, or those excluded from the US boom, the President stated: 'If we can't help our people now we'll never get around to it.' No indeed. And there is a terrible feeling that the bubble is going to burst. The view in Davos was that most Internet stocks were grossly overvalued; on the other hand, breakthroughs in information technology have reduced costs, and are raising productivity throughout the economy. Summers, called this 'a reverse oil shock'. Nevertheless, as the Treasury Secretary reminded his rather complacent audience: 'The laws of economics have not been repealed, much less those of human psychology.' Between the lines of recent remarks by Summers and his predecessor, Robert Rubin, one detects serious concern about the US stock market, the ballooning US trade deficit and the dependence of the US economy on 'other people's money'. Just imagine what could happen to those protectionist US tendencies if the bubble does burst, and Alan Greenspan starts regretting his decision not to get out while the going was good.",

A brave claim, particularly since more moviegoers have seen the clip than watched the entire film. During the 1905 Odessa massacre, a young woman, menaced by gunfire, stumbles and watches her pram career down the steps. Meanwhile would-be rescuers are shot at by soldiers. For modern moviegoers the symbolism may seem heavy-handed. The pram, containing an infant, represents innocence caught up in the violence of the 1905 revolution. But the skilful editing and visceral punch remain powerful. It's pure cinema. Which is just as well, since much of the acting in this silent film - performed by non-professionals - wouldn't look out of place in a Laurel and Hardy movie.<br>Nevertheless, the film has been inspirational, influencing everyone from Brian De Palma's The Untouchables to Naked Gun 331/3: The Final Insult.</p> <p><strong>View from the stalls</strong><br>\"It's hard to believe that such a momentous film could have been made when cinema was still in its youth. No money or special effects could make a film today with such power.\" Mark Mabberley, West Sussex</p> <h2>52: Bullitt - Car chase through San Francisco</h2> <p>(Peter Yates, US, 1968)</p> <p>\"The studio was dead against filming it,\" recalls Yates. \"They said we could use whatever time we had left at the end of the shoot for the car chase, which was just two weeks.\" It was a race against time to complete the intricate 10-minute sequence, using two Mustangs and two Dodge Chargers modified for high-speed chases. In some sequences the cars reached 110mph. Thankfully, McQueen and Yates were car enthusiasts. McQueen insisted on doing his own driving. \"He was adamant that the audience knew it wasn't a stunt man. Whenever he overshot a corner he would poke his head out of the window when he reversed so everyone knew it was him.\"</p> <p>Refused permission to film on the Golden Gate Bridge, Yates was able to make use of the city's famous hilly streets. \"No one wanted to shoot on the hills, the stunt guys were used to driving through barrels and jumping off runways, but the idea of jumping the cars up and down drew a lot of criticism.\" Even while editing the film, Yates remained unconvinced about the chase, until the sequence received a rapturous reception at a New York test screening. McQueen was so impressed he asked the director to helm Le Mans, his epic about the 24-hour race. \"I felt one film was enough. Le Mans was not a happy time for him. His wife left him and he sacked the director. I'm glad I sidestepped that one.\" </p> <h2>53: Carrie - The horror ending</h2> <p>(Brian DePalma, US, 1976)</p> <p>Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is an odd duck, bullied at school and again at home by her domineering evangelist mother. But things seem to be going right when she's invited to the prom by one of the school's most eligible bachelors. In fact, this is just a ruse to humiliate her. Crowned prom queen, Carrie is doused in pig's blood, causing her repressed emotions to spill out in a violent, telekinetic rage that claims the lives of all her tormentors. When her home burns down in the ensuing chaos, Carrie is believed to have died, too, and a classmate (Amy Irving) feels guilty for standing idly by. At the film's close, she goes to make peace with Carrie. As she lays flowers on the grave, the dead girl's bloody arm shoots up through the earth and grabs her.<br>A landmark in shock cinema, this scene was actually shot in reverse, with the barefoot Irving walking backwards over the rubble of Carrie's house. More surprisingly, the hand actually belongs to Sissy Spacek, who was hidden from view in a specially constructed box. \"Those rocks were pumice and they were heavy,\" she explained. \"It was the last day of shooting and I was all dolled-up and they wanted my stand-in to do it. But my hand is my hand! It was claustrophobic, but very exciting. I couldn't see, and what with the blood being slippery, I almost broke Amy's arm! The rocks scratched my arm to bits all the way down, but I wouldn't have missed that for the world!\"</p> <h2>54: It's A Wonderful Life - George discovers he's still alive</h2> <p>(Frank Capra, US, 1946)</p> <p>Strange as it now seems, It's A Wonderful Life was a flop that Capra never quite recovered from, sending him into a depression only made worse by his disastrous attempt to sit on the fence during the Hollywood witchhunt. But because the film was incorrectly copyrighted, it played and played on US TV until everyone just assumed it had always been a classic. And it is a great film, one now in danger of being underestimated because people forget just how dark much of it is.</p> <p>The uplifting ending only works because of George's suicidal crisis. After George (James Stewart) has stumbled through the nightmare alternative universe of Pottersville (actually far closer to modern America than the town he returns to), comes an outburst of joy. George is begging for another chance at life. A police car pulls up, and Bert (Ward Bond) gets out.</p> <p>Bert: George!<br>George: George? Bert, do you know me?<br>Bert: Know you? I've been looking all over town for you. I saw your car crashed into that tree and - say, your mouth's bleeding, you sure you're all right?<br>George: (Licking his mouth tentatively, then ecstatically) My mouth's bleeding, Bert! My mouth's bleed? (He reaches in his pocket) Zuzu's petals! Zuzu's? There they are! <br>Bert! What do you know about that! Merry Christmas! (He hugs Bert, and then runs through the snow back into town, shouting for joy.) Hello Bedford Falls! Merry Christmas movie house! Merry Christmas emporium! Merry Christmas you wonderful old Building commit;! Merry Christmas Mr Potter!</p> <h2>55: LA Confidential - Dudley Smith shoots Jack Vincennes</h2> <p>(Curtis Hanson, US, 1997)</p> <p>Despite being one of America's top crime writers, James Ellroy and his hard-bitten novels had found little demand in Hollywood. The problem lay in Ellroy's dense, sprawling books, charting the grim world inhabited by post-war Los Angeles detectives. LA Confidential was the third in a loosely linked quartet about the city's cops, and by popular consent deemed unfilmable. Journeyman director Curtis Hanson thought different. He cut out numerous characters and slimmed down the labyrinthine plots, although the same principal characters, three deeply flawed cops, propel the action in both film and novel.</p> <p>Starting out with a mysterious killing at a late bar, the three detectives, initially hostile to each other, combine, uncovering sleaze and corruption. Dandy cop 'Hollywood' Jack Vincennes inadvertently solves the riddle, two-thirds into the film, when he informs his superior Dudley Smith of his private investigations. Smith responds by shooting him. The look on Vincennes' face at the moment of death is unforgettable. His premature death shocked audiences, not least because Spacey was meant to be the star of the film. His death also ended Vincennes' putative redemption. \"In a way he is a tragic figure,\" says Spacey. \"At the point of his death he has reached a level of self-awareness, and is on the verge of becoming a different sort of person, so his death is very poignant.\" </p> <h2>56: Reservoir Dogs - Ear amputation</h2> <p>(Quentin Tarantino, US, 1991)</p> <p>In a disused LA warehouse, a cop is at the mercy of a deranged criminal, part of a colour-coded gang whose raid on a jewellery store has just gone disastrously wrong. 'Now where were we?' says the psychotic Mr Blonde (Michael Madsen). 'I told you,' says the cop, 'I don't know anything about any fucking set-up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want.' 'Thanks,' says Mr Blonde, 'don't mind if I do.' The cop squirms as his mouth is covered with industrial tape. 'Now,' says Mr Blonde, 'I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, there's nothing you can do. Except pray for death.'<br>The radio catches the start of the Stealer's Wheel hit 'Stuck In The Middle With You'.</p> <p>Mr Blonde taps his foot, starts a lumbering dance and pulls a cut-throat razor from his boot. Seconds later, cop and ear have parted company in a slick, offscreen moment of suggested violence. Tarantino has arrived.</p> <h2>57: Shane - 'Shane! Come back!'</h2> <p>(George Stevens, US, 1953)</p> <p>Of course Alan Ladd didn't return. To do so would have gone against the western genre rulebook?Blatantly symbolic, Shane has emerged as the classic evocation of the western myth, charting the battle between good and evil. Blond-haired, buckskin-clad Ladd is pitted against the evil (black-outfitted) Jack Palance. As the wandering gunfighter, Ladd finds temporary peace at the homestead run by Joey Starrett's (Brandon de Wilde) family. But after ridding the valley of evil, he is destined to continue his restless journey.<br>At the time, Shane's mythic importance was ignored by many critics who lavished praise on de Wilde's performance. According to The New York Times, 'It is Master de Wilde with his bright face and his resolute boyish ways who clinches Shane as a most unusual film.'</p> <h2>58: The Empire Strikes Back - 'I am your father'</h2> <p>(Irvin Kershner, US, 1980)</p> <p>We're all experts now, but when Star Wars came out in 1977, none of us knew that the sequel was already storyboarded in George Lucas's mind - or indeed that we'd just been watching Part IV - so the idea of Darth Vader turning out to be Luke's dad was a real ace up the saga's sleeve. And the moment of revelation couldn't have been better. Our heroes (Han, Leia, the droids, Chewbacca) have been intercepted by Vader's Imperial troops at the man-made metropolis Cloud City, high above the gas planet of Bespin. (Don't you just love this stuff?) Luke, after rescuing them, faces up to Vader, and a thrilling light-saber battle ensues in the carbon-freezing chamber.</p> <p>'Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker,' intones Vader, trying to convince Luke to rule the galaxy with him.</p> <p>Their duel winds up on a gantry in the reactor control room. There is a lot of acrobatic jumping and swordsmanship. Vader cuts off Luke's right hand and he is trapped. Vader taunts him: 'Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.'</p> <p>'He told me enough!' squeals Luke. 'It was you who killed him'.</p> <p>'No.' says Vader, his face quite literally an emotionless mask. 'I am your father.'</p> <h2>59: The Godfather - The horse's head</h2> <p>(Francis Ford Coppola, US, 1971)</p> <p>Years after the movie was made, a somewhat bewildered Francis Coppola said, \"The horse's head sequence was very controversial. People were more outraged by the horse's head than the three dozen people that get killed in The Godfather.\" It's Hollywood convention that you can wipe out cities of humans, but showing a single dog dying is beyond the pale. But the power of the horse's head scene comes not just from what happens, but how it's done. Hagen (Robert Duvall) has gone to Hollywood to get Sinatra-esque crooner Johnny Fontaine into a movie. The producer, Mr Woltz (John Marley), entertains Hagen in style, and shows off his $600,000 stud horse, but won't budge. Hagen informs him that Don Vito 'never asks for a second favour'. In early morning light, we drift very slowly towards Woltz's colonial mansion. In his bedroom, Woltz stirs gradually and then, writhing awake, Woltz begins to look confused. He looks at his sheets and sees blood. Sitting up, he pulls them back, and there is the severed head of the $600,000 horse.</p> <h2>60: The Railway Children - Bobbie's father walks through the steam</h2> <p>(Lionel Jeffries, UK, 1970)</p> <p>'Oh my daddy, my daddy!' cries Jenny Agutter as she races towards her long-lost father at the end of The Railway Children. Based on Edith Nesbit's Victorian classic, the story concerns a middle-class family forced to move to the country and endure relative penury after the mysterious disappearance, due to false imprisonment, of their beloved dad.</p> <p>Filmed during the summer of 1969, the feature-length adaptation marked the second time Agutter had played the same role. In 1968 she starred in the BBC's television series. At 17 she was only a few years older than her character, but Sally Thomsett, then 21, played Phyllis who was only eight years old (at least in the book). Many scenes were filmed on the Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway, which had been reopened by volunteers the previous year. The railway is still working, partly thanks to the continued interest generated by the film.</p> <p><strong>Jenny Agutter, actress (Bobbie)</strong><br>\"Each time one of the children got their lines right on the first take and he had a usable scene [director] Lionel Jeffries would give us half a crown. He created a family atmosphere on the set. He was like a grand Edwardian gentleman. The only time he got angry was when we sneaked off to Leeds one evening to go to a nightclub. I remember the scene took quite a lot of time to set up even though it looks very simple. Lionel had the scene conceived in his mind and it really came together in the editing room. There were so many background noises in that scene, with the locomotives and everything; Lionel thought they would obscure my dialogue, so he asked me back into the studio to over-dub it weeks later. As an actor, he knew how he wanted the line to sound, but I couldn't get it the way he wanted. I think I got quite close, but he wasn't happy. In the end he decided to use the original soundtrack. I think the moment has been so successful because it tells a story about innocence very, very clearly. I don't think it's too sentimental but it captures Bobbie's absolute longing.\"</p> <p>Jenny Agutter left England for Hollywood during the Seventies, and appeared in An American Werewolf In London and Logan's Run. Now back in England, she has just finished filming a feature-length TV version of \"The Railway Children\" in which she plays the mother.</p> <p><strong>Lionel Jeffries, director</strong><br>\"The scene came straight out of the novel. I just put the words into pictures. I can't remember what I said to Jenny to prepare her for the scene. I've never had any trouble working with children. They may not have as much knowledge, but I've met more wise children than wise adults. My eight-year-old daughter Martha first gave me the idea for the film. She had just read the book and told me, \"That would make a fine film, Dad.\" I bought the rights for \u00a32,000 and wrote the script but everyone I approached for money said, 'This isn't the time to make that kind of film.' The director Bryan Forbes eventually backed me. I think the film and that moment were successful because the public was bored with just sex and violence on the screen. There was an enormous market for true entertainment.\"</p> <p>Lionel Jeffries went on to direct four more family-orientated films including 'Wombling Free'. As a character actor, he has appeared in numerous films and television dramas.</p> <p><strong>Graham Mitchell, Vice-President of the Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway, who appeared in the film as the train guard</strong><br>\"You cannot allow actors to operate locomotives or level crossings so I was employed to operate the locomotive. The Railway Preservation Society appointed the late Labour MP Bob Cryer as the film liasion officer. It was an important summer for the district. There were two very low budget films being made and both of them have become classics. Kes [filmed in Barnsley, and featuring at 33 in our list] was the other one. Oakworth station [the scene of the father-daughter reunion] has remained the same as the day the film crews left. There is no electricity, just gaslight; no posters, just tin signs on the fences. The film is set in 1905 and there was no real need to change the railway to suit the period. It's like a timewarp here. Bob Cryer appeared in the final scene. You can hear Perks (Bernard Cribbins) in the background further down the platform saying, 'Right away, Mr Cryer.' The railway has featured in lots of period TV dramas and two other feature-length films - Yanks, the Richard Gere film, and Fairytale: A True Story.\"</p>",

Starting out with a mysterious killing at a late bar, the three detectives, initially hostile to each other, combine, uncovering sleaze and corruption. Dandy cop 'Hollywood' Jack Vincennes inadvertently solves the riddle, two-thirds into the film, when he informs his superior Dudley Smith of his private investigations. Smith responds by shooting him. The look on Vincennes' face at the moment of death is unforgettable. His premature death shocked audiences, not least because Spacey was meant to be the star of the film. His death also ended Vincennes' putative redemption. \"In a way he is a tragic figure,\" says Spacey. \"At the point of his death he has reached a level of self-awareness, and is on the verge of becoming a different sort of person, so his death is very poignant.\" 56: Reservoir Dogs - Ear amputation (Quentin Tarantino, US, 1991) In a disused LA warehouse, a cop is at the mercy of a deranged criminal, part of a colour-coded gang whose raid on a jewellery store has just gone disastrously wrong. 'Now where were we?' says the psychotic Mr Blonde (Michael Madsen). 'I told you,' says the cop, 'I don't know anything about any fucking set-up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want.' 'Thanks,' says Mr Blonde, 'don't mind if I do.' The cop squirms as his mouth is covered with industrial tape. 'Now,' says Mr Blonde, 'I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, there's nothing you can do. Except pray for death.' The radio catches the start of the Stealer's Wheel hit 'Stuck In The Middle With You'. Mr Blonde taps his foot, starts a lumbering dance and pulls a cut-throat razor from his boot. Seconds later, cop and ear have parted company in a slick, offscreen moment of suggested violence. Tarantino has arrived. 57: Shane - 'Shane! Come back!' (George Stevens, US, 1953) Of course Alan Ladd didn't return. To do so would have gone against the western genre rulebook?Blatantly symbolic, Shane has emerged as the classic evocation of the western myth, charting the battle between good and evil. Blond-haired, buckskin-clad Ladd is pitted against the evil (black-outfitted) Jack Palance. As the wandering gunfighter, Ladd finds temporary peace at the homestead run by Joey Starrett's (Brandon de Wilde) family. But after ridding the valley of evil, he is destined to continue his restless journey. At the time, Shane's mythic importance was ignored by many critics who lavished praise on de Wilde's performance. According to The New York Times, 'It is Master de Wilde with his bright face and his resolute boyish ways who clinches Shane as a most unusual film.' 58: The Empire Strikes Back - 'I am your father' (Irvin Kershner, US, 1980) We're all experts now, but when Star Wars came out in 1977, none of us knew that the sequel was already storyboarded in George Lucas's mind - or indeed that we'd just been watching Part IV - so the idea of Darth Vader turning out to be Luke's dad was a real ace up the saga's sleeve. And the moment of revelation couldn't have been better. Our heroes (Han, Leia, the droids, Chewbacca) have been intercepted by Vader's Imperial troops at the man-made metropolis Cloud City, high above the gas planet of Bespin. (Don't you just love this stuff?) Luke, after rescuing them, faces up to Vader, and a thrilling light-saber battle ensues in the carbon-freezing chamber. 'Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker,' intones Vader, trying to convince Luke to rule the galaxy with him. Their duel winds up on a gantry in the reactor control room. There is a lot of acrobatic jumping and swordsmanship. Vader cuts off Luke's right hand and he is trapped. Vader taunts him: 'Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.' 'He told me enough!' squeals Luke. 'It was you who killed him'. 'No.' says Vader, his face quite literally an emotionless mask. 'I am your father.' 59: The Godfather - The horse's head (Francis Ford Coppola, US, 1971) Years after the movie was made, a somewhat bewildered Francis Coppola said, \"The horse's head sequence was very controversial. People were more outraged by the horse's head than the three dozen people that get killed in The Godfather.\" It's Hollywood convention that you can wipe out cities of humans, but showing a single dog dying is beyond the pale. But the power of the horse's head scene comes not just from what happens, but how it's done. Hagen (Robert Duvall) has gone to Hollywood to get Sinatra-esque crooner Johnny Fontaine into a movie. The producer, Mr Woltz (John Marley), entertains Hagen in style, and shows off his $600,000 stud horse, but won't budge. Hagen informs him that Don Vito 'never asks for a second favour'. In early morning light, we drift very slowly towards Woltz's colonial mansion. In his bedroom, Woltz stirs gradually and then, writhing awake, Woltz begins to look confused. He looks at his sheets and sees blood. Sitting up, he pulls them back, and there is the severed head of the $600,000 horse. 60: The Railway Children - Bobbie's father walks through the steam (Lionel Jeffries, UK, 1970) 'Oh my daddy, my daddy!' cries Jenny Agutter as she races towards her long-lost father at the end of The Railway Children. Based on Edith Nesbit's Victorian classic, the story concerns a middle-class family forced to move to the country and endure relative penury after the mysterious disappearance, due to false imprisonment, of their beloved dad. Filmed during the summer of 1969, the feature-length adaptation marked the second time Agutter had played the same role. In 1968 she starred in the BBC's television series. At 17 she was only a few years older than her character, but Sally Thomsett, then 21, played Phyllis who was only eight years old (at least in the book). Many scenes were filmed on the Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway, which had been reopened by volunteers the previous year. The railway is still working, partly thanks to the continued interest generated by the film. Jenny Agutter, actress (Bobbie) \"Each time one of the children got their lines right on the first take and he had a usable scene [director] Lionel Jeffries would give us half a crown. He created a family atmosphere on the set. He was like a grand Edwardian gentleman. The only time he got angry was when we sneaked off to Leeds one evening to go to a nightclub. I remember the scene took quite a lot of time to set up even though it looks very simple. Lionel had the scene conceived in his mind and it really came together in the editing room. There were so many background noises in that scene, with the locomotives and everything; Lionel thought they would obscure my dialogue, so he asked me back into the studio to over-dub it weeks later. As an actor, he knew how he wanted the line to sound, but I couldn't get it the way he wanted. I think I got quite close, but he wasn't happy. In the end he decided to use the original soundtrack. I think the moment has been so successful because it tells a story about innocence very, very clearly. I don't think it's too sentimental but it captures Bobbie's absolute longing.\" Jenny Agutter left England for Hollywood during the Seventies, and appeared in An American Werewolf In London and Logan's Run. Now back in England, she has just finished filming a feature-length TV version of \"The Railway Children\" in which she plays the mother. Lionel Jeffries, director \"The scene came straight out of the novel. I just put the words into pictures. I can't remember what I said to Jenny to prepare her for the scene. I've never had any trouble working with children. They may not have as much knowledge, but I've met more wise children than wise adults. My eight-year-old daughter Martha first gave me the idea for the film. She had just read the book and told me, \"That would make a fine film, Dad.\" I bought the rights for \u00a32,000 and wrote the script but everyone I approached for money said, 'This isn't the time to make that kind of film.' The director Bryan Forbes eventually backed me. I think the film and that moment were successful because the public was bored with just sex and violence on the screen. There was an enormous market for true entertainment.\" Lionel Jeffries went on to direct four more family-orientated films including 'Wombling Free'. As a character actor, he has appeared in numerous films and television dramas. Graham Mitchell, Vice-President of the Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway, who appeared in the film as the train guard \"You cannot allow actors to operate locomotives or level crossings so I was employed to operate the locomotive. The Railway Preservation Society appointed the late Labour MP Bob Cryer as the film liasion officer. It was an important summer for the district. There were two very low budget films being made and both of them have become classics. Kes [filmed in Barnsley, and featuring at 33 in our list] was the other one. Oakworth station [the scene of the father-daughter reunion] has remained the same as the day the film crews left. There is no electricity, just gaslight; no posters, just tin signs on the fences. The film is set in 1905 and there was no real need to change the railway to suit the period. It's like a timewarp here. Bob Cryer appeared in the final scene. You can hear Perks (Bernard Cribbins) in the background further down the platform saying, 'Right away, Mr Cryer.' The railway has featured in lots of period TV dramas and two other feature-length films - Yanks, the Richard Gere film, and Fairytale: A True Story.\"",

Let's.<br>And they went, holding hands in a final act of defiance. For their troubles they made the cover of Time magazine, were spoofed on The Simpsons and paid homage to in a series of car adverts. Described by critics at the time as a feminist manifesto for the Nineties, Ridley Scott's film was an outlaws-on-the-run movie which carried extra resonance. The gun-toting fugitives, played by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, broke the rules for Hollywood screen heroines. Of course, this was a serious movie so they couldn't escape their fate. Instead of prison, the gal pals chose freedom. They drove off the cliff, the image froze, the screen turning white. Recalls Davis: \"It was the last day of shooting, and the sun was going down. We looked at each other, and it was just so weighted for so many reasons. I mean, we were getting ready to kill ourselves as our characters, and we've had this incredible, fun relationship as humans, and this was us saying goodbye to this experience and stuff.\"</p> <h2>62: Trainspotting - Renton goes cold turkey</h2> <p>(Danny Boyle, UK, 1996)</p> <p>In preparation for his career-defining role as funky junkie Renton, Ewan McGregor hung out with heroin addicts in Luxembourg (where he was shooting The Pillow Book).<br>\"I got some of my look from them,\" he says. \"And some physical ideas.\"</p> <p>He opted against trying heroin - so, method acting it may not technically be, but McGregor's performance during his pivotal cold turkey scene is a tour de force of the most uncomfortable kind. To a pounding techno beat ('Dark And Long' by Underworld) and in a caricature of his bedroom with teenage boy's steam-engine wallpaper and Hibernian paraphernalia on the walls, Renton suffers the sweats, hallucinations and terror that go hand in hand with coming off heroin. Director Boyle pulls out all the visual stops, shooting from under the sheets, intercutting with an imagined game show in which Dale Winton asks Aids-related questions to Mr and Mrs Renton, and theatrically introducing other characters as ghosts in Renton's nightmare, including Diane (Kelly McDonald) singing New Order's 'Temptation'.</p> <p>The climax to the ordeal is a hallucinated baby crawling along the ceiling - a rather obvious mechanical model, but no less unnerving - whose swollen, lifeless face turns around, Exorcist-style, before dropping on to a screaming Renton. Phew. No wonder National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley declared that Trainspotting \"leaves you in no doubt about the ravages of drug addiction\". </p> <h2>63: Witness - Dance in the farm barn</h2> <p>(Peter Weir, US, 1985)</p> <p>Astaire and Rogers didn't make the list but Ford and McGillis did. The awkward shuffle they do to Greg Chapman's version of 'What A Wonderful World' hardly merits a mention for its choreography. The setting is everything. The illicit attraction between the big city cop and rural Amish widow forms the emotional heart of the romantic thriller. In fact, the scene nearly didn't make it. A late addition to the project, Weir rewrote the script, stripping out much of its melodrama in his draft, including this particular scene. Instead, the noted Australian art-house director (Picnic At Hanging Rock) wanted to concentrate on the culture clash between Ford and the Amish. \"Obviously the Amish element and the contrast between the two worlds was what interested me in the script,\" says Weir. It took his veteran producer Edward S. Feldman to convince him otherwise. \"He kept saying 'remember the audience' and 'remember it's a thriller'.\" So, the Ford-McGillis relationship once again formed the crux of the film, andWeir reinstated the barn scene, though removing much of the original dialogue in favour of nuances and glances.</p> <h2>64: Manhattan - The opening sequence</h2> <p>(Woody Allen, US, 1979)</p> <p>To the sound of George Gershwin and a montage of New York scenes, aspiring novelist Woody Allen narrates the beginning of his great novel about the city:<br>'Chapter One. He adored New York City. He idolised it all out of proportion - er, no, make that: he - he romanticised it all out of proportion. Yes. To him, no matter what the season was, this was still a town that existed in black and white and pulsated to the great tunes of George Gershwin. - Er, tsch, no.<br>Chapter One. He was too romantic about Manhattan, as he was about everything else. He thrived on the hustle bustle of the crowds and the traffic. To him, New York meant beautiful women and street-smart guys who seemed to know all the angles. - No, no, corny, too corny for a man of my taste. Can we?can we try and make it more profound?</p> <p>Chapter One. He adored New York City. To him, it was a metaphor for the decay of contemporary culture. The same lack of individual integrity that caused so many people to take the easy way out...No, that's a little bit too preachy. I mean, you know, let's face it, I want to sell some books here.<br>Chapter One. He adored New York City, although to him it was a metaphor for the decay of contemporary culture. How hard it was to exist in a society desensitized by drugs, loud music?Too angry. I don't want to be angry.<br>Chapter One. He was as tough and romantic as the city he loved. Behind his black-rimmed glasses was the coiled sexual power of a jungle cat. - I love this. - New York was his town, and it always would be.'</p> <h2>65: Manon Des Sources - C\u00e9sar discovers he has a child</h2> <p>(Claude Berri, France, 1986)</p> <p>The second half of the adaptation of Marcel Pagnol's L'Eau des Collines, Manon des Sources was filmed back to back with Jean de Florette. The two were unlikely international hits. Florette had greater critical acclaim, providing an eager audience for the sequel. Manon, which took up the action 10 years later, can lay claim to the most emotional scene. In the first film, two farmers, C\u00e9sar (Yves Montand) and Ugolin (Daniel Autueil), conspire to drive a hunchbacked newcomer (G\u00e9rard D\u00e9pardieu) from his land, and he kills himself in a freak accident. In Manon, his daughter (Emmanuelle B\u00e9art) emerges to wreak revenge. The second tragedy is a result of the novel's fatalism. After many years, bachelor C\u00e9sar's lost love visits him, telling him for the first time about the child he fathered. Most moviegoers had probably guessed the awful twist during her monologue. Their son had a hunchback. C\u00e9sar had effectively killed his own offspring. His comeuppance is a literary conceit and lacks a measure of conviction on screen, but C\u00e9sar's anguish is still terrible to behold. </p> <h2>66: Once Upon A Time In The West - The mystery man's flashback</h2> <p>(Sergio Leone, Italy, 1968)</p> <p>Leone was already successful through the Man With No Name trilogy of Italian horse operas, A Fistful Of Dollars (1964), For A Few Dollars More (1965). Here, Leone wanted to work with legendary western good guy Henry Fonda, take his snow-white screen image and turn it right round, casting him as a sadistic, immoral killer. Fonda's piercing blue eyes add a chilling edge to his character as a hired heavy, known as 'The Man', who is trying to force a widow off her land so it can be handed over to unscrupulous railroad developers.<br>A mysterious drifter (Charles Bronson) is going all out to stop him, which puzzles The Man, and at their final showdown he asks him bluntly, 'Who are you?' Bronson throws him a harmonica, a cue for a gruelling flashback in which The Man recalls the stranger as a young boy holding his older brother on his shoulders. The older boy has a noose round his neck, and if the younger boy slips, he will hang. The Man pushes a harmonica into the boy's mouth. 'Keep your lovin' brother happy,' he sneers, as Ennio Morricone's haunting score warns of the inevitable outcome.</p> <h2>67: Paris, Texas - The peepshow booth encounter</h2> <p>(Wim Wenders, WGer/Fr/UK, 1984)</p> <p>The film that launched German Wim Wenders as a major English-language director was a cinephile's delight. In part it is a beautifully observed road movie, charting the emotional journey of an estranged father (Harry Dean Stanton) and son (Hunter Carson), stark landscape echoing state of mind. It is also a meditation on the absence of communication. Fittingly, the ironic location for climactic meeting between former lovers Stanton and Nastassja Kinski takes place at her workplace, a peepshow booth, which, it soon transpires, also acts as a confessional booth. They talk over the phone, separated by a window, unable to see or touch each other. The glass separating them is symbolic, but on its surface their superimposed faces connect. One of the longest 'moments' on the list, the growing recognition on Kinski's face as she hears her husband's voice, stands out. The film's central mystery, the history of their relationship, is revealed. So compelling is the dialogue, scenes run for minutes without a cut.</p> <h2>68: Play It Again Sam - Woody and the Oscar Peterson album</h2> <p>(Herbert Ross, US, 1972)</p> <p>When Play It Again Sam, the original stage play, opened on Broadway in 1969, someone calculated that its three acts contained an amazing 155 laughs. Much of the play transferred straight to the screen, and many of its laughs still came from an early scene in which nerdy film journalist Allan Felix (Allen) attempts to impress a date, Sharon (Jennifer Salt), in his untidy Bogart-shrine apartment.</p> <p>Having draped impressive artefacts around the place in preparation (opened books, a Bartok album sleeve, his 100-yard dash medal) and convinced himself of his 'tremendous poise', he falls to pieces on Sharon's arrival, entangling himself in his jacket and being unable to form words.</p> <p>The killer pratfall comes when he removes an Oscar Peterson record from the turntable and puts it back in its sleeve. While talking, he gesticulates and the disc comes flying out of the sleeve, crashing off-camera. Attempting a recovery, Allen casts the sleeve in the other direction, causing further damage, and leans stylishly on the back of an armchair - which tips up, sending a coffee table's contents flying. He ends up in a heap on the floor.</p> <p>Allen transferred his stand-up persona to the big screen in the Buster Keaton-influenced Take The Money And Run. And Sam helped to patent the clumsy, nebbish persona that became Allen's hallmark. The Oscar Peterson sleeve sight-gag may have been the turning point.</p> <h2>69: The Graduate - Sitting at the back of the bus</h2> <p>(Mike Nichols, US, 1967)</p> <p>'This is Benjamin. He is a little worried about his future'.</p> <p>That's the tagline which introduced the world to The Graduate, the iconoclastic Hollywood movie of the Sixties. Mike Nichols' film exposed a generation apparently uneasy with their parent's attitudes and lifestyle. The plot - a feted recent graduate embarks on a passionate affair with an older woman - was only half the story. To the melodies of Simon and Garfunkel's wistful soundtrack, Nichols showed there was something wrong in affluent southern California. The Graduate was also an example of more relaxed attitudes towards sex on screen. 'Mrs Robinson, you're trying to seduce me!' Hoffman spluttered. Elsewhere, he was depicted framed inside middle-aged seductress Anne Bancroft's stockinged leg. Nichols agonised about how to end the film after Hoffman has disrupted Ross's wedding shortly after she said 'I do'. As they escape angry guests on the back of a bus, the camera lingers on Hoffman's face for an unnaturally long time, signifying relief then apprehension about his uncertain future.</p> <h2>70: The Princess Bride - The clifftop duel</h2> <p>(Rob Reiner, US, 1987)</p> <p>This novel and screenplay by veteran Hollywood hack William Goldman, is a loving spoof of the chivalrous adventure. Its most appealing character is Spanish adventurer Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), who has joined up with Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) to kidnap reluctant royal bride Buttercup (Robin Wright). They are being chased by the mysterious Man In Black (Cary Elwes). Montoya confronts him, sportingly using his weaker left hand. They start a duel, chatting as they go.<br>Montoya: You are wonderful! <br>Man In Black: Thank you. I've worked hard to become so. <br>Montoya: I admit it, you are better than I am. <br>Man In Black: Then why are you smiling? <br>Montoya: Because I know something you don't know. <br>Man In Black: And what is that? <br>Montoya: I? am not left-handed! <br>He flips his sword to his right hand and drives the Man In Black back. <br>Man In Black: You are amazing! <br>Montoya: I ought to be, after 20 years. <br>(His opponent leans on a wall for support.) <br>Man In Black: Oh, there's something I ought to tell you. <br>Montoya: Tell me. <br>Man In Black: I'm not left-handed either.</p>",

In the first film, two farmers, C\u00e9sar (Yves Montand) and Ugolin (Daniel Autueil), conspire to drive a hunchbacked newcomer (G\u00e9rard D\u00e9pardieu) from his land, and he kills himself in a freak accident. In Manon, his daughter (Emmanuelle B\u00e9art) emerges to wreak revenge. The second tragedy is a result of the novel's fatalism. After many years, bachelor C\u00e9sar's lost love visits him, telling him for the first time about the child he fathered. Most moviegoers had probably guessed the awful twist during her monologue. Their son had a hunchback. C\u00e9sar had effectively killed his own offspring. His comeuppance is a literary conceit and lacks a measure of conviction on screen, but C\u00e9sar's anguish is still terrible to behold. 66: Once Upon A Time In The West - The mystery man's flashback (Sergio Leone, Italy, 1968) Leone was already successful through the Man With No Name trilogy of Italian horse operas, A Fistful Of Dollars (1964), For A Few Dollars More (1965). Here, Leone wanted to work with legendary western good guy Henry Fonda, take his snow-white screen image and turn it right round, casting him as a sadistic, immoral killer. Fonda's piercing blue eyes add a chilling edge to his character as a hired heavy, known as 'The Man', who is trying to force a widow off her land so it can be handed over to unscrupulous railroad developers. A mysterious drifter (Charles Bronson) is going all out to stop him, which puzzles The Man, and at their final showdown he asks him bluntly, 'Who are you?' Bronson throws him a harmonica, a cue for a gruelling flashback in which The Man recalls the stranger as a young boy holding his older brother on his shoulders. The older boy has a noose round his neck, and if the younger boy slips, he will hang. The Man pushes a harmonica into the boy's mouth. 'Keep your lovin' brother happy,' he sneers, as Ennio Morricone's haunting score warns of the inevitable outcome. 67: Paris, Texas - The peepshow booth encounter (Wim Wenders, WGer/Fr/UK, 1984) The film that launched German Wim Wenders as a major English-language director was a cinephile's delight. In part it is a beautifully observed road movie, charting the emotional journey of an estranged father (Harry Dean Stanton) and son (Hunter Carson), stark landscape echoing state of mind. It is also a meditation on the absence of communication. Fittingly, the ironic location for climactic meeting between former lovers Stanton and Nastassja Kinski takes place at her workplace, a peepshow booth, which, it soon transpires, also acts as a confessional booth. They talk over the phone, separated by a window, unable to see or touch each other. The glass separating them is symbolic, but on its surface their superimposed faces connect. One of the longest 'moments' on the list, the growing recognition on Kinski's face as she hears her husband's voice, stands out. The film's central mystery, the history of their relationship, is revealed. So compelling is the dialogue, scenes run for minutes without a cut. 68: Play It Again Sam - Woody and the Oscar Peterson album (Herbert Ross, US, 1972) When Play It Again Sam, the original stage play, opened on Broadway in 1969, someone calculated that its three acts contained an amazing 155 laughs. Much of the play transferred straight to the screen, and many of its laughs still came from an early scene in which nerdy film journalist Allan Felix (Allen) attempts to impress a date, Sharon (Jennifer Salt), in his untidy Bogart-shrine apartment. Having draped impressive artefacts around the place in preparation (opened books, a Bartok album sleeve, his 100-yard dash medal) and convinced himself of his 'tremendous poise', he falls to pieces on Sharon's arrival, entangling himself in his jacket and being unable to form words. The killer pratfall comes when he removes an Oscar Peterson record from the turntable and puts it back in its sleeve. While talking, he gesticulates and the disc comes flying out of the sleeve, crashing off-camera. Attempting a recovery, Allen casts the sleeve in the other direction, causing further damage, and leans stylishly on the back of an armchair - which tips up, sending a coffee table's contents flying. He ends up in a heap on the floor. Allen transferred his stand-up persona to the big screen in the Buster Keaton-influenced Take The Money And Run. And Sam helped to patent the clumsy, nebbish persona that became Allen's hallmark. The Oscar Peterson sleeve sight-gag may have been the turning point. 69: The Graduate - Sitting at the back of the bus (Mike Nichols, US, 1967) 'This is Benjamin. He is a little worried about his future'. That's the tagline which introduced the world to The Graduate, the iconoclastic Hollywood movie of the Sixties. Mike Nichols' film exposed a generation apparently uneasy with their parent's attitudes and lifestyle. The plot - a feted recent graduate embarks on a passionate affair with an older woman - was only half the story. To the melodies of Simon and Garfunkel's wistful soundtrack, Nichols showed there was something wrong in affluent southern California. The Graduate was also an example of more relaxed attitudes towards sex on screen. 'Mrs Robinson, you're trying to seduce me!' Hoffman spluttered. Elsewhere, he was depicted framed inside middle-aged seductress Anne Bancroft's stockinged leg. Nichols agonised about how to end the film after Hoffman has disrupted Ross's wedding shortly after she said 'I do'. As they escape angry guests on the back of a bus, the camera lingers on Hoffman's face for an unnaturally long time, signifying relief then apprehension about his uncertain future. 70: The Princess Bride - The clifftop duel (Rob Reiner, US, 1987) This novel and screenplay by veteran Hollywood hack William Goldman, is a loving spoof of the chivalrous adventure. Its most appealing character is Spanish adventurer Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), who has joined up with Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) to kidnap reluctant royal bride Buttercup (Robin Wright). They are being chased by the mysterious Man In Black (Cary Elwes). Montoya confronts him, sportingly using his weaker left hand. They start a duel, chatting as they go. Montoya: You are wonderful! Man In Black: Thank you. I've worked hard to become so. Montoya: I admit it, you are better than I am. Man In Black: Then why are you smiling? Montoya: Because I know something you don't know. Man In Black: And what is that? Montoya: I? am not left-handed! He flips his sword to his right hand and drives the Man In Black back. Man In Black: You are amazing! Montoya: I ought to be, after 20 years. (His opponent leans on a wall for support.) Man In Black: Oh, there's something I ought to tell you. Montoya: Tell me. Man In Black: I'm not left-handed either.",

      "body": "<h2>71: The Searchers - Ethan Edwards' final cut</h2> <p>(John Ford, US 1956)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GXUz-Nntyks?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-GXUz-Nntyks\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GXUz-Nntyks?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"276\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p>All but ignored by the Academy Awards on its release, The Searchers is perhaps the very epitome of the American western - certainly the perfect crystallisation of all John Ford's favoured themes and the best, most complex performance given by its star, John Wayne.</p> <p>Fittingly for a film about a brutal outsider, The Searchers begins and ends with a shot of an open door filmed from inside a ranch house, looking out - and both the first and last time we see Wayne's character, Ethan Edwards, he is framed by darkness.</p> <p>A mysterious figure whose personal background is shady and possibly criminal, Ethan vows revenge when his brother and sister-in-law are butchered by Indians and their youngest daughter, Debbie, is kidnapped. Ethan begins a five-year quest to find her, but when he does, he finds to his disgust that the child is now a young woman and acclimatised to 'her' people. Ethan is forced to confront his racism through Debbie's part-Cherokee brother Marty, who persuades her to return, and after a tense scene in which his rage suggests that he's more likely to kill her than save her, Ethan safely delivers Debbie to her father's neighbour. He doesn't, however, enter the house, silently returning to his frontier world, a wandering loner who doesn't belong in the stable world of family and relationships. And as the screen fades to black, there's a reprise of the opening music: 'A man will search his heart and soul, go searchin' way out there, his peace of mind he knows he'll find, but where, O Lord, oh where? Ride away, ride away.'</p> <h2>72: There's Something About Mary - The unusual hair-gel</h2> <p>(Bobby and Peter Farrelly, US, 1998)</p> <p>When drag terrorist Divine ate poodle excrement in John Waters' 1972 arthouse shocker Pink Flamingos, it was a milestone of sorts in cinema. At the time, it was seen by a comparatively small crowd - students, druggies, drop-outs - and reviled by the critics, which makes the mainstream success of There's Something About Mary all the more remarkable. The key point finds Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller) facing a date with his longtime fantasy girl Mary (Cameron Diaz). He's nervous, but a friend recommends masturbation as a relaxation technique. So Ted tries it, but at the crucial point he finds no sign of his issue - and Mary is at the door. Giving up his search for the missing semen, Ted goes to meet her but is horrified when she spots the errant seed swinging from his earlobe. Mistaking it for styling gel, she sweeps it into her hair, which, in the very next scene is shown to be a brittle coxcomb.<br>Unsurprisingly, the Farrelly brothers make no claim to art. \"We're not film buffs,\" says Bobby, whose Rhode Island hometown did not even boast a cinema. \"I've never seen Citizen Kane.\" Peter Farrelly, who raised eyebrows on his debut feature Dumb And Dumber by turning up to a meeting brandishing a book called How To Make A Movie, has no such pretensions either. \"We're the anti-Coens,\" he says. \"Nobody analyses our filmmaking, and we don't want them to.\"</p> <h2>73: Titanic - Lovers at the ship's bow</h2> <p>(James Cameron, US, 1997)</p> <p>Having told steerage free spirit Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) that, as an engaged woman, she cannot go on seeing him, the disenchanted, upper-crust Rose (Kate Winslet) cannot stop herself from slipping off to meet him once more. At the ship's bow, under the reddening evening sky, Jack exhorts her to step up on to the railings, outstretch her arms and lose herself in the exhilarating ocean air. 'Jack, I'm flying!' she exclaims breathlessly - though in reality Winslet and DiCaprio were flailing about on a soundstage, their footage to be integrated later with a computer-generated shot of the great liner powering across the Atlantic. Finally, to the strains of worldwide chartbuster 'My Heart Will Go On' - not to mention the chagrin of teenage girls from Oklahoma to Osaka - DiCaprio moves in for a lingering, illicit kiss. 'Pulling' as only Hollywood can do it: digital artistry and screen chemistry create the most shamelessly romantic clinch since Scarlett O'Hara snared Rhett Butler.</p> <h2>74: Zulu - The final battle</h2> <p>(Cy Endfield, UK, 1964)</p> <p>When the film's star Stanley Baker couldn't generate enough interest for the film, he decided to invest much of his own fortune in the project. Zulu was based on a true story of epic British Army resistance in Natal in 1879, when 140 soldiers successfully defended the isolated outpost at Rorke's Drift from 4,000 Zulus. Filmed on location in Natal, the second half of the film is characterised by relentless, bloody conflict, until eventually the resilient Brits, aided by good fortune and ingenuity, triumph after the final battle.<br>Initially, producer Baker couldn't persuade the Zulu extras to re-enact the fighting scenes. The chiefs hadn't seen a movie and failed to grasp what he wanted. Exasperated, Baker sent for an old Gene Autry western to illustrate what he wanted. Once they understood they were being asked to take part in make-believe, they readily agreed. </p> <h2>75: Delicatessen - The bedsprings scene</h2> <p>(Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro, Fr, 1990)</p> <p>Delicatessen is full of dazzling moments of invention, but the grand set-piece - and the one that has recently been 'borrowed' for an ad - is the bedsprings scene. It starts with former clown Louison (Dominique Pinon) trying to paint a ceiling. Upstairs, the cannibalistic butcher and his mistress collapse on to a bed with squeaky bedsprings. Louison decides he'll be able to paint better if he attaches himself to the wall with elastic and is pulled backwards and forwards. Then the camera dives down a pipe to the butcher's daughter who is playing the cello, and then we're back to the bedsprings, now squeaking in rhythm. A woman beating a carpet in another room picks up that rhythm, and so does the cello, and then a man pumping up a bicycle tyre, and the beat speeds up. The two men making the animal noise toys are also testing in time, then an old woman's knitting clicks in, and tempo increases up until finally the butcher climaxes, a cello string breaks, the tyre bursts and the elastic breaks, leaving Louison sprawling on the floor.</p> <h2>76: William Shakespeare's Romeo And Juliet - The young lovers gaze through an aquarium</h2> <p>(Baz Luhrmann, US, 1996) </p> <p>During the Nineties we saw Richard III (played by Ian McKellen) as a Nazi, and Prince Hal and Falstaff as homosexuals in Portland (My Own Private Idaho). But BazLuhrmann's MTV-style update was the most gloriously irreverent Shakespeare adaptation seen on the big screen. The Australian director stripped down the Bard's verse, transposing the action from Verona to Verona Beach, LA. Romeo, Mercutio et al sported Hawaiian shirts, carried jewelled semi-automatics and popped ecstacy tablets before the masked ball. In short, Luhrmann took a few liberties. For him the story wasstraightforward. \"It's very wild, it's very sexual. It's about two kids who have sex and commit suicide.\"</p> <p>The first significant scene between the beautiful kids, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, took place as they locked eyes through an aquarium. It is a rare moment of calm, and they appear to be gazing at their own reflections too: equating young love and narcissism, perhaps. Young audiences certainly fell in love with the film, a raft of Shakespeare-inspired high-school movies followed. None of them contained a scene to match the one in Luhrmann's West Coast Story.</p> <h2><br>77: Scarface - 'Say hello to my leetle friend'</h2> <p>(Brian DePalma, US, 1983)</p> <p>Still semi-conscious, Tony Montana (Al Pacino) comes to in his Florida crime palace, clutching the bullet-ridden body of his sister Gina. He looks at the security monitors and sees a band of hired assassins flooding into his estate, sent to kill him. 'You wanna play games?' Montana screams. 'I play games with you!' Opening his gun cabinet, he pulls out an M16 assault rifle with a grenade launcher attached. 'You wanna play rough? OK.' Suddenly the mercenaries are at the door, but Montana is ready for them. 'Say hello to my leetle friend.' The grenade blasts through the door, taking half a dozen hoods with it. 'How you like that? My new fuckin' gun!' beams Montana, by now so saturated with cocaine that when death finally comes he's too high to notice. Ridiculed on its release for its astonishing levels of profanity and violence, Scarface is now acclaimed as a scathing attack on Reaganite America. Writer Oliver Stone admitted to being shocked when a Cuban gangster applauded his realism. </p> <h2>78: Dr Strangelove - Bomb descends to 'We'll Meet Again'</h2> <p>(Stanley Kubrick, UK, 1963)</p> <p>In 1963 the Cold War was particularly icy, following the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. It was into this tense aftermath that Kubrick released Dr Strangelove, the darkest of black comedies. The deranged Colonel Jack D. Ripper seals his airbase and sends his B52 nuclear bombers to attack Russia in the hope of protecting the 'precious bodily fluids' of his American boys from Communist 'preverts' [sic].</p> <p>The leaders of both superpowers, in a surreally prescient telephone conversation, arrange to shoot down the bombers. However, one bomber, piloted by the wily Major Kong (Slim Pickens) slips into Russian territory, unaware that their attack will trigger Dr Strangelove's doomsday machine and nuclear armageddon.</p> <p>Reaction to the film varied widely. Mo Rothman, the film's executive producer at Columbia Pictures admonished Kubrick, saying, 'New York does not see anything funny about the end of the world.'</p> <p>Others thought Kubrick played too hard for laughs. Sellers originally intended to use an asthma inhaler as a prop. Every other sentence he would pause to gasp oxygen from a face mask. The effect was so funny that the crew was frequently incapacitated for the first two days of shooting and after that Kubrick ordered Sellers to play the President straight.</p> <p>But if one image can sum up the nihilistic machismo of superpower politics and the Cold War it is that of a whooping cowboy riding a plummeting, phallic nuclear bomb.</p> <p><strong>Ken Adam, production designer</strong><br>'The scene was actually two scenes. The problem was that the bomb bay had been built at Shepperton, but we had not allowed for practical use of the doors. So Ally Veevers, who went on to do most of the special effects on 2001, came up with the idea of taking a 10x8 still shot of the interior of the bomb bay and the doors, cutting them out and putting in a blue background. We then suspended the bomb on wires and superimposed it, and the Russian missile site was, in fact, a painting, eight feet by five feet, by Alan Maley.<br>It was very difficult to make the B52 because it was all so secret - we had no collaboration from the US. We got most of our information from aviation magazines like Flight and Jane. It was amazing how much detail we found. The most amusing moment was when US air force personnel, who had been invited to the studio, went white. The code device was apparently very close to something that really had been secretly developed.</p> <p>Stanley warned me to memorise my sources of information for the set in case we were taken in when we went to the US. Remember that this was just after the Cuban missile crisis and the McCarthy witchhunts weren't that long ago. Stanley was extremely paranoid. He was convinced that nuclear war could break out any second. He used to spend, literally, hours thinking about where the safest place would be if there was a nuclear war, and after calculating radiation fallout patterns and the like, he concluded that it was County Cork in the Republic of Ireland.'</p> <p><strong>Pablo Ferro, titles editor</strong><br>'Sellers was going to play Major \"King\" Kong too, but he hurt his leg. Stanley had worked with Slim Pickens before, on the film One Eyed Jacks, and thought he'd be great. However, as it was filmed in Britain, the producers wanted a British actor. Stanley told them that if they could find someone who was as tall as Slim, looked like him and could talk like him, he would take him. Of course, there was no such thing.</p> <p>The bomb-dropping scene was a very simple optical trick.

Therefore her music acts as vocal substitute, and needed to be more expressive than a conventional soundtrack. Although the film was set in colonial New Zealand, Ada hails from Scotland.

Fortunately, Hunter had learnt piano as a child but initially found playing again a 'formidable, frightening task'. Ultimately, 'I had to play so often and so much that in the end I could'. Nyman observed Hunter's hands during rehearsal and composed pieces to correspond with her style. During the scene itself, Harvey Keitel watches with bemusement and admiration as Hunter loses herself in musical rapture and her daughter, played by Anna Paquin, dances wildly.

The story involves a young boy Salvatore (Marco Leonardi) in an Italian village who enjoys a close friendship with the cinema projectionist (Philippe Noiret). The boy later becomes a distinguished director and his bitter-sweet reminiscences form the crux of the film. Much mileage is taken from the anger expressed by the fanatic cinema audiences of his youth deprived of love scenes by the censorious local priest. The film ends on a poignant note as middle-aged Salvatore (Jacques Perrin) watches a collection of edited kissing scenes he salvaged from the projectionist's floor and presumably cherished for a number of reasons.<br>Ironically, the film initially left Italian audiences cold.

      "bodyText": "71: The Searchers - Ethan Edwards' final cut (John Ford, US 1956) All but ignored by the Academy Awards on its release, The Searchers is perhaps the very epitome of the American western - certainly the perfect crystallisation of all John Ford's favoured themes and the best, most complex performance given by its star, John Wayne. Fittingly for a film about a brutal outsider, The Searchers begins and ends with a shot of an open door filmed from inside a ranch house, looking out - and both the first and last time we see Wayne's character, Ethan Edwards, he is framed by darkness. A mysterious figure whose personal background is shady and possibly criminal, Ethan vows revenge when his brother and sister-in-law are butchered by Indians and their youngest daughter, Debbie, is kidnapped. Ethan begins a five-year quest to find her, but when he does, he finds to his disgust that the child is now a young woman and acclimatised to 'her' people. Ethan is forced to confront his racism through Debbie's part-Cherokee brother Marty, who persuades her to return, and after a tense scene in which his rage suggests that he's more likely to kill her than save her, Ethan safely delivers Debbie to her father's neighbour. He doesn't, however, enter the house, silently returning to his frontier world, a wandering loner who doesn't belong in the stable world of family and relationships. And as the screen fades to black, there's a reprise of the opening music: 'A man will search his heart and soul, go searchin' way out there, his peace of mind he knows he'll find, but where, O Lord, oh where? Ride away, ride away.' 72: There's Something About Mary - The unusual hair-gel (Bobby and Peter Farrelly, US, 1998) When drag terrorist Divine ate poodle excrement in John Waters' 1972 arthouse shocker Pink Flamingos, it was a milestone of sorts in cinema. At the time, it was seen by a comparatively small crowd - students, druggies, drop-outs - and reviled by the critics, which makes the mainstream success of There's Something About Mary all the more remarkable. The key point finds Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller) facing a date with his longtime fantasy girl Mary (Cameron Diaz). He's nervous, but a friend recommends masturbation as a relaxation technique. So Ted tries it, but at the crucial point he finds no sign of his issue - and Mary is at the door. Giving up his search for the missing semen, Ted goes to meet her but is horrified when she spots the errant seed swinging from his earlobe. Mistaking it for styling gel, she sweeps it into her hair, which, in the very next scene is shown to be a brittle coxcomb. Unsurprisingly, the Farrelly brothers make no claim to art. \"We're not film buffs,\" says Bobby, whose Rhode Island hometown did not even boast a cinema. \"I've never seen Citizen Kane.\" Peter Farrelly, who raised eyebrows on his debut feature Dumb And Dumber by turning up to a meeting brandishing a book called How To Make A Movie, has no such pretensions either. \"We're the anti-Coens,\" he says. \"Nobody analyses our filmmaking, and we don't want them to.\" 73: Titanic - Lovers at the ship's bow (James Cameron, US, 1997) Having told steerage free spirit Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) that, as an engaged woman, she cannot go on seeing him, the disenchanted, upper-crust Rose (Kate Winslet) cannot stop herself from slipping off to meet him once more. At the ship's bow, under the reddening evening sky, Jack exhorts her to step up on to the railings, outstretch her arms and lose herself in the exhilarating ocean air. 'Jack, I'm flying!' she exclaims breathlessly - though in reality Winslet and DiCaprio were flailing about on a soundstage, their footage to be integrated later with a computer-generated shot of the great liner powering across the Atlantic. Finally, to the strains of worldwide chartbuster 'My Heart Will Go On' - not to mention the chagrin of teenage girls from Oklahoma to Osaka - DiCaprio moves in for a lingering, illicit kiss. 'Pulling' as only Hollywood can do it: digital artistry and screen chemistry create the most shamelessly romantic clinch since Scarlett O'Hara snared Rhett Butler. 74: Zulu - The final battle (Cy Endfield, UK, 1964) When the film's star Stanley Baker couldn't generate enough interest for the film, he decided to invest much of his own fortune in the project. Zulu was based on a true story of epic British Army resistance in Natal in 1879, when 140 soldiers successfully defended the isolated outpost at Rorke's Drift from 4,000 Zulus. Filmed on location in Natal, the second half of the film is characterised by relentless, bloody conflict, until eventually the resilient Brits, aided by good fortune and ingenuity, triumph after the final battle. Initially, producer Baker couldn't persuade the Zulu extras to re-enact the fighting scenes. The chiefs hadn't seen a movie and failed to grasp what he wanted. Exasperated, Baker sent for an old Gene Autry western to illustrate what he wanted. Once they understood they were being asked to take part in make-believe, they readily agreed. 75: Delicatessen - The bedsprings scene (Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro, Fr, 1990) Delicatessen is full of dazzling moments of invention, but the grand set-piece - and the one that has recently been 'borrowed' for an ad - is the bedsprings scene. It starts with former clown Louison (Dominique Pinon) trying to paint a ceiling. Upstairs, the cannibalistic butcher and his mistress collapse on to a bed with squeaky bedsprings. Louison decides he'll be able to paint better if he attaches himself to the wall with elastic and is pulled backwards and forwards. Then the camera dives down a pipe to the butcher's daughter who is playing the cello, and then we're back to the bedsprings, now squeaking in rhythm. A woman beating a carpet in another room picks up that rhythm, and so does the cello, and then a man pumping up a bicycle tyre, and the beat speeds up. The two men making the animal noise toys are also testing in time, then an old woman's knitting clicks in, and tempo increases up until finally the butcher climaxes, a cello string breaks, the tyre bursts and the elastic breaks, leaving Louison sprawling on the floor. 76: William Shakespeare's Romeo And Juliet - The young lovers gaze through an aquarium (Baz Luhrmann, US, 1996) During the Nineties we saw Richard III (played by Ian McKellen) as a Nazi, and Prince Hal and Falstaff as homosexuals in Portland (My Own Private Idaho). But BazLuhrmann's MTV-style update was the most gloriously irreverent Shakespeare adaptation seen on the big screen. The Australian director stripped down the Bard's verse, transposing the action from Verona to Verona Beach, LA. Romeo, Mercutio et al sported Hawaiian shirts, carried jewelled semi-automatics and popped ecstacy tablets before the masked ball. In short, Luhrmann took a few liberties. For him the story wasstraightforward. \"It's very wild, it's very sexual. It's about two kids who have sex and commit suicide.\" The first significant scene between the beautiful kids, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, took place as they locked eyes through an aquarium. It is a rare moment of calm, and they appear to be gazing at their own reflections too: equating young love and narcissism, perhaps. Young audiences certainly fell in love with the film, a raft of Shakespeare-inspired high-school movies followed. None of them contained a scene to match the one in Luhrmann's West Coast Story. 77: Scarface - 'Say hello to my leetle friend' (Brian DePalma, US, 1983) Still semi-conscious, Tony Montana (Al Pacino) comes to in his Florida crime palace, clutching the bullet-ridden body of his sister Gina. He looks at the security monitors and sees a band of hired assassins flooding into his estate, sent to kill him. 'You wanna play games?' Montana screams. 'I play games with you!' Opening his gun cabinet, he pulls out an M16 assault rifle with a grenade launcher attached. 'You wanna play rough? OK.' Suddenly the mercenaries are at the door, but Montana is ready for them. 'Say hello to my leetle friend.' The grenade blasts through the door, taking half a dozen hoods with it. 'How you like that? My new fuckin' gun!' beams Montana, by now so saturated with cocaine that when death finally comes he's too high to notice. Ridiculed on its release for its astonishing levels of profanity and violence, Scarface is now acclaimed as a scathing attack on Reaganite America. Writer Oliver Stone admitted to being shocked when a Cuban gangster applauded his realism. 78: Dr Strangelove - Bomb descends to 'We'll Meet Again' (Stanley Kubrick, UK, 1963) In 1963 the Cold War was particularly icy, following the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. It was into this tense aftermath that Kubrick released Dr Strangelove, the darkest of black comedies. The deranged Colonel Jack D. Ripper seals his airbase and sends his B52 nuclear bombers to attack Russia in the hope of protecting the 'precious bodily fluids' of his American boys from Communist 'preverts' [sic]. The leaders of both superpowers, in a surreally prescient telephone conversation, arrange to shoot down the bombers. However, one bomber, piloted by the wily Major Kong (Slim Pickens) slips into Russian territory, unaware that their attack will trigger Dr Strangelove's doomsday machine and nuclear armageddon. Reaction to the film varied widely. Mo Rothman, the film's executive producer at Columbia Pictures admonished Kubrick, saying, 'New York does not see anything funny about the end of the world.' Others thought Kubrick played too hard for laughs. Sellers originally intended to use an asthma inhaler as a prop. Every other sentence he would pause to gasp oxygen from a face mask. The effect was so funny that the crew was frequently incapacitated for the first two days of shooting and after that Kubrick ordered Sellers to play the President straight. But if one image can sum up the nihilistic machismo of superpower politics and the Cold War it is that of a whooping cowboy riding a plummeting, phallic nuclear bomb. Ken Adam, production designer 'The scene was actually two scenes. The problem was that the bomb bay had been built at Shepperton, but we had not allowed for practical use of the doors. So Ally Veevers, who went on to do most of the special effects on 2001, came up with the idea of taking a 10x8 still shot of the interior of the bomb bay and the doors, cutting them out and putting in a blue background. We then suspended the bomb on wires and superimposed it, and the Russian missile site was, in fact, a painting, eight feet by five feet, by Alan Maley. It was very difficult to make the B52 because it was all so secret - we had no collaboration from the US. We got most of our information from aviation magazines like Flight and Jane. It was amazing how much detail we found. The most amusing moment was when US air force personnel, who had been invited to the studio, went white. The code device was apparently very close to something that really had been secretly developed. Stanley warned me to memorise my sources of information for the set in case we were taken in when we went to the US. Remember that this was just after the Cuban missile crisis and the McCarthy witchhunts weren't that long ago. Stanley was extremely paranoid. He was convinced that nuclear war could break out any second. He used to spend, literally, hours thinking about where the safest place would be if there was a nuclear war, and after calculating radiation fallout patterns and the like, he concluded that it was County Cork in the Republic of Ireland.' Pablo Ferro, titles editor 'Sellers was going to play Major \"King\" Kong too, but he hurt his leg. Stanley had worked with Slim Pickens before, on the film One Eyed Jacks, and thought he'd be great. However, as it was filmed in Britain, the producers wanted a British actor. Stanley told them that if they could find someone who was as tall as Slim, looked like him and could talk like him, he would take him. Of course, there was no such thing. The bomb-dropping scene was a very simple optical trick. I think the idea for it came with Slim - he used to be a rodeo clown, the guy who acts as a diversion when the riders fall off. Veevers did a great job and even put in some cloud, which was very subtle.' Michael Foot, former Leader of the Labour Party; at the time an anti-nuclear campaigner 'Jill Craigie [Foot's late wife] and I met Stanley Kubrick before he made the film. Jill, who really knew about film, talked with Stanley. She was always a Kubrick fan, or even pupil, and later received a nice letter from him. I also think he might have learnt something from her. She used to say that very few practitioners of the medium were good enough: Chaplin was one, and Kubrick another.

Therefore her music acts as vocal substitute, and needed to be more expressive than a conventional soundtrack. Although the film was set in colonial New Zealand, Ada hails from Scotland.

During the scene itself, Harvey Keitel watches with bemusement and admiration as Hunter loses herself in musical rapture and her daughter, played by Anna Paquin, dances wildly. The seeds of his infatuation are sown. 80: Cinema Paradiso - Compilation of love scenes (Giuseppe Tornatore, It/Fr 1988) Cinema Paradiso was destined to be on this list. There have been plenty of memorable films about making movies but nothing that captures their magical effect on audiences like this one. The film is not shy of clich\u00e9s or artless plot devices, but the overall package is so enjoyable it's easy to forget the emotional manipulation.

In 1990, Tim Burton, 31, held the honour. Fresh from the success of Batman, a textbook late Eighties blockbuster - big stars + big bangs = big bucks - he could do anything. He opted to make Edward Scissorhands, based on an idea he had cherished since childhood. Warner Bros, understandably, wanted a sequel. They would have to wait.</p> <p>Despite Burton's hip status, only one studio, 20th Century Fox, wanted to make the film. The dark fairytale, set in an identikit, pastel suburbia, looked askance at Reagan's middle-America filled with smiling jocks and Avon ladies. The hero (Johnny Depp) was a reed-thin enigma, not unlike Burton himself. Destined never to score a winning touchdown, he would puncture the ball just by picking it up. But Edward inspired affection for his noble heart and imagination. He transformed the local gardens into a gallery of topiaries, from dolphins to dinosaurs. It won him friends among the neighbourhood watch brigade. Gaining the heart of cheerleader Winona Ryder was trickier. Unable to touch her, creating ice sculptures while she danced through the snow to Danny Elfman's overwhelming score became his love token. </p> <h2>82: Babette's Feast - The old general tastes the food</h2> <p>(Gabriel Axel, Denmark, 1987)</p> <p>The sight of an old man enjoying his dinner doesn't immediately suggest itself as one the greatest moments in cinema. But what a spread: foie gras, turtle soup, quail stuffed with truffles, followed by baba au rhum and washed down with champagne. It's enough to make a man sit back and re-evaluate his life, which is exactly what happens to General Lowenhielm (Jarl Kulle) in this scene.<br>The film tells the story of a mysterious French emigr\u00e9e Babette (Stephanie Audran) who is taken in by two elderly spinster sisters in 1871. Over the years, an unlikely bond grows between the Frenchwoman, who works as their housemaid, and her pious, yet kindly benefactors. When Babette wins the lottery, she decides to cook a fabulous feast for the dour villagers. By agreeing, the sisters risk the wrath of their puritanical fellow parishioners. The seven-course delight is politely received until the memories stirred by the culinary magnificence prove too much for Lowenhielm, leading to the revelation of old secrets and a measure of catharsis. </p> <h2>83: The Jungle Book - Mowgli meets Baloo</h2> <p>(Wolfgang Reitherman, US, 1967)</p> <p>The 17th and last animated feature personally produced by Walt Disney seemed in synch with the Swinging Sixties. Four years since the last Disney feature, The Sword in the Stone, the studio's panoramic animation was largely absent, relying on catchy jazz-inspired songs and the interaction of memorable characters. Rudyard Kipling's stories about a boy raised by wolves had been liberally adapted by the filmmakers. When jovial Baloo meets Mowgli, 'Well, what have we here then?' it marks the start of one of the film's central relationship and was another excuse for a song, 'The Bare Necessities'. Bandleader and radio star Phil Harris, who voiced Baloo, was a household name in the States, with Bruce Reitherman as Mowgli. He was the son of director Wolfgang Reitherman, Disney's favourite animation director. He was one of the 'nine old men', the original group of animators who worked on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.</p> <h2>84: Henry V - Henry carries away his dead page</h2> <p>(Kenneth Branagh, UK, 1989)</p> <p>Arguably Hollywood's favourite screenwriter during the Nineties, the Bard's resurgence owed much to the efforts of Branagh, Oscar-nominated here in his directorial debut. Branagh retained period costumes but updated the play with a modern sensibility. No longer was Hal purely a two-dimensional war-monger driven by staunch patriotism. Lawrence Olivier's famous adaptation was aimed at boosting British spirits during World War II. Over 40 years later in peacetime, Branagh had no such constraints, bringing greater realism and violence to his version. Audiences familiar with Olivier's version were in for a surprise. Of course, the 'Once more unto the breach' speech was delivered with customary rigour, but Branagh's battleground was a muddy hellhole. There was little place for vainglory in this world. Therefore Observer readers were stirred by a less obvious moment of heroism and leadership. It takes place after the battle, when Henry staggers across the fields, strewn with corpses, carrying the youthful body of his dead page on his shoulders. The warrior king goes on to eventual victory but the terrible cost of battle is an indelible memory.</p> <h2>85: La Dolce Vita - The frolic in the fountain</h2> <p>(Federico Fellini, It/Fr 1960)</p> <p>Fellini's classic marked a highpoint of European cinema, supporting the auteur theory of filmmaking beloved of contemporary French critics. The film lambasted the decadent values of post-war Rome and views the city's landmarks with a sardonic eye. From the opening scene, when a statue of Christ is carried above Rome by a helicopter, the director's iconoclastic vision is set. For much of the film, Mastroianni's handsome yet dissolute tabloid reporter chases stories and women, often in tandem, as in the film's most memorable scene. Covering the arrival of a buxom movie star (Anita Ekberg), he follows her across the the city spectrum, from the top of St Peter's to a dingy nightclub. He is smitten despite her obvious shortcomings: earlier asked the secret of her success, she points to her chest, proudly declaring: 'Because I've discovered I've got great talent.' The passionate pursuit ends at dawn, as he follows her into the Trevi fountain. By now he has elevated the actress to the epitome of her sex, but is still unable to reach her.</p> <h2>86: Cabaret - Tomorrow belongs to them</h2> <p>(Bob Fosse, US, 1972)</p> <p>By 1972, Bob Fosse had an enviable reputation as a Broadway producer and choreographer - talents that were showcased impressively in his 1969 film debut, Sweet Charity. Fosse's flair was better served by Cabaret, however, which allowed him more leeway with his often underrated dramatic sensibility although it irritated many of the original stage musical admirers, who felt Jay Presson Allen's script owed far too much to Christopher Isherwood's source play I Am A Camera.</p> <p>Set in Thirties Berlin, the film stars Liza Minnelli as Sally Bowles, an ex-pat American singer who performs lewd routines in the seedy Kit Kat Club. Sally meets Brian (Michael York), a genteel British writer, and together they meet Maximillian (Helmut Griem), a suave, rich Berliner who romances them both with no apparent preference.</p> <p>Against this decadent backdrop, Fosse plays out the rise of Nazism, using the song and dance routines as an eerie reflection of its methods and doctrine. Most chilling of all, however, is the scene in a rural Biergarten, where an angelic young blond boy in his early teens stands up and begins to sing the plaintive 'Tomorrow Belongs To Me'. It starts as a gentle, childish song of hope but, slowly, more and more of the people around him join in. The elephantine clatter of a traditional oompah band picks up the beat, until the song reaches a powerful, marching crescendo - every man, woman and child is in thrall to the tempo, making all Brian's philosophical musings redundant and hammering home the growing support for Adolf Hitler with the simple revelation of a single swastika on the original boy's clothing.</p> <h2>87: Un Chien Andalou - Eye-slicing</h2> <p>(Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Salvador Dali, Sp, 1928)</p> <p>In 1928, Luis Bu\u00f1uel made cinema history with a simple trip to the butcher's. As a student at university in Madrid, Bu\u00f1uel had made friends with aspiring artist Salvador Dali, and together they conceived what would become famous as the first true Surrealist movie. The opening was designed to shock, showing a man (played by Bu\u00f1uel himself) sharpening his razor until it glistens. Next we see him standing behind a woman, who is sitting nonchalantly on a chair, and prising her eyelids apart with his fingers. The next scene is the clincher, showing the razor slicing through the aqueous humour, a horribly realistic effect achieved by using a cow's eye for the close-up. The random, frequently hilarious scenes that follow 'a man dragging two grand pianos stuffed with dead donkeys, another man staring in horror at the colony of ants living in his hand' make even less sense over the course of the next 17 minutes, but the film achieved its aim and the pair teamed for a second Surrealist classic, L'Age D'Or (1930). This time the subject was religion, and its scurrilous nature threatened to damage Bu\u00f1uel's career.</p> <p>After a slack period during the Thirties, Bu\u00f1uel moved to Los Angeles and later, in the Forties, to Mexico, partly inspired by right-wing dictator General Franco's success in the Spanish Civil War, although he returned to Spain in 1961 at Franco's personal request. His first film back in his homeland, Viridiana, was a religious satire culminating in an irreverent recreation of The Last Supper. Franco was not impressed. </p> <h2>88: Four Weddings And A Funeral - The W. H. Auden recital</h2> <p>(Mike Newell, UK, 1994)</p> <p>Never mind the Weddings, the Funeral was the narrative masterstroke of Richard Curtis's five-act comedy of manners, in that it tied a counterweight to the otherwise gossamer larks. 'Splendid bugger' Gareth (Simon Callow) has suffered a fatal heart attack at the previous wedding, and at his funeral, his partner Matthew (John Hannah) says 'a few words'. It is a moving speech, not least for Curtis's inclusion of W. H. Auden's 'Song IX'.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the poem was republished and snapped up by people who had never bought a poetry book in their lives. This illustrates the power of the scene, the credit for which remains a dead heat between Auden and Hannah (who also benefited, in that he turned into a leading man). 'Perhaps you will forgive me,' he says, 'If I turn from my own feelings to the words of another splendid bugger, W. H. Auden.</p> <p>'Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone. Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone. Silence the pianos and with muffled drum / Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come?'</p> <p>He continues, 'Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood; for nothing now can ever come to any good.'</p> <h2>89: Great Expectations - Pip meets Magwitch in the graveyard</h2> <p>(David Lean, UK, 1946)</p> <p>These days, Dickens seems to be an excuse for TV prop departments to show off and for the BBC's better-paid stars to indulge in scenery munching cameos. But David Lean's Great Expectations is something else entirely: an often terrifying Gothic tale that had a marked influence on Sunset Boulevard.<br>It starts with young Pip (Anthony Wager) running across truly bleak, dead marshes, with the wind howling, and a pair of gallows the only sign of human habitation. He climbs a wall into a crumbling graveyard, with a loud creaking in the background. He visits his parents' grave, but the creaking has made him nervous, and he keeps looking round. He starts to run away but his throat has been seized by a vast, ugly man with a huge bulbous nose.</p> <p>'Keep still, you little devil, or I'll cut your throat.' Magwitch (Finlay Currie) lifts Pip up, turns him upside down and shakes his pockets out. Then he interrogates Pip about his family.</p> <p>'Get me a file and vittles or I'll have your heart and liver out.' Pip believes him: equally importantly, so do we. There are few scarier moments in British cinema.</p> <h2>90: Happiness - The, er, climax</h2> <p>(Todd Solondz, US, 1998)</p> <p>Billy Maplewood has it tough. First, the kids at school tease him because he hasn't managed to 'come' yet - in fact, he doesn't know what 'coming' means, until he asks his obliging father Bill, a psychiatrist. Worse is to come when it is revealed that Maplewood Snr is a closet paedophile who has been drugging and raping Billy's playmates. Billy's mother takes him back to live with her parents, and at a family meal, Billy masturbates for the first time and earnestly tells the horrified diners: 'I came!' Those familiar with director Solondz's debut, school-year cringe comedy, Welcome To The Dollhouse, will recognise his trademark black comedy, but Happiness certainly pushes the envelope.<br>'Many people have walked out of Dollhouse and said, \"Oh, that was me\",' says Solondz. 'I don't anticipate anyone walking out and saying, \"That was me, I was Bill Maplewood.\" But for me the tragedy of Bill Maplewood is his family: he loves his wife, he loves his son. He's not a monster but struggles with a monster within, and he succumbs to this demon, so to speak.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "81: Edward Scissorhands - Ice sculptures (Tim Burton, US, 1991) It's an annual event, Hollywood crowning 'This year's hottest director'. In 1990, Tim Burton, 31, held the honour. Fresh from the success of Batman, a textbook late Eighties blockbuster - big stars + big bangs = big bucks - he could do anything. He opted to make Edward Scissorhands, based on an idea he had cherished since childhood. Warner Bros, understandably, wanted a sequel. They would have to wait. Despite Burton's hip status, only one studio, 20th Century Fox, wanted to make the film. The dark fairytale, set in an identikit, pastel suburbia, looked askance at Reagan's middle-America filled with smiling jocks and Avon ladies. The hero (Johnny Depp) was a reed-thin enigma, not unlike Burton himself. Destined never to score a winning touchdown, he would puncture the ball just by picking it up. But Edward inspired affection for his noble heart and imagination. He transformed the local gardens into a gallery of topiaries, from dolphins to dinosaurs. It won him friends among the neighbourhood watch brigade. Gaining the heart of cheerleader Winona Ryder was trickier. Unable to touch her, creating ice sculptures while she danced through the snow to Danny Elfman's overwhelming score became his love token. 82: Babette's Feast - The old general tastes the food (Gabriel Axel, Denmark, 1987) The sight of an old man enjoying his dinner doesn't immediately suggest itself as one the greatest moments in cinema. But what a spread: foie gras, turtle soup, quail stuffed with truffles, followed by baba au rhum and washed down with champagne. It's enough to make a man sit back and re-evaluate his life, which is exactly what happens to General Lowenhielm (Jarl Kulle) in this scene. The film tells the story of a mysterious French emigr\u00e9e Babette (Stephanie Audran) who is taken in by two elderly spinster sisters in 1871. Over the years, an unlikely bond grows between the Frenchwoman, who works as their housemaid, and her pious, yet kindly benefactors. When Babette wins the lottery, she decides to cook a fabulous feast for the dour villagers. By agreeing, the sisters risk the wrath of their puritanical fellow parishioners. The seven-course delight is politely received until the memories stirred by the culinary magnificence prove too much for Lowenhielm, leading to the revelation of old secrets and a measure of catharsis. 83: The Jungle Book - Mowgli meets Baloo (Wolfgang Reitherman, US, 1967) The 17th and last animated feature personally produced by Walt Disney seemed in synch with the Swinging Sixties. Four years since the last Disney feature, The Sword in the Stone, the studio's panoramic animation was largely absent, relying on catchy jazz-inspired songs and the interaction of memorable characters. Rudyard Kipling's stories about a boy raised by wolves had been liberally adapted by the filmmakers. When jovial Baloo meets Mowgli, 'Well, what have we here then?' it marks the start of one of the film's central relationship and was another excuse for a song, 'The Bare Necessities'. Bandleader and radio star Phil Harris, who voiced Baloo, was a household name in the States, with Bruce Reitherman as Mowgli. He was the son of director Wolfgang Reitherman, Disney's favourite animation director. He was one of the 'nine old men', the original group of animators who worked on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. 84: Henry V - Henry carries away his dead page (Kenneth Branagh, UK, 1989) Arguably Hollywood's favourite screenwriter during the Nineties, the Bard's resurgence owed much to the efforts of Branagh, Oscar-nominated here in his directorial debut. Branagh retained period costumes but updated the play with a modern sensibility. No longer was Hal purely a two-dimensional war-monger driven by staunch patriotism. Lawrence Olivier's famous adaptation was aimed at boosting British spirits during World War II. Over 40 years later in peacetime, Branagh had no such constraints, bringing greater realism and violence to his version. Audiences familiar with Olivier's version were in for a surprise. Of course, the 'Once more unto the breach' speech was delivered with customary rigour, but Branagh's battleground was a muddy hellhole. There was little place for vainglory in this world. Therefore Observer readers were stirred by a less obvious moment of heroism and leadership. It takes place after the battle, when Henry staggers across the fields, strewn with corpses, carrying the youthful body of his dead page on his shoulders. The warrior king goes on to eventual victory but the terrible cost of battle is an indelible memory. 85: La Dolce Vita - The frolic in the fountain (Federico Fellini, It/Fr 1960) Fellini's classic marked a highpoint of European cinema, supporting the auteur theory of filmmaking beloved of contemporary French critics. The film lambasted the decadent values of post-war Rome and views the city's landmarks with a sardonic eye. From the opening scene, when a statue of Christ is carried above Rome by a helicopter, the director's iconoclastic vision is set. For much of the film, Mastroianni's handsome yet dissolute tabloid reporter chases stories and women, often in tandem, as in the film's most memorable scene.

The passionate pursuit ends at dawn, as he follows her into the Trevi fountain. By now he has elevated the actress to the epitome of her sex, but is still unable to reach her. 86: Cabaret - Tomorrow belongs to them (Bob Fosse, US, 1972) By 1972, Bob Fosse had an enviable reputation as a Broadway producer and choreographer - talents that were showcased impressively in his 1969 film debut, Sweet Charity.

The filming required 30 days' shooting, 10 cameras and 3,000 extras. He concentrated on capturing the violence of the conflict, zooming in on the brutal hand-to-hand fighting and the carnage. During editing, Gibson worried that some battle scenes were too strong, and was proved correct when people walked out of a preview screening, causing him to cut some of the gore. 'You don't want to gross people out,' he admitted at the time, 'but I think they have to feel what a 13th-century battle was like. It can't be a comfortable experience, people slugging each other with blunt weapons.'</p> <h2>92: High Noon - Will Kane realises he is alone</h2> <p>(Fred Zinnemann, US, 1952))</p> <p>Having had his call for volunteers rejected in both the saloon and the church, sheriff Will Kane (Gary Cooper) returns to his office and has to tell his one temporary deputy, Herb, that they're going to have to stand alone.<br>'You and me against Miller and all the rest of 'em?...I'm ready now, but this is different, Will. This ain't like what you said it was gonna be. This is just plain committing suicide and for what? Why me? I'm no lawman. I just live here. I got nothin' personal against nobody. I got no stake in this? There's a limit how much you can ask a man. I got a wife and kids.'</p> <p>Kane lets Herb go and lets his weary head rest against his desk. A teenage boy tries to help Kane, but it's clear he'll have to stand alone. When the clock turns to noon, he gets up and walks out into the street. But even then he's no fighting machine: he's an anxious, ailing middle-aged man, glancing nervously around. And all the more heroic for it.</p> <h2>93: Ice Cold In Alex - 'Four ice-cold lagers'</h2> <p>(J. Lee Thompson, UK, 1958)</p> <p>The title comes from a pledge that (alcoholic) British officer Captain Anson (John Mills) makes to the crew of his ambulance as they brave the Germans, the Sahara and the spy they have in their ranks, trying to get from Tobruk to Alexandria: if they make it, they'll have the best beer in the world.<br>Battered, dusty, weary and expectant, the survivors: Anson, the sergeant (Harry Andrews), Diana, the nurse (Sylvia Syms) and the Nazi spy (Anthony Quayle) who has actually saved them, troop into Anson's favourite bar and take their stools.</p> <p>'Set 'em up Joe,' Anson requests, as if he'd been in the day before.<br>'Set what up?' the barman asks.<br>'Four ice-cold lagers.'<br>The quartet look tense as the barman pours the drinks.<br>'You've kept your promise,' Diana says.<br>'Let's hope the beer is all I said it was.'<br>The barman lines up four glasses of frothy lager. Anson looks at his for a long time, thinking back on the long, shambolic and dangerous trip across the desert. He picks up the glass, sinking it in one. 'Worth waiting for.'</p> <h2>94: Les Diaboliques - He rises from the dead</h2> <p>(Henri-Georges Clouzot, Fr, 1955)</p> <p>'Don't be devils. Don't ruin the interest your friends could take in this film. Don't tell them what you saw.' (Henri-Georges Clouzot's post-film voiceover.)<br>Is this the one film Alfred Hitchcock wished he had directed himself? In retrospect, he probably regretted turning it down. Instead, Henri-Georges Clouzot stepped in to direct the classic pot-boiler. The resulting film was the first art-house hit in America, inspiring round-the-block queues. The appeal: dark humour, a hint of supernatural mystery, a foreboding atmosphere topped off with a memorable twist lured many mainstream moviegoers to their first foreign language film.</p> <p>Ironically, Hitchcock was inspired by the film when he came to direct Psycho in 1960, Les Diaboliques' marketing ploy, urging people not to reveal the ending, proved wise both times.</p> <p>After being drowned by his long-suffering wife, Christina (Vera Clouzot), and vengeful mistress Nicole (Simone Signoret), callous headmaster Paul Meurisse (Michel Delasalle) is spotted around the school. A botched job or something more sinister? Nothing is quite as it seems, of course. At the end of the film, the headmaster rises again out of the tub, soaked but unapparently unharmed, although his pupils are missing from his eyes. His slow ascent is terrifying, deepening the mystery about his mortality. Is he man or monster? The Hitchcock link continued after the release of Psycho when he received a letter from a distraught fan. 'Sir, After seeing Diabolique [sic], my daughter was afraid to take a bath. Now she has seen your Psycho and is afraid to take a shower. What should I do with her?' Hitchcock replied: 'Send her to the dry cleaners'.</p> <h2>95: Schindler's List - The girl's red coat</h2> <p>(Steven Spielberg, US, 1993)</p> <p>This heartbreaking sequence relates to the earlier 'Rosebud' moment in Schindler's List. During the Krakow ghetto clearance, the girl in the red coat had dodged through the carnage, ignored by everyone, as Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) watched in growing horror. In the film it marked a turning point for the industrialist, pushing him to risk his life and fortune rescuing potential camp victims. The red coat, conspicuous in an otherwise black and white film, draws our attention to the anonymous girl. At the end of the sequence she slips into an empty house and hides under a bed. However, her ultimate fate is still tragic. Later, we catch a glimpse of the coat in a cart piled high with corpses.</p> <p>Apparently the arc of this particular story caused a stir between Spielberg and screenwriter Steven Zaillian who worried the sequence was too sentimental. The film was released to almost universal praise but prominent Jewish American critics were not won over. Writing in the Village Voice, J. Hoberman thought the film focused too heavily on Schindler's heroics relegating Jews 'to supporting parts in their own cataclysm, hanging around the Krakow ghetto'. The film, he argued, was 'a feel-good entertainment about the ultimate feel-bad experience of the 20th century'.</p> <h2>96: Cool Hand Luke - The egg-eating contest</h2> <p>(Stuart Rosenberg, US, 1967)</p> <p>Non-conformist convict Lucas 'Luke' Jackson (Paul Newman) is a good ole Southern boy whose spirit can't be broken. He arrives in prison and becomes a messiah figure in the eyes of his peers, earning their respect by challenging the prison establishment and, in the film's signature scene, scoffing boiled eggs to win a wager.</p> <p>Luke's pal Dragline (George Kennedy) makes a bet with the other prisoners that he can eat 50 eggs in an hour. The men are confident Luke can't do it. 'Fifty eggs gotta weigh a good six pounds? A man's gut can't hold that. They'll swell up and bust him open?'</p> <p>'They're gonna kill him,' says one as he throws his money down. Following a couple of humorous eating exercises, stretching his stomach's skin, Luke is ready. After eating 32 eggs rapidly, he looks beat. But his feeding fatigue is a ploy to drum up more betting interest. 'I wanna hear from some big money men. Where's all the high rollers?' asks Dragline. 'I believe you've got it all, Dragline. Every cent in camp is riding,' comes the reply.</p> <p>Luke eventually reaches the target, but the punters aren't happy he swallowed the last egg within the time limit. They examine his mouth before laying the exhausted victor on a table covered in egg shells. An overhead camera looks down, Luke's arms are outstretched, his legs are crossed and his head is tilted in a crucifixion pose. The deification is complete.</p> <h2>97: The Thomas Crown Affair - The chess game</h2> <p>(Norman Jewison, US, 1967)</p> <p>Steve McQueen was never hired for his command of dialogue. Think of his defining roles - The Great Escape, Bullitt - and you'll notice he barely says anything. So it is with this six-minutes-plus sequence. Crown is a suave millionaire who organises heists for the hell of it; Vicki Anderson (Faye Dunaway) is the absurdly stylish insurance investigator who is on his case. Crown has invited Vicki to his mansion, and she is wandering round his study - open fire roaring in the background - when she spots his chess set.<br>'Do you play?' Crown asks. <br>'Try me.'<br>For a while, they concentrate on the game. Then Vicki starts stroking her arms. <br>Crown plays with his lips. The camera focuses on her fantastic false eyelashes, then her ultra-pink lips. She slips a finger into her mouth - there's nothing subtle here - and strokes a chess piece. Their legs meet under the table.<br>'Check,' she says, breaking several minutes without dialogue. He gets up, wanders round the table and pulls her up to him. <br>'Let's play something else.' What follows is the longest kiss in film history.</p> <p>You can argue the 1999 remake is a better film. And maybe McQueen was miscast as the millionaire - the part was apparently intended for Sean Connery, which indirectly might explain why Pierce Brosnan was chosen for the remake. But as super-stylised Sixties decadence, the chess scene is hard to beat. </p> <h2>98: Bambi - The death of Bambi's mother</h2> <p>(David D. Hand, US, 1942)</p> <p>It's the cute schtick with Thumper, or else 'Drip-drip-drop little April showers', that they always show on Disney Time at bank holidays. But we all know which bit of Bambi is really imprinted on our collective memory: the clip they never show.</p> <p>Bambi predated The Lion King's famed 'Circle Of Life' theme by half a century. It begins and ends with a birth and deals with the death of a parent along the way, as we watch Bambi grow from doe-eyed innocent through to antlered defender of his new mate's honour. But, three-quarters of an hour into the film, it is the death of Bambi's mother that provides the narrative pivot.</p> <p>A premonition is provided when Great Prince Of The Forest (Bambi's dad) rescues his young heir from being shot. Searching for an explanation, Mother explains, bluntly, 'Man was in the forest.' (Released after the US had entered World War II, the message was clear.)</p> <p>Spring comes, and Man enters the forest once again. This time, Bambi escapes and assumes his mother is right behind him. 'We made it!' he exclaims. 'We made it, Mother! We? Mother?'</p> <p>The Great Prince explains, 'Your Mother can't be with you any more. Man has taken her away.'</p> <p>For a screen death that happens off-screen, it is a tear-jerker to beat them all. </p> <h2>99: The Sound Of Music - 'The hills are alive'</h2> <p>(Robert Wise, US, 1965)</p> <p>The scene is idyllic; as the camera races over the Austrian mountains, we catch sight of a distant figure, at first just a speck, then identifiably a woman in a plain black pinafore dress. As the music builds, the camera swoops and the woman spins round ecstatically, launching into one of the most famous songs in musical history: 'The hills are alive?'</p> <p>Based on the true story of the Von Trapp family, who were the subject of a hit German film in 1956, The Sound Of Music was premiered as a Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical in 1959, rapidly becoming one of Broadway's biggest shows in the early Sixties. But although the film's reputation is now sealed, its star, 28-year-old Julie Andrews, was quite a risk at the time. Despite having over 10 years' stage experience, Andrews had only starred in a single movie (Mary Poppins). Co-star Christopher Plummer was not first choice either; when the project was being developed by director William Wyler, the role was considered as a vehicle for Yul Brynner, presumably in a bid to replicate the success of Rodgers and Hammerstein's The King And I. </p> <h2>100: Heat - Neil McCauley and Vincent Hanna first meet</h2> <p>(Michael Mann, US, 1995)</p> <p>McCauley: Maybe we should both be doing something else pal.<br>Hanna: I don't know how to do anything else.<br>McCauley: Neither do I.<br>Hanna: I don't much want too either.<br>McCauley: Neither do I.<br>The first onscreen match-up between acting heavyweights Robert De Niro and Al Pacino is the highlight of this epic cops and robbers movie. Dogged policeman Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is on the trail of big-time thief Neil McCauley (De Niro) in Los Angeles, but audiences had to wait until halfway through the three-hour film to see them together. After tailing McCauley's car, to no avail, Hanna pulls his adversary over and asks if he can buy him a cup of coffee at a nearby diner. McCauley accepts. The two men then face each other across a table, sipping coffee, and discovering they have quite a lot in common. This simple scene illustrates the theme of Mann's film: the symmetry between cop and criminal.</p> <p>Amazingly, the actors didn't rehearse the scene before shooting it. 'We just read it through a couple of times, very mechanically, because if the magic's gonna show up, I want it on the film, not in my office,' explained Mann. Rather than use elaborate camera movement in the scene, Mann concentrated on the actors' faces, intercutting between them. The background was neutral so nothing distracted the eye from the performances. Although Pacino and De Niro had earlier shared billing in The Godfather: Part II, De Niro only appeared in the flashback scenes without his Heat co-star. </p> <p>The joint appearance of arguably the two greatest actors of their generation dominated Heat's pre-release publicity. The scene was based on an incident told to Mann by his friend Chuck Adamson. He was the policeman who shot dead the real McCauley in Chicago in 1963. The real-life protagonists had met once, shared coffee and enjoyed each other's company. 'There was a real rapport between them; yet both men recognised one would probably kill the other. And subsequently Chuck was called out to an armed robbery and shot him six times,' says Mann. 'But it was the intimacy and mutual rapport that became the nucleus of the film.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>It has been pushed off the literary map for 200 years, but now Somerset is fighting back. It is about to wage a campaign to reclaim the Romantic poets, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, from the Lake District. </p> <p>Galvanised by a new film about the two radical writers, which has just been shot on location in the area, the West Country is feeling bullish.

      "bodyText": "It has been pushed off the literary map for 200 years, but now Somerset is fighting back. It is about to wage a campaign to reclaim the Romantic poets, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, from the Lake District. Galvanised by a new film about the two radical writers, which has just been shot on location in the area, the West Country is feeling bullish. 'I suppose it is surprising that we have not made this link clear before,' said Elaine Ford, one of those working for recognition of Somerset's stake in the so-called 'Lakeland Poets'. 'We certainly have a very special story down here, and I believe people will find it fascinating to come and see some of the places that really inspired these poems.

The second scene is from a film called Proud Valley, with Paul Robeson. A black Pennsylvanian man starts work in a South Wales mine. The other miners are not too happy that he is black until they realise that they are also blackened. In my favourite scene a choir is singing at the eisteddfod, but the lead singer is not present. The conductor is about to sing the solo part when they hear Robeson singing outside and are spellbound. My final moment is from The Railway Children, when the children see their father again through the steam on the station platform. I am always terribly moved by that moment and so are my children.",

The ad put McQueen back on the streets of San Francisco, back on our television screens and, I suspect, Bullitt on this list. </p> <p>Rather than just pinching a scene and re-creating a pale pastiche, the makers shot new footage, spliced them together with the original film and hired Bullitt cinematographer William Fraker as a consultant to make sure we couldn't see the join.</p> <p>With visual references back to other McQueen films including The Great Escape and The Thomas Crown Affair - which also make this list - the ad is more a homage to the actor than a simple device to use him to sell cars, although there is no doubt that it also did that. But it is the exception. Advertising has stolen from film and not always treated it well. The Sound Of Music, The Great Escape, Ben Hur, Singing In The Rain, Casablanca, Star Wars, Ice Cold In Alex, Thelma And Louise, The Birds and numerous other films mentioned in this list have been lifted to sell everything from beer to cough sweets to cars. Especially cars where, because of either the epic nature of the sell or the fact that there are big budgets available, advertisers seem to find the movies irrestistible.</p> <p>'I quite liked the ad,' says Peter Yates who directed Bullitt back in 1968. 'My only complaint is that they didn't ask me to direct it. It was very well made and nicely exploited McQueen's intriguing persona. In principle I don't object to that sort of plagiarism when it's done well. But I've seen ads in the past using stars like Fred Astaire and John Wayne which were just terrible. It was really quite flattering.'</p> <p>For advertising agencies, the attraction is clear. If there is no creative idea for the ad, it is much simpler to re-create a scene with which people feel comfortable. It is immediate. There is no need to explain the meaning of certain iconic images. But most of it is cheap plagiarism. </p> <p>However, it is not just advertisers who pinch from film, but also other filmmakers. The red coat in Schindler's List looks remarkably like the red coat in Nicolas Roeg's 1973 Don't Look Now. The fact that the coat then cropped up in a 1997 Peugeot ad confirms the idea that a good image is never too old to be resuscitated. </p> <p>But it is a simple formula that doesn't always work. In the same year that Ford ran the Bullitt ad it also ran a campaign which it would rather forget. It was a skit on The Full Monty where a team of male strippers used a Ford Escort for getting to gigs. But the ad featured five white strippers and was immediately accused of racism for omitting the black character Horse. The ad was pulled.

Cinema directors, having persuaded their patrons to part with their money at the box office, can conduct themselves in a more teasingly sophisticated fashion. They can puzzle, disturb or even bore in the first scene, though only the commercially reckless would do that in the finale - Welles, for instance in Citizen Kane (though by 1979 this conclusion was so celebrated that Spielberg paid homage to it in Raiders Of The Lost Ark). In fact only six moments on the list occur in opening sequences - the D-Day assault in Private Ryan, the razored eye in Bu\u00f1uel's Un Chien Andalou (one of the few silent moments), Pip meeting Magwitch in Lean's Great Expectations, the vulnerable girl swimmer in Jaws, Woody Allen's constantly revised tributes to New York in Manhattan, David Niven's bomber pilot coming in on a wing and a prayer in A Matter Of Life And Death. However, 21 unforgettable moments - a fifth of the total - figure in final sequences, those images and lines of dialogue that are most vivid as you leave the cinema. Incidentally, is there any great movie that ends ineffectually or unmemorably? </p>",

TV directors must grab audiences at the outset, then hold them with dramatic hooks that precede every commercial. Cinema directors, having persuaded their patrons to part with their money at the box office, can conduct themselves in a more teasingly sophisticated fashion. They can puzzle, disturb or even bore in the first scene, though only the commercially reckless would do that in the finale - Welles, for instance in Citizen Kane (though by 1979 this conclusion was so celebrated that Spielberg paid homage to it in Raiders Of The Lost Ark). In fact only six moments on the list occur in opening sequences - the D-Day assault in Private Ryan, the razored eye in Bu\u00f1uel's Un Chien Andalou (one of the few silent moments), Pip meeting Magwitch in Lean's Great Expectations, the vulnerable girl swimmer in Jaws, Woody Allen's constantly revised tributes to New York in Manhattan, David Niven's bomber pilot coming in on a wing and a prayer in A Matter Of Life And Death. However, 21 unforgettable moments - a fifth of the total - figure in final sequences, those images and lines of dialogue that are most vivid as you leave the cinema. Incidentally, is there any great movie that ends ineffectually or unmemorably?",

      "body": "<p>We've all seen the pictures: it's an open and shut case isn't it? Here's big bad Roy Keane, with his bulging veins and invincible bank account, bullying poor little Andy D'Urso over the first league penalty to be awarded against Manchester United at Old Trafford in six years. </p> <p>Recognising that the two-minute hiatus in last weekend's victory over Middlesbrough looked unsavoury, Sir Alex Ferguson just about managed to apologise a couple of days later, although it is hard to imagine the United manager giving his captain the hairdryer treatment over an incident which showed just how well the pupil has learned his master's technique. There is not a manager in the league who does not want his players to perform with passion, and though Keane and Co might have overstepped the mark to give all the club's regular detractors a chance to air their prejudices and complain that Manchester United get away with murder, the fact remains that Ferguson's boys are the leading team in England, quite possibly in Europe, at playing each match as if their lives depended on it. </p> <p>Which is precisely why everybody hates them. Jealousy, pure and simple.

      "bodyText": "We've all seen the pictures: it's an open and shut case isn't it? Here's big bad Roy Keane, with his bulging veins and invincible bank account, bullying poor little Andy D'Urso over the first league penalty to be awarded against Manchester United at Old Trafford in six years. Recognising that the two-minute hiatus in last weekend's victory over Middlesbrough looked unsavoury, Sir Alex Ferguson just about managed to apologise a couple of days later, although it is hard to imagine the United manager giving his captain the hairdryer treatment over an incident which showed just how well the pupil has learned his master's technique. There is not a manager in the league who does not want his players to perform with passion, and though Keane and Co might have overstepped the mark to give all the club's regular detractors a chance to air their prejudices and complain that Manchester United get away with murder, the fact remains that Ferguson's boys are the leading team in England, quite possibly in Europe, at playing each match as if their lives depended on it. Which is precisely why everybody hates them. Jealousy, pure and simple. Apart from the staggering number of people on radio phone-ins expressing dissatisfaction with United's arrogance or Ferguson's one-eyed views, the most regular theme is the fan disenchanted with his own team. 'They just don't care,' is the common lament. 'They get paid more in a week than we earn in a year, and they are happy to collect their money whatever the result.'

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A confused old man remarks to another spectator: 'Do you know, that could be Ruud Gullit's brother.' </p> <p>'It is Ruud Gullit,' the spectator replies. </p> <p>'Are you kidding me?' demands the old man. </p> <p>'It's true. He plays for the AFC fifth team now.' </p> <p>The old man takes another look at the large, dreadlocked sweeper in the red shirt, and exclaims: 'He was in the Dutch team!' </p> <p>We are in a sports park just outside Amsterdam, two miles down the highway from the Ajax stadium, on a glorious, still, winter Saturday. In the canteen beside the ground old men play cards and ignore the football. OSDO third XI v AFC fifths has drawn 20 spectators, most of them the toddler offspring of the players, who have joined in the warming-up. </p> <p>They have caught Gullit on a bad day. Even as the Felliniesque figure performs his unmistakable broad-shouldered jog on to the muddy pitch, his team are falling apart. Before kick-off, the pygmy woman referee dispatches several AFCers to find shinpads. </p> <p>The AFC coach, a bad-tempered man with a mobile phone, confides that, because of holidays, he has had to call up reinforcements from lower teams. Granted, his sweeper is the European Footballer of the Year 1987, still only 37 years old and not given to Maradonaesque dietary excesses. But having Gullit in your park side is apparently a mixed blessing. </p> <p>'AFC 5 is not AFC 5 any more,' one player has told me. 'Now the boys are nervous in the changing room. No one dares to sit next to him.' </p> <p>The former manager of Chelsea and Newcastle, enjoying a 'rest' from professional football, made his AFC debut in September, soon after getting kicked out of St James's Park. A couple of his friends, fifth team regulars, got him to play in a friendly against ABN-Amro sixth XI, who had been threatening to field a ringer named Marco van Basten. </p> <p>That game kicked off with Gullit but without his former team-mate at Holland and Milan, who had fallen asleep on the sofa at home. However, woken by a phone call, Van Basten tore to the ground, where he was immediately brought on as a substitute. Eleven seconds later he had scored. He got another later, but Gullit's team won 6-2. </p> <p>Gullit also scored twice, enjoyed the game and decided to join AFC. He paid the membership fee of \u00a3120 a year; high by Dutch standards, because this is a chic club. Chelsea, the last team he played for, consented to the transfer. </p> <p>And so he became the sweeper of AFC fifths, much to the delight of a friend of mine who plays for AFC fourth team and had always known that he was a better player than Gullit. </p> <p>He could be right. Against OSDO, the AFC defence marshalled by Gullit concedes two goals in the first five minutes. Gullit, who for several games had maintained an uncharacteristic silence, has recently begun expressing his views. </p> <p>'Inside! Inside! Inside!' he tells one of his defenders. Then, sighing: 'I said inside.' One of his enduring themes is that his team-mates must learn to mark on the inside. </p> <p>It is to no avail. The AFC defence is what Johan Cruyff would call 'goats' cheese' and when an OSDO forward next sweeps into the penalty area, an exasperated Gullit stands aside and lets him score. </p> <p>'The cream has gone,' comments the confused old man. </p> <p>It would be wrong to say that Gullit is playing, as he would phrase it, 'like a turd'. Several times he sweeps a 50-yard pass on to his outside-left's left toe, an eerie sight in this setting. 'Good ball!' the AFC coach shouts reflexively. </p> <p>However, the winger can never control the ball. Several times Gullit overhits. If you had to guess which of today's players had 65 Dutch caps, you would probably pick one of the OSDO forwards. </p> <p>A spectator tells his son that Ruud Gullit is playing. 'Does he play for OSDO?' the boy asks. </p> <p>The father is shocked. 'Ruud Gullit, who played in Italy and for the Dutch team! You know him, don't you?' </p> <p>'Yeah, yeah, you're kidding me,' says the boy. </p> <p>Finally AFC get a cross into the box and Gullit, hurtling in, almost heads it into the top corner. Except that he misses the ball. The coach turns to me, beaming hugely, 'It almost makes you think of old times!' </p> <p>OSDO make it 4-0. By now AFC have begun the running commentary of mutual criticism traditional in a losing Dutch football team. </p> <p>'Goddammit! What was that?' shouts a forward. </p> <p>'Well do something up front!' suggests a defender. </p> <p>'Referee, that man always has his flag up!' says another forward. </p> <p>Gullit tries to be positive. He does not want to destroy anyone's confidence for life. After an AFC shot sails 20 yards over the bar, and some OSDO players joke about going home early, he laughs and shouts: 'They're getting tired!' </p> <p>Half-time comes with the score 5-0, and an OSDO striker walks up to shake Gullit's hand. 'I was thanking him for all the pleasure he's given me,' 40-year-old Thieu Heuijerjans reveals later. 'That man meant so much for Dutch football.' </p> <p>Heuijerjans and Gullit walk off arm in arm, chatting. Like Cruyff, Van Basten and Rinus Michels, Gullit has become a very nice guy by the simple expedient of retiring from top-class football. </p> <p>Walking back out for the second half, he throws a glance at the men playing cards in the canteen. They don't look back. They should have, though, because in the second half AFC are transformed. Is it creatine? In any case, the outside-right Alfons soon creates a goal with a brilliant solo run. </p> <p>'Alfie!' bellows Gullit. 'He is fit, he is sharp!' </p> <p>AFC win a penalty. Not Gullit, but Guido, the centre-forward, takes it. He scores. </p> <p>Then Guido makes it 5-3. Gradually, however, the AFC revival stalls. As the end approaches, the OSDO players' wives start singing the club song: </p> <p>'OSDO is our club, </p> <p>We have won!' </p> <p>Then, with only a minute to go, a cross from Guido reaches Ruud Gullit alone in front of an empty goal. This is his moment. But he is caught flat-footed. He tries to jump, cannot get off the ground, and as he contorts his body the ball sails over his head. Ruud Gullit has become a parks footballer. </p> <p>The pygmy ends the game, AFC have lost 5-3, and Ruud goes around shaking hands. He congratulates the pygmy at length, and to no one in particular he exclaims: 'The second half was better!' </p> <p>He pops into the canteen afterwards wearing a grey woollen Italianate coat: the Best Dressed Man in Britain 1996. He has a drink with his team-mates (not alcohol, never alcohol) and after five minutes says goodbye and is off in his people-carrier (the new thing among continental footballers, who are emerging from the Sports Car Age) which has what looks like a small boat strapped to the roof. From the canteen there is nary a backward glance. </p> <p>It is not that the Amsterdammers have forgotten Gullit, just that they don't go in for idols. This is a town where if you spotted Jesus Christ having a drink with Nelson Mandela at the next caf\u00e9 table it would be uncool to notice. Rembrandt was declared bankrupt here, Spinoza expelled from the synagogue, Cruyff nicknamed the Money Wolf, and when John Lennon and Yoko Ono left town after their bed-in for peace at the Hilton, they had to return their honorary white bicycles to the local hippies. So nobody mobs Gullit. An Amsterdammer himself, he says he likes that about the place. </p> <p>He could easily slip into former celebritydom. He is no longer even the most famous Ruud in Holland, having been outstripped by the brilliant young goalscorer Ruud van Nistelrooy (who should command the biggest transfer fee in Europe this summer) and Ruud, the character in the real-life soap opera Big Brother , who vomited on national television and coined the phrase , 'Come on! A nice cuddle.'</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The season stands at a turning point. In midweek, Manchester United moved ominously to the top of the Premiership; now it depends on whether rivals are intimidated or inspired by playing catch-up. The same might be said of referees officiating United games now - will they be intimidated or inspired? </p> <p>Watching five fearsome United players, vein-bulging faces contorted with arrogant, angry self-righteousness, surround the hapless referee Andy D'Urso after he had given Middlesbrough a penalty last week was indeed disturbing and distasteful. The very fact that even Sir Alex Ferguson condemned it means that it must have been. It might also have been counter-productive to their cause. </p> <p>For now United's conduct is in the spotlight, now a pattern of behaviour is out in the open. Referees and their assistants may more clearly discern what is happening on the field and be willing to address it, feeling that they will be backed by the right-minded majority outraged by the sight of Roy Keane and Co in Mr D'Urso's face. </p> <p>A prevaricating FA, who laughably oversaw a conference concerned with improving a ref's lot two days after the episode and came up with an eight-point plan but no action against United, may even have to respond to public sentiment and do the just thing. United themselves, to their detriment, may be forced to douse a fiery part of their game. </p> <p>Mr D'Urso said that he was forced to step backwards by the Old Trafford five because he felt he would be pushed over if he did not. From now on - and certainly if Paul Alcock is in charge of a United game - it can be assumed that referees will stand their ground and be in a position to check if David Beckham's roots need doing.

      "bodyText": "The season stands at a turning point. In midweek, Manchester United moved ominously to the top of the Premiership; now it depends on whether rivals are intimidated or inspired by playing catch-up. The same might be said of referees officiating United games now - will they be intimidated or inspired? Watching five fearsome United players, vein-bulging faces contorted with arrogant, angry self-righteousness, surround the hapless referee Andy D'Urso after he had given Middlesbrough a penalty last week was indeed disturbing and distasteful. The very fact that even Sir Alex Ferguson condemned it means that it must have been. It might also have been counter-productive to their cause. For now United's conduct is in the spotlight, now a pattern of behaviour is out in the open. Referees and their assistants may more clearly discern what is happening on the field and be willing to address it, feeling that they will be backed by the right-minded majority outraged by the sight of Roy Keane and Co in Mr D'Urso's face. A prevaricating FA, who laughably oversaw a conference concerned with improving a ref's lot two days after the episode and came up with an eight-point plan but no action against United, may even have to respond to public sentiment and do the just thing. United themselves, to their detriment, may be forced to douse a fiery part of their game. Mr D'Urso said that he was forced to step backwards by the Old Trafford five because he felt he would be pushed over if he did not. From now on - and certainly if Paul Alcock is in charge of a United game - it can be assumed that referees will stand their ground and be in a position to check if David Beckham's roots need doing. United had literally better back off if last week's episode is not to backfire on them. The tactic of a cluster of players surrounding a referee to try and influence him is by no means a new one in the professional game. The idea is that a referee is confronted by a group of faces and, not knowing which to book, cautions none of them. The Arsenal of George Graham were fond of that one.

This law states that it is inevitable that a returning player will score a goal. And so it was last week when Alan Shearer returned to Blackburn . </p> <p>Since his poor performances for England, especially against Scotland, fans have given Shearer plenty of stick. Bobby Robson even lost his marbles over it and told us that it was a disgrace to boo the England captain. Shearer has now answered all his critics in the only way he knows, by scoring goals. </p> <p>What was strange about Newcastle's FA Cup tie with Blackburn was that the home fans were still so nasty to Shearer. You would have thought that they would be grateful to him for his part, five years ago, in helping them to their first league title since 1914. He was popular with the fans and had turned down the chance to join bigger clubs than Blackburn when he left Southampton. </p> <p>Despite this all they did during the game was boo and taunt him. This clearly upset Shearer because for the first time in memory he changed his goal celebration. Instead of the more modest one-arm raised salute he did a Klinsmann and then pointed to the Blackburn fans with one hand while holding his Newcastle badge with the other. Fair enough we all thought, but Shearer didn't think it was. He has since apologised and admitted it was a stupid thing to do, and that he would never do it again. </p> <p>Blackburn fans don't seem to have the same sense of humour as the Geordies, who had a totally different reaction to one of their own ex-players, John Beresford, when he turned out against them recently for Southampton. He was cheered by the Newcastle fans when he came out to warm up but when he first touched the ball in play he was roundly booed and everyone laughed, including Beresford. </p> <p>I expect the Italians have lots of different rules to determine fans' reaction to 'ex' players. They will involve a whole number of factors. </p> <p>The most obvious reason to boo a returning player is that he has gone to play for your local rivals, which appears to be unforgivable. So when Pat Jennings first returned to White Hart Lane as an Arsenal player you might not have expected him to get a very warm reception. In fact he got a standing ovation. This was because other factors were involved, the main one being that he was forced out of the club: he was also a great goalkeeper and the fans liked him. </p> <p>Fans of the top teams hate it when a player goes to a rival big club so Sunderland fans will never forgive Michael Bridges for going to Leeds. They made their feelings very clear on his recent return to the Stadium of Light. Unfortunately for them La regola immutabile del ex came into play. </p> <p>The fans reserve their most venomous abuse for players who are deemed guilty of betrayal. Gazza was never given a welcome back by Newcastle fans because he left them for a flashy London team and then told the press how much better things were in the capital. But the biggest act of betrayal was that of Paul Ince. He is still hated by West Ham fans because he posed in a Manchester United shirt while still a West Ham player: an unforgivable sin. </p> <p>Age can be an important factor in fans' reaction to an ex. If a player has given the best days of his life to a club and leaves in his early thirties he will be treated well on his return. So Bryan Robson was more than welcomed on his return to Old Trafford with Middlesbrough. Supporters from a lower division side also don't object too much if a player with great talent goes to join the best team in the league. So when John Barnes left Watford for Liverpool the fans may have been upset but they never booed him on his return. Fans will also not boo an ex who has gone to play for an inferior team, so when Perry Groves returned to Highbury with Southampton the North Bank gave him a very warm reception. Indeed Perry, although useless, was a bit of a cult hero and cult heroes are always welcome back. </p> <p>No doubt the Blackburn fans who gave Shearer such a hard time last week will have their reasons for doing so. He has in their view broken one of the rules for a returning ex, though I'm not sure which one it is. It could simply be that they think he's a tosser. They would be better off displaying more of a sense of humour in their attempts to put Shearer off his game. They could take a leaf out of Chelsea fans' book; they always give Frank Sinclair a rousing reception on his return to Stamford Bridge and cheer his every move. And why not? He has scored nearly as many goals for Chelsea in a Leicester shirt as he did when he was at Stamford Bridge.</p>",

Given the present situation, the odds compilers will surely have to busy themselves with other matters until the leaves start changing hue. </p> <p>The reigning champions have become unbackable for the 1999-2000 title, not only because they established a nine-point advantage over their closest pursuers, Celtic, last Wednesday, but because they have exhibited such convincing form that a collapse is virtually impossible to envisage. </p> <p>Before the 4-0 whipping of Dundee United at Tannadice last midweek, Dick Advocaat and some of his players had expressed the potential difficulties presented by the month of February, during which they are scheduled to play four successive league games and one Tennents Scottish Cup tie away from home. </p> <p>It is the kind of programme that would cause managers of lesser teams to speculate that they would be satisfied at securing half the number of points available and a replay in the cup. That level of ambition is set several notches below that embraced by Advocaat and his side. </p> <p>The Dutchman is also perfectly entitled to expect maximum returns from these travels. During the past decade of dominance, Rangers - with the exception of 1998, when Celtic won the title - have demonstrated a characterful firmness of purpose in these 'trials' that has proved beyond all challengers. </p> <p>It is, indeed, the Ibrox side's ability to cope with away games that has proved decisive in jousts with their greatest rivals for the championship in recent seasons.

      "bodyText": "Betting on the outcome of the Scottish Premier League championship will be suspended until next August, or until Rangers have an accident that equates to falling down a manhole, whichever comes sooner. Given the present situation, the odds compilers will surely have to busy themselves with other matters until the leaves start changing hue. The reigning champions have become unbackable for the 1999-2000 title, not only because they established a nine-point advantage over their closest pursuers, Celtic, last Wednesday, but because they have exhibited such convincing form that a collapse is virtually impossible to envisage. Before the 4-0 whipping of Dundee United at Tannadice last midweek, Dick Advocaat and some of his players had expressed the potential difficulties presented by the month of February, during which they are scheduled to play four successive league games and one Tennents Scottish Cup tie away from home. It is the kind of programme that would cause managers of lesser teams to speculate that they would be satisfied at securing half the number of points available and a replay in the cup. That level of ambition is set several notches below that embraced by Advocaat and his side. The Dutchman is also perfectly entitled to expect maximum returns from these travels. During the past decade of dominance, Rangers - with the exception of 1998, when Celtic won the title - have demonstrated a characterful firmness of purpose in these 'trials' that has proved beyond all challengers. It is, indeed, the Ibrox side's ability to cope with away games that has proved decisive in jousts with their greatest rivals for the championship in recent seasons. The 'road' series they began so persuasively at Tannadice four days ago is unlikely to leave them numbed by apprehension. John Barnes, the Celtic manager, has been saying since the Old Firm match on 27 December ended 1-1 that his team now have to rely on others inflicting damage on the leaders, as even victory in each of the two remaining games against Rangers would not be sufficient to regain the championship as long as Advocaat's team won elsewhere.

If there is a squeak of a chance that they could drop points in this period, it is most likely to be found during their trip to Edinburgh. While Hibs have shown a destructive inferiority complex when playing the Old Firm in Glasgow, where they have been easily dismissed, Alex McLeish's team - promoted at the end of last season - have been altogether more difficult back at base. McLeish and his players still regard the 1-0 defeat by Rangers on 28 August as their unluckiest match of the season so far and their self-belief in tonight's renewal is likely to run much deeper than it does on sojourns to Ibrox. They have had a rewarding association with Sunday night matches televised by BSkyB, each of their three ventures having yielded victory. In the process, they have scored 10 goals and conceded five, suggesting that the supporters at the Rangers game are unlikely to wilt from boredom. Those previous triumphs in front of the numerous cameras deployed by the satellite broadcasters include a 3-0 thumping of neighbours Hearts, a 3-2 win over Dundee United and a 4-3 victory over Dundee. It is not difficult to imagine that McLeish and his men anticipate these occasions with some relish. 'We would all love to make Rangers and Celtic work a little harder in the Premier League,' said McLeish, 'and it is our aim to ensure that Rangers leave here realising they have been in a game.

      "body": "<p>As a Leicester fan I was forced to concede that, however cross Ian Ridley's article 'O'Neill's Blight on Wembley' (30 January) made me feel, much of it was based on essentially sound arguments. As a fan I have been gripped recently by my club's recent exploits and the drama of sudden-death finishes, but am the first to admit that the quality of football in several of the games has been far from entertaining for the fans. </p> <p>However, the arguments put forward were weakened by a consistent level of vitriol that ignored the basic facts. Leicester have produced some exceptionally entertaining games this season. The home games against Liverpool, Chelsea, Aston Villa and the away matches at Spurs, in particular, were full of open attractive football exhibiting the best features of the game. But the well-publicised injury crisis that has blighted Leicester over recent months has shorn them of, at times, their entire midfield creativity of Guppy, Izzet, and Lennon. Many sides like Leicester are plunged into crisis during these spells as they do not have the financial clout to afford the big names, nor the glamour status to attract these players without guaranteeing them first team football each week. </p> <p>This in itself does not wholly excuse an apparent lack of enthusiasm for playing good football. However, the simple truth, often ignored, is that when a side is facing opposition who man-for-man are of a higher ability than themselves, it often makes little difference whether an attacking or defensive formation is planned, they are invariably forced on to the back foot. </p> <p>Finally, it is worth noting that Leicester, even with their current unattractive football, by and large avoid the many other unattractive aspects of Premiership play that similarly undermine Premiership football, that is to say diving, shirt-pulling, requesting the referee to card opposition players, chasing the referee around the field, denying local talent the chance to progress through the ranks and pricing local fans out of the ground. Without clubs like Leicester we will surely have a Super League format made up of expensive stars from all over the world with no local or club passion, and the English game will have died. </p> <p> Steve Smith </p> <p>North Chingford, Essex </p> <p>In my imagination I can see the look of horror on Ian Ridley's face as he arrives at Stamford Bridge last Sunday, flicks through his programme and realises just quite what a catastrophic error he has made. It must surely be the journalist's worst nightmare; to see one's opinions on football echoed in print by Ken Bates. </p> <p>The fact that a journalist who seems to stop at Arsenal more often than the Piccadilly Line felt it appropriate to write the piece was unfortunate. Not nearly as unfortunate, however, as the absence of any sense of balance, impartiality or research. </p> <p>No one who supports Leicester City has always enjoyed the quality of some of the football we have produced in recent weeks, but we are certainly not embarrassed by it. On the contrary, most of us feel extreme pride at our ability to get results under exceptionally trying circumstances. While it might be easy to write a knocking piece lamenting the negativity and boredom of LCFC a little homework would have made a lot of difference. </p> <p> At the end of November Martin O'Neill won the manager of the month award. Leicester City were fifth in the Premiership and winning plaudits for their exciting attacking football. Journalists were talking of automatic qualification for Europe. Then the club suffered its worst injury crisis in 20 years. Would Manchester United have won the treble last year if they had been denied the services of Peter Schmiechel, Gary Neville, Dennis Irwin, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Roy Keane and Dwight Yorke for eight weeks? </p> <p>In a footballing world that appears to grow more cynical and homogenised each week, Leicester City stand out as a club which refuses toaccept the status quo. The fact that we survive - and win trophies - is not just good for us but good for every other team in English football. </p> <p>So next time you visit Filbert Street, Mr Ridley, I'd advise you to take your own refreshments. Humble pie might suffice, as you may find our cakes have been made with sour cream, especially for you. </p> <p> Ben Fletcher, </p> <p>London N22 </p> <p>It was a wind-up, wasn't it? If Ian Ridley spent less time tucking into Filbert Street's 'guilt-inducing' cream cakes and more trying to understand the difficulty of staying in the Premiership for clubs living on a shoestring (now that is worth debating) he would not be in the running for the Most Bollocks in One Piece Award. Leicester's patched-up tramp streamer may offend those who live in awe of the luxury liners in the same harbour, but for us loyal fans it looks lovely.Thank goodness Gordon Strachan knows what he is talking about. </p> <p> Chris Lymn, </p> <p>Leicester </p> <p>Leicester headed the Fair Play League last season, and despite the recent sending-off of Steve Walsh, still have an excellent disciplinary record under O'Neill. Give O'Neill and the Leicester players the credit they are due, as does Gordon Strachan in his perceptive piece. Strachan knows his subject; Ridley seems to be an expert on cream cakes. </p> <p> D. Thompson </p> <p>via email </p> <p>Here's a newsflash, Ian; success by any club outside the 'big six' is positively good for the game. I am a Manchester United fan and I have Arsenal fans telling me how it would be bad for the game if United win the Premiership this season - and they have a point. Not that I don't want to see my team succeed, but I don't begrudge 'smaller' clubs their achievements, even if they do come at the expense of open football. I don't expect to see teams try to take on the 'top' clubs at their own way of playing the game. I would like to nominate Martin O'Neill for Manager of the Year - his passion for the game is a tonic. </p> <p> Peter Murphy. </p> <p> via email </p> <p>Ian Ridley's article was not only insulting but also ignorant. Izzet, Guppy and Elliott, for example, have become far more capable and creative players since joining Leicester. Elliott has surely developed better footballing skills than most other central defenders in the Premiership (note his lovely goal against Chelsea at the weekend). Football as a whole, rather than the handful of super-rich clubs, is about making the most of what you have. May Leicester continue to shake elitist managers, chairmen and journalists and ensure football remains an unpredictable mix of both passion and skill. </p> <p> Peter Johnson, </p> <p>Bath </p> <p>Oh dear. What is one to make of Ian Ridley's spiteful criticism? Explanation 1: Apply conspiracy theory. All fans have a tendency to subscribe to this view that 'they' are against them. Explanation 2: Apply discourse analysis. Situation: Leicester are successful. Problem: They are not supposed to be. They have outgrown their plucky-losers position and are causing severe embarrassment to cash flows along the way. Solution: Hope they lose and patronise their supporters. Evaluation: The talent is sold, as it should be, and Filbert Street becomes a provincial pleasure garden once more. Explanation 3: Punishment: Use posi tion to denigrate in media. Crime: Beating Arsenal. </p> <p> Steve Issitt </p> <p>London WC1 </p> <p>Whoops! We've been found out at last. Ian Ridley has spotted that Leicester City pass the ball to Emile Heskey to wreak havoc in opposition defences, that we work hard to deprive the opposition of the ball, that we depend on Tony Cottee to do what he does best, snaffling the half-chance, and that we try to score from set pieces. Now this intrepid journalist has revealed the truth, we promise to do better. In future we will not pass the ball to a striker whose athleticism and power strike fear in to the hearts of defenders, and when the opposition have the ball, we will politely stand aside and let them play their pretty passing game. Above all, when we have a corner or a free-kick, we will not put the ball anywhere near the danger area, but immediately give away possession to the opposing team - particularly if they are from London, so that they are more easily able to demonstrate their superiority. Only a couple of things in Mr Ridley's article spoiled his demolition of Leicester City. First, that the food laid on for the benefit of him and other journalists is the best spread in the Premiership. Second, his strange notion that at Leicester the fans are 'civilised and fair-minded'. Can't comment on the cream-cake scenario, but civilised and fair-minded? I have never been so insulted! </p> <p> Paddy Casswell </p> <p>Markfield, Leicester </p> <p>Ian Ridley's feature was extremely interesting. Leicester City's style of football is just dreadful - watching them perform in the Worthington Cup first leg at Villa Park on 25 January was just like watching the Wimbledon of old. Hoof the ball up the pitch, shove your elbow into your opponent's face and that's that. </p> <p>Horrible, horrible, horrible! </p> <p>The only section of your feature that we disagree with is your description of the fans - 'civilised and fair-minded' they are not. They are arrogant, many of them are just yobs and they probably still bear a grudge against us for poaching a former manager of theirs - Brian Little, who resigned a very long time ago. And Robbie Savage seems to get glorified in every other newspaper you read - he's one of those players who disguises his footballing inability with cynical and dangerous tackles. </p> <p>But thanks for your feature - it was joy to read and it's about time that the country was told about this wolf in sheep's clothing. </p> <p>Michele Platman </p> <p>Birmingham</p>",

      "bodyText": "As a Leicester fan I was forced to concede that, however cross Ian Ridley's article 'O'Neill's Blight on Wembley' (30 January) made me feel, much of it was based on essentially sound arguments. As a fan I have been gripped recently by my club's recent exploits and the drama of sudden-death finishes, but am the first to admit that the quality of football in several of the games has been far from entertaining for the fans. However, the arguments put forward were weakened by a consistent level of vitriol that ignored the basic facts. Leicester have produced some exceptionally entertaining games this season. The home games against Liverpool, Chelsea, Aston Villa and the away matches at Spurs, in particular, were full of open attractive football exhibiting the best features of the game. But the well-publicised injury crisis that has blighted Leicester over recent months has shorn them of, at times, their entire midfield creativity of Guppy, Izzet, and Lennon. Many sides like Leicester are plunged into crisis during these spells as they do not have the financial clout to afford the big names, nor the glamour status to attract these players without guaranteeing them first team football each week. This in itself does not wholly excuse an apparent lack of enthusiasm for playing good football. However, the simple truth, often ignored, is that when a side is facing opposition who man-for-man are of a higher ability than themselves, it often makes little difference whether an attacking or defensive formation is planned, they are invariably forced on to the back foot. Finally, it is worth noting that Leicester, even with their current unattractive football, by and large avoid the many other unattractive aspects of Premiership play that similarly undermine Premiership football, that is to say diving, shirt-pulling, requesting the referee to card opposition players, chasing the referee around the field, denying local talent the chance to progress through the ranks and pricing local fans out of the ground. Without clubs like Leicester we will surely have a Super League format made up of expensive stars from all over the world with no local or club passion, and the English game will have died. Steve Smith North Chingford, Essex In my imagination I can see the look of horror on Ian Ridley's face as he arrives at Stamford Bridge last Sunday, flicks through his programme and realises just quite what a catastrophic error he has made. It must surely be the journalist's worst nightmare; to see one's opinions on football echoed in print by Ken Bates. The fact that a journalist who seems to stop at Arsenal more often than the Piccadilly Line felt it appropriate to write the piece was unfortunate. Not nearly as unfortunate, however, as the absence of any sense of balance, impartiality or research. No one who supports Leicester City has always enjoyed the quality of some of the football we have produced in recent weeks, but we are certainly not embarrassed by it. On the contrary, most of us feel extreme pride at our ability to get results under exceptionally trying circumstances. While it might be easy to write a knocking piece lamenting the negativity and boredom of LCFC a little homework would have made a lot of difference. At the end of November Martin O'Neill won the manager of the month award. Leicester City were fifth in the Premiership and winning plaudits for their exciting attacking football. Journalists were talking of automatic qualification for Europe. Then the club suffered its worst injury crisis in 20 years. Would Manchester United have won the treble last year if they had been denied the services of Peter Schmiechel, Gary Neville, Dennis Irwin, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Roy Keane and Dwight Yorke for eight weeks? In a footballing world that appears to grow more cynical and homogenised each week, Leicester City stand out as a club which refuses toaccept the status quo. The fact that we survive - and win trophies - is not just good for us but good for every other team in English football. So next time you visit Filbert Street, Mr Ridley, I'd advise you to take your own refreshments. Humble pie might suffice, as you may find our cakes have been made with sour cream, especially for you. Ben Fletcher, London N22 It was a wind-up, wasn't it? If Ian Ridley spent less time tucking into Filbert Street's 'guilt-inducing' cream cakes and more trying to understand the difficulty of staying in the Premiership for clubs living on a shoestring (now that is worth debating) he would not be in the running for the Most Bollocks in One Piece Award. Leicester's patched-up tramp streamer may offend those who live in awe of the luxury liners in the same harbour, but for us loyal fans it looks lovely.Thank goodness Gordon Strachan knows what he is talking about. Chris Lymn, Leicester Leicester headed the Fair Play League last season, and despite the recent sending-off of Steve Walsh, still have an excellent disciplinary record under O'Neill. Give O'Neill and the Leicester players the credit they are due, as does Gordon Strachan in his perceptive piece. Strachan knows his subject; Ridley seems to be an expert on cream cakes. D. Thompson via email Here's a newsflash, Ian; success by any club outside the 'big six' is positively good for the game. I am a Manchester United fan and I have Arsenal fans telling me how it would be bad for the game if United win the Premiership this season - and they have a point. Not that I don't want to see my team succeed, but I don't begrudge 'smaller' clubs their achievements, even if they do come at the expense of open football. I don't expect to see teams try to take on the 'top' clubs at their own way of playing the game. I would like to nominate Martin O'Neill for Manager of the Year - his passion for the game is a tonic. Peter Murphy. via email Ian Ridley's article was not only insulting but also ignorant. Izzet, Guppy and Elliott, for example, have become far more capable and creative players since joining Leicester. Elliott has surely developed better footballing skills than most other central defenders in the Premiership (note his lovely goal against Chelsea at the weekend). Football as a whole, rather than the handful of super-rich clubs, is about making the most of what you have. May Leicester continue to shake elitist managers, chairmen and journalists and ensure football remains an unpredictable mix of both passion and skill. Peter Johnson, Bath Oh dear. What is one to make of Ian Ridley's spiteful criticism? Explanation 1: Apply conspiracy theory. All fans have a tendency to subscribe to this view that 'they' are against them. Explanation 2: Apply discourse analysis. Situation: Leicester are successful. Problem: They are not supposed to be. They have outgrown their plucky-losers position and are causing severe embarrassment to cash flows along the way. Solution: Hope they lose and patronise their supporters. Evaluation: The talent is sold, as it should be, and Filbert Street becomes a provincial pleasure garden once more. Explanation 3: Punishment: Use posi tion to denigrate in media. Crime: Beating Arsenal. Steve Issitt London WC1 Whoops! We've been found out at last. Ian Ridley has spotted that Leicester City pass the ball to Emile Heskey to wreak havoc in opposition defences, that we work hard to deprive the opposition of the ball, that we depend on Tony Cottee to do what he does best, snaffling the half-chance, and that we try to score from set pieces. Now this intrepid journalist has revealed the truth, we promise to do better. In future we will not pass the ball to a striker whose athleticism and power strike fear in to the hearts of defenders, and when the opposition have the ball, we will politely stand aside and let them play their pretty passing game. Above all, when we have a corner or a free-kick, we will not put the ball anywhere near the danger area, but immediately give away possession to the opposing team - particularly if they are from London, so that they are more easily able to demonstrate their superiority. Only a couple of things in Mr Ridley's article spoiled his demolition of Leicester City. First, that the food laid on for the benefit of him and other journalists is the best spread in the Premiership. Second, his strange notion that at Leicester the fans are 'civilised and fair-minded'. Can't comment on the cream-cake scenario, but civilised and fair-minded? I have never been so insulted! Paddy Casswell Markfield, Leicester Ian Ridley's feature was extremely interesting. Leicester City's style of football is just dreadful - watching them perform in the Worthington Cup first leg at Villa Park on 25 January was just like watching the Wimbledon of old. Hoof the ball up the pitch, shove your elbow into your opponent's face and that's that. Horrible, horrible, horrible! The only section of your feature that we disagree with is your description of the fans - 'civilised and fair-minded' they are not. They are arrogant, many of them are just yobs and they probably still bear a grudge against us for poaching a former manager of theirs - Brian Little, who resigned a very long time ago. And Robbie Savage seems to get glorified in every other newspaper you read - he's one of those players who disguises his footballing inability with cynical and dangerous tackles. But thanks for your feature - it was joy to read and it's about time that the country was told about this wolf in sheep's clothing. Michele Platman Birmingham",

When backhanded complements turn into bitter criticism that's a different matter altogether. Martin O'Neill called Ian Ridley's article the most vitriolic attack on one team he has seen. Talk about twisting the knife. We were incredulous. We talked about it. We couldn't ignore it. It brought us closer together. </p> <p>We've come through a lot and the criticism only steels us even more. It all boiled over on Wednesday night in the Worthington Cup semi-final against Aston Villa. We knew it was make or break, our season hinging on that game, and the performance we put in with our best players back was very satisfying. That was us. That was what this squad of players is all about. </p> <p>There was a moment in the first half when Villa couldn't get the ball off us and the fans were singing 'Boring, boring Leicester'. The perfect response. </p> <p>I haven't seen us that fired up for a game for a long, long time.The dressing room beforehand burned with the desire to ram the taunts back down people's throats. It gives you inner strength and makes you feel invincible. </p> <p>There's not just great spirit here, there is ability too. That's why we feel such a sense of injustice. Apparently we represent ugly football. There are a few who aren't the best looking but I'll leave Robbie Savage out of it. We make no apologies for not always being good to watch because ultimately we are trying to win games. With the exception of Steve Guppy and Muzzy Izzet, Ridley actually described us as the 'preponderance of dross' which I find incredible. </p> <p>I'm the current Player of the Year in the Midlands which doesn't say a lot about the rest of the players in the Midlands when I'm described as the preponderance of dross. </p> <p>What seemed particularly unfair was launching these assaults when we had such a crippling injury list. At full strength we were sixth in the League and unbeaten at home. When we lost myself, Muzzy, Guppy, Tony Cottee, Andy Impey and Steve Walsh the heart of the team was ripped out. We were down to the bare bones, calling on players who hadn't had much first team experience or hadn't played much this season and they were fantastic. But if you lose quality players it's very hard to replace the qualities they bring. </p> <p>Take out half Manchester United's best players and obviously they will miss some class. Everyone wants to play champagne-style football but you can't always do it that way. Nobody wants Matt Elliott to play up front, least of all Matty, but with Cottee and Ian Marshall injured he is the next best option. If he is playing up front you have to hang it up for him to get knock downs for Emile. You can only play to your strengths. </p> <p>I don't find playing for Leicester boring at all. When I'm in the team I don't think we lump the ball. I certainly don't want to be tagged as a kick-and-rush player and I'm sure Muzzy, Guppy, Emile and Matt Elliott don't. </p> <p>Okay, sometimes it can be frustrating if you find yourself camped in your half and you have to defend. Mind you, it's funny how when we get players behind the ball we're playing for penalites yet when Arsenal do it it's called good defending. </p> <p>Ridley called us 'Wimbledon with fewer excuses'. What sort of line is that? We don't want to make an issue about how well we've done on a shoestring but sometimes we are competing against teams who have one player on the pitch who costs more than our whole team. We brought in Darren Eadie for \u00a33 million but we haven't spent much compared to other clubs. Getting crowds of under 20,000, in terms of the Premier League is on the low side. We are a provincial club. But we've beaten most of the Man Uniteds and Arsenals, and it's a credit to the players that a club of this size has reached three cup finals in four years. The Worthington Cup might be looked upon as the third trophy to go for but once we walk out at Wembley a lot of clubs will be very envious. </p> <p>The manager has been magnificent about the whole thing. I expect the attack on the team hurt him more than anything directed at him personally. He surprises me because he gets better all the time with each little crisis. I look at his team selections sometimes and think 'what is going on here?' Then the boys go out and produce something like beating Arsenal on penalites with two youth team players sitting on the bench. I hold him in the highest esteem. He has worked minor miracles with this club. </p> <p>We'd all love to have \u00a310m so he could bring in a bit more quality and push on but for now we do our best with what we have. On a limited budget he's bought well_ players high on ability and character. </p> <p>What we've got in terms of hunger, resolve, resilience and camaraderie is very special. We've a lot of players who came from the lower leagues and we are hungry. We're not spoilt here. We genuinely appreciate being in the Premiership.

      "bodyText": "People used to use words like 'plucky' and 'commitment' about Leicester and we found that patronising. When backhanded complements turn into bitter criticism that's a different matter altogether. Martin O'Neill called Ian Ridley's article the most vitriolic attack on one team he has seen. Talk about twisting the knife. We were incredulous. We talked about it. We couldn't ignore it. It brought us closer together. We've come through a lot and the criticism only steels us even more. It all boiled over on Wednesday night in the Worthington Cup semi-final against Aston Villa. We knew it was make or break, our season hinging on that game, and the performance we put in with our best players back was very satisfying. That was us. That was what this squad of players is all about. There was a moment in the first half when Villa couldn't get the ball off us and the fans were singing 'Boring, boring Leicester'. The perfect response. I haven't seen us that fired up for a game for a long, long time.The dressing room beforehand burned with the desire to ram the taunts back down people's throats. It gives you inner strength and makes you feel invincible. There's not just great spirit here, there is ability too. That's why we feel such a sense of injustice. Apparently we represent ugly football. There are a few who aren't the best looking but I'll leave Robbie Savage out of it. We make no apologies for not always being good to watch because ultimately we are trying to win games. With the exception of Steve Guppy and Muzzy Izzet, Ridley actually described us as the 'preponderance of dross' which I find incredible. I'm the current Player of the Year in the Midlands which doesn't say a lot about the rest of the players in the Midlands when I'm described as the preponderance of dross. What seemed particularly unfair was launching these assaults when we had such a crippling injury list. At full strength we were sixth in the League and unbeaten at home. When we lost myself, Muzzy, Guppy, Tony Cottee, Andy Impey and Steve Walsh the heart of the team was ripped out. We were down to the bare bones, calling on players who hadn't had much first team experience or hadn't played much this season and they were fantastic. But if you lose quality players it's very hard to replace the qualities they bring. Take out half Manchester United's best players and obviously they will miss some class. Everyone wants to play champagne-style football but you can't always do it that way. Nobody wants Matt Elliott to play up front, least of all Matty, but with Cottee and Ian Marshall injured he is the next best option. If he is playing up front you have to hang it up for him to get knock downs for Emile. You can only play to your strengths. I don't find playing for Leicester boring at all. When I'm in the team I don't think we lump the ball. I certainly don't want to be tagged as a kick-and-rush player and I'm sure Muzzy, Guppy, Emile and Matt Elliott don't. Okay, sometimes it can be frustrating if you find yourself camped in your half and you have to defend. Mind you, it's funny how when we get players behind the ball we're playing for penalites yet when Arsenal do it it's called good defending. Ridley called us 'Wimbledon with fewer excuses'. What sort of line is that? We don't want to make an issue about how well we've done on a shoestring but sometimes we are competing against teams who have one player on the pitch who costs more than our whole team. We brought in Darren Eadie for \u00a33 million but we haven't spent much compared to other clubs. Getting crowds of under 20,000, in terms of the Premier League is on the low side. We are a provincial club. But we've beaten most of the Man Uniteds and Arsenals, and it's a credit to the players that a club of this size has reached three cup finals in four years. The Worthington Cup might be looked upon as the third trophy to go for but once we walk out at Wembley a lot of clubs will be very envious. The manager has been magnificent about the whole thing. I expect the attack on the team hurt him more than anything directed at him personally. He surprises me because he gets better all the time with each little crisis. I look at his team selections sometimes and think 'what is going on here?' Then the boys go out and produce something like beating Arsenal on penalites with two youth team players sitting on the bench. I hold him in the highest esteem. He has worked minor miracles with this club. We'd all love to have \u00a310m so he could bring in a bit more quality and push on but for now we do our best with what we have. On a limited budget he's bought well_ players high on ability and character. What we've got in terms of hunger, resolve, resilience and camaraderie is very special. We've a lot of players who came from the lower leagues and we are hungry. We're not spoilt here. We genuinely appreciate being in the Premiership. I had five great years at Crewe but I was yearning for the big time and now that I'm here, I lap it up. I don't want to hear any more of this kick and rush nonsense. In fairness all teams want to be loved. But you only get that by what you do on a football pitch. I think we are loved and there's a healthy respect for us in the football fraternity. Looking down the fixture list everyone thinks Leicester are a dark horse and make for a tricky game. And I think we've earned that. Neil Lennon was talking to Amy Lawrence.",

'Africans don't keep records,' Ndumiso Gumede, secretary-general of the Zimbabwean FA, told me when I asked for a list of his country's caps, which only go back to independence in 1980. 'Ours is an oral history.' There are no records in his office, nor in other federation headquarters. Hassan, 33, first played for Egypt in 1985 as a teenager, picked by the former Wales manager Mike Smith for a 3-0 defeat in Norway. His hundredth cap went unnoticed in 1996 when he scored the last two goals in a 7-1 win over Namibia in the World Cup.",

In the summer of '98 it seemed as if every Tube station wall and every bus shelter had been taken over by the image of Gwyneth Paltrow holding up a referee's red card. </p> <p>The theory went that all men were glued to the World Cup, and, conversely, all women were football-haters who needed to take refuge in alternative reality comedy- dramas. Thus the ads insulted pretty much everybody. And, almost inevitably, the film was depressingly successful. </p> <p>You would have to be blindly dogmatic to deny that the cinema audience often splits down gender lines. Traditionally, women like fewer guns, fewer car crashes and more roles for actresses beyond token girlfriends, wives, secretaries, hookers or crones. But what is promising about this spring's batch of films tilted towards a female audience is that not one of them aspires to be this year's Pretty Woman . These are films directed by women (Holy Smoke, Boys Don't Cry, Mansfield Park), or co-adapted by women from books by women (Tumbleweeds and Girl, Interrupted). They are films in which actresses get to play tired, battered, drunk and even mentally ill women. There is a pleasing complexity to the characters. </p> <p>It would be nice to hail it as a breakthrough, but we have been here before. In the late Thirties and Forties the combination of writers such as Anita Loos and Dorothy Parker and sympathetic directors like George Cukor made for classics such as The Women. </p> <p>And in the late Seventies and early Eighties, modern feminism belatedly arrived in Hollywood, and the likes of Sissy Spacek, Jessica Lange and Meryl Streep were let loose in Coal Miner's Daughter, Frances and Sophie's Choice. But no matter how far things seem to have come at any given point, the anguished cries of actresses remain as loud. For every Kathy Bates able to make a living as a star/character actress, there are a dozen silicone-pumped 19-year-old blondes. </p> <p>But let's look on the bright side, and the obvious place to start is Boys Don't Cry, which could be the first film to earn someone the best actress Oscar for playing a swaggering stud. Kimberly Peirce's directorial debut is based on the bizarre life of Teena Brandon (aka Brandon Teena), a Midwestern teenager who not only felt she was a man, but managed to convince dozens of people - including his many girlfriends - that she was. </p> <p>Peirce takes this extraordinary piece of Jerry Springer-fodder and turns it into a grounded, plausible American tragedy. The little known Hilary Swank is fantastic as the doomed, cocky Romeo taking too many chances in impoverished smalltown America - and by most accounts is a rather more convincing male than Brandon really was. But the performance goes far beyond male impersonation, and Swank is well matched by the excellent Chlo\u00eb Sevigny as the girl who wanted to run with Brandon. Sevigny puts her New York It Girl tag far behind her: she's a substantial actress. </p> <p>The same desperate, drifting working-class-in-decline world is also the backdrop to Tumbleweeds, which has turned veteran British stage and TV actress Janet McTeer into a surprise film star. Part of the thrill for the US critics who raved about McTeer's performance seems to have come from the sheer distance between her status as a 'proper' British actress and her role as a white trash single mom. Based on model-turned-actress Angela Shelton's memoirs, Tumbleweeds is the story of Mary Jo Walker (McTeer) who drags her daughter round the country in flight from disastrous relationships. There's nothing too original about the plot, but McTeer is terrific. </p> <p>The other showboating, award-snagging performance coming our way is Angelina Jolie in Girl, Interrupted . Jolie has already picked up a supporting actress Golden Globe. This adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's account of her time in a psychiatric hospital film is Winona Ryder's long-nurtured pet project. Ryder is the executive producer and plays Kaysen, but Jolie hogs the movie as Kaysen's best friend, a liberating and destructive influence on all around her. At times she slips over the top, but there is a vivid glee in Jolie's performance. </p> <p> Girl, Interrupted is an actress's movie: the men are few and far between, and they only exist in relationship to the female characters. The tables are thoroughly turned on poor Jared Leto, who turns up as the pretty, ineffectual and soon out of the picture boyfriend. (Leto seems to be carving out a strange career as the sensitive male bimbo: in Fight Club his face was smashed to a pulp for being too good-looking). The cast of Girl, Interrupted ranges from Vanessa Redgrave and a restrained Whoopi Goldberg to the excellent young actresses Brittany Murphy (from Clueless) and Clea DuVall (from Faculty). For all the star-power on offer, Murphy and DuVall are the best things about the film. </p> <p>But if Girl, Interrupted is too obvious a bonding-in-misery flick, there are a couple of more eccentric films on offer. The first is Mansfield Park. That there would be an adaptation of Jane Austen's dourest novel was pretty inevitable: the Austen canon has been thoroughly plundered in recent times. But Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein's choice of director was Patricia Rozema, a typically off-beat Canadian best known for the sweetly meandering lesbian comedy I've Heard The Mermaids Singing . </p> <p>Rozema's Mansfield Park merges Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor) and Austen herself. Then she chucks in laudanum-addiction, a hint of lesbianism... and points out that the basis of elegant nineteenth century country life was the slave trade. Austen addicts have been up in arms, but alongside all the more chocolate boxy adaptations there is plenty of room for this reinterpretation. </p> <p> Mansfield Park looks very straight compared to Jane Campion's impressively odd Holy Smoke, which is worth cherishing if only for the scene in which Kate Winslet, driving through the outback, bellows along to Alanis Morissette. You'll never think of Winslet as a corset girl again. </p> <p>The most surprising performance by an actress this spring comes from the almost unrecognisable Cameron Diaz in Being John Malkovich, and her scenes with Catherine Keener are brilliant. And as for the unwittingly annoying Gwyneth Paltrow? Thoroughly outclassed by Cate Blanchett in The Talented Mr Ripley.</p>",

And as for the unwittingly annoying Gwyneth Paltrow? Thoroughly outclassed by Cate Blanchett in The Talented Mr Ripley.",

      "body": "<p>In 1961, Martin McGuinness failed the 11-plus, adding to a litany of deprivations that marked a childhood tailor-made for a future career as revolutionary/terrorist. His family was poor, his home overcrowded, his neighbourhood a marginalised, Catholic slum. His bronchial father's health was eroded even further by a lifetime's work in an iron foundry.</p> <p>In 1969, McGuinness witnessed his friends and neighbours batoned off the street by a brutish, sectarian police force. And then, the coup de grace, a man shot dead by British soldiers, his body brought to the end of McGuinness's street in sight of the 19-year-old butcher's assistant. The road McGuinness would choose began, perhaps, with the 11-plus failure. Instead of the high-achieving St Columb's College, he was 'selected' for the school next door, the Christian Brothers' technical school, long since demolished, but known at the time as the 'Brow o' the Hill'.</p> <p>A former St Columb's pupil, Dermot Byrne, recalled in a letter to The Guardian the awfulness of that neighbouring school: 'On days when the windows were open, we could hear the ranting and screaming of the teachers and the sound of punishment being administered.' A former St Eugene's classmate, Paul McGill wrote: 'When they [the Christian Brothers] weren't beating you, they were glorifying the historic struggles of the Irish against the English oppressors... It is interesting to speculate how differently life might have been if Martin had passed the 11-plus and gone to St Columb's, where, by the way, he might have been taught history by the leader of the SDLP.</p> <p>'As it was, he joined the IRA as many other disadvantaged young people did, in which he served for many years before embarking on the path of peace which led to his post as minister for education.' It's a tidy analysis and one that McGuinness rejects. Yes the Christian Brothers beat him, 'but they didn't make me a republican; the Brits made me a republican.' A former teacher at the school, Don O'Doherty, describes the teenage McGuinness: 'Martin was a very disciplined and industrious student and I never had any trouble with him. He was not outstanding in any way; however, he was extremely courteous and well-mannered.'</p> <p>McGuinness quit school at 15, moving through a series of low-paid, unskilled jobs. His first experience of sectarianism came when he was rejected for a job as a mechanic on the grounds of his religion. In 1971, then working as a butcher's assistant, 'events' began to utterly transform the quiet, obedient Bogside boy into a ruthlessly focused, lethally angry IRA activist. If his life up until then had lacked meaning, the republican struggle gave him an education and a direction that slum life in the Bogside never could. The deaths of Seamus Cusack and Desmond Beattie (shot by British soldiers in disputed circumstances on 8 July 1971) had the greatest impact.</p> <p>'I was at my front door and I heard roaring and shouting at the bottom of the street. It seemed that Dessie Beattie had brought in a car from the Leckey Road area. And I remember walking down to the bottom of the street seeing the body and the blood in the car and it scared the living daylights out of me. I was 19 years of age at the time and it had a powerful effect on me. I couldn't believe that anybody could be shot dead on the streets. For what? For throwing stones? I don't even know that Dessie Beattie was throwing stones'</p> <p>McGuinness then launched into what was probably his most intensive period of IRA activism. The Bogside became a no-go area for the security forces until Operation Motorman in 1972 moved to crush the no-go areas in Derry and Belfast. After that, McGuinness fled south to the Republic, evading capture until December 1972. McGuinness's early activism would become the foundation of his 'stellar' career within the republican movement. While others threw stones and petrol bombs, launched sniper attacks on British soldiers, planted bombs and sacrificed personal lives for the cause, he did it all to Olympic standards.</p> <p>During that period, the IRA in Derry launched a ferocious commercial bombing campaign. Just 20 of the city's 150 shops were finally left intact. 'It was a cleaner, less messy campaign than the one in Belfast,' said one Derry source. 'It was the IRA versus the Brits and there were no civilians killed during the campaign. There was almost something honourable about it. The campaign in Derry also avoided the purely sectarian hits that you had in Belfast. McGuinness also managed to keep republicans out of the clubs and the rackets.'</p> <p>The British army then became the primary target. Between August 1971 and December 1972, 26 British soldiers were killed by the Provisional IRA in Derry. Five were still in their teens, the youngest, Angus Stephen and William Raistrick, just 18-years-old. The majority were killed by IRA snipers. McGuinness has since acknowledged the working-class ties that could have bound the British squaddies and IRA men. But in those days, the soldiers' humanity was visible only in the brief paragraphs that marked their deaths and fleshed out their lives, the unborn children they would never get to see, the wives left weeping in English towns.</p> <p>By early 1972, the 21-year-old McGuinness had become an IRA superhero within the Bogside community. His personal bravery, his success is reviving the moribund Derry IRA into a strikingly effective force, his lack of affectation, all allied to an undeniable charisma, gave him an enduring iconographic status in the north's republican ghettos. 'He used to give us his bullet clips,' recalled Paul McGavigan, a former IRA activist in The Cook Report: 'He was a hero. You'd see him sniping, shooting around corners.' His reputation grew. Bogside women would goad the British soldiers: 'McGuinness will be out tonight. McGuinness will be out tonight...' He also induced fear among his own, alluded to in The Cook Report: 'You had to fear,' said one IRA activist, 'someone who had the power of life and death over you.'</p> <p>Musing about McGuinness's hold over the movement, Sean O'Callaghan wrote: 'McGuinness is a strict disciplinarian who possesses, nevertheless, a degree of integrity in his dealings with IRA volunteers. Almost universally respected within the movement, he is a hard militant with a proven track record of operational experience. A British Army officer who served in McGuinness's home town of Derry, once referred to him as, \"Excellent officer material\".' His first appearance at a press conference in April 1972 caused US TV producers to swoon. 'Jeez,' one such is reported to have said, 'that boy would be hot on the coast. Can you see him, 6ft tall, in a dinner jacket, raising funds.'</p> <p>'He had the looks,' recalled a Derry friend of McGuinness's. 'A lot of young girls used to find him gorgeous. A lot of them became republicans just because of him; they were like a fan club.' McGuinness's status did not go unnoticed. On 7 July 1972, he was part of a seven-man IRA delegation airlifted to London to meet with the then Northern Ireland Secretary of State, William Whitelaw. The talks came to nothing. In 1973 and 1974, McGuinness served two short prison terms for IRA membership. He has never faced charges in a British court. By the time the informer Sean O'Callaghan made his revelations, McGuinness was snug inside the peace process and no one was going to touch him.</p> <p>The one serious blow to his 'deadly but honourable' image was an interview in The Cook Report with 81-year-old Rose Hegarty, mother of Frank Hegarty, an alleged IRA informer, who was shot dead in 1986. Rose Hegarty told of how her son had returned from England after McGuinness had given repeated assurances of his safety to his mother. When Hegarty did return, Rose Hegarty claimed that McGuinness said he would have to attend a meeting across the Irish border, but that 'nothing would happen to Frank. McGuinness said he'd bring him home himself.' In her annual memorial notice to her son, Rose Hegarty alludes to an unnamed 'Judas goat'.</p> <p>McGuinness issued a blanket denial to every allegation in The Cook Report, yet he did support the murder of IRA informers. In a Panorama interview with Peter Taylor some time earlier, McGuinness said that if republican activists 'go over to the other side, then they more than anyone else are totally aware what the penalty for doing that is'. 'Death,' asked Taylor? 'Death, certainly,' McGuinness replied. On another occasion, speaking about the shooting dead of an alleged informer, a young woman, he said: 'To a republican soldier, she is a British agent... and she deserves to be executed.'</p> <p>He added that the IRA volunteer who had carried out her killing would have carried on with his day-to-day business 'without any [emotional] problem whatsoever'. From his prison release until his emergence under the Sinn Fein electoral umbrella in the early 1980s, McGuinness largely disappeared from media view. It is widely accepted that he was the IRA's Chief of Staff from 1978 until 1982, when he ceded the position to Kevin McKenna in the run up to the Assembly elections in which he secured a seat.</p> <p>The IRA killed 327 people during that period, which also witnessed three of the most high-profile IRA atrocities of the Troubles. On 17 February 1978, 12 people, seven of them women, were killed when an IRA firebomb devastated the La Mon Hotel on the outskirts of Belfast. On 27 August 1979, the Queen's cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, was killed by an IRA bomb on board a boat off the County Sligo coast. On the same day, 18 soldiers were killed when the IRA exploded two 800lb bombs at the Warrenpoint army base. If McGuinness was, as is widely believed, Chief of Staff at the time, it is clear that his reputation was further bolstered within the movement by the latter two 'spectaculars'.</p> <p>Shortly after his 1974 release, he married Bernadette Canning, in a private church ceremony in Donegal. Vast sums of money were offered for photographs of the occasion, but no one obliged. The couple's first child was born in 1976, and the family was complete by 1986. That year the McGuinness family appeared in the BBC's Real Lives documentary, 'At the Edge of the Union', a programme promptly banned by the British government. The portrayal of McGuinness as a deeply committed, and loving father and husband, was more than Margaret Thatcher could stomach. Pure evil is a hard concept to push when the evil one is bouncing a fat, dribbling baby on his knee. In one scene, McGuinness walks on a Donegal beach with his wife and children; in another he is at the kitchen table coaxing alternate spoonfuls of what looks like shepherd's pie into his then baby son Emmet and the next in line, Fiachra.</p> <p>Yet from a distance of more than 14 years, it is McGuinness's irresolute support of the IRA that comes across most strongly. It is inconceivable that McGuinness would now allow himself to be filmed in the centre of a republican mob chanting, 'Up the Ra, Up the Ra, Up the Ra', or to stand, ramrod stiff in front of a camera and state that it would be the armed campaign of the IRA that would eventually get the Brits out.</p> <p>'We don't believe,' he said, 'that winning elections and any amount of votes will bring freedom in Ireland. At the end of the day, it will be the cutting edge of the IRA that will bring freedom.' Fourteen years later, in the Union Hall in Manhattan, McGuinness would ask his audience to: 'Help us become the largest political party in the north and south.' Sinn Fein and the IRA's evolution from the mid-1980's is well charted. By 1990, McGuinness was leading secret talks with the British government.</p> <p>While history will sort out who cajoled whom to do what, it is clear that the decision to allow the ballot box to override the Armalite was a tactical one and not the conversion of a middle-aged IRA grandfather who likes Bran Flakes, and fly-fishing and Ali G, to the virtues of pacifism.</p> <p>'The IRA stopped,' says McGuinness, 'because people put a political analysis to them which in their judgement was a project worthy of support.' On a late Friday afternoon, McGuinness takes me through Stormont Castle. He's in his shirtsleeves, utterly cool, walking through the corridors with an ease that belies that this man fought for almost three decades to raze this structure to the ground - if only metaphorically.</p> <p>When visitors gape, he doesn't even notice. When an usher shuffles to attention as he passes, he beams and shakes his hand. Downstairs in the canteen, he eats battered fish and boiled potatoes, politely asking if I'd like a 'cappuccino'. An attendant lifts a tasselled rope to allow us to enter the Assembly chamber. 'That's where I sit and that's where Big Ian [Paisley] sits,' he says. 'He has an office just down from us, you know. I always say hello when I pass. It drives him mad. There was one time I went into the loo and he was standing outside in the corridor with someone. When I came out he was on his own. I think he wanted to say something, but he just couldn't bring himself to do it.'</p> <p>Upstairs, in the green wing, the Sinn Fein office is awash with parliamentary detritus - New Year calendars and commercial diaries, picked over by staff and Assembly members . There is no sense that they are there for a fleeting visit. If the Executive does collapse, the premises will be vacated - temporarily. I ask McGuinness if the IRA will continue to exist if the decommissioning issue is solved and the political institutions continue to operate.</p> <p>'That's a matter for the IRA. The Old IRA existed in the south for years. They attended commemorations, they buried their own comrades, and they did so peacefully. It's an odd question in my opinion. Why should we worry about it?</p> <p>'Will decommissioning happen? That's for De Chastelain and the IRA. My opinion? My opinion is that I have to make politics work. As far as I'm concerned, I am one of those people who believes that if politicians make politics work, and we press on to implement the agreement, then the armed groups are out there and they're going to have to look at that and they're going to have to decide for themselves what contributions they want or do not want to make. I'll try to make it happen in the best way I can. 'But the unionist approach to the decommissioning issue hangs like a sword of Damocles over the executive and, therefore, over the whole agreement.' He escorts me to the door, checking that my taxi is there before he turns and saunters back up the Castle steps. Utterly disarming Martin.</p>",

For his role in Milos Forman's Man On The Moon, he beat off some serious opposition to play the part of doomed, demented stand-up comic Andy Kaufman. </p> <p>Hollywood gossip says the director was swamped with audition tapes from the very best actors available and was so overwhelmed by the choice that he left it to the studio to decide. </p> <p>The film's release was bumped to the all-important end-of-year slot to keep it fresh in the Academy's mind when the voting slips went out. But when it was finally released in the States, the public failed to react. Even though The Truman Show had breezed past the $100 million mark - and despite almost a year of hype that suggested Man On The Moon was Carrey's best work to date - it opened on Boxing Day to a surprisingly subdued take of a little over $7m. Carrey went on to take a Golden Globe for his perfor mance and stands a very good chance of making the Oscar short list, but the paying public's lack of affection for this remarkably honest and moving biopic was conveniently brushed under the carpet. </p> <p>The truth is that Andy Kaufman, respected and revered as he was by his peers, was not terribly popular with the rest of America. After peaking as the endearingly bumbling foreigner Latka in the hit sitcom Taxi, he set about destroying his new-found fame with a series of mind-bending pranks and jokes that the public never really got. </p> <p>Abandoning traditional comedy altogether, Kaufman pioneered a strain of surrealism that tested people's patience. When he 'forgot' his lines, was he joking? When he stood up onstage and read The Great Gatsby for three hours, was he joking? When he insulted women and invited them to wrestle him, was he joking? And when he died of cancer, at the age of 35, was he still joking? </p> <p>The public's threshold for surrealism has never been strong. Although he made his name with the surrealist classics Un Chien Andalou and L'Age D'Or , Luis Bu\u00f1uel went without work for most of the Thirties and arrived penniless in New York at the end of the decade. In the 60 years since, surrealism has largely been the province of the art movie, and even though certain figures (David Lynch, Terry Gilliam and David Cronenberg especially) are able to entice some of America's most respected actors off the beaten track, the box office figures tell their own story. </p> <p>A case in point is last year's Fight Club, which peaked at $36m despite a wealth of hype and the presence of pretty boy Brad Pitt. The violence turned off his female fanbase, and many more were baffled by the film's ambiguous setting and far-fetched plot twists. Similarly, Martin Scorsese's visually stunning Bringing Out The Dead died a premature death of its own, with many bemoaning its seemingly pointless scenes of pyrotechnic excess without realising that this sensory pile-up was part of the film's point. </p> <p>The treatment of these films would suggest public indifference to movies that bend reality - if it weren't for a couple of films that have sneaked under the wire lately. The first is American Beauty, which managed to capture the public's imagination even though its lead character is quickly established as telling his story from beyond the grave. The film is also punctuated by beautiful, wordless scenes of aesthetic indulgence that are there only because of the raw connections they spark. The film's success, plus the early reception afforded Paul Thomas Anderson's decidedly offbeat Magnolia seems to suggest the American public are a little more open to surrealist interludes when they find their place within a standard narrative. (A different kind of weird - also within a fairly straightforward narrative - is the very idea of Mike Leigh, whose films tend to scrutinise present-day Britain, moving onto a biopic of Gilbert and Sullivan!) </p> <p> But this doesn't explain the incredible appeal of Being John Malkovich, a seemingly ridiculous outsider by promo director Spike Jonze that squeezed into Variety 's Top 100 of 1999 with a year-end take of $18m, just 14 places below the much-vaunted and ostensibly much more commercial Man On The Moon at $24m. </p> <p> Man On The Moon, after all, is about a man the American public once took to their hearts and it features one of their favourite stars. Being John Malkovich, in contrast, stars John Cusack as a failed puppeteer who gets a job as a filing clerk on the seven-and-a-halfth floor of a major New York building. By accident he drops an important document behind the back of a filing cabinet and, on retrieving it, uncovers a portal that leads directly into John Malkovich's brain. And then he starts selling tickets. </p> <p>Bearing in mind that David Cronenberg's eXistenZ, an entertaining but pretentious take on computer games in the new millennium, took less than $3m, the success of Being John Malkovich is no small achievement. Yet the makers themselves are not convinced that the public is necessarily warming to the genre, seeing it as more a case of people being bludgeoned into submission by the film's lack of compromise. 'Maybe it's because it's so relentlessly that way,' says writer Charlie Kaufman of his film's success. For Kaufman, the superficial strangeness of the story masks an oddly human love triangle that makes up the strange emotional core of the film: the puppeteer, his forlorn wife and the dazzling female workmate who comes between them. </p> <p>'The reality is in the characters' reaction to their circumstances, and also to what it is they're desperate about,' he says. 'I was interested in that as a way of grounding it, so it wasn't just being weird for weird's sake.' </p> <p>The film may yet signal something of a watershed in American cinema history, and already Patricia Arquette has signed up for a role in Kaufman's follow-up, Human Nature, in which she'll play the world's hairiest lady. He also has another script being made, adapted from a non-fiction book, which seems to astonish even him. It's about orchids, the natural history of orchids, and orchid collectors. There's a character who steals an orchid from a Florida swamp, but he disappears halfway through. There is, Kaufman says quite freely, no story. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the forthcoming adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho -in which Manhattan yuppie Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) may or may not be a hideous misogynist serial killer - looks set to take Fight Club 's mindgames into a controversial new dimension. But anyone expecting a new surrealist revolution to happen overnight may be in for a long wait. In November a letter appeared in the New York Times complaining about a scene in Kaufman's film in which John Cusack's puppeteer locks his wife in her pet monkey's cage so he can enter John Malkovich's body and make love to another woman. The writer claimed that, in terms of feminism, this was not a progressive movie. Says Kaufman - and he should know -'It's bizarre.'</p>",

Matsukevich was 18 at the time and is now on the British cancer register as a result of ovarian and thyroid cysts caused by radiation from the plant. She lives in West Quantoxhead, 10 miles from Hinkley Point, and fears a similar accident here if BNFL reopens the reactors. 'It's a sad irony for me,' she told The Observer , 'I know too well what's it's like when an accident happens and it's terrible. I am always conscious of the presence of Hinkley Point and I am scared to take my daughter to the beach.' A spokeswoman for the Environment Agency said the report on the consultation over the Magnox stations would be published at the end of the year after a series of public meetings. She added that global warming was a serious issue and the agency had allowed for a six-millimetre annual rise in sea levels in its plans for sea defences. Colin Bennett, of BNFL Magnox Generation, said no special preparation had been made to protect decommissioned reactors from flooding and added that sea water was already used in the cooling process. 'In the highly unlikely event that water got into a plant,' he said, 'the sea water itself would be an economic loss, but there would be no major safety issues.' martin.bright@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Our meeting is scheduled for 4 o'clock, but Lord Snowdon's assistant rings me late morning, asking if it would be possible for us to meet for lunch instead. Actually, it's not at all convenient, so I lodge some objections, but then - after a little muffled conferring - she says Snowdon would like a word. 'I was thinking,' says an elderly voice, mildly but firmly, 'that it might be fun to talk over lunch, wouldn't it?' and of course, after that, there is no point in arguing.</p> <p>An hour or so later, we are making our way to the restaurant closest to his Kensington house. As we walk - very slowly, for he's a few weeks short of his seventieth birthday, and has had a limp since a teenage brush with polio, and in any case his manners are so painfully exquisite that he pulls back whenever we approach lampposts so that I can go on ahead - we see a crocodile of smart little London schoolgirls approaching, a battalion of Emilys and Jessicas in blue and grey blazers, paired off like Noah's cargo. When they've passed, Snowdon turns to me and asks, 'Do you think they might all be related?'</p> <p>Beneath all the whimsical twinkling, Snowdon is a man of secrets: his appetite for the frivolous is entirely compatible with his cast-iron discretion when it comes to more serious matters. As a result, he has never talked about his first wife, Princess Margaret, or the suicide of a long-term mistress four years ago, or the recent separation from his second wife, Lucy, or the affair which resulted in the birth of a son called Jasper in 1998 (all the things, in other words, that anyone might want to ask him about); yet even when he's deflecting a parry into his personal life, he does so with immense amiability. Consequently, he is a nightmarish interview subject. When he's not being vague or forgetful, he's being evasive. Yet somehow, his charm renders him untouchable: the Teflon toff.</p> <p>Having shed his Margaret Howell overcoat and a duck-egg scarf - a relic of Cambridge days, half a century ago - Snowdon is shown to his customary table ('I like to see who's coming around the corner') and sits down to consider the menu, juggling two sets of spectacles. His remarks to the waiter are characteristic: half-apologetic, in the way of the well-mannered top-drawer set, and half-bracing.</p> <p>He orders duck liver, followed by roast chicken, although the description of the gravy appears to irritate him slightly: 'What's the tarragon \"jus\"?' he asks, with a little bit of an edge. Though Snowdon accepted the life peerage offered to him in the new-look House of Lords, whereas the Duke of Edinburgh and his sons all refused theirs, he says he is not one for fancy titles. Talking about his forthcoming show at the National Portrait Gallery, he says, 'I hate the word \"portraits\". Portraits to me means something that is rather grand and old-fashioned, in oils. It's better to say photographs.' Then he adds, 'Hate the word \"retrospective\", too. It's a bit pompous. I didn't want it to be called a retrospective, but they wanted to, so I said, \"Well, call it an obituary then.\" ' He snuffles a bit.</p> <p>The NPG exhibition probably says more about Snowdon than he ever will. In it, you can see traces of his society background, his interest in the arts, his royal connections, as well as his social conscience (he is reported to be staying on in the Lords to continue his campaigning work for the disabled).</p> <p>Perhaps it's modesty, or that posh trait of pretending not to take anything seriously, but he is relentlessly offhand about photography. 'When I started out, you only took photographs because you drew badly. It was a very lowly profession,' he says, and, 'It has all got too grand. It's pretty rubbish, they should just get on with it. We're reporters.'</p> <p>He can't resist asking whether I've seen a particular feature in a recent Tatler, a Mario Testino promotion for a mackintosh manufacturer, masquerading as the wedding album of Kate Moss and Lord Frederick Windsor. 'Have you seen those latest things, taken by Mario, which are very bizarre? No, I couldn't possibly comment on Mario's work... I am very fond of him, I know him a little bit.' His daughter from his second marriage, Frances, now in her early twenties, worked with Testino before moving on to be one of Paolo Roversi's assistants.</p> <p>Like the Great Wall of China seen from space, a Testino fashion spread is utterly distinctive, whereas Snowdon's work - like the earl himself - is altogether more difficult to pin down. When I ask him to describe its hallmarks, he looks horrified. 'I hope nothing,' he says, spooning bread sauce on to his plate. 'If I have a recognisable style, that's my failing. It would just mean that I'm repeating myself. I just want to capture something that relates to the [subject].' Later, he backtracks on this as well, as if it was too ambitious (I can't help feeling that his words have a bearing on our meeting, too). 'It's not always trying to get to the truth, it's trying to amuse as well. A lot of the time I'm playing games, and a lot of it's theatre, and a lot of it's cheating, in every possible way.'</p> <p>So which line to take on Snowdon? Some facts, at least, are unarguable. He was born in 1930, to a barrister and an heiress who divorced when he was five. He and his elder sister Susan spent their childhood at their father's estate in Caernarvonshire and with their mother - who swiftly remarried the Earl of Rosse - in Ireland and Yorkshire. He was sent to Eton and then, excused National Service because of the polio, studied architecture at Cambridge. He left without a degree but with a blue, having coxed the victorious side in the 1950 Boat Race.</p> <p>By then, he'd already begun to be interested in photography - or more accurately in cameras. (He's fascinated by mechanics. 'I walk around like a ferret,' he says, explaining how, on a recent visit to Paris, he was so transfixed by a water sculpture on the Champs Elys\u00e9es that he laboriously tracked down its bewildered Greek creator. They had lunch together a few weeks ago. 'My Greek's not very good, and really it was so complicated, but I adored him because he was absolutely obsessed by his fountain. It drove me absolutely mad until I found out how it worked.')</p> <p>At school, he'd founded a photographic society, 'mainly because I wanted to go somewhere quiet', and invented an underwater camera: 'You had to surface every time you wound it on, so it only took one picture at a time. That's quite good training.' After Cambridge, his father paid for him to study at Baron's photographic studio, and then helped him rent his own in Pimlico. You might think this showed extreme tolerance, but the family had bohemian connections: a great-uncle was a Punch cartoonist, and Anne's brother, Oliver Messel, was a celebrated set-designer.</p> <p>During the Fifties, young Armstrong-Jones successfully reconciled the roles of snapper and debs' delight (he was a very popular walker) and won his first royal commission, taking the 21st birthday photographs of the Duke of Kent. In 1958, he met Princess Margaret and, in order to muffle the relationship as much as possible, rented an apartment in darkest Rotherhithe, where they ate fish and chips straight from the wrapper.</p> <p>They had two children and divorced in 1978. There's little doubt that Snowdon's career was partly inhibited by the match; after all, he was now as famous as anyone he was commissioned to photograph. So he returned to design: an electric wheelchair, and a collaboration with an architect and an engineer which led to the the aviary ('that funny old birdcage') at London Zoo, for which he was paid \u00a3145, 'and that included the model'.</p> <p>Snowdon has finished his glass of white wine, so I offer him another.</p> <p>'No darling, let's have a red wine. A bottle. Can they afford it?'</p> <p>The matre d' is there in the blink of an eye. 'The house claret? Or would you prefer something fuller-bodied?'</p> <p>'Ah, I wonder. No, no. I think that ordinary one.'</p> <p>The matre d' starts to ask whether I'd like another glass of white, but Snowdon is too quick. 'No, we'll have a bottle of the red, I think.'</p> <p>'You'll have a bottle of it?' repeats the matre d', with emphatic neutrality.</p> <p>'Well, don't sound so surprised,' says Snowdon, rather crossly.</p> <p>'No, that's fine, it's just that you usually drink it by the glass, sir.'</p> <p>Snowdon subsides, like a balloon that has been left too close to the radiator. 'Oh, alright. We'll try it by the glass.'</p> <p>'I'm happy to do whatever you prefer, sir,' the waiter offers, but Snowdon has given up. 'We'd better have it by the glass,' he repeats dispiritedly. When we're about to leave, he notices I haven't finished mine - 'Might drink that. Are you going to leave it?' - and polishes it off.</p> <p>After lunch, we walk back up the street to the house where he has lived since his first marriage ended, and where he now lives alone, surrounded by clocks, and mechanical toys, and a clutch of elegant scarlet chairs which he designed for the Prince of Wales's investiture at Caernarvon in 1969.</p> <p>Of course, I'd like to ask why he hasn't yet divorced from his second wife, Lucy; and whether he ever sees his son, Jasper, the result of a brief affair with a commissioning editor at Country Life which preceded the separation; and what went on with poor Anne Hills, who took an overdose on New Year's Eve 1996 after a 20-year on-off relationship with the earl; but instead, Snowdon is telling me about a trip to the cinema with Frances last week to see the new Scorsese film, which was awful, and about how he has converted her Paris bathroom into a darkroom, and how he's forever nipping over on Eurostar with his toolbox, and how he wishes the train would just shoot off the end of Brighton Pier with a great splash instead of slinking underground.</p> <p>This prompts another thought entirely, which leads to another, and to another: 'It's wonderful when you go to Moscow or St Petersburg - there are no railings in the parks or squares. It's all open, everyone can walk in. Why do we have to have these awful prissy little keys to go into a park? We should pull all the railings down. Get rid of them, open it all up, green grass, and make everyone welcome. It would be wonderful. It was like that during the war when all the railings were melted down. Unfortunately, they melted them up again. Why do you say \"melt down\" but not \"melt up\"? I was thinking about this the other day. You don't say, \"It's trying not to rain,\" do you? But you'd say, \"It's trying to rain.\" All these weather forecast things I love to listen to before I go to sleep. Don't you? The latest news from Fred Astaire and Rockall... We were going to do a film, John Betjeman and I. It was called Cloudy Bright, which used to be printed on packets of photographic film, I don't think it is any more. A lovely title, don't you think? Peter Sellers was going to be in it, and we had one meeting at the RAC Club in Pall Mall, for lunch, and we were stopped at the door because Peter didn't have a tie on, so he put one on, but inside the collar... those kind of rules drive me so mad. I remember once not being allowed into the dining room of the Mandarin hotel in Hong Kong because I wasn't wearing a tie, so I went out and bought a Mao jacket, and put it on, and they had to allow me in then because I was in the national costume.'</p> <p>All this means that I leave bamboozled and entirely empty-handed. A day or so later, a note arrives, thanking me for lunch. At the end, he has written, 'I only hope you got what you wanted.' I can hear his snuffle from here.</p>",

'It's not always trying to get to the truth, it's trying to amuse as well. A lot of the time I'm playing games, and a lot of it's theatre, and a lot of it's cheating, in every possible way.' So which line to take on Snowdon? Some facts, at least, are unarguable. He was born in 1930, to a barrister and an heiress who divorced when he was five. He and his elder sister Susan spent their childhood at their father's estate in Caernarvonshire and with their mother - who swiftly remarried the Earl of Rosse - in Ireland and Yorkshire. He was sent to Eton and then, excused National Service because of the polio, studied architecture at Cambridge. He left without a degree but with a blue, having coxed the victorious side in the 1950 Boat Race. By then, he'd already begun to be interested in photography - or more accurately in cameras. (He's fascinated by mechanics. 'I walk around like a ferret,' he says, explaining how, on a recent visit to Paris, he was so transfixed by a water sculpture on the Champs Elys\u00e9es that he laboriously tracked down its bewildered Greek creator. They had lunch together a few weeks ago. 'My Greek's not very good, and really it was so complicated, but I adored him because he was absolutely obsessed by his fountain. It drove me absolutely mad until I found out how it worked.') At school, he'd founded a photographic society, 'mainly because I wanted to go somewhere quiet', and invented an underwater camera: 'You had to surface every time you wound it on, so it only took one picture at a time. That's quite good training.' After Cambridge, his father paid for him to study at Baron's photographic studio, and then helped him rent his own in Pimlico. You might think this showed extreme tolerance, but the family had bohemian connections: a great-uncle was a Punch cartoonist, and Anne's brother, Oliver Messel, was a celebrated set-designer. During the Fifties, young Armstrong-Jones successfully reconciled the roles of snapper and debs' delight (he was a very popular walker) and won his first royal commission, taking the 21st birthday photographs of the Duke of Kent. In 1958, he met Princess Margaret and, in order to muffle the relationship as much as possible, rented an apartment in darkest Rotherhithe, where they ate fish and chips straight from the wrapper. They had two children and divorced in 1978. There's little doubt that Snowdon's career was partly inhibited by the match; after all, he was now as famous as anyone he was commissioned to photograph. So he returned to design: an electric wheelchair, and a collaboration with an architect and an engineer which led to the the aviary ('that funny old birdcage') at London Zoo, for which he was paid \u00a3145, 'and that included the model'. Snowdon has finished his glass of white wine, so I offer him another. 'No darling, let's have a red wine. A bottle. Can they afford it?' The matre d' is there in the blink of an eye. 'The house claret? Or would you prefer something fuller-bodied?' 'Ah, I wonder. No, no. I think that ordinary one.' The matre d' starts to ask whether I'd like another glass of white, but Snowdon is too quick. 'No, we'll have a bottle of the red, I think.' 'You'll have a bottle of it?' repeats the matre d', with emphatic neutrality. 'Well, don't sound so surprised,' says Snowdon, rather crossly. 'No, that's fine, it's just that you usually drink it by the glass, sir.' Snowdon subsides, like a balloon that has been left too close to the radiator. 'Oh, alright. We'll try it by the glass.' 'I'm happy to do whatever you prefer, sir,' the waiter offers, but Snowdon has given up. 'We'd better have it by the glass,' he repeats dispiritedly. When we're about to leave, he notices I haven't finished mine - 'Might drink that. Are you going to leave it?' - and polishes it off. After lunch, we walk back up the street to the house where he has lived since his first marriage ended, and where he now lives alone, surrounded by clocks, and mechanical toys, and a clutch of elegant scarlet chairs which he designed for the Prince of Wales's investiture at Caernarvon in 1969. Of course, I'd like to ask why he hasn't yet divorced from his second wife, Lucy; and whether he ever sees his son, Jasper, the result of a brief affair with a commissioning editor at Country Life which preceded the separation; and what went on with poor Anne Hills, who took an overdose on New Year's Eve 1996 after a 20-year on-off relationship with the earl; but instead, Snowdon is telling me about a trip to the cinema with Frances last week to see the new Scorsese film, which was awful, and about how he has converted her Paris bathroom into a darkroom, and how he's forever nipping over on Eurostar with his toolbox, and how he wishes the train would just shoot off the end of Brighton Pier with a great splash instead of slinking underground. This prompts another thought entirely, which leads to another, and to another: 'It's wonderful when you go to Moscow or St Petersburg - there are no railings in the parks or squares. It's all open, everyone can walk in. Why do we have to have these awful prissy little keys to go into a park? We should pull all the railings down. Get rid of them, open it all up, green grass, and make everyone welcome. It would be wonderful. It was like that during the war when all the railings were melted down. Unfortunately, they melted them up again. Why do you say \"melt down\" but not \"melt up\"? I was thinking about this the other day. You don't say, \"It's trying not to rain,\" do you? But you'd say, \"It's trying to rain.\" All these weather forecast things I love to listen to before I go to sleep. Don't you? The latest news from Fred Astaire and Rockall... We were going to do a film, John Betjeman and I. It was called Cloudy Bright, which used to be printed on packets of photographic film, I don't think it is any more. A lovely title, don't you think? Peter Sellers was going to be in it, and we had one meeting at the RAC Club in Pall Mall, for lunch, and we were stopped at the door because Peter didn't have a tie on, so he put one on, but inside the collar... those kind of rules drive me so mad. I remember once not being allowed into the dining room of the Mandarin hotel in Hong Kong because I wasn't wearing a tie, so I went out and bought a Mao jacket, and put it on, and they had to allow me in then because I was in the national costume.' All this means that I leave bamboozled and entirely empty-handed. A day or so later, a note arrives, thanking me for lunch. At the end, he has written, 'I only hope you got what you wanted.' I can hear his snuffle from here.",

The divers are swimming down and down, to see who can go the furthest and it becomes extremely claustrophobic. You experience an almost physical sensation of the pressure, and then the rush to the surface. I was watching it alone at three o'clock in the morning, because the others couldn't bear it, and I nearly had a panic attack.",

      "body": "<p>So instead of all the biblical plagues promised by the millennium, or the aluminium, as it's called in Dublin, we had the plague of lists. It was typical, somehow, of the desiccated nature of late 20th-century discourse and much, much safer than earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, skies spewing frogs, toads and computer-glitched aeroplanes. I've been asked to make them myself by a plague of publications, generally lists of my five, 10 or 100 favourite movies and have always said no. Not because I can't think of them, but because I can far more readily think of my favourite bits of movies than my favourite movies.<br>81/2, for example, will always live for me in the image of Marcello Mastroianni floating above a traffic-jam in Rome tied to a dirigible. Ziegfeld Follies may not be Vincente Minnelli's best movie, but there is an absolutely peerless three minutes in it where Judy Garland sings a paean to the woman in Belgium who invented the safety pin. For many critics, the Odessa Steps sequence is the highlight of Battleship Potemkin, but for me the most moving thing about the film is the way the whole bother was set in motion by a shot of an inedible bowl of soup. Eyes Without A Face will always be a film about a mask - that beautifully white, Japanese porcelain the doctor's daughter uses to cover her disfigured face - a version on any number of faces in the Scream series. And the first film I ever saw, I only ever remembered by a sound. It was a sound that heralded the approach of giant ants over a set of sand-dunes - which looked like every sand-dune I ever played on as a kid - in Them, a Fifties Warner B-movie.</p> <p>I could go on. Many dull movies are redeemed by unexpected, accidental bits of poetry. Many classics are nothing but those moments of poetry, connected by a narrative that has no other function than to make the necessary connections. Think of Vertigo, an unlikely story about a painting of a long-dead woman called Carlotta, a faked death and a chance meeting. Nobody who remembers that film remembers the plot. They remember three, perhaps four sequences of transcendent poetry which are all about memory, oddly enough.</p> <p>So perhaps a list of bits makes sense. Or says more about the way movies work on our consciousness than most of we filmmakers and critics would like to admit. I see that moment 88 on the current list is from Four Weddings And A Funeral. John Hannah recites an Auden poem. And I perhaps could admit that this moment was one of those - Truffaut called them 'privileged moments' in that rather po-faced academic way of his - which brought a smart, rather predictable, decidedly commercial film to a different kind of life. But what was moving was not so much the poem, it was the image of those grey, working-class housing estates around the churchyard, that grey British rain in a film that was so resolutely about warmth, wealth and happiness deferred but inevitably achieved. But it is the poem that is remembered.</p> <p>But if we examine the list further, we find the idea of quotation runs through it like the imitation stitching on a plastic football. The shower scene in Psycho has been quoted so often that the very sound - 'eee eee eee' - serves as a kind of shorthand for the whole of Hitchcock. The moments from 2001 and Apocalypse Now are wrapped in musical quotes - of Strauss and Wagner. Rutger Hauer's final speech in the rain in Blade Runner always seemed like a quote from Paradise Lost to me. Singin' In The Rain was quoted of course, by Kubrick in A Clockwork Orange, and if I come across another quote of De Niro's speech in Taxi Driver I think I will shoot the quoter.</p> <p>If we examine it even further, we find many moments from the dictionary of movie quotation, so to speak, from what one could call the common grammar, so often quoted as to have the dusty feel of a Latin primer. Two lovers parting in gaberdines and hats, a propeller turning. A spike scything through the spokes of a chariot wheel. A motorbike sailing over a barbed-wire fence. A distant whorl of dust in an infinity of desert that turns out to be a man on horseback. An insect-like thing emerging out of a human stomach.</p> <p>A bloodied male dying in a Christ-like position. A pram bouncing down a set of steps. An arm shooting up from a grave. An eye sliced by a razor blade.</p> <p>We have been taught to 'read' movies, of course, by a generation of critics, academics and theoreticians who, ironically, wanted to establish their subjects' essential status as movies, as opposed to filmed theatre, or literature. Movie as reference, as quotable quotes, then followed in the Seventies. I have never been comfortable with that. I always wanted, purely and simply, to look at films, and some garden of Eden was lost to me the first time I saw a shot that referred me to another shot. It seemed obscene to me that the image couldn't trust itself, that it referred to another version of itself before it could reveal its meaning. One could, of course, and people did, call it shorthand. But shorthand is a hieroglyph, a form of writing. And there's the rub - or the irony. The theoretical framework that was to free movies from their imagined literary shackles made them\u2026literal.</p> <p>But I wish some historian could define for me the point at which audiences began to read movies the way they read a book or a magazine. I realised this point had well and truly arrived when I sat in Los Angeles at a screening of Austin Powers, The Spy Who Shagged Me, among an audience hooting with laughter at a shot of a sportscar driving up the Hollywood Hills. The joke was, of course, that the scene was actually set in the English countryside. Or, to be really pedantic about it, the subtext of the joke was that movies are sometimes forced to use Los Angeles for London, or the reverse, and the really cheap ones can't maintain the illusion. Or something like that. But the eerie thing was that the audience was not looking at the movie. It was reading it.</p> <p>So maybe it is appropriate that at the top of the list is a kind of list. A shot of a noticeboard, filled with scrawled lists. Of all the images captured on celluloid since the invention of the camera, the favourite is one of a piece of handwriting. Should one laugh or cry? Or is this one of those Orwellian triumphs of the common sense of the ordinary public? Their favourite moment is where a story turns on a series of scrawls that have to be deciphered to reveal a secret. Their favourite moment in the history of movies is one they have to read.</p>",

      "byline": "Nigel Slater",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The wind whistles and moans at my kitchen door, rattling the cat flap and sending in enough of a draught to rustle the pages of the newspapers on the breakfast table. With a glass door, three outside walls and three skylights in what is little more than a galley, my new kitchen is a cold and inhospitable place in which to cook. So much for the kitchen being the heart of the home. Of course, this is a recent addition to a much older house, a kitchen that was tagged on to the back when there were no longer staff to bring dinner upstairs from the original basement kitchen, which, incidentally, is as warm and welcoming as freshly buttered toast.</p> <p>Old cookery books are full of recipes for keeping out the cold. While the French kept the wind at bay with goose fat and beans, and the Italians tuck into Bolito Misto, their national dinner of boiled meats in broth, the freezing Britons bubbled up potato-topped hotpots and made crusts of suet and flour. Leafing through early cookery books with their fatty lamb stews and steak-and-offal pies, you can see it was food, rather than swanky domestic heating, that kept the family warm. As the wind pierces every gap in my ill-fitting doors, it's a case of goodbye sushi, hello meat-and-potato pie.</p> <p>Cooking is not especially easy right now. No 10-minute suppers or main-course salads. It is as if I have been thrown into another era. Every meal seems to start with peeling onions, scrubbing carrots and mashing potatoes. There are bones boiling and puddings steaming. I feel as if I should be wearing a mop cap and an apron down to my ankles. </p> <p>In an effort to keep warm, I have taken to eating broth before supper. It warms and nourishes like nothing else, and has, so far, kept away the dreaded flu that has lain low so many of my friends. Nothing fancy, of course, just a good chicken boiled up with leeks, a parsnip, some carrots and several onions. I tuck in a few chicken wings for extra body and a tomato just to give it some colour. The broth that is left goes into the fridge and sets so stiff I can hold the dish upside down and it won't fall out. That's a free-ranger for you. The bones get strong on the exercise and are full of gelatin. A spoonful of that stock and I am once again ready to face the freezing cold. I tart up my bowl of broth according to my mood. Lemon juice and coriander - its soft leaves added at the last minute will invigorate. Parsley (why do we use this vivid green and earthy herb so little?) and some of the shredded chicken meat - blissfully bland and reassuring. I have also recently taken to boiling up a handful of pearl barley - its chewy nuttiness adds depth to any thin soup - and it takes just 20 minutes to boil. Overcooked and fluffy, it is even more sustaining. </p> <p>'Tis the season for starch, and I must admit to adding pasta, potatoes or beans to almost everything I eat at the moment. The palest of soups or stews warms up enormously with the addition of a covering of potato slices, added early enough to soften and take up some of the juice. If you turn up the temperature towards the end of the cooking time it will brown the potatoes, too. For beans, you can also read chick peas and greeny-brown lentils. The other good thing about tiny lentils is that they have a touch of spice to them, which seems to add extra warmth. </p> <p>This week, I made an old-fashioned stew with chicken and leeks, throwing it haphazardly together and chucking it into a low oven. I have never got the hang of oven timers, and setting the auto-cook programme on the average domestic cooker has always been a branch of rocket science to me. Successful slow cooking relies on my memory and the ability to smell when something is 'done'. In practice, I find stews are usually ready when I happen to remember they are still in the oven. But, with all that nourishing broth around, neither they nor I seem to come to grief. </p> <p><strong>Chicken-and-potato stew with parsley broth</strong></p> <p>You could use ready-cut chicken pieces here instead of buying a whole bird, except that you will be missing the undercarriage of the carcass, which adds much flavour as the stew simmers away in the oven. If you don't fancy jointing the bird yourself, ask your butcher - he will probably do it in about two minutes flat. <br>Serves 4</p> <p>100g pot barley <br>a large free-range chicken, jointed <br>a couple of tablespoons of dripping, goose fat or olive oil <br>2 large carrots, peeled <br>1 large parsnip, peeled <br>2 leeks, trimmed and soaked to remove any grit <br>3 medium sized stalks of celery <br>1 large onion, peeled <br>a few bay leaves, 3 or 4 sprigs of thyme, and half a dozen sage leaves enough light stock to cover - though water will do <br>4 small to medium-sized potatoes, peeled unless their skin is very thin <br>a small bunch of curly parsley <br>You will also need a large, deep pan with a lid </p> <p>Simmer the barley in salted water for about 20 minutes, until it feels reasonably tender, then drain it.</p> <p>Lightly brown the jointed chicken in the fat in a large, deep pan. One to which you have a lid. I do this in a relay, three or four pieces at a time. Remove the browned chicken to a plate. While the chicken is browning, you need to cut the carrot and parsnip into large chunks and the leek and celery into short lengths. I think it is important to keep the vegetables in fat juicy chunks for this. Cut the onion in half and then into large segments. Once the chicken is out add the vegetables, turn them in the fat and let them soften a little, though don't let them colour. Bring the stock to the boil. Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 5.</p> <p>Now return the chicken to the pan with the pearl barley then tuck in the herbs and pour over the hot stock, tucking all the herbs except the parsley in as you go.

      "bodyText": "The wind whistles and moans at my kitchen door, rattling the cat flap and sending in enough of a draught to rustle the pages of the newspapers on the breakfast table. With a glass door, three outside walls and three skylights in what is little more than a galley, my new kitchen is a cold and inhospitable place in which to cook. So much for the kitchen being the heart of the home. Of course, this is a recent addition to a much older house, a kitchen that was tagged on to the back when there were no longer staff to bring dinner upstairs from the original basement kitchen, which, incidentally, is as warm and welcoming as freshly buttered toast. Old cookery books are full of recipes for keeping out the cold. While the French kept the wind at bay with goose fat and beans, and the Italians tuck into Bolito Misto, their national dinner of boiled meats in broth, the freezing Britons bubbled up potato-topped hotpots and made crusts of suet and flour. Leafing through early cookery books with their fatty lamb stews and steak-and-offal pies, you can see it was food, rather than swanky domestic heating, that kept the family warm. As the wind pierces every gap in my ill-fitting doors, it's a case of goodbye sushi, hello meat-and-potato pie. Cooking is not especially easy right now. No 10-minute suppers or main-course salads. It is as if I have been thrown into another era. Every meal seems to start with peeling onions, scrubbing carrots and mashing potatoes. There are bones boiling and puddings steaming. I feel as if I should be wearing a mop cap and an apron down to my ankles. In an effort to keep warm, I have taken to eating broth before supper. It warms and nourishes like nothing else, and has, so far, kept away the dreaded flu that has lain low so many of my friends. Nothing fancy, of course, just a good chicken boiled up with leeks, a parsnip, some carrots and several onions. I tuck in a few chicken wings for extra body and a tomato just to give it some colour. The broth that is left goes into the fridge and sets so stiff I can hold the dish upside down and it won't fall out. That's a free-ranger for you. The bones get strong on the exercise and are full of gelatin. A spoonful of that stock and I am once again ready to face the freezing cold. I tart up my bowl of broth according to my mood. Lemon juice and coriander - its soft leaves added at the last minute will invigorate. Parsley (why do we use this vivid green and earthy herb so little?) and some of the shredded chicken meat - blissfully bland and reassuring. I have also recently taken to boiling up a handful of pearl barley - its chewy nuttiness adds depth to any thin soup - and it takes just 20 minutes to boil. Overcooked and fluffy, it is even more sustaining. 'Tis the season for starch, and I must admit to adding pasta, potatoes or beans to almost everything I eat at the moment. The palest of soups or stews warms up enormously with the addition of a covering of potato slices, added early enough to soften and take up some of the juice. If you turn up the temperature towards the end of the cooking time it will brown the potatoes, too. For beans, you can also read chick peas and greeny-brown lentils. The other good thing about tiny lentils is that they have a touch of spice to them, which seems to add extra warmth. This week, I made an old-fashioned stew with chicken and leeks, throwing it haphazardly together and chucking it into a low oven. I have never got the hang of oven timers, and setting the auto-cook programme on the average domestic cooker has always been a branch of rocket science to me. Successful slow cooking relies on my memory and the ability to smell when something is 'done'. In practice, I find stews are usually ready when I happen to remember they are still in the oven. But, with all that nourishing broth around, neither they nor I seem to come to grief. Chicken-and-potato stew with parsley broth You could use ready-cut chicken pieces here instead of buying a whole bird, except that you will be missing the undercarriage of the carcass, which adds much flavour as the stew simmers away in the oven. If you don't fancy jointing the bird yourself, ask your butcher - he will probably do it in about two minutes flat. Serves 4 100g pot barley a large free-range chicken, jointed a couple of tablespoons of dripping, goose fat or olive oil 2 large carrots, peeled 1 large parsnip, peeled 2 leeks, trimmed and soaked to remove any grit 3 medium sized stalks of celery 1 large onion, peeled a few bay leaves, 3 or 4 sprigs of thyme, and half a dozen sage leaves enough light stock to cover - though water will do 4 small to medium-sized potatoes, peeled unless their skin is very thin a small bunch of curly parsley You will also need a large, deep pan with a lid Simmer the barley in salted water for about 20 minutes, until it feels reasonably tender, then drain it. Lightly brown the jointed chicken in the fat in a large, deep pan. One to which you have a lid. I do this in a relay, three or four pieces at a time. Remove the browned chicken to a plate. While the chicken is browning, you need to cut the carrot and parsnip into large chunks and the leek and celery into short lengths. I think it is important to keep the vegetables in fat juicy chunks for this. Cut the onion in half and then into large segments. Once the chicken is out add the vegetables, turn them in the fat and let them soften a little, though don't let them colour. Bring the stock to the boil. Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 5. Now return the chicken to the pan with the pearl barley then tuck in the herbs and pour over the hot stock, tucking all the herbs except the parsley in as you go. Now slice the potatoes the thickness of pound coins and lay them over the top of the chicken and vegetables - some will inevitably sink, others will sit on top, the stock just lapping at their edges. Cover with a lid and place in the oven for an hour and a half, by which time the chicken and vegetables will be meltingly tender. Remove the lid, turn up the heat to 200C/gas mark 6 and leave for 30 minutes for the potatoes to colour here and there. Remove very carefully from the oven - the pan will be full and very hot - chop the parsley and sink it into the broth. Spoon the chicken, vegetables, barley and plenty of broth in to shallow bowls with flakes of sea salt and the pepper mill. Chicken pie with parsnip-and-potato mash Serves 6 for the chicken a medium-sized free-range chicken a handful of chicken wings 2 leeks, roughly chopped 1 large carrot, scrubbed and halved 1 onion, halved but unpeeled a tomato or two bay leaves, parsley stalks, a few sprigs of thyme and 8 whole black peppercorns for the pie a large spoonful of fat from the chicken, goose fat or butter 2 medium leeks 2 sticks celery, cut into thick slices 5 rashers of green bacon, trimmed of its rind bay leaves 6 medium-sized potatoes 4 medium parsnips a small head of broccoli, snapped into large florets a little flour a thick slice of butter for the mash Put the chicken into your largest saucepan, tucking the wings, vegetables, aromatics and herbs in around it. Pour in enough water to just cover the bird, then bring it to the boil over a high heat.

      "body": "<p>Sitting next to me at lunch yesterday was a man in search of rhubarb for his new garden. He said that he had been to his local garden centre and been laughed out of court. He had then asked and shopped around some more, but drew nothing but blanks. Perhaps it is just a country thing, but I think of rhubarb as a fixture - as much part of a garden as the lawn or buddleia. It is there because it has always been there. When I thought about it some more, however, I realised that I had got my own rhubarb from a highly unlikely source. </p> <p>It was exactly 10 years ago, and I was filming a rhubarb farm near Wakefield. God, it was cold. Grey sky, grey, soot-streaked buildings and grey slag heaps from the mines. It was a shock to a soft southerner to see a farm set into an industrial landscape. The rhubarb was grown outside in the sooty soil until it had developed a sufficiently substantial root - about two years later. It was then lifted and brought into low sheds where it was placed in rows, each one tightly butted against the next, directly on to the ground. There was no light in the shed, except from a few candles used by the pickers. It was cold and dank, but still and very beautiful. The rhubarb was forced by the dark to grow pale pink and very straight. Exhausted by its crepuscular harvest, each chunk of root - looking like a cross between a tree root and a piece of tofu - would be cut back, two or three flushes of shoots removed at a time, and then thrown away. I asked for some of these rejects and was told that I could take what I could carry. So I filled a sack with warty rhubarb root-logs, and they have been doing fine here ever since. </p> <p>Short of going round to a rhubarb farm in March or April when they clear the sheds, this, in principle, is the best way to get hold of some rhubarb: find someone with a mature plant and, some time in winter, after the leaves have died back, get them to lift a plant and chop it up into quarters with a sharp spade. Take a chunk with a couple of clearly visible buds and plant it in soil that you have dug and to which you have added plenty of compost or manure. The right depth should have the buds about an inch below the surface - but this is not critical. Mulch it thickly with more compost. If you have alkaline soil, it is a good idea to mulch each year with farmyard manure, as this tends to be acidic and rhubarb grows best with a pH of around 6.0. But it will survive and perform perfectly well on almost any soil, as long as it is well manured. </p> <p>Do not pick any stalks for the first year, and cut the flowers off as they appear, because they will reduce the quantity of stalks that grow next year. By the second year, you should have a good crop followed by a really good one two years after planting. It is a good idea to repeat this division every four years or so, chucking away the centre of the old plant as the new exterior pieces will grow with much more vigour. But why could my lunching companion not get any plants? Has rhubarb become an anachronism, the vegetative equivalent of a fattening pig in the back yard?

So, although rhubarb is restricted to the vegetable garden, it is first cousin to Rheum palmatum, which is inevitably part of any boggy or marginal planting. Rhubarb needs temperatures below 5\u00a1C to break its dormancy and stimulate spring growth, and dislikes temperatures higher than about 30\u00a1C. I suggest planting it with shade from the west, to protect it from the worst of the summer heat. But it does prefer a sunny site, so do not put it in deep shade. Baby leaves start to peek through the mulch that you spread thickly around it as soon as the leaves have died back. They come in two guises. If they are in the open, they are pink to the point of crimson, topped by a leaf so crinkled that it is almost as deep as it is wide. If you have forced the rhubarb by placing a bucket, old chimney pot or genuine bespoke terracotta rhubarb forcer over the top, the light-deprived shoots are much paler and the incipient leaf merely a lime-yellow spear-shaped spathe, a convoluted flame poised on top of a long, pink rhubarb candle.</p> <p>Rhubarb was first recorded in China in 2700 BC and, for centuries, it was imported for use as a purgative.

That is what everyone would very likely be writing.</p> <p>Look at it this way and it's now evident that, far from being an awful blow to his career, Portillo's defenestration from the Commons was the best possible thing that ever happened to him.

If only Portillo was the bull at the head of the herd, we might be within a shout of winning the next election.</p> <p>In this respect, the absence of Portillo has been very undermining of William Hague. So it was sensible to accelerate his return to the front bench and, up to a point, shrewd to place him in the exposed position of Shadow Chancellor.

For someone often described as the philosopher-prince of a `New Toryism', he has been silent about what this might come to in either theory or practice.

People talk of the New Portillo. Well, so they do in the Westminster Village and Media Gulch. What I wonder is whether he looks any different out there, beyond Parliament Square, in the real world where votes are cast. It's unarguable that he's a big hitter. In a Tory solar system mainly composed of black holes and brown dwarfs, Michael Portillo has stellar quality.</p> <p>What doesn't necessarily follow, as the man himself would probably privately acknowledge, is that this means the voters like him anymore than they did before. The only opinion poll I've found that bothered to ask the question suggests that the Conservatives would be even less popular led by Portillo. He is the man who was, in one previous incarnation, the Minister for the Poll Tax. He was Chief Secretary to the Treasury during the humiliation of Black Wednesday and when VAT was imposed on fuel. He was the foam-flecked ranter to the lowest prejudices of the Tory party conference.</p> <p>If these are not the things that the voters most recall about Michael Portillo, then you can be certain that Labour will do its best to remind the country why his defeat produced such paroxysms of delight. Elections are a contest between disillusion and fear: `kick the buggers out' versus `better the bastards you know'.</p> <p>The roles played by Labour and the Conservatives at the last election, and the four elections before that, will be reversed at the next. The Tories, as the insurgents, must look to ways of attracting fresh support. Labour, as the incumbents, will seek to keep its coalition together by terrifying the voters about the alternative. Does the prospect of Michael Portillo being resurrected as a Cabinet Minister make it easier or harder for Tony Blair to scare the country with the thought of the Tories returning to office? I merely note that, when it was announced that he was back on the Tory front bench, what I did not see was a crowd outside Central Office joyfully chanting: `Portillo's off the dole.'</p>",

What doesn't necessarily follow, as the man himself would probably privately acknowledge, is that this means the voters like him anymore than they did before. The only opinion poll I've found that bothered to ask the question suggests that the Conservatives would be even less popular led by Portillo. He is the man who was, in one previous incarnation, the Minister for the Poll Tax. He was Chief Secretary to the Treasury during the humiliation of Black Wednesday and when VAT was imposed on fuel. He was the foam-flecked ranter to the lowest prejudices of the Tory party conference. If these are not the things that the voters most recall about Michael Portillo, then you can be certain that Labour will do its best to remind the country why his defeat produced such paroxysms of delight. Elections are a contest between disillusion and fear: `kick the buggers out' versus `better the bastards you know'. The roles played by Labour and the Conservatives at the last election, and the four elections before that, will be reversed at the next. The Tories, as the insurgents, must look to ways of attracting fresh support. Labour, as the incumbents, will seek to keep its coalition together by terrifying the voters about the alternative. Does the prospect of Michael Portillo being resurrected as a Cabinet Minister make it easier or harder for Tony Blair to scare the country with the thought of the Tories returning to office? I merely note that, when it was announced that he was back on the Tory front bench, what I did not see was a crowd outside Central Office joyfully chanting: `Portillo's off the dole.'",

      "body": "<p>You're not paranoid - that computer really has got it in for you. Studies repeatedly show that modern workers are up to 50 per cent less effective than they should be. Why? </p> <p>It's partly because workers and employers do not think enough about their physical environment. Offices are boring. None of fiction's juicy visions of the future include them - unless I missed the Star Trek episode that had Captain Kirk slaving over a photocopier. </p> <p>Nor has the working environment ever been top of management's priorities. The result, say experts, is workplaces that kill creativity, increase absenteeism, and undermine productivity. They are even implicated in this winter's flu outbreak. </p> <p>But this may be about to change. 'We're beginning to unravel the two great mysteries of the modern workplace,' says John Jukes, an ergonomics and environmental stress consultant who has worked with companies in the UK, Europe and the US. </p> <p>'Why do 90 per cent of computer installations fail to meet their productivity specifications? And why do over 80 per cent of staff in ordinary offices suffer from the classic sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms of headache, tiredness, itchy and sore eyes, throat and skin, upper body pains, irritability and coughs?' </p> <p>The answers are all around - magnetic fields, poor lighting, poor air quality, sound levels, poor design. A book, Creating the Productive Workplace, edited by Derek Clements-Croome of Reading University, pulls the international research together. </p> <p>'We live and work through our five senses,' says Clements-Croome, 'and to thrive we need to use them. If they're blunted, we feel dissatisfied and creativity suffers. Why did monkeys die when we sent them into space? They suffered sensory deprivation and died of boredom. When this sort of deprivation occurs in the workplace, SBS symptoms result. They lower the immune system, so we succumb more readily to, say, a cold or flu.' (Couple this with a work culture that has us staggering on regardless of how sick we are, and you begin to see how a flu epidemic can take off.) </p> <p>The solution is intelligent buildings, says Clements-Croome, who runs the world's first MSc in the subject. 'Intelligent buildings are those which are adapted to their environment and function. Many offices are neither. Intelligent buildings need not be expensive. An igloo, for example, is very intelligent. Workplaces should be demand-led. They should be designed for the individuals using them.' </p> <p>He certainly does not buy the idea that the office will disappear with new technology. 'Working from home, virtual conferencing and so on will change the workplace - make it more fluid - not destroy it. People need the contact, the change of environment and the routine that shared work environments offer. What's important is that those environments, wherever they're found, provide the right conditions for productivity.' </p> <p>Indeed, as offices get both bigger, call centres, and smaller - boxrooms and bedroom corners - the need to get the essentials right increases. </p> <p>How does the research shape up in practice? Jukes worked through it systematically with a large UK service provider who wanted to close the 50 per cent shortfall between what its PC system was supposed to do and what the workforce were achieving. </p> <p>Enabling staff to sit at their VDUs correctly helped. So did encouraging them to take regular breaks, to blink regularly and to change their eyes' focal length by looking away occasionally. Ionisers, which neutralise the positively charged air produced by high levels of electrical equipment and synthetic materials, brought further benefits. </p> <p>The gap was finally closed when polarised daylight lighting was introduced. An ambient sound environment free of continuous machine noise took productivity into credit. When house plants finished off most remaining SBS symptoms, Jukes had a Eureka moment. 'We realised,' he says, 'that we were recreating the outdoors indoors. Not surprising really - as that's the environment we've evolved to cope with over 273,000 years.' </p> <p>Subsidised gym memberships and more flexible leave arrangements are two of the ways in which companies are gradually beginning to recognise the importance of their employees' health. </p> <p>Clements-Croome and Jukes expect this concern to move centre stage over the next few years - especially as research into the effects of emissions from electrical items develops.

      "bodyText": "You're not paranoid - that computer really has got it in for you. Studies repeatedly show that modern workers are up to 50 per cent less effective than they should be. Why? It's partly because workers and employers do not think enough about their physical environment. Offices are boring. None of fiction's juicy visions of the future include them - unless I missed the Star Trek episode that had Captain Kirk slaving over a photocopier. Nor has the working environment ever been top of management's priorities. The result, say experts, is workplaces that kill creativity, increase absenteeism, and undermine productivity. They are even implicated in this winter's flu outbreak. But this may be about to change. 'We're beginning to unravel the two great mysteries of the modern workplace,' says John Jukes, an ergonomics and environmental stress consultant who has worked with companies in the UK, Europe and the US. 'Why do 90 per cent of computer installations fail to meet their productivity specifications? And why do over 80 per cent of staff in ordinary offices suffer from the classic sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms of headache, tiredness, itchy and sore eyes, throat and skin, upper body pains, irritability and coughs?' The answers are all around - magnetic fields, poor lighting, poor air quality, sound levels, poor design. A book, Creating the Productive Workplace, edited by Derek Clements-Croome of Reading University, pulls the international research together. 'We live and work through our five senses,' says Clements-Croome, 'and to thrive we need to use them. If they're blunted, we feel dissatisfied and creativity suffers. Why did monkeys die when we sent them into space? They suffered sensory deprivation and died of boredom. When this sort of deprivation occurs in the workplace, SBS symptoms result. They lower the immune system, so we succumb more readily to, say, a cold or flu.' (Couple this with a work culture that has us staggering on regardless of how sick we are, and you begin to see how a flu epidemic can take off.) The solution is intelligent buildings, says Clements-Croome, who runs the world's first MSc in the subject. 'Intelligent buildings are those which are adapted to their environment and function. Many offices are neither. Intelligent buildings need not be expensive. An igloo, for example, is very intelligent. Workplaces should be demand-led. They should be designed for the individuals using them.' He certainly does not buy the idea that the office will disappear with new technology. 'Working from home, virtual conferencing and so on will change the workplace - make it more fluid - not destroy it. People need the contact, the change of environment and the routine that shared work environments offer. What's important is that those environments, wherever they're found, provide the right conditions for productivity.' Indeed, as offices get both bigger, call centres, and smaller - boxrooms and bedroom corners - the need to get the essentials right increases. How does the research shape up in practice? Jukes worked through it systematically with a large UK service provider who wanted to close the 50 per cent shortfall between what its PC system was supposed to do and what the workforce were achieving. Enabling staff to sit at their VDUs correctly helped. So did encouraging them to take regular breaks, to blink regularly and to change their eyes' focal length by looking away occasionally. Ionisers, which neutralise the positively charged air produced by high levels of electrical equipment and synthetic materials, brought further benefits. The gap was finally closed when polarised daylight lighting was introduced. An ambient sound environment free of continuous machine noise took productivity into credit. When house plants finished off most remaining SBS symptoms, Jukes had a Eureka moment. 'We realised,' he says, 'that we were recreating the outdoors indoors. Not surprising really - as that's the environment we've evolved to cope with over 273,000 years.' Subsidised gym memberships and more flexible leave arrangements are two of the ways in which companies are gradually beginning to recognise the importance of their employees' health. Clements-Croome and Jukes expect this concern to move centre stage over the next few years - especially as research into the effects of emissions from electrical items develops. Their latest study suggests that the extremely low frequencies from VDUs and mobile phones interfere with the brain's alpha and beta rhythms rather like interference on a radio - and with similarly unpredictable results. Jukes believes this could be responsible for a third of SBS symptoms. 'Offices are moderately lethal places, and we could be sitting on a time bomb,' he says. 'Most effects are invisible but if you want to see one, clean the dust from your VDU screen. As most airborne dust is dead skin, it should be grey - but you'll find it's black. The dust gets fried by electromagnetic fields, creating carbonised particulates that break into fine pieces and wreak havoc in the body's defence mechanisms.'
