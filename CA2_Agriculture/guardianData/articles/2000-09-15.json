But he is very good on the acrid solitude of a staled marriage and the difficulty of conquering one's debasing compulsions. And, as always, his writing is laced with a sharp, suggestive wit. \"Never underestimate the illusion of choice,\" cries the empire-building Quinn, neatly harpooning the paradox of capitalism. When he announces that the modern newspaper interview is a form \"as rigid and contrived as the the 18th-century gavotte\", journalists will flinch in recognition. </p> <p>Two sides of the triangle in Hare's own production are perfectly formed: Julia Ormond as Elsa not only comes up with an exact Scandinavian accent but hauntingly creates a woman who is irreparably damaged. Steven Mackintosh also has the right hollow-cheeked intensity as the poet who cannot quite quash his faith in the liberating embrace of alcohol. Only Tom Wilkinson, while conveying Quinn's capitalist grandeur, seems at the moment to be offering an unfinished sketch rather than a complete portrait.

As a result, thousands of pensioners have been receiving only the basic state pension while waiting indefinitely for their additional entitlements to be calculated and some people who retire in the near future could also be affected. \"We've heard from a number of people who have been affected and are angry at not getting the money they are entitled to,\" says a spokesperson for the charity Age Concern. \"It's very difficult for them to plan ahead when they don't know what their full provision will be.\" Help the Aged says: \"It's a scandal that thousands of pensioners are suffering from this mess, having to live on the basic state pension when many are due a substantial top-up. \"And the government still hasn't committed itself to righting the problem.\" In May, the Secretary of State for Social Security Jeff Rooker said that 128,000 pensioners were still waiting for their cases to be reviewed and that the Benefits Agency would complete its review of the backlog of retirement pension claims by the end of this year. But that may be optimistic. An Inland Revenue spokesperson said this week that the last claims should \"hopefully\"be sorted out by April 2001. However, slightly more encouraging news for pensioners in this predicament comes from the DSS. \"Anybody affected by this can ask their local Benefits Agency to do a manual calculation of their pension entitlement. \"This may take a bit of time, perhaps a couple of weeks, but once it has been done they should start to receive their full entitlement,\" said a spokesperson. On top of the one-off \u00a310 compensation payment, peo ple who have already been waiting some time for their full pension entitlement to be worked out may also be eligible for compensation under the DSS' general special payments scheme. To qualify, the arrears owed must be more than \u00a3100, the delay suffered must be more than eight months and any potential compensation must be worth \u00a310 or more. Application details are available from local benefits agencies.",

The National Consumer Council says that because the card is pre-paid, teenagers can spend only the amount which parents have agreed to.

But it adds that less well-off mums and dads are inevitably going to come under pressure from their offspring to take out a card or top it up. Other card news \u0095 RBS Advanta has launched the lowest-cost credit card in the UK - an introductory annual percentage rate (APR) of 2.9 for both purchases and balance transfers until June 1 2001. But after that, the standard rate of 17.9 will apply (16.9 for the platinum version of the card). \u0095 After years of looking down its nose at the wave of low-cost, no-frills credit cards launched in the UK, Barclaycard is quietly test-marketing one of its own. Selected Barclays customers are being invited to sign up for Barclaycard Alpha, which has no annual fee, a standard rate of 14.9 APR on purchases and a 5.9 APR balance transfer rate. \u0095 People's Bank and Virgin Mobile have joined forces so that anyone taking out a People's Bank platinum credit card can take advantage of an introductory rate of 4.9 APR for purchases and balance transfers, plus obtain \u00a350 off Virgin Mobile's new Siemens M35i handset, which currently sells for \u00a3119.99.",

So for most young families, the priority is to pay as little as possible for essential protection you hope you will never need to call upon,\" Ms Bradshaw says. </p> <p>\"Family income benefit, which can be arranged to pay you an index-linked annual income, gives you the level of protection you need at a lower cost than straight term insurance.

It is relatively straightforward to calculate what income your dependents would need to live on if you were to die. It's trickier to work out what lump sum they'd require to invest in order to generate an adequate income over a period of years, given the unpredictable ups and downs of inflation. And, should the worst happen, the last thing your bereaved partner will feel able to cope with is deciding how to invest a lump sum to produce an income while the children are still dependent. Arranging for them to receive an inflation-linked income will relieve them of any such worries. </p> <p>FIB is cheaper than level term insurance because, as time goes by, the overall payout on FIB is less and therefore the risk to the insurer is less. Take the example of the FIB policy above paying out an inflation-linked income of \u00a315,000 per year over a 20-year term. If the insured were to die in year one, their dependents would receive \u00a315,000 (plus inflation) each year for the next 19 years - a total of \u00a3285,000 (plus inflation). Were they to die in, say, year 10 the total payout would reduce to \u00a3150,000 (plus inflation). So the cost and risk to the insurer reduces over time. </p> <p> If the insured died leaving a 20-year level term policy paying out a \u00a3250,000 lump sum, the payout would remain the same whenever during the term their demise occurred. </p> <p>Barry Davys, an independent financial adviser specialising in family protection products, agrees that FIB is slightly cheaper than term insurance and that, in the event of a bereavement, it can simplify the need to manage finances. </p> <p>But, he says: \"Given that the difference in cost is relatively small, unless pennies are critical, I feel term insurance provides better value because you get full cover throughout the term. </p> <p>\"Also, though it's true that working out how to invest a lump sum can be a problem for a recently bereaved person, I've come across many who are very glad of a lump sum rather than an income, especially where the deceased has left substantial debts - which is often the case in my experience.

If you are an employee, another benefit of early filing is that the Revenue will collect any underpayment below \u00a31,000 through your PAYE code for 2001-02 and you will not have to pay it next January. </p> <p> <strong> If I have not been sent a tax return form, I do not need to worry about tax.</strong> </p> <p> False. If in 1999/2000 you had income or capital gains which were not fully taxed, you must notify the Revenue in writing no later than October 5.

You need not delay filing just because you do not have all the information you need. For example, if you are still awaiting details of income you received from a bank or building society, or benefits-in-kind from your employment, you may enter a 'provisional figure' on the form, tick box 22.3, and then supply the correct figure after filing, when you obtain it (see page 27 of the tax return guide). </p> <p> <strong> I cannot complete the form as I have lost details of some of my income.</strong> </p> <p> False. The taxman accepts that it is sometimes necessary to make an estimate - for example, if records have been lost or destroyed. This is explained under 'Other estimates' on page 27 of the guide.

      "body": "<p>The vast majority of British people spent the week wondering if their petrol tanks would run dry. But actuaries - the people who find accountancy too exciting - were focused on one thing only; the government's review of occupational pension schemes. </p> <p>Their excitement was not misplaced. The outcome of the review will affect everybody who has a company pension scheme - that's 12.5m people - and will have a critical impact on financial markets, for big and small investors alike. It spells higher costs for employers - they will have to shovel more money into pension schemes because we are all living longer. </p> <p>It spells a possible sell-off in the gilts market, so if you hold government stock it may fall in value. It suggests a shift to pension funds buying corporate bonds, so if you have invested in a corporate bond Pep or Isa, it's probably good news. And if you are retiring soon and are aghast at the lousy annuity rates on offer, it may mean slightly better returns. </p> <p>At issue is a complex device called the minimum funding requirement (MFR), which was introduced in the aftermath of Robert Maxwell's \u00a3400m raid on the Mirror pension schemes. Well-meaning experts devised the MFR as a way of ensuring that the cash in a pension fund more or less matched its future liabilities to pay out incomes to a company's retired workers. </p> <p>But as the chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, Alan Pickering, said this week: \"The cure has turned out to be worse than the disease.\" </p> <p>The problem with the MFR is that it has effectively forced pension funds into buying ultra-safe government stock - known as gilts - to ensure that their liabilities are fully covered. </p> <p>At the same time the government, whose coffers have been swelling with the tax receipts of a booming economy, has not been inclined to issue gilts. The result of lots of buyers chasing very little supply is that the price of gilts has been forced up and the yield has been forced down. </p> <p>The pension funds have been left with a preponderance of low-yielding gilts which offer their investors poor long-term returns compared to investing in shares, or even bonds. They have therefore been clamouring for a new MFR measure that will allow them to value their future liabilities using higher-yielding corporate bonds rather than gilts. </p> <p>The actuarial profession produced a report, published this week, which says there is no loss of pension security if the funds invest in a basket of corporate bonds rather than gilts. The DSS, which authorises the MFR, is inclined to accept the proposals, but this week said it wants more time for consultation. So what are the implications for your pension and your investments? </p> <p><strong>Your pension</strong><br> </p> <p>Watch out for employers who use the new MFR to dump costly final salary pension schemes. Hidden towards the back of the MFR proposals was also an interim recommendation that employers pay higher contributions to cover the fact that people are living longer. The MFR was devised in 1995, but since then new mortality figures suggest that pensioners will on average live two years longer than initially thought. </p> <p>The DSS and the Institute of Actuaries are therefore proposing that employers increase their contributions by 6.5%, which translates into an extra \u00a3700m a year for the next two years and \u00a3400m a year thereafter. Employers are already fighting against the increased burden. </p> <p>The CBI says: \"We are concerned about the interim changes proposed by the Institute of Actuaries. Government figures suggest that the price tag will be \u00a32.5bn over the next five years. Companies would strongly oppose implementing the interim changes ahead of a long-overdue review.\" </p> <p>One big firm of actuaries which advises companies on their schemes, Punter Southall, warned that companies' resistance to the extra cost will encourage them to switch out of final salary schemes into money purchase schemes, which are widely considered as a second-class deal for pensioners. \"It's going to continue to accelerate the switch to money purchase schemes. We support the concept of final salary schemes, but this adds to the cost of what are already expensive schemes.\" </p> <p><strong>Your annuity</strong><br> </p> <p>Many holders of personal pension schemes have been shocked to discover that even if they have saved up a large sum, all it buys at retirement is a small annual income, called an annuity. Ten years ago \u00a3100,000 bought an annual income of \u00a311,000 for a 65-year-old. Today it buys around \u00a35,800 a year. Part of the reason for the collapse has been the MFR, because annuity rates are based on the yield on long-dated gilts. </p> <p>Many are hoping that a revised MFR will boost annuities, as the yield on gilts rises. Earlier this week the yield on 15-year gilts rose from 5.1% to 5.2% in anticipation of the MFR review and analysts believe this move has further to go. </p> <p>But no analysts are predicting a sudden sharp increase in gilt yields, with some saying that the MFR proposals will not have the impact on yields that many anticipated. So annuities may improve, but only marginally. </p> <p><strong>Your investments</strong><br> </p> <p>Corporate bond holders - through funds such as corporate bond Peps and Isas - should be happy. Whereas the City was expecting the MFR review to see a widening of the valuation measure to include triple or double-A grade bonds as well as gilts, the Institute of Actuaries' proposals went further. It recommends that the basket of bonds should include anything that is investment grade, which means bonds rated BBB and above, which make up the majority of bonds held in Peps and Isas. </p> <p>As pension funds begin to buy more corporate bonds, their prices rise, which means that the capital value of the investment in a corporate bond fund rises. \"It's positive for the corporate bond market from a growth perspective, and ultimately from a performance perspective. No one will be selling corporate bonds today,\" said Barclays Capital after the announcement. </p> <p>However, there's never a one-way ride in the City. If you hold a long-dated gilt, which can be bought over the counter at Post Offices, or if you inherited War Loan stock or Consols, a switch from gilts to bonds could see their capital value fall marginally. </p> <p>Finally, there is some speculation that equities will be long-term losers. City analysts were this week suggesting that some pension funds will not only shift out of gilts to bonds, but also out of equities to bonds. </p> <p>\"The market believes that the review seems to be more positive for fixed-income markets at the expense of equities. However, while agreeing with this sentiment, we are not convinced that this will be the final outcome. The government wants people to invest in venture capital, so why would you encourage them away from equities?\" said Barclays Capital.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The vast majority of British people spent the week wondering if their petrol tanks would run dry. But actuaries - the people who find accountancy too exciting - were focused on one thing only; the government's review of occupational pension schemes. Their excitement was not misplaced. The outcome of the review will affect everybody who has a company pension scheme - that's 12.5m people - and will have a critical impact on financial markets, for big and small investors alike. It spells higher costs for employers - they will have to shovel more money into pension schemes because we are all living longer. It spells a possible sell-off in the gilts market, so if you hold government stock it may fall in value. It suggests a shift to pension funds buying corporate bonds, so if you have invested in a corporate bond Pep or Isa, it's probably good news. And if you are retiring soon and are aghast at the lousy annuity rates on offer, it may mean slightly better returns. At issue is a complex device called the minimum funding requirement (MFR), which was introduced in the aftermath of Robert Maxwell's \u00a3400m raid on the Mirror pension schemes. Well-meaning experts devised the MFR as a way of ensuring that the cash in a pension fund more or less matched its future liabilities to pay out incomes to a company's retired workers. But as the chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, Alan Pickering, said this week: \"The cure has turned out to be worse than the disease.\" The problem with the MFR is that it has effectively forced pension funds into buying ultra-safe government stock - known as gilts - to ensure that their liabilities are fully covered. At the same time the government, whose coffers have been swelling with the tax receipts of a booming economy, has not been inclined to issue gilts. The result of lots of buyers chasing very little supply is that the price of gilts has been forced up and the yield has been forced down. The pension funds have been left with a preponderance of low-yielding gilts which offer their investors poor long-term returns compared to investing in shares, or even bonds. They have therefore been clamouring for a new MFR measure that will allow them to value their future liabilities using higher-yielding corporate bonds rather than gilts. The actuarial profession produced a report, published this week, which says there is no loss of pension security if the funds invest in a basket of corporate bonds rather than gilts. The DSS, which authorises the MFR, is inclined to accept the proposals, but this week said it wants more time for consultation. So what are the implications for your pension and your investments? Your pension Watch out for employers who use the new MFR to dump costly final salary pension schemes. Hidden towards the back of the MFR proposals was also an interim recommendation that employers pay higher contributions to cover the fact that people are living longer. The MFR was devised in 1995, but since then new mortality figures suggest that pensioners will on average live two years longer than initially thought. The DSS and the Institute of Actuaries are therefore proposing that employers increase their contributions by 6.5%, which translates into an extra \u00a3700m a year for the next two years and \u00a3400m a year thereafter. Employers are already fighting against the increased burden. The CBI says: \"We are concerned about the interim changes proposed by the Institute of Actuaries. Government figures suggest that the price tag will be \u00a32.5bn over the next five years. Companies would strongly oppose implementing the interim changes ahead of a long-overdue review.\" One big firm of actuaries which advises companies on their schemes, Punter Southall, warned that companies' resistance to the extra cost will encourage them to switch out of final salary schemes into money purchase schemes, which are widely considered as a second-class deal for pensioners. \"It's going to continue to accelerate the switch to money purchase schemes. We support the concept of final salary schemes, but this adds to the cost of what are already expensive schemes.\" Your annuity Many holders of personal pension schemes have been shocked to discover that even if they have saved up a large sum, all it buys at retirement is a small annual income, called an annuity. Ten years ago \u00a3100,000 bought an annual income of \u00a311,000 for a 65-year-old. Today it buys around \u00a35,800 a year. Part of the reason for the collapse has been the MFR, because annuity rates are based on the yield on long-dated gilts. Many are hoping that a revised MFR will boost annuities, as the yield on gilts rises. Earlier this week the yield on 15-year gilts rose from 5.1% to 5.2% in anticipation of the MFR review and analysts believe this move has further to go. But no analysts are predicting a sudden sharp increase in gilt yields, with some saying that the MFR proposals will not have the impact on yields that many anticipated. So annuities may improve, but only marginally. Your investments Corporate bond holders - through funds such as corporate bond Peps and Isas - should be happy. Whereas the City was expecting the MFR review to see a widening of the valuation measure to include triple or double-A grade bonds as well as gilts, the Institute of Actuaries' proposals went further. It recommends that the basket of bonds should include anything that is investment grade, which means bonds rated BBB and above, which make up the majority of bonds held in Peps and Isas. As pension funds begin to buy more corporate bonds, their prices rise, which means that the capital value of the investment in a corporate bond fund rises. \"It's positive for the corporate bond market from a growth perspective, and ultimately from a performance perspective. No one will be selling corporate bonds today,\" said Barclays Capital after the announcement. However, there's never a one-way ride in the City. If you hold a long-dated gilt, which can be bought over the counter at Post Offices, or if you inherited War Loan stock or Consols, a switch from gilts to bonds could see their capital value fall marginally. Finally, there is some speculation that equities will be long-term losers. City analysts were this week suggesting that some pension funds will not only shift out of gilts to bonds, but also out of equities to bonds. \"The market believes that the review seems to be more positive for fixed-income markets at the expense of equities. However, while agreeing with this sentiment, we are not convinced that this will be the final outcome. The government wants people to invest in venture capital, so why would you encourage them away from equities?\" said Barclays Capital.",

It prompted a large postbag to Jobs &amp; Money, with much of the anger directed at the two credit reference agencies, Experian and Equifax, which dominate the business in the UK. This week Jobs &amp; Money highlights the six major areas where problems repeatedly crop up and how you can challenge the agencies and ensure that your file is corrected. Anyone can apply to the agencies for a copy of their file - it costs \u00a32 - but recent surveys have shown that up to one in 10 files contain errors. The errors may not seem X-rated, but they can lead to an embarrassing credit rejection in a store or, at worst, refusal to give you a mortgage. Your file contains four major types of information. The crucial piece of data is your entry on the electoral roll, as the lack of a ID card system in the UK means the roll is the only way that lenders, especially new telephone and internet-based \"remote\" companies, can identify whether you are who you say you are. Secondly, the file details your repay ment history, warning lenders if you have been in arrears or have defaulted on a credit agreement. Thirdly, it holds the details on any county court judgments recorded against you and, fourthly, it tells lenders about the credit history of related parties, such as your family and other credit applicants at the same address. But it is not Experian or Equifax that accepts or rejects you - it is the lenders which interpret the data and take the decision whether to lend. The good news is that the 1998 Data Protection Act, which comes into force in October next year, will give you more rights to challenge anything held about you - by asking for a \"notice of dispute\" - and will restrict the automatic right of the agencies to use third-party information.",

That won't do nicely</strong><br> </p> <p>You may have lived and worked in Britain for decades, you may even have a wife or husband who is British, but if you don't hold British citizenship you can largely forget about applying for credit. </p> <p>Several angry Americans and Australians wrote to us about how they are constantly refused credit, even though their financial position is perfectly sound. The problem is the electoral roll; non-British citizens are not on the roll, and therefore almost don't exist as far as the credit reference agencies are concerned. Madonna may live in Britain and go out with Guy Ritchie, but she better not apply for a British credit card. </p> <p>Lianne Kordan came to Britain in the 60s from the US with her parents, and is constantly discriminated against. Ashley McEwen married an Englishman and works as a senior PA in the film business in London. </p> <p>Yet her building society rejected her application for a Visa card. She was one of the luckier ones - at least she was told it was because she's not on the electoral roll. </p> <p>\"I pointed out that I was joint-owner of a mortgage and had a long-standing bank account in the UK. Their only attempt at a compromise was to ask me to send two years' worth of bank statements to prove my credit-worthiness. At this point I had had enough and so dropped the enquiry, but the incident still riles me,\" she says. </p> <p>Both Experian and Equifax insist that all a non-British citizen has to do is to provide them with proof of identity, which will be added to the file so that lenders will not automatically refuse credit; if they do refuse on this basis alone, it is breaking industry guidelines. But the experience of Jobs &amp; Money readers is that these guidelines are indeed regularly broken. </p> <p>At Rackhams department store during the January sales the shop assistant convinced Lianne Kordan that she should apply for a storecard to obtain a further 10% discount. But minutes later the assistant returned and gingerly told her: \"I'm afraid Madam, we have a slight problem... \" </p> <p>Being rejected for credit is a problem that Ms Kordan has lived with all her life. Her parents, American academics, came to Britain from the US in the 60s in protest at the Vietnam war. But because she has never given up her US citizenship, she is all but invisible to the credit reference agencies which use the electoral roll to confirm anybody's identity. Her problem is not unique; it affects all non-British citizens who live in the UK. </p> <p>Ms Kordan works in information development for public and higher education authorities, so is no stranger to how databases work. She contacted Experian, which told her to supply evidence of her identity and proof of residency. Experian says: \"The existence of such a statement prevents an automatic credit scoring decision being made and means the statement is seen by anybody searching the file in the future. We also notify anyone who has searched the file within the past six months.\" </p> <p>Ms Kordan says: \"They say this, but it's not what actually happens. You get an operative on the other end of the line who rejects you. They say they do not have the authority to go to that level in my credit file. I tell them they have my permission, but it doesn't make any difference.\" </p> <p>Experian says it is \"mystified\" by Ms Kordan's continued problems. \"This consumer's application would, by law, be referred out of any automatic scoring system and referred for a 'manual' decision. She should be dealt with by someone more senior and should definitely appeal against these decisions.\" </p> <p>However, Ms Kordan draws little comfort from Experian's assurances. \"The problem is that you can't even make it to first base. They're just using a system, the electoral roll, that was never designed to be used as a credit mechanism.\" </p> <p><strong>Alias Smith, Jones and Patel</strong><br> </p> <p>Mr Smith moved into a flat in London five years ago, unaware that another Mr Smith lived in a flat in the same building. Last March he applied for a temporary overdraft from First Direct and was refused, but was recommended to check his file at Experian. Even though he had moved out of the flats 10 months earlier, Experian linked his file to the other Mr Smith, and he suspects this may be why he was refused the overdraft. </p> <p>\"The need for the overdraft has now thankfully passed, but I am pursuing the matter in an effort to find out who is making the decision where. Experian links us to another Smith at our old address although we have requested that they 'disconnect' us. Smithism anyone?\" he says. </p> <p>Experian says that same surnames do cause mix-ups, but plays down how significant the problem is. \"Previous occupants with the same surname do occassionally appear to be concurrent because of the vagaries of updating the electoral roll. It is not fair to say this problem is 'quite common' but it can happen, and, if it does and we are advised that no financial connection exists, we will ensure that the connection is severed,\" says Experian. </p> <p>Equifax admits that if you have lived in a block with other same surname residents, there is a problem. \"If you live in flats with lots of dwellings, it can be a particular problem,\" says an Equifax spokes-man. His advice? \"If you have a common name and have moved recently, get a copy of your file, see who you are associated with, and then ask for a notice of disassociation.\" </p> <p>The problem is, most people won't apply for a file until after they have been rejected. In the US, where the credit reference agencies are even more powerful, consumers can pay $20 a year to have their file sent to them every quarter, so they can easily pick up mistakes. But there are no plans to introduce such a system here. </p> <p><strong>The sins of the fathers</strong><br> </p> <p>Mark Jenkins (not his real name) was turned down for a Halifax mortgage in January this year, prompting him to check the information held on him at Experian and Equifax. He discovered that there was no way for lenders to distinguish between him and his father, who had run into financial difficulties after an industrial accident. </p> <p>Mr Jenkins had the same first name, middle initial and surname as his father, plus they had lived at the same address about six years earlier. The obvious way to differentiate between them is by using date of birth - but, surprisingly, neither Experian or Equifax put this on their systems. </p> <p>\"Dates of birth do not form part of the file, so we would not be able to distinguish between two people with exactly the same name at the same address. We would usually ask the consumer to identify which entries belonged to whom,\" says Experian. </p> <p>Mr Jenkins did so, and said Experian replied promptly. However, although it deleted his association with his father, Experian then listed his address incorrectly, which caused further delays. </p> <p>Equifax refused to drop his father from his file unless he submitted both birth certificates. Mr Jenkins did so. A month later, when a copy of his new Equifax file arrived, he found that the agency had deleted not just his father's details, but nearly all of his as well. \"My credit reference now consisted of my name and address, hardly conducive to inspiring confidence in mortgage lenders,\" he says. \"The whole ridiculous performance has been extremely frustrating, particularly since house prices have leapt over the past year. I still have no idea whether I will be able to get a mortgage. I would appreciate anything that could be done to force the credit agencies to keep more accurate records.\" </p> <p>The agencies say they do their best to keep accurate records, and are forced to do so by Data Protection and Consumer Credit legislation. Mr Jenkins, it appears, may have a strong case for compensation. \"We consider requests for compensation on a case by case basis,\" say the agencies. </p> <p>Mr Jenkins' case highlights how family connections -known as third party data -can cause significant problems, particulary among estranged partners. Experian says parents, children and ex-wifes or ex-husbands are not forever entwined in a credit file. \"We will create disassociations if no financial connections exist. Just ask us.\" </p> <p><strong>Denied credit by a false default</strong><br> </p> <p>One of the more worrying problems encountered by a Jobs &amp; Money reader began after he bought a sofa at Courts Furnishings on a three-month interest free loan. The reader, who wants to remain anonymous, describes himself as a public sector accountant of \"boring financial rectitude\". He only discovered that Courts had incorrectly registered him as defaulting on the loan when he was turned down for a Nationwide Flex Account. </p> <p>\"I discovered that Courts had registered an eight-rating against the loan, even though it had been settled in full. The payment was by direct debit, but the month after it was cleared a further payment was taken. I contacted them and it was put back into my account. Over the next two years I had repeated demands for the money which, of course, I did not owe, including a notification of proceedings. Each time I phoned and was assured the matter was settled and Courts sent letters of apology. It ceased in 1995. But in 1996 there was a posting to Experian with the eight-rating, indicating that the account was only settled after legal action.\" </p> <p>Naturally, he demanded that Experian remove the rating. It refused. \"Their response was that they could only act on the instruction of Courts, which I found astonishing.\" </p> <p>Experian says: \"We would not have 'refused' to remove it. We would have explained that we need first to query the matter with the lender which provided and owned the information. We will and do remove incorrect information. While we do this we mark the data as 'in dispute'. If we fail to satisfy a customer, he or she can complain to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner who will investigate.\" </p> <p>Courts has subsequently apologised and paid the complainant \u00a3500 in compensation, and Nationwide has accepted his application. But his alarming experience is a warning about the dangers of using direct debits, and the need to keep meticulous records - and defaults can be registered against you without you ever knowing. </p> <p><strong>Victims marked as 'fraudsters' </strong><br> </p> <p>Imagine the shock of another Jobs &amp; Money reader (understandably, he also wishes to remain anonymous) when he saw that his credit file accused him of being a fraudster. </p> <p>\"A warning from credit industry fraud busters 'Cifas' warning appeared on my records alleging that when applying for a Capital One credit card saying I had provided a 'genuine name and address' but had included 'material falsehoods and/or omissions in personal details or other relevant information', \" says our reader. </p> <p>Letters to Cifas and Capital One failed to explain what was wrong with my application in the first place. Capital One's initial tactic was to ignore me, it then moved on to say that it could not 'enter into the specifics of my application.'\" </p> <p>Equifax says Cifas alerts on a file do not indicate that they think you are a fraudster. It may be that a credit card has been stolen and used fraudulently, with the lender posting this information on the system. \"It's there to protect lenders and consumers,\" says an Equifax spokesman. </p> <p>He says a Cifas alert should not lead to an automatic rejection. Instead, it produces an automatic referral, where the lender is obliged to speak to the organisation that posted the alert. </p> <p>But the system is far from foolproof. For example, Cifas alerts are attached to addresses rather than individuals, because lenders believe certain addresses are used time and again for making fraudulent applications. </p> <p>Individuals cannot request to have the alert removed. Experian says that if the Cifas alert is incorrect (\"people dealing with fraud prevention tend to be wary of revealing their methodology\"), then the consumer should ask Cifas to investigate and make an amendment if necessary. </p> <p><strong>Where to get help</strong></p> <p>For a copy of your credit reference agency file, write to Experian, Customer Help Service, PO Box 8000, Nottingham NG1 5GX or Equifax, Dept 1E, PO Box 3001, Glasgow G81 2DT.

At close range, that alchemy was tangible, mesmerising, reaffirmative. It was Bob Dylan, reborn yet again. Tonight at Conference Centre, Aberdeen (01224 824824), then on tour.",

      "body": "<p>Chelsea looked like a team with other things on their mind last night as they struggled to beat the champions of Switzerland. But the recriminations were few. As soon as the final whistle sounded the club's thoughts returned to the rest of Europe where they hope to find a manager to lead them to greater glories than competing in the Uefa Cup. </p> <p>By a process of elimination and the injection of common-sense into the proceedings - the presence of George Graham, Terry Venables and John Gregory in the succession speculation had threatened to turn it into a joke - the leading contender now appears to be Frank Rijkaard. </p> <p>When asked yesterday if he was interested in replacing Gianluca Vialli or had been in touch with Chelsea, the normally forthcoming Rijkaard was unusually diplomatic - \"I don't comment on my connections with a club until the deal is done.\" </p> <p>It was interpreted by those who know him as signifying that something is afoot. </p> <p>Rijkaard is very highly thought of. Although he resigned as Holland coach after they failed to win Euro 2000 on home soil, 92 per cent in a Dutch poll shortly afterwards thought he should not have fallen on his sword, while 87 per cent rated him the best coach in the championship. </p> <p>Even the media were impressed with the way he dealt with them and, though Rijkaard has coached only at international level, a host of top European clubs have filed his name for future use. </p> <p>Last night Chelsea's chairman Ken Bates was giving no clues, apart from definitely ruling out Venables and Graham, and reiterating the view that \"we will not be hurried into a decision\" on a new manager. </p> <p>As for his decision to sack Vialli, Bates acknowledged he was the most successful manager in Chelsea history, that he was \"a true gentleman\" and that sacking him \"was the most difficult and distressing action I have ever had to take\". </p> <p>For their part the Chelsea fans in last night's far-from-capacity crowd blamed Vialli's sacking on Frank Leboeuf, booing the Frenchman's first touch of the ball, presumably because of his recent revelation that \"everybody has problems with Vialli\". </p> <p>The task of picking up the pieces fell to the caretaker manager Graham Rix. Trying to pull the players' thoughts away from the managerial hubbub on to a game against a small-town side must have been difficult. But Rix took the bull by the horns, fielding three strikers and giving the midfielder Sam dalla Bona his first start. </p> <p>St Gallen, Swiss champions for the first time since 1904, may be a backwater club playing in Europe for the first time since 1985, but they only narrowly lost to Galatasaray, the defending Uefa Cup holders, in the qualifying round. </p> <p>The fact that Chelsea were playing in the Uefa Cup for the first time rather than duelling in the lucrative Champions League, as they did last season, was a factor in Vialli's downfall. But the players began the game eagerly. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, twice, and Tore Andre Flo went close before Christian Panucci put Chelsea ahead after 22 minutes. </p> <p>A great ball from Dennis Wise found him in the area and the Italian defender saw his shot cannon off the keeper and loop over the line. It was his first Chelsea goal. </p> <p>However, St Gallen had done enough to warn Chelsea against complacency. Pereirs Guido forced a diving save from Carlo Cudicini on nine minutes and Jerren Nixon shot just wide on 34. </p> <p>Swiss hopes were raised further at the start of the second half as Chelsea started giving the ball away with alarming regularity.

      "bodyText": "Chelsea looked like a team with other things on their mind last night as they struggled to beat the champions of Switzerland. But the recriminations were few. As soon as the final whistle sounded the club's thoughts returned to the rest of Europe where they hope to find a manager to lead them to greater glories than competing in the Uefa Cup. By a process of elimination and the injection of common-sense into the proceedings - the presence of George Graham, Terry Venables and John Gregory in the succession speculation had threatened to turn it into a joke - the leading contender now appears to be Frank Rijkaard. When asked yesterday if he was interested in replacing Gianluca Vialli or had been in touch with Chelsea, the normally forthcoming Rijkaard was unusually diplomatic - \"I don't comment on my connections with a club until the deal is done.\" It was interpreted by those who know him as signifying that something is afoot. Rijkaard is very highly thought of. Although he resigned as Holland coach after they failed to win Euro 2000 on home soil, 92 per cent in a Dutch poll shortly afterwards thought he should not have fallen on his sword, while 87 per cent rated him the best coach in the championship. Even the media were impressed with the way he dealt with them and, though Rijkaard has coached only at international level, a host of top European clubs have filed his name for future use. Last night Chelsea's chairman Ken Bates was giving no clues, apart from definitely ruling out Venables and Graham, and reiterating the view that \"we will not be hurried into a decision\" on a new manager. As for his decision to sack Vialli, Bates acknowledged he was the most successful manager in Chelsea history, that he was \"a true gentleman\" and that sacking him \"was the most difficult and distressing action I have ever had to take\". For their part the Chelsea fans in last night's far-from-capacity crowd blamed Vialli's sacking on Frank Leboeuf, booing the Frenchman's first touch of the ball, presumably because of his recent revelation that \"everybody has problems with Vialli\". The task of picking up the pieces fell to the caretaker manager Graham Rix. Trying to pull the players' thoughts away from the managerial hubbub on to a game against a small-town side must have been difficult. But Rix took the bull by the horns, fielding three strikers and giving the midfielder Sam dalla Bona his first start. St Gallen, Swiss champions for the first time since 1904, may be a backwater club playing in Europe for the first time since 1985, but they only narrowly lost to Galatasaray, the defending Uefa Cup holders, in the qualifying round. The fact that Chelsea were playing in the Uefa Cup for the first time rather than duelling in the lucrative Champions League, as they did last season, was a factor in Vialli's downfall. But the players began the game eagerly. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, twice, and Tore Andre Flo went close before Christian Panucci put Chelsea ahead after 22 minutes. A great ball from Dennis Wise found him in the area and the Italian defender saw his shot cannon off the keeper and loop over the line. It was his first Chelsea goal. However, St Gallen had done enough to warn Chelsea against complacency. Pereirs Guido forced a diving save from Carlo Cudicini on nine minutes and Jerren Nixon shot just wide on 34. Swiss hopes were raised further at the start of the second half as Chelsea started giving the ball away with alarming regularity. St Gallen could not capitalise and the first chance fell to the home side when the defender Daniel Imhof nearly headed past his own goal keeper. But Chelsea wore an increasingly subdued look. The events of the week semed to be taking their toll and shouts of \"Vialli, Vialli\" ringing around the ground did not help. On this showing, Chelsea need a new manager as soon as possible. Chelsea (4-3-3): Cudicini; Panucci, Leboeuf, Desailly, Le Saux; Di Matteo, Wise, Dalla Bona; Flo, Hasselbaink, Zola. St Gallen (4-4-2): Astiel; Zellweger, Imhof, Zwyssig, Dal Santo; Winkler, Mueller, Guido, Nixon; Jairo, Amoah. Referee: V Torres (Spain).",

She carries the BBC's burden of being a public service broadcaster in competition with commercial genre channels. Apart from slugging it out in the ratings war, with Heggessey leading from the front, the unanswered question remains: what is the BBC for? Email the Media Medium at: maggie@companyguide.co.uk",

      "byline": "Michael White and Kevin Maguire",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> Tony Blair looked the most relieved man in Britain yesterday as the petrol crisis eased after the wheels had been close to falling off his government. </p> <p> A senior Downing Street official, asked if the government would be adopting a \"triumphalist\" tone, wryly conceded: \"I cannot imagine this has helped the government's standing.\" </p> <p> The tone of the prime minister's third No 10 press conference in as many days was distinctly contrite after such a narrow escape. Mr Blair insisted his policies were right, but admitted he had been caught on the hop. Lessons will be learned about crisis management - and about monitoring disputes before they become crises. </p> <p> The more fundamental question is whether it has done long-term harm to new Labour's hard won reputation for competent economic management, or whether the crisis headlines will evaporate almost as quickly as the crisis itself developed last weekend. </p> <p> The short-term damage to Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and John Prescott - and lesser ministers in the crossfire - is obvious. As Mr Blair admitted, they were caught unaware by the speed of the blockades' impact on a \"just in time\" society whose petrol stations and supermarkets hold just enough stock to get by for a day or so. </p> <p> In the first misjudgment, Downing Street and other Whitehall departments thought the protests would fade away rather than spread when they started at the end of last week. </p> <p> Mr Blair realised there was a serious problem only on Monday night when demonstrators blocked his way to a Chinese restaurant in Hull for dinner with Mr Prescott. The following day he pulled out of a regional tour and trip to the TUC in Glasgow to return to the Downing Street bunker. </p> <p> Britain was running out of fuel and heading for a shutdown potentially more disastrous than the winter of discontent or the three-day week during Edward Heath's era. </p> <p> Only on Wednesday did it finally appear as if the government was getting to grips with the crisis as Mr Blair summoned oil industry executives to read the riot act to the global corporations accused of colluding with the demonstrators. </p> <p> It has been a bad week for government dignity in a year when it has been battered by events as disparate as asylum seekers, NHS cash, leaked Blair memos, cashpoint fines and Euan Blair's GCSE celebrations. The only upside of the fuel crisis is that it has distracted public attention from the tottering Greenwich dome. </p> <p> Potentially worse for the PM is the accusation, levelled by yesterday's Daily Telegraph, that the crisis was final proof that Mr Blair's is an arrogant government that does not listen to the kind of unBlairite small businessmen who manned the picket lines, to ordinary voters, or even to its own MPs. </p> <p> \"We've been warning Gordon about petrol prices for months now,\" one minister muttered this week. Despite Mr Blair's repeated refusal to bow to intimidation by small unrepresentative groups, many Labour MPs are certain that concessions will have to be made inside the 60-day deadline imposed by truckers. </p> <p> That will be a crucial test for the chancellor. As with the single parent benefit revolt in 1997 and this year's 75p increase in the basic pension, plenty of MPs will be whispering that Mr Brown is too powerful and too inflexible for the government's own good. \"Tony should rein him in,\" they will say again. </p> <p> The arrogance charge - rejected yesterday by Mr Blair - is more dangerous when tied to William Hague's \"stealth tax\" jibe. The prime minister, chancellor and their colleagues have done their best to explain that world prices are the main culprit and that the extra petrol taxes they imposed in 1997-99 were of Tory origin, caused by the Tory debts they had to clear. </p> <p> Last March's decision to scrap the fuel escalator inherited from the Tories, and used during Labour's early years, has been cited as evidence that the government is listening. The argument has convinced few voters. </p> <p> The Downing Street machine has sought scapegoats: the pickets, the police, and the Opec oil producers. It has also resorted to shroud waving, getting the health secretary, Alan Milburn, to put the NHS into the firing line. The tabloids will attack him for playing politics with the sick. But it worked. Along with the prospect that the army would be sent in the risk of pickets being blamed for deaths helped tip them - and the tabloids - away from further confrontation. </p> <p> Yet ministers persistently refused to go to war, at least in public, with the major oil companies, the one obvious scapegoat whose foot dragging, self-interested tactics could have united pickets, public and ministers against them. Yesterday's own goal by Esso in raising prices before performing a swift U-turn showed what scope was there. </p> <p> Downing Street optimists hope that once voters have reflected on the dispute they will turn against small groups of politically motivated pickets with a vocally anti-Labour agenda. </p> <p> There is even some hope that the crisis will help make voters less car dependent as they discover the joys of fast-moving buses, bikes and unpolluted pavements. But they are almost certainly being over-optimistic. </p> <p> Demonstrators tapped into public resentment against the highest petrol prices in Europe when Britain has North Sea oil. </p> <p> By backing down yesterday before causing the widespread disruption just round the corner, they deprived Mr Blair of the great victory some in No 10 hoped he could achieve.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair looked the most relieved man in Britain yesterday as the petrol crisis eased after the wheels had been close to falling off his government. A senior Downing Street official, asked if the government would be adopting a \"triumphalist\" tone, wryly conceded: \"I cannot imagine this has helped the government's standing.\" The tone of the prime minister's third No 10 press conference in as many days was distinctly contrite after such a narrow escape. Mr Blair insisted his policies were right, but admitted he had been caught on the hop. Lessons will be learned about crisis management - and about monitoring disputes before they become crises. The more fundamental question is whether it has done long-term harm to new Labour's hard won reputation for competent economic management, or whether the crisis headlines will evaporate almost as quickly as the crisis itself developed last weekend. The short-term damage to Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and John Prescott - and lesser ministers in the crossfire - is obvious. As Mr Blair admitted, they were caught unaware by the speed of the blockades' impact on a \"just in time\" society whose petrol stations and supermarkets hold just enough stock to get by for a day or so. In the first misjudgment, Downing Street and other Whitehall departments thought the protests would fade away rather than spread when they started at the end of last week. Mr Blair realised there was a serious problem only on Monday night when demonstrators blocked his way to a Chinese restaurant in Hull for dinner with Mr Prescott. The following day he pulled out of a regional tour and trip to the TUC in Glasgow to return to the Downing Street bunker. Britain was running out of fuel and heading for a shutdown potentially more disastrous than the winter of discontent or the three-day week during Edward Heath's era. Only on Wednesday did it finally appear as if the government was getting to grips with the crisis as Mr Blair summoned oil industry executives to read the riot act to the global corporations accused of colluding with the demonstrators. It has been a bad week for government dignity in a year when it has been battered by events as disparate as asylum seekers, NHS cash, leaked Blair memos, cashpoint fines and Euan Blair's GCSE celebrations. The only upside of the fuel crisis is that it has distracted public attention from the tottering Greenwich dome. Potentially worse for the PM is the accusation, levelled by yesterday's Daily Telegraph, that the crisis was final proof that Mr Blair's is an arrogant government that does not listen to the kind of unBlairite small businessmen who manned the picket lines, to ordinary voters, or even to its own MPs. \"We've been warning Gordon about petrol prices for months now,\" one minister muttered this week. Despite Mr Blair's repeated refusal to bow to intimidation by small unrepresentative groups, many Labour MPs are certain that concessions will have to be made inside the 60-day deadline imposed by truckers. That will be a crucial test for the chancellor. As with the single parent benefit revolt in 1997 and this year's 75p increase in the basic pension, plenty of MPs will be whispering that Mr Brown is too powerful and too inflexible for the government's own good. \"Tony should rein him in,\" they will say again. The arrogance charge - rejected yesterday by Mr Blair - is more dangerous when tied to William Hague's \"stealth tax\" jibe. The prime minister, chancellor and their colleagues have done their best to explain that world prices are the main culprit and that the extra petrol taxes they imposed in 1997-99 were of Tory origin, caused by the Tory debts they had to clear. Last March's decision to scrap the fuel escalator inherited from the Tories, and used during Labour's early years, has been cited as evidence that the government is listening. The argument has convinced few voters. The Downing Street machine has sought scapegoats: the pickets, the police, and the Opec oil producers. It has also resorted to shroud waving, getting the health secretary, Alan Milburn, to put the NHS into the firing line. The tabloids will attack him for playing politics with the sick. But it worked. Along with the prospect that the army would be sent in the risk of pickets being blamed for deaths helped tip them - and the tabloids - away from further confrontation. Yet ministers persistently refused to go to war, at least in public, with the major oil companies, the one obvious scapegoat whose foot dragging, self-interested tactics could have united pickets, public and ministers against them. Yesterday's own goal by Esso in raising prices before performing a swift U-turn showed what scope was there. Downing Street optimists hope that once voters have reflected on the dispute they will turn against small groups of politically motivated pickets with a vocally anti-Labour agenda. There is even some hope that the crisis will help make voters less car dependent as they discover the joys of fast-moving buses, bikes and unpolluted pavements. But they are almost certainly being over-optimistic. Demonstrators tapped into public resentment against the highest petrol prices in Europe when Britain has North Sea oil. By backing down yesterday before causing the widespread disruption just round the corner, they deprived Mr Blair of the great victory some in No 10 hoped he could achieve.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair looked the most relieved man in Britain yesterday as the petrol crisis eased after the wheels had been close to falling off his government. A senior Downing Street official, asked if the government would be adopting a \"triumphalist\" tone, wryly conceded: \"I cannot imagine this has helped the government's standing.\" The tone of the prime minister's third No 10 press conference in as many days was distinctly contrite after such a narrow escape. Mr Blair insisted his policies were right, but admitted he had been caught on the hop. Lessons will be learned about crisis management - and about monitoring disputes before they become crises. The more fundamental question is whether it has done long-term harm to new Labour's hard won reputation for competent economic management, or whether the crisis headlines will evaporate almost as quickly as the crisis itself developed last weekend. The short-term damage to Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and John Prescott - and lesser ministers in the crossfire - is obvious. As Mr Blair admitted, they were caught unaware by the speed of the blockades' impact on a \"just in time\" society whose petrol stations and supermarkets hold just enough stock to get by for a day or so. In the first misjudgment, Downing Street and other Whitehall departments thought the protests would fade away rather than spread when they started at the end of last week. Mr Blair realised there was a serious problem only on Monday night when demonstrators blocked his way to a Chinese restaurant in Hull for dinner with Mr Prescott. The following day he pulled out of a regional tour and trip to the TUC in Glasgow to return to the Downing Street bunker. Britain was running out of fuel and heading for a shutdown potentially more disastrous than the winter of discontent or the three-day week during Edward Heath's era. Only on Wednesday did it finally appear as if the government was getting to grips with the crisis as Mr Blair summoned oil industry executives to read the riot act to the global corporations accused of colluding with the demonstrators. It has been a bad week for government dignity in a year when it has been battered by events as disparate as asylum seekers, NHS cash, leaked Blair memos, cashpoint fines and Euan Blair's GCSE celebrations. The only upside of the fuel crisis is that it has distracted public attention from the tottering Greenwich dome. Potentially worse for the PM is the accusation, levelled by yesterday's Daily Telegraph, that the crisis was final proof that Mr Blair's is an arrogant government that does not listen to the kind of unBlairite small businessmen who manned the picket lines, to ordinary voters, or even to its own MPs. \"We've been warning Gordon about petrol prices for months now,\" one minister muttered this week. Despite Mr Blair's repeated refusal to bow to intimidation by small unrepresentative groups, many Labour MPs are certain that concessions will have to be made inside the 60-day deadline imposed by truckers. That will be a crucial test for the chancellor. As with the single parent benefit revolt in 1997 and this year's 75p increase in the basic pension, plenty of MPs will be whispering that Mr Brown is too powerful and too inflexible for the government's own good. \"Tony should rein him in,\" they will say again. The arrogance charge - rejected yesterday by Mr Blair - is more dangerous when tied to William Hague's \"stealth tax\" jibe. The prime minister, chancellor and their colleagues have done their best to explain that world prices are the main culprit and that the extra petrol taxes they imposed in 1997-99 were of Tory origin, caused by the Tory debts they had to clear. Last March's decision to scrap the fuel escalator inherited from the Tories, and used during Labour's early years, has been cited as evidence that the government is listening. The argument has convinced few voters. The Downing Street machine has sought scapegoats: the pickets, the police, and the Opec oil producers. It has also resorted to shroud waving, getting the health secretary, Alan Milburn, to put the NHS into the firing line. The tabloids will attack him for playing politics with the sick. But it worked. Along with the prospect that the army would be sent in the risk of pickets being blamed for deaths helped tip them - and the tabloids - away from further confrontation. Yet ministers persistently refused to go to war, at least in public, with the major oil companies, the one obvious scapegoat whose foot dragging, self-interested tactics could have united pickets, public and ministers against them. Yesterday's own goal by Esso in raising prices before performing a swift U-turn showed what scope was there. Downing Street optimists hope that once voters have reflected on the dispute they will turn against small groups of politically motivated pickets with a vocally anti-Labour agenda. There is even some hope that the crisis will help make voters less car dependent as they discover the joys of fast-moving buses, bikes and unpolluted pavements. But they are almost certainly being over-optimistic. Demonstrators tapped into public resentment against the highest petrol prices in Europe when Britain has North Sea oil. By backing down yesterday before causing the widespread disruption just round the corner, they deprived Mr Blair of the great victory some in No 10 hoped he could achieve.",

Bradford's second-choice keeper Gary Walsh has joined Middlesbrough on a month's loan. Swindon's home match against Cambridge has been called off because of the fuel crisis. TEAM NEWS IN BRIEF Lucas Radebe has been ordered to rest by a neurologist as he is suffering from headaches after sustaining concussion during Leeds's midweek match against Barcelona. Ipswich will leave last season's leading scorer David Johnson on the bench, with Marcus Stewart playing up front. Chelsea are expected to be without Celestine Babayaro, Ed de Goey, Gustavo Poyet and Mario Stanic for Sunday's game against Leicester. Neil Lennon, who is still troubled by a shoulder injury, is the Foxes' only doubt. George Weah will return to the Manchester City attack for Sunday's game against Middlesbrough at Maine Road. Bradford will travel to Aston Villa without Andy Myers, who tore a hamstring in the 1-1 draw with Arsenal last week. Peter Reid has refused to rule out a return for goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen for the visit of Derby County to the Stadium of Light. Sorensen was back in full training for the first time today and could replace Jurgen Macho. Igor Stimac is struggling to shake off a virus in time to face Liverpool on Sunday. Frank Lampard, who has been bothered by a persistent ankle injury all season, is definitely out, while Frederic Kanoute and Trevor Sinclair are also doubtful. Liverpool hope to have Steven Gerrard back in their side, but Sami Hyypia will still be missing.

      "body": "<p>Timothy Everest is on a personal mission to rekindle Britain's reputation as the foremost influence on, and producer of, menswear in the world. But this is no Mission: Impossible (Everest dressed Tom Cruise in both recent films). Timothy Everest is part of the new generation of bespoke tailors (Richard James and Oswald Boateng being the other notable contenders) who are shaking off tailoring's stuffy image while retaining its impeccable quality and attention to detail. </p> <p>He celebrates his tenth anniversary this month and his client list reads like a Who's Who of the world's rich and famous. But now his talents are available to many more punters than his 3,500 bespoke customers. Everest has been drafted in by Marks &amp; Spencer to inject life into the store's menswear by producing an exclusive collection for their Autograph range, due to hit the stores on October 12. It will be in addition to his Sartorial suiting line, produced for M&amp;S for several seasons. </p> <p>But Autograph is not just a nip and tuck administered to Marks' menswear. The store hopes this is the start of a turnaround in the way their menswear is perceived. It will be sold in a dedicated in-store area of its own and will serve as the masthead for a complete revision of menswear for the UK's largest clothing retailer. </p> <p>Everest is quietly confident about Autograph. \"The first collection is a good start. When I arrived at Marks &amp; Spencer, I thought it would be an easier task because they're a British institution and my style is very British. But I soon realised this British institution didn't have many British offerings. They were selling top quality Italian-style suits in great fabrics for a third of what you'd pay for a designer suit, but there was no British menswear as I think of it. Maybe there's an existing client base who aren't being served and maybe we can bring in a younger customer, too. I've tried to build a collection for someone who wants great separates - a check pant or roll-neck - as well as suits which I covered with the Sartorial line.\" </p> <p>Pitching to M&amp;S, Everest sought to convince them where the real strengths in British menswear lay. \"In producing a collection about modern Britain, I looked back to photos of people like David Bailey and Mick Jagger. I discovered British menswear was more rugged than we remembered. It was more kitchen-sink drama than Austin Powers and I've tried to marry that ruggedness with a Jermyn Street eccentricity. The quality, the fit and the detailing are very good, and it's made in Britain.\" </p> <p>Everest is moving in two directions at once: mass market with M&amp;S, upmarket with bespoke. \"Not everyone can afford, is interested in or has the time for bespoke and I want to make the business even more secretive. I like being off the beaten track [in London's now fashionable but formerly run-down Spitalfields]. OK, someone might buy an Autograph suit and work up, but they're really separate. I don't want to be pigeonholed in this hip new-bespoke movement or become a designer fashion brand.\" </p> <p>But what future has the suit in a Britain populated by tracksuited dads and trendy-denimed youth? Most men don't even wear a suit to work any more. \"I attended a dinner recently at which Derek Hatton spoke and he told a story about his mate who runs a dress hire shop for funerals. I thought: 'Oh no, here comes the scouser gag' but it wasn't. He said it was doing really well because kids attending funerals were buying a boring black suit and black tie and liking it. Because their dads dress casual, don't know how to tie a tie and perhaps have never worn a suit, they think they're being cool and cutting edge. So they're buying suits. For them, tailoring is not old-fashioned, it's something completely new.\" </p> <p>In addition to the core bespoke business, Everest has launched a ready-to-wear menswear line and will introduce womenswear next spring. He's dressed Tom Cruise, Robin Williams and Burt Bacharach for the Oscars and designed formalwear and parade costumes for the British Olympic team. Busy boy, but that's not all: for four months, he has also been working on the renaissance of another British institution, DAKS Simpson, in his role as creative director. The first stage in its rebirth as cutting edge brand is the opening of a store on London's Bond Street this autumn and an ad campaign which, Everest says, is to \"signal we're doing something new without frightening people\". His first solo collection will not go in-store until autumn 2001. </p> <p>This kind of make-over is known in the trade as \"doing a Burberry\" (which in turn \"did a Gucci\"). \"What frustrates me is that designers like Ralph Lauren thrive on a past that never existed. Why aren't we doing that ourselves? There's lots of synergy between my business and DAKS as it's already a British institution and I am trying to build one. It took Burberry three years to get it right: I want to get DAKS right in two.\" </p> <p>The problem for DAKS and M&amp;S will be to draw younger men away from the lure of the Diesels, Armanis and Hilfigers of this world, with their colossal marketing budgets. Does Everest believe kids reared on branded casualwear will mature into stylish Autograph or DAKS wearers? \"I was the ultimate fashion victim when I was young, but today to be fashionable is old-fashioned because anyone can buy any look they want. You just have to pick up a magazine and it tells you what to wear. To be individual is the only way to be new.\" </p> <p>So there you have it. Timothy Everest, potential saviour of British menswear, believes fashionable is old-fashioned. Or, put another way, suits are the new jeans.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It's been a while since any novelist arrived on the literary scene with quite such an explosion as Zadie Smith. Now that the dazzle is subsiding, there is the inevitable cloud of smoke: most conspicuously she didn't, as expected, win the Orange Prize (one judge, apparently, declared \"over my dead body\"). But Oranges are not the only fruit: Smith is certain to win some prize or other before this year is out. </p> <p>In the last eight months Smith, the daughter of a Jamaican mother and English father, who set her novel in Willesden where she still lives, has developed a combative public persona, pronouncing on everything from immigration policy to the shortage of proper fiction. But it's the work that counts, and there was unanimous critical agreement that this story of three families, spanning three generations, marked a fine and important debut. The Observer was first off the mark, with Caryl Phillips pointing out that it \"squares up to the two questions which gnaw at the very roots of our modern condition. Who are we? Why are we here?\" </p> <p>Inevitably, Smith's influences were discussed at length. Hugo Barnacle, in the Sunday Times, noted that: \"She writes very much in Rushdie's style... But the humour is lighter; the drollery and wordplay are not so relentless.\" Maya Jaggi, in the Guardian, heard echoes of Edward Said, Sam Selvon and Michael Ondaatje, while in the Express Meera Syal pointed out that Smith offered both a supremely modern story of millennial Britain and \"a curiously old-fashioned one, with Arabian Nights -style storytelling\". </p> <p>One quality that is undoubtedly Smith's own is her ear for dialogue, the motor which drives the comedy of the novel. Christian House, in the Independent on Sunday, enthused that \"from the rolling Jamaican patois to the stilted mumbles of adolescence, each voice is perfectly captured\". But it's a rare critic who will offer unqualified praise, and House noticed \"the odd chink in the research\", while, interestingly, Caryl Phillips found it \"frustrating not to have a more substantial white family at the heart of the novel\". These cavils perhaps account for Harvey Porlock's remark in the Sunday Times that there was something \"oddly patronising\" about the coverage of this important book.</p>",

Now that the dazzle is subsiding, there is the inevitable cloud of smoke: most conspicuously she didn't, as expected, win the Orange Prize (one judge, apparently, declared \"over my dead body\"). But Oranges are not the only fruit: Smith is certain to win some prize or other before this year is out. In the last eight months Smith, the daughter of a Jamaican mother and English father, who set her novel in Willesden where she still lives, has developed a combative public persona, pronouncing on everything from immigration policy to the shortage of proper fiction. But it's the work that counts, and there was unanimous critical agreement that this story of three families, spanning three generations, marked a fine and important debut. The Observer was first off the mark, with Caryl Phillips pointing out that it \"squares up to the two questions which gnaw at the very roots of our modern condition. Who are we? Why are we here?\" Inevitably, Smith's influences were discussed at length. Hugo Barnacle, in the Sunday Times, noted that: \"She writes very much in Rushdie's style... But the humour is lighter; the drollery and wordplay are not so relentless.\" Maya Jaggi, in the Guardian, heard echoes of Edward Said, Sam Selvon and Michael Ondaatje, while in the Express Meera Syal pointed out that Smith offered both a supremely modern story of millennial Britain and \"a curiously old-fashioned one, with Arabian Nights -style storytelling\". One quality that is undoubtedly Smith's own is her ear for dialogue, the motor which drives the comedy of the novel. Christian House, in the Independent on Sunday, enthused that \"from the rolling Jamaican patois to the stilted mumbles of adolescence, each voice is perfectly captured\". But it's a rare critic who will offer unqualified praise, and House noticed \"the odd chink in the research\", while, interestingly, Caryl Phillips found it \"frustrating not to have a more substantial white family at the heart of the novel\". These cavils perhaps account for Harvey Porlock's remark in the Sunday Times that there was something \"oddly patronising\" about the coverage of this important book.",

      "body": "<p>Early in the morning, late in the century, Cricklewood Broadway. At 06.27 hours on 1 January 1975, Alfred Archibald Jones was dressed in corduroy and sat in a fume-filled Cavalier Musketeer Estate face down on the steering wheel, hoping the judgement would not be too heavy upon him. He lay forward in a prostrate cross, jaw slack, arms splayed either side like some fallen angel; scrunched up in each fist he held his army service medals (left) and his marriage licence (right), for he had decided to take his mistakes with him. A little green light flashed in his eye, signalling a right turn he had resolved never to make. He was resigned to it. He was prepared for it. He had flipped a coin and stood staunchly by its conclusions. This was a decided-upon suicide. In fact it was a New Year's resolution. </p> <p>But even as his breathing became spasmodic and his lights dimmed, Archie was aware that Cricklewood Broadway would seem a strange choice. Strange to the first person to notice his slumped figure through the windscreen, strange to the policemen who would file the report, to the local journalist called upon to write 50 words, to the next of kin who would read them. Squeezed between an almighty concrete cinema complex at one end and a giant intersection at the other, Cricklewood was no kind of place. It was not a place a man came to die. It was a place a man came in order to go other places via the A41. But Archie Jones didn't want to die in some pleasant, distant woodland, or on a cliff edge fringed with delicate heather. The way Archie saw it, country people should die in the country and city people should die in the city. Only proper. In death as he was in life and all that. It made sense that Archibald should die on this nasty urban street where he had ended up, living alone at the age of 47, in a one-bedroom flat above a deserted chip shop. He wasn't the type to make elaborate plans - suicide notes and funeral instructions - he wasn't the type for anything fancy. All he asked for was a bit of silence, a bit of shush so he could concentrate. He wanted it to be perfectly quiet and still, like the inside of an empty confessional box or the moment in the brain between thought and speech. He wanted to do it before the shops opened. </p> <p>Overhead, a gang of the local flying vermin took off from some unseen perch, swooped, and seemed to be zeroing in on Archie's car roof - only to perform, at the last moment, an impressive U-turn, moving as one with the elegance of a curve ball and landing on the Hussein-Ishmael, a celebrated halal butchers. Archie was too far gone to make a big noise about it, but he watched them with a warm internal smile as they deposited their load, streaking white walls purple. He watched them stretch their peering bird heads over the Hussein-Ishmael gutter; he watched them watch the slow and steady draining of blood from the dead things - chickens, cows, sheep - hanging on their hooks like coats around the shop. The Unlucky. These pigeons had an instinct for the Unlucky, and so they passed Archie by. For, though he did not know it, and despite the Hoover tube that lay on the passenger seat pumping from the exhaust pipe into his lungs, luck was with him that morning. The thinnest covering of luck was on him like fresh dew. Whilst he slipped in and out of consciousness, the position of the planets, the music of the spheres, the flap of a tiger-moth's diaphanous wings in Central Africa, and a whole bunch of other stuff that Makes Shit Happen had decided it was second-chance time for Archie. Somewhere, somehow, by somebody, it had been decided that he would live. </p> <p>~</p> <p>The Hussein-Ishmael was owned by Mo Hussein-Ishmael, a great bull of a man with hair that rose and fell in a quaff, then a ducktail. Mo believed that with pigeons you have to get to the root of the problem: not the excretions but the pigeon itself. The shit is not the shit (this was Mo's mantra); the pigeon is the shit. So the morning of Archie's almost-death began as every morning in the Hussein-Ishmael, with Mo resting his huge belly on the windowsill, leaning out and swinging a meat cleaver in an attempt to halt the flow of dribbling purple. </p> <p>\"Get out of it! Get away, you shit-making bastards! Yes! SIX!\" </p> <p>It was cricket, basically - the Englishman's game adapted by the immigrant, and six was the most pigeons you could get at one swipe. </p> <p>\"Varin!\" said Mo, calling down to the street, holding the bloodied cleaver up in triumph. \"You're in to bat, my boy. Ready?\" </p> <p>Below him on the pavement stood Varin - a massively overweight Hindu boy on misjudged work experience from the school round the corner, looking up like a big dejected blob underneath Mo's question mark. It was Varin's job to struggle up a ladder and gather spliced bits of pigeon into a small Kwik Save carrier bag, tie the bag up, and dispose of it in the bins at the other end of the street. </p> <p>\"Come on, Mr. Fatty-man,\" yelled one of Mo's kitchen staff, poking Varin up the arse with a broom as punctuation for each word. \"Get-your-fat-Ganesh-Hindu-backside- up-there-Elephant-Boy-and-bring-some-of-that-mashed -pigeon-stuff-with-you.\" </p> <p>Mo wiped the sweat off his forehead, snorted, and looked out over Cricklewood, surveying the discarded armchairs and strips of carpet, outdoor lounges for local drunks; the slot-machine emporiums, the greasy spoons and the minicabs - all covered in shit. One day, so Mo believed, Cricklewood and its residents would have cause to thank him for his daily massacre; one day no man, woman or child in the broadway would ever again have to mix one part detergent to four parts vinegar to clean up the crap that falls on the world. The shit is not the shit, he repeated solemnly, the pigeon is the shit. Mo was the only man in the community who truly understood. He was feeling really very Zen about this - very goodwill-to-all-men - until he spotted Archie's car. </p> <p>\"Arshad!\"</p> <p>A shifty-looking skinny guy with a handlebar moustache, dressed in four different shades of brown, came out of the shop, with blood on his palms. </p> <p>\"Arshad!\" Mo barely restrained himself, stabbed his finger in the direction of the car. \"My boy, I'm going to ask you just once.\" </p> <p>\"Yes, Abba?\" said Arshad, shifting from foot to foot. </p> <p>\"What the hell is this? What is this doing here? I got delivery at 6.30. I got 15 dead bovines turning up here at 6.30. I got to get it in the back. That's my job. You see? There's meat coming. So, I am perplexed -\" Mo affected a look of innocent confusion. \"Because I thought this was clearly marked 'Delivery Area'.\" He pointed to an aging wooden crate which bore the legend NO PARKINGS OF ANY VEHICLE ON ANY DAYS. \"Well?\" </p> <p>\"I don't know, Abba.\" </p> <p>\"You're my son, Arshad. I don't employ you not to know. I employ him not to know\" - he reached out of the window and slapped Varin, who was negotiating the perilous gutter like a tightrope-walker, giving him a thorough cosh to the back of his head and almost knocking the boy off his perch - \"I employ you to know things. To compute information. To bring into the light the great darkness of the creator's unexplainable universe.\" </p> <p>\"Abba?\" </p> <p>\"Find out what it's doing there and get rid of it.\" </p> <p>Mo disappeared from the window. A minute later Arshad returned with the explanation. \"Abba.\" </p> <p>Mo's head sprang back through the window like a malicious cuckoo from a Swiss clock. </p> <p>\"He's gassing himself, Abba.\" </p> <p>\"What?\" </p> <p>Arshad shrugged. \"I shouted through the car window and told the guy to move on and he says, 'I am gassing myself, leave me alone.' Like that.\"<br></p> <p><br>\"No one gasses himself on my property,\" Mo snapped as he marched downstairs. \"We are not licensed.\"</p> <p>Once in the street, Mo advanced upon Archie's car, pulled out the towels that were sealing the gap in the driver's window, and pushed it down five inches with brute, bullish force. </p> <p>\"Do you hear that, mister? We're not licensed for suicides around here. This place halal. Kosher, understand? If you're going to die round here, my friend, I'm afraid you've got to be thoroughly bled first.\" </p> <p>Archie dragged his head off the steering wheel. And in the moment between focusing on the sweaty bulk of a brown-skinned Elvis and realizing that life was still his, he had a kind of epiphany. It occurred to him that, for the first time since his birth, Life had said Yes to Archie Jones. Not simply an 'OK' or 'You-might-as-well-carry-on-since-you've-started', but a resounding affirmative. Life wanted Archie. She had jealously grabbed him from the jaws of death, back to her bosom. Although he was not one of her better specimens, Life wanted Archie and Archie, much to his own surprise, wanted Life. </p> <p>Frantically, he wound down both his windows and gasped for oxygen from the very depths of his lungs. In between gulps he thanked Mo profusely, tears streaming down his cheeks, his hands clinging on to Mo's apron. </p> <p>\"All right, all right,\" said the butcher, freeing himself from Archie's fingers and brushing himself clean, \"move along now. I've got meat coming. I'm in the business of bleeding. Not counselling. You want Lonely Street. This Cricklewood Lane.\" </p> <p>Archie, still choking on thank yous, reversed, pulled out from the curb, and turned right. </p> <p>~</p> <p>Archie Jones attempted suicide because his wife Ophelia, a violet-eyed Italian with a faint moustache, had recently divorced him. But he had not spent New Year's morning gagging on the tube of a vacuum cleaner because he loved her. It was rather because he had lived with her for so long and had not loved her. Archie's marriage felt like buying a pair of shoes, taking them home and finding they don't fit. For the sake of appearances, he put up with them. And then, all of a sudden and after 30 years, the shoes picked themselves up and walked out of the house. She left. Thirty years. </p> <p>As far as he remembered, just like everybody else they began well. The first spring of 1946, he had stumbled out of the darkness of war and into a Florentine coffee house, where he was served by a waitress truly like the sun: Ophelia Diagilo, dressed all in yellow, spreading warmth and the promise of sex as she passed him a frothy cappuccino. They walked into it blinkered as horses. She was not to know that women never stayed as daylight in Archie's life; that somewhere in him he didn't like them, he didn't trust them, and he was able to love them only if they wore haloes. No one told Archie that lurking in the Diagilo family tree were two hysteric aunts, an uncle who talked to aubergines and a cousin who wore his clothes back to front. So they got married and returned to England, where she realized very quickly her mistake, he drove her very quickly mad, and the halo was packed off to the attic to collect dust with the rest of the bric-a-brac and broken kitchen appliances that Archie promised one day to repair. Amongst that bric-a-brac was a Hoover. </p> <p>On Boxing Day morning, six days before he parked outside Mo's halal butchers, Archie had returned to their semi-detached in Hendon in search of that Hoover. It was his fourth trip to the attic in so many days, ferrying out the odds and ends of a marriage to his new flat, and the Hoover was amongst the very last items he reclaimed - one of the most broken things, most ugly things, the things you demand out of sheer bloody-mindedness because you have lost the house. This is what divorce is: taking things you no longer want from people you no longer love. </p> <p>\"So you again,\" said the Spanish home-help at the door, Santa-Maria or Maria-Santa or something. \"Meester Jones, what now? Kitchen sink, si?\" </p> <p>\"Hoover,\" said Archie, grimly. \"Vacuum.\"</p> <p>She cut her eyes at him and spat on the doormat inches from his shoes. \"Welcome, senor.\" </p> <p>The place had become a haven for people who hated him. Apart from the home-help, he had to contend with Ophelia's extended Italian family, her mental-health nurse, the woman from the council, and of course Ophelia herself, who was to be found in the kernel of this nuthouse, curled up in a foetal ball on the sofa, making lowing sounds into a bottle of Bailey's. It took him an hour and a quarter just to get through enemy lines - and for what? A perverse Hoover, discarded months earlier because it was determined to perform the opposite of every vacuum's objective: spewing out dust instead of sucking it in. </p> <p>\"Meester Jones, why do you come here when it make you so unhappy? Be reasonable. What can you want with it?\" The home-help was following him up the attic stairs, armed with some kind of cleaning fluid: \"It's broken. You don't need this. See? See?\" She plugged it into a socket and demonstrated the dead switch. Archie took the plug out and silently wound the cord round the Hoover. If it was broken, it was coming with him. All broken things were coming with him. He was going to fix every damn broken thing in this house, if only to show that he was good for something. </p> <p>\"You good for nothing!\" Santa whoever chased him back down the stairs .\"Your wife is ill in her head, and this is all you can do!\" </p> <p>Archie hugged the Hoover to his chest and took it into the crowded living room, where, under several pairs of reproachful eyes, he got out his toolbox and started work on it. </p> <p>\"Look at him,\" said one of the Italian grandmothers, the more glamorous one with the big scarves and fewer moles, \"he take everything, capisce? He take-a her mind, he take-a the blender, he take-a the old stereo - he take-a everything except the floorboards. It make-a you sick...\" </p> <p>The woman from the council, who even on dry days resembled a long-haired cat soaked to the skin, shook her skinny head in agreement. \"It's disgusting, you don't have to tell me, it's disgusting... and naturally, we're the ones left to sort out the mess; it's muggins here who has to -\" </p> <p>Which was overlapped by the nurse: \"She can't stay here alone, can she... now he's buggered off, poor woman ... she needs a proper home, she needs...\" <br></p> <p><br>I'm here, Archie felt like saying, I'm right here you know, I'm bloody right here. And it was my blender. </p> <p>But he wasn't one for confrontation, Archie. He listened to them all for another 15 minutes, mute as he tested the Hoover's suction against pieces of newspaper, until he was overcome by the sensation that Life was an enormous rucksack so impossibly heavy that, even though it meant losing everything, it was infinitely easier to leave all baggage here on the roadside and walk on into the blackness. You don't need the blender, Archie-boy, you don't need the Hoover. This stuff's all dead weight. Just lay down the rucksack, Arch, and join the happy campers in the sky. Was that wrong? To Archie - ex-wife and ex-wife's relatives in one ear, spluttering vacuum in the other - it just seemed that The End was unavoidably nigh. Nothing personal to God or whatever. It just felt like the end of the world. And he was going to need more than poor whisky, novelty crackers and a paltry box of Quality Street - all the strawberry ones already scoffed - to justify entering another annum. </p> <p>Patiently he fixed the Hoover, and vacuumed the living room with a strange methodical finality, shoving the nozzle into the most difficult comers. Solemnly he flipped a coin (heads, life, tails, death) and felt nothing in particular when he found himself staring at the dancing lion. Quietly he detached the Hoover tube, put it in a suitcase, and left the house for the last time. </p> <p> Excerpted from <strong>White Teeth</strong> by Zadie Smith Copyright\u00a9 2000 by Zadie Smith.

Amongst that bric-a-brac was a Hoover. On Boxing Day morning, six days before he parked outside Mo's halal butchers, Archie had returned to their semi-detached in Hendon in search of that Hoover. It was his fourth trip to the attic in so many days, ferrying out the odds and ends of a marriage to his new flat, and the Hoover was amongst the very last items he reclaimed - one of the most broken things, most ugly things, the things you demand out of sheer bloody-mindedness because you have lost the house. This is what divorce is: taking things you no longer want from people you no longer love. \"So you again,\" said the Spanish home-help at the door, Santa-Maria or Maria-Santa or something. \"Meester Jones, what now? Kitchen sink, si?\" \"Hoover,\" said Archie, grimly. \"Vacuum.\" She cut her eyes at him and spat on the doormat inches from his shoes. \"Welcome, senor.\" The place had become a haven for people who hated him. Apart from the home-help, he had to contend with Ophelia's extended Italian family, her mental-health nurse, the woman from the council, and of course Ophelia herself, who was to be found in the kernel of this nuthouse, curled up in a foetal ball on the sofa, making lowing sounds into a bottle of Bailey's. It took him an hour and a quarter just to get through enemy lines - and for what? A perverse Hoover, discarded months earlier because it was determined to perform the opposite of every vacuum's objective: spewing out dust instead of sucking it in. \"Meester Jones, why do you come here when it make you so unhappy? Be reasonable. What can you want with it?\" The home-help was following him up the attic stairs, armed with some kind of cleaning fluid: \"It's broken. You don't need this. See? See?\" She plugged it into a socket and demonstrated the dead switch. Archie took the plug out and silently wound the cord round the Hoover. If it was broken, it was coming with him. All broken things were coming with him. He was going to fix every damn broken thing in this house, if only to show that he was good for something. \"You good for nothing!\" Santa whoever chased him back down the stairs .\"Your wife is ill in her head, and this is all you can do!\" Archie hugged the Hoover to his chest and took it into the crowded living room, where, under several pairs of reproachful eyes, he got out his toolbox and started work on it. \"Look at him,\" said one of the Italian grandmothers, the more glamorous one with the big scarves and fewer moles, \"he take everything, capisce? He take-a her mind, he take-a the blender, he take-a the old stereo - he take-a everything except the floorboards. It make-a you sick...\" The woman from the council, who even on dry days resembled a long-haired cat soaked to the skin, shook her skinny head in agreement. \"It's disgusting, you don't have to tell me, it's disgusting... and naturally, we're the ones left to sort out the mess; it's muggins here who has to -\" Which was overlapped by the nurse: \"She can't stay here alone, can she... now he's buggered off, poor woman ... she needs a proper home, she needs...\" I'm here, Archie felt like saying, I'm right here you know, I'm bloody right here. And it was my blender. But he wasn't one for confrontation, Archie. He listened to them all for another 15 minutes, mute as he tested the Hoover's suction against pieces of newspaper, until he was overcome by the sensation that Life was an enormous rucksack so impossibly heavy that, even though it meant losing everything, it was infinitely easier to leave all baggage here on the roadside and walk on into the blackness. You don't need the blender, Archie-boy, you don't need the Hoover. This stuff's all dead weight. Just lay down the rucksack, Arch, and join the happy campers in the sky. Was that wrong? To Archie - ex-wife and ex-wife's relatives in one ear, spluttering vacuum in the other - it just seemed that The End was unavoidably nigh. Nothing personal to God or whatever. It just felt like the end of the world. And he was going to need more than poor whisky, novelty crackers and a paltry box of Quality Street - all the strawberry ones already scoffed - to justify entering another annum. Patiently he fixed the Hoover, and vacuumed the living room with a strange methodical finality, shoving the nozzle into the most difficult comers. Solemnly he flipped a coin (heads, life, tails, death) and felt nothing in particular when he found himself staring at the dancing lion. Quietly he detached the Hoover tube, put it in a suitcase, and left the house for the last time. Excerpted from White Teeth by Zadie Smith Copyright\u00a9 2000 by Zadie Smith.

The Home Secretary added: \"Such an arrangement would not in our judgment assist the protection of children or public safety.\" After their meeting with Mr Straw, the Paynes, from Hersham, Surrey, said they had found common ground in some areas, such as tougher sentences, and had disagreed on others.</p> <p>The Paynes, both 31, handed a 700,000-strong petition backing Sarah's Law to the Home Secretary. Mr Payne said the massive public support for their campaign and the thousands of letters they had received since Sarah was snatched on July 1 after a day on the beach in West Sussex had helped them cope with her death.</p> <p>The petition included more than 700,000 signatures from News of the World readers, gathered since the newspaper started its Sarah's Law campaign.</p> <p>Mr Straw's decision comes despite the campaign spearheaded by the parents of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne, who met the Home Secretary earlier this week.</p> <p>Sara and Michael Payne are pressing for the introduction of a 'Sarah's Law' which would give parents access to the register.</p> <p>However, a package of measures to strengthen the protection of children and provide more information to the public was announced by Mr Straw.</p> <p>The proposals include a new statutory duty on the police and probation services to establish arrangements for assessing and managing the risks posed by all sex offenders and other dangerous offenders released into the community.</p> <p>The home secretary would also be given power to issue guidance on these arrangements to the public. A statutory duty will be placed on the probation service to ask victims or their families if they want to be consulted on the release arrangements for sex and violence offenders sentenced to 12 months or more.</p> <p>Victims or their families could be kept informed of the offender's release arrangements and details of any licence conditions restricting his or her movements.</p> <p>The package also includes proposals to tighten up the operation of the Sex Offenders Register and for a new Sex Offender Restraining Order.</p> <p>Mr Straw said the tragedy of Sarah Payne's death had touched everyone's lives. \"We have, I believe, recognised the very strong public concern which her murder has evoked,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The intention of these measures is to provide stronger safeguards for children and also to reassure the public about risk management of sex offenders in the community through the provision of more information about these arrangements.\"</p> <p>Mr Straw said members of the public will not be given access to the names and addresses of people on the Sex Offenders Register.</p> <p>He explained: \"Controlled disclosure is I believe the better and safer route. Therefore I have concluded that the professional agencies, the police and probation services, are best-placed to determine the disclosure of information on individual sex offenders.</p> <p>\"But I do believe that the public should have a right to know what measures the police and probation services have in place to protect the public.\"</p>",

The Home Secretary added: \"Such an arrangement would not in our judgment assist the protection of children or public safety.\" After their meeting with Mr Straw, the Paynes, from Hersham, Surrey, said they had found common ground in some areas, such as tougher sentences, and had disagreed on others. The Paynes, both 31, handed a 700,000-strong petition backing Sarah's Law to the Home Secretary. Mr Payne said the massive public support for their campaign and the thousands of letters they had received since Sarah was snatched on July 1 after a day on the beach in West Sussex had helped them cope with her death. The petition included more than 700,000 signatures from News of the World readers, gathered since the newspaper started its Sarah's Law campaign. Mr Straw's decision comes despite the campaign spearheaded by the parents of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne, who met the Home Secretary earlier this week. Sara and Michael Payne are pressing for the introduction of a 'Sarah's Law' which would give parents access to the register. However, a package of measures to strengthen the protection of children and provide more information to the public was announced by Mr Straw. The proposals include a new statutory duty on the police and probation services to establish arrangements for assessing and managing the risks posed by all sex offenders and other dangerous offenders released into the community. The home secretary would also be given power to issue guidance on these arrangements to the public. A statutory duty will be placed on the probation service to ask victims or their families if they want to be consulted on the release arrangements for sex and violence offenders sentenced to 12 months or more. Victims or their families could be kept informed of the offender's release arrangements and details of any licence conditions restricting his or her movements. The package also includes proposals to tighten up the operation of the Sex Offenders Register and for a new Sex Offender Restraining Order. Mr Straw said the tragedy of Sarah Payne's death had touched everyone's lives. \"We have, I believe, recognised the very strong public concern which her murder has evoked,\" he said. \"The intention of these measures is to provide stronger safeguards for children and also to reassure the public about risk management of sex offenders in the community through the provision of more information about these arrangements.\" Mr Straw said members of the public will not be given access to the names and addresses of people on the Sex Offenders Register. He explained: \"Controlled disclosure is I believe the better and safer route. Therefore I have concluded that the professional agencies, the police and probation services, are best-placed to determine the disclosure of information on individual sex offenders. \"But I do believe that the public should have a right to know what measures the police and probation services have in place to protect the public.\"",

      "body": "<p>Rotted shark, breast of puffin, sheep's head, ram's testicles, skyr (a cultured milk preparation served as dessert), blood pudding ... Iceland's traditional foods are not for those of a sensitive disposition or delicate stomach. Which might explain why, though you can go to a restaurant in London and order food from just about anywhere else in the world, if you want to eat Icelandic, you really do have to go to Iceland. </p> <p>And despite the climate (averaging 10C in summer, -0.5C in winter; in other words, even more miserable than Britain) and the prices (\u00a36 for a pint of beer, anyone?), going to Iceland is exactly what thousands of young Brits are doing every weekend. On Fridays they catch a flight from Stansted (it is surprisingly cheap, at \u00a3118 with British Airways' budget airline, Go) and head three hours north to a land of lava fields and glaciers, to spend the weekend lazing in geothermally heated pools and exceedingly laid-back nightclubs. But what do they find to eat when they get there? </p> <p>Putrefied shark sounds like the sort of thing you'd only swallow for a bet - and that's even before you learn that freshly caught Greenland shark is poisonous because of its cyanic acid content. But some centuries ago, Icelanders discovered that if they buried the carcass and left it to ferment for a few months it didn't actually kill people when they ate it, hence the now pungent national delicacy. As an island - and a northerly one at that - Iceland has had most of its cuisine dictated by the edibility of the wildlife and the need to preserve it. So fish comes sun-dried (eaten as a snack, or before a meal, torn apart and softened with a little butter); meat is saved every which way it can be; and every part of a beast (and I mean every part) that may plausibly be transformed into some nutritious meal has found its way into the recipe books. </p> <p>Iceland's favourite son, Magnus Magnusson, tells me with relish that whenever he goes home he returns with suitcases heavy with food. \"People laugh at these things, but I love it all,\" he says. \"Especially sheep's head, although I'm afraid that's considered rather infra dig these days. Icelanders are like, 'Oh yeah, sheep's head, we're past that - we don't eat it any more.' But I adore it - the meat around the jaw is marvellous.\" </p> <p>Being in Iceland feels like being on the very cap of the world. The clouds are so low that the gap between sky and earth seems impossibly slender. Even in early September the sea air is harsh and unforgiving. The low-slung houses, all painted red, blue, white and green, seem hastily erected from planks of wood and corrugated iron. The capital, Reykjavik, is so tiny (its population is just 110,000) that virtually wherever you are you can peer down some street to the grey waters of the harbour where the fishing vessels are lined up in front of the fuel tanks. </p> <p>Around the edges of the sea, volcanic cones arch angrily upwards, as if no other land had any business being there. And in front of the cathedral - a huge concrete arrow that looks like something from Star Wars - stands a statue of a proud, armour-clad Norseman: Leifur Eiriksson, an 11th-century navigator and son of Eric the Red, who discovered the coast of America before Christopher Columbus. </p> <p>Against this atavistic backdrop, sheep's head and sharkmeat don't seem so out of place. They are still eaten, and celebrated each February at Thorrablot, the festival of the month of sour things, when Icelanders traditionally feast on preserved foods. Yet like the rest of us, Iceland has succumbed, in part at least, to what has become the bindweed of the kitchen - Italian fast food. This foreign invasion (and yes, there is also a McDonald's in Reykjavik) may be keeping the tourists happy, but this is evidently of great concern to some of the natives. \"Before the recent onslaught of nouvelle cuisine, pizza and pasta,\" froths one recipe book I found, \"Icelanders ate wholesome meals majoring in fish and lamb.\" </p> <p>Some restaurants have tried to compromise by taking the modern European style of cooking and substituting a few local ingredients. This week I dined out on smoked breast of puffin (apparently once a vital part of Icelanders' diets, now considered rather a delicacy) with deep-fried carrots and carpaccio of dolphin with a marinated tomato salad. The puffin meat was very dark - the colour of dried blood - and exceptionally tender, though so thoroughly smoked I could discern no other flavour. The dolphin was also deep-coloured, and tasted a little like very thinly sliced raw beef. </p> <p>There were chewy bits (muscle, presumably) that my teeth couldn't bite through; the rest was tender. The waiter explained that dolphins tend to be tough and must usually be \"boiled and boiled and boiled\" to render them edible. I could not quite believe that I was eating real dolphin (there is a creature called a dolphin fish, but it swims in tropical or semi-tropical waters). Later I was told that it had indeed been \"real\": Icelanders eat the very small dolphins - hrefnakjot - that get caught in fishing nets, \"but perhaps you shouldn't write about that in a British paper. It will not be very popular.\" </p> <p>Still, there was no sign on any menu of the famous rotted shark. The twin receptionists at my hotel launched into a rhapsodic double act when I mentioned it. \"We have it at home all the time,\" they said, smiling. Rotted shark, they continued, is said to be good for the stomach, is usually eaten before a meal to help counteract the effects of the great quantities of alcohol about to be drunk, and is excellent when washed down with Brennvin (a strong local spirit made with herbs) straight from the freezer. The girls suggest that the best place to look for shark is in a shop, rather than on a restaurant menu, and recommend buying the white cuts of meat because they are not as tough as the brown-tinged ones. </p> <p>Eventually, I unearth some plastic tubfuls in the 10-11 (the Icelandic equivalent of a 7-11). It is cut into bite-sized cubes that float in a pungent-smelling transparent liquid. The shark tastes like very fine Gorgonzola - at first. As I slide my teeth through the soft flesh, it becomes rather more fishy and a chemical taste whacks the back of my throat. I'm ashamed to say that I gag. But I do finish it. Perhaps you have to have Norse blood in your veins to appreciate it. Certainly, none of the clubbing British I speak to is able to say they enjoy it. </p> <p>Yet there is one traditional Icelandic food that everyone likes and, indeed, that may soon be on its way to Britain - smoked lamb. I eat it on blackened flatbread as a mid-morning snack. It is perfect Germolene- pink, slicked over with the thinnest layer of fat. Maria Imgibergsdottir, an assistant at the Osta Budin delicatessen on Skolavordustigur, explains that lamb is usually cooked after being smoked over a fire made of wood and sheep's (here she gestures, waggles her half-mast Icelandic fringe, squirms in the backless trainers that would not be out of place in the trendier parts of London and finally whispers the word in embarrassment) \"shit\". In the newer, large-scale factories, she adds, making fires of sheep dung isn't practical and leaves are often used in its place. Icelandic lamb is famously good, and the smoked version (lamb had to be smoked to preserve it after the autumn slaughtering) is, I must say, truly delicious. It isn't exported from Iceland but we may soon be making it here. </p> <p>At the end of this month Magnus Magnusson is to speak at a sheep conference in Shetland, and he hopes to persuade them to make smoked lamb for a niche market. \"Farming is in such a mess they need to find niche markets,\" he says. So lamb smoked over sheep dung could soon be on our menus, though we may have a longer wait before we see British farmers burying sharks in their backyards.</p>",

No, it is not Nasa's latest project but another form of technological wizardry. </p> <p>Kids, haven't we all been there? That search for the perfect skincare products - as elusive as the proverbial pot of gold. Who hasn't rushed out to buy the latest miracle product, only to try it out at home and realise you have just spent \u00a330 on a pot of nicely packaged salad cream? </p> <p>Well, weep no more, skin-worshippers. For 20 years, beauty-savvy Japanese women have been guarding the secret of the SK-II ritual, a skincare routine discovered, rather unusually, by a Japanese monk after a visit to a sake brewery in Kobe. Like all good beauty devotees, the monk insisted on finding out why the sake workers had skin like the backside of a baby and promptly recruited a team of scientists to aid him on his search for enlightenment. This resulted in the magical liquid dubbed \"Pitera\", from which the SK-II ritual and range were born. </p> <p>Comprising facial foaming cloths (\u00a329), facial treatment essence (\u00a345), moisturising fluid (\u00a340), skin refining cream (\u00a355) and facial mask (\u00a340 for six), SK-II is, I personally guarantee, a wash above the rest. I don't know what that Pitera is all about, but never before have I worn a moisturiser that not only made my skin feel like silk (as opposed to a bit of an oil slick) but also gave me a glow. </p> <p>But bear in mind here that with SK-II, beauty is not merely skin deep - it's pocket-deep, too. The whole kit and caboodle will set you back a sniff more than \u00a3200. But, then again, it is noticeably better than the rest of the tat out there. And at last, at last, it has arrived in the UK, exclusively available at Selfridges in London and Manchester. Complexion consultations are carried out in the specially designed SK-II space, replete with glass panels that magically become cloudy to guard one's privacy. And, best of all, we get it before those pesky Americans, ha ha. This really is the biz. </p>",

      "bodyText": "You may have heard the awe-struck whispers and forcibly muted fuss enveloping SK-II this month. No, it is not Nasa's latest project but another form of technological wizardry. Kids, haven't we all been there? That search for the perfect skincare products - as elusive as the proverbial pot of gold. Who hasn't rushed out to buy the latest miracle product, only to try it out at home and realise you have just spent \u00a330 on a pot of nicely packaged salad cream? Well, weep no more, skin-worshippers. For 20 years, beauty-savvy Japanese women have been guarding the secret of the SK-II ritual, a skincare routine discovered, rather unusually, by a Japanese monk after a visit to a sake brewery in Kobe. Like all good beauty devotees, the monk insisted on finding out why the sake workers had skin like the backside of a baby and promptly recruited a team of scientists to aid him on his search for enlightenment. This resulted in the magical liquid dubbed \"Pitera\", from which the SK-II ritual and range were born. Comprising facial foaming cloths (\u00a329), facial treatment essence (\u00a345), moisturising fluid (\u00a340), skin refining cream (\u00a355) and facial mask (\u00a340 for six), SK-II is, I personally guarantee, a wash above the rest. I don't know what that Pitera is all about, but never before have I worn a moisturiser that not only made my skin feel like silk (as opposed to a bit of an oil slick) but also gave me a glow. But bear in mind here that with SK-II, beauty is not merely skin deep - it's pocket-deep, too. The whole kit and caboodle will set you back a sniff more than \u00a3200. But, then again, it is noticeably better than the rest of the tat out there. And at last, at last, it has arrived in the UK, exclusively available at Selfridges in London and Manchester. Complexion consultations are carried out in the specially designed SK-II space, replete with glass panels that magically become cloudy to guard one's privacy. And, best of all, we get it before those pesky Americans, ha ha. This really is the biz.",

      "bodyText": "AltaVista is believed to be laying off around 15% of its workforce today in a bid to move into profitability by next quarter and go ahead with its long-awaited initial public offering. AltaVista chief executive Rod Schrock this week informed employees of the move, but he would not reveal the exact number of redundancies. It is understood that most of the cuts will be made in the divisional headquarters in order to centralise operations. Employees in offices outside San Francisco are expected to be hardest hit. A number of US websites, including Cnet.com and Business 2.0, ran details of the speculation, but AltaVista has yet to confirm the move. AltaVista's UK press office said it was expecting an announcement this afternoon from the US head office, but had no further details at this stage. Earlier this year, AltaVista cut about 40 jobs at its US offices, and it has twice delayed a planned European and US IPO. AltaVista holding company CMGI last week announced it was going through a major restructure and would focus increasing on growth revenue rather than market share.",

      "body": "<p>Two senior executives of Trinity Mirror - including Roger Eastoe, who was in charge of the group's national newspaper titles - are leaving as part of a reshuffle engineered by chief executive Philip Graf. </p> <p>The restructuring has created a new senior post overseeing the group's national and regional titles. </p> <p>The company said the new executive would free Mr Graf to supervise the development of Trinity Mirror's new media business, and to look for further acquisitions. </p> <p>The job has been offered to an as yet unnamed executive with a background in consumer product marketing, Mr Graf said. Mr Eastoe, 49, was a Mirror Group stalwart. He is due to leave at the end of the month, and a group statement said he was pursuing \"a number of business opportunities\". </p> <p>He denied there had been any acrimony: \"I've been at the crease for 25 years and run the nationals for four or five years, and I've had a great time. I was here at the low point for the Mirror Group when we weren't sure there was a business anymore.

      "bodyText": "Two senior executives of Trinity Mirror - including Roger Eastoe, who was in charge of the group's national newspaper titles - are leaving as part of a reshuffle engineered by chief executive Philip Graf. The restructuring has created a new senior post overseeing the group's national and regional titles. The company said the new executive would free Mr Graf to supervise the development of Trinity Mirror's new media business, and to look for further acquisitions. The job has been offered to an as yet unnamed executive with a background in consumer product marketing, Mr Graf said. Mr Eastoe, 49, was a Mirror Group stalwart. He is due to leave at the end of the month, and a group statement said he was pursuing \"a number of business opportunities\". He denied there had been any acrimony: \"I've been at the crease for 25 years and run the nationals for four or five years, and I've had a great time. I was here at the low point for the Mirror Group when we weren't sure there was a business anymore. I am moving on now, but the business is in good shape.\" Mike Masters, the other executive on his way out, was group managing director publishing and will retire at the end of the year. Mr Graf said Trinity Mirror's immediate focus would be to pursue further acquisitions in the regional press, although he conceded the group was reluctant to engage in a bidding war for Regional Independent Media.

Jill Treanor Business Senior executives last night were keeping their fingers crossed that the fuel blockade would be lifted completely as industry leaders warned that the crisis would cost business more than \u00a31bn. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said it would take weeks for companies to resume pre-crisis levels of operation while the London Chamber of Commerce believed things were likely to get worse before they got better. A Chamber spokesman added: \"At least \u00a31bn will have gone in lost output but it is still going to be a long process getting businesses back to where they were.\" The CBI said it was difficult to quantify the exact scale of the problem but believed \"hundreds of millions of pounds\" would have been lost.

Much depended now whether tankers could supply businesses as well as emergency services. The UK Steel Association said there was guarded optimism causing some members to postpone plans for winding down production lines. But some shifts had already been cut and output scaled back according to David Rae, the organisation's secretary general. Terry Macalister Schools and local services Hundreds of schools that have managed to keep going during this week's fuel crisis may be forced to shut next week unless teachers are among those given priority access to the petrol now being delivered to designated petrol stations. As thousands of schoolchildren were told to stay away from classes yesterday education officials warned that teaching staff in some rural areas were finding it increasingly difficult to get to work. Somerset county council, which has kept all its school open, said heads would make a decision today on whether to reopen on Monday. A spokesman said the authority was concerned that unless teachers were able to get petrol schools across the county would be hit next week. In Rhondda Cynon Taff only one of the county's 19 secondary schools was able to open yesterday forcing 19,000 children to miss lessons. The schools will remain closed today. The council has warned that the problem could spill over beyond the weekend, possibly affecting primary school children as well. Devon said none of its schools had had to close. But 47 of the 950 school bus services have already ground to a halt. More are expected to be hit today. In Birmingham more than 370 children were affected after two schools closed because of the fuel shortages, while in Bolton up to 100 special needs pupils were unable to get to classes after buses on five routes were cancelled. In County Durham, where schools remained open yesterday, the council said it did not anticipate any problems before the end of the week. Geoffrey Gibbs Public transport Fuel deliveries reached selected train and bus depots yesterday after some London services ground to a halt, but operators warned that buses would not be back to normal for a week and London cabs were coming off the road. A spokesman for the mayor's fuel emergency team in London, which yesterday appealed directly to fuel suppliers, said Brentford and Dagenham bus depots received fuel last night after drying up. But 60% of First Capital's east London services had been cut and three London bus companies cancelled services because drivers could not get to work. Stagecoach spokesman Barry Gardner said that although fuel tankers had reached critical depots in Oxford, Gloucestershire and Lancashire and fuel was expected in Wales, services would suffer cancellations after 7pm. These measures could stay in place until next week. In the north-west, the bus operator Arriva said it had enough fuel to run normal services until tonight. Sunday services were still operating in Blackpool, and in Nottingham and Bristol evening services remained reduced. A Transport for London spokeswoman said the capital's taxi situation was getting \"progressively worse\" as independent drivers came off the road and fleets with diesel reserves prioritised getting London underground staff to work. The Association of Train Operating Companies was optimistic that train companies had enough fuel to run normally for the next six days. Anglia resumed cancelled services yesterday but selected South West services from Exeter and Brighton South West remained cancelled until fuel arrived. Angelique Chrisafis",

The general union GMB said the figures, showing that nine executives at BP Amoco and Shell received rises of at least 35% last year, exposed new levels of \"greed\". Its general secretary, John Edmonds, said: \"It is a scandal that these directors are making huge profits by milking the country dry.\" The top pay rise at BP Amoco was 65%, while at Shell it was 58%, according to the research. It also showed the pay of the highest earning director at Elf Petroleum increased from \u00a3415,000 to \u00a3640,000 last year, while at Esso it rose from \u00a3474,000 to \u00a3495,000, at Totalfina it went from \u00a3192,000 to \u00a3268,000 and from \u00a3461,000 to \u00a3474,000 at Texaco. Mr Edmonds said: \"This exposes the insatiable greed of the oil guzzling gluttons. \"Taxpayers should ask themselves whether they really want to see tax revenues pumped into the coffers of the fattest cats in the corporate jungle or whether they would rather see money invested in vital public services.\" The fuel crisis will have cost businesses \u00a31bn - the equivalent of \u00a340 per household - by the time it has ended, the Institute of Directors (IoD) warned separately today. The overall loss of output would be about \u00a31bn on the assumption that it would take two to three weeks for the crisis to be fully resolved, and that disruption to the economy would be about 5% of activity in the first week and rapidly declined after that, the IoD said. The hotel and tourism industries, retail and manufacturing are all particularly vulnerable, while agriculture and businesses in rural areas are also likely to be disrupted, it warned. And, almost as a direct response to that warning, British Airways announced today it had raised fares by three percent as a result of high fuel prices. A spokeswoman for Europe's largest airline said the rise had taken place with effect from today and covered all published tariffs except current promotional fares. It came after KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which is in merger talks with British Airways, had also announced a four percent fare rise. The IoD said the fuel crisis could also be the final straw for small businesses. Its policy unit head, Ruth Lea, said: \"Limited as the economic damage is, some marginal businesses will inevitably be finished by the fuel crisis. \"The protesters are right to complain about the extortionately high fuel duties and we look to the chancellor to cut them in his next Budget.\" The IoD warning came as two protesters, arrested during the recent fuel crisis, appeared in court in Sunderland. Farmer Andrew Spence, 33, of Medomsley, County Durham, was one of the main organisers of the fuel pickets at Jarrow and Sunderland in the north-east of England. He and fellow picketer, farmer Rob Muir, 34, of Consett, County Durham, were both accused of obstructing the highway after attempting to block the path of a tanker at the fuel terminal at Sunderland docks on Wednesday.

He told delegates: \"I suppose we should be congratulating him. He once said he promised to reduce the number of cars on the road - and that's precisely what he's done. Well done!\" Britain spent today struggling to get back to normal as petrol stations began restocking with fuel after protesters lifted the week-long pickets and demonstrations which had stopped supplies leaving refineries. Many garages and service stations across the country were still only supplying the emergency services, while others with petrol available were being forced to ration motorists to \u00a310 of fuel each. Tensions boiled over at many petrol stations as long queues meant motorists had to wait, in some cases for up to two hours for their \u00a310 worth. But as the end of the crisis neared, traffic was gradually getting heavier in many parts of the country. An AA Roadwatch spokesman said: \"Many of the garages are still empty or closed, but people are starting to queue at stations despite their 'no fuel' signs because they are believing what they hear - that things are getting back to normal. \"Things are getting better and there are efforts to get back to normal, but there are stations still having to prioritise and ration.\" Motorway services were expecting deliveries this morning, including the London Gateway on the M25 and the M1 Toddington services. The M1 Watford Gap services reopened this morning with both unleaded and diesel supplies, but there were long queues for diesel. Meanwhile, a handful of protesters remained at BP's Grangemouth refinery in central Scotland. But the prime minister, Tony Blair, warned the crisis was not over yet, as protesters vowed to take action again if the tax on fuel is not cut in 60 days. The NHS remained on red alert today, and supermarkets appealed for an end to panic buying after nervous shoppers cleared shelves of essentials such as bread and milk. Postal services have been slashed by the Post Office as stocks of fuel for its 36,000 vehicles came close to running out, and more than 70 schools were closed. It later emerged that more than 100 fuel protesters spent the night at the showground outside Carmarthen. They are due to discuss whether to take further action later today as they said they still felt the need to take some action.",

      "body": "<p>As petrol station across Britain struggled to get back to normal today, chancellor Gordon Brown, dug in his heels against any early tax concessions on fuel prices before next March, despite a 60 day deadline for action imposed by pickets when they lifted their crippling blockades.</p> <p>With Tony Blair's full support, Mr Brown let it be known that he will not be deflected by what ministers insist are \"illegal blockades and intimidation\" in reaching his budget judgment as usual in March. Downing Street believes its firm stance will win round public opinion as tempers cool.</p> <p>A senior No 10 official said: \"These people have got to take on board the facts of the budget process. You cannot make budget decisions as a response to protests. There is a budget process and a parallel democratic process. They can make representations if they wish.\"</p> <p>However, the government's strategy is high risk given the scale of action and strength of feeling shown this week. Protesters - who include farmers, hauliers and fishermen, already aggrieved at what they see as unfair treatment by the government - have threatened to reimpose blockades of oil refineries and depots if there is no move to cut fuel taxes.</p> <p>During another day of drama which saw Esso, impose a provocative 2p-4p a litre increase - only to withdraw it within four hours after a meeting with Mr Blair - ministers breathed a collective sign of relief as the worst crisis of their government began to wind down.</p> <p>It is expected that by 3pm tomorrow, many garages will be restocked, though a \u00a310 limit of petrol per motorist may be implemented. Some motorway service stations are already re-stocked, though there are queues of up to two miles long for the fuel.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the NHS remained on red alert today, and supermarkets appealed for an end to panic buying after nervous shoppers cleared shelves of essentials such as bread and milk.</p> <p>Postal services have been reduced to just one collection and delivery a day by the Post Office as stocks of fuel for its 36,000 vehicles came close to running out, and more than 70 schools across Britain were closed.</p> <p>Jack Straw, the home secretary, will head a joint team with the industry to ensure there is no repetition of this week's rapid crisis, though Blair aides are confident the threat to restore pickets if no concessions are made by mid-November will not materialise.</p> <p>Angry pickets voted throughout yesterday to end the crisis and claimed a \"a great moral victory\", though pockets of resistance continued. When Esso announced its increase to protect profit margins some pickets threatened to restore their blockades and motoring organisations called the increase \"insensitive\".</p> <p>Though Mr Blair rejected calls for an Office of Fair Trading investigation of the oil firms Stephen Byers, the trade secretary, may yet decide to instigate one. Most of the companies - making record global profits, it emerged yesterday - promised to absorb any losses from the blockades.</p> <p>The prime minister's anger over yesterday's short-lived fuel price rise was evident at the press conference. \"I cannot really understand that Esso decision. The world oil price, as far as I'm aware, has actually come down in the last few days.\" He repeated the message in private to industry leaders. Despite speculation that he will cut vehicle excise duty for lorries or reduce taxes on petrol Mr Brown, whose annual pre-budget report is due in mid-November, is adamant that he will not be bounced. Mr Blair told reporters the government is willing to listen, and to meet groups with \"genuine and sincerely held grievances\".</p> <p>But \"to lurch into some short-term fix with emergency budgets and the like would not just be irresponsible, but the effect on the country's financial standing and credibility would be immediate and catastrophic\", he insisted.</p> <p>In a downbeat assessment Mr Blair warned that \"lives have been and are still at risk\". He admitted that mistakes had been made and appealed to voters to \"carefully reflect on recent events. However much people may dislike paying petrol duty there's no way that any government of this country could or should yield to this form of protest\".</p> <p>After regaining control of their worst spontaneous crisis yet, ministers are gambling on rallying public opinion and on western efforts to persuade Opec, the oil producers cartel, to increase production and cut prices - a move which may damage the government's green credentials. Despite savage attacks by William Hague and his allies in the Conservative press - the government had itself provoked this \"taxpayers' revolt\" the Tory leader said - Mr Blair has been comforted by the \"extraordinary unity\" among Labour supporters and unions.</p> <p>Government sources said the crisis was turned round at a crucial stage by senior Transport and General Workers union officials persuading members in the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland to break the blockade in a convoy.</p> <p>The deal, relayed to protesters around 2am yesterday, persuaded pickets ouside the refinery that it would be better to retreat in an orderly way while still claiming the high moral ground. At the same time, protesters at the Stanlow refinery in Cheshire - where the action started more than a week ago - also decided to abandon their blockade while they still had public support.</p> <p>Privately ministers believe they can persuade voters that tough decisions on public spending - including petrol taxes - are crucial to a buoyant economy which in turn funds improved health and education.</p> <p>Mr Hague gave notice that Alan Milburn's declaration of an NHS red alert will be investigated.</p> <p>\"The most disgraceful spinning of the crisis came from the health secretary - and we will be examining very carefully what he said and did this week,\" he said last night.</p> <p>t.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As petrol station across Britain struggled to get back to normal today, chancellor Gordon Brown, dug in his heels against any early tax concessions on fuel prices before next March, despite a 60 day deadline for action imposed by pickets when they lifted their crippling blockades. With Tony Blair's full support, Mr Brown let it be known that he will not be deflected by what ministers insist are \"illegal blockades and intimidation\" in reaching his budget judgment as usual in March. Downing Street believes its firm stance will win round public opinion as tempers cool. A senior No 10 official said: \"These people have got to take on board the facts of the budget process. You cannot make budget decisions as a response to protests. There is a budget process and a parallel democratic process. They can make representations if they wish.\" However, the government's strategy is high risk given the scale of action and strength of feeling shown this week. Protesters - who include farmers, hauliers and fishermen, already aggrieved at what they see as unfair treatment by the government - have threatened to reimpose blockades of oil refineries and depots if there is no move to cut fuel taxes. During another day of drama which saw Esso, impose a provocative 2p-4p a litre increase - only to withdraw it within four hours after a meeting with Mr Blair - ministers breathed a collective sign of relief as the worst crisis of their government began to wind down. It is expected that by 3pm tomorrow, many garages will be restocked, though a \u00a310 limit of petrol per motorist may be implemented. Some motorway service stations are already re-stocked, though there are queues of up to two miles long for the fuel. Meanwhile, the NHS remained on red alert today, and supermarkets appealed for an end to panic buying after nervous shoppers cleared shelves of essentials such as bread and milk. Postal services have been reduced to just one collection and delivery a day by the Post Office as stocks of fuel for its 36,000 vehicles came close to running out, and more than 70 schools across Britain were closed. Jack Straw, the home secretary, will head a joint team with the industry to ensure there is no repetition of this week's rapid crisis, though Blair aides are confident the threat to restore pickets if no concessions are made by mid-November will not materialise. Angry pickets voted throughout yesterday to end the crisis and claimed a \"a great moral victory\", though pockets of resistance continued. When Esso announced its increase to protect profit margins some pickets threatened to restore their blockades and motoring organisations called the increase \"insensitive\". Though Mr Blair rejected calls for an Office of Fair Trading investigation of the oil firms Stephen Byers, the trade secretary, may yet decide to instigate one. Most of the companies - making record global profits, it emerged yesterday - promised to absorb any losses from the blockades. The prime minister's anger over yesterday's short-lived fuel price rise was evident at the press conference. \"I cannot really understand that Esso decision. The world oil price, as far as I'm aware, has actually come down in the last few days.\" He repeated the message in private to industry leaders. Despite speculation that he will cut vehicle excise duty for lorries or reduce taxes on petrol Mr Brown, whose annual pre-budget report is due in mid-November, is adamant that he will not be bounced. Mr Blair told reporters the government is willing to listen, and to meet groups with \"genuine and sincerely held grievances\". But \"to lurch into some short-term fix with emergency budgets and the like would not just be irresponsible, but the effect on the country's financial standing and credibility would be immediate and catastrophic\", he insisted. In a downbeat assessment Mr Blair warned that \"lives have been and are still at risk\". He admitted that mistakes had been made and appealed to voters to \"carefully reflect on recent events. However much people may dislike paying petrol duty there's no way that any government of this country could or should yield to this form of protest\". After regaining control of their worst spontaneous crisis yet, ministers are gambling on rallying public opinion and on western efforts to persuade Opec, the oil producers cartel, to increase production and cut prices - a move which may damage the government's green credentials. Despite savage attacks by William Hague and his allies in the Conservative press - the government had itself provoked this \"taxpayers' revolt\" the Tory leader said - Mr Blair has been comforted by the \"extraordinary unity\" among Labour supporters and unions. Government sources said the crisis was turned round at a crucial stage by senior Transport and General Workers union officials persuading members in the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland to break the blockade in a convoy. The deal, relayed to protesters around 2am yesterday, persuaded pickets ouside the refinery that it would be better to retreat in an orderly way while still claiming the high moral ground. At the same time, protesters at the Stanlow refinery in Cheshire - where the action started more than a week ago - also decided to abandon their blockade while they still had public support. Privately ministers believe they can persuade voters that tough decisions on public spending - including petrol taxes - are crucial to a buoyant economy which in turn funds improved health and education. Mr Hague gave notice that Alan Milburn's declaration of an NHS red alert will be investigated. \"The most disgraceful spinning of the crisis came from the health secretary - and we will be examining very carefully what he said and did this week,\" he said last night. t.",

They wanted to see if other groups had come to the same conclusion - that they should end the protest while the public were still on their side.</p> <p>It was just less than a week ago that the very same people - along with Brynle Williams, another militant farmer - led a convoy of 150 farmers and hauliers from a cattle market in St Asaph near Rhyl to Stanlow, targeting it because it is Britain's largest oil refinery. The action was a spur of the moment decision, a whim that ground Britain to a halt. The blockade began at Stanlow last Thursday night and the protesters decided that that is where it should end.</p> <p>After concerns were raised about the health service being put on red alert and an awareness that food stocks would be badly affected by today, leaders decided enough was enough. They had made their point. Each of the men standing on the picket line outside had been consulted in little groups by key members of what they had come to call \"the people's cabinet\". \"It was spread like a Chinese whisper,\" said one.

We have a just cause.\"</p> <p>Standing in the smirry rain, Clive Swan, a farmer and key player, said they could have gone \"on and on\". \"I am gutted. Everybody's gutted and saddened,\" he said. \"We were saying that the protest at this gate had to be brought to a close. We felt we did not want it to turn ugly over the weekend by the wrong people for the wrong reasons and we averted that. It was just a perception that we had that extremists would turn up, that they would infiltrate and steer it to their way of thinking. This campaign is now handed over to the British public.\"</p> <p>Mr Houghton, who said the talks within the office went on without a break, said: \"We were getting the feeling that people were starting to get real hardship. We are family men and women and we have just got to draw the line at the end of the day.

What he didn't realise is that these are educated businessmen and shrewd.\"</p> <p>Although it was finished, some protesters hung around, angry that it had all collapsed. But most drifted away, for breakfast, a good wash and a sleep.

Did companies instruct drivers to take out their tankers? Drivers appear to have been requested rather than instructed to go on their rounds, effectively giving many the option of not driving past the demonstrators.

Despite Mr Blair's repeated refusal to bow to intimidation by small unrepresentative groups, many Labour MPs are certain that concessions will have to be made inside the 60-day deadline imposed by truckers.</p> <p>That will be a crucial test for the chancellor. As with the single parent benefit revolt in 1997 and this year's 75p increase in the basic pension, plenty of MPs will be whispering that Mr Brown is too powerful and too inflexible for the government's own good. \"Tony should rein him in,\" they will say again.</p> <p>The arrogance charge - rejected yesterday by Mr Blair - is more dangerous when tied to William Hague's \"stealth tax\" jibe. The prime minister, chancellor and their colleagues have done their best to explain that world prices are the main culprit and that the extra petrol taxes they imposed in 1997-99 were of Tory origin, caused by the Tory debts they had to clear.</p> <p>Last March's decision to scrap the fuel escalator inherited from the Tories, and used during Labour's early years, has been cited as evidence that the government is listening. The argument has convinced few voters.</p> <p>The Downing Street machine has sought scapegoats: the pickets, the police, and the Opec oil producers. It has also resorted to shroud waving, getting the health secretary, Alan Milburn, to put the NHS into the firing line. The tabloids will attack him for playing politics with the sick. But it worked. Along with the prospect that the army would be sent in the risk of pickets being blamed for deaths helped tip them - and the tabloids - away from further confrontation.</p> <p>Yet ministers persistently refused to go to war, at least in public, with the major oil companies, the one obvious scapegoat whose foot dragging, self-interested tactics could have united pickets, public and ministers against them. Yesterday's own goal by Esso in raising prices before performing a swift U-turn showed what scope was there.</p> <p>Downing Street optimists hope that once voters have reflected on the dispute they will turn against small groups of politically motivated pickets with a vocally anti-Labour agenda.</p> <p>There is even some hope that the crisis will help make voters less car dependent as they discover the joys of fast-moving buses, bikes and unpolluted pavements. But they are almost certainly being over-optimistic.</p> <p>Demonstrators tapped into public resentment against the highest petrol prices in Europe when Britain has North Sea oil.</p> <p>By backing down yesterday before causing the widespread disruption just round the corner, they deprived Mr Blair of the great victory some in No 10 hoped he could achieve.</p>",

A senior Downing Street official, asked if the government would be adopting a \"triumphalist\" tone, wryly conceded: \"I cannot imagine this has helped the government's standing.\" The tone of the prime minister's third No 10 press conference in as many days was distinctly contrite after such a narrow escape. Mr Blair insisted his policies were right, but admitted he had been caught on the hop. Lessons will be learned about crisis management - and about monitoring disputes before they become crises. The more fundamental question is whether it has done long-term harm to new Labour's hard won reputation for competent economic management, or whether the crisis headlines will evaporate almost as quickly as the crisis itself developed last weekend. The short-term damage to Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and John Prescott - and lesser ministers in the crossfire - is obvious. As Mr Blair admitted, they were caught unaware by the speed of the blockades' impact on a \"just in time\" society whose petrol stations and supermarkets hold just enough stock to get by for a day or so. In the first misjudgment, Downing Street and other Whitehall departments thought the protests would fade away rather than spread when they started at the end of last week. Mr Blair realised there was a serious problem only on Monday night when demonstrators blocked his way to a Chinese restaurant in Hull for dinner with Mr Prescott. The following day he pulled out of a regional tour and trip to the TUC in Glasgow to return to the Downing Street bunker. Britain was running out of fuel and heading for a shutdown potentially more disastrous than the winter of discontent or the three-day week during Edward Heath's era. Only on Wednesday did it finally appear as if the government was getting to grips with the crisis as Mr Blair summoned oil industry executives to read the riot act to the global corporations accused of colluding with the demonstrators. It has been a bad week for government dignity in a year when it has been battered by events as disparate as asylum seekers, NHS cash, leaked Blair memos, cashpoint fines and Euan Blair's GCSE celebrations. The only upside of the fuel crisis is that it has distracted public attention from the tottering Greenwich dome.

That will be a crucial test for the chancellor. As with the single parent benefit revolt in 1997 and this year's 75p increase in the basic pension, plenty of MPs will be whispering that Mr Brown is too powerful and too inflexible for the government's own good. \"Tony should rein him in,\" they will say again. The arrogance charge - rejected yesterday by Mr Blair - is more dangerous when tied to William Hague's \"stealth tax\" jibe. The prime minister, chancellor and their colleagues have done their best to explain that world prices are the main culprit and that the extra petrol taxes they imposed in 1997-99 were of Tory origin, caused by the Tory debts they had to clear. Last March's decision to scrap the fuel escalator inherited from the Tories, and used during Labour's early years, has been cited as evidence that the government is listening. The argument has convinced few voters. The Downing Street machine has sought scapegoats: the pickets, the police, and the Opec oil producers. It has also resorted to shroud waving, getting the health secretary, Alan Milburn, to put the NHS into the firing line. The tabloids will attack him for playing politics with the sick. But it worked. Along with the prospect that the army would be sent in the risk of pickets being blamed for deaths helped tip them - and the tabloids - away from further confrontation. Yet ministers persistently refused to go to war, at least in public, with the major oil companies, the one obvious scapegoat whose foot dragging, self-interested tactics could have united pickets, public and ministers against them. Yesterday's own goal by Esso in raising prices before performing a swift U-turn showed what scope was there. Downing Street optimists hope that once voters have reflected on the dispute they will turn against small groups of politically motivated pickets with a vocally anti-Labour agenda. There is even some hope that the crisis will help make voters less car dependent as they discover the joys of fast-moving buses, bikes and unpolluted pavements. But they are almost certainly being over-optimistic. Demonstrators tapped into public resentment against the highest petrol prices in Europe when Britain has North Sea oil. By backing down yesterday before causing the widespread disruption just round the corner, they deprived Mr Blair of the great victory some in No 10 hoped he could achieve.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair beware: despite winding up France's fuel price protest to the satisfaction of most of those involved, the French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, has just seen his popularity take the biggest month-on-month knock ever recorded for a French prime minister. Two different opinion polls, taken at the height of the protest towards the end of last week, show the socialist prime minister's approval rating has plummeted by between 18 and 20 percentage points from the record average of around 60% he has enjoyed since taking office three years ago. \"We're not used to blows like this,\" said a Socialist party source. \"When you've got the impression you've handled a crisis positively, not let the situation go seriously bad on you, shown you can negotiate, avoided the use of force, you might not expect congratulations but you don't expect this kind of slapdown.\" By French standards, it was indeed a crisis well handled: although taken by surprise by the scale of the protest, and appearing uncertain at first, the French government listened to the hauliers, farmers, taxi drivers and others, offered each group some - but not too much - relief, and then sat out a brief storm when they asked for more. Whether British public opinion will feel Mr Blair has been as receptive remains to be seen. If not, he may be even more severely judged. But equally worryingly for the British prime minister, French pollsters say the dramatic collapse in Mr Jospin's popularity was due not so much to the way he handled the crisis as to the fact that it happened at all. According to Stephane Roz\u00e8s of the polling agency CSA Opinion, which carried out a separate survey suggesting some 88% of the French population backed the protesters, the extraordinary popularity of the blockade - and the negative verdict against Mr Jospin - were a protest by proxy. \"People were saying, we don't fancy a future with sky-high pump prices either,\" Mr Roz\u00e8s said. \"They identified with the professionals taking the protest action, made a clear connection with them through the price of fuel. They expect the government to do something to help.\" A Socialist party analyst, Henri Weber, agreed. \"At a time when the French are expecting to benefit from the fruits of three years of solid economic growth, they find themselves facing the third global oil crisis,\" he said. \"It's understandable.

But the high pump prices seem simply to have acted as a lightning rod for a widespread feeling of discontent that the proceeds of France's economic boom have not so far reached the average French person's pocket. Mr Jospin is now urgently consulting his advisers about ways to calm the anger and allow the French as a whole to feel they are benefiting from the economic upturn, either by announcing lower fuel prices through a cut in state fuel taxes of by some other compensatory tax mechanism. Judging by the French opinion polls, Mr Blair may want to do the same.",

The new rules, which are legally binding, will come into force in November and will be buttressed by staff training though, according to Mr Kinnock, this will not include American-style \"how to smile\" courses. The general public will be able to see what is expected of officials by consulting a glossy brochure and a complaints officer will be appointed in each of the commission's 20 departments. If a member of the public feels they have been seriously mistreated they have the option, for the first time, to take the EC or an individual official to the Luxembourg-based European court of justice. The only alternative up to now was to draft a letter of complaint to one central EU ombudsman who could pursue the matter and \"a code of good behaviour\" simply did not exist. The EC receives thousands of telephone calls and enquiries each week and Brussels is heaving with lobbyists and interest groups whose stock in trade is to extract information from officials and influence decision-making.

Ms Humphreys, who had anorexia and was addicted to drugs originally prescribed to her in prison, was found dead at her London home in July 1998. An inquest, reopened at St Pancras coroner's court in London yesterday, heard she weighed just five stone and had 20 times the recommended dose of chloral hydrate in her blood at her death. The jury unanimously found Ms Humphreys, 30, from Upper Holloway, north London, died of trichloroethanol poisoning and returned a verdict of death by misadventure. But after the verdict the campaign group Justice for Women revealed it would be filing a complaint about one of her doctors to the GMC. Spokeswoman Julie Bindel said: \"Because information was censored by the coroner in the inquest, we have been forced to put a complaint about Dr Mayur Gor to the GMC. We were allowed to hold the inquest in front of a jury because the circumstances surrounding Emma's death are of public interest.\" Dr Gor, who was Ms Humphreys's GP after her release from prison in 1995 until her death, told the inquest he had tried to prescribe alternative medication. The inquest heard there were times when the weekly therapeutic dose of 200mls was issued twice within seven days. But the GP said he had given his patient two weeks' worth of the drug in one prescription because he was led to believe that she was going to be away on holiday for that period. Ms Humphreys had also been prescribed chloral hydrate by other GPs in the same north London practice as Dr Gor in the period before her death, the inquest heard. Ms Humphreys was jailed for life for murder in February 1985 at Nottingham crown court after stabbing her boyfriend, Trevor Armitage, to death when she was 17. She claimed Mr Armitage, whom she met when she worked as a prostitute, beat her, forced her to have sex with him and was verbally abusive. She was freed from Holloway prison after 10 years in jail when her conviction was reduced by the appeal court to manslaughter on the grounds of long-term provocation. The decision was hailed as a landmark and set a precedent for women who had killed abusive partners.",

Analysts said that while the price of the deal appeared high, with Content being valued at almost 40 times its annual sales, Baltimore shares trade on an even higher multiple and it could afford to issue the new shares at this level. Shares in Baltimore fell 12p to 760p. Mr Guyatt, chief executive of Content, said joining forces with Baltimore would enable it to roll out new products faster and give it access to a wider customer base. Paul Sanders, group finance director at SSL International, will become chief financial officer in November. The 36-year-old's experience in making strategic acquisitions suggests that Baltimore will pursue further deals. His appointment follows Tuesday's resignation of the chairman, Henry Becker, who has left to devote more time to a project to give every school child in Britain a laptop computer. Deputy chairman Peter Morgan has been promoted to take his place.",

The frustration of the protesters - who were armed with petrol bombs and sharpened bamboo spears - was compounded by another delay in the proceedings: judges inside the heavily guarded agriculture ministry complex being used for the trial ordered an independent medical examination of the ailing defendant and set the next session for September 28. After several hours of medical evidence by Mr Suharto's doctors and prosecution experts, the judges said they had yet to be convinced by defence lawyers' claims that their client was too ill to attend. \"In order to get a conclusive answer as to the state of his health, the defendant should undergo a comprehensive medical examination by an independent team,\" the chief judge, Lalu Mariyun, ordered. This team is to comprise doctors from three universities, the department of health and the Indonesian Doctors' Association. Its members will examine Mr Suharto, 79, and report back to the judges within two weeks. \"If he is considered healthy enough, then he must appear,\" Judge Mariyun said. The Suharto family and its friends are suspected of looting the country's wealth on a grand scale, but the present case is focusing on Mr Suharto and seven charitable foundations he controlled. The retired general - who ruled with an iron fist for 32 years until anti-regime riots forced him to step down in May 1998 - is charged with embezzling about \u00a3400m through the foundations, and taking the proceeds of special taxes he imposed on the profits of state firms. Yesterday was the second session of the slow-moving trial process. At it, Mr Suharto's doctors used slides of brain scans to argue that the stress of court appearances could kill him. \"He has had three strokes in the last two years and there is a large threat of another stroke,\" which would be fatal, Dr Teguh Ranahkusuma said.

The network has been funded to the tune of \u00a31.25bn by BT, US carrier AT&amp;T and Concert, the joint venture between the two. They aim to build 44 centres to give their large multinational customers worldwide access to integrated web hosting and application service provision (ASP). Internet hosting is one of the telecoms sector's fastest growing markets as businesses' internet demands become more sophisticated and they increasingly look to rent software over the net rather than install it in their computers. Analysts say web hosting has become a vogue area among investors, so many believe BT will look to crystallise the value of the venture and reduce debt by eventually floating off Ignite. \"It's being looked at now but nothing has been ruled in and nothing has been ruled out,\" admitted Ignite's Keith Langridge. BT refuses to give details of how much of Ignite's \u00a31.25bn funding it is providing or what its shareholding in the venture is.

      "body": "<p>John Lewis Partnership yesterday warned its 50,000 employee partners that their bonuses would be lower this year because of a \"sharp\" decline in profits. </p> <p>However the retailer, which last year fended off rebel partners who wanted to shake up its ownership structure, revealed that some of the partners are in line to share in a \u00a36m windfall under an accrued holiday pay scheme. </p> <p>Its profits slumped by 43% in the first half of the year - in part because of the four-year, \u00a380m refurbishment of its flagship Peter Jones store in Sloane Square, London. </p> <p>The interim profits were also knocked to \u00a338.5m because of the costs associated with incorporating 11 Somerfield stores into its Waitrose food chain as well as the \u00a36m cost of accrued holiday pay. </p> <p>The boost to partner's pay dates back to an industry-wide arrangement in place until June 1986 under which non-managers received unpaid holiday leave in their first year. </p> <p>Under the terms of the deal, non-managers received the year's holiday pay on their retirement at the rate of pay they received during their final year with the company. </p> <p>Now they will be able to choose to take the payment before reaching retirement. </p> <p>Sir Stuart Hampson, chairman of the partnership, acknowledged the steep decline in profits was a \"serious set-back\" and a reflection of the \"pincer grip\" of falling prices to consumers and a rise in the group's cost base. He said it was now a \"fact of life\" that price rises could not be passed on to customers - which helped explain why an 8.3% rise in sales in the department stores had failed to feed through to higher profits. </p> <p>The stores are now looking at extending their trading hours, and will will also maintain their price pledge - \"never knowingly undersold\" - to purchases on the net. </p> <p>\"Realistically, we must expect our full-year profits to fall way short of those of 1999,\" Sir Stuart said. The implications are clear. With 20 weeks ahead of us it's a matter of partners playing their part to win sales and to keep control of costs so that we bring home the best result we can.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Lewis Partnership yesterday warned its 50,000 employee partners that their bonuses would be lower this year because of a \"sharp\" decline in profits. However the retailer, which last year fended off rebel partners who wanted to shake up its ownership structure, revealed that some of the partners are in line to share in a \u00a36m windfall under an accrued holiday pay scheme. Its profits slumped by 43% in the first half of the year - in part because of the four-year, \u00a380m refurbishment of its flagship Peter Jones store in Sloane Square, London. The interim profits were also knocked to \u00a338.5m because of the costs associated with incorporating 11 Somerfield stores into its Waitrose food chain as well as the \u00a36m cost of accrued holiday pay. The boost to partner's pay dates back to an industry-wide arrangement in place until June 1986 under which non-managers received unpaid holiday leave in their first year. Under the terms of the deal, non-managers received the year's holiday pay on their retirement at the rate of pay they received during their final year with the company. Now they will be able to choose to take the payment before reaching retirement. Sir Stuart Hampson, chairman of the partnership, acknowledged the steep decline in profits was a \"serious set-back\" and a reflection of the \"pincer grip\" of falling prices to consumers and a rise in the group's cost base. He said it was now a \"fact of life\" that price rises could not be passed on to customers - which helped explain why an 8.3% rise in sales in the department stores had failed to feed through to higher profits. The stores are now looking at extending their trading hours, and will will also maintain their price pledge - \"never knowingly undersold\" - to purchases on the net. \"Realistically, we must expect our full-year profits to fall way short of those of 1999,\" Sir Stuart said. The implications are clear. With 20 weeks ahead of us it's a matter of partners playing their part to win sales and to keep control of costs so that we bring home the best result we can.\"",

When he attacked her White House health policy as \"an unmitigated disaster\", Mrs Clinton played the Jewish card.</p> <p>\"Listening to the congressman's response, reminds me of a word I've heard a lot of this past year: chutzpah ,\" she said. \"He was a deputy whip to Newt Gingrich. He voted to shut the government down,\" she charged.</p> <p>\"You, of all people, Mrs Clinton, should not bring up guilt by association,\" Mr Lazio countered.</p> <p>The panel of local journalists who were asking the questions occasionally managed to get the two candidates to talk policy, but insult and the political low-blow were never far away.</p> <p>A key moment came halfway through the debate, when the anchorman, Tim Russert, asked Mrs Clinton if she could be believed, playing clips from her 1998 \"vast rightwing conspiracy\" television interview at the height of the Monica Lewinsky crisis.</p> <p>Mrs Clinton appeared visibly shaken by the question.</p> <p>\"Well, you know, Tim, that was a very - a very painful time for me, for my family and for our country. It is something that I regret deeply that anyone had to go through. And I wish that we all could look at it from the perspective of history, but we can't yet,\" she said haltingly.</p> <p>Scenting blood, Mr Lazio tried to land a knock-out blow, charging Mrs Clinton with believing \"it only matters what you say when you get caught\". The first lady parried with a plea for a campaign based on \"issues not insults\", but was visibly wounded by the exchange.</p> <p>As the debate entered its final minutes, Mr Lazio tried to pull off a dramatic coup, striding over to Mrs Clinton and asking her to join him in signing a document which he called his \"Freedom From Soft Money Pact\" - a pledge not to accept support from single issue campaign groups.</p> <p>\"Mrs Clinton, if you agree to do this, you'll be making a statement about character and trust to the rest of the country,\" Mr Lazio insisted. \"Why don't you show some leadership?\"</p> <p>Under a flurry of blows from Mr Lazio, Mrs Clinton tried to regain the initiative, saying she had always been prepared to run a campaign without soft money contributions if Mr Lazio's backers would make a similar pledge - something that the Hillary-haters have no intention of doing.</p> <p>As the bell went, Mrs Clinton was hanging on to the ropes, and perhaps also taking comfort in the thought that she is never more popular with the American public than when she seems like a victim.</p> <p><b>Exchange of views, not signatures</b></p> <p><b> Lazio:</b> As America looks to New York, this is an opportunity for us to be able to say: \"We don't have to rely on soft money.\" And my campaign has not aired one commercial nor raised one dollar in soft money. My opponent has raised soft money by the bucket load.</p> <p>I have right here a pledge that I sent over to my opponent. It's a ban on soft money pledge. I'm willing to say we will neither raise nor spend a dime of soft money if my opponent is willing to do the same. And you know what, Mrs Clinton? If you agree to do this, we'll be making a huge statement about character and trust to the rest of the country.</p> <p><b> Clinton:</b> Well, Tim, you know, back in May I made exactly that offer. If you will get signed agreements from all your friends who say they're raising $32m and will not be running so-called independent ads, will not be doing push polling, will not be doing mass mailings that are filled with these outrageous personal attacks, I think we can have an agreement. I'd like to see those signed letters from all those different groups that you have counted on to flood this state.</p> <p>I think if we can get signed agreements from all of your allies, when you wouldn't ask the one group to stop, but if you will get those signed agreements, then, you know, we can make a deal.</p> <p><b> Lazio:</b> I'd be happy to. But I want to get it done right now. I don't want any more wiggle room. I don't want any more evasion.</p> <p>The truth is that Mrs Clinton has been airing millions of dollars in soft-money ads. It's the height of hypocrisy to talk about soft money when she's been raising soft money by the bucketloads out in Hollywood and spending all that money on negative advertising.</p> <p>Here it is. Let's sign it. It's the New York Freedom from Soft Money Pact. I signed it. We can both sit down together. We can all get all the media in here. We will make sure it's an ironclad deal.</p> <p>And I'm happy to abide by anything that we all agree on. But let's get it done now. Let's not get any more wiggle room.</p> <p><b> Clinton:</b> You know, I admire that. That was a wonderful performance.</p> <p><b> Lazio:</b> Well, why don't you sign it?</p> <p><b> Clinton:</b> and you did it very well.</p> <p><b> Lazio:</b> I'm not asking you to admire it. I'm asking you to sign it.</p> <p><b> Clinton:</b> Well, I would be happy to when you give me the signed letters</p> <p><b> Lazio:</b> Right here.

Polls show that Mrs Clinton has only a narrow advantage over him and it was clear from Tuesday's debate, held in Buffalo, that both contenders sense they are in an old-style political knife-fight, in which the viewers' responses to their three scheduled debates will be crucial on polling day. From the bell, the Long Island congressman came out swinging. When he attacked her White House health policy as \"an unmitigated disaster\", Mrs Clinton played the Jewish card. \"Listening to the congressman's response, reminds me of a word I've heard a lot of this past year: chutzpah ,\" she said. \"He was a deputy whip to Newt Gingrich. He voted to shut the government down,\" she charged. \"You, of all people, Mrs Clinton, should not bring up guilt by association,\" Mr Lazio countered. The panel of local journalists who were asking the questions occasionally managed to get the two candidates to talk policy, but insult and the political low-blow were never far away. A key moment came halfway through the debate, when the anchorman, Tim Russert, asked Mrs Clinton if she could be believed, playing clips from her 1998 \"vast rightwing conspiracy\" television interview at the height of the Monica Lewinsky crisis. Mrs Clinton appeared visibly shaken by the question. \"Well, you know, Tim, that was a very - a very painful time for me, for my family and for our country. It is something that I regret deeply that anyone had to go through. And I wish that we all could look at it from the perspective of history, but we can't yet,\" she said haltingly. Scenting blood, Mr Lazio tried to land a knock-out blow, charging Mrs Clinton with believing \"it only matters what you say when you get caught\". The first lady parried with a plea for a campaign based on \"issues not insults\", but was visibly wounded by the exchange. As the debate entered its final minutes, Mr Lazio tried to pull off a dramatic coup, striding over to Mrs Clinton and asking her to join him in signing a document which he called his \"Freedom From Soft Money Pact\" - a pledge not to accept support from single issue campaign groups. \"Mrs Clinton, if you agree to do this, you'll be making a statement about character and trust to the rest of the country,\" Mr Lazio insisted. \"Why don't you show some leadership?\" Under a flurry of blows from Mr Lazio, Mrs Clinton tried to regain the initiative, saying she had always been prepared to run a campaign without soft money contributions if Mr Lazio's backers would make a similar pledge - something that the Hillary-haters have no intention of doing. As the bell went, Mrs Clinton was hanging on to the ropes, and perhaps also taking comfort in the thought that she is never more popular with the American public than when she seems like a victim. Exchange of views, not signatures Lazio: As America looks to New York, this is an opportunity for us to be able to say: \"We don't have to rely on soft money.\" And my campaign has not aired one commercial nor raised one dollar in soft money. My opponent has raised soft money by the bucket load. I have right here a pledge that I sent over to my opponent. It's a ban on soft money pledge. I'm willing to say we will neither raise nor spend a dime of soft money if my opponent is willing to do the same. And you know what, Mrs Clinton? If you agree to do this, we'll be making a huge statement about character and trust to the rest of the country. Clinton: Well, Tim, you know, back in May I made exactly that offer. If you will get signed agreements from all your friends who say they're raising $32m and will not be running so-called independent ads, will not be doing push polling, will not be doing mass mailings that are filled with these outrageous personal attacks, I think we can have an agreement. I'd like to see those signed letters from all those different groups that you have counted on to flood this state. I think if we can get signed agreements from all of your allies, when you wouldn't ask the one group to stop, but if you will get those signed agreements, then, you know, we can make a deal. Lazio: I'd be happy to. But I want to get it done right now. I don't want any more wiggle room. I don't want any more evasion. The truth is that Mrs Clinton has been airing millions of dollars in soft-money ads. It's the height of hypocrisy to talk about soft money when she's been raising soft money by the bucketloads out in Hollywood and spending all that money on negative advertising. Here it is. Let's sign it. It's the New York Freedom from Soft Money Pact. I signed it. We can both sit down together. We can all get all the media in here. We will make sure it's an ironclad deal. And I'm happy to abide by anything that we all agree on. But let's get it done now. Let's not get any more wiggle room. Clinton: You know, I admire that. That was a wonderful performance. Lazio: Well, why don't you sign it? Clinton: and you did it very well. Lazio: I'm not asking you to admire it. I'm asking you to sign it. Clinton: Well, I would be happy to when you give me the signed letters Lazio: Right here. Right here. Clinton: When you give me the Lazio: Sign it right now. Clinton: well, we'll shake - we'll shake on it. Lazio: No, I want your signature, because I think everybody wants to see you signing something that you said you were for.",

The Most Rev Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, said the family should be allowed to leave the country, if they wished, and take up an offer of care in Italy. He was making an unprecedented intervention in the life-and-death dilemma over the twins, who were born at St Mary's hospital, Manchester, on August 8. Without an operation it was originally expected both would die within six months, although fresh information came to light in court yesterday which suggested they could survive longer. On the fifth day of the appeal from the girls' parents against a high court ruling that they should be separated, the archbishop made written submissions to the judges. He set out arguments stemming from the belief \"that God has given to humankind the gift of life, and as such it is to be revered and cherished. \"Though the duty to preserve life is a serious duty, no such duty exists when the only available means of preserving life involves a grave injustice. \"In this case, if what is envisaged is the killing of, or a deliberate lethal assault on, one of the twins, Mary, in order to save the other, Jodie, there is a grave injustice involved. \"The good end would not justify the means.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The censor is to take a much more relaxed attitude to sex in 18 certificate films in the first formal loosening of Britain's relatively prudish screen code.</p> <p>The British Board of Film Classification said yesterday it would now \"only rarely\" cut explicit scenes after a six-month consultation process found the public would rather make up their own minds about what was acceptable.</p> <p>But the new liberal mood to sex - which extends to some degree to violence - disguises a far more restrictive line on drugs and bad language in films aimed at younger audiences.</p> <p>In the commercially crucial 15 category - where the board has frequently been at loggerheads with film-makers who view the 18 certificate as a box office death sentence - strong language will \"only be rarely acceptable\".</p> <p>After the recent furore over the \"ludicrous\" 18 rating given to The End of the Affair, there is to be a more permissive attitude to sex in 15 certificate films.</p> <p>Significantly, however, the relaxation applies only to its depiction in \"responsible, loving and developing relationships\". Casual sex, the board warns, should be \"handled responsibly\".</p> <p>Last night Pact, the producers' alliance which represents the bulk of British film-makers, gave the changes a cautious welcome but claimed there was a \"touch of moral panic about them\".</p> <p>The guidelines show their teeth in the depiction of drug use. All mention of them in U films and videos will be banned, references severely curtailed at PG, 12 and 15 levels, while scenes akin to those in Trainspotting which give \"instructive detail\" in 18 certificate films will be cut.</p> <p>Robin Duval, the BBFC's director, revealed that if Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction - in which John Travolta played a hitman with a heroin habit - came before him now, he would consider cutting it.</p> <p>Mr Duval admitted that with film-makers like Tarantino and his many imitators there were \"difficult calls to be made between promoting and portraying violence\". He said the board was now prepared to \"take extreme action\" against films which promoted such cruelty.</p> <p>The board's president, Andreas Whittam Smith, who is seen as steering a more conservative course than the previous regime under James Ferman, said he had worries about the blurring of the line between \"comic or stylised violence\" and scenes which revelled and gloried in it.</p> <p>He said he aimed to alter the guidelines every few years in line with changing attitudes, but warned that this \"does not mean they will shift in the same direction\".</p> <p>The new rules were \"not a sea change\" but simply a clarification of the way decisions were now made. Even so, Mr Whittam Smith admitted the BBFC would still find itself \"in a pickle\" with the growing trend towards \"naturalistic\" sex scenes in arthouse films like Romance and Seul Contre Tous. He said the board would never be able to pass anything which conflicted with the Obscene Publications Act.</p> <p>But he made a stout defence of the board's decision to be less proscriptive about sex scenes in 15 films.</p> <p>\"We have the toughest guidelines in the world on film already and still we have the highest level of teenage pregnancy,\" he said. \"We have the power to intervene and cut which they do not have abroad, we have mandatory certification, and we also control the video market.\"</p> <p>The BBFC's decision to err on the side of tolerance at 18 comes after it was forced to relax the rules on sex videos after being defeated in the high court earlier this year. The explicit R18 films are available only through licensed sex shops.</p> <p>But the new guidelines themselves follow a study, Sense and Sensibilities, commissioned by the board a year ago into public attitudes.</p> <p>The research showed 56% of those surveyed thought young people used bad language because of what they heard in films. Nearly half, however, thought adults should be allowed to watch real sex on the screen.</p> <p><b>Censorship ... and sensibility</b></p> <p><b> Sex</b> <br>The End Of The Affair - and Ralph Fiennes' offending buttocks - will now pass as 15 rather than getting an 18 rating, while the difficulty in passing \"real sex\" scenes in arthouse films like The Idiots and Romance are now eased because they can be \"exceptionally justified by context\".</p> <p><b> Violence</b> <br>The more liberal line on the 18 rating means The Fight Club, in which Brad Pitt and Edward Norton starred as corporate suits who relaxed through bare-knuckle boxing, would now pass uncut. Last House on the Left, the only film the BBFC refused to certify this year, would still not pass because of its \"incendiary mix of sex and violence\".</p> <p><b> Drugs</b><br> Several scenes in Trainspotting which could be interpreted as giving \"instructional detail\" on drug-taking could now go, while \"if Pulp Fiction were to come to us now, we would look at that scene where we see John Travolta in a car high on heroin with a little more concern\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "The censor is to take a much more relaxed attitude to sex in 18 certificate films in the first formal loosening of Britain's relatively prudish screen code. The British Board of Film Classification said yesterday it would now \"only rarely\" cut explicit scenes after a six-month consultation process found the public would rather make up their own minds about what was acceptable. But the new liberal mood to sex - which extends to some degree to violence - disguises a far more restrictive line on drugs and bad language in films aimed at younger audiences. In the commercially crucial 15 category - where the board has frequently been at loggerheads with film-makers who view the 18 certificate as a box office death sentence - strong language will \"only be rarely acceptable\". After the recent furore over the \"ludicrous\" 18 rating given to The End of the Affair, there is to be a more permissive attitude to sex in 15 certificate films. Significantly, however, the relaxation applies only to its depiction in \"responsible, loving and developing relationships\". Casual sex, the board warns, should be \"handled responsibly\". Last night Pact, the producers' alliance which represents the bulk of British film-makers, gave the changes a cautious welcome but claimed there was a \"touch of moral panic about them\". The guidelines show their teeth in the depiction of drug use. All mention of them in U films and videos will be banned, references severely curtailed at PG, 12 and 15 levels, while scenes akin to those in Trainspotting which give \"instructive detail\" in 18 certificate films will be cut. Robin Duval, the BBFC's director, revealed that if Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction - in which John Travolta played a hitman with a heroin habit - came before him now, he would consider cutting it. Mr Duval admitted that with film-makers like Tarantino and his many imitators there were \"difficult calls to be made between promoting and portraying violence\". He said the board was now prepared to \"take extreme action\" against films which promoted such cruelty. The board's president, Andreas Whittam Smith, who is seen as steering a more conservative course than the previous regime under James Ferman, said he had worries about the blurring of the line between \"comic or stylised violence\" and scenes which revelled and gloried in it. He said he aimed to alter the guidelines every few years in line with changing attitudes, but warned that this \"does not mean they will shift in the same direction\". The new rules were \"not a sea change\" but simply a clarification of the way decisions were now made. Even so, Mr Whittam Smith admitted the BBFC would still find itself \"in a pickle\" with the growing trend towards \"naturalistic\" sex scenes in arthouse films like Romance and Seul Contre Tous. He said the board would never be able to pass anything which conflicted with the Obscene Publications Act. But he made a stout defence of the board's decision to be less proscriptive about sex scenes in 15 films. \"We have the toughest guidelines in the world on film already and still we have the highest level of teenage pregnancy,\" he said. \"We have the power to intervene and cut which they do not have abroad, we have mandatory certification, and we also control the video market.\" The BBFC's decision to err on the side of tolerance at 18 comes after it was forced to relax the rules on sex videos after being defeated in the high court earlier this year. The explicit R18 films are available only through licensed sex shops. But the new guidelines themselves follow a study, Sense and Sensibilities, commissioned by the board a year ago into public attitudes. The research showed 56% of those surveyed thought young people used bad language because of what they heard in films. Nearly half, however, thought adults should be allowed to watch real sex on the screen. Censorship ... and sensibility Sex The End Of The Affair - and Ralph Fiennes' offending buttocks - will now pass as 15 rather than getting an 18 rating, while the difficulty in passing \"real sex\" scenes in arthouse films like The Idiots and Romance are now eased because they can be \"exceptionally justified by context\". Violence The more liberal line on the 18 rating means The Fight Club, in which Brad Pitt and Edward Norton starred as corporate suits who relaxed through bare-knuckle boxing, would now pass uncut. Last House on the Left, the only film the BBFC refused to certify this year, would still not pass because of its \"incendiary mix of sex and violence\". Drugs Several scenes in Trainspotting which could be interpreted as giving \"instructional detail\" on drug-taking could now go, while \"if Pulp Fiction were to come to us now, we would look at that scene where we see John Travolta in a car high on heroin with a little more concern\".",

Lord Bagri, chairman of the LME, said the trading system would be designed with enough capacity to replace the dealing ring entirely, if necessary. By introducing electronic system methods, the LME is following a tortuous route taken by the London Stock Exchange more than a decade ago and more recently by Liffe, the futures and options exchange. Lord Bagri said that the demutualisation of the LME, which has only been a mutual institution for 15 years, had been motivated by the need to invest heavily in technology. \"Like all the other exchanges we are under threat from the dot.coms of this world,\" he said.

Yesterday his family said that his taped confession, which they only recently obtained, contained errors which proved he was not the real killer.</p> <p>They were supported by the family of Mary Sullivan, who was found dead in 1964 at the end of the Boston Strangler's two-year killing spree, which left at least 11 women dead. DeSalvo claimed he had raped Sullivan in the course of the murder, but her family said the autopsy report they obtained on Tuesday included no evidence of sexual assault.</p> <p>Elaine Sharp, a lawyer representing both families, said: \"I think it is one of the major parts of the confession that he made, and he got it wrong. He just plain got it wrong, and the reason he got it wrong, we believe, was because he was not there.\"</p> <p>DeSalvo also claimed that he gagged Sullivan, but no traces of a gag were found. His confession was the only evidence linking him to the crime.</p> <p>\"If you murdered somebody, wouldn't you remember what you did?\" Ms Sharp asked. \"So our position is: let's reopen the case. But the government has put up roadblocks for no apparent reason.\"</p> <p>Ann Donlan, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts attorney general's office, said that as the case had never gone to court it had never formally been closed. Therefore evidence could not be made available, despite such a promise earlier this year by the attorney general, Tom Reilly.

      "bodyText": "The case of the Boston Strangler is back in the news after claims by relatives of the chief suspect and the Strangler's last victim that police arrested the wrong man in the 1960s, and that the real serial killer is still at large. Albert DeSalvo confessed to being the Boston Strangler but was murdered in his jail cell in 1973 before he could be tried. Yesterday his family said that his taped confession, which they only recently obtained, contained errors which proved he was not the real killer. They were supported by the family of Mary Sullivan, who was found dead in 1964 at the end of the Boston Strangler's two-year killing spree, which left at least 11 women dead. DeSalvo claimed he had raped Sullivan in the course of the murder, but her family said the autopsy report they obtained on Tuesday included no evidence of sexual assault. Elaine Sharp, a lawyer representing both families, said: \"I think it is one of the major parts of the confession that he made, and he got it wrong. He just plain got it wrong, and the reason he got it wrong, we believe, was because he was not there.\" DeSalvo also claimed that he gagged Sullivan, but no traces of a gag were found. His confession was the only evidence linking him to the crime. \"If you murdered somebody, wouldn't you remember what you did?\" Ms Sharp asked. \"So our position is: let's reopen the case. But the government has put up roadblocks for no apparent reason.\" Ann Donlan, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts attorney general's office, said that as the case had never gone to court it had never formally been closed. Therefore evidence could not be made available, despite such a promise earlier this year by the attorney general, Tom Reilly. The Boston police department announced that it would formally cease its investigation of the case due to the deterioration of the evidence. The families are suing Mr Reilly, the chief medical examiner, the Massachusetts police and the Boston police for access to all the evidence. They hope to exhume the bodies of Sullivan and DeSalvo, who was murdered by a fellow inmate while serving a sentence on unrelated charges in prison, so that modern DNA-testing could be used. A leading forensic scientist, James Starr from George Washington University, has volunteered to take on the investigation if the relatives succeed in their bid to examine the evidence. Thirteen single women were murdered in their homes between June 1962 and January 1964. At least 11 of the murders were thought to have been committed by a single killer, known as the Boston Strangler because of his habit of garrotting his victims with articles of their clothing.",

It seems all the more amazing, then, to learn that hospital drama Casualty - which returns to BBC1 tomorrow night - is now in its 15th season. And more to the point, its format has remained pretty much unchanged in years, still offsetting its sophisticated soap structure with acts of crowd-pleasing carnage committed in the name of \"household accidents\". </p> <p>It's a similar story with ITV's Always &amp; Everyone, and even Channel 4's popular US import ER, in which, week in, week out, a series of crises affecting the medical team are set against a sequence of medical emergencies at times both bloody and bizarre. Casualty's familiar format, however, is actually part of its appeal, believes BBC TV head of drama series Mal Young, who rebuffs any suggestion that the programme itself is simply treading water. \"Casualty has succeeded because every year it has evolved and moved on,\" he insists. \"Look at early programmes, or even those just two or three years old and they seem dated. The whole point of the series, I feel, is that each series should be 'of the moment'.\" </p> <p>To achieve this quality for each new season, the series' producers go into real hospitals to research the topical issues affecting medical staff's daily working lives. Last year it was assaults on hospital staff - which made it into both Casualty and its mid-week spin-off, Holby City. This year will see a return to politics, the thorny issue that brought so much flak from the Conservative government during their time in power. The irony of resurrecting the subject under Blair's New Labour will not be lost on die-hard viewers. \"A lot of senior nurses complain that they are becoming clerics,\" explains Young. \"This season we have a new, non-medical hospital administrator. I wanted to give the new series that sort of admin-versus-medicine pressure.\" </p> <p>Over at ITV, Pamela Wilson, producer of the third series of Always &amp; Everyone, which goes into production later this month for transmission next spring, is also adamant her series has refreshed rather than replicated the hospital TV tradition. \"I think A&amp;E reinvented the genre,\" she claims. \"Its approach is very unlike Casualty's. It's focused tightly on the hospital setting, concerned chiefly with the core team of staff, and in terms of \"look\", it's more glossy. This is not about the NHS in crisis.\" </p> <p>Both Casualty and A&amp;E are aimed at a peaktime, family audience, she adds - one reason why certain limits exist when it comes to pushing the traditions of the genre. \"A key reason people watch is because every one of us has so much empathy for people in hospital,\" she explains. \"When you go into hospital you feel very much in a weak position. In many ways you want doctors to be omnipotent, to have all the answers.\" </p> <p>Some viewers may be operation obsessives, for whom the minutiae of medical detail are fascinating, she concedes. \"But for the majority, the most pressing concern is to get to the emotional truth. You can very easily exploit a storyline, but if you do so you risk alienating an audience because they'll quickly see you're taking out more than you put back in.\" </p> <p>For Young, the appeal of shows like Casualty is that, though the times and issues change, the basics stay the same. \"However much society changes, who looks after our health and our legal system is a constant concern,\" he says. And unlike the arguably more fashionable cop series, medical crises are a great leveller. \"At some point all of us will die,\" he adds, \"and in drama terms what better drama can there be than - quite literally - life and death?\" </p> <p>So is it the enormity of such themes, then, that limits scope for variation on the theme? Or does it have more to do with giving audiences exactly what they want? The answer is a bit of both, it seems. When Tony Garnett came up with Cardiac Arrest - a hospital drama with an unstinting focus on the blacker aspects of medical life - the BBC1 series attracted a solid cult following in a post-10.30pm slot. But when he developed The Cops - a similarly gritty portrayal of the seamier side of life for our boys and girls in blue - it was honoured with a primetime 9pm slot (albeit it on BBC2). </p> <p>In ITV primetime there is a limit to how far you can or would want to go with the idea of doctor as anti-hero, Wilson says. Even ER, she adds, pulls its punches - Dr Romano may be an irritating git, but he's still a fantastic doctor. \"Heroes strike the real popular chord,\" Young acknowledges. \"But just because a programme like Casualty focuses on heroes doesn't mean it's not relevant, or contemporary.\" </p> <p>Casualty, 8.05pm, Saturday, BBC1</p>",

      "body": "<p>I'm a 13-year-old girl who attends a single-sex grammar school. For almost a year now I have known that I am a lesbian. I have told no one about it.</p> <p>It makes me very uncomfortable when people laugh at homosexuals. My friends, I think, suspect. This secrecy is a constant source of anxiety to me. Added to the normal pressures of being a teenager, it makes life almost unbearable, and living with me must also be almost unbearable as it makes me very emotional.</p> <p>I would like to be open about this, but I am worried about how people will react. Should I acknowledge my homosexuality openly or confide only in my closest friends for the moment? Or should I tell no one?</p> <p>I live in quite a small town and I doubt it can be kept a secret from everyone for long. What do you think I should do?</p> <p><b> It's OK, you're normal</b></p> <p>Has any girl ever gone through her hormone-packed teenage years in the unnatural atmosphere of a single-sex grammar school without strong lesbian feelings? Between the wars, we girls had never heard of lesbianism, but we sure experienced it. It was called \"having a pash\", short for \"passion\", and I still vividly remember the sexual electricity involved, not to mention the tears.</p> <p>I do feel for you young things today who are so pressurised by public attitudes to sex - especially those of your peer group - that you have to bottle up your feelings and put little secret labels on them. Unaware of the nature of what was happening to us, or of any taboos around it (apart from an implanted fear of the unknown opposite sex), we could talk freely to each other, so we knew we were all in the same boat. Whatever front they put up, are you sure you and your friends are not?</p> <p>It's worth remembering that when we left this skewed sexual hothouse for the real world, we sorted ourselves out along the whole gamut from wild heterosexuality, through marriage, then sex (in that order in those days), to cheerful bisexuality and all the way to lifelong lesbianism in pairs then thought of just as \"best friends sensibly sharing expenses\". At 13, it would have been impossible to tell which of us would be which.</p> <p>So cheer up. Whichever you are, you're normal.</p> <p><b> Hilary Semmens, Weston-super-Mare</b></p> <p><b> Confide in a close friend</b></p> <p>I am 13 and I also go to a single-sex grammar school. My best friend, I suspect, may be a lesbian but I can't be sure. I think that you should confide in your closest friends. That's what I would do, although you would need a lot of courage. If your friends tell everybody, they aren't what I would call close. If this happens, laugh it off and reply that you were only joking. Good luck!</p> <p><b> Name and address withheld</b></p> <p><b> Live life as it comes</b></p> <p>Please don't feel that you are fixed in these feelings for the rest of your life. It is quite a normal part of growing up to find you love people of your own sex.</p> <p>I was at a girls' school in the 40s and had several \"crushes\" on teachers and other girls - as did many others.</p> <p>The dangerous thing today, both for girls and boys, is that they are cornered into feeling \"this is it\" for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>Just relax about your feelings, live life as it comes and enjoy all that lies ahead of you.</p> <p><b> Name and address withheld</b></p> <p><b> Tell someone you trust</b></p> <p>I know how you feel. I am a 16-year-old in the same situation. I think that if you let yourself worry about this too much it will spoil your life. For a start, why do you think you're gay? If you've got a crush on one female, you're probably just normal. Apparently lots of people go through it. I'm not trying to patronise you by saying this, but you need to be sure if you want to come out, because a lot of people will definitely tell you that you're \"too young\" or that you should not worry.</p> <p>You say you're worried about how people will react. When I came out about a year ago I only told my close friends, but it didn't bother them and they were mostly just interested. One of my friends is homophobic and, although she thinks it's unnatural to be gay, she doesn't hate me for it. We are still good friends. So I would tell someone you trust, which will be good for your peace of mind. Then you can decide whether or not you want to tell more people. You say you don't think you can keep it a secret from your community in general.</p> <p>In that case, don't tell anyone you don't trust, and ask those people you do tell to keep quiet. Then you can decide how confident you are with your situation, and who else you should tell. I bet some people will react badly, and will still make insulting remarks about gays (which do really hurt, I know), but in general I found that most people are quite supportive if you don't make a big thing of it - and if you tell your friends you're definitely not interested in them! There are lots of us out there, so don't worry.</p> <p><b> Elisabeth Darcy by email</b></p> <p><b> Take your time</b></p> <p>Don't think about coming out until, first, you are sure about your sexuality, second, you are relaxed and comfortable with it and, third, you have supportive people around you who have been through the same experience. You need to get to know other gay people and have a chance to talk about what's going on for you. Ring London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard on 020-7837 7324 and get the number of your local Gay Switchboard or Lesbian Line (these are also listed in the phone book and the back of magazines like Gay Times and Diva). Most cities and towns have groups to support people in your position, although you may have to travel. Your local line can tell you about these and also talk to you and give you support. When you are ready to come out about your sexuality, do it in your own good time, and start with people who you think will be sympathetic and supportive. Good luck!</p> <p><b> M Christie, Nottingham</b></p> <p><b> Choose your moment</b></p> <p>I too am from a small town. When I was growing up it would have been inconceivable for any of my friends to have come out. Many years later one of them did. Of course I knew, but how I wish she could have told me when we were teenagers. On the other hand, five years after I left, my sister's best friend came out at the age of 13. He was received better than you could have imagined. There will always be people who will be cruel about any differences; this cannot be avoided, whatever your sexual orientation.</p> <p>If you feel it is right, tell your closest female friends first and take it from there. However, your sexuality is a private matter and does not have to be placed on public view. If I were you, I would spend the next couple of years thinking about what you want to do with your life and building your confidence. You will know when the time is right. And if people cannot accept you, remember: it's their problem, not yours. I wish you happiness.</p> <p><b> Polly, London</b></p> <p><b>I have been in a relationship for five years. My partner has an ex-wife and they have a 19-year-old. They divorced 18 years ago. I have a 17-year-old. It's a committed relationship and nine months ago we bought a house.

      "bodyText": "I'm a 13-year-old girl who attends a single-sex grammar school. For almost a year now I have known that I am a lesbian. I have told no one about it. It makes me very uncomfortable when people laugh at homosexuals. My friends, I think, suspect. This secrecy is a constant source of anxiety to me. Added to the normal pressures of being a teenager, it makes life almost unbearable, and living with me must also be almost unbearable as it makes me very emotional. I would like to be open about this, but I am worried about how people will react. Should I acknowledge my homosexuality openly or confide only in my closest friends for the moment? Or should I tell no one? I live in quite a small town and I doubt it can be kept a secret from everyone for long. What do you think I should do? It's OK, you're normal Has any girl ever gone through her hormone-packed teenage years in the unnatural atmosphere of a single-sex grammar school without strong lesbian feelings? Between the wars, we girls had never heard of lesbianism, but we sure experienced it. It was called \"having a pash\", short for \"passion\", and I still vividly remember the sexual electricity involved, not to mention the tears. I do feel for you young things today who are so pressurised by public attitudes to sex - especially those of your peer group - that you have to bottle up your feelings and put little secret labels on them. Unaware of the nature of what was happening to us, or of any taboos around it (apart from an implanted fear of the unknown opposite sex), we could talk freely to each other, so we knew we were all in the same boat. Whatever front they put up, are you sure you and your friends are not? It's worth remembering that when we left this skewed sexual hothouse for the real world, we sorted ourselves out along the whole gamut from wild heterosexuality, through marriage, then sex (in that order in those days), to cheerful bisexuality and all the way to lifelong lesbianism in pairs then thought of just as \"best friends sensibly sharing expenses\". At 13, it would have been impossible to tell which of us would be which. So cheer up. Whichever you are, you're normal. Hilary Semmens, Weston-super-Mare Confide in a close friend I am 13 and I also go to a single-sex grammar school. My best friend, I suspect, may be a lesbian but I can't be sure. I think that you should confide in your closest friends. That's what I would do, although you would need a lot of courage. If your friends tell everybody, they aren't what I would call close. If this happens, laugh it off and reply that you were only joking. Good luck! Name and address withheld Live life as it comes Please don't feel that you are fixed in these feelings for the rest of your life. It is quite a normal part of growing up to find you love people of your own sex. I was at a girls' school in the 40s and had several \"crushes\" on teachers and other girls - as did many others. The dangerous thing today, both for girls and boys, is that they are cornered into feeling \"this is it\" for the rest of their lives. Just relax about your feelings, live life as it comes and enjoy all that lies ahead of you. Name and address withheld Tell someone you trust I know how you feel. I am a 16-year-old in the same situation. I think that if you let yourself worry about this too much it will spoil your life. For a start, why do you think you're gay? If you've got a crush on one female, you're probably just normal. Apparently lots of people go through it. I'm not trying to patronise you by saying this, but you need to be sure if you want to come out, because a lot of people will definitely tell you that you're \"too young\" or that you should not worry. You say you're worried about how people will react. When I came out about a year ago I only told my close friends, but it didn't bother them and they were mostly just interested. One of my friends is homophobic and, although she thinks it's unnatural to be gay, she doesn't hate me for it. We are still good friends. So I would tell someone you trust, which will be good for your peace of mind. Then you can decide whether or not you want to tell more people. You say you don't think you can keep it a secret from your community in general. In that case, don't tell anyone you don't trust, and ask those people you do tell to keep quiet. Then you can decide how confident you are with your situation, and who else you should tell. I bet some people will react badly, and will still make insulting remarks about gays (which do really hurt, I know), but in general I found that most people are quite supportive if you don't make a big thing of it - and if you tell your friends you're definitely not interested in them! There are lots of us out there, so don't worry. Elisabeth Darcy by email Take your time Don't think about coming out until, first, you are sure about your sexuality, second, you are relaxed and comfortable with it and, third, you have supportive people around you who have been through the same experience. You need to get to know other gay people and have a chance to talk about what's going on for you. Ring London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard on 020-7837 7324 and get the number of your local Gay Switchboard or Lesbian Line (these are also listed in the phone book and the back of magazines like Gay Times and Diva). Most cities and towns have groups to support people in your position, although you may have to travel. Your local line can tell you about these and also talk to you and give you support. When you are ready to come out about your sexuality, do it in your own good time, and start with people who you think will be sympathetic and supportive. Good luck! M Christie, Nottingham Choose your moment I too am from a small town. When I was growing up it would have been inconceivable for any of my friends to have come out. Many years later one of them did. Of course I knew, but how I wish she could have told me when we were teenagers. On the other hand, five years after I left, my sister's best friend came out at the age of 13. He was received better than you could have imagined. There will always be people who will be cruel about any differences; this cannot be avoided, whatever your sexual orientation. If you feel it is right, tell your closest female friends first and take it from there. However, your sexuality is a private matter and does not have to be placed on public view. If I were you, I would spend the next couple of years thinking about what you want to do with your life and building your confidence. You will know when the time is right. And if people cannot accept you, remember: it's their problem, not yours. I wish you happiness. Polly, London I have been in a relationship for five years. My partner has an ex-wife and they have a 19-year-old. They divorced 18 years ago. I have a 17-year-old. It's a committed relationship and nine months ago we bought a house. Recently I discovered that over a two-month period my partner had written and sent pornographic emails to his ex-wife and that she had been replying. When I confronted him he said that it was \"a game\" they had both played and that he was neither in love with nor attracted to her. They also had phone sex. This broke the rules we'd made regarding fidelity and I was crushed. However, it did lead to an open admittance of our dissatisfactions, and some improvements were made. Three months on from the discovery, I am plagued by paranoia and no longer trust or like my partner, though I seem unwilling to leave him. I also feel a new hatred for him - and for myself. How do you stay with someone and remain sane after something like this? Private Lives appears every Friday. Each week we publish a letter to which readers are invited to respond.

SCI's deal with Xicat Interactive coincided with the president of Sega in the US, Peter Moore, making a voluntary statement to the senate commerce committee in Washington about the impact of violent video games on children. The statement was in response to a report from the federal trade commission accusing games manufacturers of \"making little effort\" to restrict children's access to violent games. Carmageddon TVR 2000, in which players score points by using fast cars to kill pedestrians, will be one of three new SCI titles for Xicat to market and distribute in the US. The new Sony PlayStation game, Mille Miglia, will also be distributed as part of the deal.

Jack MacGowran and Polanski are the anything-but-fearless killers, and the director's ill-fated future wife, Sharon Tate, the Transylvanian village girl they must save.

      "bodyText": "Clerks (Kevin Smith, 1994) 10pm, FilmFour It cost around $28,000 to make and, stuffed with appropriately cheap gags, it's an absolute steal. Smith's hilarious comedy revolves around the lives - mainly sex lives - of shop assistants Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson), and the scenes in which they deal with outraged customers have the scabrous zest of Groucho Marx. Plus wonderful debates on Dante's girlfriend's Deep Throat tendencies, and whether The Empire Strikes Back is better than Return Of The Jedi. The Fearless Vampire Killers (Roman Polanski, 1967) 11pm, TCM A zesty spoof, enacted with a childlike glee - see Alfie Bass as a Jewish vampire scoffing at the crucifix. Jack MacGowran and Polanski are the anything-but-fearless killers, and the director's ill-fated future wife, Sharon Tate, the Transylvanian village girl they must save. A visually haunting dark delight.

      "body": "<p>So it's goodbye Big Brother. It all ends tonight when, if the bookies are correct, Craig will be voted the winner by several million viewers. It has been great fun, and it will be missed - for a few weeks at least - but how important has it been? </p> <p>Some commentators have praised it to the skies as the most exciting new innovation on television for many years, a brilliant scientific experiment that gives us new insights into human nature. Others have damned it as the lowest depths to which television commissioners have sunk - nothing more than cruel, boring, exploitative voyeurism. Few, if any, critics have taken the middle path and seen it for what it really is - a highly entertaining way of passing the odd half-hour during the summer evenings. </p> <p>The idea that, for the viewer, this was a major scientific experiment is laughable. All we were allowed to see were edited highlights. If we did learn anything it was about the psychology of the television editors, not the housemates. We discovered what they thought would entertain us and how far they would go with revealing the intimate actions of the participants. Each day, at least 23 hours of actions were hidden from us. This was a major editing task, apparently carried out by a team of maiden aunts, judging by the prim way they protected us from anything remotely biological. </p> <p>As for the inmates themselves, their situation was so artificial and complex that it told us very little about the way they would behave, in private, under normal circumstances. Every action they made in the Big Brother house had three agendas. First it had a personal element. They expressed themselves honestly as individuals, for themselves. Second it had a group element. They expressed themselves dishonestly in such a way that they would not encourage the others to vote them out. Third it had a viewer element. They expressed themselves dishonestly to curry favour with the viewers, who would decide the final winner of the competition. </p> <p>They never forgot for one moment that they were on TV and that every move they made would influence the casting of viewers' votes. It was amusing to watch the different ways in which they reacted to this situation. Two of them, Anna and Darren, decided on the relentlessly nice guy strategy. They never had a bad word to say about anyone, and were always helpful, humorous and kindly. </p> <p>Craig is the odds-on winner largely because it was he who confronted the group's villain, Nasty Nick. Craig's appeal may also stem from the fact that he is too dim to be capable of any complex strategy or underhand subterfuge. He is one of the lads, the practical joker in the pub, the Gazza in the team. One of Falstaff's recruits. </p> <p>With the seven rejects it was nearly always a few moments of truth that let them down, rather than the sum of their actions. Sada blew it by being fussy over her food, and engaging in New Age mysticism, instead of mucking in with the gang. </p> <p>Andy committed the error of boasting about his unusual sexual exploits. Big mistake. Boasting is simply not British and he had to go. Next came cackling Caroline and naked Nichola, both evicted for their mercurial emotions. They were constitutionally incapable of maintaining that secretly still-valued British commodity, the stiff upper lip. All was forgiven later, when, in a moment of alcoholic exuberance, they managed to knock Vanessa Feltz flat on her face at a social event in London. But by then it was impossible to re-admit them. </p> <p>Nicholas, aka Nasty Nick, was a strange case. He decided to play the role of diplomat and made himself immensely popular with the other housemates. Like Sir Humphrey in Yes, Minister, we loved watching him work his slithering way around the plot, utterly devoid of morals, and were heartbroken when he had to go. Tom was the next to go. He had decided to play the brooding, thoughtfully smouldering, Quiet Man role and had done so to a point of boring the viewers. </p> <p>Because of Nick's removal from the house, he had to be replaced. Enter Claire, a ladette fresh from the bars of Ibiza, much to the fury of the Racing Post, whose betting plans were thrown awry. The viewers removed her as soon as they had a chance. </p> <p>This left only one more to be evicted and to her own great surprise it was Melanie. She had been full of promise and was even tipped to win, until she failed to join in the falsely effusive welcoming ritual for the newcomer, Claire, folding her arms in a classic barrier signal that let out a silent shout saying: \"I am the sexy one in here, clear off!\" This momentary lapse into emotional honesty was her downfall, leading to public anti-Melanie booing when Claire departed. </p> <p>So much for the individual inmates of the Big Brother house. We learned a little about their strengths and their weaknesses but, putting it into perspective, this was because it was a well-designed competitive game show, not a revolutionary scientific experiment. What of the rival claim, that it is all debased voyeurism? Do these critics know what the word voyeurism means? It is the obtaining of sexual gratification from watching, rather than participating in, the act of copulation. Anyone who managed to achieve mild sexual arousal, let alone full sexual gratification, from watching this television series is seriously in need of help. </p> <p>In the post-eviction interviews, the wildly manic Davina McCall, whipped up by producers into a frenzy of dogged vulgarity, kept demanding that the evictees ditch the dirt on events in the house. She even sank to searching through their garbage bin for condoms, without success. Dirt? Filth? She must be joking. Blue Peter is smuttier than this. </p> <p>As for invasion of privacy, have the critics forgotten that the inmates are all volunteers and that they are free to leave at any time? And with the programme editors forcibly diverting our gaze from all bodily functions there is about as much invasion of privacy as there is with contestants on the Antiques Roadshow. </p> <p>So if it is not serious science and it is not depraved ogling, what is it? At first it was reminiscent of being trapped in a delayed flight at Gatwick.

      "bodyText": "So it's goodbye Big Brother. It all ends tonight when, if the bookies are correct, Craig will be voted the winner by several million viewers. It has been great fun, and it will be missed - for a few weeks at least - but how important has it been? Some commentators have praised it to the skies as the most exciting new innovation on television for many years, a brilliant scientific experiment that gives us new insights into human nature. Others have damned it as the lowest depths to which television commissioners have sunk - nothing more than cruel, boring, exploitative voyeurism. Few, if any, critics have taken the middle path and seen it for what it really is - a highly entertaining way of passing the odd half-hour during the summer evenings. The idea that, for the viewer, this was a major scientific experiment is laughable. All we were allowed to see were edited highlights. If we did learn anything it was about the psychology of the television editors, not the housemates. We discovered what they thought would entertain us and how far they would go with revealing the intimate actions of the participants. Each day, at least 23 hours of actions were hidden from us. This was a major editing task, apparently carried out by a team of maiden aunts, judging by the prim way they protected us from anything remotely biological. As for the inmates themselves, their situation was so artificial and complex that it told us very little about the way they would behave, in private, under normal circumstances. Every action they made in the Big Brother house had three agendas. First it had a personal element. They expressed themselves honestly as individuals, for themselves. Second it had a group element. They expressed themselves dishonestly in such a way that they would not encourage the others to vote them out. Third it had a viewer element. They expressed themselves dishonestly to curry favour with the viewers, who would decide the final winner of the competition. They never forgot for one moment that they were on TV and that every move they made would influence the casting of viewers' votes. It was amusing to watch the different ways in which they reacted to this situation. Two of them, Anna and Darren, decided on the relentlessly nice guy strategy. They never had a bad word to say about anyone, and were always helpful, humorous and kindly. Craig is the odds-on winner largely because it was he who confronted the group's villain, Nasty Nick. Craig's appeal may also stem from the fact that he is too dim to be capable of any complex strategy or underhand subterfuge. He is one of the lads, the practical joker in the pub, the Gazza in the team. One of Falstaff's recruits. With the seven rejects it was nearly always a few moments of truth that let them down, rather than the sum of their actions. Sada blew it by being fussy over her food, and engaging in New Age mysticism, instead of mucking in with the gang. Andy committed the error of boasting about his unusual sexual exploits. Big mistake. Boasting is simply not British and he had to go. Next came cackling Caroline and naked Nichola, both evicted for their mercurial emotions. They were constitutionally incapable of maintaining that secretly still-valued British commodity, the stiff upper lip. All was forgiven later, when, in a moment of alcoholic exuberance, they managed to knock Vanessa Feltz flat on her face at a social event in London. But by then it was impossible to re-admit them. Nicholas, aka Nasty Nick, was a strange case. He decided to play the role of diplomat and made himself immensely popular with the other housemates. Like Sir Humphrey in Yes, Minister, we loved watching him work his slithering way around the plot, utterly devoid of morals, and were heartbroken when he had to go. Tom was the next to go. He had decided to play the brooding, thoughtfully smouldering, Quiet Man role and had done so to a point of boring the viewers. Because of Nick's removal from the house, he had to be replaced. Enter Claire, a ladette fresh from the bars of Ibiza, much to the fury of the Racing Post, whose betting plans were thrown awry. The viewers removed her as soon as they had a chance. This left only one more to be evicted and to her own great surprise it was Melanie. She had been full of promise and was even tipped to win, until she failed to join in the falsely effusive welcoming ritual for the newcomer, Claire, folding her arms in a classic barrier signal that let out a silent shout saying: \"I am the sexy one in here, clear off!\" This momentary lapse into emotional honesty was her downfall, leading to public anti-Melanie booing when Claire departed. So much for the individual inmates of the Big Brother house. We learned a little about their strengths and their weaknesses but, putting it into perspective, this was because it was a well-designed competitive game show, not a revolutionary scientific experiment. What of the rival claim, that it is all debased voyeurism? Do these critics know what the word voyeurism means? It is the obtaining of sexual gratification from watching, rather than participating in, the act of copulation. Anyone who managed to achieve mild sexual arousal, let alone full sexual gratification, from watching this television series is seriously in need of help. In the post-eviction interviews, the wildly manic Davina McCall, whipped up by producers into a frenzy of dogged vulgarity, kept demanding that the evictees ditch the dirt on events in the house. She even sank to searching through their garbage bin for condoms, without success. Dirt? Filth? She must be joking. Blue Peter is smuttier than this. As for invasion of privacy, have the critics forgotten that the inmates are all volunteers and that they are free to leave at any time? And with the programme editors forcibly diverting our gaze from all bodily functions there is about as much invasion of privacy as there is with contestants on the Antiques Roadshow. So if it is not serious science and it is not depraved ogling, what is it? At first it was reminiscent of being trapped in a delayed flight at Gatwick. Will these poor stranded people ever hear a Tannoy voice telling them they can leave? Then it seemed more like looking in on the five Spice Girls on tour, stranded in a remote, deserted motel with five of their roadies. Then, when they all became excited by some trivial reward bestowed on them by Big Brother, and they all leapt about giggling and laughing, it was as though they were engaged in a Teletubbies rehearsal, sans costume.

Linda Grant London \u0095 The prime minister has pledged \"strong support for whatever decisons police have to take\" to deal with the blockades. I wonder if his support will be readily forthcoming should Humberside police decide to deploy only the cardboard cut-outs they have been forced to utilise due to the lack of police officers? Clive Chamberlain Dorset Police Federation \u0095 If diesel is so expensive perhaps truck drivers should be taking more care not to slop it all over our roads killing, as they do, hundreds of motorcyclists every year.

The bespoke service provided by the shop in London's Piccadilly is available online, so you choose exactly what goes into the box.

This week's <strong> Battle of Wills</strong> (Channel 4) was about disputes over inheriting a house, usually the major part of an estate. The British were pretty darn decent about it, wounded yet restrained. Not so in Ireland. For nearly 10 years Dublin has been entertained by its own soap opera, The Battling Blackwalls of Blackrock. </p> <p>Rose, Eileen and Gerard Blackwall were left Marino Park in the will of their mother. It is a charming little estate in a rapidly appreciating area. Rose and Eileen want to spend the rest of their lives there. Gerard's widow wants the money. Rose is 82, frail, funny and full of fighting spirit. The Queen Mother could take her correspondence course on how to arrive at court in a wheelchair, waving. She says she was born a fighter, being related to Brian Boru. I am not acquainted with Brian myself but obviously he's a man you can hear coming before he turns the corner by the sound of breaking glass and vainglorious shouting. </p> <p>Gerard was not, like his sisters, a home bird. In old age, he married the pneumatic Iris (\"She used to pose in skimpy undies\" according to scandalised Irish tabloids) and left her everything. Gerard's only son, William, reacted like a true descendant of Brian Boru (\"I went into a field and called him a bastard at the top of my voice.\") Iris dug her hooves in (\"I'm not going to give him anything. There's no way he's getting anything from his father's estate.\") Rose, radiating charm, sued the socks off the lot of them (\"I want what is mine and I refuse to see why someone else should have what is mine. It's very annoying.\") </p> <p>If this story doesn't have everything, then tell me what's missing? Well, apart from seven dwarfs. </p> <p>Rose, William and Iris are friendly and fluent to a delightful degree, though \"stiff,\" \"upper\" and \"lip\" do not seem to feature in their vocabulary. I often feel that journalism must be an easy job anywhere that isn't England. Meanwhile Marino Park is decaying like a bunch of grapes with noble rot. It now looks like a wedding cake left out in the rain. Wisely waiting till Rose was in court, bailiffs evicted Eileen. Iris, installed by the court as a caretaker, perches upstairs among the rafters like a pigeon. The site value has escalated into millions. </p> <p>Rose has fought every millimetre of the way. She says she doesn't want to be a millionaire, though, with a twinkle, she wouldn't mind. She is just determined to die in her own house if it kills her. Personally, I think it's what's keeping her alive. </p> <p>As Dylan, the lethargic rabbit said, yawning, in The Magic Roundabout, \"We're trying to change the image.\" A wholly unfamiliar image of Glasgow emerges from a new series of <strong> Taggart</strong> (ITV). The new producer says \"Glasgow has changed.

      "bodyText": "Neon, 71 Atlantic Road, London SW9. Tel: 020-7738 6576. Once the feared front line, Atlantic Road is now fearlessly fashionable. Neon is up there with the happily hippest - huge red windows and stark interior - serving such dainty delicacies as pizzas, focaccias and home-made ravioli with spinach, ricotta and walnut sauce (\u00a37-10 as a main course, \u00a34 as a first). If that doesn't get your taste buds sitting up and begging, try the meatloaf stuffed with veg at only \u00a37.40. Menu changes constantly. Tasting menu on Sundays; each dish \u00a31. You can keep an eye on the kitchen on a small CCTV at the entrance. The atmosphere is genial and favoured by Brixton's fearsome media and arts mob. But wait a couple of weeks; they're fixing the kitchen. Lounge, 38 Atlantic Road, London SW9. Tel: 020-7733 5229. Comrade in culinary revolution, though a tad more laid back on the fashion front. Lounge could hardly be more aptly named, stuffed, as it is, with big, squashy sofas which encourage, well, lounging. Not surprisingly, it appeals more to louche students and self-employed arty types than drug-dealing heavies. Big, fancy sandwiches like goat's cheese with roasted pepper, aubergine and fresh basil for only \u00a32.40; great gooey, sticky cakes; smooth-as-you-like caf\u00e9 au lait, and fresh juices for health seekers, both at \u00a32.

The \"pay up or switch off\" policy is due to Anatoly Chubais, the pugnacious Thatcherite who has run UES for the past two years. \"Chubais is quite serious about his campaign to cut off customers and the government also is slowly accepting the fact that social facilities can be cut off, though it is very sensitive about the military,\" said Hartmut Jakob, a power sector analyst at Renaissance Capital in Moscow. That \"slow acceptance\" let a baby die shortly after birth in a hospital in Vladivostok in the far-east last month when the electricity was cut off. This week armed soldiers from a base of the elite strategic missile forces in Ivanovo, north of Moscow, seized the local power station to reconnect their barracks. The prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, said the disconnections were inadmissible and ordered UES to keep the military connected. The defence ministry was allocated \u00a332m to pay electricity bills. Mr Chubais then banned power cuts to the missile forces, but the news did not seem to penetrate Siberia, where a base in Aleix, near the Chinese, border was warned that it would be cut off next week unless it paid \u00a3125,000.

Two nuclear reactors were closed down, one in Sverdlovsk last week and one in Chelyabinsk this week, because of \"faults in the regional energy system\", though plant managers and the atomic energy ministry denied that Mr Chubais had ordered any power cuts. \"There are two reasons for Chubais's behaviour: he wants to show how important he is and he also badly needs the money because UES has run up enormous debts under his leadership,\" a Moscow expert on the electricity industry, Moysei Gelman, said.

Mr Chubais is keen to publicise military and railway cuts, but less forthcoming about the schools and hospitals. If the tough tactics continue throughout the winter, the public will suffer. \"Cuts in the social sector are not a large-scale phenomenon, but they're happening now, whereas before the authorities did not allow that to happen,\" Mr Jakob said. \"They're becoming much more widespread.\"",

      "bodyText": "Japanese police were ordered yesterday to start naming and shaming gangsters in a new attempt to crack down on the crime syndicates that are steadily infiltrating the mainstream business world. Names, addresses and mob affiliations will be made public under the new policy, which was described by one lawyer as an attempt to force the gangsters - the yakuza - to show their tell-tale tattoos to society. The national police agency said the exposure was necessary because crime syndicates were becoming harder to identify as they shifted their operations into the realm of conventional business. At first sight, the plan to \"out\" the gangsters seems absurd: in their habitual garb, the yakuza are the peacocks of Japanese society, impossible to miss. They perm their hair, dress in Hawaiian shirts, and drive huge Mercedes cars through narrow streets. Their chests and backs are often covered in tattoos of mythical beasts, visible at public bathhouses and when they strip to the waist at Shinto festivals. If that is not enough of a giveaway, many lack a finger or two because the yakuza code requires a mobster to lop off a digit as a sign of contrition if he makes a mistake. But these ostentatious markings are being shunned by a new generation of gang members who wear Armani suits rather than kimonos and fleece big corporations rather than run brothels, drug rings and protection rackets. The change is largely a result of a 1994 law that restricted the activities of crime syndicates and made members liable for arrest for wearing syndicate lapel pins or passing out syndicate business cards. But Japan's continuing economic depression has made financial institutions vulnerable to the schemes of smart young yakuza, many educated at Japan's top universities. \"More and more crime syndicates are stealthily moving into new areas of society and business,\" said a police agency spokesman. \"We have introduced the exposure policy in response to a growing demand for information from groups worried about such activities.\" The police have identified 83,100 people in Japan who have close connections with criminal organisations; the 1998 figure was 81,300. Every police station in Japan has a list of local gangsters. This information, which was supposed to be kept secret to protect the privacy of individuals, has increasingly been leaked to private screening agencies. Under the new guidelines issued yesterday, police officers will be able to release limited data - excluding photographs and criminal records - on individual mobsters and on the location and activities of crime syndicates. The national police agency said disclosure would help financial institutions confirm whether potential borrowers have links with gangsters. The information would also go to firms doing debt collection and waste disposal, where syndicates are banned. \"This is what we have wanted for years,\" Naoguki Fukasawa, who heads an anti-gangsterism committee of the Japan federation of bar associations, said. \"The mobsters will no longer be able to hide behind privacy laws.

At the Tokyo headquarters of the Inagawa-kai, Japan's third biggest crime syndicate, the burly office chief boasted that it would make no difference. \"I'm proud of being a yakuza.

      "body": "<p>When the disgraced Irish prime minister, Charles Haughey, was brought down by a string of scandals, the country's business community caught the backlash. During subsequent investigations more than 100 prominent businessmen featured in allegations that they used offshore accounts to avoid paying Ir\u00a3100m (\u00a381m) in tax. Many leading Irish companies have been viewed with suspicion ever since. </p> <p>In Germany, police are investigating more than 2,000 corruption cases a year, many of them linking politicians and industry leaders. Those whose reputations have been tainted include Gerhard Glogowski, forced to resign as the Social Democrat premier of Lower Saxony. Helmut Kohl, president from 1982 until 1998, has been castigated for flouting the party finance laws he enacted. </p> <p>Put together, these stories paint a grubby picture. But is this fair? </p> <p>The answer, according to Transparency International which examines these issues on a daily basis, is an emphatic \"yes\". Its Corruption Perceptions Index, which defines the problem as \"the abuse of public office for private gain\", ranks 90 countries in terms of the degree of corruption that is believed to exist among public officials and politicians. </p> <p>\"Corruption in government is rampant in dozens of countries,\" says this year's report, just published. \"Global corruption has impoverished the third world - through cartels, transfer pricing and restraints of all description as well as through more conventional bribery and corruption.\" </p> <p>The situation is so bad that corruption has become a \"very real threat to the emerging democracies\", although much of the blame is levelled at outside investors. It says many international companies are using bribes as an everyday business tool and are only too willing to risk their reputations by making payments to officials responsible for allocating contracts. \"The propensity to pay foreign bribes by major international firms, we believe, remains high.\" </p> <p>Laurence Cockcroft, chairman of Transparency International UK, wants the British government to establish a code of practice for companies with dealings abroad. Although refusing requests for bribes might mean the loss of one or two contracts, he says, a company's long term reputation will be much more valuable. </p> <p>\"There's increasing recognition that a code of practice needs to be developed and there should be a compliance system.\" </p> <p>Mr Cockcroft said around $150bn of outside aid was received by countries which were thought to be the most corrupt in the world. TI rates Nigeria the country perceived to be the most corrupt, followed by Yugoslavia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Angola and Indonesia. Nigeria's title, inherited from Cameroon, will be depressing news for its president, Olusegun Obasanjo, who has pursued an anti-corruption agenda. </p> <p>He now has powers to halt dubious contracts and investigate sleazy politicians but success depends on levels of political and economic stability. He also has the weight of history pressing on him. In July, the Nigerian government formally asked Britain to freeze the bank accounts of the late dictator General Sani Abacha, who is alleged to have stolen $4.3bn during his five years in office from 1993. </p> <p>Authorities believe that up to $450m was deposited by Abacha, his family and associates in leading London banks. A panel set up by the new government following Abacha's death in 1998 recovered $1bn from accounts he held jointly with an aide and a London-based Nigerian businessman. </p> <p>Authors of the index admit some countries - Pakistan, Angola and Nicaragua - are not included because there was insufficient data available, even though they are known to have problems. </p> <p>Last month the Pakistan military government sought the help of British authorities trackdown 14 former officials and businessmen, believed to be living in Britain, as part of a corruption inquiry. </p> <p>Money laundering in Israel is said to have reached colossal proportions due to the rise of organised crime following the collapse of the Soviet Union. </p> <p>Closer to home, the worst offenders are named as Ireland, Germany and Italy, which is said to have an \"abysmal\" record. </p> <p>\"The regional table for western Europe shows that an initiative against corruption in Europe is long overdue,\" TI says. </p> <p>The biggest post-war corruption scandal in France centred on the state-owned oil company Elf, which is alleged to have spent around \u00a340m a year in bribes. Andre Tarallo, who used to manage the company's African affairs, has told an inquiry the money was spent on buying influence from foreign and domestic politicians. Most of the money, he claimed, went to Gabon, followed by Angola, Nigeria, Congo and Cameroon. </p> <p>But there are at least a few places where corruption is barely a problem. The cleanest country in the TI survey was Finland, followed by Denmark, New Zealand, Sweden and Canada. Britain came in 10th, a slight improvement on last year. <br> <strong>Shamed states:</strong> <br> </p> <p><strong> Most corrupt</strong> </p> <p>1. Nigeria </p> <p>2. Yugoslavia </p> <p>3.

      "bodyText": "When the disgraced Irish prime minister, Charles Haughey, was brought down by a string of scandals, the country's business community caught the backlash. During subsequent investigations more than 100 prominent businessmen featured in allegations that they used offshore accounts to avoid paying Ir\u00a3100m (\u00a381m) in tax. Many leading Irish companies have been viewed with suspicion ever since. In Germany, police are investigating more than 2,000 corruption cases a year, many of them linking politicians and industry leaders. Those whose reputations have been tainted include Gerhard Glogowski, forced to resign as the Social Democrat premier of Lower Saxony. Helmut Kohl, president from 1982 until 1998, has been castigated for flouting the party finance laws he enacted. Put together, these stories paint a grubby picture. But is this fair? The answer, according to Transparency International which examines these issues on a daily basis, is an emphatic \"yes\". Its Corruption Perceptions Index, which defines the problem as \"the abuse of public office for private gain\", ranks 90 countries in terms of the degree of corruption that is believed to exist among public officials and politicians. \"Corruption in government is rampant in dozens of countries,\" says this year's report, just published. \"Global corruption has impoverished the third world - through cartels, transfer pricing and restraints of all description as well as through more conventional bribery and corruption.\" The situation is so bad that corruption has become a \"very real threat to the emerging democracies\", although much of the blame is levelled at outside investors. It says many international companies are using bribes as an everyday business tool and are only too willing to risk their reputations by making payments to officials responsible for allocating contracts. \"The propensity to pay foreign bribes by major international firms, we believe, remains high.\" Laurence Cockcroft, chairman of Transparency International UK, wants the British government to establish a code of practice for companies with dealings abroad. Although refusing requests for bribes might mean the loss of one or two contracts, he says, a company's long term reputation will be much more valuable. \"There's increasing recognition that a code of practice needs to be developed and there should be a compliance system.\" Mr Cockcroft said around $150bn of outside aid was received by countries which were thought to be the most corrupt in the world. TI rates Nigeria the country perceived to be the most corrupt, followed by Yugoslavia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Angola and Indonesia. Nigeria's title, inherited from Cameroon, will be depressing news for its president, Olusegun Obasanjo, who has pursued an anti-corruption agenda. He now has powers to halt dubious contracts and investigate sleazy politicians but success depends on levels of political and economic stability. He also has the weight of history pressing on him. In July, the Nigerian government formally asked Britain to freeze the bank accounts of the late dictator General Sani Abacha, who is alleged to have stolen $4.3bn during his five years in office from 1993. Authorities believe that up to $450m was deposited by Abacha, his family and associates in leading London banks. A panel set up by the new government following Abacha's death in 1998 recovered $1bn from accounts he held jointly with an aide and a London-based Nigerian businessman. Authors of the index admit some countries - Pakistan, Angola and Nicaragua - are not included because there was insufficient data available, even though they are known to have problems. Last month the Pakistan military government sought the help of British authorities trackdown 14 former officials and businessmen, believed to be living in Britain, as part of a corruption inquiry. Money laundering in Israel is said to have reached colossal proportions due to the rise of organised crime following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Closer to home, the worst offenders are named as Ireland, Germany and Italy, which is said to have an \"abysmal\" record. \"The regional table for western Europe shows that an initiative against corruption in Europe is long overdue,\" TI says. The biggest post-war corruption scandal in France centred on the state-owned oil company Elf, which is alleged to have spent around \u00a340m a year in bribes. Andre Tarallo, who used to manage the company's African affairs, has told an inquiry the money was spent on buying influence from foreign and domestic politicians. Most of the money, he claimed, went to Gabon, followed by Angola, Nigeria, Congo and Cameroon. But there are at least a few places where corruption is barely a problem. The cleanest country in the TI survey was Finland, followed by Denmark, New Zealand, Sweden and Canada. Britain came in 10th, a slight improvement on last year. Shamed states: Most corrupt 1. Nigeria 2. Yugoslavia 3. Ukraine/Azerbaijan 5. Angola/Indonesia Cleanest 1. Finland 2. Denmark 3. New Zealand/Sweden 5. Canada ... 10. United Kingdom",

Thus did Turrentine, who had begun on cello, make a fast start in the business.

His sound was drawn from a mixture of influences, including the big-toned, 1930s swing-sax masters Coleman Hawkins and Don Byas, and the more fragmented, melodically wayward methods of Sonny Rollins.</p> <p>Following early 50s r&amp;b tours with Ray Charles, Turrentine replaced the young John Coltrane in Earl Bostic's earthy, early-fusion ensembles. In the later 50s, he worked with Max Roach - after Sonny Rollins's departure for solo performance - and both Stanley and Tommy Turrentine meshed with the drummer's complex developments of bebop in ways that reflected both their broad, freewheeling lyricism and a melodic ingenuity that was not always taxed by Stanley's career choices later.</p> <p>The saxophonist became a staple performer for Blue Note Records from 1960 on, when the label was a natural home for younger hard-bop performers with open minds about gospel and funk influences. He frequently worked with the Hammond organists Jimmy Smith and another Pennsylvanian, Shirley Scott, to whom the saxophonist was married until 1971.</p> <p>Scott's and Turrentine's collaborations - on such recordings as The Soul Is Willing and Soul Shoutin' - were striking examples of the power of the Hammond-tenor blend, Turrentine's controlled ferocity complementing his wife's deft, economical swing. Such succinct and eloquent solo performances as his exquisite God Bless The Child, from the Never Let Me Go album, also testified to his lyricism given the chance to explore it.</p> <p>In the 1970s, after Blue Note, Turrentine recorded indifferent fusion material, often with hackneyed pop-jazz arrangements for larger groups, but began working with Jimmy Smith again in the 1980s, returning to straight-ahead jazz with the resurgence of classic forms of the idiom in the 1990s.</p> <p>Turrentine gigs in these later years were frequently familiar explorations of the art of standards-playing, and in fleeting moments - like his humming, muttering decorations around the main theme of Just In Time, and the hooting soul-sax fills on My Foolish Heart, on a 1998 Jazz Cafe show - hinted that he had forgotten more about melodic improvisation than most saxophonists can remember.</p> <p>Turrentine downplayed this side of himself for much of his career, but he also whetted the appetite of the potential listenership for the music closest to his heart.</p> <p><b> Stanley Turrentine, saxophonist, born April 5 1934; died September 12 2000 </b></p>",

David O Russell's movie plays fast and loose with war-movie traditions and skilfully juggles an exciting, dynamically edited action movie, a cynical screwball comedy and a coherent indictment of US foreign policy under Bush Sr.</p> <p> It juxtaposes the realistic and the bizarre with bravado: when Mark Wahlberg is being tortured, his oppressor keeps asking: \"What is the problem with Michael Jackson?\" (his lightened skin was seen as endemic of US racism - like the burning oilfields and oil-damaged birds seen here, it all seems a long time ago). Wahlberg is one of the \"three kings\" hunting gold Saddam stole from Kuwait. The others are George Clooney - continuing the smoothest TV-to-film star transfer since Woody Harrelson - and Ice Cube.</p> <p> The greedy trio are gradually and reluctantly involved in the politics around them. Any heroics they achieve are by opposing American policy, explained by Clooney as: \"Bush told the people to rise up against Saddam. They thought they'd have our support. They don't. They're being slaughtered.\" A rather pat ending apart, Three Kings is spot on and memorable. </p> <p><strong> Lake Placid</strong><br> Rental and DVD rental<br> Fox Path\u00e9 Cert 15 <br> ** <br> </p> <p> A monster movie that concentrates more on its characters than a rather unconvincing 30ft croc. It aims for quirky, and it's written by king quirk David E Kelley, the impossibly prolific Ally McBeal man. I was hoping for something like Arachnophobia or Tremors, but they worked by taking the genre seriously at the same time as subverting it. Lake Placid is too trite for that, with Bridget Fonda's parody New Yorker in the sticks taking centre stage, and its main joke is casting Betty White, the prissy one in The Golden Girls, as a foul-mouthed croc-feeder. </p> <p><strong> Ordinary Decent Criminal</strong><br> Rental and DVD (\u00a315.99)<br> Warner, Cert 15 <br> ** <br> </p> <p> Not a bad trawl through the life of Martin Cahill if you haven't seen John Boorman's The General made just two years ago; rather a redundant retread for those who have. Where Brendan Gleeson made Dublin's most famous felon a bumpy, unpredictable character, Kevin Spacey's rogue gang-leader (called Michael Lynch) is just a smoothly superior robber effortlessly and consistently outwitting the police at every turn.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Three Kings Rental and DVD (\u00a319.99) Warner Cert 15 **** \"Are we shooting people or what?\" For a moment, you wonder if this is a film within a film, but Three Kings pitches you into the chaos of Desert Storm with its first line, which leads to random death for some distant \"towelhead\". David O Russell's movie plays fast and loose with war-movie traditions and skilfully juggles an exciting, dynamically edited action movie, a cynical screwball comedy and a coherent indictment of US foreign policy under Bush Sr. It juxtaposes the realistic and the bizarre with bravado: when Mark Wahlberg is being tortured, his oppressor keeps asking: \"What is the problem with Michael Jackson?\" (his lightened skin was seen as endemic of US racism - like the burning oilfields and oil-damaged birds seen here, it all seems a long time ago). Wahlberg is one of the \"three kings\" hunting gold Saddam stole from Kuwait. The others are George Clooney - continuing the smoothest TV-to-film star transfer since Woody Harrelson - and Ice Cube. The greedy trio are gradually and reluctantly involved in the politics around them. Any heroics they achieve are by opposing American policy, explained by Clooney as: \"Bush told the people to rise up against Saddam. They thought they'd have our support. They don't. They're being slaughtered.\" A rather pat ending apart, Three Kings is spot on and memorable. Lake Placid Rental and DVD rental Fox Path\u00e9 Cert 15 ** A monster movie that concentrates more on its characters than a rather unconvincing 30ft croc. It aims for quirky, and it's written by king quirk David E Kelley, the impossibly prolific Ally McBeal man. I was hoping for something like Arachnophobia or Tremors, but they worked by taking the genre seriously at the same time as subverting it. Lake Placid is too trite for that, with Bridget Fonda's parody New Yorker in the sticks taking centre stage, and its main joke is casting Betty White, the prissy one in The Golden Girls, as a foul-mouthed croc-feeder. Ordinary Decent Criminal Rental and DVD (\u00a315.99) Warner, Cert 15 ** Not a bad trawl through the life of Martin Cahill if you haven't seen John Boorman's The General made just two years ago; rather a redundant retread for those who have. Where Brendan Gleeson made Dublin's most famous felon a bumpy, unpredictable character, Kevin Spacey's rogue gang-leader (called Michael Lynch) is just a smoothly superior robber effortlessly and consistently outwitting the police at every turn.",

      "byline": "Interview by Peter Lennon",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Abbas Kiarostami has taken up two daunting challenges. First, the Iranian director, increasingly acknowledged as one of the most original film-makers working today, wants to preserve cinema's visual purity in the face of the current pyrotechnic overload. Second, he wants to give to cinema the advantage of the novel where the reader-spectator willingly visualises what is not actually shown. Before this is dismissed as grandiose bombast, it is worth pointing out that he has already achieved it - notably in Close-Up (1990), Through the Olive Trees (1994), Taste of Cherry (1996) and now The Wind Will Carry Us. </p> <p>Kiarostami's spectators are tamed into a degree of submission where they have to fill in visual (and even factual) gaps as audiences used to do for storytelling of old. It is a reaction against modern cinema's giddy infatuation with showing everything. His answer is to show less; tell less, and still mesmerise the viewer. </p> <p>So the ending of Through the Olive Trees concentrates uniquely on the protracted efforts of a young, illiterate peasant to get a sign from a young educated girl, orphaned by an earthquake, that she accepts his proposal of marriage. She walks off down a hill and across an immense valley. When she is in danger of disappearing into the distance, the boy runs after her, closing on her until he in turn almost disappears. </p> <p>By now we are hypnotised by these two distant dots, urgently needing to spot the signal which will satisfy our curiosity. Suddenly one of the dots - the boy - turns and begins to run back towards us; running, running. We are now focused on only one thing: the coming glimpse of this approaching face which will reveal the boy's state of mind. Before the dot becomes a face, the film ends. </p> <p>We have been conned, we realise, into watching two specks on the screen for minutes on end. At this point, the witlessly overweighted techniques of modern commercial film-makers, their work cacophonous with bullying detail, collapse into absurdity before the skill of a director who can keep us as spellbound as Hitchcock could, only watching two dots. This is mastery of suspense without violence; human feeling is the motor. Also, you cannot rid yourself of the film immediately: the mind still churns with the necessity of reliving the scene to look for clues. Kiarostami has it both ways: his way of showing less is to place less in a ravishing framework. Those radiant hills and olive groves are worth watching for themselves. </p> <p>In his latest film, The Wind Will Carry Us, there is a subplot of the courtship between a youth we never see - he is digging a deep well - and a young girl milking a cow in the dark whose face is constantly averted. (The Iranian religious censors, deeply suspicious that there might be something erotic here, have not yet given permission for the film to be released in Iran.) </p> <p>But cute variations on courtship are by no means the limit of Kiarostami's achievements; he also knows how to send up dependence on modern technology. There is, literally, a running joke involving the chief character in The Wind Willl Carry Us. He has come to a village in Iranian Kurdistan to record mourning rituals. But every time Tehran calls him on his mobile he has to dash, panting, to his car and rattle up the hills to get adequate reception. Meanwhile life and death in the village carry on at their own traditional pace. </p> <p>On his way home from serving on the jury of the Montreal film festival, Abbas Kiarostami stopped off in Paris last week where we met under the giant limbs of the Eiffel tower. The city's normal hubbub was upped a considerable few decibels by 3,000 taxi drivers hooting in a snail-crawl fuel price protest along the boulevards. The only rural landscape I could offer this teller of rural tales was to get him in amongst the shrubbery of the tower's garden. </p> <p>He is short, dark, quiet, courteous and candid. The one suggestion of vanity is a refusal to remove the dark glasses when being photographed: \"Nobody would know me without them,\" he explains. </p> <p>\"Whenever I get the opportunity,\" he says. \"I like to provide for film the advantage of literature. The usual way in film is to show something. But my aim is to create a cinema to see how much we can do without actually showing it. How much use we can make of the imagination of the spectator. </p> <p>\"You must be able to imagine what is going on beyond what is physically shown, because you are actually only showing a corner of reality. It is a good idea when pictures and action guide you to something which is outside the story without actually showing it.\" </p> <p>In Taste of Cherry, which won Cannes' Palme d'Or in 1997, a man drives around, trawling for someone who will help him commit suicide. None of his passengers asks why he wants to commit suicide. </p> <p>He clearly left that question out on purpose. \"So that everybody could have their own answer,\" he says. \"Allowing them to project their own difficulties and feel how it translates into their own daily lives. A lady in New York said: 'I am absolutely confident that the man was in love!' I am sure the lady herself was in love. And a businessman said: 'I think he was bankrupt.' I am certain he had financial problems. </p> <p>\"You see, when you have made a statement, you have only made that statement. But if you don't make any one statement you have all the others.\" </p> <p>Directors have occasionally attempted to use this kind of austere ambiguity - notably Antonioni in L'Avventura. But that was manifestly an intellectual exercise. Here we have ambiguity and reticence at the service of wonderful, humane storytelling. </p> <p>Kiarostami, who has just turned 60, began as graphic artist designing feature film titles. While working as a clerk in a police station, he enrolled in a fine arts school. In 1969, with a friend, he founded the Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults. This eventually developed into the prestigious Iranian film studio which has produced, among others, Jafar Panahi, who last week won the Golden Lion at Venice. He began making short television films for children. Growing up in the Shah's Persia, there were two cinematic influences: American films \"which were far from our way of life, and the Italian neo-realists - De Sica and Rossellini - who were nearer\". This was the style he developed from. </p> <p>He and his wife, a designer, divorced 20 years ago; he has two grown sons, one in computers, another making publicity films. Although on his 10th feature and with increasing international fame, nothing is made easy for him. The story of the making of The Wind Will Carry Us underlines this. Even his film crew abandoned him. </p> <p>\"The conditions were very bad,\" Kiarostami said. \"The flies were terrible and some of the people lived with their cattle. We had to spend a huge sum of money - \u00a310,000 - disinfecting the houses with DDT. A film crew is used to comfort, but we had very little hot water and they didn't even have a pretty face to look at. I have refused to use artificial light for my last four films and the main problem was that Iranian crews don't work in the morning. But since the light goes quickly I needed them up at six in the morning. In the end they went off and I was left with my sound man and assistant cameraman to finish the film.\" </p> <p>In the village where they were shooting there is an ancient mourning ritual by which women cut their faces to express sympathy with a bereaved person. Women have been known to do this even when their husband's boss has a bereavement to ensure their husbands or sons keep their jobs. I assume that portraying women so debased by their economic circumstances that they would mutilate themselves in the hope of security must have been one of the points which angered the censors? </p> <p>\"For the past 20 years,\" says Kiarostami, \"the religious censors have unfortunately shown they do not pay any attention to economic problems. They were more sensitive about undermining religious ideas.\" </p> <p>One of the scenes the censors are creating problems with involves the young girl, who is milking the cow while the visitor from Tehran quotes from the love poem that gave Kiarostami his title - The Wind Will Carry Us, by Forugh Farrokhzad. A revolutionary poet, one of the first to deal with women's problems and explicitly with sex, Farrokhzad died in a car crash in 1967, aged 33. The censors also do not approve of the quotation from the celebrated 12th century Persian poem, the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. The verse runs: </p> <p>\" Some for the Glories of This World; and some<br> </p> <p>Sigh for the Prophet's Paradise to come; <br></p> <p>Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go, <br></p> <p>Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum! \" <br></p> <p>How does he deal with the censors? \"By being patient,\" says Kiarostami. \"An Iranian official hardly ever remains in his position a very long time. When one goes and another comes, that is the best time to try again.\" </p> <p> Last year the UN asked Kiarostami to make a documentary on the plight of Ugandan children whose parents have died or are dying of Aids. \"I wondered at first why they had chosen me,\" he said, \"but of course I spent my first 20 years making films for children at the Tehran institute.\" </p> <p>He discovered that Uganda was not the land of savagery and horrific violence we believe it to be. \"This is potentially a very rich country with a happy and vigorous people,\" he says. \"They are dying, often without knowing what is happening to them. These villages were 200 miles from the nearest town and not only did they not have electricity, they didn't even have oil lamps or candles. So in the long dark nights they have nothing to do but make love, which they do very naturally and without guilt. Some religious groups put up posters urging women to remain virginal and be chaste.\" He laughs. \"Condoms make no impression on them. For them it is normal to undress to make love. They don't understand why you have to put on something to make love. </p> <p>\"What is amazing about these primitive people is how very polite and well-mannered they are. Where does it come from? Once a woman complained about my photographing her and called a policeman. He was the most courteous policeman I have ever met in the world. He was meticulous, made no attempt to undermine the lady's rights and sorted the matter out completely impartially. And he wouldn't accept a bribe, which would be normal in most countries.\" </p> <p>Kiarostami cannot tell me much about his next project, he says, except that he will start shooting this winter and this time it will be about city life. On leaving, I remark to his interpreter (the interview was in Farsi) how curious it is that truly talented people never make difficulties in interviews; it is only those of dubious ability who put up barriers. </p> <p>He replies: \"We have a saying in Iran. 'The fruitful tree bends.' \"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Abbas Kiarostami has taken up two daunting challenges. First, the Iranian director, increasingly acknowledged as one of the most original film-makers working today, wants to preserve cinema's visual purity in the face of the current pyrotechnic overload. Second, he wants to give to cinema the advantage of the novel where the reader-spectator willingly visualises what is not actually shown. Before this is dismissed as grandiose bombast, it is worth pointing out that he has already achieved it - notably in Close-Up (1990), Through the Olive Trees (1994), Taste of Cherry (1996) and now The Wind Will Carry Us. Kiarostami's spectators are tamed into a degree of submission where they have to fill in visual (and even factual) gaps as audiences used to do for storytelling of old. It is a reaction against modern cinema's giddy infatuation with showing everything. His answer is to show less; tell less, and still mesmerise the viewer. So the ending of Through the Olive Trees concentrates uniquely on the protracted efforts of a young, illiterate peasant to get a sign from a young educated girl, orphaned by an earthquake, that she accepts his proposal of marriage. She walks off down a hill and across an immense valley. When she is in danger of disappearing into the distance, the boy runs after her, closing on her until he in turn almost disappears. By now we are hypnotised by these two distant dots, urgently needing to spot the signal which will satisfy our curiosity. Suddenly one of the dots - the boy - turns and begins to run back towards us; running, running. We are now focused on only one thing: the coming glimpse of this approaching face which will reveal the boy's state of mind. Before the dot becomes a face, the film ends. We have been conned, we realise, into watching two specks on the screen for minutes on end. At this point, the witlessly overweighted techniques of modern commercial film-makers, their work cacophonous with bullying detail, collapse into absurdity before the skill of a director who can keep us as spellbound as Hitchcock could, only watching two dots. This is mastery of suspense without violence; human feeling is the motor. Also, you cannot rid yourself of the film immediately: the mind still churns with the necessity of reliving the scene to look for clues. Kiarostami has it both ways: his way of showing less is to place less in a ravishing framework. Those radiant hills and olive groves are worth watching for themselves. In his latest film, The Wind Will Carry Us, there is a subplot of the courtship between a youth we never see - he is digging a deep well - and a young girl milking a cow in the dark whose face is constantly averted. (The Iranian religious censors, deeply suspicious that there might be something erotic here, have not yet given permission for the film to be released in Iran.) But cute variations on courtship are by no means the limit of Kiarostami's achievements; he also knows how to send up dependence on modern technology. There is, literally, a running joke involving the chief character in The Wind Willl Carry Us. He has come to a village in Iranian Kurdistan to record mourning rituals. But every time Tehran calls him on his mobile he has to dash, panting, to his car and rattle up the hills to get adequate reception. Meanwhile life and death in the village carry on at their own traditional pace. On his way home from serving on the jury of the Montreal film festival, Abbas Kiarostami stopped off in Paris last week where we met under the giant limbs of the Eiffel tower. The city's normal hubbub was upped a considerable few decibels by 3,000 taxi drivers hooting in a snail-crawl fuel price protest along the boulevards. The only rural landscape I could offer this teller of rural tales was to get him in amongst the shrubbery of the tower's garden. He is short, dark, quiet, courteous and candid. The one suggestion of vanity is a refusal to remove the dark glasses when being photographed: \"Nobody would know me without them,\" he explains. \"Whenever I get the opportunity,\" he says. \"I like to provide for film the advantage of literature. The usual way in film is to show something. But my aim is to create a cinema to see how much we can do without actually showing it. How much use we can make of the imagination of the spectator. \"You must be able to imagine what is going on beyond what is physically shown, because you are actually only showing a corner of reality. It is a good idea when pictures and action guide you to something which is outside the story without actually showing it.\" In Taste of Cherry, which won Cannes' Palme d'Or in 1997, a man drives around, trawling for someone who will help him commit suicide. None of his passengers asks why he wants to commit suicide. He clearly left that question out on purpose. \"So that everybody could have their own answer,\" he says. \"Allowing them to project their own difficulties and feel how it translates into their own daily lives. A lady in New York said: 'I am absolutely confident that the man was in love!' I am sure the lady herself was in love. And a businessman said: 'I think he was bankrupt.' I am certain he had financial problems. \"You see, when you have made a statement, you have only made that statement. But if you don't make any one statement you have all the others.\" Directors have occasionally attempted to use this kind of austere ambiguity - notably Antonioni in L'Avventura. But that was manifestly an intellectual exercise. Here we have ambiguity and reticence at the service of wonderful, humane storytelling. Kiarostami, who has just turned 60, began as graphic artist designing feature film titles. While working as a clerk in a police station, he enrolled in a fine arts school. In 1969, with a friend, he founded the Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults. This eventually developed into the prestigious Iranian film studio which has produced, among others, Jafar Panahi, who last week won the Golden Lion at Venice. He began making short television films for children. Growing up in the Shah's Persia, there were two cinematic influences: American films \"which were far from our way of life, and the Italian neo-realists - De Sica and Rossellini - who were nearer\". This was the style he developed from. He and his wife, a designer, divorced 20 years ago; he has two grown sons, one in computers, another making publicity films. Although on his 10th feature and with increasing international fame, nothing is made easy for him. The story of the making of The Wind Will Carry Us underlines this. Even his film crew abandoned him. \"The conditions were very bad,\" Kiarostami said. \"The flies were terrible and some of the people lived with their cattle. We had to spend a huge sum of money - \u00a310,000 - disinfecting the houses with DDT. A film crew is used to comfort, but we had very little hot water and they didn't even have a pretty face to look at. I have refused to use artificial light for my last four films and the main problem was that Iranian crews don't work in the morning. But since the light goes quickly I needed them up at six in the morning. In the end they went off and I was left with my sound man and assistant cameraman to finish the film.\" In the village where they were shooting there is an ancient mourning ritual by which women cut their faces to express sympathy with a bereaved person. Women have been known to do this even when their husband's boss has a bereavement to ensure their husbands or sons keep their jobs. I assume that portraying women so debased by their economic circumstances that they would mutilate themselves in the hope of security must have been one of the points which angered the censors? \"For the past 20 years,\" says Kiarostami, \"the religious censors have unfortunately shown they do not pay any attention to economic problems. They were more sensitive about undermining religious ideas.\" One of the scenes the censors are creating problems with involves the young girl, who is milking the cow while the visitor from Tehran quotes from the love poem that gave Kiarostami his title - The Wind Will Carry Us, by Forugh Farrokhzad. A revolutionary poet, one of the first to deal with women's problems and explicitly with sex, Farrokhzad died in a car crash in 1967, aged 33. The censors also do not approve of the quotation from the celebrated 12th century Persian poem, the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. The verse runs: \" Some for the Glories of This World; and some Sigh for the Prophet's Paradise to come; Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go, Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum! \" How does he deal with the censors? \"By being patient,\" says Kiarostami. \"An Iranian official hardly ever remains in his position a very long time. When one goes and another comes, that is the best time to try again.\" Last year the UN asked Kiarostami to make a documentary on the plight of Ugandan children whose parents have died or are dying of Aids. \"I wondered at first why they had chosen me,\" he said, \"but of course I spent my first 20 years making films for children at the Tehran institute.\" He discovered that Uganda was not the land of savagery and horrific violence we believe it to be. \"This is potentially a very rich country with a happy and vigorous people,\" he says. \"They are dying, often without knowing what is happening to them. These villages were 200 miles from the nearest town and not only did they not have electricity, they didn't even have oil lamps or candles. So in the long dark nights they have nothing to do but make love, which they do very naturally and without guilt. Some religious groups put up posters urging women to remain virginal and be chaste.\" He laughs. \"Condoms make no impression on them. For them it is normal to undress to make love. They don't understand why you have to put on something to make love. \"What is amazing about these primitive people is how very polite and well-mannered they are. Where does it come from? Once a woman complained about my photographing her and called a policeman. He was the most courteous policeman I have ever met in the world. He was meticulous, made no attempt to undermine the lady's rights and sorted the matter out completely impartially. And he wouldn't accept a bribe, which would be normal in most countries.\" Kiarostami cannot tell me much about his next project, he says, except that he will start shooting this winter and this time it will be about city life. On leaving, I remark to his interpreter (the interview was in Farsi) how curious it is that truly talented people never make difficulties in interviews; it is only those of dubious ability who put up barriers. He replies: \"We have a saying in Iran. 'The fruitful tree bends.' \"",

Simply: this is a film which is impossible to dislike, and moves with an easy, approachable swing through the bleached and steaming landscape of bluegrass Mississippi, with its ornery confidence men and cracker-barrel politicians. It's a film to tap your feet to, in every sense: not perhaps so easy with some of the brothers' early work, composed as it has been in 5/4 and 7/8 time signatures. </p> <p>George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson play Everett, Pete and Delmar, three sweaty convicts in the South during the Depression, who bust off the chain gang and go on the run. They are looking for the treasure that the smooth-talking Everett assures them he has got hidden, from the job that landed him in jail in the first place. In the course of this hunt, they find treasure of a different sort: in a ramshackle recording studio, the errant trio pass themselves off as The Soggy Bottom Boys and make a blues record, which becomes a smash hit. </p> <p>In his wanderings, Everett assumes a sort of Odyssean status, and the Coens whimsically present their movie as the loosest and most amiable kind of Homeric epic, with - amongst other nudges - our heroes being seduced from their path by Sirens, meeting a sinister Cyclops in the form of the one-eyed Bible-salesman Big Dan Teague (John Goodman) and Everett finally returning to his Penelope in the form of his long-suffering wife Penny (Holly Hunter). And in the Homeric spirit, quite a few of the dramatis personae are blind, or partially blind. </p> <p>But there is a more pressing and relevant form of ancestor worship: screwballmeister Preston Sturges, whose 1942 classic, Sullivan's Travels, was about a director of light comedies, who longs to make a harrowingly earnest \"message\" picture about social injustice called O Brother, Where Art Thou? One of the distinctive successes of the Coens' O Brother is the way it has managed to channel some of the spirit of Sturges in its zany dialogue and galloping pace, also cloning some of the earlier film's defining moments: the old-time religion, the prison farm, the \"church parade\" of convicts watching a movie. The anxiety of influence is felt much more strongly from Sturges than the 3,000-year-old Greek poet. </p> <p>This is far from being George Clooney's first comedy role. In his younger, bigger-haired days, he was a veteran of Roseanne and dozens of unsuccessful sitcom pilots. In this film, he produces a novel, raffish charm as the silver-tongued rogue, and a certain old-fashioned masculine mass and substance, which he wears lightly, but in such a way as to signal unmistakablyhis arrival in the big-screen big league. Here, Clooney manages to combine a little of Clark Gable with a whisper of Cary Grant's early incarnation as a vaudevillian stage comic. </p> <p>As for his supporting men: Tim Blake Nelson gets to sing his own blues numbers (Clooney's voice is dubbed by Dan Tyminski). John Turturro's face is stuck in an expression of baffled disapproval, his jaw twisted round to make his face shaped like a J. Clooney is very much the leader of the pack. </p> <p>But all three find their feet in this baroque, distinctive world, which the Coens devise with such intricate charm. Borges has a short story about a writer whose chef d'oeuvre is a multi-volume encyclopaedia about an imaginary universe; the Coens write one of these every time they make a movie. To take just one of the many flecks and touches: when Clooney can't get hold of a can of Dapper Dan, his preferred brand of hair-cream, he is piqued to be offered another, absurdly called Fop. One of many happy inventions. </p> <p>The only reservation I would maintain about O Brother is that the invocation of Preston Sturges reminds us that, somewhere amidst the wackiness, Sullivan's Travels actually had serious things to say about real poverty and what real film-makers can really do about it. For all its accomplishment, there is nothing in the Coens' film which speaks of this concern. But it is made with marvellous clarity and fluency, and Joel and Ethan Coen attain a comic simplicity that other film-makers can only dream of.</p>",

      "body": "<p> For its sheer effrontery, for its browbeating melodrama and pseudo-tragedy, Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark has to be the most sensationally silly film of the year - as well as the most shallow and crudely manipulative. Everything about it is silly, from the faux naivety and implausibility of its plot to the secret little idiot savant smile on the face of its Victim Heroine played by Bj\u00f6rk - a squeaking, chirruping diva turn sufficient to curdle every carton of milk within a 10-kilometre radius. </p> <p>She plays Selma, the poor Czech immigrant factory worker in small-town America, scrimping every penny to bring up her myopic son by herself and daydreaming ecstatically about the musicals she adores, and the action is regularly interspersed with these fantasy song-and-dance sequences. Bj\u00f6rk's role requires her to be almost blind as well, wearing a pair of coke-bottle lenses that make her eyes look even tinier and piggier than usual. As well as conferring the romance and glamour of disability on this bestselling international recording artist, this conceals her inability or unwillingness to inter-relate in any way whatever with the other actors in the film. </p> <p>Screen acting doesn't get much more dire than this, or at least I really hope not. And there are few films which could aspire, or want to aspire to the extravaganza of unreflective emoting and pain that Lars von Trier cheerfully expects us to endure. </p> <p>Well, no one's doubting the crude determination with which Dogme's own PT Barnum delivers his bizarre incendiary assault on our emotions. But his story appears to have been plagiarised from a 12-year-old's English composition homework. Poor Selma is going blind! And her poor son Gene is going blind as well! And she's going without and saving up money in a tin box for Gene's \"operation\" - but this is stolen from her by a wicked policeman. Confronting him and getting her money back leads to violence and tragedy. On death row, Selma learns that a lawyer can get her off, but martyr that she is, she can't accept his help because his fee happens to be equivalent to the money she needs for Gene's surgery. (The state authorities have for some reason allowed Selma to keep this money, although they believe that she has stolen it from the cop, and that theft is the motive for murder!) </p> <p>So the gruy\u00e8re plot does not stand up to the most cursory inspection. Furthermore, there is the casual haziness about the nature of this eye problem and the necessary remedial \"operation\". There is no discussion whatever of the father of Selma's child - can't he put his hand in his pocket? - and no mention of how Selma got over to the US from Czechoslovakia. With the help of family, perhaps? They, too, are a mystery. </p> <p>But still we haven't reached the peak of this Kilimanjaro of absurdity. For Selma's best friend in the factory is played by Catherine Deneuve, in full Marie Antoinette milkmaid mode, sporting a humble overcoat, a headscarf, and a French accent you could slice a baguette with. What is this haughty patrician exquisite doing here? God only knows. Von Trier appears to have roped them together as if for an art installation. In fact, the opening sequence, in which Bj\u00f6rk and Deneuve are attempting to rehearse an am-dram production of The Sound of Music, is an amusingly surreal moment in its laboured way. But it can't justify the price of admission. And there is nothing in Dancer in the Dark to suggest that Von Trier is all that passionate or even knowledgeable about Hollywood musicals: certainly not in his boringly conceived MTV-choreography sequences. </p> <p>There are obvious points of comparison with Breaking the Waves: the martyr heroine nurturing the flame of her spirit in the midst of reactionary and oppressive forces, the strategic deployment of heart-rending disability. But however chancy Breaking the Waves was, it always had some consistency and believability, due to a luminous performance from Emily Watson, in comparison with which Bj\u00f6rk's ridiculous effort pops like a soap bubble. (Some of the cast return for Dancer; the sinister Udo Kier has a cameo as the doctor and Jean-Marc Barr, who played Jan's mate on the oil rig, is cast here as the factory supervisor - and a very charming and human performance it is too.) </p> <p>In Breaking the Waves, Von Trier displayed not genius, perhaps, but something distinctive and inspired. But in Dancer in the Dark, this talent has degenerated into a kind of cynical showbiz charlatanism. There is something so basically facetious about his film-making: a sense that the whole thing is intended to be nothing more than a grand situationist flourish. Oscar Wilde might have laughed at the death of little Nell; I suspect Von Trier is having a bit of a giggle himself at Selma's fate. It's no more possible to feel sorry for Selma than for any of Damien Hirst's pickled demi-livestock. Maybe Dancer in the Dark would work as a continuous video loop at the Saatchi gallery. In the cinema, there are more exacting standards. </p>",
