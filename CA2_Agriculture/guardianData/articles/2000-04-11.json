Meanwhile two of her male colleagues are trying to break down a joyriding UDA messenger in the hope he will implicate the terrorist next door.

Reactionary males in the RUC close ranks against high flying women like Caroline. The dominant male ethos even leads to a curious unspoken complicity between cop and criminal.

One of the tragedies of Northern Ireland, Mitchell implies, is that it is made up of equally entrenched groups all sustaining each other. </p> <p>What is most striking, however, is the way it keeps subverting our moral certainties. It is not simply about a lone woman battling against a pervasive male ethos: at times the heroine's interrogation technique looks suspect. And, even though the play attacks tribal codes, Mitchell shows that the RUC's protection of its own has positive as well as negative implications. It is also chillingly well acted in Robert Delamere's bowstring-tight production.

But put the same money into government bonds and take the annual income - and see your investment shrivel to just \u00a31 a century later. Yesterday Barclays Capital unveiled its annual review of investment returns and again gave succour to equity salespeople across the City. The figures show that buying equities is almost a no-brainer: only during price deflation in the 1920s and 1930s was it a better idea to buy gilts, and even then they only marginally outperformed equities. In the two decades of the 20th century when shares lost money - the 1910s and the 1970s - gilts lost even more. The headline figures show \u00a3100 invested on January 1, 1900 was worth \u00a31.28m by the end of 1999. Stripping out inflation, the \u00a3100 became \u00a324,962. Gilts managed a miserable \u00a314,054, or \u00a3273 after inflation, and \u00a31 after reinvested income is taken out of the equation. The analysis accompanying the data promises another good 10 years for equities, with technology boosting economic efficiency and keeping inflation low. Added to that is the increasing numbers of 35- to 55-year-olds in the US and Europe who, Barclays Capital says, are not only the mostly productive segment of the population but also save lots of money for their pensions, fuelling demand for equities. After that it all becomes a lot murkier.

      "body": "<p>The late Ronnie Scott may not have opted for the kind of rigorous haircut the British saxophonist Dave O'Higgins has just exposed himself to (at least until nature left him no choice) but in some ways there's a resemblance between them. </p> <p>Like Scott, O'Higgins was a teenage sax hero, one of the quick-witted young celebrities of the British jazz upswing of the late 80s that produced Courtney Pine, Andy Sheppard, Tommy Smith and many others. Like Scott, he has a feeling for both relaxed swing and romantic lyricism, he keeps his statements succinct, and he's a natural improviser.

Like Scott, O'Higgins was a teenage sax hero, one of the quick-witted young celebrities of the British jazz upswing of the late 80s that produced Courtney Pine, Andy Sheppard, Tommy Smith and many others. Like Scott, he has a feeling for both relaxed swing and romantic lyricism, he keeps his statements succinct, and he's a natural improviser.

      "byline": "Harry Pearson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Lenny Bruce used to say that tragedy plus time equalled comedy. A similar formula might be proposed for sport. Here a villain can be turned into a beloved elder statesman simply by the addition of a decade or two. Such at least might be the conclusion of anyone comparing last week's respectful media coverage of Bobby Robson's preparations for the FA Cup semi-final with the jeering that greeted the same man's every utterance 10 years ago when he was England manager. </p> <p>In any other walk of life transforming yourself from the desert prat into a wily old fox would require some extraordinary reversal of fortune - or death. </p> <p>Sport, however, is different. The Newcastle manager has simply waited, confident, perhaps, that sooner or later time's wing\u00e9d chariot (recently passed fit for racing by the FIA, incidentally, after some initial problems with the width of the aerofoil) would eventually drop him off at the stop marked \"National Treasure\". </p> <p>Where once Robson pronouncements such as \"I want Bryan Robson to be Bryan Robson because that's the only Bryan Robson I want\" and \"I would have given my right arm to be a concert pianist\" were derided as a sign that his mental acuity was not sharp enough, now they are met with indulgent smiles. </p> <p>Not that I begrudge the Newcastle manager this upturn in respect in any way, I have always liked Robson, even during the dark days of Euro 88 when the only soft spot most people had for him was a patch of quicksand on Romney Marsh. Partly this is down to regional bias, but mainly it is because of his obvious enthusiasm for football. </p> <p>And then, of course, there was his celebration of David Platt's winning goal against Belgium. This saw the then England supremo execute an exuberant hip-swinging rumba while simultaneously buttoning up his blazer, a combination of actions that to my mind sums up the contradictions of modern England more completely than any amount of Britart ever could. </p> <p>It is possible, I suppose, that as a coach Bobby Robson has improved markedly since England's 1-1 draw with Tunisia in June 1990 led some tabloids to call for the team to withdraw from the forthcoming World Cup to spare us further embarrassment, but it seems unlikely. Robson was a good manager then and he is a good manager now. All that has changed is his age. </p> <p>Clearly it helps that the former Ipswich boss is no longer in charge of the national team, a role that would dent even the popularity of Del-Boy Trotter, but it is not exclusively that. Brian Clough never managed England.

      "bodyText": "Lenny Bruce used to say that tragedy plus time equalled comedy. A similar formula might be proposed for sport. Here a villain can be turned into a beloved elder statesman simply by the addition of a decade or two. Such at least might be the conclusion of anyone comparing last week's respectful media coverage of Bobby Robson's preparations for the FA Cup semi-final with the jeering that greeted the same man's every utterance 10 years ago when he was England manager. In any other walk of life transforming yourself from the desert prat into a wily old fox would require some extraordinary reversal of fortune - or death. Sport, however, is different. The Newcastle manager has simply waited, confident, perhaps, that sooner or later time's wing\u00e9d chariot (recently passed fit for racing by the FIA, incidentally, after some initial problems with the width of the aerofoil) would eventually drop him off at the stop marked \"National Treasure\". Where once Robson pronouncements such as \"I want Bryan Robson to be Bryan Robson because that's the only Bryan Robson I want\" and \"I would have given my right arm to be a concert pianist\" were derided as a sign that his mental acuity was not sharp enough, now they are met with indulgent smiles. Not that I begrudge the Newcastle manager this upturn in respect in any way, I have always liked Robson, even during the dark days of Euro 88 when the only soft spot most people had for him was a patch of quicksand on Romney Marsh. Partly this is down to regional bias, but mainly it is because of his obvious enthusiasm for football. And then, of course, there was his celebration of David Platt's winning goal against Belgium. This saw the then England supremo execute an exuberant hip-swinging rumba while simultaneously buttoning up his blazer, a combination of actions that to my mind sums up the contradictions of modern England more completely than any amount of Britart ever could. It is possible, I suppose, that as a coach Bobby Robson has improved markedly since England's 1-1 draw with Tunisia in June 1990 led some tabloids to call for the team to withdraw from the forthcoming World Cup to spare us further embarrassment, but it seems unlikely. Robson was a good manager then and he is a good manager now. All that has changed is his age. Clearly it helps that the former Ipswich boss is no longer in charge of the national team, a role that would dent even the popularity of Del-Boy Trotter, but it is not exclusively that. Brian Clough never managed England. Yet passage through the veil of tears has buffed his image up a treat. Twenty-five years ago Old Big 'Ead's appearances on our TV screens were the cue for dogs to hide under tables, flying confectionery and yells of \"put a sock in it, big mouth\". Nowadays, by contrast, it is a signal for married couples across the land to grin fondly and slide closer together on the sofa. Ray Wilkins might also serve as an example.

      "bodyText": "Leonardo DiCaprio is to star in a film which will be partially shot in the palace of Romania's former dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu. Librium, a science-fiction epic set in the year 2070, will use the enormous People's House in Bucharest, which, when it was built by Ceausescu, was second in size among government buildings only to the Pentagon. It now houses Romania's parliament and other official institutions. An earlier request by Miramax to use the building had been turned down on the grounds that it invoked \"possible image prejudices\". Liberal Party politician Andrei Chiliman explained that those who had voted against the project suffered from \"pyschological blockages\" connected with the extravagant building and the gross excesses of its former occupants, who were overthrown in the anti-communist revolution in December 1989. Chiliman said he hoped that its use in a Hollywood movie would both attract tourists to the country and diminish its painful associations for many Romanians. Filming in and around Bucharest will begin in August.",

It seems inconceivable that Cronje, who seemed to have it all - acclaim, status, a winning team, a strict faith and set of principles to live his life by - would throw it all away for a few rand. And if he of all people can, then cricket is in trouble. </p> <p>Though the protracted match-fixing trial against Bruce Grobbelaar and Hans Segers (in which they were found not guilty) didn't prevent the huge football boom which occurred in the 90s, cricket is more vulnerable. Despite the widespread rumours of illegal betting and fixing in cricket, no-one, until now, had ever been brought to book. Most people just closed their eyes and hoped it wasn't true. England might have lost most matches but at least they were losing fair and square. </p> <p>Now the whole horrid hornets' nest is alive and biting. A good thing, of course, if cricket cleans up once and for all, but devastating to those like the ECB trying to attract new audiences. Women are not the only ones who will be disillusioned by the allegations. Of course not. But cricket cannot afford to lose even a tiny proportion of its female audience. For all the ECB's statistics about more and more girls playing Kwik Cricket, women are only conspicuous by their absence at most grounds. And sometimes with good reason. As Sandy Warr put it in the Observer: \"Most women who go to [cricket] matches on their own know there are certain areas of the ground you avoid after lunch unless you're the type who likes wandering into a pub in the middle of a stag night.\"</p> <p>No doubt cricket will sort itself out, and women will be made just as welcome as men at places like Edgbaston. Cronje's resignation and the subsequent repercussions will be a lot harder to recover from. Desperate stuff.</p> <p>\u0095 Following <a href=\"http://www.wisden.com/Story_Co_Brand/0,5642,155664,00.html\"> last week's</a> tales of sexism at a recent Wisden dinner, I can report that the 2000 gathering, on Wednesday, passed off without incident and was a lovely evening. The Honourable Artillery Company pulled out all the stops - men in pantaloons, gongs, welsh rarebit. Hearty speeches were rattled off by Christopher Martin-Jenkins and the former cabinet minister Peter Brooke. And the top table was crowded with venerable guests, including Clive Lloyd, Graham Thorpe, WF Deedes and Bob Woolmer. Plus women were served at the bar, though in the best traditions of having your cake and eating it I couldn't tell you if drinks were expensive because I had all mine bought for me.</p> <p><em>Tanya Aldred is assistant editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The allegations of match-rigging that emerged against Hansie Cronje and caused him to be sacked in the early hours of this morning are heartbreaking. It seems inconceivable that Cronje, who seemed to have it all - acclaim, status, a winning team, a strict faith and set of principles to live his life by - would throw it all away for a few rand. And if he of all people can, then cricket is in trouble. Though the protracted match-fixing trial against Bruce Grobbelaar and Hans Segers (in which they were found not guilty) didn't prevent the huge football boom which occurred in the 90s, cricket is more vulnerable. Despite the widespread rumours of illegal betting and fixing in cricket, no-one, until now, had ever been brought to book. Most people just closed their eyes and hoped it wasn't true. England might have lost most matches but at least they were losing fair and square. Now the whole horrid hornets' nest is alive and biting. A good thing, of course, if cricket cleans up once and for all, but devastating to those like the ECB trying to attract new audiences. Women are not the only ones who will be disillusioned by the allegations. Of course not. But cricket cannot afford to lose even a tiny proportion of its female audience. For all the ECB's statistics about more and more girls playing Kwik Cricket, women are only conspicuous by their absence at most grounds. And sometimes with good reason. As Sandy Warr put it in the Observer: \"Most women who go to [cricket] matches on their own know there are certain areas of the ground you avoid after lunch unless you're the type who likes wandering into a pub in the middle of a stag night.\" No doubt cricket will sort itself out, and women will be made just as welcome as men at places like Edgbaston. Cronje's resignation and the subsequent repercussions will be a lot harder to recover from. Desperate stuff. \u0095 Following last week's tales of sexism at a recent Wisden dinner, I can report that the 2000 gathering, on Wednesday, passed off without incident and was a lovely evening. The Honourable Artillery Company pulled out all the stops - men in pantaloons, gongs, welsh rarebit. Hearty speeches were rattled off by Christopher Martin-Jenkins and the former cabinet minister Peter Brooke. And the top table was crowded with venerable guests, including Clive Lloyd, Graham Thorpe, WF Deedes and Bob Woolmer. Plus women were served at the bar, though in the best traditions of having your cake and eating it I couldn't tell you if drinks were expensive because I had all mine bought for me.

To make matters worse, Wasim Akram had pulled a groin muscle after delivering just 13 balls in Sri Lanka's first innings and would not bowl again in the match. Pakistan then lost eight wickets while establishing a lead of just 65. Then things changed. Debutant Younis Khan, a 22-year-old right-handed batsman from Habib Bank, paired up with the wounded Wasim, batting with a runner, to add 145 for the ninth wicket (a record for Pakistan v Sri Lanka). Khan became only the fourth batsman to make a Test century on <a href=\"http://www.cricketunlimited.co.uk/Articles/0,5217,141768,00.html\"> Leap Year's Day</a>. Sri Lanka were set 220 to win in just over a day, but from 144 for 4, lost four for 33 as Pakistan sensed a remarkable comeback. Arjuna Ranatunga, however, who had earlier retired hurt with a broken finger, summoned up almost two decades of Test experience and kept wicketkeeper Romesh Kaluwitharana company to ensure Saeed Anwar got off to a losing start as Pakistan captain. <br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> Sri Lanka continue their almost unnoticed rise up the world hierarchy. </p> <p><strong>Second Test, Peshawar, Mar 5-9, </strong> <br> <strong>Sri Lanka won by 57 runs</strong> <br> <strong>Sri Lanka</strong> 268 (Atapattu 75, Shoaib Akhtar 5-75) and 224 (Arnold 99) <br> <strong>Pakistan</strong> 199 (Saeed Anwar 74, Inzamam-ul-Haq 58*, Muralitharan 4-77) and 236 (Yousuf Youhana 88, Muralitharan 6-71) <br> <strong>Toss</strong> Pakistan <strong>Debuts</strong> Atiq-uz-Zaman (Pakistan) </p> <p>Sri Lanka moved third in the Wisden World Championship with another Murali-inspired win. On a wicket that increasingly suited his wristy wiles, Muttiah Muralitharan took 10-148 - his third ten-wicket bag in Tests - as Pakistan slumped to their fifth successive Test defeat and fifth place in the table. After rain had delayed the start, Sri Lanka made wary progress against a Pakistan attack lacking the injured Wasim Akram but boosted by the fire of Shoaib Akhtar, who picked up a highly legal five-for. Pakistan were going well in reply, and reached 137 for 2 before calamity struck: while Inzamam-ul-Haq watched from one end, his colleagues committed suicide at the other, and the last eight wickets fell for just 61. With a lead of 69 on a pitch beginning to take spin, Sri Lanka were in the box seat. They remained there thanks to Russel Arnold who held things together with 99. Set 294, Pakistan were given a solid 59-run platform by their openers, but when Shahid Afridi was stumped for 31, three more wickets followed quickly to leave them 103 for 4. Yousuf Youhana stroked them back into the game, and at 208 for 5, it was back in the balance. But Chaminda Vaas and Murali combined to snaffle the last five for 28 and Sri Lanka had reached their highest world ranking yet. <br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> For the first time ever, neither Pakistan nor India is the best Test team in Asia. And while Murali's still around, Sri Lanka can get better. </p> <p><strong>Third Test, Karachi, Mar 12-15</strong> <br> <strong>Pakistan won by 222 runs</strong> <br> <strong>Pakistan</strong> 256 (Shahid Afridi 74, Inzamam-ul-Haq 86, Muralitharan 4-89) and 421 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 138, Younis Khan 61, Moin Khan 70, Pushpakumara 4-66, Muralitharan 4-107) <br> <strong>Sri Lanka</strong> 227 and 228 <br> <strong>Toss</strong> Sri Lanka <strong>Debuts</strong> Irfan Fazil (Pakistan) </p> <p>Inzamam-ul-Haq ensured that Pakistan, captained by Moin Khan in the absence of the injured Saeed Anwar, avoided not only a sixth successive Test defeat, but their first at the National Stadium for 34 matches, and their first whitewash in a home series. And in the process of hitting his ninth Test century, Inzy became only the fifth Pakistani to reach 4000 Test runs - after Javed Miandad (8832), Salim Malik (5768), Zaheer Abbas (5062) and Mudassar Nazar (4114). It was even stevens after the first innings, and even more when Pakistan stumbled to 159 for 5 second time round. But Inzy, who had already shepherded nightwatchman Shoaib Akhtar to a 42-ball duck, and the Khans helped add 262 for the last five wickets. Sri Lanka, set 451 to win, batted with the indulgence of a side that had already won the series, and went down in a blaze of strokes, eating up just 46 overs (a session and a half) while whacking 228. <br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> Consolation victories are rarely this crucial. Pakistan must build on it for their tour of the Caribbean. </p> <p> <strong>India v South Africa</strong></p> <p><strong>First Test, Mumbai, Feb 24-26</strong><br> <strong>South Africa won by four wickets</strong><br> <strong>India</strong> 225 (Tendulkar 97) and 113 (Pollock 4-24) <br> <strong>South Africa</strong> 176 (Kirsten 50) and 164 for 6 (Kumble 4-56) <br> <strong>Toss</strong> India <strong>Debuts</strong> Jaffer, Kartik (India), Boje (South Africa) </p> <p>A thriller on a turner. Set 163 to inflict a rare home defeat on the Indians (Cronje said 200 would have been the cut-off point), South Africa cruised to 107 for 2. But they then lost four for 21 as Anil Kumble, who moved joint-second with Bishan Bedi in India's all-time wicket-taking list on 266, exploited familiar insecurities against top-class spin. Mark Boucher, though, has nothing insecure about him, and proceeded to thump six fearless fours to steer the Proteas home as Jacques Kallis held firm at the other end. It was an unlikely victory after India had begun with the highest total of the match and Sachin Tendulkar in regal form, hitting 97 before Kallis had him caught behind down the legside. Ajit Agarkar even broke a run of five ducks with an aggressive unbeaten 41 from 42 balls. Gary Kirsten and Herschelle Gibbs then put on 90, but when all ten fell for just 86, India's thoughts turned batting South Africa out of the game But the Little Master went early, and from 73 for 3, the rest followed subserviently, Shaun Pollock picking up four cheap wickets. It was just the boost South Africa needed; India meanwhile slumped to their fourth Test defeat in a row.<br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> Is India's invincibility at home becoming a thing of the past? </p> <p><strong>Second Test, Bangalore, Mar 2-6</strong> <br> <strong>South Africa won by an innings and 71 runs</strong><br> <strong>India </strong> 158 and 250 (Azharuddin 102, Boje 5-83)<br> <strong>South Africa </strong> 479 (Kirsten 79, Boje 85, Kallis 95, Cullinan 53, Klusener 97, Kumble 6-143)<br> <strong>Toss</strong> India <strong>Debuts</strong> Chopra, Kaif (both India) </p> <p>It was Nicky Boje's match. And South Africa's series. Not since 1986-87, when Imran Khan led Pakistan to a 1-0 win, had India lost a Test series at home. Now they were outspun in their own backyard as slow left-armer Boje, playing in his second Test, returned match figures of 53-20-93-7, including 5-83 on a turning wicket in the second innings. Boje had already outstayed his welcome as nightwatchman, scoring 85 in almost four hours and adding 161 for the second wicket with Gary Kirsten to take South Africa past India's limp first-innings showing. Five of South Africa's top six passed fifty so it didn't matter that their last six wickets fell for just 44: with a lead of 321 and the pitch starting to break up, victory was a matter of time. Mohammad Azharuddin, back after more than a year on the sidelines, held South Africa up with a glorious century (his 22nd in Tests, and his first since Boxing Day, 1998), but Boje winkled out the others - and history was made. It was a dismal end to Sachin Tendulkar's reign as captain. India dropped to seventh in the Wisden World Championship, below New Zealand, while South Africa closed the gap on Australia at the top.<br><strong>Wisden verdict</strong> Indian cricket may be in disarray, but South Africa still did what no-one has managed for 13 years and beat them at their own game. </p> <p> <strong>New Zealand v West Indies</strong></p> <p><strong>First Test, Hamilton, Dec 16-20</strong><br> <strong>New Zealand won by nine wickets</strong><br> <strong>West Indies</strong> 365 (Griffith 114, Campbell 170, Vettori 4-83) and 97 (Cairns 7-27)<br> <strong>New Zealand</strong> 393 (Fleming 66, McMillan 51, Cairns 72, King 4-81) and 70 for 1<br> <strong>Toss</strong> West Indies <strong>Debuts</strong> Powell (West Indies)</p> <p>Comebacks should retire gracefully after this. Coached for the first time by Viv Richards, West Indies coasted to 276 for 0 and thoughts turned to an inngs victory. But they contrived to lose by nine wickets in one of the most sensational Tests of recent times. The unthinkable began late on the first evening when Sherwin Campbell departed for a blistering 170 to trigger an alarming collapse: all ten wickets, including Adrian Griffith for a maiden Test hundred, fell for 89. New Zealand replied with gutsy and - thanks to Chris Cairns - explosive batting to sneak a lead of 28. Cairns now exploded again, this time with the ball. He took wickets in each of his first two overs to help reduce West Indies, in a winter of disastrous starts, to 1 for 3. But that was just for starters: against batting that had ground to a halt, he added five more to humble West Indies for 93 and return Test-best figures of 7-27 from 22.5 overs. He was aided by left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori, who tightened the noose with 22-12-20-1. Chasing 70 to win, the Black Caps were never threatened, although Matt Horhe had to retire hurt after having his right index finger broken by a ball from Franklyn Rose.<br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> Will anyone dare call New Zealand uncharismatic again?</p> <p><strong>Second Test, Wellington, Dec 26-29</strong><br> <strong>New Zealand won by an innings and 105 runs</strong><br> <strong>New Zealand</strong> 518 for 9 declared (Sinclair 214, Fleming 67, Astle 93, King 4-96)<br> <strong>West Indies</strong> 179 (Griffith 67, Lara 67, Cairns 5-44) and 234 (Chanderpaul 70, Lara 75, Nash 4-38)<br><strong>Toss</strong> West Indies <strong>Debuts</strong> Sinclair (New Zealand)</p> <p>Mathew Sinclair became the fourth man in Test history to make a double-hundred on debut; only England's Reg Foster, who hit 287 at Sydney in 1903-04, has done better. On a placid Basin Reserve wicket, Sinclair put New Zealand on course for their highest total in home Tests against West Indies (beating 460 at Christchurch in 1979-80) - this despite a decline from 429 for 3. West Indies, a man short after Daren Ganga injured himself in the field, then collapsed to the rejuvenated Chris Cairns, losing their last four wickets in just 19 balls. Following on, they fared little better, and were skewered by Dion Nash as their final seven wickets fell for 86. Brian Lara hit two half-centuries, but the West Indian batting line-up is weaker now than it has been for years. It was the first time New Zealand had won two in a series against West Indies, and their first win over them since the controversial series in 1979-80, when Michael Holding kicked down the stumps and Colin Croft charged into the umpire in response to several unfavourable decisions. The 2-0 result overturns West Indies's 1-0 win here five years ago, and, although the Black Caps are still seventh in the Wisden World Championship, they extend their lead over eighth-placed England to 0.24. West Indies remain third, but are now just 0.01 in front of Pakistan. <br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> A result that would have been inconceivable in the 1980s. New Zealand and the Windies have traded places in the new world order.</p> <p> <strong>Australia v India</strong></p> <p><strong>First Test, Adelaide, Dec 10-14</strong><br> <strong>Australia won by 285 runs</strong><br> <strong>Australia</strong> 441 (Steve Waugh 150, Ponting 125, Warne 86) and 239 for 8 decl. (Blewett 88)<br> <strong>India</strong> 285 (Tendulkar 61, Ganguly 60, Warne 4-92) and 110 (Fleming 5-30)<br> <strong>Toss</strong> Australia <strong>Debuts</strong> None</p> <p>After deciding to bat on a typical Adelaide belter, Australia were almost caught with their trousers down, and faltered to 52 for 4. It was the sort of crisis made for Steve Waugh, who inscrutably added 239 for the fifth wicket with Ricky Ponting, an Aussie all-wicket record against India. Waugh hit his 21st Test century to join Sachin Tendulkar at the top of the list of contemporary players, and passed 8,000 runs in the process. He also completed a full hand of hundreds against the other eight Test nations - the first man to do so. Ponting uniquely hit back-to-back Test hundreds after registering a pair (he made 197 in the third Test against Pakistan at Perth, after two ducks at Hobart). And Shane Warne equalled the career-best he had established a few weeks earlier in Brisbane. Anil Kumble took his 260th Test wicket (Michael Kasprowicz) - but his first in Australia. India began badly, recovered to 215 for 4, but then lost their last six wickets for 70. Australia had all the time in the world to ensure against defeat, and promptly used it, batting almost 90 overs to reach 239 for 8 and leave India 396 to win. It turned out to be more than enough, as India stumbled to 76 for 5 on the fourth evening. The casualties included Tendulkar, controversially given out lbw to Glenn McGrath as he ducked into a short-pitched delivery that kept low, and was hit on the shoulder. India were outraged - but the ball would probably have clipped the bails. Next day, Fleming claimed career-best figures and was a dropped catch away from becoming the fourth man to take two Test hat-tricks: Warne spilt a catch at slip off Javagal Srinath. It was the most minor of blemishes as the Aussies notched up a fifth successive win - their best sequence since winning four on the trot against West Indies in 1975-76.<br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> India are flat-track bullies who get scared when they leave their own patch - particularly when they go Down Under. Australia sorted them out again, and haven't lost a home Test against them for 19 years. </p> <p><strong>Second Test, Melbourne, Dec 26-30</strong><br> <strong>Australia won by 180 runs</strong><br> <strong>Australia</strong> 405 (Slater 91, Ponting 67, Gilchrist 78, Srinath 4-130) and 208 for 5 declared (Gilchrist 55, Mark Waugh 51*)<br> <strong>India</strong> 238 (Tendulkar 116, Lee 5-47) and 195 (Tendulkar 52)<br> <strong>Toss</strong> India <strong>Debuts</strong> Lee (Australia), Kanitkar (India)</p> <p>India put Australia in on an untypically hard and bouncy MCG wicket, took two early wickets, but were then batted out of the game by Michael Slater's eighth Test score in the nineties (only Steve Waugh, with nine near-misses, has shown more nerves), and a rasping stand of 144 for the sixth wicket in 32 overs between Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist. Venkatesh Prasad was fined 35% of his match fee for getting carried away when he dismissed Slater. Rain had shortened the first two days, but Australia made up for lost time, as debutant Brett Lee took a wicket with his fourth ball, and later added three in six. He looked seriously quick and finished with 5-44. Only Sachin Tendulkar, egged on by a noisy Indian contingent, could find an answer. He made his 22nd Test hundred, his fifth against Australia and his first at the MCG. Australia then left India needing 376 to win. It was never a contest, especially after Shane Warne, to his obvious delight, had trapped Tendulkar leg before playing no stroke for 52. <br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> Aussies make it six Test wins in a row and unearth a ferocious new fast bowler just for good measure. Can anyone stop them?</p> <p><strong>Third Test, Sydney, Jan 2-4 </strong><br> <strong>Australia won by an innings and 141 runs</strong><br> <strong>India</strong>150 (McGrath 5-48, Lee 4-39) and 261 (Laxman 167, McGrath 5-55)<br> <strong>Australia</strong>552 for 5 declared (Langer 223, Steve Waugh 57, Ponting 141*)<br> <strong>Toss</strong> India <strong>Debuts</strong> None</p> <p>Australia made it a summer to remember with their second consecutive 3-0 series win, and their seventh Test victory in a row. After Glenn McGrath and the Brett Lee had blasted India out for next to nothing, Australia shrugged off the early loss of their openers to fly to 552 at almost a run a minute. Justin Langer, bowled by a Javagal Srinath no-ball on 46, moved to his highest score in Tests and the highest for Australia against India. Ricky Ponting's 141 took just 183 balls, and lifted his sequence to 572 runs in his last six Test innings at 143.00 after registering three consecutive ducks against Pakistan. Adam Gilchrist's 45* raised his Test average to 69.29 (485 runs). Only Vangipurappu Laxman, with 63.98% of the total, passed 25 second time round, as McGrath completed match figures of 10-103. Laxman added 121 between tea and the close on the final day: only Victor Trumper (133 for Australia v South Africa at Melbourne in 1910-11) has scored more in a Test-match session. Ajit Agarkar fell first ball in the first innings, and second in the second. It was his second pair in a row, and meant he had now been dismissed five times in six balls - an unprecedented catalogue of disaster in Tests. <br> <strong>Wisden Verdict</strong> Steve Waugh said after the game that he'd back his side against any team in any era. It's hard to disagree. </p> <p> <strong>South Africa v England</strong></p> <p><strong>First Test, Johannesburg, Nov 25-28</strong><br> <strong>South Africa won by an innings and 21 runs</strong><br> <strong>England</strong> 122 (Donald 6-53, Pollock 4-16) and 260 (Stewart 86, Donald 5-74, Pollock 4-64)<br> <strong>South Africa</strong> 403-9 declared (Gibbs 85, Cullinan 108, Klusener 72, Gough 5-70)<br> <strong>Toss</strong> South Africa <strong>Debuts</strong> Adams, Hamilton, Vaughan (all England)</p> <p>On a wet pitch and in gloomy conditions, England slumped to a sensational 2-4 against Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock - and never recovered. It was the second-worst start in Test history (Fred Trueman reduced India to 0-4 at Headingley in 1952), and the most unreal beginning to a Test series ever. Michael Vaughan (33) showed composure and Andy Flintoff (38) genuine moments of class as England clawed their way back to 90-5, but another collapse soon followed, and England were in the field shortly before tea on the first day. South Africa gathered runs slowly to begin with, but Daryll Cullinan lifted the tempo with the classiest innings of the match, and Lance Klusener flogged the tiring bowlers as only he can. Hansie Cronje's declaration deprived Darren Gough the chance of a hat-trick - he will have to wait for his first ball of the second Test after dismissing Pollock and Donald with successive deliveries. Batting again, England lost Mike Atherton for his second duck of the game: it was his second pair in consecutive overseas Tests, following Melbourne last winter, and he now has 19 Test ducks, equalling Derek Underwood's England record. No other specialist batsman in history has as many. Alec Stewart mixed fortune with blazing cuts and drives, and Flintoff (36) again played attractively, before Andy Caddick (48) biffed his way to a Test-best. Gavin Hamilton became the first Englishman since Graham Gooch (against Australia at Edgbaston in 1975) to make a pair on debut. It was South Africa's biggest win against England and their 10th win on the trot at home. <br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> England undone by the pitch and the best new-ball attack of the last decade. Winning the toss would only have lessened the margin of defeat.</p> <p><strong>Second Test, Port Elizabeth, Dec 9-13</strong><br> <strong>Drawn</strong><br> <strong>South Africa</strong> 450 (Cullinan 58, Rhodes 50, Klusener 174, Tufnell 4-124) and 224 for 4 decl. (Kallis 85*, Rhodes 57*)<br> <strong>England</strong> 373 (Atherton 108, Hussain 82, Hayward 4-75) and 153 for 6 (Hussain 70*)<br> <strong>Toss</strong> England <strong>Debuts</strong> Hayward (South Africa)</p> <p>England were left clinging on to a draw on a slow wicket that became more uneven as the game developed. It was the first time in ten home Tests that South Africa had failed to win - although home umpire Rudi Koertzen at times appeared to be doing his best to make it 11 victories in a row. Six disputed decisions - all to the detriment of England - almost brought South Africa a victory which the ultra-defensive captaincy of Hansie Cronje scarcely deserved. On the first day, South Africa were helped out of a hole (146 for 5) by an innings of unconfined violence from Lance Klusener, who once and for all made the transition from one-day biffer to Test-match destroyer. England replied with their best first-innings total since Brisbane, over a year ago, and Mike Atherton, on the back of four consecutive overseas ducks, hit their first Test hundred since Alec Stewart at Melbourne last Christmas. He added 155 for the second wicket with the vibrant Nasser Hussain, and took on the frightening pace of debutant Nantie Hayward with the gusto of old. South Africa were soon in trouble at 50 for 3 (it could have been 4 if the cameras had picked up Chris Adams's excellent reflex catch to dismiss Jacques Kallis), and opted for safety, dawdling 92.5 overs for 224 runs. Eventually, England were left 79 overs to survive (Cronje thus bizarrely denying himself the use of a second new ball), and got off to a poor start. But from 5 for 2, Hussain and Vaughan dug in. And by the time wickets started to fall near the close, it was too late for South Africa. <br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> South Africa paid the price for going on the defensive too soon. England are beginning to make a habit of irritating them with rearguards - when will Cronje learn?</p> <p> <strong>Third Test, Durban, Dec 26-30</strong> <br> <strong>Drawn </strong><br> <strong>England</strong> 366 for 9 decl. (Hussain 146*, Stewart 95) <br> <strong>South Africa</strong> 156 (Pollock 64, Caddick 7-46) and 572 for 7 (Kirsten 275, Kallis 69, Boucher 108) <br> <strong>Toss</strong> England <strong>Debuts</strong> None </p> <p>A game that entered the final day with the possibility of an England win ended in a bore draw as Gary Kirsten equalled the South African individual Test record with an innings that lasted 22 minutes shy of 15 hours. It was the second-longest in Tests, after Hanif Mohammad's 970-minute epic for Pakistan v West Indies at Bridgetown in 1957-58 (Hanif himself claims it was 999). Kirsten added 192 for the fifth wicket with nightwatchman Mark Boucher to snuff out England's hopes of levelling the series. Nasser Hussain and Alec Stewart had earlier put on 158 for the fourth wicket - more than any England pair had added all year - before Andy Caddick, extracting bounce and movement where the South Africans had found none, recorded Test-best figures of 7-46, passing 100 wickets in the process. It gave England their first first-innings lead for 17 Tests, and allowed them to enforce their first follow-on since New Zealand at Old Trafford in 1994. But they got little change from a bone-dry pitch second time round, and were left to regret a Phil Tufnell no-ball, which would have trapped Kirsten plumb in front when he had 40. <br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> England still unable to dominate for an entire Test. </p> <p> <strong>Fourth Test, Cape Town, Jan 2-5</strong> <br> <strong>South Africa won by an innings and 37 runs</strong> <br> <strong>England</strong> 258 (Atherton 71, Donald 5-47) and 126 <br> <strong>South Africa</strong> 421 (Kirsten 80, Kallis 105, Cullinan 120, Silverwood 5-91) <br> <strong>Toss</strong> England <strong>Debuts</strong> None </p> <p>At 213 for 3 with half an hour to go on the first day, England were on top of the world. But things quickly went downhill. Allan Donald won a battle of wits with Alec Stewart, the rest followed meekly - even Lance Klusener got a wicket, his first of the series - and South Africa reached 200 for 1 by the second-day close. A mini fightback next day, led by the persevering Chris Silverwood, limited the deficit to 163 (as Cullinan reached his third century in consecutive Tests at Newlands), but England, batting a man short after Andy Flintoff broke his foot while bowling, performed like a team that believed they had already lost. All out for 126 - and another overseas series had gone begging. South Africa, led for the 50th time by Hansie Cronje, had never beaten England by so much. Donald's six wickets in the match took him to 86 in Tests - three more than SF Barnes's previous record for South Africa-England Tests. Mark Boucher simultaneously held his 100th Test catch and 200th first-class dismissal when he caught Nasser Hussain in the first innings, while Hussain became the first man to bat for more than 1000 minutes in Tests between dismissals. <br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> England regress to dark old days.</p> <p><strong>Fifth Test, Centurion, Jan 14-18</strong> <br> <strong>England won by 2 wickets</strong> <br> <strong>South Africa</strong> 248 for 8 decl.

But England weren't complaining and duly scraped home with five balls and two wickets to spare after heavy rain had washed out the second, third and fourth days. They were grateful to two factors: the generosity of Hansie Cronje, whose target of 249 in 76 overs on a pitch that was flattening out was about as generous as he can ever have been; and a fifth-wicket stand of 126 between Alec Stewart and Michael Vaughan, who became the first man outside the big three of Stewart, Mike Atherton and Nasser Hussain to pass 50 in this series for England. At 228 for 4, England were walking it. But, true to form, they stumbled, losing four wickets for 12 as the pendulum swung South Africa's way. Then Chris Silverwood and Darren Gough hit a boundary each and England had limited the series damage to a slightly flattering 2-1. <br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> Ignore the purists: this was a victory for commonsense in a game that could do with more of it. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Pakistan v Sri Lanka First Test, Rawalpindi, Feb 26-Mar 1 Sri Lanka won by two wickets Pakistan 182 (Wickremasinghe 4-37, Muralitharan 4-45) and 390 (Saeed Anwar 84, Younis Khan 107, Wasim Akram 79, Muralitharan 4-127) Sri Lanka 353 (de Silva 112, Vaas 53*, Waqar Younis 4-103) and 220 for 8 (Jayasuriya 56, Abdur Razzaq 4-56) Toss Sri Lanka Debuts Younis Khan (Pakistan) The match seemed over when Pakistan were demolished on the opening day and Aravinda de Silva, returning to the Test side after missing the home series against Australia and Zimbabwe, hit his eighth Test century against this opposition, and his 18th in all, to give Sri Lanka a first-innings lead of 171. To make matters worse, Wasim Akram had pulled a groin muscle after delivering just 13 balls in Sri Lanka's first innings and would not bowl again in the match. Pakistan then lost eight wickets while establishing a lead of just 65. Then things changed. Debutant Younis Khan, a 22-year-old right-handed batsman from Habib Bank, paired up with the wounded Wasim, batting with a runner, to add 145 for the ninth wicket (a record for Pakistan v Sri Lanka). Khan became only the fourth batsman to make a Test century on Leap Year's Day. Sri Lanka were set 220 to win in just over a day, but from 144 for 4, lost four for 33 as Pakistan sensed a remarkable comeback. Arjuna Ranatunga, however, who had earlier retired hurt with a broken finger, summoned up almost two decades of Test experience and kept wicketkeeper Romesh Kaluwitharana company to ensure Saeed Anwar got off to a losing start as Pakistan captain. Wisden verdict Sri Lanka continue their almost unnoticed rise up the world hierarchy. Second Test, Peshawar, Mar 5-9, Sri Lanka won by 57 runs Sri Lanka 268 (Atapattu 75, Shoaib Akhtar 5-75) and 224 (Arnold 99) Pakistan 199 (Saeed Anwar 74, Inzamam-ul-Haq 58*, Muralitharan 4-77) and 236 (Yousuf Youhana 88, Muralitharan 6-71) Toss Pakistan Debuts Atiq-uz-Zaman (Pakistan) Sri Lanka moved third in the Wisden World Championship with another Murali-inspired win. On a wicket that increasingly suited his wristy wiles, Muttiah Muralitharan took 10-148 - his third ten-wicket bag in Tests - as Pakistan slumped to their fifth successive Test defeat and fifth place in the table. After rain had delayed the start, Sri Lanka made wary progress against a Pakistan attack lacking the injured Wasim Akram but boosted by the fire of Shoaib Akhtar, who picked up a highly legal five-for. Pakistan were going well in reply, and reached 137 for 2 before calamity struck: while Inzamam-ul-Haq watched from one end, his colleagues committed suicide at the other, and the last eight wickets fell for just 61. With a lead of 69 on a pitch beginning to take spin, Sri Lanka were in the box seat. They remained there thanks to Russel Arnold who held things together with 99. Set 294, Pakistan were given a solid 59-run platform by their openers, but when Shahid Afridi was stumped for 31, three more wickets followed quickly to leave them 103 for 4. Yousuf Youhana stroked them back into the game, and at 208 for 5, it was back in the balance. But Chaminda Vaas and Murali combined to snaffle the last five for 28 and Sri Lanka had reached their highest world ranking yet. Wisden verdict For the first time ever, neither Pakistan nor India is the best Test team in Asia. And while Murali's still around, Sri Lanka can get better. Third Test, Karachi, Mar 12-15 Pakistan won by 222 runs Pakistan 256 (Shahid Afridi 74, Inzamam-ul-Haq 86, Muralitharan 4-89) and 421 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 138, Younis Khan 61, Moin Khan 70, Pushpakumara 4-66, Muralitharan 4-107) Sri Lanka 227 and 228 Toss Sri Lanka Debuts Irfan Fazil (Pakistan) Inzamam-ul-Haq ensured that Pakistan, captained by Moin Khan in the absence of the injured Saeed Anwar, avoided not only a sixth successive Test defeat, but their first at the National Stadium for 34 matches, and their first whitewash in a home series. And in the process of hitting his ninth Test century, Inzy became only the fifth Pakistani to reach 4000 Test runs - after Javed Miandad (8832), Salim Malik (5768), Zaheer Abbas (5062) and Mudassar Nazar (4114). It was even stevens after the first innings, and even more when Pakistan stumbled to 159 for 5 second time round. But Inzy, who had already shepherded nightwatchman Shoaib Akhtar to a 42-ball duck, and the Khans helped add 262 for the last five wickets. Sri Lanka, set 451 to win, batted with the indulgence of a side that had already won the series, and went down in a blaze of strokes, eating up just 46 overs (a session and a half) while whacking 228. Wisden verdict Consolation victories are rarely this crucial. Pakistan must build on it for their tour of the Caribbean. India v South Africa First Test, Mumbai, Feb 24-26 South Africa won by four wickets India 225 (Tendulkar 97) and 113 (Pollock 4-24) South Africa 176 (Kirsten 50) and 164 for 6 (Kumble 4-56) Toss India Debuts Jaffer, Kartik (India), Boje (South Africa) A thriller on a turner. Set 163 to inflict a rare home defeat on the Indians (Cronje said 200 would have been the cut-off point), South Africa cruised to 107 for 2. But they then lost four for 21 as Anil Kumble, who moved joint-second with Bishan Bedi in India's all-time wicket-taking list on 266, exploited familiar insecurities against top-class spin. Mark Boucher, though, has nothing insecure about him, and proceeded to thump six fearless fours to steer the Proteas home as Jacques Kallis held firm at the other end. It was an unlikely victory after India had begun with the highest total of the match and Sachin Tendulkar in regal form, hitting 97 before Kallis had him caught behind down the legside. Ajit Agarkar even broke a run of five ducks with an aggressive unbeaten 41 from 42 balls. Gary Kirsten and Herschelle Gibbs then put on 90, but when all ten fell for just 86, India's thoughts turned batting South Africa out of the game But the Little Master went early, and from 73 for 3, the rest followed subserviently, Shaun Pollock picking up four cheap wickets. It was just the boost South Africa needed; India meanwhile slumped to their fourth Test defeat in a row. Wisden verdict Is India's invincibility at home becoming a thing of the past? Second Test, Bangalore, Mar 2-6 South Africa won by an innings and 71 runs India 158 and 250 (Azharuddin 102, Boje 5-83) South Africa 479 (Kirsten 79, Boje 85, Kallis 95, Cullinan 53, Klusener 97, Kumble 6-143) Toss India Debuts Chopra, Kaif (both India) It was Nicky Boje's match. And South Africa's series. Not since 1986-87, when Imran Khan led Pakistan to a 1-0 win, had India lost a Test series at home. Now they were outspun in their own backyard as slow left-armer Boje, playing in his second Test, returned match figures of 53-20-93-7, including 5-83 on a turning wicket in the second innings. Boje had already outstayed his welcome as nightwatchman, scoring 85 in almost four hours and adding 161 for the second wicket with Gary Kirsten to take South Africa past India's limp first-innings showing. Five of South Africa's top six passed fifty so it didn't matter that their last six wickets fell for just 44: with a lead of 321 and the pitch starting to break up, victory was a matter of time. Mohammad Azharuddin, back after more than a year on the sidelines, held South Africa up with a glorious century (his 22nd in Tests, and his first since Boxing Day, 1998), but Boje winkled out the others - and history was made. It was a dismal end to Sachin Tendulkar's reign as captain. India dropped to seventh in the Wisden World Championship, below New Zealand, while South Africa closed the gap on Australia at the top. Wisden verdict Indian cricket may be in disarray, but South Africa still did what no-one has managed for 13 years and beat them at their own game. New Zealand v West Indies First Test, Hamilton, Dec 16-20 New Zealand won by nine wickets West Indies 365 (Griffith 114, Campbell 170, Vettori 4-83) and 97 (Cairns 7-27) New Zealand 393 (Fleming 66, McMillan 51, Cairns 72, King 4-81) and 70 for 1 Toss West Indies Debuts Powell (West Indies) Comebacks should retire gracefully after this. Coached for the first time by Viv Richards, West Indies coasted to 276 for 0 and thoughts turned to an inngs victory. But they contrived to lose by nine wickets in one of the most sensational Tests of recent times. The unthinkable began late on the first evening when Sherwin Campbell departed for a blistering 170 to trigger an alarming collapse: all ten wickets, including Adrian Griffith for a maiden Test hundred, fell for 89. New Zealand replied with gutsy and - thanks to Chris Cairns - explosive batting to sneak a lead of 28. Cairns now exploded again, this time with the ball. He took wickets in each of his first two overs to help reduce West Indies, in a winter of disastrous starts, to 1 for 3. But that was just for starters: against batting that had ground to a halt, he added five more to humble West Indies for 93 and return Test-best figures of 7-27 from 22.5 overs. He was aided by left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori, who tightened the noose with 22-12-20-1. Chasing 70 to win, the Black Caps were never threatened, although Matt Horhe had to retire hurt after having his right index finger broken by a ball from Franklyn Rose. Wisden verdict Will anyone dare call New Zealand uncharismatic again? Second Test, Wellington, Dec 26-29 New Zealand won by an innings and 105 runs New Zealand 518 for 9 declared (Sinclair 214, Fleming 67, Astle 93, King 4-96) West Indies 179 (Griffith 67, Lara 67, Cairns 5-44) and 234 (Chanderpaul 70, Lara 75, Nash 4-38) Toss West Indies Debuts Sinclair (New Zealand) Mathew Sinclair became the fourth man in Test history to make a double-hundred on debut; only England's Reg Foster, who hit 287 at Sydney in 1903-04, has done better. On a placid Basin Reserve wicket, Sinclair put New Zealand on course for their highest total in home Tests against West Indies (beating 460 at Christchurch in 1979-80) - this despite a decline from 429 for 3. West Indies, a man short after Daren Ganga injured himself in the field, then collapsed to the rejuvenated Chris Cairns, losing their last four wickets in just 19 balls. Following on, they fared little better, and were skewered by Dion Nash as their final seven wickets fell for 86. Brian Lara hit two half-centuries, but the West Indian batting line-up is weaker now than it has been for years. It was the first time New Zealand had won two in a series against West Indies, and their first win over them since the controversial series in 1979-80, when Michael Holding kicked down the stumps and Colin Croft charged into the umpire in response to several unfavourable decisions. The 2-0 result overturns West Indies's 1-0 win here five years ago, and, although the Black Caps are still seventh in the Wisden World Championship, they extend their lead over eighth-placed England to 0.24. West Indies remain third, but are now just 0.01 in front of Pakistan. Wisden verdict A result that would have been inconceivable in the 1980s. New Zealand and the Windies have traded places in the new world order. Australia v India First Test, Adelaide, Dec 10-14 Australia won by 285 runs Australia 441 (Steve Waugh 150, Ponting 125, Warne 86) and 239 for 8 decl. (Blewett 88) India 285 (Tendulkar 61, Ganguly 60, Warne 4-92) and 110 (Fleming 5-30) Toss Australia Debuts None After deciding to bat on a typical Adelaide belter, Australia were almost caught with their trousers down, and faltered to 52 for 4. It was the sort of crisis made for Steve Waugh, who inscrutably added 239 for the fifth wicket with Ricky Ponting, an Aussie all-wicket record against India. Waugh hit his 21st Test century to join Sachin Tendulkar at the top of the list of contemporary players, and passed 8,000 runs in the process. He also completed a full hand of hundreds against the other eight Test nations - the first man to do so. Ponting uniquely hit back-to-back Test hundreds after registering a pair (he made 197 in the third Test against Pakistan at Perth, after two ducks at Hobart). And Shane Warne equalled the career-best he had established a few weeks earlier in Brisbane. Anil Kumble took his 260th Test wicket (Michael Kasprowicz) - but his first in Australia. India began badly, recovered to 215 for 4, but then lost their last six wickets for 70. Australia had all the time in the world to ensure against defeat, and promptly used it, batting almost 90 overs to reach 239 for 8 and leave India 396 to win. It turned out to be more than enough, as India stumbled to 76 for 5 on the fourth evening. The casualties included Tendulkar, controversially given out lbw to Glenn McGrath as he ducked into a short-pitched delivery that kept low, and was hit on the shoulder. India were outraged - but the ball would probably have clipped the bails. Next day, Fleming claimed career-best figures and was a dropped catch away from becoming the fourth man to take two Test hat-tricks: Warne spilt a catch at slip off Javagal Srinath. It was the most minor of blemishes as the Aussies notched up a fifth successive win - their best sequence since winning four on the trot against West Indies in 1975-76. Wisden verdict India are flat-track bullies who get scared when they leave their own patch - particularly when they go Down Under. Australia sorted them out again, and haven't lost a home Test against them for 19 years. Second Test, Melbourne, Dec 26-30 Australia won by 180 runs Australia 405 (Slater 91, Ponting 67, Gilchrist 78, Srinath 4-130) and 208 for 5 declared (Gilchrist 55, Mark Waugh 51*) India 238 (Tendulkar 116, Lee 5-47) and 195 (Tendulkar 52) Toss India Debuts Lee (Australia), Kanitkar (India) India put Australia in on an untypically hard and bouncy MCG wicket, took two early wickets, but were then batted out of the game by Michael Slater's eighth Test score in the nineties (only Steve Waugh, with nine near-misses, has shown more nerves), and a rasping stand of 144 for the sixth wicket in 32 overs between Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist. Venkatesh Prasad was fined 35% of his match fee for getting carried away when he dismissed Slater. Rain had shortened the first two days, but Australia made up for lost time, as debutant Brett Lee took a wicket with his fourth ball, and later added three in six. He looked seriously quick and finished with 5-44. Only Sachin Tendulkar, egged on by a noisy Indian contingent, could find an answer. He made his 22nd Test hundred, his fifth against Australia and his first at the MCG. Australia then left India needing 376 to win. It was never a contest, especially after Shane Warne, to his obvious delight, had trapped Tendulkar leg before playing no stroke for 52. Wisden verdict Aussies make it six Test wins in a row and unearth a ferocious new fast bowler just for good measure. Can anyone stop them? Third Test, Sydney, Jan 2-4 Australia won by an innings and 141 runs India150 (McGrath 5-48, Lee 4-39) and 261 (Laxman 167, McGrath 5-55) Australia552 for 5 declared (Langer 223, Steve Waugh 57, Ponting 141*) Toss India Debuts None Australia made it a summer to remember with their second consecutive 3-0 series win, and their seventh Test victory in a row. After Glenn McGrath and the Brett Lee had blasted India out for next to nothing, Australia shrugged off the early loss of their openers to fly to 552 at almost a run a minute. Justin Langer, bowled by a Javagal Srinath no-ball on 46, moved to his highest score in Tests and the highest for Australia against India. Ricky Ponting's 141 took just 183 balls, and lifted his sequence to 572 runs in his last six Test innings at 143.00 after registering three consecutive ducks against Pakistan. Adam Gilchrist's 45* raised his Test average to 69.29 (485 runs). Only Vangipurappu Laxman, with 63.98% of the total, passed 25 second time round, as McGrath completed match figures of 10-103. Laxman added 121 between tea and the close on the final day: only Victor Trumper (133 for Australia v South Africa at Melbourne in 1910-11) has scored more in a Test-match session. Ajit Agarkar fell first ball in the first innings, and second in the second. It was his second pair in a row, and meant he had now been dismissed five times in six balls - an unprecedented catalogue of disaster in Tests. Wisden Verdict Steve Waugh said after the game that he'd back his side against any team in any era. It's hard to disagree. South Africa v England First Test, Johannesburg, Nov 25-28 South Africa won by an innings and 21 runs England 122 (Donald 6-53, Pollock 4-16) and 260 (Stewart 86, Donald 5-74, Pollock 4-64) South Africa 403-9 declared (Gibbs 85, Cullinan 108, Klusener 72, Gough 5-70) Toss South Africa Debuts Adams, Hamilton, Vaughan (all England) On a wet pitch and in gloomy conditions, England slumped to a sensational 2-4 against Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock - and never recovered. It was the second-worst start in Test history (Fred Trueman reduced India to 0-4 at Headingley in 1952), and the most unreal beginning to a Test series ever. Michael Vaughan (33) showed composure and Andy Flintoff (38) genuine moments of class as England clawed their way back to 90-5, but another collapse soon followed, and England were in the field shortly before tea on the first day. South Africa gathered runs slowly to begin with, but Daryll Cullinan lifted the tempo with the classiest innings of the match, and Lance Klusener flogged the tiring bowlers as only he can. Hansie Cronje's declaration deprived Darren Gough the chance of a hat-trick - he will have to wait for his first ball of the second Test after dismissing Pollock and Donald with successive deliveries. Batting again, England lost Mike Atherton for his second duck of the game: it was his second pair in consecutive overseas Tests, following Melbourne last winter, and he now has 19 Test ducks, equalling Derek Underwood's England record. No other specialist batsman in history has as many. Alec Stewart mixed fortune with blazing cuts and drives, and Flintoff (36) again played attractively, before Andy Caddick (48) biffed his way to a Test-best. Gavin Hamilton became the first Englishman since Graham Gooch (against Australia at Edgbaston in 1975) to make a pair on debut. It was South Africa's biggest win against England and their 10th win on the trot at home. Wisden verdict England undone by the pitch and the best new-ball attack of the last decade. Winning the toss would only have lessened the margin of defeat. Second Test, Port Elizabeth, Dec 9-13 Drawn South Africa 450 (Cullinan 58, Rhodes 50, Klusener 174, Tufnell 4-124) and 224 for 4 decl. (Kallis 85*, Rhodes 57*) England 373 (Atherton 108, Hussain 82, Hayward 4-75) and 153 for 6 (Hussain 70*) Toss England Debuts Hayward (South Africa) England were left clinging on to a draw on a slow wicket that became more uneven as the game developed. It was the first time in ten home Tests that South Africa had failed to win - although home umpire Rudi Koertzen at times appeared to be doing his best to make it 11 victories in a row. Six disputed decisions - all to the detriment of England - almost brought South Africa a victory which the ultra-defensive captaincy of Hansie Cronje scarcely deserved. On the first day, South Africa were helped out of a hole (146 for 5) by an innings of unconfined violence from Lance Klusener, who once and for all made the transition from one-day biffer to Test-match destroyer. England replied with their best first-innings total since Brisbane, over a year ago, and Mike Atherton, on the back of four consecutive overseas ducks, hit their first Test hundred since Alec Stewart at Melbourne last Christmas. He added 155 for the second wicket with the vibrant Nasser Hussain, and took on the frightening pace of debutant Nantie Hayward with the gusto of old. South Africa were soon in trouble at 50 for 3 (it could have been 4 if the cameras had picked up Chris Adams's excellent reflex catch to dismiss Jacques Kallis), and opted for safety, dawdling 92.5 overs for 224 runs. Eventually, England were left 79 overs to survive (Cronje thus bizarrely denying himself the use of a second new ball), and got off to a poor start. But from 5 for 2, Hussain and Vaughan dug in. And by the time wickets started to fall near the close, it was too late for South Africa. Wisden verdict South Africa paid the price for going on the defensive too soon. England are beginning to make a habit of irritating them with rearguards - when will Cronje learn? Third Test, Durban, Dec 26-30 Drawn England 366 for 9 decl. (Hussain 146*, Stewart 95) South Africa 156 (Pollock 64, Caddick 7-46) and 572 for 7 (Kirsten 275, Kallis 69, Boucher 108) Toss England Debuts None A game that entered the final day with the possibility of an England win ended in a bore draw as Gary Kirsten equalled the South African individual Test record with an innings that lasted 22 minutes shy of 15 hours. It was the second-longest in Tests, after Hanif Mohammad's 970-minute epic for Pakistan v West Indies at Bridgetown in 1957-58 (Hanif himself claims it was 999). Kirsten added 192 for the fifth wicket with nightwatchman Mark Boucher to snuff out England's hopes of levelling the series. Nasser Hussain and Alec Stewart had earlier put on 158 for the fourth wicket - more than any England pair had added all year - before Andy Caddick, extracting bounce and movement where the South Africans had found none, recorded Test-best figures of 7-46, passing 100 wickets in the process. It gave England their first first-innings lead for 17 Tests, and allowed them to enforce their first follow-on since New Zealand at Old Trafford in 1994. But they got little change from a bone-dry pitch second time round, and were left to regret a Phil Tufnell no-ball, which would have trapped Kirsten plumb in front when he had 40. Wisden verdict England still unable to dominate for an entire Test. Fourth Test, Cape Town, Jan 2-5 South Africa won by an innings and 37 runs England 258 (Atherton 71, Donald 5-47) and 126 South Africa 421 (Kirsten 80, Kallis 105, Cullinan 120, Silverwood 5-91) Toss England Debuts None At 213 for 3 with half an hour to go on the first day, England were on top of the world. But things quickly went downhill. Allan Donald won a battle of wits with Alec Stewart, the rest followed meekly - even Lance Klusener got a wicket, his first of the series - and South Africa reached 200 for 1 by the second-day close. A mini fightback next day, led by the persevering Chris Silverwood, limited the deficit to 163 (as Cullinan reached his third century in consecutive Tests at Newlands), but England, batting a man short after Andy Flintoff broke his foot while bowling, performed like a team that believed they had already lost. All out for 126 - and another overseas series had gone begging. South Africa, led for the 50th time by Hansie Cronje, had never beaten England by so much. Donald's six wickets in the match took him to 86 in Tests - three more than SF Barnes's previous record for South Africa-England Tests. Mark Boucher simultaneously held his 100th Test catch and 200th first-class dismissal when he caught Nasser Hussain in the first innings, while Hussain became the first man to bat for more than 1000 minutes in Tests between dismissals. Wisden verdict England regress to dark old days. Fifth Test, Centurion, Jan 14-18 England won by 2 wickets South Africa 248 for 8 decl. (Klusener 61*) and second innings forfeited England 0-0 decl. and 251 for 8 (Stewart 73, Vaughan 69) Toss England Debuts Strydom (South Africa) The purists cried foul: for the first time in 1483 Tests, an innings was forfeited (two, in fact, although England later amended their forfeiture to 0-0 declared, so getting round Law 14, which makes no provision for a first-innings forfeiture). But England weren't complaining and duly scraped home with five balls and two wickets to spare after heavy rain had washed out the second, third and fourth days. They were grateful to two factors: the generosity of Hansie Cronje, whose target of 249 in 76 overs on a pitch that was flattening out was about as generous as he can ever have been; and a fifth-wicket stand of 126 between Alec Stewart and Michael Vaughan, who became the first man outside the big three of Stewart, Mike Atherton and Nasser Hussain to pass 50 in this series for England. At 228 for 4, England were walking it. But, true to form, they stumbled, losing four wickets for 12 as the pendulum swung South Africa's way.

      "body": "<p><strong>Olivia Drennan</strong>, 21, is a third-year history student at Cambridge University. Four years ago, she says, she had a stereotyped image of Oxbridge institutions - hundreds of miles from her Glasgow home - based largely on a reading of Brideshead Revisited. However, she was curious enough to travel down for the university open day and is now thankful that she did. </p> <p>\"When I got there it was a real revelation that the students were not all snobbish,\" she says. \"They were actually normal people. </p> <p>\"There is a big temptation for students in Scotland to stay put - at my school I would say that, of the 70 people who went to university, about 60 stayed at home and only two or three actually left Scotland. </p> <p>\"I was only allowed to go on one open day outside Glasgow during school time - which is daft. Schools should be encouraging pupils to look further afield.\" Despite the efforts of her teachers, Drennan managed to visit five universities before filling out her Ucas form. She chose to have a look at Edinburgh, Glasgow, St Andrews, Cambridge and Oxford based on their league table results and advice from friends and relatives. \"The open day at Edinburgh was perhaps the most informative. There were busloads of students arriving all day and it was very difficult to find out exactly where you were going. But every time you got lost there was someone around to point you in the right direction. </p> <p>\"When I got lost on a visit to Glasgow university I spent two hours trying to find the philosophy department and had to give up in as there was no one to ask.\" </p> <p>One of the main reasons she settled on Trinity Hall was because of the friendly atmosphere at a lunch on the open day. </p> <p><strong> Alan Senitt</strong>, 21, is a second year in physical education and community studies at Birmingham University. He discovered on open days that it is the people and the place - rather than any course syllabus - which gives a university its character. </p> <p>\"You read in a prospectus what a course involves,\" he says. \"But it is difficult to read in a book what it is going to be like living there. To find that out you have to visit. </p> <p>\"When a university publishes a prospectus they will take photos of the nicest parts of the city and the campus, but when you get there it is nothing like you expected,\" he explains. \"It's like McDonald's photographing their burgers to look amazing - when you actually get handed one it's not as attractive.\" </p> <p>Alan, who is from Pinner in north London, visited Birmingham, Liverpool John Moores, Durham, Leeds Metropolitan and Sunderland. </p> <p>He says that while most open days are useful, it can be hard getting a flavour of real student life. </p> <p>\"I got very bored at Liverpool when they sat us down for two hours and read through the entire syllabus. It's a shame, because the course looked really good. Durham was better because everyone got to stay overnight in halls and they organised activities and told us about different societies. It wasn't until the second day that we went to find out about the course. You are experiencing what university is like.\" </p> <p>As a Jewish student Alan also wanted to find a university town with a strong Jewish community. He was able to contact Jewish societies on open days and this helped him settle on Birmingham. </p> <p><strong> Ange Davison</strong>, 23, is a second-year postgraduate psychology student at York University. She says going to a few open days made her feel that she was bright enough to be an undergraduate. \"The whole idea of going to university and living on your own is intimidating and I always thought I would be out of my depth at a university full of posh people,\" she says. \"But it wasn't like that at all. Actually you may even discover that you're as bright as - or brighter than - some of the students who are already there.\" </p> <p>Davison's sixth-form college in Washington, Tyne and Wear, was very encouraging of students going on open day visits and she was able to visit Sheffield, Durham, Oxford, Teesside and York with a group of fellow students in the college minibus. It was the indescribable magic of York, however, which won her over as soon as she arrived. </p> <p>\"I just fell in love with the place,\" she says. \"I don't know what it is about it - it's all concrete buildings and bird mess - but I love it. I think it just has a very informal atmosphere. </p> <p>\"It was definitely the open day which made me choose York. The students who showed us around and gave us a copy of the alternative prospectus were surprisingly honest and didn't try to hide the bad aspects of the place. </p> <p>\"I remember a hall full of stalls for different societies - Amnesty International were there getting people to sign petitions, students were selling rag mags - there was a lot of activity and everything seemed to be going on there. Another thing I remember was having a few drinks in the college bar - which might be another reason I liked York.\"</p>",

You are experiencing what university is like.\" As a Jewish student Alan also wanted to find a university town with a strong Jewish community. He was able to contact Jewish societies on open days and this helped him settle on Birmingham. Ange Davison, 23, is a second-year postgraduate psychology student at York University. She says going to a few open days made her feel that she was bright enough to be an undergraduate. \"The whole idea of going to university and living on your own is intimidating and I always thought I would be out of my depth at a university full of posh people,\" she says. \"But it wasn't like that at all. Actually you may even discover that you're as bright as - or brighter than - some of the students who are already there.\" Davison's sixth-form college in Washington, Tyne and Wear, was very encouraging of students going on open day visits and she was able to visit Sheffield, Durham, Oxford, Teesside and York with a group of fellow students in the college minibus. It was the indescribable magic of York, however, which won her over as soon as she arrived. \"I just fell in love with the place,\" she says. \"I don't know what it is about it - it's all concrete buildings and bird mess - but I love it. I think it just has a very informal atmosphere. \"It was definitely the open day which made me choose York. The students who showed us around and gave us a copy of the alternative prospectus were surprisingly honest and didn't try to hide the bad aspects of the place. \"I remember a hall full of stalls for different societies - Amnesty International were there getting people to sign petitions, students were selling rag mags - there was a lot of activity and everything seemed to be going on there. Another thing I remember was having a few drinks in the college bar - which might be another reason I liked York.\"",

      "bodyText": "The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said today that he fully expects Zimbabwe to hold elections in May, as the troubled nation's parliament met for the final time before facing dissolution. In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Cook said that 11 other EU countries backed the British government, which has strongly criticised Mr Mugabe's tolerance of the mass occupation of white farmers' lands. The dissolution of Zimbabwe's 150-seat parliament is the first concrete step toward fixing a timetable for national elections, which Mr Mugabe had first said he would call in March, before postponing polling until April, and now May. An election date has yet to be set by the president, who is likely to face the biggest challenge to his rule since he led the nation to black majority rule and independence in 1980. Parliament's five-year term expires at midnight on 11 April and, under the constitution, elections must be held within four months of its last sitting. Mr Mugabe has assured British officials that voting would go ahead at an unspecified date in May, despite doubts about whether voters' lists and the three-month task of mapping out the boundaries of electoral constituencies could be completed in time. Mr Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party, which holds 147 seats in the 150-seat legislature, suffered its biggest defeat in February when 55% of voters rejected a Mugabe-approved revised constitution in a referendum. Eddison Zvobgo, Zanu-PF's senior legal affairs official, has predicted that the main opposition group, the Movement for Democratic Change, could win as many as 50 seats of the 120 that are being elected. President Mugabe is allowed to personally appoint 30. Zimbabwe is facing its worst economic crisis since the former British colony of Rhodesia became independent in 1980. Squatters led by veterans of the independence war have occupied more than 900 white-owned farms since early February, claiming plots for landless blacks. Mr Mugabe has described the occupations as a justified protest against ownership by 4,000 white people, who are mostly the descendants of British settlers, and has ordered police not to evict the armed squatters. Meanwhile, the leader of Zimbabwe's campaign to seize hundreds of farms claimed that white farmers had \"declared war\" on the country's black majority and vowed to defeat them. Chenjerai Hunzvi, chairman of the Zimbabwe national liberation war veterans association, said the invasion of white-owned farms would go on \"if the white people continue to be funny\". \"They have declared war on us by trying to mobilise racist and imperialist forces against our country, against the revolutionary forces of our country, the entire black people and our government, led by President Mugabe. We will not let them win this war,\" he said.",

This means that any successful attempt to amend or otherwise scupper the bill will not prevent it getting on to the statute book. Rather than see that happen, the Lords is likely to give the bill an unopposed second reading. The Lords has defied the House of Commons, which has repeatedly voted by significant majorities in favour of equality. Last week, Baroness Young, the Tory peer who has led cross-party opposition to the bill in the Lords, said that, if possible, she would try to amend the bill at its subsequent Lords committee stage. The baroness, who believes the bill poses a danger to children, described it as \"thoroughly bad\". \"I think one should at least try to get some amendments in it which would improve it. I would certainly want to strengthen some of the provisions on abuse of trust, which are very weak.\"",

Or rather, when I awoke at 3.30am from a nightmare (I was a roadie for the neo-punk band Mandy's Chinless Wonders , who had just had a big hit with Lymphomaniac), my neck and surrounding areas were drenched. After breakfast, I call the Grove surgery and am told that Dr Jarvis now does \"walk-in clinics\" on Mondays and Fridays, and would I like to pop in? No I would not.

The chances are, you would follow doctors' orders and put her on medication - though perhaps not so willingly if you watched last night's Panorama programme, which showed the dangers and limitations of giving stimulants to children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). </p> <p>A decade ago, Janice Hill's toddler was attacking her sister and trying to throw herself over the banister to see if she could fly. The GP mumbled something about \"terrible twos\", then when she continued to be terrible at three, four and five, he eventually referred her to psychiatric services where she was diagnosed with ADHD and offered methylphenidate, or MPH (commonly known as Ritalin). But Janice did not want her child on stimulant medication. Her eldest son's lactose intolerance had made her aware of the role of nutrition in controlling difficult behaviour. So she set about monitoring her daughter's diet. </p> <p>She sent blood samples to laboratories and consulted biochemists. The girl was deficient in various vitamins and minerals (B6 and zinc), essential fatty oils, and hydrochloric acid - so sugary cola drinks and artificial additives were eliminated from her diet, and supplements were added. But Janice's child, it turned out, was also poisoned. She had been exposed to organophosphates in sheep dip and also to lead, from the water pipes in the farm where the family used to live. </p> <p>It was an uphill struggle, but Janice cured her daughter. She did it defiantly, because she resented the doctors who labelled without looking into causes: \"No one ever examined her or asked about her medical history. If it hadn't been for my experiences with my eldest son's diet, I hate to think where my daughter would be now.\" She also learned better parenting skills: to be more patient through the difficult times. Janice now runs the Scottish mental health charity Overload, which is suing various NHS trusts on behalf of 34 parents whose children suffered adverse side effects on psychotropic medication. </p> <p>It is believed that up to 10% of children with an ADHD diagnosis can recover on a managed diet. In the UK, the Hyperactive Children's Support Group offers advice on diet and nutrition - so no parent needs to go it alone as Janice did. But for the remaining 90%, diet isn't the answer. </p> <p>And that's the difficulty of ADHD: it isn't easy to pin down. For some, diet, acupuncture, neurofeedback, osteopathy or homoeopathy can be the answer. For others, not. To focus too much on the physical aspect (specifically the unsubstantiated genetic hypothesis) can be to overlook emotional triggers. This means missing an opportunity to release the child from his or her distress, and a possible lifetime of medication. </p> <p>Take babies: they cannot verbalise anything, so very few parents realise how much babies feel. Closely observed, however, they show signs of terror and depression when abandoned or subjected to violent events. It's ironic that their emotions are least apparent in what may well be their most formative years. </p> <p>David, for instance, was two when his mother was beaten by her husband. She remarried, and circumstances changed for the better. Still, David grew into a difficult, hyperactive adolescent. Their GP prescribed medication and psychotherapy. But it wasn't just David who had to change. His parents had to consider his behaviour as something meaningful in itself, rather than the mere outcome of what may or may not have been his genetic predisposition for ADHD. This involved coming to terms with the painful details of the mother's first marriage, and revising their view that \"babies don't notice\". </p> <p>Under such emotionally charged conditions, the attraction of the \"brain disorder\" theory can be hard for parents to resist, especially as stimulant medication often has a dramatic effect - at least in the short term. But the trauma that underpinned David's hyperactivity had to be acknowledged if David was ever to be properly helped. And he needed help: his own hyperactivity so frightened him that, unusually, he requested medication to control himself. Psychotherapy helped him see that his ADHD expressed a constant wariness, a feeling of being on edge. He realised he didn't need to be that way any more. </p> <p>Children like David who receive emotional or behavioural support can come off medication, under close professional supervision. Dr Steve Baldwin, director of clinical and counselling training units (Cactus) at the University of Teesside, uses behavioural self-control training (BSCT) to cure ADHD-style behaviour. \"If the drug is withdrawn too suddenly, you can get 'rebound'. The carer imagines that this spiking of behaviour is the ADHD resurfacing, when in fact the child is showing normal drug withdrawal symptoms.\" </p> <p>When a child bullies others children, or disrupts classes, parents can feel tremendous pressure to medicate. But a behavioural therapist like Baldwin can teach the child self- control, by working closely with the parents to encourage appropriate behaviour whilst discouraging disruptive outbursts. After a few weeks, the child learns to behave, and the effect is usually long-lasting. </p> <p>Sometimes a resolution can be found just by withdrawing drug treatment, because stimulants themselves can cause disruption. Eleven-year old Mark, for instance, was given medication for ADHD. Initially, he improved, but after a few weeks, he started to relapse, fighting with his younger sister and displaying aggression which Baldwin recognised as a common side-effect of amphetamine-style drugs prescribed for ADHD. \"Before medication, Mark had developmental, growing-up type problems. One teacher reported he couldn't concentrate, the other said he was one of the best in class. He was moved to the front of the class, and his behaviour returned to normal. There was no reason to medicate him.\" </p> <p>One of Baldwin's concerns is to make a correct assessment. \"Children can be misdiagnosed with ADHD because it suits the needs of busy professionals, when in fact the children may have a developmental problem or a specific learning disability. Some have epilepsy. Others have poor eyesight or bad hearing. If you give them stimulants, you can create a new problem.\" Baldwin has seen many children think, on one hand, that they need the drug to control their behaviour and yet blame the drug for the way they act. \"They say, 'It's not me, it's the drug.'

      "body": "<p>Stephen is indisposed this week and has asked me to write his fitness column. He is feeling a little irked that people are not taking what he likes to see as his spiritual odyssey seriously: one colleague questioned his mental well-being when he admitted last time to feeling a kind of latent fascism; two friends thought the exercise kick was a substitute for a sex life; and the Guardian's editor said he was evidently having a mid-life crisis. If he wasn't depressed before, he certainly is now. He also took his liking for boxercise a little too far and did a few rounds in the ring: he now has a throbbing head, a tender nose and a bruised ego. </p> <p>He wanted me to tell you what a model client he has been and how I see the role of the personal trainer. The former is broadly true: he's had his emotional ups and downs but most of the time has been committed and enthusiastic. After 10 weeks, he is in much better shape physically and is now able to do things that were unimaginable at the beginning. He went on a 40-minute run last week - further than he'd run for 20 years - and said he felt he could have run for another 40. </p> <p>Exercising regularly is like anything: the better you become at it, the more you tend to enjoy it. Exercise will become a habit, and then a habit you don't want to do without. Sometimes it can become an obsession. I don't advocate this; my philosophy on exercise and nutrition is the same as that for life in general - moderation in all things. It's important not to be obsessed by weight loss or the way you look: it's how you feel that counts, and feeling good means a balanced diet and a sufficient amount of exercise. </p> <p>You will feel the benefit almost as soon as you start training, but it could be a couple of months before you start to see a major change. Training makes you feel more self-confident and more alive. Some people don't realise that until they start doing it; they come purely for the weight loss or muscle gain, but I try to get away from that and emphasise the way you feel mentally as well as physically. </p> <p>It's important to see clients regularly, say twice or three times a week. If you meet regularly, you are more at ease with each other and it's more productive. You can get to know people well, maybe even socialise with them, but you have to realise where to draw the line. I've never dated any of my clients and I'm keen to keep it that way. </p> <p>The important thing is to remember the objectives you have set. Seeing a client mustn't just become an opportunity to chat and gossip, though there may be times when the client has had a really bad day and you have to be supportive and willing to talk. But you shouldn't get too close; you have to keep a lid on the relationship. It shouldn't go beyond professional boundaries. </p> <p>Meeting a client for the first time is like a blind date. It's not someone you meet through a shared interest - most clients and trainers are at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of age, income and status - but that's one of the interesting things. First appearances can be deceptive: sometimes I've disliked a client on first meeting but come to like them later. Problems only arise if the client thinks he knows it all or is not sufficiently committed, or if he looks down on you or treats you as a servant. It has to be a relationship of equals; after all, the gym is a great leveller. </p> <p>I'd originally wanted to be a footballer and was an apprentice at Shrewsbury Town but that didn't work out (I was never quite quick enough) and I went to the US on a soccer scholarship. I'd always kept myself fit, and got interested in coaching and personal training over there. I like to think it's because I want to help people; anyone who is just doing it for himself is eventually going to be found out. </p> <p>After finishing my degree in physical education I worked as a trainer in the US, before moving back to the UK two years ago. We lag behind the US in the acceptance of training: here it's viewed as a rich person's toy and some people are embarrassed to tell their friends they've got a trainer, but in the US it is much more accepted - go to Central Park and you will see 50 trainers at work. There are more training companies and training-based gyms, and there is more in-home training and group exercise. </p> <p>It's important for a trainer not to have too many clients or to do too many sessions in a row. I try to treat each client as if they are my first of the day. That's hard to do when you are tired, but you have to remember why they're coming - they're coming for help and advice and they expect you to be on form. Sometimes it's hard: if I do eight people in a day it gets tough. You can burn out and feel yourself thinking, \"I don't want to deal with these people any more\"; some days you go home at night and you just can't bear to be nice to your friends and flatmates.

      "bodyText": "Stephen is indisposed this week and has asked me to write his fitness column. He is feeling a little irked that people are not taking what he likes to see as his spiritual odyssey seriously: one colleague questioned his mental well-being when he admitted last time to feeling a kind of latent fascism; two friends thought the exercise kick was a substitute for a sex life; and the Guardian's editor said he was evidently having a mid-life crisis. If he wasn't depressed before, he certainly is now. He also took his liking for boxercise a little too far and did a few rounds in the ring: he now has a throbbing head, a tender nose and a bruised ego. He wanted me to tell you what a model client he has been and how I see the role of the personal trainer. The former is broadly true: he's had his emotional ups and downs but most of the time has been committed and enthusiastic. After 10 weeks, he is in much better shape physically and is now able to do things that were unimaginable at the beginning. He went on a 40-minute run last week - further than he'd run for 20 years - and said he felt he could have run for another 40. Exercising regularly is like anything: the better you become at it, the more you tend to enjoy it. Exercise will become a habit, and then a habit you don't want to do without. Sometimes it can become an obsession. I don't advocate this; my philosophy on exercise and nutrition is the same as that for life in general - moderation in all things.

Rumours as to the possible outcome remain contradictory. So it's not surprising to find Galatasaray putting the case for the defence today.</p> <p>Club president Faruk Suren led the charge, responded to Peter Ridsdale's accusations of insensitivity by offering his sympathies to the families of the murdered Leeds fans. He also promised to follow whatever decision Uefa eventually makes. \"While we think it is unfair that this matter carries on and that Turkish supporters should not be allowed to travel, we will come and play without our supporters if that is what Uefa decide,\" he told Radio 5 Live.</p> <p>After the humility came further defensive gestures. The club's general secretary Sinan Kalpikciolu said that as the events had occurred away from the stadium they had \"nothing to do with football or Galatasaray\". Club captain Gica Popescu claimed the crimes took place in Istanbul's answer to Compton. \"The incident happened in the most dangerous zone of Istanbul - not a place where anybody would be advised to go\", he said of the Taksim Square area which has alternatively been described as the city's entertainment district.</p> <p>Popescu went on to remind Britons that \"Here in Turkey people are genuinely distressed by what happened.\" A heart-warming sentiment, but one that varies substantially from that of vice-president Senes Erizik. Erizik claimed today that the deaths were the responsibility of a minority of Leeds fans. \"The achieved their goal,\" he said. \"On the night they were the provokers.\" We await Uefa's decision with interest.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>AN ATTEMPT TO ENCOURAGE SALES</strong></p> <p>20% off 10 classic top footy books from BOL!!!

Today he's the subject of a \u00a310m bid from AC Milan, and David Pleat is wearing the glitter to make himself look more alluring to big-name strikers. Ladies and gentlemen, we give you Sergei Rebrov.</p> <p>The man who was expected to link Steffen Freund with Chris Armstrong has been the subject of transfer speculation all season - ever since he showed that he could still score goals in the absence of strike partner Andrei Shevchenko. Rebrov scored eight times in Big Cup this season, and his reward looks to be a reunion with Shevchenko in surroundings rather more glamorous than Kiev's Grushevskii Street.</p> <p>Milan have made their move after reports suggested they weren't the only big club chasing Rebrov. Spurs were also supposed to be interested. But Milan have always had first dibs on Rebrov and, along with Valencia's midfield star Gerard, he is likely to be one of the key components in the summer rebuilding plans at the San Siro.

Rumours as to the possible outcome remain contradictory. So it's not surprising to find Galatasaray putting the case for the defence today. Club president Faruk Suren led the charge, responded to Peter Ridsdale's accusations of insensitivity by offering his sympathies to the families of the murdered Leeds fans. He also promised to follow whatever decision Uefa eventually makes. \"While we think it is unfair that this matter carries on and that Turkish supporters should not be allowed to travel, we will come and play without our supporters if that is what Uefa decide,\" he told Radio 5 Live. After the humility came further defensive gestures. The club's general secretary Sinan Kalpikciolu said that as the events had occurred away from the stadium they had \"nothing to do with football or Galatasaray\". Club captain Gica Popescu claimed the crimes took place in Istanbul's answer to Compton. \"The incident happened in the most dangerous zone of Istanbul - not a place where anybody would be advised to go\", he said of the Taksim Square area which has alternatively been described as the city's entertainment district. Popescu went on to remind Britons that \"Here in Turkey people are genuinely distressed by what happened.\" A heart-warming sentiment, but one that varies substantially from that of vice-president Senes Erizik. Erizik claimed today that the deaths were the responsibility of a minority of Leeds fans. \"The achieved their goal,\" he said. \"On the night they were the provokers.\" We await Uefa's decision with interest. * * * * * * * * * * * * * AN ATTEMPT TO ENCOURAGE SALES 20% off 10 classic top footy books from BOL!!!

Today he's the subject of a \u00a310m bid from AC Milan, and David Pleat is wearing the glitter to make himself look more alluring to big-name strikers. Ladies and gentlemen, we give you Sergei Rebrov. The man who was expected to link Steffen Freund with Chris Armstrong has been the subject of transfer speculation all season - ever since he showed that he could still score goals in the absence of strike partner Andrei Shevchenko. Rebrov scored eight times in Big Cup this season, and his reward looks to be a reunion with Shevchenko in surroundings rather more glamorous than Kiev's Grushevskii Street. Milan have made their move after reports suggested they weren't the only big club chasing Rebrov. Spurs were also supposed to be interested. But Milan have always had first dibs on Rebrov and, along with Valencia's midfield star Gerard, he is likely to be one of the key components in the summer rebuilding plans at the San Siro.

So thank God for the return of the top flight's top two top scouse scallies - yes, Robbie Fowler and Francis Jeffers are on their way back to the Premiership. Snort! Robbie, whose best display this season was a sheepish televised apology for his touchline antics during a Merseyside derby, has not played since Boxing Day. Sniff! The staunch heterosexual will return in Liverpool's reserve match at Bradford tonight. Slap! Francis, who made his mark on this campaign by weakly wafting his hands around Sander Westerveld's head during a(nother) Merseyside derby, has been injured since an England U-21 game at Fulham in February. Smack! He's been earmarked - stop sniggering - to play for Everton reserves at Leeds this evening. Both players are likely to return to their respective first teams for... oh lordy... the Merseyside derby on Good Friday. Clobber! Clank! Cosh!

The \u00a320m-rated PSV Eindhoven star, who has attracted the interest of Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea, told the Express: \"If none of the clubs interested in me open discussions with PSV by the start of May, I'll stay another year in Holland. I will sign the improved contract PSV have put before me.\" Gordon Strachan is after Romanian international midfielder Constantin Galca. The defensive midfielder who plays for Primera Liga side Espanyol, will be out of contract this summer, and Strachan looks set to pounce. Sheffield Wednesday defender Peter Atherton could move back to Wigan Athletic, his hometown club, this summer. Relegation-bound Wednesday are looking to offload a number of players to cut their wage bill, and captain Atherton would jump at the chance to move to rejoin the Latics if they are promoted. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF West Ham are close to agreeing a \u00a34m deal for Lyon's Frederic Kanoute, currently on loan at Upton Park.

Bolton have been fined \u00a345,000 by the Football League for poaching manager Sam Allardyce from Notts County last October. They are considering an appeal. John Duncan has been sacked as manager of Chesterfield. The Spireites are currently nine points adrift at the bottom of the Second Division and have won just five of their 40 league games this season. Everton will ban for life any fans they can identify as having hurled racist abuse at Leicester's Turkish midfielder Muzzy Izzet. \"I have written to both the chairman of Leicester and the player,\" said Everton chairman Philip Carter, \"and I have asked if there are any instances that have been recorded where they were able to identify individuals then we should know about it.\" Rangers boss Dick Advocaat has been named the Bank of Scotland SPL Manager of the month for March. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Channel 4: Football Italia (2.10am) Watch Fabrizio Ravanelli feed Attilio Lombardo.

They are the so-called Falash Mura, descendants of local Jews who converted to Christianity, and now want to embrace Judaism again as their ticket to Israel.</p> <p>There are an estimated 26,000 Falash Mura, of whom some 18,000 have abandoned their homes and now live in squalid transit camps in Addis Ababa and the northern city of Gondar.</p> <p>Their status is hotly controversial in Israel, which is struggling to assimilate hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the former Soviet Union - among them Natan Sharansky.</p> <p>More than 50,000 Ethiopian Jews already live in Israel. Many were secretly whisked out of their homeland during the Mengistu dictatorship. Although they have been officially welcomed and given full citizenship, most of the community live in visibly poorer circumstances than other Israelis.</p> <p>That does not deter the Falash Mura, who are determined to escape the infinitely poorer conditions of Ethiopia. Many have Jewish relatives already in Israel, but proving their relationship is desperately hard in a land where identity documents are scarce or non-existent.</p> <p>Some of the Falash Mura have endured the squalor of the transit camps for years. They study Judaism and Hebrew in their anxiety to prove their allegiance, but only a trickle are rewarded with Israeli passports.</p> <p>Sharansky has expressed sympathy with their plight. \"I was in jail in Russia for nine years because I wanted to reach Israel,\" he told one group. But, he added, Israel could not accept everyone who wanted to come.</p> <p>Israel's Law of Return, which lies at the core of the state's very existence, says that anyone with a Jewish grandparent can settle in the Jewish state. But halachic, or religious, law specifies that a person can be Jewish only if he or she has a Jewish mother. Within the tidal wave of post-Soviet immigration, there are thousands of non-Jews with only a tenuous claim to citizenship of Israel.</p> <p>To complicate the issue still further, there are bitter disputes between rabbinical authorities about the conversion of gentiles. Some orthodox Jews believe that conversion is impossible. Liberal opinion holds it to be perfectly permissible.</p> <p>Underlying the arcane debates about Jewishness is an uncomfortable if rarely voiced suspicion that Israel is holding the Falash Mura at arm's length because they are poor - and black.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://wwww.reliefweb.int/w/rwb.nsf/ByCountry/Ethiopia?OpenDocument&amp;Star tKey=Ethiopia&amp;Expandview\" target=\"_new\">Ethiopian famine links</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/nw-srv/issue/21_98b/tnw/today/ps/ps01mo_1.htm\" target=\"_new\">W ho's a Jew?</a><br> <a href=\"http://jta.virtualjerusalem.com/index.exe/0004055\" target=\"_new\">Virtual Jerusalem coverage</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.jafi.org.il\" target=\"_new\">Jewish Agency</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/Judaism/ethiopia.html\" target=\"_new\">Ethiopian Jews</a><br> <a href=\"http://israeliculture.about.com/msub30.htm\" target=\"_new\">Websites on Ethiopian Jewry</a><br> <a href=\"http://israeliculture.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www.v irtual.co.il/communities/wjcbook/ethiopia/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Jewish communities of the world</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.wjc.org.il/dis6chan.htm\" target=\"_new\">The immigration debate</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/demographics.html\" target=\"_new\">Is raeli population statistics</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post daily</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.haaretzdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Ha'aretz daily</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.jrep.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Report magazine</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Israeli interior minister Natan Sharansky is in Ethiopia, holding out hope for thousands of its dispossessed and suffering citizens. But these are not famine victims. They are the so-called Falash Mura, descendants of local Jews who converted to Christianity, and now want to embrace Judaism again as their ticket to Israel. There are an estimated 26,000 Falash Mura, of whom some 18,000 have abandoned their homes and now live in squalid transit camps in Addis Ababa and the northern city of Gondar. Their status is hotly controversial in Israel, which is struggling to assimilate hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the former Soviet Union - among them Natan Sharansky. More than 50,000 Ethiopian Jews already live in Israel. Many were secretly whisked out of their homeland during the Mengistu dictatorship. Although they have been officially welcomed and given full citizenship, most of the community live in visibly poorer circumstances than other Israelis. That does not deter the Falash Mura, who are determined to escape the infinitely poorer conditions of Ethiopia. Many have Jewish relatives already in Israel, but proving their relationship is desperately hard in a land where identity documents are scarce or non-existent. Some of the Falash Mura have endured the squalor of the transit camps for years. They study Judaism and Hebrew in their anxiety to prove their allegiance, but only a trickle are rewarded with Israeli passports. Sharansky has expressed sympathy with their plight. \"I was in jail in Russia for nine years because I wanted to reach Israel,\" he told one group. But, he added, Israel could not accept everyone who wanted to come. Israel's Law of Return, which lies at the core of the state's very existence, says that anyone with a Jewish grandparent can settle in the Jewish state. But halachic, or religious, law specifies that a person can be Jewish only if he or she has a Jewish mother. Within the tidal wave of post-Soviet immigration, there are thousands of non-Jews with only a tenuous claim to citizenship of Israel. To complicate the issue still further, there are bitter disputes between rabbinical authorities about the conversion of gentiles. Some orthodox Jews believe that conversion is impossible. Liberal opinion holds it to be perfectly permissible. Underlying the arcane debates about Jewishness is an uncomfortable if rarely voiced suspicion that Israel is holding the Falash Mura at arm's length because they are poor - and black.

      "body": "<p>If Richard Smith had been looking for a metaphor for how his reputation has withered and his work become discarded, for how (as he believes) he has been written out of recent British art history, he found an indelible one a couple of Thursdays ago, on a fleeting visit to London from his home in New York. </p> <p>Every British artist - \"living and dead\", as Smith puts it - had been invited to turn up at a picture-call to mark the relaunch of the Tate Gallery as Tate Britain. Smith had a career retrospective at the Tate in 1975, when he was still in his 40s. A number of his pantechnicon-sized, three-dimensional \"constructed\" canvases are in the permanent collection. </p> <p>And he duly took his place on the steps at Millbank alongside the great and the good, the young and not-so-young Turks, the ennobled and bearded grandees, freighted with reputation and achievement. Present were some of the eminent pop-ists who with Richard Smith invented pop art in this country in the late 50s. Peter Blake was there, and so was Patrick Caulfield. Also present was Smith's old friend and former Wiltshire neighbour, Sir Howard Hodgkin, who, in the years that Smith's standing has been steadily eroded, has made himself enormously famous and important. </p> <p>The PR persons with the clip-boards had ticked off who had turned up and who hadn't, the artists had been whipped into some sort of order, the snappers had been assembled beneath the scrubbed-up portico... and suddenly there was a stampede away from the official picture opportunity in the direction of another one that had unexpectedly presented itself. Tracey Emin in a biker jacket and brassy jewellery had arrived in a taxi. Smiles froze on the faces of the official group. \"Tracey, give us a smile, Tracey...\" Mad Tracey from Margate, whose career still has a lot of heat under it. Our lady of the photo op. \"Give me eyes, Tracey!\" Smiles broadened on the faces of the PR contingent. Aluminium ladders crashed. Pandemonium. </p> <p>But enough of symbolism. The reality for Smith was even crueller. When he wandered inside to take a look at the radical new rehang, it brought home to him that - while there were Hodgkins and Peter Blakes and Hockneys (a whole room full of Hockneys, his stablemate at the Marquess of Dufferin and Ava-backed Kasmin Gallery in New Bond Street throughout the 60s) - there were no Smiths on display. No Gift Wrap; no Flip Top. None of the extraordinary, bulking, built-out paintings that he came under particularly heavy attack for in the early 60s, accused of strengthening advertising's success by taking it, in the form of abstracted Salem and Philip Morris cigarette packets, as his subject. His best paintings were generally large, sharing a sense of scale with cinema and billboard advertising where, as Smith said at the time, \"you could drown in a glass of beer and live in a semi-detached cigarette packet\". </p> <p>Twenty years later, at the main tobacco-sponsored tournaments during the heyday of televised snooker, where the sets echoed the brand \"livery\" and product packaging, it often looked as if the players were walking around inside a Dick Smith painting. </p> <p>So he was invisible in terms of his work at the Tate, and almost invisible in his person. Two recent, massively invasive operations on his heart have left him looking frail and almost transparent. He has apparently always been quiet and self-effacing. I remember seeing him many years ago at the movable piss-up that is the Venice Biennale. Howard Hodgkin was the official British representative that year and he was being supported by a roistering group of friends who included Mick Moon, Patrick Caulfield and John Hoyland, plus a man with a rather shuffling, grey, careworn air, who turned out to be Dick Smith. </p> <p>Just 14 years earlier it had all been very different. In 1970, Smith was the official British artist in Venice. Bernard Jacobson, his current London dealer, remembers being smitten at that time by the glamour surrounding Smith and his American wife, Betsy. \"I always thought of him as being like [Scott] Fitzgerald. They were the beautiful people. They had everything. I remember the millionaires all wanting to meet Richard Smith at Venice. I mean real millionaires. Oil millionaires. Multi-millionaires, all over him. The party at Cipriani was amazing: one prominent gallery owner snorting up under the trees, Robert Fraser fixing up, lakes of champagne. </p> <p>\"In the 70s,\" Jacobson adds, \"the market was very, very strong. Stronger than the 60s. The 60s were very, very glamorous. But people were buying in the 70s, when you had the big collectors jumping on board. And Dick was part of that. He was a star.\" </p> <p> The world, however, moves on. Although stars may shine for ever, stardom always fades. And in an art world that has been described as being like a carnival with a casino attached, it has a tendency to fade faster than in other arenas. It can be brutal. Up like a rocket, down like a stick. \"It's the difference between being recognised in restaurants and being talked about in restaurants,\" as Louis Menand wrote recently in the New Yorker. \"It's the difference between being in evidence and being inevitable.\" </p> <p>By 1984, Smith's allure had dulled. The spotlight had shifted. His prices were faltering. \"It's when I took up smoking again.\" he told me, \"in Venice for Howard in 84. After that, I was hooked for another many years.\" </p> <p>We met for lunch at the Ivy, in London. It is a kind of shrine to the artists of Smith's generation - a Joe Tilson painting on wood is the centrepiece in the bar; paintings by Caulfield, Blake, Hodgkin and Allen Jones line the walls. All his friends. But no Dick Smith. Again Dick Smith was invisible. Just as you will look in vain for him in most recent books on post-war British art. </p> <p>He arrived before me. I couldn't help noticing that he had positioned himself in such a way that he was looking at one of the Ivy's opaque, leaded windows with its shifting shadows of passing pedestrians, and not directly at any painting. Chris Corbin, who meets and greets at the Ivy at lunchtimes, pressing the flesh of the famous and familiar, schmoozing the hot and happening, failed to materialise at our table. </p> <p>Smith was born in the commuter- belt in Hertfordshire in 1931. His father was employed at the House of Commons as a printer on Hansard, working nights. Smith did his national service in the RAF, stationed in Hong Kong. And then - like Eduardo Paolozzi, Richard Hamilton and other members of the Independent Group at the ICA half a generation earlier - he got fired up by everything bright and synthetic and American. Living in a country still in the grip of austerity and rationing, he fell in love with the subversive glamour of America. </p> <p>He was an affront to his teachers at the Royal College of Art, where he started in 1954, on two counts: his paintings were big and splashy and content-free at a time when English painting was still very pastoral, in the landscape tradition; still ruled by \"good taste\" and common sense. This was especially the case after he had seen the Klines and Pollocks and other abstract expressionist pictures that came to the Tate as part of a hugely influential show of American art in 1956. And then on top of that, he gave them deliberately poppy, throwaway titles like Everly, Staggerly, Packet of Ten, Special Offer. His work was hard-nosed, anti-romantic and urban. He has come to be seen as a precursor of the generation of pop artists that included Allen Jones, Derek Boshier, Pauline Boty, Caulfield and Hockney, which emerged at the Royal College between 1959-62. </p> <p>He was a thinker. His work had a pronounced intellectual, as well as a purely visceral, dimension. He wrote articles for Ark, the RCA magazine, on men's fashion - \"The male image at mid-century\" - and interior design in the movies. Smith shared a flat-cum-studio with Peter Blake in his second year at the RCA, and then again for two years after he left the college in 1957. When Terence Conran's Soup Kitchen opened on Fleet Street in the late 1950s, it featured a letter-collage mural by Smith and Blake. Michael Chow would later commission Smith to design installations for his restaurant in Los Angeles, and Chow and Conran have remained two of his biggest supporters. </p> <p>He went with Peter Blake to see Bill Haley at the Kingston Empire, and Johnny Ray, the \"Nabob of Sob\", at the London Palladium. \"It was really scraping around,\" he says of their truffling for pop culture in London in the mid-50s. \"It seems funny now, but you really had to search it out.\" In order to feel American - urban and out there and modern - Smith decided it was important to look American. \"You liked to dress in an American way, which was immensely problematical. I had a buzzcut. Gerry Mulligan. Gerry Mulligan had a great haircut. Wonderful haircut.\" </p> <p>Smith's lifelong subject was to be surface appearance: the resounding shallows of consumer culture; the complex sheen of advertising and packaging. The artists of the first phase of British pop used popular material objectively. Smith and the artists of the second phase shifted their attention to the shrieking, jabbering mediated environment itself. </p> <p>\"I was always an abstract painter,\" he says. \"So I was to do with form and mood and shape and colour. I had no icon. I wasn't into being very specific about the imagery. I didn't want to make it that explicit. Mainstream pop was all about supermarkets and stuff. Low-grade, debased imagery. What intrigued me wasn't the nitty-gritty, down dirty popular culture. It was the high end. These beautiful ads for Smirnoff vodka and glamorous films and store windows and Cinemascope. The upscale. It was an uptown, smart kind of culture that would drive my art.\" </p> <p>For the 15 years up to his 1975 Tate retrospective, Smith's life seemed charmed. A Harkness Fellowship took him to New York for two years at the beginning of the 60s. Transplanted from a bedsit studio in Turnham Green to a high-ceilinged, light-filled industrial space in lower Manhattan, his work became correspondingly optimistic and expansive. It spread outwards across the wall, and eventually, on three-dimensional constructed canvases, out into the room. He made a series of paintings based on billboards in Times Square, and gave them titles like Chase Manhattan, Revlon and McCalls. \"Richard's paintings had a breathiness and colour and a kind of newness absolutely separate from pop art,\" Richard Bellamy, his New York dealer in those days, has said. \"Those paintings were suffused with light, a different kind of light than I had ever seen.\" </p> <p>Back in London, he was visited by John Lennon at his studio in Hoxton, an area then still untouched even by beatnik bohemia; they listened to Motown, hung out. Ken Russell used the studio for the final party section in his film about the British pop artists, Pop Goes the Easel. Smith had a big show at the Whitechapel in 1966, and won the Grand Prize at the Sao Paolo Biennale two years later. He used the money to buy a spread in Wiltshire. \"You had that Wiltshire country life,\" he says, \"with Howard [Hodgkin] 20 miles away in this stunning house. This mill. Joe Tilson, John Hoyland. Robyn Denny was living in Bath. You know, it was that. I had a big studio in a schoolhouse. I was the right kind of artist for that kind of time. I just expected to be in international group shows. Then... I don't know.\" </p> <p>In Britain, in the years after his retrospective at the Tate, it all suddenly started to go quiet. In 1978, he decided to sell up and move with his wife and son to Manhattan. There was a glamorous three-storey loft in Tribeca. A house in Teluride in Colorado for the skiing. And the other snow - the cocaine. He got heavily into it for a period following his return to America. \"There was a lot of it about. Max's Kansas City was going, and the [Warhol] Factory, and I had lots of artist friends. It was there and I started to buy it. Then I tried to turn people on. I was romantic about it, but it didn't mean being a drug-head. It was a passing phase.\" </p> <p>He says it was the long winters skiing and the intrusive social life that eventually started to give him the feeling that he wasn't minding the store. \"I think Dick got too close,\" Bernard Jacobson says. \"Like [Scott] Fitzgerald in Antibes.\" Plus Kasmin in London had shut up shop, and the Feigen Gallery in New York had gone over to old masters. Which meant there was nobody stoking the star-maker machinery, turning him into one of those remembered names. </p> <p>\"To be successful as an artist, you have to have your work shown in a good gallery for the same reason that, say, Dior never sold his originals from a counter in Woolworth's,\" Andy Warhol once wrote. \"You need a good gallery so the 'ruling class' will notice you and spread enough confidence in your future so collectors will buy you, whether for $500 or $50,000.\" </p> <p>Smith's is no hard-luck story. He is looking forward to a show at Tate Britain next year to mark his 70th birthday, and is still painting every day. He lives comfortably in SoHo. But in 1997, he swapped his place for Gary Hume's place in Hoxton. That was the summer of Sensation and the accompanying mania. It gave him a glimpse of what he had and how it can go. </p> <p>David Bowie has Dick Smiths in his collection. The Bowie who wrote: \"Fame - what you get is no tomorrow.\" </p> <p>\"Robyn Denny keeps saying, 'Our time will come, Dick. Our time will come.' And he's been saying this for years and years,\" Smith says. \"Years and years and years.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "If Richard Smith had been looking for a metaphor for how his reputation has withered and his work become discarded, for how (as he believes) he has been written out of recent British art history, he found an indelible one a couple of Thursdays ago, on a fleeting visit to London from his home in New York. Every British artist - \"living and dead\", as Smith puts it - had been invited to turn up at a picture-call to mark the relaunch of the Tate Gallery as Tate Britain. Smith had a career retrospective at the Tate in 1975, when he was still in his 40s. A number of his pantechnicon-sized, three-dimensional \"constructed\" canvases are in the permanent collection. And he duly took his place on the steps at Millbank alongside the great and the good, the young and not-so-young Turks, the ennobled and bearded grandees, freighted with reputation and achievement. Present were some of the eminent pop-ists who with Richard Smith invented pop art in this country in the late 50s. Peter Blake was there, and so was Patrick Caulfield. Also present was Smith's old friend and former Wiltshire neighbour, Sir Howard Hodgkin, who, in the years that Smith's standing has been steadily eroded, has made himself enormously famous and important. The PR persons with the clip-boards had ticked off who had turned up and who hadn't, the artists had been whipped into some sort of order, the snappers had been assembled beneath the scrubbed-up portico... and suddenly there was a stampede away from the official picture opportunity in the direction of another one that had unexpectedly presented itself. Tracey Emin in a biker jacket and brassy jewellery had arrived in a taxi. Smiles froze on the faces of the official group. \"Tracey, give us a smile, Tracey...\" Mad Tracey from Margate, whose career still has a lot of heat under it. Our lady of the photo op. \"Give me eyes, Tracey!\" Smiles broadened on the faces of the PR contingent. Aluminium ladders crashed. Pandemonium. But enough of symbolism. The reality for Smith was even crueller. When he wandered inside to take a look at the radical new rehang, it brought home to him that - while there were Hodgkins and Peter Blakes and Hockneys (a whole room full of Hockneys, his stablemate at the Marquess of Dufferin and Ava-backed Kasmin Gallery in New Bond Street throughout the 60s) - there were no Smiths on display. No Gift Wrap; no Flip Top. None of the extraordinary, bulking, built-out paintings that he came under particularly heavy attack for in the early 60s, accused of strengthening advertising's success by taking it, in the form of abstracted Salem and Philip Morris cigarette packets, as his subject. His best paintings were generally large, sharing a sense of scale with cinema and billboard advertising where, as Smith said at the time, \"you could drown in a glass of beer and live in a semi-detached cigarette packet\". Twenty years later, at the main tobacco-sponsored tournaments during the heyday of televised snooker, where the sets echoed the brand \"livery\" and product packaging, it often looked as if the players were walking around inside a Dick Smith painting. So he was invisible in terms of his work at the Tate, and almost invisible in his person. Two recent, massively invasive operations on his heart have left him looking frail and almost transparent. He has apparently always been quiet and self-effacing. I remember seeing him many years ago at the movable piss-up that is the Venice Biennale. Howard Hodgkin was the official British representative that year and he was being supported by a roistering group of friends who included Mick Moon, Patrick Caulfield and John Hoyland, plus a man with a rather shuffling, grey, careworn air, who turned out to be Dick Smith. Just 14 years earlier it had all been very different. In 1970, Smith was the official British artist in Venice. Bernard Jacobson, his current London dealer, remembers being smitten at that time by the glamour surrounding Smith and his American wife, Betsy. \"I always thought of him as being like [Scott] Fitzgerald. They were the beautiful people. They had everything. I remember the millionaires all wanting to meet Richard Smith at Venice. I mean real millionaires. Oil millionaires. Multi-millionaires, all over him. The party at Cipriani was amazing: one prominent gallery owner snorting up under the trees, Robert Fraser fixing up, lakes of champagne. \"In the 70s,\" Jacobson adds, \"the market was very, very strong. Stronger than the 60s. The 60s were very, very glamorous. But people were buying in the 70s, when you had the big collectors jumping on board. And Dick was part of that. He was a star.\" The world, however, moves on. Although stars may shine for ever, stardom always fades. And in an art world that has been described as being like a carnival with a casino attached, it has a tendency to fade faster than in other arenas. It can be brutal. Up like a rocket, down like a stick. \"It's the difference between being recognised in restaurants and being talked about in restaurants,\" as Louis Menand wrote recently in the New Yorker. \"It's the difference between being in evidence and being inevitable.\" By 1984, Smith's allure had dulled. The spotlight had shifted. His prices were faltering. \"It's when I took up smoking again.\" he told me, \"in Venice for Howard in 84. After that, I was hooked for another many years.\" We met for lunch at the Ivy, in London. It is a kind of shrine to the artists of Smith's generation - a Joe Tilson painting on wood is the centrepiece in the bar; paintings by Caulfield, Blake, Hodgkin and Allen Jones line the walls. All his friends. But no Dick Smith. Again Dick Smith was invisible. Just as you will look in vain for him in most recent books on post-war British art. He arrived before me. I couldn't help noticing that he had positioned himself in such a way that he was looking at one of the Ivy's opaque, leaded windows with its shifting shadows of passing pedestrians, and not directly at any painting. Chris Corbin, who meets and greets at the Ivy at lunchtimes, pressing the flesh of the famous and familiar, schmoozing the hot and happening, failed to materialise at our table. Smith was born in the commuter- belt in Hertfordshire in 1931. His father was employed at the House of Commons as a printer on Hansard, working nights. Smith did his national service in the RAF, stationed in Hong Kong. And then - like Eduardo Paolozzi, Richard Hamilton and other members of the Independent Group at the ICA half a generation earlier - he got fired up by everything bright and synthetic and American. Living in a country still in the grip of austerity and rationing, he fell in love with the subversive glamour of America. He was an affront to his teachers at the Royal College of Art, where he started in 1954, on two counts: his paintings were big and splashy and content-free at a time when English painting was still very pastoral, in the landscape tradition; still ruled by \"good taste\" and common sense. This was especially the case after he had seen the Klines and Pollocks and other abstract expressionist pictures that came to the Tate as part of a hugely influential show of American art in 1956. And then on top of that, he gave them deliberately poppy, throwaway titles like Everly, Staggerly, Packet of Ten, Special Offer. His work was hard-nosed, anti-romantic and urban. He has come to be seen as a precursor of the generation of pop artists that included Allen Jones, Derek Boshier, Pauline Boty, Caulfield and Hockney, which emerged at the Royal College between 1959-62. He was a thinker. His work had a pronounced intellectual, as well as a purely visceral, dimension. He wrote articles for Ark, the RCA magazine, on men's fashion - \"The male image at mid-century\" - and interior design in the movies. Smith shared a flat-cum-studio with Peter Blake in his second year at the RCA, and then again for two years after he left the college in 1957. When Terence Conran's Soup Kitchen opened on Fleet Street in the late 1950s, it featured a letter-collage mural by Smith and Blake. Michael Chow would later commission Smith to design installations for his restaurant in Los Angeles, and Chow and Conran have remained two of his biggest supporters. He went with Peter Blake to see Bill Haley at the Kingston Empire, and Johnny Ray, the \"Nabob of Sob\", at the London Palladium. \"It was really scraping around,\" he says of their truffling for pop culture in London in the mid-50s. \"It seems funny now, but you really had to search it out.\" In order to feel American - urban and out there and modern - Smith decided it was important to look American. \"You liked to dress in an American way, which was immensely problematical. I had a buzzcut. Gerry Mulligan. Gerry Mulligan had a great haircut. Wonderful haircut.\" Smith's lifelong subject was to be surface appearance: the resounding shallows of consumer culture; the complex sheen of advertising and packaging. The artists of the first phase of British pop used popular material objectively. Smith and the artists of the second phase shifted their attention to the shrieking, jabbering mediated environment itself. \"I was always an abstract painter,\" he says. \"So I was to do with form and mood and shape and colour. I had no icon. I wasn't into being very specific about the imagery. I didn't want to make it that explicit. Mainstream pop was all about supermarkets and stuff. Low-grade, debased imagery. What intrigued me wasn't the nitty-gritty, down dirty popular culture. It was the high end. These beautiful ads for Smirnoff vodka and glamorous films and store windows and Cinemascope. The upscale. It was an uptown, smart kind of culture that would drive my art.\" For the 15 years up to his 1975 Tate retrospective, Smith's life seemed charmed.

      "bodyText": "Livres, bouquets de fleurs, ordinateurs, pneus de voiture, voyages de r\u00eave, chemises sur mesure, vins rares, on trouve de tout sur Internet. Selon le cabinet d'\u00e9tudes Benchmark Group, le montant des transactions r\u00e9alis\u00e9es dans l'Hexagone par Internet s'est \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 1,3 milliards de francs en 1999. Soit trois fois plus qu'en 1998. En 2000, il devrait atteindre 2 milliards de francs. Le nombre de cyberacheteurs fran\u00e7ais (700 000) ne cesse de cro\u00eetre. Pourtant, d'apr\u00e8s un sondage Ernst &amp; Young, 22 % des internautes n'ont pas confiance dans les modes de paiement d'Internet. Cette Neteffervescence est-elle un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne ponctuel ou va-t-elle profond\u00e9ment modifier la structure \u00e9conomique des pays d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s ? C'est ce que nous avons demand\u00e9 \u00e0 trois jeunes Fran\u00e7ais, \u00e0 l'occasion de la F\u00eate de l'Internet qui s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e les 17, 18 et 19 mars. Qu'avez-vous fait pour la F\u00eate de l'Internet? Sophie, 25 ans, informaticienne: Je suis devenue une star sur Internet ! \u00c0 l'Espace Vivendi, on pouvait cr\u00e9er sa page perso en participant l'op\u00e9ration Devenez une vedette de l'Internet: apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en photo, j'ai tourn\u00e9 une mini vid\u00e9o sur le th\u00e8me : Si j'\u00e9tais une vedette, je serais.... Le r\u00e9sultat: une page perso avec ma photo, ma vid\u00e9o et un dessin humoristique. Damien, 19 ans, lyc\u00e9en: Rien de sp\u00e9cial. J'ai fait comme d'hab. Christa, 20 ans, \u00e9tudiante: Rien, mais \u00e7a aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sympa que ce soit gratuit tout le week-end ! Quelle est votre relation \u00e0 l'Internet? Sophie: Je l'utilise surtout pour communiquer par mail avec des amis \u00e0 l'international. Je surfe peu sur la Toile, sauf pour visiter de nouveaux sites qui semblent int\u00e9ressants. Damien: Je l'utilise 3 \u00e0 4 heures par jour, chez moi. Je discute sur les chats ou les IRC, de tout, de la vie de tous les jours, de ce que je fais en cours, etc. Christa: Les e-mails, les chatlines et la recherche d'informations. Tu trouves tout sur le web (la presse, les plans sorties, les voyages pas chers, etc). C'est mon passe-temps pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9. J'ai l'impression d'\u00e9tre reli\u00e9e au monde en permanence. Quelle sera l'\u00e9volution de l'Internet dans le futur? Sophie: Avec le temps, Internet va se structurer et se banaliser : tout le monde l'aura chez soi, comme le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Pour l'instant, il y a un peu tout et n'importe quoi. On peut passer des heures \u00e0 avoir rien, c'est du zapping puissance 1000 ! Pour ne pas se perdre dans la Toile, il faut vraiment savoir ce que l'on recherche. L'id\u00e9al, c'est de conna\u00eetre les adresses des sites. Damien: Aucune loi ne le r\u00e9glemente, \u00e7a va pas tarder \u00e0 d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rer ! Internet s'est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 trop vite, trop soudainement, on ne savait pas par quel bout le prendre. C'est forc\u00e9 qu'il y ait des d\u00e9rapages, comme le piratage. Le jour o\u00f9 le gouvernement instaurera des lois sur Internet, tout rentrera dans l'ordre. Christa: C'est l'avenir ! On est en plein dedans, et ce n'est que le d\u00e9but ! Il y aura de plus en plus de services, d'offres all\u00e9chantes, mais aussi de sites craignos. . . Il faut r\u00e9guler le web et interdire les sites porno, p\u00e9dophiles ou racistes. Une censure concernant ce genre de sites est n\u00e9cessaire: il faut cr\u00e9er une police internet internationale. Que pensez-vous du d\u00e9veloppement ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nal des start-up? Sophie: Cette croissance exponentielle cr\u00e9e beaucoup d'emplois, mais d'ici deux ans, le souffl\u00e9 va retomber, et on assistera au krach boursier tant redout\u00e9. Tout le monde se rue sur les start-up mais elles n'ont aucune valeur r\u00e9elle. \u00c9conomiquement, elles ne valent rien. Damien: C'est trop rapide et trop beau pour que \u00e7a dure. La plupart des start-up cot\u00e9es en bourse sont d\u00e9ficitaires. Elles ne tiendront pas le coup, et se casseront la gueule. Ceux qui les ont financ\u00e9es aussi. Christa: C'est du pipeau. Ce que veulent les entreprenautes, c'est faire du fric, sans rien produire en \u00e9change. Ce n'est pas logique qu'une bo\u00eete p\u00e8se plus de 25 millions de francs, quelques mois seulement apr\u00e8s sa cr\u00e9ation. La Net\u00e9conomie va-t-elle supplanter l'\u00e9conomie traditionnelle? Sophie: Jamais de la vie. Elles sont compl\u00e9mentaires. Les gens iront toujours dans les boutiques acheter leurs fringues pour les essayer, les toucher, voir du monde et sortir de chez eux. Damien: Non, c'est virtuel tout \u00e7a, \u00e7a ne remplacera jamais le monde r\u00e9el. Internet, c'est juste un mode de distribution suppl\u00e9mentaire, rien de plus. Christa: Les gens ach\u00e8tent peu sur le net, ils n'ont pas confiance car les paiements ne sont pas aussi bien s\u00e9curis\u00e9s qu'on veut le faire croire.

He saw a man on the stairs. Then he heard Barras shout 'he's got me' at the same time as he heard a loud bang. He then made his way towards a window. He was going towards that window when he heard a second shot and his left leg at that moment went numb. \"He then heard a third bang and felt pain in his right leg and in his panic he managed to pull the whole window out of the wall.\" Sobs from the Barras family could be heard when she added: \"At that point he heard Fred Barras say: 'He has got me. I am sorry. Please don't. Mum.' \" The jury was told that Barras followed Fearon out of the window. The teenager would have died within two minutes but it was not until the following day that his body was found. Barras was wearing rubber gloves and a chisel was found nearby. Fearon was badly injured and approached the cottage of one of Martin's neighbours who called an ambulance. \"In the meantime, Mr Martin took a pump-action shotgun to his mother's house and left it in her lavatory and that was the gun that was used in the shootings,\" said Ms Horwood-Smart. Martin claimed that he had not fired the gun before and did not know how many cartridges it held. \"He said he kept it under his bed,\" she said. \"He had gone to bed that Friday evening at around 9pm having put his two rottweilers to bed and leaving another dog, Bruno, to patrol the grounds. \"He said that he was wakened by noises. At first he thought that Bruno had got into the house. Then he saw flashes of light downstairs. He said he returned to his bedroom and retrieved the gun. \"He loaded it until it was full. He did not know how many cartridges it held. He says he returned to the landing. He negotiated the step at the top and he says that he went halfway downstairs. At that point a torch was pointed at him. He took aim and fired a shot below the light of the torch and he continued to fire until the gun was empty.\" Ms Horwood-Smart said: \"He told the officers that he had at no time warned the intruders or given them the chance to surrender. He said he thought he would hide upstairs but then thought 'I have had enough' and went downstairs with the gun.\" The case continues today.",

Uttar Pradesh 362 and 218 Hyderabad won by 92 runs Sridaran Sriram, who made his international debut for India in the now-infamous one-day series against South Africa recently, inspired Tamil Nadu to victory over Punjab in the other semi-final, at Chennai. Sriram hit a majestic 165 in TN's first innings of 461 to set up his side's seven-wicket victory; they will play Mumbai in the semis. Punjab, who trailed by 203 after beginning with 258, did better in their second innings, as Vikram Rathore made 127 and Reetinder Singh Sodhi 89. But TN were never stretched by their eventual target of 164, Sadagopan Ramesh finishing unbeaten on 77. Punjab 258 (Vikram Rathore 57) and 366 (Harbhajan Singh 5-106) Tamil Nadu 461 (Hemang Badani 70) and 167 for 3 (Sridaran Sharath 53*) Tamil Nadu won by seven wickets Zimbabwe Mashonaland romped to victory in the final of the first-class Logan Cup, thumping Manicaland by 257 runs at Harare. Their win was built around two century opening partnerships between international seamer John Rennie and recent Test cap Trevor Gripper. The pair began with a stand of 126 (Rennie 52, Gripper 86) and added 155 in the second innings (Rennie 87, Gripper 78) as Mashonaland tightened their grip. In between Bryan Strang shot Manicaland out for 123, finishing with figures of 21-12-20-7. Set 498 to win, Manicaland managed 240 as Rennie added five wickets to his runs. Mashonaland 345 (Bradley Robinson 61, Donald Campbell 50) and 275 for 5 decl. Manicaland 123 (Hamilton Masakadze 53) and 240 (Stuart Matsikenyeri 73*, Neil Ferreira 55) Mashonaland won by 257 runs Mashonaland reached the final on the back of two extraordinary matches. The first came against old rivals Matabeleland at Bulawayo, when Dirk Viljoen (173*) and Craig Evans (153 in 143 balls with five sixes) added 330 for the fourth wicket. It was a Zimbabwean first-class record for any wicket. Evans then returned figures of 6-5-5-4 to help skittle Matabeleland for 86 in the fourth innings. Mashonaland 170 (John Rennie 5-70) and 448 for 4 decl. Matabeleland 256 (Mark Vermuelen 87, Rennie 63) and 86 Mashonaland won by 276 runs In the second miracle match, Midlands, playing in the Logan Cup for the first time, totalled just 87 in their two innings to go down to a 251-run mauling at Harare. They began with 31 all out in 12.5 overs (a recovery from 6 for 5), as Mashonaland's Angus MacKay took 6-16 and Brighton Watambwa 4-15. Then, left 308 to win, Midlands reached a triumphant 56, Mackay adding 5-19, and Daniel Peacock rejoicing in figures of 2.3-0-8-4. There were 11 ducks in the two innings. Mashonaland 165 and 173 for 8 decl. Midlands 31 and 56 Mashonaland won by 251 runs Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com",

The former GLC leader, standing as an independent candidate and by far the front-runner in the capital's mayoral contest, made the claim in the New Musical Express, published today. Answering a series of readers' questions, he said: \"Every year the international financial system kills more people than world war two. But at least Hitler was mad.\" In a further comment seized on by the Tories last night as evidence that Mr Livingstone is unfit to run London, the Brent East MP suggested decriminalising ecstasy and cannabis to curb the international drugs trade. He argued that \"ecstasy is clearly not addictive, cannabis is clearly less damaging than booze\". Mr Livingstone's confirmation that he stands by past comments that the leaders of the International Monetary Fund should \"die painfully in their beds\" came amid attempts to restore his reputation with the capital's financial sector after he expressed common cause with rioters in the City of London. In an interview in the style magazine The Face in January, not long after police-protester battles at the World Trade Organisation conference in Seattle, the Brent East MP said he had \"always been in favour of direct action\", adding that he would not invite the WTO to London \"unless we can get vast stocks in so we can throw stuff at them in an organised way\". He later laughed off the remarks as media misrepresentation, but campaigners for Labour's official candidate Frank Dobson sought to capitalise on the gaffe, claiming business and city organisations had been \"very angry\". Mr Livingstone says in today's NME: \"The IMF and the World Bank are still appalling, and now the World Trade Organisation too. All over the world people die unnecessarily because of the international financial system.\" The economist Susan George has estimated that in any year since 1981 between 15-20m people have died as a result of the debt burden on developing countries. Asked by another questioner whether cannabis should be legalised \"sooner rather than later\", Mr Livingstone predicted the drug will be de criminalised, arguing that the war against drug barons had been lost and that young people recognised that, contrary to the view of the government drugs tsar, Keith Hellawell, drugs are \"not all the same\". He added: \"I do think we could consider decriminalising things like ecstasy and cannabis, but I would never do anything to encourage people to take drugs any more than I would encourage people to drink\". A spokesman for the Conservative mayoral candidate, Steven Norris, said last night: \"These comments prove that Livingstone is a hardline leftwing extremist who cannot hide his own agenda from sensible Londoners or from business. The mask always slips at the most important moment. London can ill afford the kind of danger to which Ken Livingstone is quite prepared to subject it. Londoners want safe streets and a safe transport system and not anarchy in the UK.\" Meanwhile police officers heckled Frank Dobson yesterday as he outlined his vision for policing in the capital. Mr Dobson, speaking at a specially-convened meeting into the issue of police pay, was forced to halt his speech, despite backing calls for improved pay for Metropolitan officers. The response for Mr Dobson was in contrast to Mr Livingstone, who received a warm ovation from the audience of rank-and-file officers.",

However, it can be especially difficult to explain to a child and enable them to explore their feelings; be it the death of a family member, a friend or a pet. A book can provide the ideal medium for addressing and exploring issues which are associated with bereavement. The following titles are just a few which successfully broach the subject with a degree of sensitivity and tact, without being patronising or sentimental. </p> <p><strong> It Isn't Easy</strong><br>Margaret Connolly, illustrated by Rosita Manahan (OUP, \u00a34.99)<br>Age: under 5s</p> <p>This book is for the very young and it focuses on a child whose brother has been killed in an accident. It follows him and his parents through their emotional reactions: sadness, anger and pain, and shows how they begin to come to terms with their loss.

When Ben loses his beloved dog, he really believes that he can never be happy or want another pet again. However, with time he slowly learns to find happiness in his memories and, in doing so, he also discovers that he can look to the future.

She wants to be alone, but feels isolated at the same time. Wrongly blaming herself for the deaths of two family members, she channels all her mental and physical energies into clearing a ten-mile trail which starts at her backdoor. It is a huge job, but brings her satisfaction and eventual relief from the difficult situation she has been facing. This is a beautifully told story, with some very funny moments. </p> <p><strong> Dancing Through The Shadows</strong><br>Theresa Tomlinson <br>(Red Fox \u00a33.99) <br>Age: 11+</p> <p>Just at the time when thirteen-year-old Ellen learns that her mother has breast cancer, she also becomes very involved with a dance project at her school and with her history teacher's attempts to restore an ancient well near her home. All these elements come together to create an involving story which has a strong, positive message. With Ellen, the reader is asked to face the anxieties of her mother's stressful operation, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, but also to share in the joys of performing, friendship and the tentative beginnings of a boy-girl relationship. This is a well-written story which will provide useful support for a young adolescent reader who has a parent who is seriously ill.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Jenny Blacker is mum to Ben, 5, and Harry, who is 3. And she is glad to be taking part in a project to support children in reception class. \"I want to enjoy being a mum, to be able to look back on it as a nice time. I don't want bringing up children to be a task.\" </p> <p>Blacker describes Ben as an angel in school who is often out of control at home: \"I was a nanny for eight years, and thought I'd seen it all until I had my own children. I knew I had to do something the day I smacked Ben and actually didn't care that I'd smacked him. I want to go back to being a nice mum, and when my boys grow into young men I want other people to like them.\" </p> <p>Ben is in the reception year group of Clapham Manor Primary School in London. Parents of children in his class, and from five other schools in Lambeth, were invited to take part in a project to improve children's progress through school. </p> <p>The director of Spokes - Supporting Parents on Kids Education - is Stephen Scott, a child psychiatrist at Kings College, London. \"If the children settle in well in the first year,\" he says, \"it sets them up for later on, but if they get blown off course in their first year it's hard for them to get back on.\" </p> <p>The issue of behaviour problems among primary school pupils has been causing concern at a national level. Statistics for 1995/6 show that there were 12,500 permanent exclusions from primary, secondary and special schools, an increase of 13% over the previous year. Of these, 1,400 (13%) were from primary school, an increase of more than 18% over the previous year. Research into the reasons for this indicate that the children involved had suffered several significant stresses in their lives which had combined together to affect their schooling. </p> <p>Spokes is a three-year research project, funded by a \u00a3500,000 Department of Health grant as part of a programme to discover the best way to support parents and promote the wellbeing of their child. It aims to give children a good start in school by developing their self-esteem, concentration and social skills. It also helps parents develop strategies for improving their child's behaviour and build a good relationship with their child's teacher, as well as fostering the relationship between parent and child. </p> <p>The programme is based on the work of Carolyn Webster-Stratton, professor and director of the parenting unit at the University of Washington. A copy of her book The Incredible Years 3-8 is given to each parent on the Spokes programme. </p> <p>Scott says: \"The first 12 weeks of the programme are about play, praise, rewards, setting limits and how to give clear commands when necessary. It's about turning around people's perceptions. It's a long-term investment but parents do get something back; they notice the difference.\" </p> <p>Families are videotaped at the start and interviewed by the group leaders. They meet weekly for two hours in term, at their child's school, to take part in the programme and discuss progress. Refreshments and a creche are provided. </p> <p>Over the previous week, the Clapham Manor parents set aside 10 minutes a day to play with their child. All reported how unnatural this felt, and everyone found it difficult to find 10 spare minutes. </p> <p>They were reassured, by group leader Jenny Price, that it is very common to feel strange about giving this time. Suzanne Wood, the mother of Callum, 6, and Kirstie, 5, voiced a feeling many parents will recognise when she said that if her daughter is badly behaved she feels like sending her to her room rather than giving her 10 minutes of play. </p> <p>Price agreed that it's hard to be positive and play with children when you feel cross with them. But she reassured her that the programme would give her the skills to cope. The unspoken message was that the programme would help parents feel positive about themselves and their ability to look after their children. </p> <p>The second 12 weeks of the programme helps develop children's literacy. This was devised by Carolyn Crook, research officer at the Institute of Psychiatrists, and Professor Kathy Sylva, co-director of Spokes and professor at Oxford University's Department of Education Studies. </p> <p>Pauline Mitchell, a mother of four who has completed the 2-term Spokes programme, says it \"really changed the way I approach helping them read. Now when Katherine, who is six, brings a book back home I have a quick flick through it and we have a chat about the background to the book, picking up any big words that going to come up. And now, when she's reading and gets stuck on a word, instead of me jumping in and telling her and rushing her on, I give her 10 to 15 seconds to think about it. That way I'm not taking away her confidence.\" </p> <p>The last six weeks of the programme bring the literacy and parenting skills together and look at fostering the children's problem-solving skills and increasing their independence. </p> <p>At the end of the programme the children are assessed again: families are videotaped and complete another questionnaire. \"We want to see children progressing educationally as well as increasing their ability to handle their emotions and friendships,\" says Scott. \"The purpose of the project is to see whether such programmes really work, or whether an access line would do just as well.\" </p> <p>If the project is a success, Scott hopes it will be incorporated in all schools: \"It could be led by the school's special educational needs co-ordinator with some input from an educational psychologist, and involve a volunteer parent who has completed the programme.\" </p> <p>Pauline Mitchell is sure of the project's effectiveness. \"Our house is much calmer. It has improved the behaviour of all my children. The 10-year-old has matured unbelievably and now comes in from school and gets on with his homework. </p> <p>\"The children moved schools and I have worked at developing a good relationship with their new teachers, which has helped with my eight-year-old. Instead of criticising his teacher when she tells him off, I find something good to say and ask her how we can sort out problems together. Katherine, who was in reception when I did the course, now no longer wets the bed or comes into our bed, and even the two-year-old has benefited from the literacy skills work. He recognises M for McDonald's as we walk to school!\" </p> <p>Brian Hazell, the headteacher at Clapham Manor Primary, says: \"If you have good home-school links the child benefits. You may not see immediate academic improvement but their confidence will be boosted.\" </p> <p>The school is now celebrating an excellent Ofsted report that found that it \"is built on very strong foundations of mutual respect, celebration of diversity and effective partnership between staff, home and community\". </p> <p><strong>'The trick is to ignore the bad'</strong></p> <p> Five is a strategic age to give children the skills to deal with issues that last a lifetime, believes Carolyn Webster-Stratton, of Washington University. \"This is the age they are going from creche and preschool to first year in school. It's a good time to intervene, because these kids are going to have to behave at school and get along with other kids.\" </p> <p>She uses videotape to work with parents. \"You can show a child throwing a temper tantrum and see how the parent reacts - is it in a way that makes it worse or better?\" </p> <p>Parents can practice new techniques for managing their children's behaviour. \"A child that whines and whines for a biscuit until he gets one is a child who learns to whine to get what he wants,\" she says. With practice, parents can learn to ignore the whining by seeing on videotape that it works if they do. </p> <p>\"But you have to prepare them for the fact that the whining (or whatever it is) will get worse before it gets better, because the child will escalate the whining at first to get what he wants. But, once he realises it's not working, it will stop.\" </p> <p>Webster-Stratton says some parents might not consider it good parenting to allow their child to do these things. \"The trick is to ignore the bad and give a lot of attention to the positive behaviour, so the child learns there is much more to be gained from being positive.\" </p> <p>Studies in the States have shown her parenting programmes continue to work for parents and children some years after the programme. \"I really feel the social and emotional confidence is a foundation for academic learning. If you are feeling insecure, have low self-esteem or don't have any friends, it can be hard to focus on the academic stuff. </p> <p>\"The idea is to weave these things into the curriculum so children can be doing a lot of activities which are not only teaching them numbers and reading, but tie into social skills too. </p> <p>\"There are lots of ways you can intergrate these concepts without it being an extra item on the curriculum. For instance the children could be working together on a big poster and you might not have a crayon, glue and glitter for everyone, so children are forced to negotiate for what they want and to take turns. </p> <p>\"You are meeting their needs for creativity and developing fine motor skills and also their social skills.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Oscar-winning film star Tom Hanks has been appointed by the US government to support a nationwide essay contest for Britain's teenagers, to stimulate their interest in the \"special relationship\" between the two countries and the role they played in the second world war. </p> <p>Hanks - who starred in the 1998 blockbuster Saving Private Ryan - has agreed to be a judge for the competition, which is being launched in London today by education and employment secretary David Blunkett. </p> <p>The contest is the brainchild of the American ambassador in Britain Philip Lader, who has been struck by how little British youngsters know about the US/UK wartime alliance. It was due to Steven Spielberg that awareness was raised about the devastating carnage of the D-day landing on Omaha Beach through his film, Saving Private Ryan. </p> <p>Ambassador Lader, the first serving US ambassador to have been born since the end of the war (in 1946), believes it is vital that young people take advantage of the opportunity to tap the knowledge of their grandparents and the older generation who still have stories to tell. </p> <p>\"I have two daughters at British schools,\" he told the Guardian, \"and I have become increasingly aware of how little teenagers know about British and American co-operation. It is a big chunk of their heritage.\" </p> <p> The aim of the contest, he explains, is for 14- to 16-year-olds to write an essay of up to 1,000 words on how the US-UK relationship during the war impacted on their communities. To do this they can interview their grandparents, other members of the older generation or use original research material. For example, mixed marriages have had an enormous effect on people's families, and the American communities that sprang up around airbases in areas such as Norfolk are still alive and well. </p> <p>He also hopes the competition - which has prizes for teachers, too - will revitalise teachers' own interest in this element of history within the curriculum. </p> <p>The contest will be launched at the Imperial War Museum in London, which chronicles the relationship between the two countries through its unique wartime archives. David Blunkett, accompanied by Pamela Smith, the US Minister-Counselor for Public Affairs, will be there in an original Red Cross jeep used during the war. </p> <p>It is estimated that there are around 600,000 potential young people who will be invited to enter. </p> <p>Accompanied by a parent or teacher, the three main winners will be invited to Washington where they will attend meetings at the White House and Congress. It's not clear at this stage whether president Clinton will be present! American Airlines and Marriott Hotels will provide transport and accommodation. Twelve further winners and their nominating teachers will each win a personal computer provided by Gateway Computers. </p> <p>Ambassador Lader has lined up an impressive judging team which, as well as Hanks, includes Stephen Ambrose, an eminent historian and biographer of presidents Eisenhower and Nixon; the US secretary of state for education Dick Reilly; the ex-Republican presidential candidate Robert Dole; and the Supreme Court judge Sandra Day-O'Connnor. On the British side, the judges will include the best-selling author Ken Follett. </p> <p>This is a great opportunity to learn more about history and build trans-generational relationships at the same time - as well as winning some great prizes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Oscar-winning film star Tom Hanks has been appointed by the US government to support a nationwide essay contest for Britain's teenagers, to stimulate their interest in the \"special relationship\" between the two countries and the role they played in the second world war. Hanks - who starred in the 1998 blockbuster Saving Private Ryan - has agreed to be a judge for the competition, which is being launched in London today by education and employment secretary David Blunkett. The contest is the brainchild of the American ambassador in Britain Philip Lader, who has been struck by how little British youngsters know about the US/UK wartime alliance. It was due to Steven Spielberg that awareness was raised about the devastating carnage of the D-day landing on Omaha Beach through his film, Saving Private Ryan. Ambassador Lader, the first serving US ambassador to have been born since the end of the war (in 1946), believes it is vital that young people take advantage of the opportunity to tap the knowledge of their grandparents and the older generation who still have stories to tell. \"I have two daughters at British schools,\" he told the Guardian, \"and I have become increasingly aware of how little teenagers know about British and American co-operation. It is a big chunk of their heritage.\" The aim of the contest, he explains, is for 14- to 16-year-olds to write an essay of up to 1,000 words on how the US-UK relationship during the war impacted on their communities. To do this they can interview their grandparents, other members of the older generation or use original research material. For example, mixed marriages have had an enormous effect on people's families, and the American communities that sprang up around airbases in areas such as Norfolk are still alive and well. He also hopes the competition - which has prizes for teachers, too - will revitalise teachers' own interest in this element of history within the curriculum. The contest will be launched at the Imperial War Museum in London, which chronicles the relationship between the two countries through its unique wartime archives. David Blunkett, accompanied by Pamela Smith, the US Minister-Counselor for Public Affairs, will be there in an original Red Cross jeep used during the war. It is estimated that there are around 600,000 potential young people who will be invited to enter. Accompanied by a parent or teacher, the three main winners will be invited to Washington where they will attend meetings at the White House and Congress. It's not clear at this stage whether president Clinton will be present! American Airlines and Marriott Hotels will provide transport and accommodation. Twelve further winners and their nominating teachers will each win a personal computer provided by Gateway Computers. Ambassador Lader has lined up an impressive judging team which, as well as Hanks, includes Stephen Ambrose, an eminent historian and biographer of presidents Eisenhower and Nixon; the US secretary of state for education Dick Reilly; the ex-Republican presidential candidate Robert Dole; and the Supreme Court judge Sandra Day-O'Connnor. On the British side, the judges will include the best-selling author Ken Follett. This is a great opportunity to learn more about history and build trans-generational relationships at the same time - as well as winning some great prizes.",

As a dance artist and one of the first holders of a creative and performing arts fellowship she is part of a national experiment trying to overturn that idea. </p> <p>Her research at Nottingham Trent University will result not only in a traditional paper in an academic journal and perhaps a CD Rom but also in performances that she has choreographed. The idea that a performance - dance, music, drama - can be researched has met with considerable distrust among academics and would probably baffle most of the public. But since it was set up two years ago, the Arts and Humanities Research Board has nailed its colours to the mast by including creative arts in its \u00a350m research programme, and setting up a fellowship scheme for the purpose. </p> <p>With the board poised to become a fully fledged research council the argument will become more public. Lycouris, a senior lecturer in contemporary arts, admits it is a problematic area. But she argues that not only does a lot of intellectual effort go into producing dance, as with other arts, but that they generate knowledge, even if it is from an ephemeral performance. </p> <p>\"In any art form where you create anything you have to make decisions about how to use your materials. You have to be aware of what is going on around you and how these things come together in society. </p> <p>\"The experience of an audience as they watch a performance is knowledge. The experience of a live performance can be very intense. It is a 'floating' notion of knowledge that circulates in a different way from papers you find in libraries,\" she said. </p> <p>For Paul Langford, the research board's chief executive who is due to stand down in September, there is no doubt the decision to give as much weight to the creative arts as to the traditional scholarship of the humanities has been the right one in principle. </p> <p>It also allows the research board to make a case for funding activities with huge economic impact on UK plc (not to mention Cool Britannia). The creative industries, as the Department of Culture, Media and Sport points out, generate jobs. So research into design or dance begins to look a good deal less airy fairy. </p> <p>Certainly there was no open challenge to the idea of creative arts research at a recent seminar mounted by the board. As one speaker noted, the proportion of employment in the creative industries would go on rising. Not only would more people be involved in producing all forms of arts and music but more would be spent on consumption. That suggested a need to study audiences and how they interacted with the arts. </p> <p>There was, however, some confusion about the boundaries between research and creative work. Concerns were raised about the future for lone scholars in the light of the board's encouragement of teamwork and collaboration. (In two years' time the ring fence between arts and humanities is to be removed - a \"bold move\", predicted one speaker, which would prove a \"cold bath\" for some in the traditional humanities.) </p> <p>Because the research board has 12,000 research active staff in the arts and humanities - one in four of all UK university researchers - to support, it has very few funds to distribute compared with the science research councils or even with social science, but its arrival has raised the status of work in their fields, it was felt. </p> <p>The board has penalised 12 departments (including one at Oxford) for poor submission rates by PhD students, but should it attempt to steer this research effort? </p> <p>The issue split the seminar. On one side it was argued the field was so broad that the board was already making choices and these ought to be spelled out. \"The board should be honest enough to say it has some priorities,\" urged one vice-chancellor. </p> <p>Another felt identifying themes would be disastrous. \"Most of the good ideas will come from people finishing their PhDs. Our job is to bring home the money for the young people to do their stuff. We have got to let them play the key role in deciding what the stuff is.\" </p> <p>But pointing to the lack of research in pre-colonial history as an example of a neglected minority area, one participant felt the board needed to take a strategic approach and give academics a \"delicate nudge\" in the direction of where the \"silences\" were. </p> <p>With the prospect of European, as well as British government, money dangled in front of the arts and humanities, the mood of the seminar was optimistic. But would the safest funding pipeline lie through the Department of Culture, Media and Sport - sympathetic but less powerful in Whitehall - or with the other research councils under the Department of Trade and Industry? </p> <p>No decisions have yet been made but the majority mood was summed up in the comment: \"There are friends and there are funders and we have got to follow the money.\"</p>",

It was especially valuable for the boys to see the project through, from beginning to end - and to end finally with a clean floor!\" \u0095 The Building Experiences Trust can be contacted on 01453 756575.",

This is one of the fundamental questions that a special investigation team will have to answer about the character of a troubled tertiary college in south-west Essex. </p> <p>A week ago the Further Education Funding Council took the unprecedented step of sending the team into Basildon College after the college received the third worst college inspection report since the council's inception. </p> <p>The investigation was also prompted by fears about the college's deteriorating financial health and by the receipt of more than 50 complaints about management leadership style which, it is alleged, created a culture of fear. </p> <p>Chris Chapman, the college's principal since September 1997, has been suspended by the governors while the investigation takes place and John Gould, director of marketing and business development, has been made acting principal. </p> <p>The October 1999 inspection report gave the college eight (out of 10) grade 4s (the second lowest grading classification) for curricula and cross college provision. Management, governance, quality assurance and support arrangements for students were all judged to be unsatisfactory. </p> <p>Maths and science, business and professional studies, health and childcare and English and access to higher education were also judged to be unsatisfactory. </p> <p>David Melville, the funding council's chief executive, said: \"This is the third worst inspection report ever and represents a decline in standards of teaching since the college's previous inspection. The governors and managers of Basildon College have only recently begun to address the real problems of low levels of retention and achievement with support from the Standards Fund.\" </p> <p>Staff, who say they are too frightened to be named, allege that there is a culture of blame, fear, retribution and intimidation in the college and that employees are subject to bullying and harassment. One lecturer talks of \"general intimidation of staff through extremely effective bullying tactics\", unmanageable workloads, impossible deadlines and repeated threats of disciplinary action against staff. </p> <p>\"People are afraid,\" she said, \"because they know there will be reprisals and retributions. If anything goes wrong it will always be the responsibility of the academic managers or the academic staff.\" </p> <p>After indications that the college inspection in October had not gone well, some 20 employees were threatened with disciplinary procedures. Only one case went to a hearing, the other charges were later all dropped. </p> <p>\"People feel that this is no longer a safe working environment. It can be quite terrifying. I think people feel all the time that they need to keep their backs covered, the amount of emotional energy and physical labour that goes into covering one's back is quite phenomenal. </p> <p>\"I think it's astonishing that some people are able even to go in the classroom and string a sentence together quite honestly, because some of what they have had to put up with has been horrendous - systematic bullying, being sought out, and undermined, ridiculed, named and shamed, you name it and they have got a way of doing it.\" </p> <p>Another lecturer said: \"The atmosphere is dire at the moment. There is a lot of scaremongering going on, people are very frightened, but they are also very angry and very desperate. </p> <p>\"We are being treated as if we are worth nothing. Our professionalism is constantly undermined. For some people it's hell on earth coming into work every day. We are in a people organisation, and the people in charge of us don't know how to behave.\" </p> <p>A third member of staff added that apart from the bullying there is the stress caused by working in an organisation with inconsistent and untimely decision and policy making. </p> <p>Natfhe, the lecturers' union, is also in dispute with the college over a proposal to use unqualified teaching staff, and 45 proposed staff redundancies. </p> <p>Mr Chapman was unavailable for comment. John Gould, the acting principal, said that he was not aware of there being a culture of fear in the college. Until last week, he added, no members of staff had sought to use the college's grievance procedure. </p> <p>Eight grievance procedures, however, have just been initiated. </p> <p>Part of the reason, he added, for the poor inspection report was that the college has had a noncompliance culture where some members of staff chose not to do things, for example, pastoral care, that most lecturers would regard as a normal part of their jobs. </p> <p> Mr Gould added that while he was not aware of a culture of bullying, a new management team was trying to manage successfully and drive up standards. In 1996, 40% of the college's students completed their courses and passed their exams. By 1998/9 this rate had risen to 76%. </p> <p>\"Clearly that improvement was not by accident,\" he said. \"That was a managed situation.\" It was unfortunate that the college received a poor inspection report in October, he added. At that time the college lacked a complete year's worth of data which would have proved that the quality of student achievement had risen dramatically. </p> <p>Mr Gould added that Chris Chapman was brought in as principal in September 1997 with a clear mandate to improve quality. \"To improve quality, clearly, the situation had to be managed and he (Chapman) brought in a new management team, of which I was one, with a very clear focus on retention and achievement, and it has paid off.\" </p> <p>\"Now you don't make omelettes without breaking eggs,\" Mr Gould added. </p> <p>\"What we have got here is a situation where the college had to be managed to ensure the quality did rise and some people did not like that. </p> <p>\"Now whether it will be construed as bullying, if there are cases of what I would call real bullying, I am not aware.

This was a report of interviews I did with three first-year black students at Cape Town University.

But despite these measures and an orientation course for new students, life for the black student from remote rural areas was still immensely difficult. </p> <p>The backgrounds of my three interviewees were completely different. The one I admired and respected the most was Agnes, 30, a mature student with a 14-year-old child. Coming from Colesberg in the Northern Cape, she left school pregnant at 15 and supported herself and her son with jobs in hotels and restaurants.

The difficulties of attending lectures and studying during the day, while working five nights a week in a bar to pay for it all, seemed overwhelming. I doubted that she would manage to stay the course. </p> <p>Last year I revisited Cape Town and was delighted to find that Agnes was still at the university. My article was repeated in the Guardian Weekly, and I was very surprised to receive a letter from a retired Afrikaner who was living in France. He wrote: \"I hail from the same town as Agnes - Colesberg. I most probably knew her family. My father used to be the main employer in the town. I would like to send her a contribution which might help her to complete her studies. Please send me her address - and her family name!\" </p> <p>This proved to be fairly difficult, but eventually I discovered that she was Agnes Vuyiswa Mcinziba and was living in Bergvliet. </p> <p>Some months later, I heard from our benefactor in France, enclosing a copy of a letter he had received from Agnes. He now had a friend for life. She was ecstatic. She thanked him and asked a mass of questions. \"I have never had a letter from anybody overseas. How is life where you live; I mean, what sort of people live there, is it kind of like what Colesberg used to be?... Do you have anybody that you speak Afrikaans to?...\" </p> <p>Since then, I have heard several times from my Afrikaner friend. Born in Colesberg in 1929, he studied botany and spent eight years working in the Herbarium at Kew Gardens. He then retired to a small village in a remote corner of France. What a strange and circular route that led him to help a student from the Northern Cape. </p> <p>Two months ago, I was back in Cape Town and met up with Agnes. The last year had been particularly difficult. Her dad \"had got retrenched\", and she had been sick in hospital twice. The money from France had been crucial in helping her complete her degree. </p> <p>Agnes was looking wonderful and was much more confident and self-assured than when I first met her. She was working as a part-time cashier for Ratanga Junction Park - a sort of Disney Fun Park - while on the lookout for a permanent job. </p> <p>Although employment prospects in South Africa are very difficult, I have great confidence in Agnes' future.

Luckily. This time, unlike the great famine of 1984/5 when up to a million people died, the alarm has sounded early and the world has a chance to prevent a disaster turning into a catastrophe provided donor governments quickly improve their act.</p> <p>Ethiopia's farmers are more dependent on rain than those of almost any other country in Africa. They live in areas which are unbelievably remote with most of them more than a day's walk from the nearest dirt road, so that aid is very hard to distribute. Fifteen years ago tens of thousands died unseen, and those still able to walk barely managed to trek to rural towns and \"feeding centres\" before they too succumbed.</p> <p>At that time, too, a war was going on across much of the famine-affected areas, making it even harder for food aid to reach people. Ethiopia was ruled by a dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, who took a long time to admit there was a problem. When he did, he exploited it to cram famine refugees from the rebel region of Tigray into aircraft and buses by force and dump them hundreds of miles from their homes.</p> <p>Yet even within this harsh context, as I and other journalists were able to report at the time, the United Nations aid agencies and foreign charities achieved a great deal. The image, still occasionally trotted out by armchair critics, that the west kowtowed to the government in Addis Ababa and refused to mention the war was wrong. Around 70% of the aid was delivered independently of the government and direct to the starving. Western governments constantly criticised the use of force in the resettlement programme and refused to support it. Thanks to Michael Priestley, who took over as the UN's special representative in Ethiopia in October 1985, they eventually managed to get it stopped. When Mengistu refused to let food reach the starving through the lines of war, charities and governments found ways to deliver it \"round the back\" by going to rebel areas direct. No relief operation is perfect and there was overlap, lack of coordination, and delay, but in 1985 the aid may have saved as many as seven million lives.</p> <p>This time the ground is more favourable. A low-level hit-and-run guerrilla war plus dangerous banditry is having an effect in the pastoral areas of the Ogaden, where scores of people are already dying. This has made it hard for agencies to assess needs or get lorries of aid past marauders. The main war is hundreds of miles away in the highlands but even there, where potentially eight million people are at risk, the region is nothing like as war-ravaged as in 1985.</p> <p>Ethiopia's conflict with Eritrea is confined to the border strip. The fact that the highlands' closest port, Assab, is part of Eritrea now is not a major obstacle since Djibouti's docks have been improved. The country has more lorries than before, and fewer have been taken over by the army to move men and material as the war currently is static. There has been no fighting for two months. The war's worst effect is that 350,000 displaced people are living in overcrowded villages which do not have the resources to feed newcomers, let alone themselves.</p> <p>A second change from 1985 is that the new government, which overthrew Mengistu in 1991, set up a system of emergency grain stocks to cover the threat of famine. This meant, for example, that when the current three-year drought began in 1998 it was able to draw on well-positioned reserves to feed people until international aid arrived. The problem it now faces is that the European Union has been woefully slow in replenishing the stocks even though the Ethiopian government warned of impending problems in December last year, and again early this year. Britain is one of four European countries which provides grain in addition to the EU's contribution and Clare Short's Department for International Development insists it replenished the stocks that were drawn down last year. But the EU's total is much greater in size and Britain shares a measure of blame, along with other EU governments, in not having pressed the commission in Brussels to act sooner and faster.</p> <p>Famines are complex things since parts of Ethiopia produce a grain surplus. This is not a countrywide disaster. The Ethiopian government is buying around 100,000 tonnes of grain from local traders but, market forces being what they are even in famine conditions, it has asked the EU and western charities not to submit tenders at the moment for fear of the price being driven up. What Europe must do is speed up its promised deliveries of foreign-grown grain in the next two months before the threat of famine becomes real.</p> <p>Governments also need to look to the long term. One of Ethiopia's difficulties since 1985 is that its population has doubled. Rural overcrowding and a lack of urban jobs mean that more and more families are getting poorer daily. With foreign help the Ethiopian government has been constructing small earth dams to catch the country's limited rainwater, building rural roads, and setting up local credit schemes. Sadly, larger-scale projects are not moving forward partly because foreign governments, including Britain's, have been cutting back on development aid because of the war with Eritrea. Ethiopia has been thrown out of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries' debt reduction scheme for the same reason. Last year this poorest of countries paid \u00a360m in debt service.</p> <p>Herein lies the cruellest of the current ironies. While thousands of ordinary citizens in the west give generously to help the hunger-ravaged children of the Ogaden, our governments and banks take millions back in interest. War is relevant, but the government in Addis Ababa has justice on its side when it says it did not start it, and has tried hard to negotiate its end. That does not mean its record is entirely clear. When the war broke out, it brutally expelled thousands of Eritrean civilians living in Ethiopia, many of them for decades. But it cannot be described as the aggressor in the current war, nor are its tactics as brutal as those of the Mengistu regime.</p> <p>So Britain and other foreign countries need to be more flexible. The distinction between emergency and development aid for countries at war - \"we give the one, but not the other\" - is often too facile. So too is the policy of \"no long-term help until you make peace\". Otherwise we may scrape by in averting real famine this time, but not prevent a new one coming along again.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto: jonathan.steele@theguardian.com\">jonathan.steele@theguardian.com </a></p>",

When the war broke out, it brutally expelled thousands of Eritrean civilians living in Ethiopia, many of them for decades. But it cannot be described as the aggressor in the current war, nor are its tactics as brutal as those of the Mengistu regime. So Britain and other foreign countries need to be more flexible. The distinction between emergency and development aid for countries at war - \"we give the one, but not the other\" - is often too facile. So too is the policy of \"no long-term help until you make peace\". Otherwise we may scrape by in averting real famine this time, but not prevent a new one coming along again. jonathan.steele@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "A furious Clare Short last night lashed out at critics of the government's disaster relief programme, accusing the media of \"distorting\" Britain's record on aid spending. The international development secretary was responding to accusations over the weekend that Britain is planning to cut back its help to Ethiopia just as famine tightens its grip on the country. The story was \"absolutely and completely factually wrong\", she said. Speaking to the Guardian, Ms Short said Britain's relief programme for the victims of the famine was entirely unaffected by the decision to cut back long-term assistance to Ethiopia over concerns that money was being diverted to fuel the country's long-running war with its northern neighbour, Eritrea. She said Britain's humanitarian assistance programme for Ethiopia was funded from a separate budget and was untouched by the decision to cut the UK's annual spending on development projects in the country from \u00a339m to \u00a313m. \"I do not believe anyone in the UK believes we should be providing long-term assistance to a country which is increasing its spending on arms, year on year,\" she said. \"They [the media] want to pretend people are going hungry in Ethiopia because we are not providing aid. Our food is there and will continue to be.\" Ms Short is clearly angered by the hammering her department has received over its recent performance in global disaster zones. Britain was accused of doing too little too late during the floods in Mozambique and Honduras, while the UK's efforts to help the victims of the volcanic eruption on Montserrat were marred by the furore over her comments that the inhabitants were demanding \"golden elephants\" from their former colonial power. Reports at the weekend also claimed that Britain is cutting its aid budget to Mozambique despite the need to rebuild the country after last month's devastating floods. In fact, the figures show that Britain spent \u00a357m in the country this year - nearly \u00a330m more than it planned to, and that the annual aid budget has increased steadily from less than \u00a320m three years ago. Ms Short said Britain was recognised by international bodies as among the fastest and most effective deliverers of emergency aid. \"We have a world-renowned and widely admired ability to deliver speedy humanitarian operations,\" she added. The international development secretary was speaking in the Tanzanian capital, Dar es Salaam, on a joint trip with three fellow European development ministers to coordinate their work. Britain spends more on development assistance in Tanzania than in any other country except India and Ms Short regards the country as a model of what can be achieved when both donors and local governments focus aid on reducing poverty. Since Labour came to power, foreign aid spending has been targeted at helping countries which are committed to economic reform and achieving the internationally agreed development targets, by putting money into primary health care and education, rather than military spending. Ms Short has not been afraid to tell countries that she will not countenance them wasting British taxpayers' money on guns and tanks. While her plain-speaking style wins her few friends in Westminster, she is admired for her conviction by developing countries, even by those who disagree with her views. \"She puts her money where her mouth is,\" one World Bank official said yesterday, adding that she had brought a \"a sense of urgency\" to achieving longstanding goals for reducing poverty which had been gathering dust. Ms Short has also succeeded in mustering more money for Britain's development budget, which was slashed by successive Tory governments.

Parliamentary elections loom and land has become a political weapon in a myriad of ways: redistribution is a means of buying votes from landless peasants; farmworkers' votes will prove decisive in deciding whether the ruling Zanu-PF party is humiliated at the polls next month; and racial confrontation is a convenient distraction from the imploding economy.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe accuses Zimbabwe's whites of more than just trying to cling to the land. He says they are trying to reassert political power by providing the cash and organisation for the fledgling opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). It is, he alleges, an unholy alliance between white business and black trade unions led by the MDC's chief, Morgan Tsvangirai.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe is not wrong.</p> <p>For the first time since independence, whites are sticking their heads above the political parapet. When Mr Mugabe came to power in 1980, he viewed whites as a defeated people. Under Zimbabwe's new constitution they could remain citizens and keep their property and lifestyle. But they were implicitly expected to keep out of the business of governance and not to criticise publicly.</p> <p>That is the way it stayed for 20 years. But now influential whites among the 70,000 who remain argue that the weeks and months ahead could decide whether they even have a future in Zimbabwe, and that they cannot remain bystanders.</p> <p>Many have swung their support behind the MDC in the belief that if Mr Mugabe's government is not reigned in, Zimbabwe's economy will collapse and with it will go their businesses.</p> <p>\"Monty\" Montgomery heads the MDC's campaign in the Hurungwe and Kariba regions where he is responsible for three constituencies crucial to the opposition. His family's lineage in Zimbabwe goes back to the 1890s. His parents were teachers in Bulawayo at the junior school once attended by HF Verwoerd, the architect of South Africa's apartheid.</p> <p>Mr Montgomery, 49, came of age during Ian Smith's rule. Two days after leaving school he was conscripted into the police. By the time majority rule loomed, he was an officer in the notorious special branch responsible for the interrogation of political prisoners and \"terrorists\".</p> <p>These days, Mr Montgomery runs an agricultural supply business fallen on hard times. \"I am not a party political person but the economic state of the country and business is so bad I had to get involved,\" he said. \"If democracy doesn't return, the economy will collapse. There's a fuel crisis. We're looking at currency devaluation. The last 10 years were the worst, particularly corruption. It is being allowed to kill the economy.\"</p> <p>White support is proving crucial to the opposition. The party will not say how much money it has raised, or from where. But the head of its campaign in Mashonaland West's 10 constituencies, Duke du Coudray, concedes that a significant proportion of campaign funds comes from white-owned businesses.</p> <p>\"It is not that black businesses don't support us, it is just much more difficult for them to get involved. Zanu-PF has forced representatives onto the boards of almost every big company and corporation and they make sure no donations come to us. They make threats, warning that the 'people' will protest and there could be attacks,\" he said.</p> <p>When 5,000 black MDC delegates elected the party's executive in January, three out of the top four were whites.</p> <p>\"There's only one reason we whites are so visible,\" said Mr du Coudray. \"The mass of this party is black but the black bourgeoisie is afraid to take a public stand. They are intimidated away from public support. They are pushing us to the fore, saying we support you but we can't do it in public.\"</p> <p><b> Conspiracy</b><br></p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai, the MDC leader, publicly welcomed white support at a rally on Sunday. \"We are going to take whites because they are creating jobs. The whites are our cousins in this country and we are not betraying people by being in alliance with them,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe sees it as a conspiracy in which blacks are a front for unreconstructed Rhodesians. He was delighted at Ian Smith's efforts to use the political crisis to make a comeback but Mr du Coudray says the former Rhodesian prime minister's posturing gave whites a chance to show they had changed.</p> <p>\"Ian Smith did us a favour because he gave white people of this country a choice. They could back him or back Morgan Tsvangirai and they went with Tsvangirai. This is not about reviving white political power,\" he said.</p> <p>For the moment, the primary battleground remains the farms, where the invasions are not only about grabbing land but also votes. Each of the 1,000 or so occupied farms is home to about 800 workers and dependants who are potential voters. They account for nearly one-fifth of the electorate, and will cast the deciding ballots in many constituencies.</p> <p>The government does not want them to slip beyond its grasp. On some farms, the squatters have insisted that the labourers join them. On others, workers have been ordered to attend political meetings. But it all has the same purpose: making sure the farmworkers' votes go to Zanu-PF.</p> <p>\"We've been targeted because we employ a large section of the voters,\" said Mr Hinde. \"No doubt there's a racial element as well but they want to make some of our labourers vote for the party. So we've become a prime target, both politically because they have made land an issue and because they want the labour to vote for them.\"</p> <p>For some whites, the upheaval has proved too much. The final straw for John Guimbeau was a note from the 250 or so squatters on his tobacco farm demanding to strip the roof off his house for their shacks.

If you continue doing that we will bring five lorries of war vets tomorrow or any day. You are not the only farmer who has his farm taken. For your information we have taken Van Tonder's today and he was very cooperate,\" he wrote. The note warned a white Zimbabwean farmer, Richard Bedford, to stop resisting the occupation of his sprawling tobacco farm by hundreds of poor blacks who now claim the land as their own. Their leader, Comrade Musuaka, arranged for a few dozen men to pound out revolutionary songs while demonstrating what their machetes could do to a tree. Richard Bedford gave in. Gunpoint At a neighbouring farm, Derek Hinde has spent three weeks answering distress calls on the radio. When they come - some panic-stricken at the mob at the gates, some resigned - he cannot help reflecting that there was a time when Zimbabwe was Rhodesia and all he had to do was shoot the enemy. Now he has to negotiate. \"Confronted by guys trying to take your farm away, you lose your head. Some of our guys want to kill them. I can understand it but where will it get them? When you've got a guy standing two feet away shouting 'Down with white people,' it's hard to negotiate but we do,\" he said. Mr Hinde's vast tobacco and rose plantation is one of about 20 farms that have been invaded in the Wedza district, an hour's drive south-east of Harare. On the face of it, Zimbabwe's burgeoning political crisis is a tussle over land between the descendants of British settlers, who stole it at gunpoint, and those of the black Zimbabweans robbed of their birthright. But almost everyone involved knows that is not the real issue. Parliamentary elections loom and land has become a political weapon in a myriad of ways: redistribution is a means of buying votes from landless peasants; farmworkers' votes will prove decisive in deciding whether the ruling Zanu-PF party is humiliated at the polls next month; and racial confrontation is a convenient distraction from the imploding economy.

Downing Street billed it as a diplomatic coup that Mr Putin should make Britain his first port of call. Tony Blair and the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, have been working hard to establish a rapport with Mr Putin, a former KGB career officer. But the visit will be controversial. The Council of Europe, of which Britain is a member, has begun a process of suspending Russia because of its involvement in Chechnya. The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, who sits on a joint cabinet committee with Mr Blair, said there should be no question of a visit until Mr Putin's words about respect for human rights were matched by deeds in Chechnya.

The 24-hour visit - arriving in London on Sunday evening and leaving the following evening - followed an invitation from Mr Blair when he met Mr Putin in St Petersburg last month, a fortnight before Mr Putin's sweeping victory in presidential elections. The St Petersburg trip left the prime minister open to charges that he was taking sides in Russian politics and also strongly suggested that Mr Putin's brutal prosecution of the war in Chechnya would be no bar to developing closer relations with the West.

      "bodyText": "Government attempts to play down the significance of a north-south divide were in disarray last night when a new report pointed to growing regional inequalities in Britain caused by a booming southern economy. A survey backed by the government's own economic and social research council painted a gloomy picture of Labour's recession-hit heartlands. Its author accused the Deparment of Trade and Industry of concealing regional disparities \"for political reasons\". But ministers pointed to the redrawing of the map of areas which qualify for government industrial aid as evidence that they are intent on reviving flagging regional economies. The map, published yesterday under presssure from Brussels, reduces the number of so-called asisted areas. But some northern areas gain at the expense of the south. The report, from Cardiff University's centre for advanced studies, found that while London and the south east were performing as well as the world's top 10 competitive countries, places like Yorkshire and the Humber, the north east and Wales ranked alongside Malaysia, Hungary, Chile and Portugal. It \"conclusively highlighted the continuance of a north-south divide\" and warned of a widening gap unless attempts are made to encourage new home-grown businesses and entrepreneurs in the regions. The report strongly challenges a Cabinet Office report, recently commissioned by Tony Blair, which maintained that disparities within regions were often wider than any north-south divide. On a visit to Wales last week - ranked second bottom in Cardiff University's regional competitiveness table - the prime minister said he would not fall into the \"Tory trap\" of making a \"false distinction\" between Labour's heartlands and middle Britain. This followed an attack on dissident backbenchers, notably the former defence minister and Liverpool Walton MP Peter Kilfolyle, at Labour's local government conference. Mr Blair laid into Labour critics who \"peddled the myth\" that the south was entirely prosperous while the north was overwhelmingly poor. \"It's not true and it is a false illusion that the answer to the problems of the north are somehow to punish the south,\" he said. However, the Cardiff report's author, Dr Robert Huggins, warns of bleak prospects for many areas away from the south - apart from northern \"hot spots\" such as oil-rich Aberdeen and the booming Scottish capital of Edinburgh - because there is little likelihood of companies in the south moving north. He said: \"Although the Department of Trade and Industry has carried out certain research on competitiveness in the UK, for political reasons it has been reluctant to measure the actual comparative performances of regions.\" Dr Huggins said the Cardiff analysis identified those parts of the UK \"that are becoming so economically uncompetitive that the end result is widespread deprivation and misery for the people who live there\". His report uses a new index measuring wealth - or gross domestic product per head - along with average earnings, unemployment, and the new \"knowledge based\" industries so beloved by the government. While the south east, London, the south west and East Anglia - all home to high-tech clusters, or booming financial service industries - perform above the average, the midlands, the north west and north east, Yorkshire and the Humber, Scotland and Wales significantly under-perform. Ministers were stung by the findings. Some dismissed them as over-simplified by failing to recognise measures to encourage science parks in the midlands and north. \"We can't turn things round overnight,\" one said. Alan Beith, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: \"The south is not all success and the north is not all unsuccessful - but overall the north is in serious need of help. Britian's economy is seriously unbalanced and the evidence might be that divisions are getting wider.\"",

      "bodyText": "Jack Straw is facing mounting pressure to step up the national dispersal programme for asylum seekers after conceding for the first time last night that at least one local authority could handle no more refugees because of weight of numbers. Asylum seekers landing in Britain from next Monday will be barred from living in Kent and will be compulsorily bussed around the country, the home secretary said last night. Mr Straw bowed to pressure from local authority leaders and declared that Kent had taken \"more than its share\" of asylum seekers. He faces pressure from a further 20 local authority areas, including the Isle of Wight, the New Forest and Northampton, to declare that they too are \"full up\". The measures will apply to all new asylum seekers whether they lodge their claim on the day they arrive \"at port\" or later \"in-country\". At the same time, Mr Straw said that 9,000 decisions on asylum cases had been taken in March, again outstripping applications, which was evidence that the asylum system was recovering from its breakdown over the past year. Figures released to MPs yesterday revealed the pressure facing the immigration service and the councils tasked with housing those seeking asylum. According to the junior Home Office minister Lord Bassam of Brighton at least 74,490 individuals or families applied for asylum in the year to the end of February, compared with 49,395 in the same period last year. The figures showed last September as a peak month, with 7,355 applications, and December with 7,180. Totals for January and February 2000 are estimated at 6,110. The decision to declare part of south-east England a \"no- go\" area for refugees came as William Hague and Ann Widdecombe brushed aside government pleas for calmer language and pressed ahead with their charge that Labour had made Britain \"a soft touch for a massive influx of bogus asylum seekers\". Mr Hague claimed at a fund-raising dinner last night that \"genuine asylum refugees are suffering most at the hands of a system on the verge of collapse\". What looked like a concerted attempt to push the issue up the political agenda in advance of next month's local elections came only hours after Downing Street had appealed to both sides to moderate their language rather than \"play the race card\". It came as the Liberal Democrats were reporting both their main rivals to the commission for racial equality, although last night the party's home affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, praised government efforts to \"cool the heat and lower the temperature\". The political row continued as Southwark council, in south London - which includes Mr Hughes' North Southwark and Bermondsey constituency - prepared to bus 50 families of asylum seekers, more than 150 people, to Glasgow. Some of those being moved had been settled for months in the London borough while they waited for a decision on their case. During Commons question time, at which Mr Straw denied Tory allegations that Labour had created current levels of asylum applications, Miss Widdecombe launched a vehement attack on the government's record since 1997. \"The message went out to the rest of the world that Britain is a soft touch for asylum seekers,\" the shadow home secretary said. \"You sent the message, it's your responsibility.\" Tony Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, used the word \"bogus\" at least once yesterday, but avoided directly accusing the Tories of playing the race card - as the immigration minister, Barbara Roche, and Trevor Phillips, Labour's No 2 in London, have done. Instead he told reporters: \"The prime minister would never, ever allow the Labour party - to use that unpleasant, unfortunate phrase: to play the race card in relation to asylum seekers.\"",

Both were traumatised by the war, and both have been embattled, in some sense, ever since. But while South Korea has found a relatively secure place in the world, thanks to American and Japanese support and to its own economic success, North Korea has never escaped from the sense of vulnerability captured by Meray.</p> <p>Both states have feared one another - and one another's allies - but it is arguable that the North has been more fearful than the South.</p> <p>The summit planned for June between Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-il represents an easing of these Northern anxieties precisely because it is a step away from the unification, which both sides theoretically proclaim as an aim, rather than a step towards it.</p> <p>Despite the fact that some of the politicians involved bear titles which include the word \"reunification\", and in spite of the rhetoric on both sides, good relations between the Koreas depend on postponing unification to the distant future. This has been the difficult lesson of the 90s.</p> <p>The uninformed expectation that North Korea would be more or less peacefully folded into the south in the manner that East Germany joined West Germany - or that it would collapse and be taken over - caused an increase in tension that could have led to war, particularly in 1994. It probably also pushed on the North Korean nuclear weapons and missile efforts which were the main cause of the military tension.</p> <p>After 1989 the idea that Korea would be unified on the German model was examined. The South Koreans were unenthusiastic only because findings suggested that incorporating the North would be hugely expensive. North Korea's leaders, by contrast, were enraged that people around the world were happily discussing the extinction of their regime.</p> <p>The renunciation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in 1993 was a signal that their powerful sense of encirclement had become intense. The rest of the decade has been spent persuading the North Koreans that the US, South Korea, Japan, and their many allies, far from wishing North Korea dead and gone, are ready to help it survive and even prosper.</p> <p>The former US president Jimmy Carter helped defuse the crisis of 1994 by creating the basis for an agreement to freeze North Korean civil nuclear development.</p> <p>US efforts to reassure North Korea have continued, most recently with talks based on the recommendations of the former defence secretary William Perry. These led to a lifting of American sanctions and to a deal last year under which North Korea is to suspend missile development and conduct no more long range missile tests like the one in 1998..</p> <p>The food crisis in North Korea, which began in 1995 and remains serious, brought into that closed society hundreds of foreign aid workers. A degree of trust has gradually been established. Kim Dae-jung, the former dissident who became president of South Korea in 1998, has pursued what he calls a \"sunshine policy\" which stresses helping North Korea.</p> <p>The results of this emphasis on help by the United States, international agencies and South Korea have paid off this year in diplomatic contacts and negotiations with Japan, the Philippines, Italy, Australia and now between the two Koreas.</p> <p>Kim Jong-il and the North Korean leadership actively sought this help because it was the only way their state could cope, but they remain suspicious of the deeper motives of those aiding them. But while swings between between trust and suspicion will continue to shape Korean relations, it is permissible to hope that the worst may be over.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Recalling his days as a correspondent on the Northern side during the Korean war, the Hungarian writer Tibor Meray spoke about travelling through a landscape so devastated by US bombing that cities had become no more than collections of chimneys. \"I don't know why houses collapsed and chimneys did not,\" he told Thames television, \"but I went through a city of 200,000 inhabitants and I saw thousands of chimneys and that - that was all.\" Without some such image it is difficult to understand the Koreas. Both were traumatised by the war, and both have been embattled, in some sense, ever since. But while South Korea has found a relatively secure place in the world, thanks to American and Japanese support and to its own economic success, North Korea has never escaped from the sense of vulnerability captured by Meray. Both states have feared one another - and one another's allies - but it is arguable that the North has been more fearful than the South. The summit planned for June between Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-il represents an easing of these Northern anxieties precisely because it is a step away from the unification, which both sides theoretically proclaim as an aim, rather than a step towards it. Despite the fact that some of the politicians involved bear titles which include the word \"reunification\", and in spite of the rhetoric on both sides, good relations between the Koreas depend on postponing unification to the distant future. This has been the difficult lesson of the 90s. The uninformed expectation that North Korea would be more or less peacefully folded into the south in the manner that East Germany joined West Germany - or that it would collapse and be taken over - caused an increase in tension that could have led to war, particularly in 1994. It probably also pushed on the North Korean nuclear weapons and missile efforts which were the main cause of the military tension. After 1989 the idea that Korea would be unified on the German model was examined. The South Koreans were unenthusiastic only because findings suggested that incorporating the North would be hugely expensive. North Korea's leaders, by contrast, were enraged that people around the world were happily discussing the extinction of their regime. The renunciation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in 1993 was a signal that their powerful sense of encirclement had become intense. The rest of the decade has been spent persuading the North Koreans that the US, South Korea, Japan, and their many allies, far from wishing North Korea dead and gone, are ready to help it survive and even prosper. The former US president Jimmy Carter helped defuse the crisis of 1994 by creating the basis for an agreement to freeze North Korean civil nuclear development. US efforts to reassure North Korea have continued, most recently with talks based on the recommendations of the former defence secretary William Perry. These led to a lifting of American sanctions and to a deal last year under which North Korea is to suspend missile development and conduct no more long range missile tests like the one in 1998.. The food crisis in North Korea, which began in 1995 and remains serious, brought into that closed society hundreds of foreign aid workers. A degree of trust has gradually been established. Kim Dae-jung, the former dissident who became president of South Korea in 1998, has pursued what he calls a \"sunshine policy\" which stresses helping North Korea. The results of this emphasis on help by the United States, international agencies and South Korea have paid off this year in diplomatic contacts and negotiations with Japan, the Philippines, Italy, Australia and now between the two Koreas. Kim Jong-il and the North Korean leadership actively sought this help because it was the only way their state could cope, but they remain suspicious of the deeper motives of those aiding them. But while swings between between trust and suspicion will continue to shape Korean relations, it is permissible to hope that the worst may be over.",

I am chair of governors of a school for children with learning difficulties which has just passed its second inspection with flying colours. Outstanding teachers that this school and the education system as a whole can ill afford to lose are quite determined to move, probably via early retirement, rather than go through the experience another time. I know of several highly regarded headteachers who have led their schools successfully through one Ofsted and are adamant that they will never go through another one.</p> <p>Perhaps, if the whole process were genuinely improving standards in the long term, the stress inflicted on teachers could be justified, but it is not. Its main effect is to drive many of the most effective, as judged by Ofsted itself, classroom teachers and heads out of the profession prematurely, denying children the benefit of their expertise and limiting the opportunity to pass their skills on to a new generation of teachers. <br><b> Name and address supplied</b></p> <p>\u0095 I wonder what the inspectors are feeling who gave Miss Relf and her school a bad report? Teachers get enough stimulation and stress from standing in front of 30 children all day. It has been obvious from its inception that Ofsted could do nothing but harm by adding to this pressure. <br><b> Steve Lupton</b><br> Manchester<br> shlpictures@eggconnect.net</p> <p>\u0095 The public humiliation of teachers and schools who, as judged by a fallible Ofsted, fail to reach their targets of achievement, is a nasty bullying business. The approach which the government selects to improving achievement in schools should provide a model of respectful relationships for children and young people. It is to be hoped that the loss of this teacher's life will provoke a public debate about the inspection of schools which will lead the government to switch from a punitive to a supportive method for encouraging their development. One teacher's death is enough. <br><b>Tony Booth</b><br>Cambridge</p>",

I am chair of governors of a school for children with learning difficulties which has just passed its second inspection with flying colours. Outstanding teachers that this school and the education system as a whole can ill afford to lose are quite determined to move, probably via early retirement, rather than go through the experience another time. I know of several highly regarded headteachers who have led their schools successfully through one Ofsted and are adamant that they will never go through another one. Perhaps, if the whole process were genuinely improving standards in the long term, the stress inflicted on teachers could be justified, but it is not. Its main effect is to drive many of the most effective, as judged by Ofsted itself, classroom teachers and heads out of the profession prematurely, denying children the benefit of their expertise and limiting the opportunity to pass their skills on to a new generation of teachers. Name and address supplied \u0095 I wonder what the inspectors are feeling who gave Miss Relf and her school a bad report? Teachers get enough stimulation and stress from standing in front of 30 children all day. It has been obvious from its inception that Ofsted could do nothing but harm by adding to this pressure. Steve Lupton Manchester shlpictures@eggconnect.net \u0095 The public humiliation of teachers and schools who, as judged by a fallible Ofsted, fail to reach their targets of achievement, is a nasty bullying business. The approach which the government selects to improving achievement in schools should provide a model of respectful relationships for children and young people. It is to be hoped that the loss of this teacher's life will provoke a public debate about the inspection of schools which will lead the government to switch from a punitive to a supportive method for encouraging their development. One teacher's death is enough. Tony Booth Cambridge",

It's clear there's been a fundamental change in what we want from our holidays. The lone woman traveller has no intention of languishing in Benidorm, so Thomson and their like would do well to sit up and take note. After all, she's where the profits are.",

      "bodyText": "A supermarket manager refused his job back after being diagnosed with HIV yesterday won an estimated \u00a3300,000 compensation, the highest sum awarded under disability discrimination laws. Mark Hedley, 34, reached the settlement with German-owned Aldi ahead of an employment tribunal hearing in Newcastle upon Tyne. The cut-price grocery chain is believed to have paid up to avoid damaging publicity after claiming staff had refused to work with the gay manager and warning his illness might put customers off. The award is by far the largest in an HIV employment case. His lawyer called for loopholes in anti-discrimination legislation to be closed and gay rights campaigners said it sent a clear signal to employers that prejudice would prove expensive. Mr Hedley, who lives in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, said: \"I'm glad it's over and my life can move on. \"I'll take my mother on holiday to Florida because it's been a strain for her and I'm looking for another job.\" A confidentiality agreement prevented both sides from discussing the size of the settlement. Mr Hedley had won plaudits from superiors but was barred in February last year from returning to his \u00a334,000 job running Aldi's store in Seaham, Co. Durham. He had been diagnosed HIV positive in November, 1998, and felt fit to go back after treatment. Yet he was advised by the company to leave and sent on gardening leave. Mr Hedley sued Aldi, alleging disability and sex discrimination, after the firm made disputed claims that staff did not want to work with him and profits would suffer. About 20,000 people in Britain have been diagnosed with HIV, four fifths of them men. Aldi's evidence submitted before the scheduled tribunal hearing said: \"The decision to ask the applicant to remain away from work was justified in all the circumstances of the case given the nature of the applicant's condition, the fact that other staff in the same store said they would be uncomfortable with working with the applicant and the respondent's genuine and understandable concern that if the applicant remained in situ sales at the store would suffer.\" Mr Hedley's solicitor, Stefan Cross, of the employment specialists Thompsons, called for the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act to be tightened to protect all employees from \"prejudice and stigma\" triggered by a diagnosis. \"This case raised significant legal issues, particularly related to the protection of people with progressive conditions - not only HIV.\" The previous highest award under the act was \u00a3167,000 secured 18 months ago by a British Sugar worker with bad eyesight who was made redundant. An agreed statement from Mr Hedley and Aldi was released yesterday. It said: \"After constructive discussions between the parties, terms have been agreed between Aldi and Mr Hedley in respect of those allegations and it has been agreed that his employment with Aldi will end by mutual consent. \"The parties have agreed to keep the detail of their agreement confidential.\"",

The five-month-old was injured in an incident on Sunday on the platform at Manors station. He is believed to have been with his father at the time. Police made four arrests yesterday after appealing for information about a gang of youths allegedly at the station shortly before an emergency call at 4.20pm to police and ambulance crews. Appeals for information were broadcast all day on the Metro and commuters were turned away from Manors, which was locked with police on guard. The baby is in intensive care at Newcastle general hospital, with detectives waiting for the results of medical tests to get a clearer picture of the cause of his injuries. Northumbria police said: \"The baby, who is not being identified, was with an adult in the station. \"For reasons which have yet to be fully established he has suffered head injuries believed to have taken place on the platform. Exactly what happened in the Metro station is still being investigated.\" Police have interviewed the child's parents and are examining security camera videos which cover the rapid-transit Metro system on Tyneside.

The protesters claim around 250 shareholders have already sold their shares following the letters, while the company's share price has dipped from around 20p to 13.5p as a result of publicity surrounding the campaign. Mr Braybrook is alleged to hold almost 20,000 shares in the company, worth around \u00a32,700. Yesterday he said he had no objections to a peaceful demonstration outside his home but was concerned that extremists might become involved. \"They have their freedom of rights and I believe I do too,\" he said. \"They want me to sell my shares so they can bring the company down, but I don't want to do that at the moment. I feel I have the freedom to buy and sell shares. \"I'm concerned there might be extremists out there. We know what's happened at Huntingdon Life Sciences, where demonstrators have followed workers home, and I think that is an infringement of people's private rights.\" The campaigners defended their right to protest outside Mr Braybrook's home, claiming the action was intended to prick his and other people's conscience about the ethical implications in investing in companies involved in animal testing. Andrew Gay, marketing director at Huntingdon Life Sciences, said: \"It is outrageous that these people can be threatened in their own home. We have had phone calls from shareholders, particularly elderly people, who say they feel threatened. \"The people who are selling are selling at a loss but the big institutions are going to make money.\" The activists used shareholder lists available at Companies House which detail names and addresses. The letter, sent out by a faction called the Group With No Name, was accompanied by a \"factsheet\" listing campaigners' allegations against the company. A spokesman for the group said: \"Every shareholder has been sent literature explaining what goes on at Huntingdon. Many were disgusted and have sold up. \"Those who have not have made a conscious decision to invest in cruelty, and we will make sure they are named and shamed in their communities.\"",

A judge yesterday threw out charges, including wounding, assault and perverting the course of justice, against three officers, ruling that the men could not get a fair trial because \"unjustifiable delays\" meant that key witnesses could no longer be traced. A series of other allegations about police behaviour in the city, which partly accounted for the CPS workload, have failed to reach court, although 15 officers have attended internal disciplinary hearings. The police complaints authority is also considering taking action against a number of staff at Derby's Full Street station. The collapse of the case is particularly embarrassing for the CPS, because the police inquiry was considered so serious and sensitive that it was supervised by the police complaints authority. Judge Peter Baker QC told Sheffield crown court that the police inquiry itself had been \"detailed and careful\", involving 298 statements and 640 other documents. The CPS said yesterday that its procedures had been changed as a result of the debacle, and that speedier reviews of such high profile cases \"should now be ensured\". Publicly sensitive cases would in future be allocated by senior management to individual CPS lawyers, rather than being passed around colleagues. The officers who walked free were involved in three complaints of alleged assault three years ago and subsequent claims of a cover up. Sgt Louis Martin, 32, was accused of attacking Naweed Akram in the back of a police car and then lying about the incident. PC Ian Parker, 40, was also accused of lying about Mr Akram and of using a spray weapon on another Derby man, James Fitzsimons. Sgt David Simmonds, 36, was accused of assaulting a third man, Paul Gilbert, with a baton. The case was halted after a defence submission that proceeding with the trial would be an abuse of legal process.

The workload at the CPS meant that the complicated issues were passed from office to office within the service, resulting in months of delay. The CPS said later: \"We are conscious of the comments made by the judge. \"These cases resulted from a much wider police inquiry which necessarily required review both by CPS lawyers and independent counsel.

The slump in dairy farming and supermarket pricing have forced the closure of the creamery at Port Charlotte on the Hebridean island that produces the distinctive mild cheese. More than 800 milking cows are being shipped to the mainland for slaughter or sale, and all that remains of the brand is eight or nine months worth of maturing rounds. Receivers called in two weeks ago have been unable to find a prospective buyer. \"What's happened to us is symptomatic of the decline of the dairy industry,\" said the creamery manager, Jack Phillips, yesterday. For the island's 3,000-strong community, the creamery's closure has been a body blow. It was taken over as a limited company with eight farmers as shareholders four years ago. \"It's not just the eight jobs directly involved,\" said Mr Phillips. \"There will be no tanker driver needed for the milk, possibly one less mechanic at the garage; one of the farmers has laid off four dairy workers with young families, that's maybe less kids going to the rural school. There may be about 30 jobs that go in all. And 30 jobs in a population of 3,000 puts it on a par with Rover.\"",

Amid signs that boys are coping less well than girls with peer pressure and are more likely to turn to crime as well as drugs and alcohol, teenagers begged for the chance of an \"alternative buzz\" offered by activities such as bungee jumping, go-karting or stock car racing. The study, the government's largest consultation with young people, identified a generation of 5m teenagers struggling under increasing pressure to conform to idealised images in advertising and the media. While girls were more likely to use close friendships to help manage stress, boys turned their anger outwards in aggressive or criminal behaviour, the survey of 500 teenagers in England found. Where boys were unable to cope, they were three times more likely than girls to commit suicide, while girls were up to four times more likely to harm themselves deliberately, or fall victim to eating disorders including anorexia and bulimia. Boys and young men interviewed for the study made a plea for more opportunities to take part in dangerous activities in \"safe settings\". \"They want activities that give them a buzz but take place in a controlled environment, such as bungee jumping,\" said a Home Office source.

And, afterwards, the dexterity with which Emma dressed, put up her hair and removed the major part of the forest floor from her underwear so that the village noticed nothing but her attractively heightened colour. </p> <p>It was the sort of scene Mrs Patrick Campbell had in mind when she deplored people doing it in public and frightening the horses. </p> <p>Spiced with explicit sex, Madame Bovary (BBC 2) will have given her compatriot, Monsignor Renard (ITV) a bloody nose. In the concluding part tonight she is, appropriately enough, in competition with Bad Girls (ITV) and When Celebrities Strip (ITV). The effectiveness of implicit sex could be seen in a minimal gesture by Emma's husband (Hugh Bonneville), who, as her lover sang lieder, wiped a wisp of milk from her mouth with his thumb and then sucked it. </p> <p>Madame Bovary thought life should be like a novel. She did not realise, naturally, that she was in a novel. Unusually for a romantic heroine, her story starts after marriage. </p> <p>It is a pretty production, though sunk at first in buried-alive shadows. This is certainly deliberate as, when Emma (Frances O'Connor) meets Rodolphe, (Greg Wise) there are, quite literally, fireworks. </p> <p>The backing cast - Barbara Jefford, Eileen Atkins, Trevor Peacock, Joe McGann, Keith Barron - is the best butter but rather wasted. (Though, even with a live turkey under his arm, Trevor Peacock makes his presence felt). </p> <p>I do believe I might have liked it more if the BBC's publicity material had not begun \"The heavens have been torn open.\" </p> <p> The Lost Ark Of The Covenant (Channel 4) is a Mecca , if I may put it that way, for the gently demented. The last theorist, as I remember, believed it contained radioactive material. Mike Sanders, described a little disturbingly as a self-taught biblical scholar, constructed a toppling tower of conjecture to show that the ark was seized by Ramses the Third.

      "bodyText": "One can only admire the expertise and expedition with which Rodolphe removed Emma's riding habit, her top hat with six feet of blue veiling, laced stays, bloomers, camisole, chemise, stockings and, with a wrench like velcro, her stout riding boots. And, afterwards, the dexterity with which Emma dressed, put up her hair and removed the major part of the forest floor from her underwear so that the village noticed nothing but her attractively heightened colour. It was the sort of scene Mrs Patrick Campbell had in mind when she deplored people doing it in public and frightening the horses. Spiced with explicit sex, Madame Bovary (BBC 2) will have given her compatriot, Monsignor Renard (ITV) a bloody nose. In the concluding part tonight she is, appropriately enough, in competition with Bad Girls (ITV) and When Celebrities Strip (ITV). The effectiveness of implicit sex could be seen in a minimal gesture by Emma's husband (Hugh Bonneville), who, as her lover sang lieder, wiped a wisp of milk from her mouth with his thumb and then sucked it. Madame Bovary thought life should be like a novel. She did not realise, naturally, that she was in a novel. Unusually for a romantic heroine, her story starts after marriage. It is a pretty production, though sunk at first in buried-alive shadows. This is certainly deliberate as, when Emma (Frances O'Connor) meets Rodolphe, (Greg Wise) there are, quite literally, fireworks. The backing cast - Barbara Jefford, Eileen Atkins, Trevor Peacock, Joe McGann, Keith Barron - is the best butter but rather wasted. (Though, even with a live turkey under his arm, Trevor Peacock makes his presence felt). I do believe I might have liked it more if the BBC's publicity material had not begun \"The heavens have been torn open.\" The Lost Ark Of The Covenant (Channel 4) is a Mecca , if I may put it that way, for the gently demented. The last theorist, as I remember, believed it contained radioactive material. Mike Sanders, described a little disturbingly as a self-taught biblical scholar, constructed a toppling tower of conjecture to show that the ark was seized by Ramses the Third. Ramses, it was fascinating to see, was in very good shape for a mummy. As a burglar fears creaking stairs, I am uneasy about a programme where every second sentence squeaks \"Stunning... awe some... amazing... startling\". Mike's methods are intuitive (\"It doesn't take much of a stretch of the imagination to see...\") and can be illustrated by his method of finding Djahi, where Ramses may have built a temple. \"I asked my wife to go to The Times Atlas Of The World, look into the index and see if there was any Djahi anywhere.

      "body": "<p>Though he was perhaps too unfocused a creative and public personality to make a major impact, Peter Jones, who has died aged 79, was an intelligent, inventive, versatile and witty part of British show business for more than 50 years.</p> <p>As actor, playwright, script- writer and gameshow personality he had solid virtues, but his versatility may have told against him, and his range was certainly wider than it was deep. He is likely to be best remembered as the fumbling dress manufacturer Harold Fenner, who wages ineffective war against shop steward Miriam Karlin in The Rag Trade, the BBC-TV series which began in 1961, was revived in 1977 and, at its peak, commanded nearly 15m viewers.</p> <p>Jones tended to specialise in characters that PG Wodehouse would have called, if not disgruntled, at least not particularly gruntled. His lowly and usually skint executive, Gerald Garvey, in that other popular television series, Beggar Thy Neighbour, which began in 1967, was a masterpiece of jittery jealousy of his better-off - if working-class - neighbour, played by Reg Varney.</p> <p>But though television consolidated his fame, it was radio that first brought Jones to prominence - and kept him there. To hear him on the long-running BBC game- show Just A Minute, in which contestants had to talk for 60 seconds without repetition, hesitation or deviation, was a bubbling joy. He was also the programme's champion interrupter at challenging other contestants, especially Kenneth Williams, with whom he virtually did a double act of personality opposites.</p> <p>Earlier, Jones had featured in the BBC radio comedy show, In All Directions, which he co-wrote with Peter Ustinov. The Ustinov connection was seminal. Jones appeared with him on stage in Eric Linklater's Love In Albania and in Crime And Punishment, and their friendship resulted in them chatting together, apparently spontaneously, with a tape recorder running, often taking off on verbal flights of fancy. The result became In All Directions, which took over from the Goon Show of the 1950s in cult status.</p> <p>Born at Wem, Shropshire, the son of an antiques dealer, Jones went to Wem grammar school and Ellesmere College, later referring moodily to his \"tenth-rate public school\" education. A rather delicate boy (to quote his own estimation of himself at that age), he nevertheless produced and acted in school plays.</p> <p>He had seen only two professionally performed plays, but landed a job as an actor at the age of 16, at the Grand, Wolverhampton. There were two performances a night of The Composite Men, in which Jones was supposed to play a reporter. After his first performance, he found a note dispensing with his services and suggesting that he spent some of his resultant spare time watching actors who knew what they were doing.</p> <p>Years later, he would drily call himself the actor with the shortest run on record. He consoled himself by landing a part in a BBC radio production of Arnold Bennett's The Card, broadcast from Birmingham, in which knowing where to put his feet and hands was not so crucial.</p> <p>But he got other jobs in rep, or in summer shows on the east coast, and in 1942 gave his first West End performance, also as a reporter, in a revival of George Bernard Shaw's The Doctor's Dilemma at the Haymarket. Jones was especially congenial to Shaw. His strong, clear but unaffected voice admirably fitted the playwright's belief that his lines were so foolproof that all the actors had to do was say them intelligently and the back rows could hear. Jones went on to appear in Shaw's The Simpleton Of The Unexpected Isles and Misalliance.</p> <p>By 1946 he was in Crime And Punishment at the Globe, and during the run, the actress Hermione Baddeley took an option on a play he had written called Marion. By then, Jones was working on another play and had written several scripts for BBC radio.</p> <p>He made a respectable reputation as an actor in intelligent plays, often in classics like The Imaginary Invalid and The Rivals but, as a playwright, he did not enjoy much success. In 1952, he appeared in his own play, Sweet Madness, at the Vaudeville, and in 1966 he appeared in, and directed, his work, Angie and Ernie, at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford. Neither became part of the popular repertory.</p> <p>Jones would admit that no one could call him a playwright of consequence, and he often felt that he fell between two or more stools. In the 1960s, he said of his career: \"It seems to have been a series of disasters. No one quite knows precisely what to do with me . . . I appear in comedies, but do not rate the title of comedian; when I go on the stage, I still feel like someone from the audience helping out the conjuror.\"</p> <p>His television successes and his reputation as a radio wit were to alter all that, helped by occasional films, like School For Scoundrels (1960), Carry On Doctor (1968) and The Return Of The Pink Panther (1974), in which his well-practised suggestion of crumbling and irate semi-competence was good for many laughs.</p> <p>To help unravel the mysteries of Douglas Adams's surreal epic, The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, Jones supplied reassuring explanations of the bizarre on radio in the 1970s, and in the 1981 television production. His tone of detached authority as \"the Book\" brought him much voiceover work. The radio anecdotes that he wrote and related as the spoof theatrical all-rounder \"Jacko\" Kingston Platt were permeated with his ironic view of his own career.</p> <p>Jones's wife, the American actress Jeri Sauvinet, died last year; he is survived by their two sons and daughter.</p> <p>Peter Jones, actor and writer, born June 12 1920; died April 10 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Though he was perhaps too unfocused a creative and public personality to make a major impact, Peter Jones, who has died aged 79, was an intelligent, inventive, versatile and witty part of British show business for more than 50 years. As actor, playwright, script- writer and gameshow personality he had solid virtues, but his versatility may have told against him, and his range was certainly wider than it was deep. He is likely to be best remembered as the fumbling dress manufacturer Harold Fenner, who wages ineffective war against shop steward Miriam Karlin in The Rag Trade, the BBC-TV series which began in 1961, was revived in 1977 and, at its peak, commanded nearly 15m viewers. Jones tended to specialise in characters that PG Wodehouse would have called, if not disgruntled, at least not particularly gruntled. His lowly and usually skint executive, Gerald Garvey, in that other popular television series, Beggar Thy Neighbour, which began in 1967, was a masterpiece of jittery jealousy of his better-off - if working-class - neighbour, played by Reg Varney. But though television consolidated his fame, it was radio that first brought Jones to prominence - and kept him there. To hear him on the long-running BBC game- show Just A Minute, in which contestants had to talk for 60 seconds without repetition, hesitation or deviation, was a bubbling joy. He was also the programme's champion interrupter at challenging other contestants, especially Kenneth Williams, with whom he virtually did a double act of personality opposites. Earlier, Jones had featured in the BBC radio comedy show, In All Directions, which he co-wrote with Peter Ustinov. The Ustinov connection was seminal. Jones appeared with him on stage in Eric Linklater's Love In Albania and in Crime And Punishment, and their friendship resulted in them chatting together, apparently spontaneously, with a tape recorder running, often taking off on verbal flights of fancy. The result became In All Directions, which took over from the Goon Show of the 1950s in cult status. Born at Wem, Shropshire, the son of an antiques dealer, Jones went to Wem grammar school and Ellesmere College, later referring moodily to his \"tenth-rate public school\" education. A rather delicate boy (to quote his own estimation of himself at that age), he nevertheless produced and acted in school plays. He had seen only two professionally performed plays, but landed a job as an actor at the age of 16, at the Grand, Wolverhampton. There were two performances a night of The Composite Men, in which Jones was supposed to play a reporter. After his first performance, he found a note dispensing with his services and suggesting that he spent some of his resultant spare time watching actors who knew what they were doing. Years later, he would drily call himself the actor with the shortest run on record. He consoled himself by landing a part in a BBC radio production of Arnold Bennett's The Card, broadcast from Birmingham, in which knowing where to put his feet and hands was not so crucial. But he got other jobs in rep, or in summer shows on the east coast, and in 1942 gave his first West End performance, also as a reporter, in a revival of George Bernard Shaw's The Doctor's Dilemma at the Haymarket. Jones was especially congenial to Shaw. His strong, clear but unaffected voice admirably fitted the playwright's belief that his lines were so foolproof that all the actors had to do was say them intelligently and the back rows could hear. Jones went on to appear in Shaw's The Simpleton Of The Unexpected Isles and Misalliance. By 1946 he was in Crime And Punishment at the Globe, and during the run, the actress Hermione Baddeley took an option on a play he had written called Marion. By then, Jones was working on another play and had written several scripts for BBC radio. He made a respectable reputation as an actor in intelligent plays, often in classics like The Imaginary Invalid and The Rivals but, as a playwright, he did not enjoy much success. In 1952, he appeared in his own play, Sweet Madness, at the Vaudeville, and in 1966 he appeared in, and directed, his work, Angie and Ernie, at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford. Neither became part of the popular repertory. Jones would admit that no one could call him a playwright of consequence, and he often felt that he fell between two or more stools. In the 1960s, he said of his career: \"It seems to have been a series of disasters. No one quite knows precisely what to do with me . . . I appear in comedies, but do not rate the title of comedian; when I go on the stage, I still feel like someone from the audience helping out the conjuror.\" His television successes and his reputation as a radio wit were to alter all that, helped by occasional films, like School For Scoundrels (1960), Carry On Doctor (1968) and The Return Of The Pink Panther (1974), in which his well-practised suggestion of crumbling and irate semi-competence was good for many laughs. To help unravel the mysteries of Douglas Adams's surreal epic, The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, Jones supplied reassuring explanations of the bizarre on radio in the 1970s, and in the 1981 television production. His tone of detached authority as \"the Book\" brought him much voiceover work. The radio anecdotes that he wrote and related as the spoof theatrical all-rounder \"Jacko\" Kingston Platt were permeated with his ironic view of his own career. Jones's wife, the American actress Jeri Sauvinet, died last year; he is survived by their two sons and daughter. Peter Jones, actor and writer, born June 12 1920; died April 10 2000",

Many of the protesters who disrupted the Seattle meeting of the World Trade Organisation last December are gathering in Washington to protest over the role of the bank and its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in the globalisation of the world economy. Large-scale protests - billed as \"Seattle East\" - are being planned for April 16 and 17 to mark the spring meetings of the two organisations. The bank funds development projects, while the IMF helps countries facing financial crises. The demonstrators outside the bank building said that its projects harm the environment. \"The World Bank is funding oil mining and gas drilling and continues funding projects which increase our dependence on fossil fuels and increasingly destroys indigenous land,\" said Jillian Frumkin of Ozone Action, which staged the protest in partnership with Friends of the Earth. \"We want them to reform.\" \"The World Bank's drilling and mining projects have left a trail of environmental damage, increased poverty and severe social disruption in poor countries,\" said Brent Blackwelder, the head of Friends of the Earth in the US. \"The record shows these projects help no one but powerful multinational corporations.\" The list of demands was signed by 200 groups from 41 countries. With memories of the destruction in Seattle still fresh, Washington's police chief, Charles Ramsey, said his officers were ready to deal with problems. \"The demonstrators will determine how we react to this but one thing's for certain, we're not going to allow property damage and fires and those kinds of things, because obviously that's just simply unacceptable,\" he said. \"However, they have the right to peacefully protest and that they will be allowed to do. \"Our job is to see to it that this thing goes off smoothly, their job is to attempt to do whatever they can do to disrupt it. It's not personal, we just all have different roles here,\" he added.",

Results from 13 out of 145 municipalites showed big gains for the multi-ethnic Social Democratic Party, but Serb and Croat voters have stayed loyal to the nationalist parties which led them into war. The results suggest that the Muslim community, particularly in larger towns such as Sarajevo, has been the first to turn its back on nationalists. The result will give a impetus to the holding of a general election in Bosnia in October. Western authorities in Bosnia welcomed the result. The US ambassador, Thomas Miller, called it 'the beginning of a new era'. But that enthusiasm may be dampened by the victory of the Serbian Democratic Party, which was founded by the indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic, in large parts of the Serbian Republic in Bosnia, and by the Croatian Democratic Union in Croatian areas of the federation. The hope of the international community will be that, in the general election, Serbs and Croats will follow the Muslims' lead and choose more moderate parties which came second and third in many areas. They hope that when Serbs and Croats see that the Muslims have rejected their own Party of Democratic Action, they will feel encouraged to choose social democratic and liberal parties in the regions of Bosnia where their communities are dominant. The big vote for the Serbian Democratic Party was probably helped by the arrest last week of one of its wartime leaders, Momcilo Krajisnik, by Nato soldiers acting for the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague. The nationalist wins may yet be tempered by the counting of the votes of 300,000 refugees and 800,000 internally displaced people, who were entitled to vote for candidates in the communities from which they were expelled during the war. The final results may take weeks.

Her party's rank and file had demanded a radical break with the scandal-tainted era of Helmut Kohl, and yesterday they got it. Though not Eurosceptic as such - it did not question German membership of the EU - Ms Merkel's vision of a much looser union with more devolved powers, was light years away from the one foreseen by Mr Kohl. In a much more rightwing speech than had been ex pected, Ms Merkel linked her cause to the profoundly German concept of the Heimat -beloved native town or village. \"Either we succeed in creating a Europe of the people or we shall have to put up with a centralised and over-bureaucratic entity,\" she said, using language which would not have been out of place at a Tory conference. The first woman and the first easterner to head a major German party, Ms Merkel was later voted into office unopposed, with 95% of the ballot. Struggling to reunite a movement reeling from the recent funding scandal, Ms Merkel made repeated conciliatory gestures to the right. Most strikingly, she attacked the EU for its isolation of Austria where J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Freedom party is a partner in government. Her criticism was that the EU had only succeeded in promoting Mr Haider's cause, from which she disassociated her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).

But she went on to deploy views not heard from a CDU leader since at least the 1950s. \"Centralisation is the same as egalitarianism and egalitarianism means standstill,\" warned Ms Merkel, who rose to prominence as a dissident in East Germany. In a passage reminiscent of John Major's lyrical evocation of spinsters on bicycles, Ms Merkel sketched her vision. Heimat was not \"experiencing the community as an anonymous machine that distributes money but as a place where one is needed and where one can decide and take responsibility\", she said. Because Germany had strong regional characteristics, \"it is only logical that we say no to centralism and over-regulation whether it comes from Brussels or Berlin, but that we say yes to a Europe of the regions and of the diversity of its citizens\", she added. Ms Merkel, 45, floated to the leadership on a tide of popular support after her predecessor, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble stepped down.

At present all children born to Emirati parents become UAE citizens, but new proposals will limit this right to children whose fathers are UAE nationals. The legislation would make it almost impossible for an Emirati woman divorcing a foreigner to win custody of her children because they could be technically stateless. Child custody is a thorny issue in Islamic societies, where sharia law generally grants custody of children old enough to be weaned to the father in the event of divorce. Studies indicate that divorce rates have risen sharply in the last decade in all Gulf states; around a quarter of marriages end in divorce in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, rising to 29% in Kuwait and 40% in the UAE. Officials in several states, including the UAE, have blamed marriages to foreigners for rising divorce rates. This month senior officials in Abu Dhabi unveiled plans to introduce mandatory medical tests for Emirati brides whose husbands-to-be had applied to the government-run Marriage Fund for financial assistance. Marriage Fund grants will be available only once the woman has been tested, but the ministry of justice, Islamic affairs and endowments said it would ban marriages where the woman tested positive for certain unspecified diseases. The UAE's ruler, Sheikh Zayed, created the \u00a342m marriage fund in 1992 to combat the soaring dowry prices blamed for rising numbers of marriages to foreigners. The fund offers money to men marrying local women. It has threatened fines of up to \u00a380,000 on families whose weddings defy the new austerity and has ordered parents to limit dowries to \u00a36,000. Officials are promoting mass weddings - common in poor Shi'a villages in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province - to cut costs. Meanwhile, teachers and youth workers report that teenage Emirati girls are increasingly reluctant to marry, finding their male compatriots conservative and saying that foreign Arab men make more considerate husbands. \"It amazes me how cynical my female students are about marriage,\" said a teacher in Dubai. \"They would rather never marry than marry a man who expects them to lead the same kind of life as their mothers. \"They often say that they want to marry a non-national.

Seven people have pleaded guilty to connected offences. </p> <p>Investigations into similar rackets are continuing under the auspices of the revenue's special compliance office in Nottingham. </p> <p>Simon Rogers, aged 41, of Stevenage, bolstered his list of genuine clients with thousands of phantom building workers and made false claims for tax rebates on behalf of both the real and fictional tax payers. Rogers, who had denied the offences, was convicted at Blackfriars Crown Court, central London, after a 10-week trial. The revenue expects him to be sent to prison. </p> <p>The seven self-employed building workers who admitted revenue offences were either clients or associates of Rogers. They are Neil Scott, of Letchworth, John Mitchell of London, Michael James and John McGinnity, both of Stevenage, Anthony Whaymand , of Baldock, Colin Chantler of Huntingdon and Robert Knights, of Watford. </p> <p>Sentencing of all those convicted will take place on May 2. An eighth man was found not guilty and a ninth died before coming to trial. </p> <p>Rogers misused revenue forms supplied to the construction industry allowing those who have overpaid tax to claim it back. His Stevenage-based practice boasted 4,600 clients, which if true, the revenue noted, would make it \"the largest of its kind in the home counties\". </p> <p>In reality, a large chunk of the client list was fictional, and one headache for revenue investigators has been sifting real from invented clients. </p> <p>Anonymous death threats were made to two witnesses in the case, according to the revenue, to prevent them from testifying. Although Rogers's practice has been closed down, the revenue believes similar tax fraud is being carried out elsewhere in the east Midlands and northern home counties and a major inquiry is continuing. Information supplied to the investigation, the revenue said, will be treated in strict confidence. </p> <p>The Rogers case highlights an intensified crackdown on tax offences by the revenue. In December, it emerged that convictions for tax fraud are running at about double the level of a year earlier. Halfway through the financial year, the number of people convicted of serious fiscal offences was about the same as for the whole of 1998/99. </p> <p>Most prosecutions arise from \"aggravating features\" such as false invoicing or lying to revenue officers.</p>",

The seven self-employed building workers who admitted revenue offences were either clients or associates of Rogers. They are Neil Scott, of Letchworth, John Mitchell of London, Michael James and John McGinnity, both of Stevenage, Anthony Whaymand , of Baldock, Colin Chantler of Huntingdon and Robert Knights, of Watford. Sentencing of all those convicted will take place on May 2. An eighth man was found not guilty and a ninth died before coming to trial. Rogers misused revenue forms supplied to the construction industry allowing those who have overpaid tax to claim it back. His Stevenage-based practice boasted 4,600 clients, which if true, the revenue noted, would make it \"the largest of its kind in the home counties\". In reality, a large chunk of the client list was fictional, and one headache for revenue investigators has been sifting real from invented clients. Anonymous death threats were made to two witnesses in the case, according to the revenue, to prevent them from testifying. Although Rogers's practice has been closed down, the revenue believes similar tax fraud is being carried out elsewhere in the east Midlands and northern home counties and a major inquiry is continuing. Information supplied to the investigation, the revenue said, will be treated in strict confidence. The Rogers case highlights an intensified crackdown on tax offences by the revenue. In December, it emerged that convictions for tax fraud are running at about double the level of a year earlier. Halfway through the financial year, the number of people convicted of serious fiscal offences was about the same as for the whole of 1998/99. Most prosecutions arise from \"aggravating features\" such as false invoicing or lying to revenue officers.",

Lloyds TSB is already the last bank on 125 high streets but analysts estimate that despite this pledge it might be able to take the axe to its 2,300 branch network because of the overlap remaining from the merger between Lloyds and TSB. Industry analysts calculate that as many as 400 town and villages around the country have a Lloyds and a TSB branch, although the bank insisted yesterday that it should not be taken for granted that it would close branches. Giles Radice, chairman of the Treasury select committee, said yesterday that all three banks faced questions on the Cruickshank report, which among other things suggested a competition commission review of small-business banking. Mr Cruickshank, a former telecoms regulator, published his report last month after an 18-month investigation instigated by the chancellor. \"We are taking Cruickshank as our text. We were waiting for Cruickshank [before calling the hearing] and we're going to follow him up,\" Mr Radice said. But it was \"100% certain\" that the bank chief executives would face scrutiny about the more \"populist\" issues such as their branch closure programmes and salaries. Confusion surrounded the reason for the absence of NatWest, the country's biggest supplier of banking services to small businesses. A spokesman for Royal Bank of Scotland, which took over NatWest last month, put it down to a \"simple conflict of diaries\". Last week John Varley, Barclays' chief executive of retail financial services, defended the branch closures, which still leave the bank with the second largest network in the country. The select committee hearing comes at time when banks are being called on to act in a more socially responsible way while also being forced to cut costs to offer the best possible return to their shareholders.",

It also has US technology group Cisco Systems, the networks group, and Intel, the chip maker, as shareholders. </p> <p>Bookham is only offering 19.4m shares in its float but, at the top end of the pricing, the company could be valued at \u00a31bn. The cash it raises will be used to expand its manufacturing operations and invest in new product development. </p> <p>The excitement has centred on its technology which slashes the costs in manufacturing fibre optic components that sit on top of silicon chips. It has set itself apart from competitors which have relied on manually-assembled devices. </p> <p>Yet even Bookham's solid shareholder base and market-leading product may not prevent it from suffering a fall given the volatile trading environment for technology stocks. In the past two weeks, shares in technology and internet related companies have tumbled following the Nasdaq's daily seesaw. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.Lastminute.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Lastminute.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.WorldOnline.com\" target=\"_NEW\">World Online</a> have failed to stay above their issue prices, disappointing investors. Another hi-technology group Eyretel was force to cut the price of its share offering from an indicative range of 195p-240p back to 150p because of the turbulence. </p> <p>Bookham's revenues are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 260% between 1999 and 2001, from \u00a33.5m to \u00a3161m, according to Goldman Sachs which is co-ordinating the float. However, like other technology companies it is loss-making with forecasts that Bookham will move into the black in 2001. A \u00a319m loss is expected to be made this year on turnover of \u00a325.1m. </p> <p>Bookham takes its name from the Surrey village where chief executive Andre Rickman was born.</p>",

The company, which makes fibre optic components, should give confidence to new shareholders and support the price at the top of the \u00a38 to \u00a310-a-share range. First, Oxfordshire-based Bookham boasts a 10-year trading history, unlike many of its technology and dot.com cousins. It also has US technology group Cisco Systems, the networks group, and Intel, the chip maker, as shareholders. Bookham is only offering 19.4m shares in its float but, at the top end of the pricing, the company could be valued at \u00a31bn. The cash it raises will be used to expand its manufacturing operations and invest in new product development. The excitement has centred on its technology which slashes the costs in manufacturing fibre optic components that sit on top of silicon chips. It has set itself apart from competitors which have relied on manually-assembled devices. Yet even Bookham's solid shareholder base and market-leading product may not prevent it from suffering a fall given the volatile trading environment for technology stocks. In the past two weeks, shares in technology and internet related companies have tumbled following the Nasdaq's daily seesaw. Lastminute.com and World Online have failed to stay above their issue prices, disappointing investors. Another hi-technology group Eyretel was force to cut the price of its share offering from an indicative range of 195p-240p back to 150p because of the turbulence. Bookham's revenues are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 260% between 1999 and 2001, from \u00a33.5m to \u00a3161m, according to Goldman Sachs which is co-ordinating the float. However, like other technology companies it is loss-making with forecasts that Bookham will move into the black in 2001. A \u00a319m loss is expected to be made this year on turnover of \u00a325.1m. Bookham takes its name from the Surrey village where chief executive Andre Rickman was born.",

Political scientists have done a lot of work in recent years but it is not merely an academic question. If newspapers do have political influence over their readers, then New Labour may have a problem at the next election, since its brief honeymoon with the Murdoch tabloids is over. There is also the question whether the referendum on Britain's membership of the European monetary union can be won.</p> <p>A problem here is causality. Do Sun readers tend to support the Tories because of their paper's editorial line or because they were Tories to begin with and for that reason choose to read the Sun? This is a tricky question but the 1992 and 1997 general elections provide something of a handle on the problem.</p> <p>Since the Sun's endorsement of Labour came only very late in the campaign in 1997 it is unlikely that this prompted many people to start buying it because they were already Labour voters. It is much more likely that any differences between the voting behaviour of Sun readers in 1992 and 1997 were explained, at least in part, by the change in the paper's alle giance. To be fair, the Sun's endorsement of New Labour was relatively lukewarm compared with its earlier ferocious opposition, but there should be a measurable effect if the newspaper was politically influential.</p> <p>It is important to take into account the fact that even if the Sun's editorial stance had no effect at all on its readers' voting habits, we would still observe differences between Sun readers in 1992 and 1997, because other factors were at work in influencing their votes. Some of these other effects can be taken into account by comparing Sun readers with Mirror readers. If newspapers have a lot of influence, then differences in voting between Sun readers and Mirror readers should have narrowed in 1997 compared with 1992, since the Mirror remained loyal to Labour throughout. In other words the Sun's endorsement of New Labour should have made their readers behave rather more like Mirror readers. The two elections provide a natural experiment for examining this question.</p> <p>The proposition can be examined by means of data extracted from the British election studies: large-scale surveys of the electorate undertaken immediately after polling day. The analysis in the table concentrates on the three major parties, and shows that 39% of Sun readers voted Conservative in 1992 compared with only 14% of Daily Mirror readers. In contrast, 30% of Sun readers voted Labour in that election compared with 63% of Mirror readers. Clearly there were large differences between the readerships of the two newspapers in the election. These differences cannot be attributed to factors such as social class either, which differ greatly between the Sun and the Guardian readerships, but which are very similar in the case of the Sun and the Mirror. Just over half these two tabloids' readers are in working class occupations, and only about 10% are in the professions or in management.</p> <p>The table also shows that by 1997 political differences between the readerships of the two papers narrowed in relation to Conservative voting, but not for Labour voting. Thus support for the Conservatives among Sun readers fell by 16% between the two elections (from 39% to 23%) but by only 8% (from 14% to 6%) for Mirror readers. On the other hand support for New Labour increased by 8% for both papers, although it started from a much higher base in the case of the Mirror.</p> <p>One noticeable change be tween the two elections involved readers who did not vote. About a fifth of Sun readers failed to turn out in 1992, but this increased to nearly a third by 1997. In contrast, the increase in non-voting among Mirror readers was a modest 4%.</p> <p>So it appears that the Sun's switch from strong support for the Tories to lukewarm support for Labour had the effect of discouraging Sun readers either from voting Tory or from voting at all. It did not appear to encourage them to vote Labour or Liberal Democrat. This illustrates the point that newspapers are better at mobilising readers to vote (or abstain) than they are at changing their voting habits. Analysis by a team of researchers in 1997 confirms this result.</p> <p>So what difference might this make to the next election? The answer is that it might be important and a thought experiment shows why. Imagine the Sun had not endorsed Labour in 1997 and this had the effect of producing changes in Conservative voting and abstention among their readers similar to those which occurred among Mirror readers. As a result Tory voting among Sun readers would have declined by 8% instead of 16% and non-voting would have increased by 4% instead of 11%. A quick calculation shows that in those circumstances the Tories would have got an extra half a million votes, assuming that the bulk of the non-voters were Tory supporters. Depending on where they lived these voters would have significantly changed the party composition of the House of Commons. The conclusion has to be that Labour does need a Sun or at least a Murdoch strategy for the next election.</p> <p>Paul Whiteley is professor of politics at Sheffield University</p>",

      "body": "<p> A few days ago I stood in a bar festooned with cardboard cut-out apples promoting a new designer cider, each apple framed by a century-old curlicue motif. A man stood beside me at the bar, his arms tattooed from wrist to armpit in snakes and roses, Viking dragons and angry eagles, all entwined in a writhing scroll of fanciful Celtic bands; a sinuous, hooked and seriffed trelliswork indelibly inked on to his 21st-century skin. I looked too hard and he looked back. This was not the moment to explain that, after visiting the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, where the exhibition Art Nouveau, 1890-1914 has just opened, one sees art nouveau everywhere: in the tendrils of ivy growing on a wall, in the poise of a girl smoking at a bus stop, on the bulging arms of an illustrated man. </p> <p>The repressed always returns, and it was undoubtedly a kind of repression that gave birth to art nouveau. It was as sprawling, digressive and all-encompassing a movement as can be imagined, displaying itself in everything from a building to a brooch, in the gloomy, Nordic paintings of Edvard Munch and in the design of Tiffany table lamps. One might almost see art nouveau as a kind of pervasive, fin-de-siecle disease, which, indeed, it was. It infected and infested architecture, painting and sculpture; it found its form in furniture and in fabrics, in the flat, coloured planes of the popular lithographic poster, in jewellery, couture and hairstyles. It found its living embodiment in the dancer Lo\u00efe Fuller, who writhed and flounced and jittered about the stage in yards of flailing drapery. </p> <p>The style was international, eclectic, easily identified, but almost impossible to define. Art nouveau crossed continents, media, wildly conflicting belief systems. It was decadent and utopian, pure and corrupt. </p> <p>The V&amp;A show gives us a glimpse of all this - from posters of morphine addicts injecting themselves to colour illustrations of sea anemones, from Viking-ship silverware to lampshades and chairs. We visit art- nouveau cities - Paris, Brussels, Helsinki, Glasgow, Munich, Vienna, New York and Budapest. The exhibition traces the roots of art nouveau in Japanese ceramics and woodcuts, and Moorish calligraphy, glassware, marquetry and joinery. The exhibition is as copious, marvellous and horrible as the style itself. I love it and hate it, all at once. </p> <p>It was more than a style, more than a look. It was a mindset, a mentality, a style that had depth as well as an all-encompassing, self-multiplying and mutating breadth. How else to explain what it is that connects the complexity of forms, styles and materials that went into the design and building of Lluis Domenech i Montaner's Palau de la Musica in Barcelona and the four-square, Protestant sobriety of an art school in Amsterdam? Yet something connects them, both to one another and to a bookshop in Oporto, a hotel in Brussels, a Glasgow tea shop and the skylights of a pie-and-mash emporium in Hackney. </p> <p>One of the attributes of the art-nouveau style was its contorted, deformed plasticity, its strange extrudedness and overwrought exoticism. The characteristic art-nouveau line coiled and climbed like smoke, sobbed and swooned like Arab violins. It fragmented into brittle little facets and tessellations. The style was excessive. Lively as art nouveau was - veritably writhing with life - it also, seen en masse in the V&amp;A, strikes me as deathly, a style on the side of death. Little wonder H R Giger took art nouveau as a starting point for his designs for the movie Alien, and that the style was re-used in so many album covers and posters in the psychedelic, psychotic 60s. </p> <p>A whiplash line, let's not forget, begins with a whip. Vitriol and morphine, absinthe and opium begat art nouveau's florid forms, as much as nature ever did (Antoni Gaudi, now en route to sainthood, was apparently a veritable walking pharmacy for much of the time). There's something morbid about so much here - Lalique's beetles and winged female figures, his dragonfly brooches which make you think of awful transmutations of the human and the insect worlds; Mucha's electroplated female heads, von Stuck's personifications of evil in female form, Munch's melancholy - haunted by fears of venereal disease - Guimard's Paris Metro entrances (beguiling gateways to Hell, in my view). How can one look at Belgian designer Phillipe Wolfers's Civilisation and Barbary - an ivory, silver and onyx confection, in which a good part of an elephant's tusk is wound about by a swan and a half-bat, half snake-like serpent - except as an extremely repulsive decoration, probably intended for some Belgian industrialist who had made a lot of money from the heart of darkness itself, the Belgian Congo? The exhibition's curator, Paul Greenhalgh, writes tellingly in the excellent, catalogue, \"The Europeans occupied and to a considerable extent asset-stripped the globe. As they did so, they voraciously consumed the cultures of the world and made them their own.\" </p> <p>This, in part, is what art nouveau came to represent, as the consummate art of conspicuous consumption. A view, in the catalogue, of Fyodor Shekhtel's main stairway from the dining room of the Riabushinsky mansion in Moscow is the stuff of nightmares. The curving staircase with its sea-swell balustrade is like a journey through the inner ear. The overall effect I can only describe as queasily decadent. Descending into the Paris Metro, through one of Guimard's station entrances, taking a coffee in a Brussels cafe, walking the streets of Barcelona, one is aware that art nouveau, the final efflorescence of the neo-gothic and the neo-rococo, the mannerist and the Moorish, needed to have its day, and needed to be replaced by something cleaner, straighter, something more rational. </p> <p>Art nouveau, looked at, as it were, through the wrong end of the telescope of modernism, was a fascinating, fabulously excessive aberration. That we owe so much of our own, belated modernity to it, and to the reaction against it, that gave us clean lines and unadorned geometry, is not in doubt. It was a sort of devil's crucible, giving off poisonous fumes, just like a bowl of vitriol. </p> <p>\u0095 Art Nouveau, 1890-1914, is at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London SW7 (0171-942 2000), till July 30.</p>",

It found its living embodiment in the dancer Lo\u00efe Fuller, who writhed and flounced and jittered about the stage in yards of flailing drapery. The style was international, eclectic, easily identified, but almost impossible to define. Art nouveau crossed continents, media, wildly conflicting belief systems. It was decadent and utopian, pure and corrupt. The V&amp;A show gives us a glimpse of all this - from posters of morphine addicts injecting themselves to colour illustrations of sea anemones, from Viking-ship silverware to lampshades and chairs. We visit art- nouveau cities - Paris, Brussels, Helsinki, Glasgow, Munich, Vienna, New York and Budapest. The exhibition traces the roots of art nouveau in Japanese ceramics and woodcuts, and Moorish calligraphy, glassware, marquetry and joinery. The exhibition is as copious, marvellous and horrible as the style itself. I love it and hate it, all at once. It was more than a style, more than a look. It was a mindset, a mentality, a style that had depth as well as an all-encompassing, self-multiplying and mutating breadth. How else to explain what it is that connects the complexity of forms, styles and materials that went into the design and building of Lluis Domenech i Montaner's Palau de la Musica in Barcelona and the four-square, Protestant sobriety of an art school in Amsterdam? Yet something connects them, both to one another and to a bookshop in Oporto, a hotel in Brussels, a Glasgow tea shop and the skylights of a pie-and-mash emporium in Hackney. One of the attributes of the art-nouveau style was its contorted, deformed plasticity, its strange extrudedness and overwrought exoticism. The characteristic art-nouveau line coiled and climbed like smoke, sobbed and swooned like Arab violins. It fragmented into brittle little facets and tessellations. The style was excessive. Lively as art nouveau was - veritably writhing with life - it also, seen en masse in the V&amp;A, strikes me as deathly, a style on the side of death. Little wonder H R Giger took art nouveau as a starting point for his designs for the movie Alien, and that the style was re-used in so many album covers and posters in the psychedelic, psychotic 60s. A whiplash line, let's not forget, begins with a whip. Vitriol and morphine, absinthe and opium begat art nouveau's florid forms, as much as nature ever did (Antoni Gaudi, now en route to sainthood, was apparently a veritable walking pharmacy for much of the time). There's something morbid about so much here - Lalique's beetles and winged female figures, his dragonfly brooches which make you think of awful transmutations of the human and the insect worlds; Mucha's electroplated female heads, von Stuck's personifications of evil in female form, Munch's melancholy - haunted by fears of venereal disease - Guimard's Paris Metro entrances (beguiling gateways to Hell, in my view). How can one look at Belgian designer Phillipe Wolfers's Civilisation and Barbary - an ivory, silver and onyx confection, in which a good part of an elephant's tusk is wound about by a swan and a half-bat, half snake-like serpent - except as an extremely repulsive decoration, probably intended for some Belgian industrialist who had made a lot of money from the heart of darkness itself, the Belgian Congo? The exhibition's curator, Paul Greenhalgh, writes tellingly in the excellent, catalogue, \"The Europeans occupied and to a considerable extent asset-stripped the globe. As they did so, they voraciously consumed the cultures of the world and made them their own.\" This, in part, is what art nouveau came to represent, as the consummate art of conspicuous consumption. A view, in the catalogue, of Fyodor Shekhtel's main stairway from the dining room of the Riabushinsky mansion in Moscow is the stuff of nightmares. The curving staircase with its sea-swell balustrade is like a journey through the inner ear. The overall effect I can only describe as queasily decadent. Descending into the Paris Metro, through one of Guimard's station entrances, taking a coffee in a Brussels cafe, walking the streets of Barcelona, one is aware that art nouveau, the final efflorescence of the neo-gothic and the neo-rococo, the mannerist and the Moorish, needed to have its day, and needed to be replaced by something cleaner, straighter, something more rational. Art nouveau, looked at, as it were, through the wrong end of the telescope of modernism, was a fascinating, fabulously excessive aberration. That we owe so much of our own, belated modernity to it, and to the reaction against it, that gave us clean lines and unadorned geometry, is not in doubt. It was a sort of devil's crucible, giving off poisonous fumes, just like a bowl of vitriol. \u0095 Art Nouveau, 1890-1914, is at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London SW7 (0171-942 2000), till July 30.",

Inner City Jam, his first production as director, is hard-hitting, at times grim, but always colourful. It seems tailor-made for large London audiences, so you might wonder, as I did, why the month-long run is in Leeds. </p> <p>Last year, when Inner City Jam appeared as a fringe production at London's Cockpit Theatre, the critics loved it. Time Out praised its \"show-stopping voices, spectacular dancing and great character acting\". It is not uncommercial (it was once a smash on Broadway) but has been forced out of the capital because there is nowhere else for developing theatre to go. Like many productions, Inner City Jam is now too large for fringe but too small for the West End. So there might be a few red faces if Medford succeeds in his plan to ship Inner City Jam to the major theatres via Leeds. </p> <p>The problem is less conservatism on the part of West End theatre than huge rents and the lack of subsidies. Bigger unsubsidised theatres won't take a risk on a relatively unproven project when a guaranteed blockbuster will pay the bills. Elsewhere, however, subsidies are more widespread and West Yorkshire Playhouse, where Inner City Jam appears, is forging a national reputation for innovative musical theatre. Last year's Deadmeat was set in a club and fused drum'n'bass and drama, while Carnival Messiah mixed reggae and Handel to rapturous reviews. And Spend Spend Spend, often touted as a \"new\" smash in London, was developed at the Playhouse almost two years ago. </p> <p>\"Thank God for regional theatres that are interested in development,\" says Inner City Jam's producer, Shezwae Powell, a New Yorker who has lived in England for 15 years but is still amazed at the gulf in theatrical opportunity in the capital. \"It's ironic that you have to go out of town in order to get back into town. What London really needs is an 'off Broadway', where pieces can develop their way into the West End.\" </p> <p>Inner City Jam aims to go beyond entertainment, providing a real insight into the reasons for the continued existence of an underclass. It is a risky production, not least because it involves no stars. There is little by way of plot, either. It fuses short stories and the experiences of its characters into a compelling portrait of how a society within a society perpetuates itself, with little chance of escape. When a drug addict \"falls in love\" with a pregnant teenager, it is because he fancies taking heroin in her cosy flat, rather than on the street. When a God- fearing mother devotes her life to protecting her son from the \"wicked\" local influences, he ends up getting hit by a stray bullet. </p> <p>Inner City Jam is a personal crusade for Powell and Medford, who met while Powell was in Starlight Express. Both noticed that problems within theatre mirror society's lack of opportunity for black people. \"It's better now, but the casting still tends to be a bit faddish, stereotypical,\" says Powell. \"In the past the excuse was, 'There isn't enough good talent around' but how can good talent get better without practice and exposure?\" </p> <p>The project got under way when Powell gave Medford a tape of the original soundtrack - by Aretha Franklin songwriter Helen Miller - of the 1971 Broadway production of Inner City Jam. \"I was on the Euston Road just passing King's Cross in a lot of traffic one rainy afternoon and one of the songs came on,\" says Medford, who was a member of Kid Creole &amp; the Coconuts before joining EastEnders. \"I just thought, 'Yes, this is really funky.' \" </p> <p>When the tape ended, Mary J Blige came on the radio doing a cover of Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin. \"It all seemed like the same place. The 70s revival thing was happening and I just thought we could do the same with the musical. So we reworked the songs, orchestrated them, and left a couple of dodgy ones in for the comedy value. Voil\u00e0 - musical theatre!\" </p> <p>They also relocated it to King's Cross, but as Medford explains, it could equally be any city with urban homelessness. \"It could be Leeds. Most people here are familiar with King's Cross anyway, because if you travel to London by train that's the first thing you see. I grew up slightly fascinated by it, yes. The drug deals, the murders, but mainly the characters.

The themes - homelessness, disenfranchisement, lack of real community - are sadly timeless but the production is hugely positive. </p> <p>\"It's a combination of MTV videos and soap opera,\" says Medford, a bundle of enthusiasm who still gets called Kelvin despite leaving EastEnders almost 10 years ago. </p> <p>\"I used to walk around London and see all these disused buildings that I thought could be used to help the homeless.

It is as if the Queen had been caught fiddling her expenses.</p> <p> Except that it's not quite that clear-cut. Cronje has not admitted to match-fixing. Overnight, he admitted to \"being dishonest\". Now, he has confessed to selling information to a bookmaker, for $10,000-15,000. That was during the triangular one-day series involving England and Zimbabwe, which South Africa won. So Cronje's claim that he never sold a game stands up - for the moment. Last week, it seemed inconceivable; this morning, it still seemed improbable. Now, well, you're not sure who to believe. It would help if Cronje had appeared at this afternoon's press conference himself, instead of leaving it to Dr Ali Bacher to speak for him.</p> <p>It is an ignominious end to a long and distinguished reign. Cronje was not quite a great captain, but he was a very good one. He took over at the tender age of 25 - something that Mike Atherton, for one, found a daunting task - yet his authority was unquestioned. With Bacher and Bob Woolmer, he formed one of the great management teams. Bacher handled PR, politics and diplomacy, both internal and international; Woolmer supplied tactical imagination and innovation; Cronje was a rock, on and off the field, leading by example with his ungainly-but-effective front-footed batting, standing thunderously at mid-off and carefully nursing his two great new-ball bowlers, Donald and Pollock. </p> <p> He argued with the UCBSA over quotas, but that didn't make him a racist. The two regular non-white players in the team both flourished under his wing. He helped turn Paul Adams from a novelty act into a proper Test wrist-spinner, and in New Zealand a year ago, he deliberately let a Test match die in order to give Herschelle Gibbs, newly promoted to open the innings, the chance to make a double-hundred. Gibbs never looked back, at least not until he dropped Steve Waugh on that fateful afternoon at Headingley last June. </p> <p> Cronje could be inflexible and defensive, but captains are judged by results and his were excellent: he won exactly half his 54 Tests in charge, and lost only 11. He leaves South Africa in second place in the Wisden World Championship; briefly, when the table began late in 1996, they led it. His finest hour came in 1998-99, when West Indies played Tests in South Africa for the first time, and were hammered 5-0. Despite having to play a vast number of one-day internationals, he won nearly three-quarters of them. Cronje's team had everything except the ability to come through in the very tightest situations. In Australia in 1997-98 Steve Waugh called them \"chokers\" . It was harsh, and uncalled-for, but not exactly unfair. They lost that one-day series after dominating its early stages, a pattern that was to be repeated in England two summers running. First they allowed England, under Alkec Stewart, to come back from the dead and win a Test series 2-1, then, in the World Cup, South Africa were the best team early on, and the second-best one overall, yet did not reach the final, but went out, agonisingly, on a tie.</p> <p> Cronje confessed to being haunted by that result - \"I keep asking myself, where was that one run?\" - yet he bounced back strongly. He lost Woolmer, and his own batting form, and was handled insensitively by a new chairman of selectors, yet he still won all four of South Africa's Test series in 1999-2000. He brushed aside Zimbabwe home and away, and gained revenge over England at home, belying his dour reputation by doing a deal with Nasser Hussain to convert a rain-ruined Test into a crowd-pleasing run- chase. Cronje lost the match, but won friends. Then he took his team to India, and, before the fatal one-day series, won a two-Test series 2-0 - India's first home defeat for 13 years.</p> <p>That was an extraordinary result. But nothing like as extraordinary as this.</p> <p><em>Tim de Lisle is editor of wisden.com and Wisden Cricket Monthly.</em></p>",
