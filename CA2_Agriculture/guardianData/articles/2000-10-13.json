On that late evening in November 1995 when their leader and hero, Yitzhak Rabin, was gunned down by a fellow Jew, they saw their world fall apart. Not only was the Israeli nation eating itself, it was also destroying the country's best chance for peace. Rabin had signed the Oslo accords with the Palestinians two years earlier - a feat only a man with his trusted military credentials could have pulled off. With him gone, the road to peace would be blocked.</p> <p>Now the Israeli left has realised that November 1995 was not the all-time low; things can get even worse. As one liberal Tel Aviv commentator put it yesterday, the mood is \"a gloomy blend of depression, anxiety and despair\".</p> <p>The immediate source of heartache is grief for what has been a fortnight of blood. They have seen their own people killed, along with a hundred Palestinians, including children. They hate what Israel is doing to its neighbours and they hate what this war is doing to them: making them the brutal occupier once more.</p> <p>But the pain goes deeper than mourning. The Israeli left is depressed to see years of progress reversed. They are shaking their heads in disbelief that Rabin's heir as the soldier-turned-peacemaker, Ehud Barak, has invited Ariel Sharon into his cabinet. Sharon is not only the man who ignited the current inferno - taking a stroll in the most contested piece of real estate in the world - he is also remembered by Palestinians and Israelis alike as the villain of the 1982 Lebanon war. That conflict was a defining moment for the Israeli peace movement, not least the Lebanese massacres of Palestinian refugees at Sabra and Shatila which took place under Sharon's nose. After that, Israel's own Kahan commission of inquiry branded Sharon unfit to serve as defence minister. Yet now he is back.</p> <p>The left is depressed to see its own leaders looking like strangers. In a CNN interview on Thursday, Barak's face was a taut, glaring study of fury. \"Bullshit!\" he bellowed to one question, all diplomatic niceties dropped. That same night the Nobel laureate, Rabin's partner Shimon Peres, appeared before a Jewish audience in London seeking to build support for Israel. Usually Peres is criticised as a naive idealist, dreaming of a Middle East living in hi-tech, e-commerce harmony. But here he was back on a 1970s agenda, arguing that the Jewish claim on Jerusalem was twice as old as the Muslim one and that the Palestinians should be grateful: Israel would give them a state when none of the Arab nations had ever done the same. Even the dreamer Peres has started talking like a Likudnik.</p> <p>But the root of the left's dismay lies with the Palestinians. For three decades, Israel's peaceniks have told their fellow citizens that one day they will have to make a painful compromise and share the land with their neighbours, the Palestinians. For years they were lambasted as traitors, for daring to propose the handover of territory. But slowly, with the election of Rabin and then Barak, they began to win the argument. This year, for the first time in Israel's 52-year history, a majority had come round to the notion of an independent Palestinian state. At Camp David in July, Barak went even further, proposing the partial handover of East Jerusalem and even agreeing to place the ultra-contentious holy sites outside Jewish control. By common consent, this package was the most generous Israel had ever offered: the chances of Barak getting it past Israeli public opinion were slim.</p> <p>Yet even this, the Israeli left now realises, was not enough. Yasser Arafat did not accept it. Instead, say Israel's peaceniks, he returned to a war footing, encouraging this new intifada. For the peace camp this has been a humiliation. The Israeli right had always regarded dealing with Arafat the way Ian Paisley regards talking to Sinn Fein: \"Negotiations are doomed; as soon as things don't go their way, they'll start fighting again.\" The left had insisted that, no, Arafat was sincere; he had chosen the path of talks and compromise. Even if the Palestinians don't get their way immediately, said the left, they'll carry on talking. Now the right looks vindicated and the left looks naive.</p> <p>That's why the Israeli left feels so betrayed by the Palestinians: Barak offered them a fair deal and they have thrown it back in his face. Now the Palestinians will get a rightwing, Likud regime who will give them nothing.</p> <p>To the Palestinians, of course, it all looks very different. Given their starting point - that Israel was the historic interloper - none of these \"handovers\" looks much like concessions. After all, Israel should never have been there in the first place. Far from being grateful to receive the West Bank and Gaza, Arafat sees these as merely partial restoration of what should be rightfully his. He is a man who's been mugged and is suddenly meant to be grateful when the mugger offers him 70p for the bus fare home. None of the little enclaves Israel was prepared to concede amounts to a viable state and nor was there any point staying at the table: the Americans were in charge and they are on Israel's side.</p> <p>Given that vast gulf or perception, what hope can there be for reconciliation? The dreamers hope Arafat will wake up to reality, realise that Barak is his best hope and agree at least to discuss the Camp David deal. Then Barak will persuade his nation to forget the past two weeks, give him another shot and trust the Palestinians once more. He will then hand over lots of land and spend billions to redress five decades of apartheid-style discrimination endured by the one million Palestinian citizens within Israel's borders.</p> <p>So much for the dream. The better course for optimists may be pessimism. They should assume that Barak is finished and that he will be ejected as soon as elections are called. Sharon or even Binyamin Netanyahu will then take over, elected on a promise of no surrender. But reality will soon impinge, even on them. It will take longer and they will do it through gritted teeth, but a Likud government will eventually have to make a deal with the Palestinians - probably the very same package on offer at Camp David in July.</p> <p>There is a precedent. After all, it was not a Labour PM who returned Sinai to Egypt, but the Likud's Menachem Begin. It was Nixon who went to China. So perhaps it will take Ariel Sharon to share Jerusalem with the Palestinians - and to confront and even evict those Jewish settlers from the lands that will finally have to be handed over.</p> <p>That is a pessimistic sort of optimism, the hope that a peace available three months ago will materialise three, five or 10 years from now. But it may be the best hope the peace camp, Israeli and Palestinian, have got. These two peoples have no choice but to share the land they both love. Whether they do that now or later, with Arafat and Barak or a new generation of leaders, is up to them. But they will do it - for it is the choice of life over death.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto: jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\"> jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",

A panel of three judges at the court of appeal in Edinburgh ruled that the orders contravened the European convention on human rights as they required convicted criminals to prove they had made their money lawfully. The three judges said that this took away the presumption of innocence, but a spokesman for the crown office said it was considering an appeal. The ruling was made after lawyers acting for Robert McIntosh, a convicted drug trafficker, challenged a confiscation order which was made under the Proceeds of Crime (Scotland) Act. McIntosh, 38, from Greenock, was jailed for four years at the high court in Paisley in June 1999 after pleading guilty to supplying heroin. A spokesman for the Scottish executive said it would continue its drive to confiscate profits made on the back of illegal activity, and in the light of yesterday's ruling, would look at ways of amending current legislation.",

The schoolchildren in Bethlehem - some of only a handful whose schools are still open - are in shock, says Ghazaleh. They know that more than 100 Palestinians, many of them children, have been killed; all they talk of is blood and shooting, they jump at loud noises.

Every reporter this week has commented on the extent of the rage of those throwing stones in Gaza and Ramallah and Galilee; but why did it take the world by surprise? Palestinians on the ground - as opposed to those involved in peace talks - have been saying for years that they are disillusioned with this peace process, and for tangible reasons of poverty and exclusion, rather than simply politics. If the world had listened to the warnings, it might have been able to tackle the causes of the uprising before it was too late.</p> <p>A report by church charity World Vision stated it baldly back in May 1999: \"an increasing sense of disillusionment with the peace process by Palestinians may well ignite future violence\". The figures are startling: Palestinian GNP has fallen by 35% since the start of the Oslo peace process in 1993; unemployment has reached record levels, up to 40% in some areas; the average income is $1,500 per head in the West Bank and Gaza, compared with $2,500 in 1987, and with $17,000 in Israel. The closure policy, whereby cities are cut off from each other, has had disastrous economic and social consequences - disrupting trade, but also feeding a mounting sense of injustice. As a tourist with a British passport you are free to travel wherever you like in the West Bank, Gaza and Israel; but a Muslim Palestinian from Ramallah may not visit Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque, 10 miles away; and a Christian Palestinian from Bethlehem may not visit the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the site of Christ's crucifixion, a distance of seven miles.</p> <p>About 18 months ago, I visited the Amari refugee camp between Jerusalem and Ramallah. The makeshift homes are poor and far too small for the large families who live in them, but inside they are neat, with wall-hangings of Mecca and mosque-shaped clocks. A Palestinian woman there, while bringing me tea, apologised for the fact that her children had dirty faces and clothes; it was because the camp received water only twice a week, she said. I looked up the hill to see a gleaming settlement, Bet-El, illegally built on Palestinian land outside of Israel, the grass on its lawns green and lush, watered with sprinklers.</p> <p>No wonder there is rage. Ordinary Palestinians always felt that the peace process was weighted against them - a fact apparently reflected by an anonymous Israeli government source quoted this week in the Independent: \"The Palestinians always complain that we know the details of every proposal from the Americans before they do,\" he said. \"There's a good reason for that; we write them.\"</p> <p>The Palestinians have always known that they are the racial underclass, but the overwhelmingly unequal nature of the conflict is so often left out of the peace equation. This is not a Balkan-style confrontation of two ancient hatreds. It was European Christians, not Muslims or Arabs, who led the persecution and ghettoisation of the Jewish people for most of the past 2,000 years. This is a modern conflict over land between an occupier and a subject people, the occupation long accepted as illegal by the United Nations; between a state with all the cards (a hugely powerful army, the support of the world's only superpower, control of electricity, water, most of the land) and a population with none. It is not a war between equals, and it is overwhelmingly Palestinians who are being killed.</p> <p>An end to conflict must be the priority. But peace does not happen just because we want it to - if the Palestinian population does not believe it has received justice, it's clear that there will not be peace. Ehud Barak, the prime minister of Israel, may have gone as far as he could at Camp David, and his public may not allow him to go further in the current circumstances. But in its own interests, Israel will have to do so, sooner or later. The \"East Jerusalem\" earmarked for the Palestinians at Camp David did not include the Arab part of the Old City, the bustling Damascus Gate, the shop-lined Salah al-Din Street or the Mount of Olives - all of which are currently Arab sections of the city. The \"East Jerusalem\" on offer at Camp David in fact effectively constituted the suburb of Abu Dis and the village of Bethany - like asking for Trafalgar Square and being required to settle for Croydon. No Palestinian leader could accept it and survive.</p> <p>There is a solution, probably still some way off, although the peace process went some way towards it. Yesterday I asked a Palestinian in Ramallah how this will end. \"The only end would be the end of the occupation,\" he said, his phone conversation broken up by the sound of shooting. If Palestine becomes a state, if Israel withdraws from all of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, if the UN provides protection for and access to the religious sites, and if the issue of the right to return for refugees is addressed, then the Palestinian community seems likely to accept the loss of pre-1967 Israel and a permanent peace has a chance.</p> <p>Next week, if the Bethlehem schools are still open, Raeda Ghazaleh's theatre company will be performing another play; about a boy's search for his grandfather, and how this helps him understand himself. Like him, we must understand the history of the Palestinian people and the reality of their conflict with Israel if we are to understand their situation now, and if we have any hope of finding a solution.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:katharine.viner@theguardian.com\">katharine.viner@theguardian.com</a></p>",

He died on Whitecliffe Parade, close to the home of his grandfather, Francisco Notorantonio, 66, victim of a loyalist gunman 13 years ago this week. That murder is now centre stage in Scotland Yard investigations into suspected collusion between the security forces and terrorists. Until a high court victory yesterday, the Sunday People was injuncted from revealing more about the killing of Mr Notorantonio, a retired taxi driver, who was shot in bed as he slept beside his wife. A secret army unit is accused of having persuaded one of its agents within loyalism to target the father of 11 to protect its high-ranking IRA source. Mr O'Connor's murder came as the two-month-old dispute within loyalism on Shankill Road was showing signs of abating. It has claimed three lives and seen more than 200 families forced from their homes. The rival Ulster Freedom Fighters and Ulster Volunteer Force are now in talks. The RUC made a series of arrests immediately after the murder. They also seized a grenade launcher and warheads in the nearby republican Poleglass estate and linked them to dissident activity. Feuds within republicanism are bloody. The most recent, linked to the Irish National Liberation Army five years ago, saw several of its main players murdered. Mr O'Connor's colleagues are likely to seek retaliation.",

Jerusalem Since the 1967 war, Israel has had control over the entire city, including the Arab districts of East Jerusalem and the holy sites of three religions, Judaism, Islam and Christianity. However, the day-to-day running of the Haram al-Sharif - sacred to the Jews as the Temple Mount - was handed back to the Muslim religious authorities, the Waqf.

His hesitation offered a window of opportunity to Ariel Sharon, to provoke a direct confrontation over sovereignty in Jerusalem, before talks could be restarted. Refugees More than 3.6m Palestinian refugees living in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria have clung to the hope that UN resolutions would be fulfilled, promising them a right of return to the homes they abandoned in 1948 and 1967. However, this was never going to be acceptable to Israel. Most of the refugees' property had been taken over, and a return of the Palestinian diaspora would create an Arab majority in Israel.

The deal could easily have triggered a political crisis in Jordan, Lebanon and other host nations. Settlers The greatest barrier to the transfer of the West Bank to Palestinian control was the presence of 200,000 Jewish settlers who had established communities there, ranging from tiny hilltop outposts to huge concrete citadels around Jerusalem. The settlers included some of the most radical nationalist Jewish groups, many whom came from the US with a mission to repopulate Biblical lands.

In Chicago a rabbi narrowly escaped injury when his car was sprayed by bullets in a drive-by shooting, and three Palestinian youths were being questioned by police for allegedly slinging marbles at Jewish passersby from a van. \"When things flare up there [in the Middle East], Arabs and Muslims act in solidarity with their brethren there with illegal acts here,\" said Jay Tcath, the director of the Jewish community relations council in the city. Two South African police officers were stabbed when a protest degenerated into running battles outside the US embassy in Pretoria. Demonstrators were eventually dispersed by water canon. The worst violence was in France where unidentified arsonists set fire to five synagogues overnight. More than 70 anti-semitic incidents - ranging from arson to shouted insults - have been recorded by the police during the latest crisis. The synagogue attacks were in Bondy and Garges-les-Gonesses in the Seine-Saint-Denis area north of Paris, in the Belleville quarter of the capital, at Longjumeau south of the city and in the southwest city of Toulouse. There were no casualties and damage was slight. The front doors of two Jewish families in Orly, south of Paris, were also set alight. Anti-semitic graffiti was found on walls in another northern Paris suburb, Le Blanc Mesnil, which has a large immigrant population from north Africa. Jewish community leaders claim the attacks are predominantly the work of disaffected Arab youths. There are some 5m Muslims in France; some of their leaders, notably the Paris imam, Dalil Boubakeur, have called for calm and dialogue with Jewish groups. There are around 750,000 Jews in France, mostly around Paris. In London, Jewish groups warned that militant Muslim groups had distributed leaflets calling for the death of Jews. \"There have been fundamentalist organisations not calling for the killing of Israelis, but of Jews. It is very inciteful material,\" said Mike Whine, a spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews. \"Volunteers have been placed in and around synagogues and police are proactively patrolling Jewish areas\". Mr Whine said recent attacks on Britain's estimated 280,000-strong Jewish community had been largely confined to synagogue vandalism. \"We have advised the high level of alert will continue for the foreseeable future. But we've had nothing like the problems other countries are experiencing.\" About 300 people gathered for a peaceful protest outside Central London Mosque in Regent's Park, northwest London, after Friday afternoon prayers.",

Disputes over freedom of travel, land and water have exacerbated economic decline. Palestinians claimed yester day that there would be no threat of a return to war had the economic disparity between the two sides been tackled. The hoped-for economic boom in the aftermath of the Olso peace accord between the Israelis and the Palestinians in 1993 never materialised. Instead, the number of Palestinians below the poverty line is estimated to have risen from 20.1% in 1997 to 23.3% the following year. Dr Jad Isaac, the director of the Applied Research Institute in Jerusalem, said yesterday: \"For peace to be sustainable there should be equality in distribution of resources.\" He said the Israelis had a disproportionate amount of land. Unable to reach his office yesterday because of street clashes in Jerusalem, and with no access to his notes, he was still able to reel off a series of figures on the gap between the two sides. He said that although Israel had a population of some 6m and the Palestinians 3m, the Israelis had 2.1m hectares of land compared with the Palestinians' 0.6m. Mr Isaac, who has just completed a paper on the scarcity of resources and the peace process, which he is to present soon in Washington, said the Israelis had access to 2bn cubic metres of water compared to the Palestinians' 232m cubic metres. \"It is easy to make a desert bloom when you take the water,\" Afif Safieh, head of the Palestinian delegation to London, said yesterday, adding that the River Jordan was low because Israel had diverted most of the water for its own use. The Palestinian Authority's problems were made worse by Israeli checkpoints making travel difficult between Gaza and the West Bank as well as within the West Bank. Mr Safieh said: \"You have to pass through different checkpoints and multiple passes. They want to cripple Palestinian society and prevent the promising land from economic take-off.\" An Israeli government spokesman said water was an issue but one to be discussed as part of the peace process, as would mobility. He attributed some of the Palestinian problems to the way Mr Arafat runs the Palestinian Authority, with a high level of public money spent on the police and other public servants. The police force during the Oslo talks had originally been estimated at 7,000 but has since grown to well over 30,000. There was also corruption within the authority, he claimed. About 120,000 Palestinians pass into Israel each day to work and the Israeli spokesman said that, contrary to Palestinian claims of disruption, there had not been a single closure of the border since Ehud Barak became prime minister in July 1999, at least up until the present violence. Palestinian claims about poverty are supported in part by the UN development programme. In its report this year it said: \"The Palestinians are still suffering from the legacy of the prolonged occupation, which has a striking impact on their deteriorating social and economic conditions.\" It put unemployment at 17.9%. \"On the top of these constraints are the increasing pressure on the natural resources due to the accelerated population growth, growing Palestinian urbanisation requirements and the expansion of the Israeli settlements and military infrastructure, restricted access to water and other natural resources, and limited sovereignty over land use,\" the report added.",

The deal will give the company cash to spend on expanding its five-strong chain of middle-market Fish restaurants, which chairman Tony Allan believes could become a nationwide concept. </p> <p>Mr Allan opened the first Bank eaterie in Aldwych, pictured above, four years ago. It became well known for its busy atmosphere and its canteen-like decor, and a second site was recently opened in Birmingham. </p> <p>However, Mr Allan believes the growth prospects for the two restaurants, together with the group's Zander site in London, are restricted. \"As far as expansion's concerned, the Bank brand is limited and the return on capital is nowhere near Fish's,\" he said. </p> <p>The buyout team includes Christian Delteil, who runs the Bank restaurants, and Leigh Collins - a former boss of the stockbroker Collins Stewart. </p> <p>Mr Allan will be non-executive chairman of the buyout company, in addition to remaining at BGR, and has invested about \u00a3300,000 of his own money in the business. </p> <p>Under the terms of the transaction, BGR will initially receive \u00a310.25m in cash, with a further \u00a3775,000 if the restaurants meet performance targets. The buyout team will fund the deal through a placing of shares with institutions, with a flotation on the Alternative Investment Market to follow. </p> <p>However, the deal was criticised in some quarters. One analyst said: \"The whole thing looks a bit fishy, if you'll pardon the pun. These sites are being sold to the existing management team, and the financing's not in place.\" </p> <p>Industry experts believe the three sites make annual profits of about \u00a31.3m.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Restaurant group BGR is to sell its three Bank and Zander sites and change its name to Fish. The signature sites will be sold to a buyout team for up to \u00a311.02m. The deal will give the company cash to spend on expanding its five-strong chain of middle-market Fish restaurants, which chairman Tony Allan believes could become a nationwide concept. Mr Allan opened the first Bank eaterie in Aldwych, pictured above, four years ago. It became well known for its busy atmosphere and its canteen-like decor, and a second site was recently opened in Birmingham. However, Mr Allan believes the growth prospects for the two restaurants, together with the group's Zander site in London, are restricted. \"As far as expansion's concerned, the Bank brand is limited and the return on capital is nowhere near Fish's,\" he said. The buyout team includes Christian Delteil, who runs the Bank restaurants, and Leigh Collins - a former boss of the stockbroker Collins Stewart. Mr Allan will be non-executive chairman of the buyout company, in addition to remaining at BGR, and has invested about \u00a3300,000 of his own money in the business. Under the terms of the transaction, BGR will initially receive \u00a310.25m in cash, with a further \u00a3775,000 if the restaurants meet performance targets. The buyout team will fund the deal through a placing of shares with institutions, with a flotation on the Alternative Investment Market to follow. However, the deal was criticised in some quarters. One analyst said: \"The whole thing looks a bit fishy, if you'll pardon the pun. These sites are being sold to the existing management team, and the financing's not in place.\" Industry experts believe the three sites make annual profits of about \u00a31.3m.",

      "bodyText": "Ariel Sharon, poised to bulldoze his way back into power in Israel, has long been associated with some of the bloodiest chapters in his country's 50-year conflict with the Arabs. Last night Mr Sharon, leader of the opposition Likud party, was still considering the request from the prime minister, Ehud Barak, to join an emergency national unity coalition following the violent collapse of the peace process. So far the 72-year-old maverick has made no formal response, but sources close to him were quoted as saying he would take up the offer - but on his own terms. As so often before in his long and rocky career, many people believe this larger-than-life hawkish figure is more of a problem than a solution. It was his visit to the mosques of Jerusalem's Temple Mount (Haram al-Sharif) last month that triggered the present crisis. It was widely seen as a deliberate provocation. Yet even if it was a little disingenuous for Mr Sharon to claim that he was only another Jew visiting a holy site, his move was more the pretext for than the cause of the explosion of Palestinian anger that followed. Israeli observers believe the Likud leader had his own motives: highlighting objections to Mr Barak's readiness to make concessions over Jerusalem; and vying to keep his own party position in the face of a possible challenge from his predecessor, the former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu. Mr Barak's call to Mr Sharon to join a unity government seems to be another large nail in the coffin of the peace process, a clear lurch to the right after the mortal blows of recent weeks. Palestinians and many Israelis remember him most for being the architect of the disastrous 1982 invasion of Lebanon, when as defence minister he tried to destroy the PLO militarily so he would not have to deal with it politically. In what turned out to be the most unpopular and divisive war in the country's history he was accused of misleading his own prime minister and was forced to step down after being found indirectly responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacres of Palestinians by Israel's Lebanese Christian allies. He has been wreathed in controversy ever since he was a young army officer, commanding a unit that launched punitive raids against Jordan and Egypt in the 1950s. In one of them, at Qibya, scores of civilians were massacred. Much decorated for his brilliant exploits and \u00e9lan - though his heroism has often been questioned and mocked by his many critics - he led the Israeli counter-attack across the Suez Canal in 1973. In the early 1970s, as head of the army's southern command he was responsible for a brutal crackdown on Palestinian resistance activities in the Gaza Strip. Later, like many Israeli generals, he went into politics, using his position as agriculture minister under Menachem Begin to patronise and expand Jewish settlements all over the West Bank, delighting in showing journalists the detailed maps and the spade he carried in his car boot. Running a succession of ministries he made no secret of his goal his of \"creating facts\" on the ground to make it impossible to compromise on territory with the Palestinians. Subterfuge was always part of his strategy. Unsurprisingly, he opposed the 1993 Oslo peace agreement from the start, insisting that Yasser Arafat, the PLO leader, could never be trusted. On that point, he is consistent: \"Every time Arafat wants to put some more pressure on Israel, he turns to violence,\" he protested after the Temple Mount incident on September 28. \"For him, terror is a tool in the negotiating process.\" Sharon has had personal tragedies, losing a son and recently his wife Lily, who shared his rambling Negev ranch and their heavily-guarded home in the Muslim quarter of Jerusalem's Old City. With a controversial past and a central role in an uncertain future, he still casts a giant shadow over his own people - and their enemies. \"This man is connected with catastrophes for the Palestinians,\" said Yasser Abed-Rabbo, minister of culture in the Palestinian Authority. Many Israelis feel the same.",

The captives - thought to include five or six Americans, two Frenchmen, a Chilean and an Argentinian - were abducted by six masked gunmen and flown by helicopter to neighbouring Colombia by a group claiming to be Colombian rebels, said military officials in the Ecuadorean capital, Quito. Ecuador's vice-president, Pedro Pinto, said the leftwing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) had claimed that the kidnapping was in reprisal for Plan Colombia, an anti-drug trafficking initiative backed by $1.3bn (\u00a3885m) in US aid. But rebel spokesman Carlos Antonio Lozada said: \"I can assure you with total security that the Farc has nothing to do with this incident.\" Farc rebels, whose field commanders operate with substantial autonomy, have had to backpedal on similar denials in the past. Last month, a guerrilla hijacked a commuter plane and forced it down at a Farc-held southern airport. The group initially denied the rebel was one of theirs, but later conceded that he was. There were conflicting details about the latest kidnapping. Mr Pinto said there were only nine hostages, and that one of them was believed to be an Ecuadorean. In Washington, a state department official said that at least 10 but probably as many as 25 people were believed to have been seized, including five Americans. He said about 15 heavily armed men were thought to have been involved. At least three of the five Americans were pilots and one of them was ordered by the kidnappers to fly the captives out, said the official. Other reports said one of the victims was from New Zealand. The oilfield, operated by the Spanish energy giant, Repsol, lies in Ecuador's northern territory, which borders Colombia's southern state of Putumayo, the heart of the cocaine-producing region. AP",

In Kabul, preachers invoked a holy war at Friday prayers, while the ruling Taliban called for instant revenge. \"We strongly condemn Israel's oppressions against defenceless Palestinians and support the righteous cause of Palestine,\" a Taliban spokesman said. The leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia are expected to meet this weekend in Riyadh to prepare for a plenary Arab summit conference, due on October 21, which will draw up a collective Arab policy on the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. Their task will have been rendered all the more difficult by moves by the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, to form an emergency government that includes the rightwing extremist opposition leader General Ariel Sharon. Since General Sharon triggered the Israeli-Palestinian upheaval with his visit to the al-Aqsa compound two weeks ago, Arabs have been rallying to the Palestinian cause with a vigour not seen for years. A similar note of renewed anger was struck by Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan yesterday. About 7,000 marched through the largest of Lebanon's refugee camps, Ein el-Hilweh, condemning Thursday's \"massacre\" and calling on Egypt and Jordan to sever relations with the state of Israel. They set fire to an effigy of Mr Barak which had been daubed with the words \"specialised in murdering children\". A model of the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, suffered a similar fate.

Last week Jordan announced that it was delaying the departure of its new ambassador to Tel Aviv. The Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, who has strongly criticized two other Arab leaders, Colonel Gadafy of Libya and president Ali Abdullah Salih of Yemen, for their militant rhetoric, has shown no sign of heeding calls for ties to be cut.

      "body": "<p>It was nearly noon and the young men were engaged in a shoving match with the cordon of Israeli riot police blocking the gates of the mosque.</p> <p>Yesterday, on the third Friday since two peoples began their descent into an unholy war, it all came home to the heart of the matter: the sacred ground of the Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem.</p> <p>In the tangle of lanes around the mosque, thousands of Israeli riot police were deployed in the greatest show of force since the onset of violence. Only middle-aged men, and women, were allowed inside for afternoon prayers, and the crowds were seething with frustration.</p> <p>On the other side of Jerusalem's old walled city, meanwhile, the most sacred shrine of the Jews was almost deserted. Despite the approach of the Sukkot festival, few worshippers dared visit the Wailing Wall.</p> <p>As the hearts of two peoples returned to their faith, there could hardly have been a greater divide. One nation was angry and defiant. The other, Israel, was bracing for more horrors to come.</p> <p>In scuffles on al-Mojahedin Street, named for holy warriors, Israeli riot police used canes and forcefully applied fists to chests to turn back young men from the mosque.</p> <p>\"This is the ultimate humiliation, preventing me from going to pray,\" said Mazen Sublaba, aged 25.</p> <p>Mercifully, there was no real violence, and the massive police deployment broke the pattern of earlier Fridays when youths have stormed out of mosques throwing stones and petrol bombs.</p> <p>At Damascus Gate, one of the main entrances to the walled city, mounted policemen loomed over the crowds before driving them back with tear gas. Some men rolled out their prayer mats and knelt where they were. Others stood their ground.</p> <p>\"Saddam, Saddam, the conqueror. Go back to bombing Tel Aviv. If you want us to wear a commando uniform, we are ready,\" they screamed.</p> <p>After Yasser Arafat freed 350 militants from Palestinian jails, including the top bomber of the Hamas movement, that is precisely Israel's fear. Yesterday there was intense security around shopping malls and other public places, and the army issued warnings of a renewal of terror.</p> <p>\"We understand that they understand that they have a green light for terrorist attacks,\" said Major Yarden Vatikay, an Israeli army spokesman. \"These are people who do not plan sporadic fire.

      "bodyText": "It was nearly noon and the young men were engaged in a shoving match with the cordon of Israeli riot police blocking the gates of the mosque. Yesterday, on the third Friday since two peoples began their descent into an unholy war, it all came home to the heart of the matter: the sacred ground of the Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem. In the tangle of lanes around the mosque, thousands of Israeli riot police were deployed in the greatest show of force since the onset of violence. Only middle-aged men, and women, were allowed inside for afternoon prayers, and the crowds were seething with frustration. On the other side of Jerusalem's old walled city, meanwhile, the most sacred shrine of the Jews was almost deserted. Despite the approach of the Sukkot festival, few worshippers dared visit the Wailing Wall. As the hearts of two peoples returned to their faith, there could hardly have been a greater divide. One nation was angry and defiant. The other, Israel, was bracing for more horrors to come. In scuffles on al-Mojahedin Street, named for holy warriors, Israeli riot police used canes and forcefully applied fists to chests to turn back young men from the mosque. \"This is the ultimate humiliation, preventing me from going to pray,\" said Mazen Sublaba, aged 25. Mercifully, there was no real violence, and the massive police deployment broke the pattern of earlier Fridays when youths have stormed out of mosques throwing stones and petrol bombs. At Damascus Gate, one of the main entrances to the walled city, mounted policemen loomed over the crowds before driving them back with tear gas. Some men rolled out their prayer mats and knelt where they were. Others stood their ground. \"Saddam, Saddam, the conqueror. Go back to bombing Tel Aviv. If you want us to wear a commando uniform, we are ready,\" they screamed. After Yasser Arafat freed 350 militants from Palestinian jails, including the top bomber of the Hamas movement, that is precisely Israel's fear. Yesterday there was intense security around shopping malls and other public places, and the army issued warnings of a renewal of terror. \"We understand that they understand that they have a green light for terrorist attacks,\" said Major Yarden Vatikay, an Israeli army spokesman. \"These are people who do not plan sporadic fire. These are people who plan to demolish buildings, hit buses and kill women and children.\" In the afternoon a few dozen Israeli activists stood outside a square in west Jerusalem with placards pleading: \"Don't kill the peace\". But the streets were unusually quiet, even for the eve of the Jewish sabbath. Twenty four hours after all of Israel seems to have watched and recoiled in horror from the uncut television footage of the killing of their soldiers, a consensus seemed to be forming that peace was dead, and that the Israeli left had been fools to even think of negotiating with the Palestinians. \"The psychological and cultural split yawned open yesterday into a deep and perhaps total rift. The Palestinian people are mobilising for a war of independence, the Israeli public is united, at least at the moment, in a battle of survival,\" Ma'ariv newspaper said. In Petah Tikva, the hometown of one of the dead soldiers, they were even more unforgiving. \"It is not just this murder, but the behaviour of the Arabs inside and outside the country,\" said Dr Yehuda Finkelstein. \"This is not a peace process. this is part of a Palestinian project on how to destroy us and to throw us away from the Mediterranean area.\" In Ramallah, where worshippers went straight from afternoon prayers to throw stones at an army checkpoint on the edge of town, they agreed with the Israelis on one point, at least.

Outside the police station where the Israeli soldiers met their deaths on Thursday, a few policemen in black uniforms struggled to maintain their dignity, standing guard over what was reduced to a heap of rubble by Israel's rocket attack. Otherwise, the streets were eerily quiet. Nobody here is expressing contrition at the deaths of the soldiers. Instead their outrage is focused at Israel's deployment of its war machinery to avenge those deaths. \"This is not an intifada any more.

      "body": "<p>The west seems incapable of thinking of more than one Balkan thing at a time. But in the Balkans, it is the interconnection of things which matters. By thinking only of Croatia in 1992, we blew up Bosnia. When we ended the Bosnia war at Dayton, we forgot about Kosovo. And now there is a real danger that in the rush of relief and euphoria to welcome President Vojislav Kostunica in Serbia, we will destabilise the peace we have created in Bosnia and Kosovo and undermine the fragile government in Croatia.</p> <p>This is not to underestimate the remarkable transformation taking place in Belgrade; or the potential of the moment. It is merely to caution that there are now many ways to waste the opportunity that Mr Kostunica and the forces of democracy in Serbia have presented to us. One is for the west to judge Mr Kostunica by what he has said and done in the past. Mr Kostunica says he is a nationalist (I think he means a patriot, but there is no such distinction in Serbo-Croat). His past statements, and even some of his actions, do give cause for concern. But if it had not been so, I doubt that he would have rid us of Milosevic. So the right policy is to judge him, not by the past, but by what he does in the weeks and months ahead. And so far the things he has done have been good, even brave.</p> <p>Mr Kostunica is a legalist and has, to some, acted too slowly to rid Serbia of the malevolent forces of Milosevic. But it is a good thing to have, as president of ex-Yugoslavia, a man who is scrupulous about the law. No one should under- estimate the poison which Milosevic can infiltrate into the Serb body politic as long as he is around. But I think that the revolution that unseated him is now irreversible. If Mr Kostunica has achieved this without the lawlessness which would have resulted from more extensive use of popular force on the streets, and so strengthened the legal foundations of his government for the future, then that should be a matter for welcome, not regret.</p> <p>But if a too sceptical approach is one danger which the west should avoid, a too euphoric one is another. My hunch is that Mr Kostunica's instincts are those of cooperation and good relations with neighbours. But there is a long way to go before he establishes a stable and effective government which can put these qualities into action. Too early a western commitment of full support, before the transformation has been completed, could be dangerous. We must not relax for Serbia the standards of internal democracy and the acceptance of the rule of international law which we have demanded of other Balkan nations. The first priority should be for President Kostunica to stabilise his government. But in the end, there can be no compromise on the necessity to bring to justice in the Hague those indicted for war crimes in ex-Yugoslavia. Anything less would risk destabilising the fragile government of President Stipe Mesic in Croatia, who has taken great risks to send the Tudjman-era war criminals to the Hague.</p> <p>So the west's policy should be to offer goodwill and help for Mr Kostunica at the start, to judge him by what he now does and to be patient about progress, but firm about the conditions which must, ultimately, be fulfilled.</p> <p>What then can Mr Kostunica do to capitalise on the wider opportunities in the Balkans which his velvet revolution has created? Here the picture is mixed. There is now a real opportunity to resolve the Montenegro question which has held the Balkans on a hair-trigger for war in recent months. There seems a willingness in Belgrade to renegotiate the constitutional relationship with Montenegro, within a confederal \"commonwealth\" based on the principle of equality. This would leave all powers with the two constituent nations, except for those relating to foreign affairs, the army and the management of a single convertible currency which they hope will lead to the euro. There even seems to be agreement between the two countries to abandon the old name of Yugoslavia in favour of a new name, \"Serbia-Montenegro\" - a name whose undoubted inelegance seems a small price to pay for the removal of one of the Balkans' most explosive flash points.</p> <p>For Bosnia, too, the change in Belgrade is good news. Mr Kostunica has said (and made me promise to repeat) that he accepts the Dayton borders and wishes to establish diplomatic relations with Bosnia-Herzegovina. This should increase the votes of the moderates, at the expense of the pro-Milosevic Serbs, in the forthcoming Bosnia-wide election early next month. Freed from threats to its existence from both Croatia to its west and now Serbia to its east, Bosnia should be able to get down to the business of building itself as a state and making the changes necessary to become a candidate for Europe.</p> <p>In Kosovo the picture is more mixed. Though they will not admit it publicly, the presence of Milosevic gave legitimacy and strength to the Kosovan Albanian claim for independence. These are neuralgic times for Kosovan Albanians. They know that the removal of the dictator who so violated and brutalised their community has weakened their claim for total independence. And they fear that, just as the west's caravan moved on from Bosnia to Kosovo, now all the political will, influence and aid is about to move north to Belgrade.</p> <p>Some say that we will see played out in Kosovo the same phenomenon that I witnessed as a soldier in Belfast in 1970. The troops arrive as heroes to the oppressed, but soon become the enemy who keeps them from their political ambitions. I don't think this is likely in Kosovo. But it will need a great deal of political maturity and wisdom from Kosovo's inexperienced politicians to understand that the right response to Kostunica is not to retreat into suspicious gloominess and introspection, but to accept that Kosovo is now in an economic and democratic race with Belgrade, which they intend to win. The west will not abandon Kosovo. But we are now playing a larger game of regional reconstruction, and Kosovo will better serve itself by being part of this than by retreating into a small island of Balkan refuseniks.</p> <p>Kostunica, if he is wise, should help this process. He needs to understand that security for his fellow Serbs in Kosovo does not come out of the barrel of a K-For gun, but out of a new political relationship between the two communities, which, on the Serb side, he can help lead from Belgrade. No doubt his own nationalist elements will want him to strike muscular positions on Kosovo. That would set the province alight, cause even more suffering to the Serbs, increase the votes of the Albanian extremists in next week's Kosovo elections and make sure that K-For troops have to stay longer. His best course of action is to say he wants to work constructively with the UN in Kosovo, advise Kosovan Serbs to do the same and leave the status of Kosovo to later when things have quietened down.</p> <p>One final step we should now consider. The end of Milosevic has left a number of interconnected southern Balkan issues still to be resolved: the status of Kosovo, the relationship between Montenegro and Serbia, the stability of Macedonia and, now that we have removed the danger of a greater Serbia, the question of a greater Albania. There is now a case for looking at these regionally - for a kind of \"southern Balkans Dayton\". As I said, in the Balkans it is the interconnection of things which matters.</p> <p>Paddy Ashdown's diaries, which include previous trips to the Balkans, will be published on November 1</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Mr Kostunica says he is a nationalist (I think he means a patriot, but there is no such distinction in Serbo-Croat). His past statements, and even some of his actions, do give cause for concern. But if it had not been so, I doubt that he would have rid us of Milosevic. So the right policy is to judge him, not by the past, but by what he does in the weeks and months ahead. And so far the things he has done have been good, even brave. Mr Kostunica is a legalist and has, to some, acted too slowly to rid Serbia of the malevolent forces of Milosevic. But it is a good thing to have, as president of ex-Yugoslavia, a man who is scrupulous about the law. No one should under- estimate the poison which Milosevic can infiltrate into the Serb body politic as long as he is around. But I think that the revolution that unseated him is now irreversible. If Mr Kostunica has achieved this without the lawlessness which would have resulted from more extensive use of popular force on the streets, and so strengthened the legal foundations of his government for the future, then that should be a matter for welcome, not regret. But if a too sceptical approach is one danger which the west should avoid, a too euphoric one is another. My hunch is that Mr Kostunica's instincts are those of cooperation and good relations with neighbours. But there is a long way to go before he establishes a stable and effective government which can put these qualities into action. Too early a western commitment of full support, before the transformation has been completed, could be dangerous. We must not relax for Serbia the standards of internal democracy and the acceptance of the rule of international law which we have demanded of other Balkan nations. The first priority should be for President Kostunica to stabilise his government. But in the end, there can be no compromise on the necessity to bring to justice in the Hague those indicted for war crimes in ex-Yugoslavia. Anything less would risk destabilising the fragile government of President Stipe Mesic in Croatia, who has taken great risks to send the Tudjman-era war criminals to the Hague. So the west's policy should be to offer goodwill and help for Mr Kostunica at the start, to judge him by what he now does and to be patient about progress, but firm about the conditions which must, ultimately, be fulfilled. What then can Mr Kostunica do to capitalise on the wider opportunities in the Balkans which his velvet revolution has created? Here the picture is mixed. There is now a real opportunity to resolve the Montenegro question which has held the Balkans on a hair-trigger for war in recent months. There seems a willingness in Belgrade to renegotiate the constitutional relationship with Montenegro, within a confederal \"commonwealth\" based on the principle of equality. This would leave all powers with the two constituent nations, except for those relating to foreign affairs, the army and the management of a single convertible currency which they hope will lead to the euro. There even seems to be agreement between the two countries to abandon the old name of Yugoslavia in favour of a new name, \"Serbia-Montenegro\" - a name whose undoubted inelegance seems a small price to pay for the removal of one of the Balkans' most explosive flash points. For Bosnia, too, the change in Belgrade is good news. Mr Kostunica has said (and made me promise to repeat) that he accepts the Dayton borders and wishes to establish diplomatic relations with Bosnia-Herzegovina. This should increase the votes of the moderates, at the expense of the pro-Milosevic Serbs, in the forthcoming Bosnia-wide election early next month. Freed from threats to its existence from both Croatia to its west and now Serbia to its east, Bosnia should be able to get down to the business of building itself as a state and making the changes necessary to become a candidate for Europe. In Kosovo the picture is more mixed. Though they will not admit it publicly, the presence of Milosevic gave legitimacy and strength to the Kosovan Albanian claim for independence. These are neuralgic times for Kosovan Albanians. They know that the removal of the dictator who so violated and brutalised their community has weakened their claim for total independence. And they fear that, just as the west's caravan moved on from Bosnia to Kosovo, now all the political will, influence and aid is about to move north to Belgrade. Some say that we will see played out in Kosovo the same phenomenon that I witnessed as a soldier in Belfast in 1970. The troops arrive as heroes to the oppressed, but soon become the enemy who keeps them from their political ambitions. I don't think this is likely in Kosovo. But it will need a great deal of political maturity and wisdom from Kosovo's inexperienced politicians to understand that the right response to Kostunica is not to retreat into suspicious gloominess and introspection, but to accept that Kosovo is now in an economic and democratic race with Belgrade, which they intend to win. The west will not abandon Kosovo. But we are now playing a larger game of regional reconstruction, and Kosovo will better serve itself by being part of this than by retreating into a small island of Balkan refuseniks. Kostunica, if he is wise, should help this process. He needs to understand that security for his fellow Serbs in Kosovo does not come out of the barrel of a K-For gun, but out of a new political relationship between the two communities, which, on the Serb side, he can help lead from Belgrade. No doubt his own nationalist elements will want him to strike muscular positions on Kosovo. That would set the province alight, cause even more suffering to the Serbs, increase the votes of the Albanian extremists in next week's Kosovo elections and make sure that K-For troops have to stay longer. His best course of action is to say he wants to work constructively with the UN in Kosovo, advise Kosovan Serbs to do the same and leave the status of Kosovo to later when things have quietened down. One final step we should now consider. The end of Milosevic has left a number of interconnected southern Balkan issues still to be resolved: the status of Kosovo, the relationship between Montenegro and Serbia, the stability of Macedonia and, now that we have removed the danger of a greater Serbia, the question of a greater Albania. There is now a case for looking at these regionally - for a kind of \"southern Balkans Dayton\". As I said, in the Balkans it is the interconnection of things which matters.

Graeme Bloch's reply (I cannot recognise the picture you paint, G2, October 13) spoke eloquently for many of us who went through worse punishments under the old apartheid regime than merely having our words banned, and made, with categorical examples, the case that the new democratic South Africa is in fact gloriously different from the old in its entire approach to dissidence. To suggest otherwise on the basis of such marginal criticisms as were made, compared with the days when critics were arrested, prosecuted, banned, exiled, banished and murdered, is to insult the great achievements of those South African heroes who have achieved such a great transformation of what was deservedly such a pariah state.

      "bodyText": "George W Bush has recovered his lead in the American presidential election opinion polls in part because more voters have come to see Al Gore as a traditional liberal advocate of big government, advisers to both White House candidates believe. Republican strategists urged Mr Bush to put the \"big government\" issue at the centre of his case against Mr Gore during the second presidential debate earlier this week in North Carolina. Mr Bush, as usual, carried out his advisers' wishes to the full. President Clinton is believed to be among the Democratic moderates who counselled Mr Gore to place more emphasis on the government's role as a promoter of opportunity rather than as a provider of solutions, an approach that Mr Gore tried to follow with limited success in the debate. While recent US campaign headlines have focused on aspects of the candidates' characters, Mr Bush's current surge has been accompanied by the emergence of strong public support for a smaller and less activist government than Mr Gore proposes. Results of a Washington Post survey of public opinion this week showed that Americans prefer a less interventionist government by a margin of nearly two to one, a finding which could make it very hard for Mr Gore to capture centre-ground voters, who are particularly sceptical about government activism. According to the Post poll, 58% of voters say that they would favour \"smaller government with fewer services\", as against 32% of Americans who prefer \"larger government with many services\". When asked which of the two candidates would do a better job \"holding down the size of government\", 54% chose Mr Bush, while only 33% chose Mr Gore. Mr Gore's dilemma is that almost all of the individual programmes he supports are very popular; he revived his flagging candidacy this summer by pledging to use government spending to help \"working families\" and the poor. Yet, as the election nears, those promises seem not to hold such attraction for the affluent minority of Americans who are expected to vote on November 7. \"Gore's reliance on government solutions has been very successful in rallying the Democratic base, but it does not play well with the independent voters whose support he also now needs,\" a leading Democratic moderate said this week. Mr Bush, who has placed a $1,300bn (\u00a3885bn) tax cut over 10 years at the centre of his programme, relentlessly painted Mr Gore as a supporter of big government during their debate. \"I don't believe, like the vice-president does, in huge government,\" Mr Bush said Wednesday during his closing remarks.\"I believe in limited government. And by having a limited government and a focused government we can send some of the money back to the people that pay the bills.\" On several occasions during the debate, Mr Gore tried to stress his credentials as a limited-government man. \"I'm for shrinking the size of government. I want a smaller and smarter government,\" he said. \"I'm not for command and control techniques,\" he said later in the debate. At times, however, Mr Gore also seemed an enthusiast for government intervention at home and abroad; responding to Mr Bush's calls for limited US foreign engagement, Mr Gore said that the US should \"provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction\". And when he talked about subjects such as healthcare, hate crimes and education, Mr Gore seemed to embrace government activism very willingly. In 1992 and 1996, Mr Clinton successfully finessed the issue with his \"third way\" strategy, in which he reinvented the Democrats as the party of more limited government activism. Mr Gore has not been able to follow through on that approach in the way that hardcore moderates - such as his running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, and President Clinton - would normally favour. As he saw his support languishing throughout the first half of this year, Mr Gore was compelled to move to the left, trying to inspire traditional Democratic voters with promises of big spending programmes - especially on pensions and prescription drug benefits for the elderly - made possible by the surplus in the federal budget. That strategy restored Mr Gore's candidacy to health in August and for much of September. But in the past three weeks the vice-president has lost ground as Mr Bush regained it with promises of tax cuts. Win or lose, the issue is certain to be at the heart of the election post-mortems after November 7.",

      "bodyText": "Amos Oz (Why Arafat must take the blame, October 13) attacks Arafat and pleads for a Palestinian right to nationhood and sovereignty. Mr Oz's tone is temperate and rational. This contrasts with Edward Said's article (Double standards, October 12), which makes a similar demand for Palestinian rights, but uses the language of anger and hate. Mr Said calls Ariel Sharon a \"paunchy old war criminal\", Yasser Arafat \"an ageing and discredited leader\" of a \"corrupt and stupidly oppressive regime\", and Hosni Mubarak an \"isolated and unpopular Arab chief... compelled humiliatingly to toe the American line\". When a respected academic such as Mr Said resorts to inflammatory vilification, attacking people because they are overweight and old, he discredits his own argument, and lets down the Palestinians, for whom he has acted as a spokesperson. He certainly would not make it easy for Mr Oz to persuade his fellow Israelis to put away their guns and begin delicate negotiations.

Two people - a man in his 30s and a woman in her 60s -were detained on Thursday morning at addresses in London and West Yorkshire. The pair were bailed to return to a London police station in February. A man in his 30s and a woman in her 20s were arrested by Merseyside police in the Wavertree district of Liverpool on Thursday afternoon. They will be taken to a London police station \"in due course\", a spokesman at Scotland Yard said. A number of addresses have been searched during the operation by officers from the Metropolitan police fraud squad's public sector team in London, and a \"quantity of material has been removed\", the spokesman said. But a spokeswoman for the New Millennium Experience Company, which operates the dome, said the attraction itself, on the bank of the Thames in south-east London, was not searched. A company spokesman said: \"It is a matter for the police and the courts. That is all we can say at the moment.\" Details of the fraud squad's investigation of the \"inappropriate\" contract first emerged almost a month ago. The allegations were brought to the attention of fraud squad officers by the dome's operators, who spotted the alleged irregularity during an internal audit. A company spokesman said in September that the con tractor in question was responsible for services within the dome building itself rather than the actual structure or the attractions. The fraud squad inquiry centres on an allegation of illegal procurement of a contract by a firm working for the NMEC. The claims of irregularities are believed to be related to an alleged failure, involving a south-east London firm, to follow guidelines.",

      "body": "<p>A devastating, blow by blow account that leaves few people connected with the \u00a31bn Millennium Dome fiasco unscathed will be revealed by parliament's financial watchdog, the national audit office, next month.</p> <p>The report describes how the misconceived project - already over budget before it opened - applied for four separate tranches of cash this year, totalling \u00a3179m, to avoid bankruptcy.</p> <p>The report records a story of how directors and senior staff of the New Millennium Experience Company lost control of the dome's finances, accepted without question over optimistic visitor projections, and had no clue of who owned what and how many contracts they had let.</p> <p>The only way disaster could have been avoided was if the dome had never been opened in the first place.</p> <p>The one year contracts signed before the end of last year were based on 12m visitors including 1m guests coming to the dome.</p> <p>The dramatic failure to predict accurately the correct number of visitors is the main reason the auditors give for the financial catastrophe that followed.</p> <p>The national audit office predicts that the final figure for visitors will be 4.5m, including cut price tickets and 1m guests.</p> <p>As a result of the shortfall in visitors, money was haemorrhaging from the dome each month, the report points out.</p> <p>The auditors blame the original directors of the company, who include Michael Grade, Channel 4's former chief executive, Sir Brian Jenkins, chairman of the Woolwich Bank, and Bob Ayling, former chief executive of British Airways, for not taking a grip on the project.</p> <p>They also reveal that the nine millennium commissioners initially failed to question the visitor projections until things started going wrong.</p> <p>The first alarm bell rang when the dome company took up a \u00a350m tranche held in reserve.</p> <p>The second came in February - only two months after the dome had opened - when the company won a \"final\" \u00a360m to tide it over.</p> <p>The money was handed over only after the millennium commission sent its own finance officers into the com pany to check the facts. They came back saying the cash was essential. The dome immediately gobbled up \u00a330m to stave off debts - and then drew on the remaining \u00a330m over the next two months.</p> <p>By May there was a demand for another \u00a338.4m. This time the commission's director, Mike O' Connor, refused to sign the cheque.</p> <p>Accountants Deloitte and Touche had already been sent in to the dome, and uncovered more financial disasters.</p> <p>But Chris Smith, the culture secretary, and the nine commissioners agreed to give the dome another \u00a329m.</p> <p>Then in August the dome company demanded another \u00a343m as part of the deal to sell it as an going concern to the Japanese company, Nomura, at the end of the year. The money was granted on the grounds it would be returned after Nomura paid \u00a3105m to take over the dome. Then came the devastating report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accountantcy firm, revealing the dome was technically insolvent and could not meet its bills.</p> <p>Nomura pulled out and the company's letter -put in the House of Lords library by the government - lists a catalogue of failings, all covered in the auditors' report.</p> <p>The final blow came last month when the commissioners had to overrule its own director for the second time in four months, after he refused to pay out another \u00a347m to keep the dome afloat and provide for the \"winding up\" process. Once again the money had to be paid by diktat.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A devastating, blow by blow account that leaves few people connected with the \u00a31bn Millennium Dome fiasco unscathed will be revealed by parliament's financial watchdog, the national audit office, next month. The report describes how the misconceived project - already over budget before it opened - applied for four separate tranches of cash this year, totalling \u00a3179m, to avoid bankruptcy. The report records a story of how directors and senior staff of the New Millennium Experience Company lost control of the dome's finances, accepted without question over optimistic visitor projections, and had no clue of who owned what and how many contracts they had let. The only way disaster could have been avoided was if the dome had never been opened in the first place. The one year contracts signed before the end of last year were based on 12m visitors including 1m guests coming to the dome. The dramatic failure to predict accurately the correct number of visitors is the main reason the auditors give for the financial catastrophe that followed. The national audit office predicts that the final figure for visitors will be 4.5m, including cut price tickets and 1m guests. As a result of the shortfall in visitors, money was haemorrhaging from the dome each month, the report points out. The auditors blame the original directors of the company, who include Michael Grade, Channel 4's former chief executive, Sir Brian Jenkins, chairman of the Woolwich Bank, and Bob Ayling, former chief executive of British Airways, for not taking a grip on the project. They also reveal that the nine millennium commissioners initially failed to question the visitor projections until things started going wrong. The first alarm bell rang when the dome company took up a \u00a350m tranche held in reserve. The second came in February - only two months after the dome had opened - when the company won a \"final\" \u00a360m to tide it over. The money was handed over only after the millennium commission sent its own finance officers into the com pany to check the facts. They came back saying the cash was essential. The dome immediately gobbled up \u00a330m to stave off debts - and then drew on the remaining \u00a330m over the next two months. By May there was a demand for another \u00a338.4m. This time the commission's director, Mike O' Connor, refused to sign the cheque. Accountants Deloitte and Touche had already been sent in to the dome, and uncovered more financial disasters. But Chris Smith, the culture secretary, and the nine commissioners agreed to give the dome another \u00a329m. Then in August the dome company demanded another \u00a343m as part of the deal to sell it as an going concern to the Japanese company, Nomura, at the end of the year. The money was granted on the grounds it would be returned after Nomura paid \u00a3105m to take over the dome. Then came the devastating report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accountantcy firm, revealing the dome was technically insolvent and could not meet its bills. Nomura pulled out and the company's letter -put in the House of Lords library by the government - lists a catalogue of failings, all covered in the auditors' report. The final blow came last month when the commissioners had to overrule its own director for the second time in four months, after he refused to pay out another \u00a347m to keep the dome afloat and provide for the \"winding up\" process. Once again the money had to be paid by diktat.",

To this day, alcoholism is one of the main problems on the reservations. Now a fight is brewing over a historic decision by one tribe to ban alcohol sales on its reservation, a decision being challenged in the courts by the state's attorney general. The Yakama tribe in Toppenish, Washington state, has been deeply affected like almost every other tribe by alcoholism among its members. Three weeks ago, it decided to ban the sale of alcohol at the stores and taverns on its 2,000 sq mile ( 5,000 sq km) reservation: possibly the first time a \"wet\" reserve has voted to go dry. But the ban has prompted protests from some among the 20,000 non-Indians living in the three small towns on the reservation; they want to continue buying alcohol there. The dispute highlights the Indians' struggle to deal with the debilitating effects of alcohol - and the issue of just how much power they can wield inside what are supposedly autonomous areas. The attorney general of Washington state, Christine Gregoire, plans to sue the Yakama for trying to impose a local law that they have no authority to enforce. The Yakama claim that under the federal laws of the 1830s, intoxicants should not be sold on Indian land.

Last night the same judge ruled that Hoover may not sell or manufacture any more of its Triple Vortex cleaners within the UK with immediate effect.

      "body": "<p>Four miles or so from Reading station - just go left at the Pack Saddle pub and follow the signs - lies Cross Lanes Fruit Farm (0118 9723167; email, <a href=\"mailto:apples@crosslanesfruitfarm.co.uk\">apples@crosslanesfruitfarm.co.uk</a>), all 25 acres of it filled with 60 varieties of fruit: pears, apples, quince, plums and damsons, available from late August until Christmas. Gill Franklin is standing in her driveway, looking like a sprightly girl with her silvery hair and astonishingly blue eyes. It barely seems possible that she has two grown-up children.</p> <p>We sit in the kitchen, drinking tea; a pair of black, furry bear slippers has been kicked off in a corner, a bowl of eight pears sits in the middle of the table. Intermittently, Gill leaps up to see to customers, speak to her husband, her son or the gas man. Each time, she climbs into a pair of wellington boots and trots outside. The thin stripe around each leg of her jeans shows where the tops of the wellies have rubbed them pale.</p> <p>Gill and her husband, Dennis, left London in 1977, substituting the bustle of city life for the hedgerows of Mapledurham. At the time, it was a place where you couldn't buy a red pepper for love nor money, and the restaurants shut on a Tuesday night. Friends thought they were barmy. But the Franklins had a plan: they were hoping to start a family, and also wanted some land that would be an investment. They considered an art gallery and a fishery before deciding on the orchard.</p> <p>Being novices to the fruit-growing business, they relied at the beginning on two local women who had worked on the farm under its previous owner. Back then, the ministry of agriculture doled out advice free of charge, which was a huge help in the early days. They still get the ministry's weekly notes, though they now have to pay for them.</p> <p>And that's not the only change: 23 years ago, the district boasted many independent, family-run fruit farms and shops; now, there are virtually none. That's a waste, says Gill, as the land around the Chilterns is ideal for fruit - it's clay patches on top of chalk, she explains, which gives the fruit the water it needs. The rise of the supermarket put paid to all that, while the success of the Le Crunch Bunch ad campaign for Golden Delicious (\"They should have been prosecuted under the trade descriptions act. They're not delicious at all.\") sounded the death-knell for many British varieties.</p> <p>As a result, the Franklins decided to specialise more, to bring in damsons and medlars, and to revel in their fruit's seasonality. This may well be the only way to compete with the big chains, but it requires constant work, 365 days a year, planting and grafting and pruning, not to mention lugging 15lb picking-bags and 52lb bushels during the harvesting months. There is no end to it, but \"every little bit more you do improves things for next year,\" says Gill.</p> <p>Gill is not just a grower, however; she's an aficionado. She eats eight to 10 apples a day, a different variety for different times of day. In the morning, she'll have something robust, a James Grieve or a Russet. Come teatime, she'll choose something more aromatic: a Spartan, say. Her favourite, though, is the Egremont Russet, that mottled, almost-pear of an apple. As for pears, she likes Beurr\u008e Hardys the best, for their smooth flesh and scented flavour.</p> <p>She shows me the pears in the bowl on the kitchen table - the Comice, the Concorde, the Conference (named after the 1885 National British Pear Conference), the pretty little Glou Morceau, the Beth, the Williams, the Packham's Triumph and the Onward - and says that they grow their pears on quince roots, to keep the trees small. It makes the fruit easier to pick, she explains, and also means that the sun can reach all of the branches.</p> <p>The Comice, which is increasingly popular, faintly blushes with soft, creamy flesh, and is famed for being very sweet and juicy. This juiciness may make it inappropriate for cooking, but it's the perfect partner for cheese. Slurpiness in a pear has never been a bad thing: in The Anatomy Of Dessert, Edward Bunyard wrote, \"It is, in my view, the duty of an apple to be crisp and crunchable, but a pear should have such a texture as leads to silent consumption.\" This is one reason why the Franklins hand out slips of paper with their pears, explaining how to tell when the fruit is ripe and how to store it.</p> <p>Next, it's on to a tour of the orchard. First stop is the quince, which stands alone, a beautiful, plump tree, its fruit hanging heavy and golden among rather sad-looking leaves. It used to grow in a friend's garden, says, Gill, but three years ago they dug it up and transported it to Cross Lanes in the back of the car. Despite the rough treatment, it has thrived. The blossom is the size of a 20p piece, explains Gill, and white with a pink inside - like water lilies, she says. The fruit comes in two varieties: the perfumed, which is shaped like a mini football, and the pineapple, which resembles a pear - the Franklins grow the latter.</p> <p>Quince may have fallen from favour somewhat - when was the last time you saw it in your local hypermarket - but not for nothing was it the original fruit used in marmalades (indeed, the Portuguese call it \"marmelo\"). And this is still the best way to use this marvellous fruit - in jams, jellies, marmalades and syrups.</p> <p>Then it's to the barn, in which are piled boxes of apples and pears. The air here is heavy with the scent of autumn fruit, all honeyish, sweet and musty; it's the kind of smell you crave when you've been too long in the city. Gill slices off some pear for me to try. It is delicious and nutty, tasting, somehow, of the last flicker of summer. All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b>Quince jelly</b><br> One of my all-time favourite things. This recipe is from Mrs CF Leyel, a long-standing reference. Sorry to all you decimal lovers out there, but with jelly and jam I still work in pints and pounds. It just comes out better that way.</p> <p>Ripe quinces<br> Water <br> Sugar</p> <p>Pare and core the quinces, cut them up, weigh them and pop into a pot. Pour in a pint of water to each pound of fruit, and bring to a simmer: be careful here, as if you cook them too long the colour changes to red; you want it to remain quite pale. Strain through a jelly bag and set aside. The next day, weigh out the juice, put it into a preserving pan and boil for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in 12 ounces of sugar for each pound of juice. Boil for 15-20 minutes, until cooked, stirring all the time and removing any scum that rises to the surface. Bottle in scrupulously cleaned, dried and warmed jars.</p> <p><b>Quails with Quince </b><br> An idea of Jane Grigson's that is a curious delight. It also works well with pheasant or guinea fowl.</p> <p>2 large, ripe quinces <br> 12 quail <br> 6 tbsp Calvados <br> 225g quince jelly (recipe above, or buy membrillo - quince cheese - from a good deli)<br> Butter <br> 100ml well-flavoured stock <br> Salt and pepper</p> <p>Wipe any fluff off the quinces, then peel, core and thinly slice the fruit. Place in a single layer on the base of a suitably-sized pot, and pop the quails on top. Pour over the Calvados, seal the pot with clingfilm and a lid, and refrigerate for a couple of days. Remove the quails from the pot, and keep refrigerated. Transfer the fruit to another pot, cover with enough water to come halfway up the sides of the pot, and add the jelly. Simmer gently until the quince becomes very tender.</p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6. Butter an earthenware dish and lay half the cooked quince inside. Butter the birds and place atop the fruit. Pour over any juice remaining in the the original pot. Lightly salt and pepper the birds, then cook in the oven for 15-20 minutes, basting once or twice. Put the birds to one side to rest in a warm spot, add the stock to the roasting dish, and return to the hot oven for a further 10 minutes.</p> <p>If the quince is still too liquid, then simply carry on cooking in the oven until reduced sufficiently.

      "bodyText": "Four miles or so from Reading station - just go left at the Pack Saddle pub and follow the signs - lies Cross Lanes Fruit Farm (0118 9723167; email, apples@crosslanesfruitfarm.co.uk), all 25 acres of it filled with 60 varieties of fruit: pears, apples, quince, plums and damsons, available from late August until Christmas. Gill Franklin is standing in her driveway, looking like a sprightly girl with her silvery hair and astonishingly blue eyes. It barely seems possible that she has two grown-up children. We sit in the kitchen, drinking tea; a pair of black, furry bear slippers has been kicked off in a corner, a bowl of eight pears sits in the middle of the table. Intermittently, Gill leaps up to see to customers, speak to her husband, her son or the gas man. Each time, she climbs into a pair of wellington boots and trots outside. The thin stripe around each leg of her jeans shows where the tops of the wellies have rubbed them pale. Gill and her husband, Dennis, left London in 1977, substituting the bustle of city life for the hedgerows of Mapledurham. At the time, it was a place where you couldn't buy a red pepper for love nor money, and the restaurants shut on a Tuesday night. Friends thought they were barmy. But the Franklins had a plan: they were hoping to start a family, and also wanted some land that would be an investment. They considered an art gallery and a fishery before deciding on the orchard. Being novices to the fruit-growing business, they relied at the beginning on two local women who had worked on the farm under its previous owner. Back then, the ministry of agriculture doled out advice free of charge, which was a huge help in the early days. They still get the ministry's weekly notes, though they now have to pay for them. And that's not the only change: 23 years ago, the district boasted many independent, family-run fruit farms and shops; now, there are virtually none. That's a waste, says Gill, as the land around the Chilterns is ideal for fruit - it's clay patches on top of chalk, she explains, which gives the fruit the water it needs. The rise of the supermarket put paid to all that, while the success of the Le Crunch Bunch ad campaign for Golden Delicious (\"They should have been prosecuted under the trade descriptions act. They're not delicious at all.\") sounded the death-knell for many British varieties. As a result, the Franklins decided to specialise more, to bring in damsons and medlars, and to revel in their fruit's seasonality. This may well be the only way to compete with the big chains, but it requires constant work, 365 days a year, planting and grafting and pruning, not to mention lugging 15lb picking-bags and 52lb bushels during the harvesting months. There is no end to it, but \"every little bit more you do improves things for next year,\" says Gill. Gill is not just a grower, however; she's an aficionado. She eats eight to 10 apples a day, a different variety for different times of day. In the morning, she'll have something robust, a James Grieve or a Russet. Come teatime, she'll choose something more aromatic: a Spartan, say. Her favourite, though, is the Egremont Russet, that mottled, almost-pear of an apple. As for pears, she likes Beurr\u008e Hardys the best, for their smooth flesh and scented flavour. She shows me the pears in the bowl on the kitchen table - the Comice, the Concorde, the Conference (named after the 1885 National British Pear Conference), the pretty little Glou Morceau, the Beth, the Williams, the Packham's Triumph and the Onward - and says that they grow their pears on quince roots, to keep the trees small. It makes the fruit easier to pick, she explains, and also means that the sun can reach all of the branches. The Comice, which is increasingly popular, faintly blushes with soft, creamy flesh, and is famed for being very sweet and juicy. This juiciness may make it inappropriate for cooking, but it's the perfect partner for cheese. Slurpiness in a pear has never been a bad thing: in The Anatomy Of Dessert, Edward Bunyard wrote, \"It is, in my view, the duty of an apple to be crisp and crunchable, but a pear should have such a texture as leads to silent consumption.\" This is one reason why the Franklins hand out slips of paper with their pears, explaining how to tell when the fruit is ripe and how to store it. Next, it's on to a tour of the orchard. First stop is the quince, which stands alone, a beautiful, plump tree, its fruit hanging heavy and golden among rather sad-looking leaves. It used to grow in a friend's garden, says, Gill, but three years ago they dug it up and transported it to Cross Lanes in the back of the car. Despite the rough treatment, it has thrived. The blossom is the size of a 20p piece, explains Gill, and white with a pink inside - like water lilies, she says. The fruit comes in two varieties: the perfumed, which is shaped like a mini football, and the pineapple, which resembles a pear - the Franklins grow the latter. Quince may have fallen from favour somewhat - when was the last time you saw it in your local hypermarket - but not for nothing was it the original fruit used in marmalades (indeed, the Portuguese call it \"marmelo\"). And this is still the best way to use this marvellous fruit - in jams, jellies, marmalades and syrups. Then it's to the barn, in which are piled boxes of apples and pears. The air here is heavy with the scent of autumn fruit, all honeyish, sweet and musty; it's the kind of smell you crave when you've been too long in the city. Gill slices off some pear for me to try. It is delicious and nutty, tasting, somehow, of the last flicker of summer. All recipes serve six. Quince jelly One of my all-time favourite things. This recipe is from Mrs CF Leyel, a long-standing reference. Sorry to all you decimal lovers out there, but with jelly and jam I still work in pints and pounds. It just comes out better that way. Ripe quinces Water Sugar Pare and core the quinces, cut them up, weigh them and pop into a pot. Pour in a pint of water to each pound of fruit, and bring to a simmer: be careful here, as if you cook them too long the colour changes to red; you want it to remain quite pale. Strain through a jelly bag and set aside. The next day, weigh out the juice, put it into a preserving pan and boil for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in 12 ounces of sugar for each pound of juice. Boil for 15-20 minutes, until cooked, stirring all the time and removing any scum that rises to the surface. Bottle in scrupulously cleaned, dried and warmed jars. Quails with Quince An idea of Jane Grigson's that is a curious delight. It also works well with pheasant or guinea fowl. 2 large, ripe quinces 12 quail 6 tbsp Calvados 225g quince jelly (recipe above, or buy membrillo - quince cheese - from a good deli) Butter 100ml well-flavoured stock Salt and pepper Wipe any fluff off the quinces, then peel, core and thinly slice the fruit. Place in a single layer on the base of a suitably-sized pot, and pop the quails on top. Pour over the Calvados, seal the pot with clingfilm and a lid, and refrigerate for a couple of days. Remove the quails from the pot, and keep refrigerated. Transfer the fruit to another pot, cover with enough water to come halfway up the sides of the pot, and add the jelly. Simmer gently until the quince becomes very tender. Pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6. Butter an earthenware dish and lay half the cooked quince inside. Butter the birds and place atop the fruit. Pour over any juice remaining in the the original pot. Lightly salt and pepper the birds, then cook in the oven for 15-20 minutes, basting once or twice. Put the birds to one side to rest in a warm spot, add the stock to the roasting dish, and return to the hot oven for a further 10 minutes. If the quince is still too liquid, then simply carry on cooking in the oven until reduced sufficiently. Return the quails to the dish and transfer to the table. Serve with roast or boiled potatoes, and a salad of bitter leaves. Pears with ricotta and almonds 100ml white wine 210ml water 220g caster sugar 1 vanilla pod 1 bayleaf 6 Williams pears The juice of 1 lemon 120g best-quality ricotta 6 dssp delicate honey 30g flaked almonds, roasted golden-brown Put the wine, water, sugar, vanilla pod and bayleaf in a big pot. Make a disc out of greaseproof paper that is slightly larger than the pot, and keep to one side. Bring the contents of the pot to a boil and simmer for five minutes or so. Peel the pears and cut them in half lengthways. Toss in lemon juice, to prevent discolouring, then remove the core. Slip the pears into the simmering syrup and bring the pot to a boil for 30 seconds or so. Turn down to a simmer, cover with the disc of paper and then a plate, and cook for 20-25 minutes, until they offer no resistance to a knife. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Place two halves of pear on each serving plate. Divide the ricotta between the pears, then spoon over the honey and a liberal sprinkling of flaked almonds. Add a couple of spoonfuls of syrup to the plate, and the dish is done. Normandy Tart For the pastry 130g unsalted butter 250g plain flour, sifted 1 tbsp icing sugar, sifted 1 egg 1 egg yolk 1 pinch salt For the filling 500g good Williams pears Lemon juice 50g sugar \u00ba tsp ground cinnamon For the cream 1 egg 60g caster sugar 30g plain flour 145ml double cream 3 tbsp Calvados Icing sugar, for dusting Place the butter, flour and icing sugar in a bowl and manipulate with your fingers until the mixture is the texture of fine crumbs.

At Thresher wine shops (and Oddbins also), there is the invigorating Dashwood Sauvignon Blanc 1999 (16 points, \u00a36.99), from New Zealand, which parades ripe gooseberries, lemon and a faraway echo of ogen melon, all beautifully textured. At Wine Rack and Bottoms Up, there are two stunning 17-point Italian reds: Valpolicella Ripassa Superiore Zenato 1997 (\u00a37.99) and Amarone della Valpolicella Zenato 1995 (\u00a317.99). </p> <p>The first shows the seemingly casual brilliance of Zenato's winemaking, where effortlessly integrated fruit and acid with textured, delicately tannined complexity deliciously combine.

Picajuan Peak Bonarda 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a33.79), from Argentina, has a wonderful rich and invigorating jammy richness that manages to stay dry and characterful. Picajuan Peak Sangiovese 1998 (16 points, \u00a33.79) is rivetingly fruity, well-organised and engaging, exhibiting savoury touches to the tannins, firm touches of plum and blackcurrant to the dry fruit.

Picajuan Peak Bonarda 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a33.79), from Argentina, has a wonderful rich and invigorating jammy richness that manages to stay dry and characterful. Picajuan Peak Sangiovese 1998 (16 points, \u00a33.79) is rivetingly fruity, well-organised and engaging, exhibiting savoury touches to the tannins, firm touches of plum and blackcurrant to the dry fruit. It is certainly a contender for the \u00a33.80-and-under Wine of the Year. Montana Reserve Merlot 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a38.99, also at Thresher and Victoria Wine), from New Zealand, is a stylish conglomerate of opulent fruit with gorgeous woody undertones - the fruit, though, is firmly in command. This wine has a fine texture, providing a tightly woven finish of substance and stylish moreishness. Mr Hands should try it. He patently likes bargains, even when they cost.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On Saturday night, Johnny's Recovery Room, a down-at-heel bar on Harlem's main drag, had been marinating in Motown and malt whisky. A woman who had been staring into space for at least half an hour had fallen off her perch on a bar stool only minutes after Gloria Gaynor had finished I Will Survive. She landed with a thud, remained there for a short while before being picked up and offered another drink. Minutes later an equally drunk man had danced out to Midnight Train To Georgia and cheers from the bar. </p> <p>But now, on 125th Street in the cold light of Sunday morning, the last partygoers are outnumbered by churchgoers. Saints and sinners pass each other as though in different worlds. The faithful, suited, booted and ready to pray, walk purposefully clutching Bibles in small suitcases, while the feckless, in last night's gladrags, sit on stoops holding cans of beer and bottles of whiskey in brown paper bags, watching the coaches go by. </p> <p>Large, plush, air conditioned vehicles are cruising Upper Manhattan with eager cargoes of tourists. Japanese, Germans, Koreans, British and even some Americans are now regular features in Harlem's Sunday landscape and cast a curious, slightly nervous, eye over the drunks who cast an ambivalent, slightly mocking, eye back. Later the tourists head for one of a select group of churches - to watch rather than worship - and then on to Sylvia's for soul food and a story to tell the folks back home. </p> <p>\"Harlem wears to the casual observer a casual face,\" wrote James Baldwin, who was born there. \"No one remarks that - considering the history of black men and women and the legends that have sprung up about them, to say nothing of the ever-present policemen, wary on the street corners - the face is, indeed, somewhat excessively casual and may not be as open or as careless as it seems.\" </p> <p>His essay, Harlem Ghetto, was written in 1948 but is as pertinent now as it has ever been. For surrounding the church-day nonchalance are signs of fundamental change. Some, like the Gap billboard, the Starbucks coffee shop and the scaffolding around the Abyssinian Baptist church are comparatively subtle. Others, like the Harlem USA shopping mall, the new buildings and the huge HMV store, are not. All are indications of the economic development pouring into the area over the past five years, a combination of government money and corporate investment that is changing the texture of life here not just commercially but culturally. </p> <p>To some this marks the second Harlem renaissance, mirroring the area's heyday early in the last century, when it was home to a new wave of African-American literature, art and music that exuded confidence and originality. It presents another opportunity to emerge from a public perception of urban decay and deprivation. \"We are only minutes away from some of the most expensive real estate in the world, yet there are still buildings in Harlem that remain vacant,\" says Darren Walker, chief operating officer of the Abyssinian Development Corporation, a non-profit organisation, affiliated to Harlem's biggest church. \"Rebuilding and filling them makes us a more attractive neighbourhood.\" To others the change represents a threat to spiritual integrity - gentrification that will drive out the poor and destroy all that has made Harlem aesthetically distinctive. \"It's a corporate takeover,\" says Leon Griffith, who works in Record Shack, a music shop. \"It's all about money. It has always been a place of hustle and now they just want us to look like downtown Manhattan.\" </p> <p>What is at stake is far more than the fate of a small patch of real estate: it is the historical legacy that earned Harlem the title of the \"Negro capital of the world\", the urban backdrop for great dramas of the American 20th century; where Malcolm X was assassinated, Marcus Garvey marched, reds and blacks rioted, and everyone from Cab Calloway to James Brown performed. This is the place that inspired some of America's finest cultural moments, driving Langston Hughes to poetry, Zora Neale Hurston to prose, and Sarah Vaughan to song. </p> <p>Harlem is no stranger to change. It was settled by Dutch immigrants in 1658, and by the 19th century had become a wealthy suburb for European immigrants, particularly the Irish, Italians and Jews. But as African-Americans left the rural poverty and racial oppression of the South and headed north in search of opportunity, a few mostly Jewish and black estate agents with empty buildings and an eye for a profit awaited them. Ralph Ellison's protagonist took that journey in his landmark novel, Invisible Man. In a few years just before the first world war, the racial complexion of Harlem was transformed. </p> <p>The impact on Harlem was huge, and the influence of black politics no less so. The move from country to city and field to factory, at a time of great social turmoil around the globe, inspired both activism and ideology. Revolutions in Ireland, Russia and Germany, and the radicalising effect of the war, forged a new consciousness whose often contradictory strands - internationalism, communism, anti-racism, pan-Africanism - were woven together. </p> <p>\"Hitherto it must be admitted that American Negroes have been a race more in name than in fact, or to be exact, more in sentiment than experience,\" wrote Alain Locke, a professor of philosophy at the historically black university of Howard in Washington DC. \"The chief bond ... has been that of a condition in common rather than a life in common. In Harlem, Negro life is seizing upon its first chances for group expression and self determination.\" </p> <p>This change in ideas and the activism it engendered gave rise to the \"New Negro\" - by self-definition an urban, more radical northern relative of a down-trodden southern cousin. Poverty and discrimination may still have been widespread, but now America's black urban population felt politically and culturally equipped to deal with it differently. </p> <p>The mood was articulated by poet Langston Hughes in 1926: \"We younger Negro artists ... intend to express our individual dark-skinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn't matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly too ... If colored people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, their displeasure doesn't matter either. We build our temples for tomorrow, strong as we know how, and we stand on top of the mountain, free within ourselves.\" The birthplace of this political and temporal construct, said Locke in 1925, was Harlem, which \"had the same role to play for the New Negro as Dublin has had for the New Ireland or Prague for the New Czechoslovakia.\" </p> <p>This burgeoning spirit of self-assurance and defiance found its expression in the Harlem Renaissance. Although the term is often used, and universally recognised, its definition has always been elusive. Its period roughly spans from the end of the first world war to the beginning of the depression. This was the era that saw the emergence of some of the greatest names in black American letters. </p> <p>Jean Toomer's Cane, a volume of poems and novella, marked the beginning of the literary renaissance. He had been raised in Louisiana and later abandoned writing for mysticism. Zora Neale Hurston, a flamboyant, spirited young woman from Florida, challenged the sexism and class-snobbery of the renaissance, who did not publish her most famous work, Their Eyes Were Watching God. until the late 1930s. She ended her life in poverty, dying in a Floridan welfare home, and was buried in an unmarked grave. </p> <p>Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, has since called her \"one of the greatest writers of our age\". Langston Hughes, \"poet laureate of the renaissance\", also wrote short stories and novels but made his greatest impact with a book of verse, The Weary Blues. Claude McKay, Jamaican-born, racially-militant, politically radical wrote Home To Harlem, the first black novel on the bestseller lists. He was the enfant terrible of the renaissance: he converted to Catholicism late in life and moved to Chicago to work in a school. </p> <p>There were renaissance artworks, too: the sculpture of Meta Warwick Fuller, the paintings of Aaron Douglas, Palmer Hayden and William Johnson; the documentary photography of James Van Der Zee and the photographic portraits of Carl van Vechten. </p> <p>The renaissance was literary and artistic, but it was backed by the impressive soundtrack of the golden age of jazz. Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton and James P Johnson were in their prime, Duke Ellington and Fletcher Henderson were innovating, applying orchestral discipline to their creativity. The jazz age coincided with the renaissance, but it was not part of it. Artists rarely passed up a chance to play in Harlem, but their geographical axis was further south and west, their following more working class. </p> <p>Even though the \"New Negros\" of the renaissance, led by writers and artists, proudly asserted their intellectual independence, they were mostly financially reliant on white patrons. Their talents had to catch the attention of white editors and publishers who introduced the work to the mainstream in books or literary magazines. Beyond that, Harlem was in vogue. Black people lived there, but fashionable white people longed to be seen there, enjoying the success vicariously. </p> <p>The geographical proximity of all these black stars gave social and artistic momentum to their work. \"In those days there were a great many parties in Harlem to which various members of the New Negro group were invited,\" wrote Hughes in his autobiography, The Big Sea. \"These parties, when given by important Harlemites were reported in full in the society pages of the Harlem press.\" </p> <p>It was a movement and a moment; a literary, artistic and musical expression rooted in a time and place which, because of the nature of that time and that place, flitted between the political and the cultural, the interests of the elite and the needs of the many. \"Nothing will do more to change the mental attitude and raise [the Negro's] status,\" claimed essayist James Weldon Johnson, \"than a demonstration of intellectual parity by the Negro through his production of literature and art.\" </p> <p>The renaissance ended when Wall Street crashed, and its many white patrons withdrew. \"That was really the end of the gay times of the New Negro era in Harlem,\" wrote Hughes. \"The white people had much less money to spend on themselves, and practically none to spend on Negroes, for the depression brought everybody down a peg or two. And the Negroes had but few pegs to fall.\" </p> <p>The renaissance stalled, and left behind the human, geographical and economic space that had given the renaissance its name. In the dire days of the 1930s, Harlem descended into urban decay and cultural desolation. As early as 1930, in a prophetical essay, Black Manhattan, James Weldon Johnson foresaw inevitable change of a nature that still resonates today. \"Will the Negroes of Harlem be able to hold it? Residents of Manhattan, regardless of race, have been driven out when they lay in the path of business and greatly increased land values. Harlem lies in the direction that path must take; so there is little probability that Negroes will always hold it as a residential section.\" </p> <p>At the corner of Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King Boulevards there is a huge Disney store on one side and a Kentucky Fried Chicken on the other. The Audubon Ballroom, where Malcolm X was assassinated, the Cotton Club, where jazz heroes made their name, and the Harlem Opera House, have all been knocked down. A few blocks up you can see the brick imprint of what was the Teresa hotel, to which Fidel Castro famously decamped during a UN general assembly in 1960, claiming that he was being mistreated in Manhattan, and had more solidarity with the people of Harlem. </p> <p>The Apollo theatre, which once hosted Louis Armstrong, Bessie Smith and Aretha Franklin, still stands, although control of it has now been turned over to Time Warner. James Brown made his name on amateur night there, and that night's blend of ruthlessness and playfulness - booing unpopular acts off stage to the accompaniment of a clown-like executioner - continues. So do the step shows and religiously-inspired soul performances. But most of those in the expensive seats are Japanese, Korean and German tourists, not local African-Americans. </p> <p>\"It's like we don't exist any more and those of us who do exist are constantly looking for money to survive,\" says Dr Barbara Ann Teer, founder of the National Black Theatre. \"We need to develop an understanding of what we have begun to call culturenomics. We need to create the kind of cultural expressions that we can sustain here economically. We have to develop a support system of our own.\" </p> <p>Harlem is still poor. It maintained a rich cultural life and varied economic existence through the 1950s and early 1960s, though the emergence of a monied black middle class meant that resources and talent left the area, which then become a byword for urban decay and crime. Tours have become popular, but tourism has yet to take off. Since the Teresa shut it no longer has a hotel, although there are plans to build one. The crime rate has plummeted, but unemployment remains high at 18%, four times the national average. </p> <p>Harlem will receive almost a billion dollars in public and private funds over the next four years. But Leon Griffith says the money that is coming in goes out again just as fast. Record Shack, which has become a local institution since it started in the 1960s, has been struggling after an HMV opened around the corner. \"They may bring jobs to the area, but at the same time they are destroying our businesses,\" he says. \"We can't compete with HMV. I live in Harlem. So the money that used to stay in the community is now leaving it and we are losing control.\" </p> <p>According to the president of the 125th Street business improvement district, Barbara Askins, only 35 to 40% of retail businesses on the main drag are minority-owned. As more corporate fast-food outlets open, small joints whose names are a taste of Harlem life - \"No Pork on my fork\" and \"Nuff Niceness\" - will be threatened. Rents are rising; many are moving to the Bronx and Queens. Barbara Ann Teer says: \"They are bringing in the corporations and they are employing the workers. But they are not paying the workers enough to live in Harlem.\" </p> <p>The coach tourists are received by some - but not all - with mixed bewilderment and contempt. \"Sometimes tourism here is handled like it's a jungle safari,\" says Lloyd Williams, president and CEO of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce: \"Like they're in the wild kingdom, looking at the animals running around.\" </p> <p>In this atmosphere only the very strong, very big, or very canny survive. Sylvia's soul food cafe has opened Also Sylvia's next door, to cater for the tourist trade. Its 38th anniversary was sponsored by Rupert Murdoch's local television franchise, Fox Five. ADC, the non-profit wing of the Abyssinian Baptist church, employs a small army of estate agents, financiers, developers and lawyers. They have helped build a supermarket, day care centre and two schools, but are currently working on a deal with Gap and a chain-restaurant, the International House of Pancakes. </p> <p>\"One of our goals is to ensure longterm sustainability and for this we need to have a balance,\" says Walker, of the ADC, who interrupts our conversation for an urgent call with his broker. \"There is enough opportunity to protect the interests of poor people and the rights of the indigenous community to remain here while allowing for some people to move in. There were lawyers, maids, doctors, bus drivers in the past, and we are striving to make it socio-economically diverse.\" </p> <p>True, much of Harlem's past has been mythologised. The first renaissance may have been culturally black-led, but it was \"white-owned\" economically, which caused tension, particularly between Hurston and her patron, who wanted her to concentrate on the exotic rather than the anthropological. There was always a significant white presence in the renaissance period, and it was always greeted with a degree of ambivalence. In 1927, author Rudolph Fisher wrote in an essay, The Caucasian Storms Harlem: \"It may be a season's whim, then, this sudden contagious interest in everything Negro. If so, when I go into a familiar cabaret, or the place where a familiar cabaret used to be, and find it transformed and relatively colorless, I may be observing just one form that season's whim has taken.\" </p> <p>The issue now is neither should Harlem be economically developed - it already is - nor whether such development would change the character of the area - it has already done so. The issue is more on what terms will change take place and who will benefit as a result? Weldon Johnson said in 1930: \"The next move ... will be unlike the others. It will not be a move made solely at the behest of someone else; it will be more in the nature of a bargain.\" Many in Harlem wonder now whether they are selling themselves short, or whether the price is too high.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On Saturday night, Johnny's Recovery Room, a down-at-heel bar on Harlem's main drag, had been marinating in Motown and malt whisky. A woman who had been staring into space for at least half an hour had fallen off her perch on a bar stool only minutes after Gloria Gaynor had finished I Will Survive. She landed with a thud, remained there for a short while before being picked up and offered another drink. Minutes later an equally drunk man had danced out to Midnight Train To Georgia and cheers from the bar. But now, on 125th Street in the cold light of Sunday morning, the last partygoers are outnumbered by churchgoers. Saints and sinners pass each other as though in different worlds. The faithful, suited, booted and ready to pray, walk purposefully clutching Bibles in small suitcases, while the feckless, in last night's gladrags, sit on stoops holding cans of beer and bottles of whiskey in brown paper bags, watching the coaches go by. Large, plush, air conditioned vehicles are cruising Upper Manhattan with eager cargoes of tourists. Japanese, Germans, Koreans, British and even some Americans are now regular features in Harlem's Sunday landscape and cast a curious, slightly nervous, eye over the drunks who cast an ambivalent, slightly mocking, eye back. Later the tourists head for one of a select group of churches - to watch rather than worship - and then on to Sylvia's for soul food and a story to tell the folks back home. \"Harlem wears to the casual observer a casual face,\" wrote James Baldwin, who was born there. \"No one remarks that - considering the history of black men and women and the legends that have sprung up about them, to say nothing of the ever-present policemen, wary on the street corners - the face is, indeed, somewhat excessively casual and may not be as open or as careless as it seems.\" His essay, Harlem Ghetto, was written in 1948 but is as pertinent now as it has ever been. For surrounding the church-day nonchalance are signs of fundamental change. Some, like the Gap billboard, the Starbucks coffee shop and the scaffolding around the Abyssinian Baptist church are comparatively subtle. Others, like the Harlem USA shopping mall, the new buildings and the huge HMV store, are not. All are indications of the economic development pouring into the area over the past five years, a combination of government money and corporate investment that is changing the texture of life here not just commercially but culturally. To some this marks the second Harlem renaissance, mirroring the area's heyday early in the last century, when it was home to a new wave of African-American literature, art and music that exuded confidence and originality. It presents another opportunity to emerge from a public perception of urban decay and deprivation. \"We are only minutes away from some of the most expensive real estate in the world, yet there are still buildings in Harlem that remain vacant,\" says Darren Walker, chief operating officer of the Abyssinian Development Corporation, a non-profit organisation, affiliated to Harlem's biggest church. \"Rebuilding and filling them makes us a more attractive neighbourhood.\" To others the change represents a threat to spiritual integrity - gentrification that will drive out the poor and destroy all that has made Harlem aesthetically distinctive. \"It's a corporate takeover,\" says Leon Griffith, who works in Record Shack, a music shop. \"It's all about money. It has always been a place of hustle and now they just want us to look like downtown Manhattan.\" What is at stake is far more than the fate of a small patch of real estate: it is the historical legacy that earned Harlem the title of the \"Negro capital of the world\", the urban backdrop for great dramas of the American 20th century; where Malcolm X was assassinated, Marcus Garvey marched, reds and blacks rioted, and everyone from Cab Calloway to James Brown performed. This is the place that inspired some of America's finest cultural moments, driving Langston Hughes to poetry, Zora Neale Hurston to prose, and Sarah Vaughan to song. Harlem is no stranger to change. It was settled by Dutch immigrants in 1658, and by the 19th century had become a wealthy suburb for European immigrants, particularly the Irish, Italians and Jews. But as African-Americans left the rural poverty and racial oppression of the South and headed north in search of opportunity, a few mostly Jewish and black estate agents with empty buildings and an eye for a profit awaited them. Ralph Ellison's protagonist took that journey in his landmark novel, Invisible Man. In a few years just before the first world war, the racial complexion of Harlem was transformed. The impact on Harlem was huge, and the influence of black politics no less so. The move from country to city and field to factory, at a time of great social turmoil around the globe, inspired both activism and ideology. Revolutions in Ireland, Russia and Germany, and the radicalising effect of the war, forged a new consciousness whose often contradictory strands - internationalism, communism, anti-racism, pan-Africanism - were woven together. \"Hitherto it must be admitted that American Negroes have been a race more in name than in fact, or to be exact, more in sentiment than experience,\" wrote Alain Locke, a professor of philosophy at the historically black university of Howard in Washington DC. \"The chief bond ... has been that of a condition in common rather than a life in common. In Harlem, Negro life is seizing upon its first chances for group expression and self determination.\" This change in ideas and the activism it engendered gave rise to the \"New Negro\" - by self-definition an urban, more radical northern relative of a down-trodden southern cousin.

      "body": "<p>Ten years' longing for a plot in which to realise my wildest gardening dreams finally came to an end late last summer when, spurred on by impending parenthood, my girlfriend Kirsten and I put an end to procrastination and moved from south London to a country cottage in East Sussex.</p> <p>Along with the house-swap came the chance to relinquish my urban \"estate\" of two tatty window boxes and to embrace the challenge of a partially overgrown, empty and unkempt 15m x 45m rural plot. Our virgin ground, which runs alongside a lane, comprised a large, spring-fed pond at its far end, the ruins of an outbuilding and the cottage itself. A decent size, but without being too big. I was excited as to what wonders we might perform here.</p> <p>However, on my first midwinter stroll outdoors to contemplate creative wizardry and put my name in the gardening halls of fame, I became rapidly confused - the possibilities seemed so endless. All manner of ideas flared up - terraces with romantic topiary, ornamental parterres, surreal sculptures made from recycled objects - and all of them well beyond both budget and feasibility.</p> <p>With a mind full of mirages, I was getting nowhere fast and frustration was mounting, so I retreated indoors for a week or so and glared at the garden - while it glared back at me. When this standoff began to ease, I tried again, but this time with a more measured approach. With our lofty ambitions of aesthetic conquest now laid aside, we surveyed the garden afresh and began making decisions based on common sense and practicality.</p> <p>We looked at each individual area, and started to devise down-to-earth solutions that were led by the garden, rather than imposed on it. Behind the picket fence between the house and the lane, you would expect to find a typical cottage garden - all show for passers-by. Going with this theme, we decided to distil its essence into a random collection of tall herbaceous perennials: a phallic flowering frenzy.</p> <p>Over a period of a month or so, we hoarded pink and purple foxgloves, blue and yellow lupins, electric blue delphiniums, apricot foxtail lilies, red-hot pokers, burgundy pentstemons and yellow asphodelines. When we had amassed enough to pack the bed - about six plants per square metre - we laid them out and moved them around until the right combination of colourful chaos seemed most likely. And into the warming, rich, moist soil they went, hidden like dormant secrets that the coming seasons would reveal to us.</p> <p>The large pond, meanwhile, was suffering from severe clogging by a rampant South American aquatic plant, Myriophyllum aquaticum, or 'Parrot's Feather'. This is one of many risky alien species that, if left unchecked, will rapidly outgrow all native aquatic plants and fill a pond with a massed tangle of growth - overpowering not only other plants but any fish and amphibians as well.</p> <p>The only remedy in such a situation is to don waders and get physical - in my case to the tune of several hundredweight of stinking stems that I dredged from dark waters. We brought with us one item of furniture - a huge seat, nicknamed The Giant's Rest - built out of recycled timbers and rope to outsized proportions: 10ft long, with a seat high enough from the ground for even the tallest adult's feet to dangle. But where to put it in this plot with barely any open spaces? The garden itself presented us with a perfect site, backing on to a hedge between a large maple tree and a small flowering cherry - the seat nestled between the two trunks almost made to measure with inches to spare.

A rayed semicircle of slate slabs inter-planted with aromatic Corsican mint that I laid at its feet as a take-off and landing point made a decorative link with the seat's westward-facing, sunset orientation. We decided to leave a large grassy bank, bristling with nettles, between the pond and the outbuilding as a reminder of the garden's former wildness, as well as to provide a source of nettles for tea and soup, and, not least, a habitat for wildlife and insects, particularly butterflies.</p> <p>However, on the other side of this ruin, behind the house, was a spot that begged to be cultivated.

      "bodyText": "Ten years' longing for a plot in which to realise my wildest gardening dreams finally came to an end late last summer when, spurred on by impending parenthood, my girlfriend Kirsten and I put an end to procrastination and moved from south London to a country cottage in East Sussex. Along with the house-swap came the chance to relinquish my urban \"estate\" of two tatty window boxes and to embrace the challenge of a partially overgrown, empty and unkempt 15m x 45m rural plot. Our virgin ground, which runs alongside a lane, comprised a large, spring-fed pond at its far end, the ruins of an outbuilding and the cottage itself. A decent size, but without being too big. I was excited as to what wonders we might perform here. However, on my first midwinter stroll outdoors to contemplate creative wizardry and put my name in the gardening halls of fame, I became rapidly confused - the possibilities seemed so endless. All manner of ideas flared up - terraces with romantic topiary, ornamental parterres, surreal sculptures made from recycled objects - and all of them well beyond both budget and feasibility. With a mind full of mirages, I was getting nowhere fast and frustration was mounting, so I retreated indoors for a week or so and glared at the garden - while it glared back at me. When this standoff began to ease, I tried again, but this time with a more measured approach. With our lofty ambitions of aesthetic conquest now laid aside, we surveyed the garden afresh and began making decisions based on common sense and practicality. We looked at each individual area, and started to devise down-to-earth solutions that were led by the garden, rather than imposed on it. Behind the picket fence between the house and the lane, you would expect to find a typical cottage garden - all show for passers-by. Going with this theme, we decided to distil its essence into a random collection of tall herbaceous perennials: a phallic flowering frenzy. Over a period of a month or so, we hoarded pink and purple foxgloves, blue and yellow lupins, electric blue delphiniums, apricot foxtail lilies, red-hot pokers, burgundy pentstemons and yellow asphodelines. When we had amassed enough to pack the bed - about six plants per square metre - we laid them out and moved them around until the right combination of colourful chaos seemed most likely. And into the warming, rich, moist soil they went, hidden like dormant secrets that the coming seasons would reveal to us. The large pond, meanwhile, was suffering from severe clogging by a rampant South American aquatic plant, Myriophyllum aquaticum, or 'Parrot's Feather'. This is one of many risky alien species that, if left unchecked, will rapidly outgrow all native aquatic plants and fill a pond with a massed tangle of growth - overpowering not only other plants but any fish and amphibians as well. The only remedy in such a situation is to don waders and get physical - in my case to the tune of several hundredweight of stinking stems that I dredged from dark waters. We brought with us one item of furniture - a huge seat, nicknamed The Giant's Rest - built out of recycled timbers and rope to outsized proportions: 10ft long, with a seat high enough from the ground for even the tallest adult's feet to dangle. But where to put it in this plot with barely any open spaces?

      "body": "<p>Goldsborough Road in the hot summer sun smelled of dust and pigeons. I don't remember it in the rain. As children, up from the country every Friday to see our grandparents, the London children scared us slightly, at home in their street where my brother and I would only ever be visitors. They let us play football and hopscotch with them, a pleasure tinged with fear of loose dogs who knew us for the strangers we were, and Johnny the man-boy, who seemed to live nowhere in particular, who dribbled and smiled and did no harm, but who embarrassed us because we couldn't understand what he said.</p> <p>In those days, the late 60s and early 70s, the two-storey terraced street in South Lambeth, near the site of the old Covent Garden fruit and vegetable market, had hardly changed since it had been purpose-built, mostly as flats, in the 1880s. Nana and Grandad's flat at No 31 was typical: the front door opened into a narrow corridor (\"the passage\"). First door on the right was the front room, always cold and, perversely, hardly ever used, despite the fact that space was at a premium. Next on the right was the bedroom, where Grandad might be sleeping - he worked nights at a printworks. At the end of the passage was the living room, although it was called the kitchen, and a door off that at the back led to a tiny kitchen, which was called the scullery. Here, Nana cooked and everyone washed; Grandad emerging, impossibly tall in white long johns, smelling of Golden Virginia and coal-tar soap. Open the back door off the scullery, and you were outside again, in a tiny pocket of private open air, the yard.</p> <p>This was the second address our grandparents lived at in Goldsborough Road; moving around the street was something everyone seemed to do. They'd been upstairs at 31A to begin with, and raised my dad and uncle, Reg and Ted, there. The flats had a small patch of flat roof instead of a yard. According to family legend, their dog, Bob, was sunning himself on the roof one day when one of the boys called to him from the street. Bob jumped off the roof and famously fatally impaled himself on the iron railings in the street below. (The railings are long gone now, melted down for the war effort, or dumped into the Channel, depending on which story you believe; and either Ted or Reg were to blame for poor Bob's sticky end, according to who's telling the tale.) By the time my brother, myself and our cousins arrived, Nana and Grandad had moved downstairs, lost a roof and gained a yard.</p> <p>The yard was screened from the neighbours by a patchwork of fence and trellis. Leafy hints of adjacent gardens poked through, but Grandad had concreted his yard, banishing plants to pots on racks attached to the fence. Everything was painted green, and the plants were carefully labelled in stencilled white paint: COALIUS on the left, NURSTURIANTS on the right, and, defying Grandad's creative spelling, SWEET PEAS in the middle. He seems to have felt that nature was all very well, in its place - the country. His cement garden was weed-free, his plants exiled to pots where he could keep an eye on what they were up to. In Goldsborough Road, earth and dirt were considered the same thing.</p> <p>In one corner of the yard, exuding feathers and contented noises, was the pigeon coop. The pigeons later moved to the roof of a friend further up the street, and the coop became a Wendy house for our cousins and ourselves, but it still smelled of pigeons. We loved Grandad's yard. It was also the path to the lavatory. At night, as a child, slipping out to the loo under a starry sky was a small adventure. It wasn't until I was much older, and read about outside toilets and homes without bathrooms, that I realised that this was considered a less than ideal arrangement. To us, sitting in the tin bath in front of the coal fire in the \"kitchen\" was always a treat, a convivial and social event, when grown-ups looked at us and smiled at each other.</p> <p>Before the street was dominated by parked vehicles, it used easily to accommodate a sprawling game of football; only a handful of cars belonged in the street, and those that didn't belong never came down it, as it wasn't on the way to anywhere. The fact that the street was the place to play meant that no one minded - or even noticed - the postage-stamp yards. The yard was where you hung the washing. If people wanted to sit in the sun, they never sat in the yard; the men, like Grandad, placed a kitchen chair, back to front, outside the front door and sat on it facing the street, resting their arms on the chair-back, reading the paper, or having a smoke or a chat with a neighbour who was doing the same.</p> <p>Although there were no front gardens, the strip of pavement directly outside \"belonged\" to the house, and most people regularly swept their patch. No inhabitant of the street would pass another without exchanging a word; we would dangle about Grandad's chair, our prattle punctuated only by his \"Afternoon, George\", \"Alright, Charlie?\", \"Wotcher, Bill\", which was returned as naturally and inevitably as breathing.</p> <p>It's not, of course, that people have changed, but the way we live. Most of the people in that street had lived there for longer than they cared to remember. Our grandparents were typical, having moved there when they got married, each having been born in streets either side. That's why everyone knew everyone - they couldn't avoid them.</p> <p>Grandad was long dead before indoor plumbing came to Goldsborough Road; the scullery became a bathroom and the kitchen really was a kitchen. Nana - at last - used the front room, and was able in her 80s to have a bath without lugging the tin one off its nail in the coal hole and laboriously filling it up with buckets of hot water from the scullery. She lived there until she died, aged 93. When it was built, Goldsborough Road was one of many similar parallel streets, and was unexceptional. Now the world around it has been swept away; what escaped being flattened by the Luftwaffe has been decimated by developers, leaving Goldsborough Road and the few streets around it as accidental survivors of prewar London, an island of the old city. All around, new flats, new streets have sprung up. When we were kids, a lot of this was still wasteland, undeveloped since it was bombed during the war. Parts of houses stood in places, propped up until someone got around to pulling them down; here and there, the incongruous sight of a fireplace set in a square of flowered wallpaper defied floorlessness, rooflessness, hopelessness. We were not allowed to play near these teetering skeletons, where unexploded bombs might still lurk.</p> <p>As a student in London in my 20s, I often stayed with Nana, and noted things the child had missed. Visitors always remarked on how peaceful it was - the street was exceptionally quiet for the heart of London. For a residential area only minutes from the West End by car, it surprisingly escaped being either pretentious or grotty. A certain amount of yuppie gentrification had taken place, but the overall impression was of a pleasant, unambitious street that had been left to its own devices and decided not to do much at all.</p> <p>For some reason - probably cost - there is no access to the back yards from the street; when Grandad used to come home on his motor scooter, he wheeled it through the passage, which clung to its oily whiff. The Goldsborough Road of our Dad's childhood still featured horses; the milkman who lived in the street was obliged to take his horse through his house after his round, to stable it in his back yard. His anxious wife pursued him, offering up a bucket in case of a mishap on the short journey. An early memory of my Dad's is of two great shire horses panicking (for some forgotten reason) in the street and thundering over the cobbles, pulling a driverless cart behind them, imminently threatening to trample some passing unfortunate to death (were they headed straight for an unattended pram?). Grandad heroically went to the rescue, grabbing and calming the horses and saving lives right, left and centre. My father acknowledges the pernicious effects of romance on the memory: the image in his mind is of Grandad being lifted high into the air by the rearing beasts as he clung bravely to the reins, but he readily admits this was probably not the case. Perhaps there was only one horse. A small one. Nevertheless, the act seemed heroic at the time, and as the memory fades the imagination repairs it, so its essence should not be lost. So it is with Goldsborough Road. Can I really remember it? Or just the idea of it? My cousin, Martin, a photographer, wanted to go back and find out whether there was any trace of what had seemed indefinably precious about Goldsborough Road. The last time we'd been there was five years ago, for Nana's funeral. Now that we had no claim on the street, would its spell have been broken? Would it be noisier, dirtier, less friendly, more ordinary than we had fondly believed? There were more immediate anxieties, too: I was worried that no one would talk to us - why should they? Martin was concerned that his camera might put them off. So, full of misgiving, we went to South Lambeth on one of the hottest days of last summer to discover whether this London street still held the charm of the golden borough of our childhood.</p> <p>\u00a9 Sarah Burton 2000. Sarah Burton's book, Impostors, a narrative non-fiction work about people who assume false identities, is published by Viking Penguin at \u00a315.99.</p> <p><b>Yeliz and Seniz</b> Yeliz, four, and Seniz, six, are two of the very few children living in the street. The family is from Cyprus, although the girls' mother has lived in Goldsborough Road for 30 years. We find Yeliz and Seniz playing on their bikes outside their house, and they tell us they like the street because, as Yeliz says, 'it's so fun'. We ask them whether they feel safe here - they do, but their father doesn't agree. He does like the fact that it's quiet: 'In some streets you can't even sleep. Here, it's no problem.' The girls think it's a pity there aren't more children around, but point out their cousins' house across the street, and add that it's easy to get to Battersea Park - evidently a big favourite. 'It's just a normal London street,' says Dad. 'I like it because it's my home,' adds Seniz.</p> <p><b>Dee and Gail</b> Dee and Gail had recently made legal history when we visited them. An assistant chief probation officer and a programme manager for a children's play gym, they ran into problems when Gail's visa from South Africa expired. They campaigned for four years to have a gay relationship receive the same legal recognition as a heterosexual one, and became a test case. 'People in the street were very supportive - especially the older ones. They accept us; they call us \"the girls\".'</p> <p>Dee had lived in several parts of London before moving to the street 13 years ago, and is now in her second flat in Goldsborough Road. 'It feels like the safest place I've ever lived in London. It's like a little secret. You can go to the theatre in the West End and walk home along the river. We're 20 minutes from Big Ben - on foot.'</p> <p>'I lived in Notting Hill for two years and never knew any of the neighbours,' says Gail.</p> <p>'I found it quite strange. I couldn't believe how friendly people were here. It's like your perfect London street ... If you've got a really big problem, you can always knock on the door of one of the elders, which is how I think of them. It sounds corny, but people really do help each other out.'</p> <p>Surely not everyone feels this way? Dee thinks. 'Short-term renters keep themselves to themselves. But if you stay, or if you buy, you're in.'</p> <p><b>Samiye, Hussein, Feyziye and Melek</b> Samiye has lived in Goldsborough Road since 1976, and her husband Hussein runs the family's ice-cream business. Feyziye, 10, and Melek, 16, love it: 'It's in the middle of everything and you know everyone.' Samiye's mother, Melek's namesake, lives next door, and other Turkish-Cypriot relatives live opposite. But the family is moving. 'The old atmosphere has gone,' Samiye says. 'A lot of people have moved, and we don't know half the people in the street any more. When I was four and five years old, we used to play Knock Down Ginger and Tin Can Alley in the street and there would be 20 or 25 other kids to play with. There's hardly any kids here now. It's all youngsters moving in and out. We used to have a chat in the street, but the new people keep themselves to themselves. We've always wanted a bigger garden, so now seems a good time to go.' We ask Samiye whether she's already put her house on the market. 'Oh no, I'm not selling it!' she exclaims. 'I'm going to rent it out. Money's not everything,' she smiles. 'And I might not like it somewhere else.'</p> <p><b>Doreen </b> Martin Burton's father, Edward, her former next-door neighbour who grew up at No 31) lived at No 12 until she was bombed out during the Blitz (fortunately with no injuries) and moved to No 30. She is now at her third address in Goldsborough Road. 'You don't know everybody in the street like you used to, but people are fairly friendly.' She remembers Johnny, the child-like man who had so disconcerted us as kids.</p> <p>'He loved cars. He used to like to open the doors. If anyone had a go at him, the other kids used to protect him. That family moved away. I heard his mother died and he went into care. Then he died.' We asked what it was like living there during the war. 'When you think about it now, you think it was really frightening, and we were scared during the raids. But it just became part of life; you had to get on with it. We used to go under the railway arches, and there'd be hot soup and we'd entertain ourselves. We did enjoy ourselves and made the most of it.'</p> <p><b>Ola</b> Ola works for the Home Office. 'I like it here, it's safe and quiet. Once a friend had some things stolen from her car, but that was really strange. When I first came here on the bus, I thought, \"Oh my God, where have I come to?\" But as soon as I turned the corner at the top of the street, I thought, \"Yeah. This is nice.\"'</p> <p><b>Peter</b> Peter has lived with his partner, Graham, in the street for four years. 'People say hello, and do congregate over issues, but we're not in and out of each others' houses all the time. One day, we challenged someone who was dumping rubbish. Usually, you'd be on your own, but neighbours gathered round and said, \"What do you think you're doing?\"'</p> <p><b>Clare and Robin</b> Clare and Robin work in marketing and have lived in the street for four months. Says Robin: 'It's handy for work' - Robin works in the West End and Clare in the City - 'and it's so quiet. We plan to stay indefinitely.'</p> <p><b>James and Sascha</b> James and Sascha, a product manager for a paper manufacturer and a nursery school teacher, came to Goldsborough Road four years ago and have owned five properties in the street. Starting off in an upstairs flat, they have now bought and extended a house to accommodate the family they plan to have. 'It's quiet, close to the centre of town and the neighbours are so friendly. We'd only move now if we moved out of London,' says James.</p> <p><b>Jessie</b> Jessie is our second cousin, and is our only remaining connection with Goldsborough Road. She moved into her flat in 1945, and raised three sons there, two of whom were born at home. She knows most people, and waters plants and feeds cats for absent neighbours.</p> <p>We asked her whether it was true that when our dads were kids people didn't lock their doors. 'In the summer we didn't even shut them. We'd sleep with the front door and the back door open to get a breeze through the place. Everyone did. All along the street all the doors were wide open all night. It was just what you did. In the summer, after the pub on a Saturday night, we'd have a whip-round and get a crate of beer. The men would push the piano out into the street and we'd have a party. People didn't have a lot of money, but we knew how to enjoy ourselves all right.'</p> <p><b>Bertie</b> Bertie is nearly 10, and has lived on the street for more than half his life. He used to live full-time with Dominic and Jacqui, but due to their work commitments now spends more time across the street with Jessie, of whom he is fiercely protective. He is a frequent visitor to other addresses in the street. 'He loves it here and they all love him,' Jessie assures us.</p> <p><b>Bill and Mel</b> Bill and Mel are journalists. Mel bought the flat three years ago. Mel said: 'At first I thought the street looked very unlikely, but it's really nice. The first summer we were here, the family next door often played backgammon on a table on the pavement - the grandad, the kids ... The street's got a lot smarter recently. There's always someone decorating or renovating activity. We'd only move for more space.'</p> <p><b>Melek</b> Melek lives next door to her daughter, Samiye, and her family. She moved to Goldsborough Road in 1968, from Putney, and was born in Cyprus. She's not as keen on leaving as her daughter. 'My husband never wanted to move, and since he died I find it quite hard to leave the memories. Everyone is nice, not just the old people. A young man came and knocked on the door the other day and said, \"Hello, I am so-and-so, I have just moved in.\" It's nice. I went to stay with my other daughter in Sidcup. Apart from the next-door neighbour, it seemed nobody cared about anybody. I got so depressed. People are warm and polite here. I wouldn't let it go easily.'</p> <p><b>Michael, Steve and Larry</b> Michael is a chartered surveyor: 'I've lived here for eight months and I'm looking for my own flat in the street. It's friendly, there's no residents' parking, I like the ice-cream vans. In summer, the terraces hum with the buzz of people outside. It's homely.' Steve works in IT: 'I've lived here for three weeks. It's convenient and I really like the house.' Larry works in banking: 'I moved in two days ago. It's handy for Chelsea football ground and the West End. So far, so good.'</p> <p><b>Susan</b> Susan is a liaison officer at King's College Hospital and has lived in two flats in the street. She was born in Walthamstow, the eldest of six children, but the family emigrated to Australia in 1963 and she's the only one to have come back (in 1968, aged 21). 'I think it's a lovely street and such a fantastic location. People say it's quiet, but they mean traffic. I like the human noises - they're comforting sounds. One day I'll go back to Australia to be with my parents, who are getting on, but I'll stay here until then.'</p> <p><b>Dominic, Jacqui and Alex</b> Dominic and Jacqui lived in Sri Lanka and Ecuador before coming to Goldsborough Road five years ago. Says Dominic, a technology marketing manager for Motorola:'When we were looking for a property, our criteria were: it had to have a kitchen big enough to eat in and a roof terrace.

      "bodyText": "Goldsborough Road in the hot summer sun smelled of dust and pigeons. I don't remember it in the rain. As children, up from the country every Friday to see our grandparents, the London children scared us slightly, at home in their street where my brother and I would only ever be visitors. They let us play football and hopscotch with them, a pleasure tinged with fear of loose dogs who knew us for the strangers we were, and Johnny the man-boy, who seemed to live nowhere in particular, who dribbled and smiled and did no harm, but who embarrassed us because we couldn't understand what he said. In those days, the late 60s and early 70s, the two-storey terraced street in South Lambeth, near the site of the old Covent Garden fruit and vegetable market, had hardly changed since it had been purpose-built, mostly as flats, in the 1880s. Nana and Grandad's flat at No 31 was typical: the front door opened into a narrow corridor (\"the passage\"). First door on the right was the front room, always cold and, perversely, hardly ever used, despite the fact that space was at a premium. Next on the right was the bedroom, where Grandad might be sleeping - he worked nights at a printworks. At the end of the passage was the living room, although it was called the kitchen, and a door off that at the back led to a tiny kitchen, which was called the scullery. Here, Nana cooked and everyone washed; Grandad emerging, impossibly tall in white long johns, smelling of Golden Virginia and coal-tar soap. Open the back door off the scullery, and you were outside again, in a tiny pocket of private open air, the yard. This was the second address our grandparents lived at in Goldsborough Road; moving around the street was something everyone seemed to do. They'd been upstairs at 31A to begin with, and raised my dad and uncle, Reg and Ted, there. The flats had a small patch of flat roof instead of a yard. According to family legend, their dog, Bob, was sunning himself on the roof one day when one of the boys called to him from the street. Bob jumped off the roof and famously fatally impaled himself on the iron railings in the street below. (The railings are long gone now, melted down for the war effort, or dumped into the Channel, depending on which story you believe; and either Ted or Reg were to blame for poor Bob's sticky end, according to who's telling the tale.) By the time my brother, myself and our cousins arrived, Nana and Grandad had moved downstairs, lost a roof and gained a yard. The yard was screened from the neighbours by a patchwork of fence and trellis. Leafy hints of adjacent gardens poked through, but Grandad had concreted his yard, banishing plants to pots on racks attached to the fence. Everything was painted green, and the plants were carefully labelled in stencilled white paint: COALIUS on the left, NURSTURIANTS on the right, and, defying Grandad's creative spelling, SWEET PEAS in the middle. He seems to have felt that nature was all very well, in its place - the country. His cement garden was weed-free, his plants exiled to pots where he could keep an eye on what they were up to. In Goldsborough Road, earth and dirt were considered the same thing. In one corner of the yard, exuding feathers and contented noises, was the pigeon coop. The pigeons later moved to the roof of a friend further up the street, and the coop became a Wendy house for our cousins and ourselves, but it still smelled of pigeons. We loved Grandad's yard. It was also the path to the lavatory. At night, as a child, slipping out to the loo under a starry sky was a small adventure. It wasn't until I was much older, and read about outside toilets and homes without bathrooms, that I realised that this was considered a less than ideal arrangement. To us, sitting in the tin bath in front of the coal fire in the \"kitchen\" was always a treat, a convivial and social event, when grown-ups looked at us and smiled at each other. Before the street was dominated by parked vehicles, it used easily to accommodate a sprawling game of football; only a handful of cars belonged in the street, and those that didn't belong never came down it, as it wasn't on the way to anywhere. The fact that the street was the place to play meant that no one minded - or even noticed - the postage-stamp yards. The yard was where you hung the washing. If people wanted to sit in the sun, they never sat in the yard; the men, like Grandad, placed a kitchen chair, back to front, outside the front door and sat on it facing the street, resting their arms on the chair-back, reading the paper, or having a smoke or a chat with a neighbour who was doing the same. Although there were no front gardens, the strip of pavement directly outside \"belonged\" to the house, and most people regularly swept their patch. No inhabitant of the street would pass another without exchanging a word; we would dangle about Grandad's chair, our prattle punctuated only by his \"Afternoon, George\", \"Alright, Charlie?\", \"Wotcher, Bill\", which was returned as naturally and inevitably as breathing. It's not, of course, that people have changed, but the way we live. Most of the people in that street had lived there for longer than they cared to remember. Our grandparents were typical, having moved there when they got married, each having been born in streets either side. That's why everyone knew everyone - they couldn't avoid them. Grandad was long dead before indoor plumbing came to Goldsborough Road; the scullery became a bathroom and the kitchen really was a kitchen. Nana - at last - used the front room, and was able in her 80s to have a bath without lugging the tin one off its nail in the coal hole and laboriously filling it up with buckets of hot water from the scullery. She lived there until she died, aged 93. When it was built, Goldsborough Road was one of many similar parallel streets, and was unexceptional. Now the world around it has been swept away; what escaped being flattened by the Luftwaffe has been decimated by developers, leaving Goldsborough Road and the few streets around it as accidental survivors of prewar London, an island of the old city. All around, new flats, new streets have sprung up. When we were kids, a lot of this was still wasteland, undeveloped since it was bombed during the war. Parts of houses stood in places, propped up until someone got around to pulling them down; here and there, the incongruous sight of a fireplace set in a square of flowered wallpaper defied floorlessness, rooflessness, hopelessness. We were not allowed to play near these teetering skeletons, where unexploded bombs might still lurk. As a student in London in my 20s, I often stayed with Nana, and noted things the child had missed. Visitors always remarked on how peaceful it was - the street was exceptionally quiet for the heart of London. For a residential area only minutes from the West End by car, it surprisingly escaped being either pretentious or grotty. A certain amount of yuppie gentrification had taken place, but the overall impression was of a pleasant, unambitious street that had been left to its own devices and decided not to do much at all. For some reason - probably cost - there is no access to the back yards from the street; when Grandad used to come home on his motor scooter, he wheeled it through the passage, which clung to its oily whiff. The Goldsborough Road of our Dad's childhood still featured horses; the milkman who lived in the street was obliged to take his horse through his house after his round, to stable it in his back yard. His anxious wife pursued him, offering up a bucket in case of a mishap on the short journey. An early memory of my Dad's is of two great shire horses panicking (for some forgotten reason) in the street and thundering over the cobbles, pulling a driverless cart behind them, imminently threatening to trample some passing unfortunate to death (were they headed straight for an unattended pram?). Grandad heroically went to the rescue, grabbing and calming the horses and saving lives right, left and centre. My father acknowledges the pernicious effects of romance on the memory: the image in his mind is of Grandad being lifted high into the air by the rearing beasts as he clung bravely to the reins, but he readily admits this was probably not the case. Perhaps there was only one horse. A small one. Nevertheless, the act seemed heroic at the time, and as the memory fades the imagination repairs it, so its essence should not be lost. So it is with Goldsborough Road. Can I really remember it? Or just the idea of it? My cousin, Martin, a photographer, wanted to go back and find out whether there was any trace of what had seemed indefinably precious about Goldsborough Road. The last time we'd been there was five years ago, for Nana's funeral. Now that we had no claim on the street, would its spell have been broken? Would it be noisier, dirtier, less friendly, more ordinary than we had fondly believed? There were more immediate anxieties, too: I was worried that no one would talk to us - why should they? Martin was concerned that his camera might put them off. So, full of misgiving, we went to South Lambeth on one of the hottest days of last summer to discover whether this London street still held the charm of the golden borough of our childhood. \u00a9 Sarah Burton 2000. Sarah Burton's book, Impostors, a narrative non-fiction work about people who assume false identities, is published by Viking Penguin at \u00a315.99. Yeliz and Seniz Yeliz, four, and Seniz, six, are two of the very few children living in the street. The family is from Cyprus, although the girls' mother has lived in Goldsborough Road for 30 years. We find Yeliz and Seniz playing on their bikes outside their house, and they tell us they like the street because, as Yeliz says, 'it's so fun'. We ask them whether they feel safe here - they do, but their father doesn't agree. He does like the fact that it's quiet: 'In some streets you can't even sleep. Here, it's no problem.' The girls think it's a pity there aren't more children around, but point out their cousins' house across the street, and add that it's easy to get to Battersea Park - evidently a big favourite. 'It's just a normal London street,' says Dad. 'I like it because it's my home,' adds Seniz. Dee and Gail Dee and Gail had recently made legal history when we visited them. An assistant chief probation officer and a programme manager for a children's play gym, they ran into problems when Gail's visa from South Africa expired. They campaigned for four years to have a gay relationship receive the same legal recognition as a heterosexual one, and became a test case. 'People in the street were very supportive - especially the older ones. They accept us; they call us \"the girls\".' Dee had lived in several parts of London before moving to the street 13 years ago, and is now in her second flat in Goldsborough Road. 'It feels like the safest place I've ever lived in London. It's like a little secret. You can go to the theatre in the West End and walk home along the river. We're 20 minutes from Big Ben - on foot.' 'I lived in Notting Hill for two years and never knew any of the neighbours,' says Gail. 'I found it quite strange. I couldn't believe how friendly people were here. It's like your perfect London street ... If you've got a really big problem, you can always knock on the door of one of the elders, which is how I think of them. It sounds corny, but people really do help each other out.' Surely not everyone feels this way? Dee thinks. 'Short-term renters keep themselves to themselves. But if you stay, or if you buy, you're in.' Samiye, Hussein, Feyziye and Melek Samiye has lived in Goldsborough Road since 1976, and her husband Hussein runs the family's ice-cream business. Feyziye, 10, and Melek, 16, love it: 'It's in the middle of everything and you know everyone.' Samiye's mother, Melek's namesake, lives next door, and other Turkish-Cypriot relatives live opposite. But the family is moving. 'The old atmosphere has gone,' Samiye says. 'A lot of people have moved, and we don't know half the people in the street any more. When I was four and five years old, we used to play Knock Down Ginger and Tin Can Alley in the street and there would be 20 or 25 other kids to play with. There's hardly any kids here now. It's all youngsters moving in and out. We used to have a chat in the street, but the new people keep themselves to themselves. We've always wanted a bigger garden, so now seems a good time to go.' We ask Samiye whether she's already put her house on the market. 'Oh no, I'm not selling it!' she exclaims. 'I'm going to rent it out. Money's not everything,' she smiles. 'And I might not like it somewhere else.' Doreen Martin Burton's father, Edward, her former next-door neighbour who grew up at No 31) lived at No 12 until she was bombed out during the Blitz (fortunately with no injuries) and moved to No 30. She is now at her third address in Goldsborough Road. 'You don't know everybody in the street like you used to, but people are fairly friendly.' She remembers Johnny, the child-like man who had so disconcerted us as kids. 'He loved cars. He used to like to open the doors. If anyone had a go at him, the other kids used to protect him. That family moved away. I heard his mother died and he went into care. Then he died.' We asked what it was like living there during the war. 'When you think about it now, you think it was really frightening, and we were scared during the raids. But it just became part of life; you had to get on with it. We used to go under the railway arches, and there'd be hot soup and we'd entertain ourselves. We did enjoy ourselves and made the most of it.' Ola Ola works for the Home Office. 'I like it here, it's safe and quiet. Once a friend had some things stolen from her car, but that was really strange. When I first came here on the bus, I thought, \"Oh my God, where have I come to?\" But as soon as I turned the corner at the top of the street, I thought, \"Yeah. This is nice.\"' Peter Peter has lived with his partner, Graham, in the street for four years. 'People say hello, and do congregate over issues, but we're not in and out of each others' houses all the time. One day, we challenged someone who was dumping rubbish. Usually, you'd be on your own, but neighbours gathered round and said, \"What do you think you're doing?\"' Clare and Robin Clare and Robin work in marketing and have lived in the street for four months. Says Robin: 'It's handy for work' - Robin works in the West End and Clare in the City - 'and it's so quiet. We plan to stay indefinitely.' James and Sascha James and Sascha, a product manager for a paper manufacturer and a nursery school teacher, came to Goldsborough Road four years ago and have owned five properties in the street. Starting off in an upstairs flat, they have now bought and extended a house to accommodate the family they plan to have. 'It's quiet, close to the centre of town and the neighbours are so friendly. We'd only move now if we moved out of London,' says James. Jessie Jessie is our second cousin, and is our only remaining connection with Goldsborough Road. She moved into her flat in 1945, and raised three sons there, two of whom were born at home. She knows most people, and waters plants and feeds cats for absent neighbours. We asked her whether it was true that when our dads were kids people didn't lock their doors. 'In the summer we didn't even shut them. We'd sleep with the front door and the back door open to get a breeze through the place. Everyone did. All along the street all the doors were wide open all night. It was just what you did. In the summer, after the pub on a Saturday night, we'd have a whip-round and get a crate of beer. The men would push the piano out into the street and we'd have a party. People didn't have a lot of money, but we knew how to enjoy ourselves all right.' Bertie Bertie is nearly 10, and has lived on the street for more than half his life. He used to live full-time with Dominic and Jacqui, but due to their work commitments now spends more time across the street with Jessie, of whom he is fiercely protective. He is a frequent visitor to other addresses in the street. 'He loves it here and they all love him,' Jessie assures us. Bill and Mel Bill and Mel are journalists. Mel bought the flat three years ago. Mel said: 'At first I thought the street looked very unlikely, but it's really nice. The first summer we were here, the family next door often played backgammon on a table on the pavement - the grandad, the kids ... The street's got a lot smarter recently. There's always someone decorating or renovating activity. We'd only move for more space.' Melek Melek lives next door to her daughter, Samiye, and her family. She moved to Goldsborough Road in 1968, from Putney, and was born in Cyprus. She's not as keen on leaving as her daughter. 'My husband never wanted to move, and since he died I find it quite hard to leave the memories. Everyone is nice, not just the old people. A young man came and knocked on the door the other day and said, \"Hello, I am so-and-so, I have just moved in.\" It's nice. I went to stay with my other daughter in Sidcup. Apart from the next-door neighbour, it seemed nobody cared about anybody. I got so depressed. People are warm and polite here. I wouldn't let it go easily.' Michael, Steve and Larry Michael is a chartered surveyor: 'I've lived here for eight months and I'm looking for my own flat in the street. It's friendly, there's no residents' parking, I like the ice-cream vans. In summer, the terraces hum with the buzz of people outside. It's homely.' Steve works in IT: 'I've lived here for three weeks. It's convenient and I really like the house.' Larry works in banking: 'I moved in two days ago. It's handy for Chelsea football ground and the West End. So far, so good.' Susan Susan is a liaison officer at King's College Hospital and has lived in two flats in the street. She was born in Walthamstow, the eldest of six children, but the family emigrated to Australia in 1963 and she's the only one to have come back (in 1968, aged 21). 'I think it's a lovely street and such a fantastic location. People say it's quiet, but they mean traffic. I like the human noises - they're comforting sounds. One day I'll go back to Australia to be with my parents, who are getting on, but I'll stay here until then.' Dominic, Jacqui and Alex Dominic and Jacqui lived in Sri Lanka and Ecuador before coming to Goldsborough Road five years ago. Says Dominic, a technology marketing manager for Motorola:'When we were looking for a property, our criteria were: it had to have a kitchen big enough to eat in and a roof terrace. Most estate agents just laughed. But here we are ... Within 24 hours of moving in, a neighbour had noticed we hadn't got any curtains and produced some.' Jacqui, an IT consultant, works from home and admits, 'I'm sure some people wouldn't like it. You're not anonymous.' With the arrival of their daughter, Alex, they needed more space than their upstairs flat afforded, but they didn't want to leave the street; it was a problem they solved quickly: 'We liked it so much we bought the downstairs.' Garri Garri runs a record label. 'I've lived here for 15 years and I don't know anybody. I'm quite shy, really. When I first came, the rent was \u00a336 a week, and it's still cheap. At first it felt very dangerous - there was a kind of crimewave in the mid-80s, but I soon became attached to the area. I love walking down the streets and not hearing English. There are Ethiopians, Portuguese ... they've transformed the local shops, and it's more alive.' We asked Garri if he thought he'd ever move - he replied that he'd been at home on the day of our grandmother's funeral. 'I watched the hearse pull out of the street and thought, \"One day that could be me being carted off.\" It wasn't a bad feeling.' Marjorie and Edward Marjorie and Edward moved to the street in 1946. Marjorie had come from Yorkshire. 'I thought London was the loneliest place on earth,' she says. Their flat remains largely unchanged, with its original fireplace and tongue-and-groove wood panelling in the front passage. 'There used to be a lot more children,' says Marjorie. 'They all played in the street, so you had to watch your windows! Crime wasn't a problem,' she adds. 'There was nothing to take.' Annette Annette fell in love with her flat straight away, but she is not so enamoured of the street since six months ago, when youths set fire to some rubbish bins.

'It's an island,' he says, taking us into his garden where, as if to prove the point, tropical plants flower. 'These are really conservatory plants, but it's so sheltered here.' He doesn't anticipate moving: 'It's cheap, safe, and so close to the centre of town.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Many of us have pored over the pages of interior magazines, dreaming of what it must be like to live inside some of the gorgeous homes in the photographs. Oh, to be in a pared-down, simplified environment, where all our belongings could be secreted away, only to be brought out when they were needed. </p> <p>Then reality kicks in, and we realise it's simply not possible. We cannot just get the kettle out of a cupboard every time we need a coffee; and while we like the variety of textures and materials available to the minimalist designer, we need more vibrant colours in our homes than variations on white and beige.</p> <p>Fortunately, the interior style popu-larly known as minimalism, which became fashionable more than a decade ago, has become more forgiving. Minimalism in 2000 allows us a more flexible environment: a balance between the freedom striven for by the philosophy and the practicalities of everyday living. We can all now have a taste of uncluttered paradise without sacrificing all homely comforts and expectations. </p> <p>The elegant work of architect Seth Stein is a good example. In one London house that Stein has designed, strong, vibrant colours are used to personalise the space. Here, with a touch of inspiration from Mexican architect Luis Barragan, a single arresting colour, offset by neutral textures, creates an electric glow that permeates through different rooms, giving a unique signature to this exquisite interior. </p> <p>But leaving aside what it looks like, this is an excellent and easy way to create a sense of space - the single colour being picked up in the next room, and so on. The light sources are unobtrusive, and provide a variety of different means of illuminating the separate parts of the house, so the overall effect is never too uniform. </p> <p>In his design for another London house, Stein has had to consider the occupier's affection for his cars - as well as the lack of outside parking. The result is a hydraulic lift in the accommodation area that enables the living space to double as storage for the car. This solution is ingenious, answering a rather demanding practical challenge. And while the mechanics that make this possible could be regarded as an unnecessary complication, the finesse with which they are executed result in a stunningly elegant, multipurpose room. </p> <p>The search for simple elegance in interior design has been a constant theme for many years. The Viennese architect Adolf Loos stated in his manifesto of 1908 that \"cultural evolution is equivalent to the removal of ornament from all articles of daily use\". Modernist hero Le Corbusier was quick to confirm this view. These aspirations were often socially motivated and of good intent, but it is extraordinarily challenging for most of us to jettison every last piece of decoration. In addition, the exacting details of minimalist designs become very expensive. For example, you cannot simply hide that awkward junction between plastered wall and floorboards with a simple piece of skirting board. Instead, you have to find and afford an expert plasterer and an extremely skilled carpenter to make sure this junction is perfectly executed. The extra time of the skilled craftsperson has to be added to the additional costs of the finest materials. </p> <p>Because the focus within the minimalist interior is often on the texture and unusual, excellent- quality materials, these materials are by definition pricey. This means that minimal style tends to be expensive and not accessible to all. Inevitably, though, as the style becomes increasingly popular, a more attainable version follows - just as haute couture is modified for high-street fashion. So the interior market strives to make interior design available for everyone. And so a more flexible, livable version of minimalism is evolving. </p> <p>Skirting boards are now acceptable, as are the odd superfluous decorative pieces - provided they are well-chosen and deliberately placed. Colours and curves are also now included. And while this dilutes the rigid minimalist ethos, it gives many more people the chance to experience the movement's ideals. </p> <p>In one apartment in New York, designed by Belmont Freeman, the amount of furniture and objects are kept at a fairly functional level, but there are some superfluous additions. Items such as vases filled with flowers only slightly encroach into the space, and yet add a slice of personalisation and beauty to an already spacious and relaxingly open room. Because of the large size of the space, each piece of furniture is carefully chosen and positioned to avoid cluttering and clashing. </p> <p>Good lighting is an essential feature for any aspect of interior design; minimalism is no exception. Gentle, diffuse lights are usually preferred, avoiding glare in the home. In houses with gardens, such as the town house pictured right, the lighting expertise is continued outside, linking indoors and outdoors. Here, the only division of the space is the large glass wall - dramatically increasing the sense of the size of the interior and heightening its feeling of flexibility. </p> <p>Gardens and adjoining exterior spaces can be utilised to great effect in expanding interiors. Of course, the larger the outside, then the more use it can be. Though not a domestic space, and smacking of unaffordable luxury, the garden of the Western Regina Hotel in California is a good example of the well-thought-out minimalist ideas. Here, the reflective quality of water is used to increase the feeling of space, while vivid colours and the confident, repetitive geometry of the concrete shapes and walls contrast with its stillness, and make for a lively scene. Meanwhile, \"windows\" in the walls offer a tantalising glimpse of unruly nature in the Baja desert beyond - infinity suggested by the unknown. </p> <p>The idea of a \"new minimalism\" does not challenge the brilliant minimalist designs of architects such as Claudio Silvestrin or John Pawson (whose interiors deservedly have an international following), but it does offer an affordable and relaxed method by which many more of us can capture some of that hypnotic, clutter-free essence.</p> <p>\u0095 Maggie Toy is editor of Architectural Design magazine.

      "bodyText": "Many of us have pored over the pages of interior magazines, dreaming of what it must be like to live inside some of the gorgeous homes in the photographs. Oh, to be in a pared-down, simplified environment, where all our belongings could be secreted away, only to be brought out when they were needed. Then reality kicks in, and we realise it's simply not possible. We cannot just get the kettle out of a cupboard every time we need a coffee; and while we like the variety of textures and materials available to the minimalist designer, we need more vibrant colours in our homes than variations on white and beige. Fortunately, the interior style popu-larly known as minimalism, which became fashionable more than a decade ago, has become more forgiving. Minimalism in 2000 allows us a more flexible environment: a balance between the freedom striven for by the philosophy and the practicalities of everyday living. We can all now have a taste of uncluttered paradise without sacrificing all homely comforts and expectations. The elegant work of architect Seth Stein is a good example. In one London house that Stein has designed, strong, vibrant colours are used to personalise the space. Here, with a touch of inspiration from Mexican architect Luis Barragan, a single arresting colour, offset by neutral textures, creates an electric glow that permeates through different rooms, giving a unique signature to this exquisite interior. But leaving aside what it looks like, this is an excellent and easy way to create a sense of space - the single colour being picked up in the next room, and so on. The light sources are unobtrusive, and provide a variety of different means of illuminating the separate parts of the house, so the overall effect is never too uniform. In his design for another London house, Stein has had to consider the occupier's affection for his cars - as well as the lack of outside parking. The result is a hydraulic lift in the accommodation area that enables the living space to double as storage for the car. This solution is ingenious, answering a rather demanding practical challenge. And while the mechanics that make this possible could be regarded as an unnecessary complication, the finesse with which they are executed result in a stunningly elegant, multipurpose room. The search for simple elegance in interior design has been a constant theme for many years. The Viennese architect Adolf Loos stated in his manifesto of 1908 that \"cultural evolution is equivalent to the removal of ornament from all articles of daily use\". Modernist hero Le Corbusier was quick to confirm this view. These aspirations were often socially motivated and of good intent, but it is extraordinarily challenging for most of us to jettison every last piece of decoration. In addition, the exacting details of minimalist designs become very expensive. For example, you cannot simply hide that awkward junction between plastered wall and floorboards with a simple piece of skirting board. Instead, you have to find and afford an expert plasterer and an extremely skilled carpenter to make sure this junction is perfectly executed. The extra time of the skilled craftsperson has to be added to the additional costs of the finest materials. Because the focus within the minimalist interior is often on the texture and unusual, excellent- quality materials, these materials are by definition pricey. This means that minimal style tends to be expensive and not accessible to all. Inevitably, though, as the style becomes increasingly popular, a more attainable version follows - just as haute couture is modified for high-street fashion. So the interior market strives to make interior design available for everyone. And so a more flexible, livable version of minimalism is evolving. Skirting boards are now acceptable, as are the odd superfluous decorative pieces - provided they are well-chosen and deliberately placed. Colours and curves are also now included. And while this dilutes the rigid minimalist ethos, it gives many more people the chance to experience the movement's ideals. In one apartment in New York, designed by Belmont Freeman, the amount of furniture and objects are kept at a fairly functional level, but there are some superfluous additions. Items such as vases filled with flowers only slightly encroach into the space, and yet add a slice of personalisation and beauty to an already spacious and relaxingly open room. Because of the large size of the space, each piece of furniture is carefully chosen and positioned to avoid cluttering and clashing. Good lighting is an essential feature for any aspect of interior design; minimalism is no exception. Gentle, diffuse lights are usually preferred, avoiding glare in the home. In houses with gardens, such as the town house pictured right, the lighting expertise is continued outside, linking indoors and outdoors. Here, the only division of the space is the large glass wall - dramatically increasing the sense of the size of the interior and heightening its feeling of flexibility. Gardens and adjoining exterior spaces can be utilised to great effect in expanding interiors. Of course, the larger the outside, then the more use it can be. Though not a domestic space, and smacking of unaffordable luxury, the garden of the Western Regina Hotel in California is a good example of the well-thought-out minimalist ideas. Here, the reflective quality of water is used to increase the feeling of space, while vivid colours and the confident, repetitive geometry of the concrete shapes and walls contrast with its stillness, and make for a lively scene. Meanwhile, \"windows\" in the walls offer a tantalising glimpse of unruly nature in the Baja desert beyond - infinity suggested by the unknown. The idea of a \"new minimalism\" does not challenge the brilliant minimalist designs of architects such as Claudio Silvestrin or John Pawson (whose interiors deservedly have an international following), but it does offer an affordable and relaxed method by which many more of us can capture some of that hypnotic, clutter-free essence. \u0095 Maggie Toy is editor of Architectural Design magazine.

First, you should never start eating before anyone else, although it's worth making a quiet check on whether they actually ordered a starter. Once you get started, you will often have more cutlery in front of you than you have in your drawer at home. The polite thing to do is make sure you use every single implement on every course, even if it's soup. After you've used an implement, store it in the little jug marked with the flower. </p> <p>At some stage, the waiter may bring a bottle of wine for your approval. The correct thing to do is to check the alcohol content - if it's lower than 15%, send it straight back. Once you've checked the alcohol content, they will pour a tiny amount into your glass. This is sheer meanness on their part. You've paid for it, so insist on a full glass. You can then go ahead and taste the wine. Just remember that spitting it out is the right thing to do and the correct receptacle for this is the ice bucket by the table of the romantic couple sitting next to you. </p> <p>Napkin-folding is one of the cornerstones of western civilisation, and staff in a good restaurant should be able to transform a damask napkin into a fully functioning stegosaurus in less time than it takes you to find the right end of an asparagus spear. Waiting staff are always happy to demonstrate this skill, so wait until they've spread it across your lap and then say you preferred it in its mating-duck form. There is often some confusion between a napkin and a serviette, and getting it wrong is a clear signal that you are as common as dirt. The golden rule is that where there is an even number dining, napkins are serviettes, and vice versa. </p> <p>Certain foods have for years provided a litmus test for social skills. For example, asking for two fishfingers is tantamount to slapping your host in the face. Similarly, taking a mouthful of alphabet soup without a vowel is wretchedly common. The ultimate challenge, of course, is lobster, when you're given a bowl and a pair of nutcrackers. It takes years of practice to find the lobster's nuts and then get them into the bowl, but socially it pays huge dividends.</p>",

Once you've checked the alcohol content, they will pour a tiny amount into your glass. This is sheer meanness on their part. You've paid for it, so insist on a full glass. You can then go ahead and taste the wine. Just remember that spitting it out is the right thing to do and the correct receptacle for this is the ice bucket by the table of the romantic couple sitting next to you. Napkin-folding is one of the cornerstones of western civilisation, and staff in a good restaurant should be able to transform a damask napkin into a fully functioning stegosaurus in less time than it takes you to find the right end of an asparagus spear. Waiting staff are always happy to demonstrate this skill, so wait until they've spread it across your lap and then say you preferred it in its mating-duck form. There is often some confusion between a napkin and a serviette, and getting it wrong is a clear signal that you are as common as dirt. The golden rule is that where there is an even number dining, napkins are serviettes, and vice versa. Certain foods have for years provided a litmus test for social skills. For example, asking for two fishfingers is tantamount to slapping your host in the face. Similarly, taking a mouthful of alphabet soup without a vowel is wretchedly common. The ultimate challenge, of course, is lobster, when you're given a bowl and a pair of nutcrackers. It takes years of practice to find the lobster's nuts and then get them into the bowl, but socially it pays huge dividends.",

      "body": "<p>I have always had a low opinion of my critics, but last weekend's shower, who decided that I was \"jealous\" of poor Paula Yates, left me cackling with glee. God, yes, how could I not have seen it all these years - forget Dorothy Parker in her prime or Ava Gardner at her peak: what I really, REALLY wanted all along was to be a suicidal, silicone-breasted, bleached-blonde, 40-year-old mother of four, adulterous spawn of Hughie Green and a Bluebell Girl, with a dead boyfriend, an even deader career and a habit of being sick into her handbag at public parties. What a deluded fool I've been. I'll try to rectify matters now that you've drawn it to my attention. Shall I start by cultivating a heroin habit, or by making myself unemployable? I'll reach that state of grace that is Pauladom by any means possible.</p> <p>A few days before, in this same newspaper, Charlotte Raven was accused of being \"jealous\" of Nigella Lawson simply for stating the obvious: that someone who spends so much time creating such an ostentatiously \"perfect\" life is obviously dealing with a good many demons. If anything, it was a new way of understanding and empathising with the Nigella Phenomenon, rather than writing her off as some sort of souped-up Proust'n'pashmina Stepford Wife. Apart from anything else, our combined critics are using the wrong word - they mean \"envious\". If we were \"jealous\" of Paula and Nigella, it would mean we coveted them sexually. And who'd dare say such a thing of such flagrantly heterosexual gals as Miss Raven and myself?</p> <p>I've noticed for a while now that when men criticise other men, not even the most immature observer will turn round and lisp, \"Oooh, you're jealous, Tom Bower - you're jealous of Richard Branson cos he's such a dish! And as for you, Michael Crick, stop being jealous of Jeffrey Archer, because he's such a better writer than you!\" When a woman criticises another, however, the geek chorus is always on hand to prolong the myth that the only reason one woman could find another not to her taste would be because she envied her. It's a pathetic point of view, and one more suitable for readers of the Daily Star, frankly.</p> <p>I don't think women are generally envious of other women. If they were, Jennifer Lopez wouldn't invariably be voted most beautiful woman in the world by other women. If we were uniformly green-eyed bitches, wouldn't we choose someone a bit more mundane, such as Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock? The antipathy to Big Brother's Melanie was read by some social critics as female antipathy to attractive women, but women despised Mel for one reason and one reason only - she was, personality-wise, a truly amazing combination of man-pleaser and control-freak, a hard double-punch to pull off, but one of spectacular awfulness when achieved. What sort of woman goes around letting men snog her, and then saying, \"You really shouldn't have done that\", as though she was somewhere else at the time? Surely this is no way for a grown-up female to conduct herself - but then, Mel was rather odd, in that she was a 28-year-old woman who dressed like a teenager and lived with her mother.</p> <p>Besides, Mel was never beautiful - she was \"attractive\", a thin gruel when placed beside actual beauty, Claire the Florist. And didn't Mel herself realise this, to judge by her hostile body language when the luscious giggler first bounced through the door of the Big Brother house! In my experience, it's your \"attractive\" women who can be most obsessed with the pecking order, as Mel proved. Beautiful girls and plain girls have pretty much sorted where they stand by the time they're 18, and cut their cloth accordingly, but the merely attractive girl spends her life feeling superior to the plain ones and inferior to the beautiful ones, and it can make her a bit of a bitch. Mind you, I don't say that disapprovingly - a touch of bitchiness can be the finishing touch in a woman, rendering pleasingly tart what might otherwise be wishy-washily bland.</p> <p>Reading Patrick Jephson's \"expos*\" of Diana, I could not believe the way some of the broadsheet harpies picked up on her tendency to swear, have affairs and laugh at dirty jokes as proof of her basic worthlessness. If we applied this strict no-sex-we're-saints criteria to men, everyone from Gandhi to Geldof would be out of the running as any sort of of hero. My favourite Diana moment has to be that much tutted-over time when she crept up behind the Legge-Bourke woman and whispered silkily, \"So sorry about the baby!\" Frankly, if someone has a double-barrelled name and thinks that being accused of having an abortion is anything to get upset about, they deserve what they get.</p> <p>Here, unusually, I think we did see in Diana's critics a touch of genuine girl-on-girl envy, albeit by a bunch of women who are motivated by a bourgeois form of class envy - \"If Charles had chosen me, little Lesley from Cheam, I'd have been a much better princess than that stuck-up bitch!\" - as much as anything. So, generally, women are not jealous of each other: how could the fashion rags sell as well if they were? Women don't buy them to look at the dreadful clothes, but rather to look at the beautiful models. Men are more envious of beautiful women than women are - envious generally, as well as jealous specifically, of any they may personally be in love with. This one's thick, that one's a gold-digger, the other one's a 'ho. When Eminem disses Christina Aguilera in that lisping little voice, say, I can't help but think of a drag queen made bitter by a real woman's breasts. And how do you explain the far greater ratio of male-to-female sex changes than female-to-male ones? Venus envy.</p> <p>You can't blame men for envying women; I just wish they'd be more honest about it, instead of covering it up with macho and strut. It's only natural to like us more. For instance, off the top of my head, I can think of a dozen women who are so pretty that they make me want to stand up and cheer whenever I see a photo of them - Mariella Frostrup, Tamzin Outhwaite, Martine McCutcheon, Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, Natalie (though not Nicole) Appleton, Tyra Banks, Kylie (still), Kate Moss, Frankie Rayder, Amanda Burton and Emmanuelle B*art - but I'd have to think long and hard before I could compile a list of men who make me feel the same way. Yet I think I know enough about myself by now to know that I am at least 95% heterosexual. This is why lesbianism makes so much more sense than male homosexuality. I find it far easier to appreciate the way that the loathsome Peter Stringfellow feels about women than I can understand the way the glorious George Michael feels about men. To be crude about it, you could call it the Scrotum Factor. I mean, who the hell can look at a scrotum and think, \"Wow!\"?</p>",

Yet an estimated two-thirds of children who work are doing so illegally and many others are ripped off by miserly employers who give less than the average rates of pay for jobs typically done by youngsters, according to new research from Abbey National.</p> <p>The average weekly pay for 10 to 16-year-olds is \u00a314.03. Girls earn an average \u00a32.75 per hour and boys \u00a31.93, largely because girls are more likely to do shop work which tends to be more highly paid, though in general girls are less likely to work than boys.</p> <p>One in three schoolchildren who work have more than one job. Half of all children who work have delivery jobs while almost one in five works in a shop.

      "bodyText": "Two million Brits aged 10 to 16 work part-time - two out of five children aged 10 or over and two out of three over-15s hold part-time jobs. Yet an estimated two-thirds of children who work are doing so illegally and many others are ripped off by miserly employers who give less than the average rates of pay for jobs typically done by youngsters, according to new research from Abbey National. The average weekly pay for 10 to 16-year-olds is \u00a314.03. Girls earn an average \u00a32.75 per hour and boys \u00a31.93, largely because girls are more likely to do shop work which tends to be more highly paid, though in general girls are less likely to work than boys. One in three schoolchildren who work have more than one job. Half of all children who work have delivery jobs while almost one in five works in a shop. Part-time jobs as cinema ushers, paying an average \u00a35 per hour, and as supermarket checkout operators at \u00a34.50 an hour, tend to be the best-paid positions to go for. Among the worst-paid are paperboys or girls, who earn \u00a37 a week, and chip shop assistants, who make just \u00a31.20 an hour, according to Abbey National. The national minimum wage does not apply to people under 18 and so pay tends to depend on local rates for the type of work, or on what can be negotiated with the employer. Some of the larger national companies make no distinction between under-18s and other part-time workers, nor do they differentiate between areas, although many pay extra if the job is in London. Most young people don't have to pay income tax on their wages because their total annual income does not exceed the personal tax allowance - \u00a34,385 for the tax year 2000-2001. And they will not be liable to pay National Insurance until they are 16; even then they must earn more than \u00a376 a week before they will have to pay. Many perks such as paid holiday and sick pay are not available to young people. Someone under school-leaving age (by law, a child ceases to be of compulsory school age on the last Friday in June in the school year in which they reach the age of 16) doesn't have a right to paid holidays, but are expected to take two weeks' break a year during a school holiday. Those aged 16 to 18 are slightly better off in being entitled to paid holiday pro rata, according to how often they work. So, for example, if ordinary workers get four weeks paid holiday, a Saturday worker should get four days paid holiday per year. Some types of job can bring extra perks which, if they are not offered, are always worth requesting. Someone working in a shop might ask for a discount on the products, for example, while people working in catering might ask for a share of tips and free meals. Of the high proportion of children working illegally, a quarter are under the minimum age, almost one in five starts work before 7am on a weekday and one in five works after 7pm in the evening, says Abbey National, which has published a free guide to make parents aware of their children's rights at work and how to protect them. Though children are obviously being exploited in such situations, parents can at least rest assured that it is the employer, not the child, who is breaking the law. The minimum age to start paid work is 14, though in some areas local authority by-laws allow 13-year-olds to do certain jobs such as delivering newspapers, serving in shops, working in hairdressing salons, offices, cafes and riding stables. Parents of 13-year-olds should check with their local council about what type of work is permitted. Once a young person reaches school-leaving age, there are very few restrictions on what they can do, although generally speaking, they must be over 18 to work in a bar. The law says that people of school age should only do \"light work\" and local authority by-laws may list certain jobs considered unsuitable for young people, such as working in commercial kitchens, nightclubs, betting shops and in businesses involved in selling door-to-door. Other jobs outlawed for under-16s include working in dangerous industries such as demolition, building, transport or manufacturing. \u0095 For a free copy of Abbey National's The Easy Guide to Your Kids' Rights at Work call 0800-917-6759.",

Several writers mentioned the marked difference they had observed in email sent directly to them and the correspondence about their work published on the letters page.

However, it does mean that in any year there are perhaps 90,000 readers who have suffered the frustration of failing to see their letters in print. The quality of the letters page might well suffer - there is no sign of this at the moment - if large numbers of readers simply decided to settle for private correspondence with the writer. </p> <p>It is quite important that those of you who are using the opportunity to email journalists directly ask yourselves whether you also want your letter to be considered for publication. If you do, then copy it, to <a href=\"mailto:letters@theguardian.com\">letters@theguardian.com</a> or, better, send another version to the letters page. The letters editor says that emails intended for publication are very often, as they need to be, more focused and briefer than the more relaxed and informal mail to the journalist. </p> <p>I mentioned that there were some reservations. Some journalists felt that the burden on their time, if they answered all their correspondence, was too great and interfered with their \"real work\". Several, particularly those receiving a lot of email, felt that in opening their office email addresses to you, the readers, they had surrendered their own privacy and ran the risk of losing important messages from colleagues, or the email from a partner asking them to pick up a pint of milk on the way home. </p> <p>Why not, they asked, have a parallel email system so that in-office emails and personal emails could be kept separate? There are practical difficulties in doing that, and to some extent it would work against the idea of direct access and accountability, which is what we are really talking about. I think these reservations will disappear in time. Email can be sifted extremely quickly, and those who receive it must simply answer what they can. In my experience most people are reasonable about this. The 100,000 letters to the editor received every year are not acknowledged.

      "body": "<p>The conductor Bernard Haitink is praised for many things, but his ability as an orator is not high on the list. While his reputation as a taciturn and somewhat introvert figure is slightly overplayed, it is nevertheless true that he has never been given to the grand dramatic gestures often favoured by other leaders of his profession. But despite this reticence, perhaps the few words he said two years ago to a packed Royal Albert Hall following a performance of G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, the final part of Wagner's Ring cycle, might be his longest lasting legacy to musical life in this country. </p> <p>The opera house at Covent Garden was closed for redevelopment and the company was homeless. The financial and political chaos had progressed from tragedy to farce and back again and it was seriously being suggested that the orchestra and chorus should be disbanded. Haitink offered his resignation on the reasonable grounds that there was little point in being music director if there was no music. </p> <p>\"The orchestra were extremely frightened and they asked John Tomlinson, who was singing Wotan, to say a few words,\" Haitink recalls. \"John thought about it and said no. He said let the music speak and I agreed with him.\" The phrase could have been made for Haitink but five and a half hours later, as much to his surprise as to everyone else's, he found himself walking towards the front of the stage. \"We are always accused of being elitist but there were 6,000 people there and it was quite an event. It felt the right moment so I said a few words. It was totally improvised and I can't even remember what they were now, but it seemed to help.\" </p> <p>Haitink urged the crowd to write to the department of culture in support of the orchestra and, as is sometimes the quirky way with British democracy, the next day the department was on the phone to him seeking a meeting. Assurances were made, his resignation was withdrawn and when the new Covent Garden chief executive, Michael Kaiser, joined a month later Haitink's position was confirmed. </p> <p>\"I knew it was crucial for Bernard to be here,\" says Kaiser. \"He is an important leader both artistically and spiritually. He is the conscience of the house and it would be no way to start by letting your conscience leave in the first week.\" Kaiser ensured the orchestra's future was made secure and Haitink committed himself to the house until 2002. </p> <p>It was a huge achievement and a graphic illustration of Haitink's commitment to music-making in Britain. He began in his native Holland, but since the mid-60s, first with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and now at the Royal Opera, he has been a linchpin of musical life in this country, and was awarded the KBE for services to music as far back as 1977. </p> <p>This evening Haitink conducts his first Tristan und Isolde at Covent Garden. The opera is a key challenge for any great conductor and it is something his admirers have long wanted him to do. Over the past 15 years there have been several false starts, but this production will mark the beginning of a long goodbye from Covent Garden. When it is revived in 2002 it will be the last thing he conducts there as music director. As such, the piece neatly frames his career. The first operatic work he conducted in Holland in 1957 was its Prelude and Liebestod. </p> <p>In that time, Haitink's reputation as a supreme exponent of Wagner has soared. Following Lohengrin and Parsifal, an initial stab at the four-opera Ring cycle was aborted in 1988. He eventually completed it in 1991, albeit in a production he was obviously not happy with. Jeremy Isaacs was general director of Covent Garden when it was staged. \"Bernard is a very honest man and therefore couldn't conceal what he felt about aspects of the production,\" says Isaacs. \"But he is also very loyal. And while he made his points about aircraft and battered saloon cars on stage, the music-making was wonderful. That said, I'm sure he enjoyed it more at the Albert Hall without any staging.\" </p> <p>Haitink had no such reservations about his Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg, first produced in 1993 and regularly revived ever since. It has been acclaimed as one the best Covent Garden productions since the war. Thomas Allen sang Beckmesser. \"It is head and shoulders the most exciting thing I've done in my career,\" he says. \"And so much of that is down to Bernard. It is not just Everest in front of you but the whole of the Himalayas. That Bernard exercises such control is just extraordinary.\" </p> <p>Haitink says he takes the Birgit Nilsson line on what is needed to take on Wagner - \"comfortable shoes\" - but more seriously he expresses some disquiet about performing the work. \"I am not a Wagner fanatic,\" he explains. \"He was an incredible man of the theatre but he will always be controversial. His work has great appeal to audiences, especially in German-speaking countries. He is regarded as their composer, which can be frightening.\" </p> <p>That Haitink should be so aware of these issues is unsurprising. He was born in Amsterdam in 1929 and his formative years were lived under the Nazi occupation. \"Of course it has marked my life. Strangely, in the second half of my life I have been more aware of what went on than I was even at the time. I was very young and many things passed me by. My family didn't suffer too much, but I had many friends who disappeared.\" </p> <p>In fact he, his parents and his elder brother and sister were extremely fortunate to have survived the war, considering that his mother, Anna, was half Jewish. She worked for the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise - the international French cultural institution - while his father, Willem, was a civil servant who eventually became a director of the Dutch electricity board. Willem Haitink was for a time held in a concentration camp in reprisal for the bombing of a National Socialist bookshop. </p> <p>\"They took 100 hostages and my father was one of them,\" Bernard recalls. \"He just disappeared and we didn't know what had happened to him for four weeks. Then we got a letter saying he was in a concentration camp.\" Haitink remembers the letter asking if young Bernard had received a score of Beethoven's Fidelio. \"We had never discussed any score but it was his code for saying that he was in the same situation as the prisoners in Fidelio.\" When he was released after three and a half months - \"on the mercy of the F\u00fchrer\" - he was so thin his son didn't recognise him. </p> <p>\"But for me the really worst memories were the days of the liberation,\" he continues. \"The confusion of hate and joy in the population made it like the Wild West. People did what they wanted and there was a great deal of revenge. All that sticks in the memory. Today, sitting comfortably in my chair drinking a glass of wine, I refuse to look at films or pictures of the Holocaust on television. I think that is awful and wrong. But while we must never forget these things, maybe we should now look forward. We can never experience what these people experienced, but perhaps there is also a danger that one wallows in the past.\" </p> <p>While he says all this made his approach to Wagner both late and problematic, from the outset he had a \"huge thirst\" for music, despite a \"very primitive\" music education. He took up the violin and virtually lived at the concert hall where he saw great conductors like Bruno Walter, Erich Kleiber and Otto Klemperer conduct. After leaving school he won a place at the Amsterdam conservatoire - despite misgivings, because his Jewish friends were excluded - but describes wanting to be a conductor as a \"very strange urge, as I didn't have the tools for it\". He ruefully adds that he eventually achieved his goal through a matter of luck and opportunity. </p> <p>\"I have a strange theory. If I had not lived through those awful times when so many talents were murdered - I'm not only thinking of the Jewish community but people killed at the front as well - there would have been many more available talents and I would not have become a conductor. When you start to think about it, it becomes a bit frightening. Why me? Why not they who were murdered?\" </p> <p>So is his current huge workload an attempt to ensure that he does not waste the opportunity he has been given? \"It is because I was a lazy pig then. When I think of my school years I am ashamed. I wasn't stupid but I just wasn't there. Half the time we were taught under our desks because of air raids. But even when things became normal I wasn't interested. Maybe this is why now, when I am over 70, that people always ask me why I work so hard. I have to make up for my lazy days.\" He says it is ironic that he read a lot of German literature during this period because he had a good German teacher. \"I also had a wonderful French teacher but after a year she was removed because she was Jewish.\" </p> <p>When he was 25 he won a place on the Netherlands radio station conductors' course, but it was deferred for a year and he was instructed to play violin with a radio orchestra. He is dismissive of his talents as a violinist and has said that if he hadn't become a conductor he would have ended up on the back desk of second violins in a small provincial orchestra. \"But I am very grateful for that year. It is important for a conductor to be within an orchestra and it helped me a lot.\" </p> <p>Bob St John Wright is chairman of the London Philharmonic Orchestra and played under Haitink when he was music director there in the 70s. He says, \"He is the ideal orchestral player's conductor. He understands the mentality of an orchestra and the potential tediousness of it. He understands because someone has done it to him and he is tuned in psychologically and emotionally into how a player thinks.\" </p> <p>Haitink was initially awarded a contract to conduct four radio concerts in Holland. His big break came in 1956 when Carlo Maria Giulini cancelled an appearance with the Concertgebouw orchestra in Amsterdam and Haitink replaced him for Cherubini's requiem. \"Once people think you are a talent then you are in their hands. But at that time I was a sleepwalker. I was told to do things and I did them. While I'm not a sleepwalker any more, I never was a chess player in respect of planning my career.\" </p> <p>The next elevation came in 1961 when the respected principal conductor of the Concertgebouw, Eduard van Beinum, died and Haitink was asked to take over, first jointly with another conductor and three years later on his own. He held the post until 1988. \"I was far too young,\" he says. \"It was terrible for myself and must have been bad for the orchestra because I really wasn't that great. But I had been noted down as a talent and at that time there were very few young conductors in Holland so I had to become that talent. It took a long time and I struggled, but I did survive.\" </p> <p>Haitink developed the orchestra's traditional expertise in Bruckner, Beethoven and Mahler, and extended the repertoire with much contemporary music, including a great deal of work by 20th-century Dutch composers. He describes himself as a strange combination of extreme insecurity and inner toughness. He says if a rehearsal ever goes badly, for whatever reason, he has a dogged stubbornness to correct it. \"I think that stub bornness saved the day for me. There are some things I would do differently in my career, but I would never become a dictator.\" </p> <p>Watching him conduct a rehearsal of Tristan at Covent Garden illustrates his collaborative approach. As the overwhelmingly luscious opening chords of the opera emerge - heard only by the mid-morning cleaning shift - so a black polo-shirted Haitink begins to work with his orchestra. He follows up many of his notes to the players with conciliatory asides - \"I hope you agree\", \"not much different I know\". He is also gently humorous. \"Come on, come on,\" he smilingly urges a violinist. \"You have a crescendo there, don't be shy.\" Another violinist is asked for a note to be \"more velvety. Like you are stroking a cat - unless you are allergic to cats\". </p> <p>Rien de Reede has been principal flute at the Concertgebouw since 1972. He says Haitink was never obsessed by absolute instrumental perfection, but more concerned with, \"the value behind the notes and the essence of the composition\". It has been said that while someone like, say, Herbert von Karajan would give you Karajan's Beethoven, Haitink would always strive to give you Beethoven's Beethoven. </p> <p>Haitink says that words are mostly peripheral to rehearsals. \"You can say all sorts of stupid things, but it is the music-making with your hands, with your face, with your musical personality, that is the important part. I always say to a young conductor that when you are at a performance you can't talk any more to the orchestra, you have to show them what you mean.\" </p> <p>Despite success in Amsterdam, for many years Haitink had a difficult relationship with sections of the musical establishment and the press in Holland. \"I was far too young when I took over and it took a long time to really take shape. I was always that young conductor who had so much luck, but now I am a bit above the fray.\" </p> <p>When he finally left the Concertgebouw in 1988 it was an acrimonious parting. His long-term ally, the highly respected artistic director Marius Flothius, had left in 1974. He was replaced by a former finance director of the orchestra, Hein van Royen, who reorganised sections against Haitink's wishes and made new recording arrangements. By the time Haitink resigned, just before the Concertgebouw's centenary season, their relationship had completely broken down. Only recently has the relationship been Haitink and the orchestra been re-established and he is now its honorary conductor. \"When he left, it was like when a marriage breaks up,\" says Rien de Reede. \"But now he is St Bernard in Holland. His 70th birthday was a big thing and when he comes back it is like when the Dutch swimmers at the Olympics come back with their gold medals.\" </p> <p>Haitink now says that his relationship with Holland is \"OK, although I don't live there any more. As long as I work in London I will live in London, but even if I wasn't working here I don't think I would go back to live in Holland.\" He still owns a family house by the sea there, but says it is exclusively occupied by his children. Haitink has five children from his first marriage to Marjolein Snijder and is now a grandfather. They first met at music school and married in 1956. She stayed in music as an accompanist to young singers. Haitink is fiercely protective of his families' privacy and has promised that he would never speak about any of them in either promotional material or in interviews. </p> <p>The marriage to Marjolein broke up in the late 70s. Haitink had two further comparatively short-lived marriages in the 80s and 90s, first to a cellist and then to a violinist from the Concertgebouw. He is now married to Patricia Bloomfield, who was a viola player at the Royal Opera before leaving to become a barrister. Thomas Allen is one observer who says Haitink has changed in recent years. \"It's as if he has come home within himself. He was actually always quite approachable professionally, but he doesn't let too many people close to him. Now he appears easier in his own skin and more relaxed. Pat has been very good for him.\" </p> <p>Patricia herself says that Haitink \"still has a tendency to worry about everything. That's the way he is.\" Together they are working on reducing his schedule to spend more time relaxing. He had emergency heart surgery in 1998 and, after a period of intense concern, found himself with an unexpected period freed from pressures: \"After the operation was something of a golden time.\" Haitink says he was nervous returning to work after three months. \"I was partly thinking that I should finish because I had been given a warning: I should have a simpler life. After the first rehearsal I called Patricia to pick me up and I told her I was very worried because I had started to like it again.\" </p> <p>They have a house in south-west France and another home in Switzerland where he enjoys walking and cycling. \"He loves to be on his bike, which he can't do much in London,\" Patricia explains. \"He says it is the only Dutch thing about him, but I'm not too sure.\" </p> <p>While Haitink was with the Concertgebouw he also became principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra - \"to some people's annoyance in Holland\" - a post he held until 1979. He is also a guest conductor with the Vienna and Berlin philharmonic orchestras, principal guest conductor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and music director of the European Union Youth Orchestra. </p> <p>As his reputation grew in the 70s he was invited, somewhat unexpectedly, to Glyndebourne where the LPO was the resident orchestra. \"Even though he was comparatively inexperienced in opera, it was a great coup to get him,\" says Glyndebourne's George Christie. Haitink says he \"really had no idea what opera entailed. But I was asked back, despite some near disasters.\" He was made director of the festival in 1978. Thomas Allen sang in Haitink's first production there and remembers him as being \"jittery. He tends to be a worrier and if anything goes wrong he could sink into a dark Dutch mood. But the musical structure of the pieces was wonderful and he has since become much more of a theatre man.\" </p> <p>Haitink says Glyndebourne was \"very endearing, especially with the old house, although no-one misses it now. One of the main qualities was that you had time to rehearse. But you were more or less imprisoned in Sussex, which sometimes was nice and sometimes horrible.\" </p> <p>After his initial apprehensions about opera it was the 1976 production of Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress that convinced Haitink of the possibilities of the form. It was directed by John Cox and designed by David Hockney. \"It was a real breakthrough. For the first time I saw you could make real music in the pit in collaboration with the stage.\" It was Hockney's first opera. \"I felt my duty was to the music and I think Bernard sensed that,\" he says. \"Now I know that not all designers and directors are like that, but my number-one rule was 'don't fuck up the music'. It's not the job of a set designer to make an opera come alive. That's the job of the music.\" </p> <p>It seems slightly odd for Haitink, who appears to be instinctively democratic, to have worked for so long at institutions like Glyndebourne and Covent Garden, with their largely elite audiences. \"We always said that the best time at Glyndebourne was the preparation time before the first night and the arrival of the audience. But there was always a very knowledgeable core audience. They did appreciate the quality.\" He says that opera attracts all sorts, \"and not only the best sort. Especially nowadays with the whole corporate thing. Sometimes you wonder why they come\" </p> <p>He claims now to be a bit tired of the elitist tag at Covent Garden. \"Yes there are very expensive seats and that doesn't necessarily attract the right people, but there are also less expensive seats. But it is not all about seat prices: Covent Garden does extensive education work. I do wonder when I have finished how I will see the place.\" </p> <p>He was asked twice before he agreed to become music director, and will have stayed six years longer than he expected when he leaves in 2002. John Tooley was the general director who appointed him in 1988. \"He was not the obvious choice because he had limited operatic experience, but what we needed was a first-rate musician and a first-rate orchestra trainer. The orchestra was beginning to need the discipline that Bernard could bring and he has produced astonishing musical results.\" </p> <p>Jeremy Isaacs, with whom Haitink was said to have a cool relationship, also praises his generosity: \"He had the most benevolent attitude to other conductors and absolutely no selfishness. He even came and watched other leading conductors to see how they handled the orchestra. This is highly unusual and has been hugely beneficial to the house as a whole.\" </p> <p>In recent years it has seemed as if he could do no wrong, but earlier in his time at Covent Garden there was criticism, particularly of his handling of the Italian repertoire. George Christie at Glyndebourne says that he was never completely at home with Verdi. \"It is the best kind of roast beef; it is good and red and strong while at the same time it is tender. Bernard didn't seem to quite get it and it could all be a bit symphonic.\" After an ill-conceived production of Il Trovatore at Covent Garden he was actually booed - albeit by a tiny minority - when he came on stage at the end. </p> <p>Any doubts as to his theatrical abilities were killed off by the triumph of Meistersinger, and as the company slipped into its seemingly endless turmoil in the late 90s so Haitink's moral authority became an increasingly important beacon of hope. \"I always wanted to bring the company through these awful times as alive as possible.\" </p> <p>He says that during the closure mistakes were made as people started to panic. \"They were like rabbits i n front of a headlight. Someone then suggested blowing the whole thing up and starting from scratch. On paper that is a sensible idea if you are in industry, but music doesn't work that way.\" He says only experience enabled them to get through a chaotic opening night and initial season in the refurbished building. </p> <p>Haitink praises what Michael Kaiser has done at the house as \"a miracle. He has put the company on a healthy footing again\", and welcomes changes, such as the introduction of surtitles. \"When we were trying them out I could tell within minutes whether they were on or not. If no surtitles then death behind my back. Nothing. With surtitles people would react and that persuaded me. And let's face it, sometimes opera librettos are so idiotic people need a bit of help.\" </p> <p>When he finishes at Covent Garden it will by no means be the end of his career. He has contractual links with orchestras in Boston and Berlin. But first is Tristan. \"He is equipped to give the performance of his life,\" says Jeremy Isaacs. The bass Gwynne Howell, who has sung at Covent Garden for more than 25 years, agrees that Haitink has the scope to encompass this huge work. \"If you run a marathon before you're ready it is a nightmare,\" he says. \"But running it when you're prepared means you can relax a bit, accelerate when needed, be in control. It is still a huge challenge, but it is one he can meet.\" </p> <p>Patricia Haitink acknowledges the scale of the piece. \"He is frightened of it physically as well as artistically. Two conductors died doing it in the early days.\" It is an enormously demanding task to conduct an 80-strong orchestra for four and half hours - Haitink's score is the size of a breeze block. \"Bernard recently did the Prelude and Liebestod in a concert,\" continues Patricia. \"That's about 20 minutes of music, and at the end he said he was exhausted. One of his strong points is that he knows how to pace a performance. He knows where the top of the arc comes and that will help him physically.\" </p> <p>The two conductors Patricia referred to were Felix Mottl, one of Wagner's pupils and a great Wagner and Bruckner conductor, who died in Munich in 1911; and the great Joseph Keilberth, who also died in mid-performance in Munich in 1968. According to von Karajan, they both died in Act 3 - the act in which Tristan himself dies - and at approximately the same point in the score. </p> <p>Haitink hasn't yet decided whether to continue with opera after he leaves Covent Garden, despite his successor, Antonio Pappano, extending an invitation to return. \"There's no reason not to come back, but I don't know what my life will be like then. When you are in your 70s you start to think how long can you do it.\" </p> <p>He concedes that he is trying to get a little more philosophical - to accept that in life \"things come to an end. The most difficult things in my life are planning-meetings. I get glazed eyes when they give me a date in 2004. It is an awful thing in this profession that you have to plan so far ahead. At my age it is a bit cruel. But as long as I am mentally and physically able to conduct, I think I will want to do it.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Tristan und Isolde is at the Royal Opera from tonight, and on Radio 3 on November 9.</p> <p><strong> Life at a glance </strong></p> <p><strong>Bernard Johann Herman Haitink</strong> </p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> March 4 1929. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Amsterdam Conservatory; Netherlands Radio Union conductors' course. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> 1956 Marjolein Snijder, (three daughters, two sons);1994 Patricia Bloomfield. </p> <p><strong> Career: </strong> violinist Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra 1954; conducto NRP and other orchestras in Holland 1955-61; joint conductor Concertgebouw Orchestra, Amsterdam 1961-64, principal conductor Concertgebouw 1964-88; principal conductor London Philharmonic Orchestra 1967-79; musical director Glyndebourne Opera 1978-88; music director Royal Opera House 1987-; director European Union Youth Orchestra 1994 - present; principal guest conductor Boston Symphony Orchestra 1995 - . </p> <p><strong> Honours:</strong> Chevalier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres 1972; Honorary KBE 1977.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The conductor Bernard Haitink is praised for many things, but his ability as an orator is not high on the list. While his reputation as a taciturn and somewhat introvert figure is slightly overplayed, it is nevertheless true that he has never been given to the grand dramatic gestures often favoured by other leaders of his profession. But despite this reticence, perhaps the few words he said two years ago to a packed Royal Albert Hall following a performance of G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, the final part of Wagner's Ring cycle, might be his longest lasting legacy to musical life in this country. The opera house at Covent Garden was closed for redevelopment and the company was homeless. The financial and political chaos had progressed from tragedy to farce and back again and it was seriously being suggested that the orchestra and chorus should be disbanded. Haitink offered his resignation on the reasonable grounds that there was little point in being music director if there was no music. \"The orchestra were extremely frightened and they asked John Tomlinson, who was singing Wotan, to say a few words,\" Haitink recalls. \"John thought about it and said no. He said let the music speak and I agreed with him.\" The phrase could have been made for Haitink but five and a half hours later, as much to his surprise as to everyone else's, he found himself walking towards the front of the stage. \"We are always accused of being elitist but there were 6,000 people there and it was quite an event. It felt the right moment so I said a few words. It was totally improvised and I can't even remember what they were now, but it seemed to help.\" Haitink urged the crowd to write to the department of culture in support of the orchestra and, as is sometimes the quirky way with British democracy, the next day the department was on the phone to him seeking a meeting. Assurances were made, his resignation was withdrawn and when the new Covent Garden chief executive, Michael Kaiser, joined a month later Haitink's position was confirmed. \"I knew it was crucial for Bernard to be here,\" says Kaiser. \"He is an important leader both artistically and spiritually. He is the conscience of the house and it would be no way to start by letting your conscience leave in the first week.\" Kaiser ensured the orchestra's future was made secure and Haitink committed himself to the house until 2002. It was a huge achievement and a graphic illustration of Haitink's commitment to music-making in Britain. He began in his native Holland, but since the mid-60s, first with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and now at the Royal Opera, he has been a linchpin of musical life in this country, and was awarded the KBE for services to music as far back as 1977. This evening Haitink conducts his first Tristan und Isolde at Covent Garden. The opera is a key challenge for any great conductor and it is something his admirers have long wanted him to do. Over the past 15 years there have been several false starts, but this production will mark the beginning of a long goodbye from Covent Garden. When it is revived in 2002 it will be the last thing he conducts there as music director. As such, the piece neatly frames his career. The first operatic work he conducted in Holland in 1957 was its Prelude and Liebestod. In that time, Haitink's reputation as a supreme exponent of Wagner has soared. Following Lohengrin and Parsifal, an initial stab at the four-opera Ring cycle was aborted in 1988. He eventually completed it in 1991, albeit in a production he was obviously not happy with. Jeremy Isaacs was general director of Covent Garden when it was staged. \"Bernard is a very honest man and therefore couldn't conceal what he felt about aspects of the production,\" says Isaacs. \"But he is also very loyal. And while he made his points about aircraft and battered saloon cars on stage, the music-making was wonderful. That said, I'm sure he enjoyed it more at the Albert Hall without any staging.\" Haitink had no such reservations about his Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg, first produced in 1993 and regularly revived ever since. It has been acclaimed as one the best Covent Garden productions since the war. Thomas Allen sang Beckmesser. \"It is head and shoulders the most exciting thing I've done in my career,\" he says. \"And so much of that is down to Bernard. It is not just Everest in front of you but the whole of the Himalayas. That Bernard exercises such control is just extraordinary.\" Haitink says he takes the Birgit Nilsson line on what is needed to take on Wagner - \"comfortable shoes\" - but more seriously he expresses some disquiet about performing the work. \"I am not a Wagner fanatic,\" he explains. \"He was an incredible man of the theatre but he will always be controversial. His work has great appeal to audiences, especially in German-speaking countries. He is regarded as their composer, which can be frightening.\" That Haitink should be so aware of these issues is unsurprising. He was born in Amsterdam in 1929 and his formative years were lived under the Nazi occupation. \"Of course it has marked my life. Strangely, in the second half of my life I have been more aware of what went on than I was even at the time. I was very young and many things passed me by. My family didn't suffer too much, but I had many friends who disappeared.\" In fact he, his parents and his elder brother and sister were extremely fortunate to have survived the war, considering that his mother, Anna, was half Jewish. She worked for the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise - the international French cultural institution - while his father, Willem, was a civil servant who eventually became a director of the Dutch electricity board. Willem Haitink was for a time held in a concentration camp in reprisal for the bombing of a National Socialist bookshop. \"They took 100 hostages and my father was one of them,\" Bernard recalls. \"He just disappeared and we didn't know what had happened to him for four weeks. Then we got a letter saying he was in a concentration camp.\" Haitink remembers the letter asking if young Bernard had received a score of Beethoven's Fidelio. \"We had never discussed any score but it was his code for saying that he was in the same situation as the prisoners in Fidelio.\" When he was released after three and a half months - \"on the mercy of the F\u00fchrer\" - he was so thin his son didn't recognise him. \"But for me the really worst memories were the days of the liberation,\" he continues. \"The confusion of hate and joy in the population made it like the Wild West. People did what they wanted and there was a great deal of revenge. All that sticks in the memory. Today, sitting comfortably in my chair drinking a glass of wine, I refuse to look at films or pictures of the Holocaust on television. I think that is awful and wrong. But while we must never forget these things, maybe we should now look forward. We can never experience what these people experienced, but perhaps there is also a danger that one wallows in the past.\" While he says all this made his approach to Wagner both late and problematic, from the outset he had a \"huge thirst\" for music, despite a \"very primitive\" music education. He took up the violin and virtually lived at the concert hall where he saw great conductors like Bruno Walter, Erich Kleiber and Otto Klemperer conduct. After leaving school he won a place at the Amsterdam conservatoire - despite misgivings, because his Jewish friends were excluded - but describes wanting to be a conductor as a \"very strange urge, as I didn't have the tools for it\". He ruefully adds that he eventually achieved his goal through a matter of luck and opportunity. \"I have a strange theory.

Why not they who were murdered?\" So is his current huge workload an attempt to ensure that he does not waste the opportunity he has been given? \"It is because I was a lazy pig then.

Only recently has the relationship been Haitink and the orchestra been re-established and he is now its honorary conductor. \"When he left, it was like when a marriage breaks up,\" says Rien de Reede. \"But now he is St Bernard in Holland. His 70th birthday was a big thing and when he comes back it is like when the Dutch swimmers at the Olympics come back with their gold medals.\" Haitink now says that his relationship with Holland is \"OK, although I don't live there any more. As long as I work in London I will live in London, but even if I wasn't working here I don't think I would go back to live in Holland.\" He still owns a family house by the sea there, but says it is exclusively occupied by his children. Haitink has five children from his first marriage to Marjolein Snijder and is now a grandfather. They first met at music school and married in 1956. She stayed in music as an accompanist to young singers. Haitink is fiercely protective of his families' privacy and has promised that he would never speak about any of them in either promotional material or in interviews. The marriage to Marjolein broke up in the late 70s. Haitink had two further comparatively short-lived marriages in the 80s and 90s, first to a cellist and then to a violinist from the Concertgebouw. He is now married to Patricia Bloomfield, who was a viola player at the Royal Opera before leaving to become a barrister. Thomas Allen is one observer who says Haitink has changed in recent years. \"It's as if he has come home within himself. He was actually always quite approachable professionally, but he doesn't let too many people close to him. Now he appears easier in his own skin and more relaxed. Pat has been very good for him.\" Patricia herself says that Haitink \"still has a tendency to worry about everything. That's the way he is.\" Together they are working on reducing his schedule to spend more time relaxing. He had emergency heart surgery in 1998 and, after a period of intense concern, found himself with an unexpected period freed from pressures: \"After the operation was something of a golden time.\" Haitink says he was nervous returning to work after three months. \"I was partly thinking that I should finish because I had been given a warning: I should have a simpler life. After the first rehearsal I called Patricia to pick me up and I told her I was very worried because I had started to like it again.\" They have a house in south-west France and another home in Switzerland where he enjoys walking and cycling. \"He loves to be on his bike, which he can't do much in London,\" Patricia explains. \"He says it is the only Dutch thing about him, but I'm not too sure.\" While Haitink was with the Concertgebouw he also became principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra - \"to some people's annoyance in Holland\" - a post he held until 1979. He is also a guest conductor with the Vienna and Berlin philharmonic orchestras, principal guest conductor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and music director of the European Union Youth Orchestra. As his reputation grew in the 70s he was invited, somewhat unexpectedly, to Glyndebourne where the LPO was the resident orchestra. \"Even though he was comparatively inexperienced in opera, it was a great coup to get him,\" says Glyndebourne's George Christie. Haitink says he \"really had no idea what opera entailed. But I was asked back, despite some near disasters.\" He was made director of the festival in 1978. Thomas Allen sang in Haitink's first production there and remembers him as being \"jittery. He tends to be a worrier and if anything goes wrong he could sink into a dark Dutch mood. But the musical structure of the pieces was wonderful and he has since become much more of a theatre man.\" Haitink says Glyndebourne was \"very endearing, especially with the old house, although no-one misses it now. One of the main qualities was that you had time to rehearse. But you were more or less imprisoned in Sussex, which sometimes was nice and sometimes horrible.\" After his initial apprehensions about opera it was the 1976 production of Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress that convinced Haitink of the possibilities of the form. It was directed by John Cox and designed by David Hockney. \"It was a real breakthrough. For the first time I saw you could make real music in the pit in collaboration with the stage.\" It was Hockney's first opera. \"I felt my duty was to the music and I think Bernard sensed that,\" he says. \"Now I know that not all designers and directors are like that, but my number-one rule was 'don't fuck up the music'. It's not the job of a set designer to make an opera come alive. That's the job of the music.\" It seems slightly odd for Haitink, who appears to be instinctively democratic, to have worked for so long at institutions like Glyndebourne and Covent Garden, with their largely elite audiences. \"We always said that the best time at Glyndebourne was the preparation time before the first night and the arrival of the audience. But there was always a very knowledgeable core audience. They did appreciate the quality.\" He says that opera attracts all sorts, \"and not only the best sort. Especially nowadays with the whole corporate thing. Sometimes you wonder why they come\" He claims now to be a bit tired of the elitist tag at Covent Garden. \"Yes there are very expensive seats and that doesn't necessarily attract the right people, but there are also less expensive seats. But it is not all about seat prices: Covent Garden does extensive education work. I do wonder when I have finished how I will see the place.\" He was asked twice before he agreed to become music director, and will have stayed six years longer than he expected when he leaves in 2002. John Tooley was the general director who appointed him in 1988. \"He was not the obvious choice because he had limited operatic experience, but what we needed was a first-rate musician and a first-rate orchestra trainer. The orchestra was beginning to need the discipline that Bernard could bring and he has produced astonishing musical results.\" Jeremy Isaacs, with whom Haitink was said to have a cool relationship, also praises his generosity: \"He had the most benevolent attitude to other conductors and absolutely no selfishness. He even came and watched other leading conductors to see how they handled the orchestra. This is highly unusual and has been hugely beneficial to the house as a whole.\" In recent years it has seemed as if he could do no wrong, but earlier in his time at Covent Garden there was criticism, particularly of his handling of the Italian repertoire. George Christie at Glyndebourne says that he was never completely at home with Verdi. \"It is the best kind of roast beef; it is good and red and strong while at the same time it is tender. Bernard didn't seem to quite get it and it could all be a bit symphonic.\" After an ill-conceived production of Il Trovatore at Covent Garden he was actually booed - albeit by a tiny minority - when he came on stage at the end. Any doubts as to his theatrical abilities were killed off by the triumph of Meistersinger, and as the company slipped into its seemingly endless turmoil in the late 90s so Haitink's moral authority became an increasingly important beacon of hope. \"I always wanted to bring the company through these awful times as alive as possible.\" He says that during the closure mistakes were made as people started to panic. \"They were like rabbits i n front of a headlight. Someone then suggested blowing the whole thing up and starting from scratch. On paper that is a sensible idea if you are in industry, but music doesn't work that way.\" He says only experience enabled them to get through a chaotic opening night and initial season in the refurbished building. Haitink praises what Michael Kaiser has done at the house as \"a miracle. He has put the company on a healthy footing again\", and welcomes changes, such as the introduction of surtitles. \"When we were trying them out I could tell within minutes whether they were on or not. If no surtitles then death behind my back. Nothing. With surtitles people would react and that persuaded me. And let's face it, sometimes opera librettos are so idiotic people need a bit of help.\" When he finishes at Covent Garden it will by no means be the end of his career. He has contractual links with orchestras in Boston and Berlin. But first is Tristan. \"He is equipped to give the performance of his life,\" says Jeremy Isaacs. The bass Gwynne Howell, who has sung at Covent Garden for more than 25 years, agrees that Haitink has the scope to encompass this huge work. \"If you run a marathon before you're ready it is a nightmare,\" he says. \"But running it when you're prepared means you can relax a bit, accelerate when needed, be in control. It is still a huge challenge, but it is one he can meet.\" Patricia Haitink acknowledges the scale of the piece. \"He is frightened of it physically as well as artistically. Two conductors died doing it in the early days.\" It is an enormously demanding task to conduct an 80-strong orchestra for four and half hours - Haitink's score is the size of a breeze block. \"Bernard recently did the Prelude and Liebestod in a concert,\" continues Patricia. \"That's about 20 minutes of music, and at the end he said he was exhausted. One of his strong points is that he knows how to pace a performance. He knows where the top of the arc comes and that will help him physically.\" The two conductors Patricia referred to were Felix Mottl, one of Wagner's pupils and a great Wagner and Bruckner conductor, who died in Munich in 1911; and the great Joseph Keilberth, who also died in mid-performance in Munich in 1968. According to von Karajan, they both died in Act 3 - the act in which Tristan himself dies - and at approximately the same point in the score. Haitink hasn't yet decided whether to continue with opera after he leaves Covent Garden, despite his successor, Antonio Pappano, extending an invitation to return. \"There's no reason not to come back, but I don't know what my life will be like then. When you are in your 70s you start to think how long can you do it.\" He concedes that he is trying to get a little more philosophical - to accept that in life \"things come to an end. The most difficult things in my life are planning-meetings. I get glazed eyes when they give me a date in 2004. It is an awful thing in this profession that you have to plan so far ahead. At my age it is a bit cruel. But as long as I am mentally and physically able to conduct, I think I will want to do it.\" \u0095 Tristan und Isolde is at the Royal Opera from tonight, and on Radio 3 on November 9.

Sadly, that popularity brings extra pressure, and increasing, though illegal, use by cyclists causes concern. Areas which have been close-felled of conifers and sycamores for re-planting with native broadleaves are easily accessible, and the resultant wear and compaction of the woodland soils affects the regeneration of ground flora. Grass Wood is particularly noted for its flowering plants such as lily-of-the-valley, rock rose, burnet rose, bloody crane's bill and other rarer species. The lottery money, together with a grant from the Hanson Group via the landfill tax credit scheme, will pay for contractors and the training of volunteers to help execute the work programme.It is, however, volunteer workers who are needed, to complete this ambitious project. Volunteer time also counts as matched funding which releases extra lottery moneys. To return a 250-acre wood to as near a natural state as practical is extremely labour intensive, but the end result will be well worth the effort.",

      "body": "<p>Why are violins made by Antonio Stradivari, the 18th-century instrument maker, so dramatically better than anything built since? Instrument makers have patiently disassembled his violins and replicated the measurements exactly in new instruments. Physicists have used lab equipment to analyse the vibrational patterns of the front and back plates, which generate most of the sound, and had craftsmen carve new plates that faithfully reproduce the patterns. Chemists have cooked up recipes for the varnish that coats a violin's raw maple and spruce. Yet nothing duplicated the transcendently beautiful sounds of the violins made by Stradivari, and his Cremonese contemporaries Nicolo Amati and Giuseppe Guarneri. </p> <p>But Joseph Nagyvary, 66, a biochemist at Texas A&amp;M University, may have found the answer. Nagyvary, who also makes violins, violas and cellos, believes the chemists were closest to the truth. He says it is the varnish, together with the specially treated spruce, that makes Cremonese violins great. Neither had much to do with Stradivari. The local lumberman happened to supply him with the ideal wood, and the local apothecary with the perfect varnish. \"Stradivari was a marvellous craftsman,\" Nagyvary observes, \"but the magnificent sound of his instruments is a lucky accident.\" </p> <p>Nagyvary's historical research yielded a crucial clue. According to an account by the aristocratic patron of Joannes Baptista Guadagnini, one of the last of the great Cremonese violin makers, it was important to use wood that had been dry-aged, with no extra treatment. Nagyvary was not convinced. \"I think this may have been a deliberate deception,\" he says, \"in order to keep anyone from copying the great masters and lowering the value of existing instruments.\" </p> <p>He learned that the wood supplies were tightly controlled at the time by the government authorities in Venice: \"If you just went out and cut wood from the forests, you could be thrown in jail.\" Instead, authorised woodcutters felled trees in the highlands and dumped logs into rivers, where they were carried downstream to their destination. </p> <p>\"The Venetian navy got the best wood for building its ships,\" Nagyvary says. \"Only after bureaucrats had taken inventory and assessed taxes could wood merchants buy their supplies, and at this point, the wood had been sitting in water for weeks or even months.\" Sure enough, Nagyvary says, when he took electron micrographs of a handful of wood shavings from Cremonese instruments, residues of bacteria and fungi showed up, just as you'd expect in wood that's been sitting in water. </p> <p>Using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, Nagyvary also found the slivers contained unusually large amounts of minerals, including potassium, sodium, aluminum, copper, iron and especially calcium and magnesium. Some might have been drawn from brackish water in Venetian lagoons, but the rest, Nagyvary decided, were probably the result of deliberately treating the wood with mineral solutions. This was not a preposterous notion: alchemy books (the chemistry texts of the day) had many recipes for mineral-rich wood preservatives used by furniture makers to protect chairs and tables against damage from insects and against rot. </p> <p>Nagyvary began soaking chunks of spruce and maple in brews of preservative chemicals. He knew that some woodworkers soaked their lumber in solutions containing bovine dung and urine. So he put up a sign above a tub in a men's room in the biochemistry lab: \"Please contribute generously to violin research.\" </p> <p>He kept experimenting and in 1975 went to Cremona, where he talked a violin maker into building some instruments with his treated wood. This raised the question of the varnishing of the finished instruments. Physicists who study the vibrational qualities of wood say varnish as little as possible: varnish adds weight, keeping the fiddle from vibrating to its full potential. Nonsense, say many violin makers: varnish is essential to the beauty of a violin, and the secrets of the varnish are jealously guarded. </p> <p>Many violin makers swear by oil-based varnishes; Nagyvary asserts that their instruments would be better off bare. \"First the oil penetrates deep into the wood. Then it dries and becomes gummy. That dampens down the vibrations.\" </p> <p>On the most pristine surviving Stradivarius violins, by contrast, the finish has a brittle, almost glassy look. \"It's like a toffee apple,\" says Nagyvary. He believes that there are good reasons for this. A toffee apple's surface is hard and shiny because the molecules that make up its sugar coating link to form long, interlocked chains. If the Stradivarius varnish contained sugar or a polysaccharide, the molecules would have attached to one another and to the wood, stiffening it so it could vibrate more efficiently, the opposite of what happens with oil. </p> <p>Nagyvary found support for his belief in 16th-century documents noting that wood finishes frequently contained powdered glass, porcelain or amber to add stiffness to the wood and make the finish glitter like a gem, and that fruit-tree extracts were widely used in wood varnishes. </p> <p>\"This makes perfect sense,\" he says. \"The pectin creates beautiful polymers. It's what makes jellies jell.\" He picks up a beaker filled with a solution of gum from the guar plant. He adds borax, \"in this mixture it acts as a cross-linker, weaving the chains of sugar molecules into a web\". Suddenly, the liquid solidifies into a gelatinous mass. \"We need an emulsifier, to make it fluid enough to work into the wood. I like to use ox-bile.\" He also adds quartz, amber, gypsum, coral, zinc and powdered ruby and sapphire. By the time he's ready to apply the mixture to the instruments he makes, it has the consistency of mayonnaise. </p> <p>The test is in the playing, and Nagyvary claims that his lab tests show the sound patterns of his instruments match those of the best Stradivari. He and his colleagues have compiled an extensive database from which they can tell a great violin from a mediocre one. Their test is the pattern of frequencies they see on their computer screen. </p> <p>\"It turns out that the violins acknowledged to be great by expert listeners all look similar on the sound analyser,\" Nagyvary says. \"And the pattern almost exactly reproduces that of the human voice.\" </p> <p>\u00a9 2000 Discover magazine</p>",

      "body": "<p>His paintings show a serene world peopled by obese - yet elegant - figures in dreamlike scenes far removed from the drug-fuelled violence that wracks his homeland. </p> <p>Now artist Fernando Botero is sending a huge collection of artworks back to his native Colombia, even though he feels it is too unsafe to live there full-time himself. </p> <p>The donation, said to be valued at more than $100m (\u00a368m), includes some 200 works by Botero, and nearly 100 pieces by others from his own collection, which includes Monet, Picasso, Dali and Bacon. </p> <p>They are to be shown at museums in Bogota and a purpose-built gallery in Medellin, city of his birth. \"It was a way to help Colombia and a way to change the face of Medellin,\" said Botero. \"We wanted to show that it's not just the city of the cartels, assassins, death and crime..\" </p> <p>Until recently, Botero's art ignored Colombia's endemic violence, but earlier this year, the painter sparked controversy when he unveiled a new collection portraying the turmoil of crime and war. </p> <p>One picture shows drug baron Pablo Escobar dying in a hail of police bullets. In another, Manuel \"Sureshot\" Marulanda, legendary leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), stands calmly in a jungle clearing, carrying a strangely harmless-looking machine gun. </p> <p>Other paintings in the series include the aftermath of a car-bomb attack, a group of guerrillas resting in a forest and a massacre in a bar. </p> <p>Why did he break his own rules? \"Art should be an oasis, a place or refuge from the hardness of life,\" he explained. \"But the Colombian drama is so out of proportion that today you cannot ignore the violence, the thousands of displaced and dead, the processions of coffins. Against all my principles I had to paint [the violence].\" </p> <p>The paintings are oddly peaceful. In the Escobar portrait, the bullets seem frozen in mid-air. The drug baron's only wound is a tiny spot of blood, when in reality, he was practically torn apart by gunfire. </p> <p>When the paintings were released in July, some Colombians said the works glorified notorious outlaws. \"He has the complete right to immortalise whomever he wants,\" said an editorial in the Cali newspaper, El Pais. \"However, one is left with a certain unease.\" </p> <p>Botero insists that no moral judgment was intended. \"It wasn't a homage, I was giving testimony on people who are central to Colombian life ... In the US, there are films and books about Al Capone, but that doesn't mean anyone admires Capone - he's just part of American reality.\" </p> <p>Pilar Velillo, director of the new museum in Medellin, said: \"It's impossible for a Colombian, and especially an artist to be on the sidelines of what is happening to us. Just as Picasso painted Guernica, Botero had to paint 'Sureshot'.\" </p> <p>The collection is to be housed in two restored colonial buildings which form the centrepiece of an ambitious plan to revitalise the centre of Colombia's third-largest city. He is formally opening the exhibition today and a rundown neighbour has been renamed \"Botero City\" where the artist's corpulent statues will be on permanent display in a new park. </p> <p>\"This isn't just about showing pictures - it's about awakening pride and a sense of belonging. We aren't just making a museum, we're proposing a change of attitude. Our city has been really beaten up by violence, but we're not all bad here,\" said Ms Velilla. </p> <p>Like the novels of Colombia's other artistic giant, Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Botero's art is steeped in his native culture with references to the landmarks and customs of Medellin, despite having lived abroad for 48 years. </p> <p><strong> Failed kidnapping</strong><br> </p> <p> \"In a way, Botero has never left,\" said Ms Velilla, but after a failed kidnapping attempt in 1994, the painter was forced to restrict his visits to Medellin. </p> <p>\"After that I couldn't come to Colombia so often, because I was a real danger, but it makes me very sad. It's very hard when you can't visit your own land,\" Botero said. In 10 years, the civil war has forced more than a million Colombians from their homes, while tens of thousands have fled abroad. </p> <p>Botero's work itself became the focus of the violence in June 1995, when a bomb in Medellin tore apart his statue of a dove, killing 25 people. He insisted the statue stay put as a \"monument to stupidity\". </p> <p>In 1998, President Andres Pastrana launched talks with Farc, but progress has been very slow. </p> <p>Said Botero: \"The situation in Colombia couldn't be worse. We have to have faith, because it's the only option we have. But it's hard to stay optimistic when there's no sign of change.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "His paintings show a serene world peopled by obese - yet elegant - figures in dreamlike scenes far removed from the drug-fuelled violence that wracks his homeland. Now artist Fernando Botero is sending a huge collection of artworks back to his native Colombia, even though he feels it is too unsafe to live there full-time himself. The donation, said to be valued at more than $100m (\u00a368m), includes some 200 works by Botero, and nearly 100 pieces by others from his own collection, which includes Monet, Picasso, Dali and Bacon. They are to be shown at museums in Bogota and a purpose-built gallery in Medellin, city of his birth. \"It was a way to help Colombia and a way to change the face of Medellin,\" said Botero. \"We wanted to show that it's not just the city of the cartels, assassins, death and crime..\" Until recently, Botero's art ignored Colombia's endemic violence, but earlier this year, the painter sparked controversy when he unveiled a new collection portraying the turmoil of crime and war. One picture shows drug baron Pablo Escobar dying in a hail of police bullets. In another, Manuel \"Sureshot\" Marulanda, legendary leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), stands calmly in a jungle clearing, carrying a strangely harmless-looking machine gun. Other paintings in the series include the aftermath of a car-bomb attack, a group of guerrillas resting in a forest and a massacre in a bar. Why did he break his own rules? \"Art should be an oasis, a place or refuge from the hardness of life,\" he explained. \"But the Colombian drama is so out of proportion that today you cannot ignore the violence, the thousands of displaced and dead, the processions of coffins. Against all my principles I had to paint [the violence].\" The paintings are oddly peaceful. In the Escobar portrait, the bullets seem frozen in mid-air. The drug baron's only wound is a tiny spot of blood, when in reality, he was practically torn apart by gunfire. When the paintings were released in July, some Colombians said the works glorified notorious outlaws. \"He has the complete right to immortalise whomever he wants,\" said an editorial in the Cali newspaper, El Pais. \"However, one is left with a certain unease.\" Botero insists that no moral judgment was intended. \"It wasn't a homage, I was giving testimony on people who are central to Colombian life ... In the US, there are films and books about Al Capone, but that doesn't mean anyone admires Capone - he's just part of American reality.\" Pilar Velillo, director of the new museum in Medellin, said: \"It's impossible for a Colombian, and especially an artist to be on the sidelines of what is happening to us. Just as Picasso painted Guernica, Botero had to paint 'Sureshot'.\" The collection is to be housed in two restored colonial buildings which form the centrepiece of an ambitious plan to revitalise the centre of Colombia's third-largest city. He is formally opening the exhibition today and a rundown neighbour has been renamed \"Botero City\" where the artist's corpulent statues will be on permanent display in a new park. \"This isn't just about showing pictures - it's about awakening pride and a sense of belonging. We aren't just making a museum, we're proposing a change of attitude. Our city has been really beaten up by violence, but we're not all bad here,\" said Ms Velilla. Like the novels of Colombia's other artistic giant, Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Botero's art is steeped in his native culture with references to the landmarks and customs of Medellin, despite having lived abroad for 48 years. Failed kidnapping \"In a way, Botero has never left,\" said Ms Velilla, but after a failed kidnapping attempt in 1994, the painter was forced to restrict his visits to Medellin. \"After that I couldn't come to Colombia so often, because I was a real danger, but it makes me very sad. It's very hard when you can't visit your own land,\" Botero said. In 10 years, the civil war has forced more than a million Colombians from their homes, while tens of thousands have fled abroad. Botero's work itself became the focus of the violence in June 1995, when a bomb in Medellin tore apart his statue of a dove, killing 25 people. He insisted the statue stay put as a \"monument to stupidity\". In 1998, President Andres Pastrana launched talks with Farc, but progress has been very slow. Said Botero: \"The situation in Colombia couldn't be worse. We have to have faith, because it's the only option we have. But it's hard to stay optimistic when there's no sign of change.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Philippa Pearce lives just down the lane from her birthplace, the mill house with the magical garden that inspired her book Tom's Midnight Garden. First published in 1958, it remains one of the finest of fantasies, allowing two children from different times to meet and experience the freedom of childhood while one grows old and the other doesn't. </p> <p>Pearce's involvement with the old house is still intense, although now that it is no longer in danger of demolition, as it was when she wrote Tom's Midnight Garden , she is free from the fear that fuelled the book. \"When I wrote it I was terrified that the house would be pulled down,\" she says. \"I had been born and brought up in it. It had been our place, my father's and his father's before him, but country milling was dying. The war had given it an artificial life, but it had no future. It seemed so important, I suppose, because I didn't have a child. Once I did, it looked quite different.\" </p> <p>Set in an idyllic meadow by a stretch of the river, the house still has the wonderful garden that Tom and his friend Hatty play in during the magical midnight hours. Today Pearce sees the house in triplicate: as her child-self did, as her present self does and as Tom and Hatty do in the story. Now, at 80, with a new anthology, The Rope and Other Stories , and the film of Tom's Midnight Garden just released, Pearce still uses the landscape and experiences of her childhood to spark her stories: the title story of the new collection is set on the river of the mill, where there once was a rope swing. </p> <p>\"I wrote my three major books, Minnow on the Say , Tom's Midnight Garden and A Dog So Small , before my daughter was born. The first two are related to my own childhood, especially in setting, but A Dog So Small is a reflection on fantasy life, what you can have and what you can't. Its setting is Hampstead Heath, because that's where I was living at the time.\" </p> <p>Pearce's move into writing for children came when, as a bright Cambridge graduate, she began doing schools broadcasting for the BBC. \"I started adapting all sorts of stories. Nearly all the programmes were 20 minutes long and I was the scriptwriter, so I quickly learned how a story is structured so that I could reduce it. I was editing folk and fairy stories and adapting children's writers such as Rosemary Sutcliff and Clive King, and I vaguely thought 'I could do that.' The work gave me a natural link to children.\" </p> <p>The child Pearce wrote about was herself, and the canoe-based adventure of her first book, Minnow on the Say , marks out her own childhood. Looking back on it, she grimaces slightly at that first attempt. \"It has far too much plot and a very unconvincing villain. It seemed all right at the time, but I hate the idea that someone is evil. It is usually that they are badly nurtured.\" But it was a starting point, and one that her family much appreciated. \"My mother was very progressive and very imaginative. When she married my father and came to Cambridge she immediately saw the opportunities it offered. We were all very well educated, and that came from her. When Minnow was published she and my father hung Union Jacks out of the windows.\" </p> <p>While Minnow was a mild success, it was Tom's Midnight Garden that really took off. \"The story came from the feelings released by the sale of the house, but also from stories my father told me as a child. It was his stories of skating that I drew on. It was far too long when I first wrote it, and my editor suggested two big chunks to be cut. There was a great wodge on the skating that went, and the ending went on far too long, including the gardener marrying the maid. It was much better when I'd edited it, and I didn't waste anything as I wrote a short story, 'Still Jim and Silent Jim', which used most of the material.\" </p> <p>Pearce turned to short stories after her daughter was born, and has remained loyal to them ever since. \"I only really had time for short stories then. It's not because they are less work, but they don't take the concentrated and extended effort. I've always loved short stories ever since my older brother introduced me to MR James. Publishers say readers prefer a novel because you get to know the characters, but I like stories because they are like a party. You just meet people briefly.\" </p> <p>Six anthologies for varying ages reflect Pearce's commitment to the form over the last 30 years. Her liking for brevity is reflected in her economy of style: she touches on people, places and incidents delicately. Plot, apart from in Minnow on the Say , is kept to a minimum; the strength of her books lies in their their emotional appeal. Of The Way to Sattin Shore , a mystery of enormous insight and depth, and one of only two full-length books that she has written in the same period, she says: \"The plot doesn't really work - but what makes it worthwhile is an intensity of feeling which affects the characters and the landscape. It's about the changes these things can make.\" </p> <p>\"Intensity of feeling\" seems to be the starting point of all her writing. \"Writing comes from a minute experience, very transient, which seems to grow in your mind. To begin with, the story is organic. It's a seed that grows and you have to nurture it. Then it's a bit of constructive woodwork. You are a cabinet-maker.\" </p> <p>This intensity, coupled with a rare ability to see the world from a child's point of view, makes Pearce at 80 as powerful a communicator with children as she has always been. But then, as she says, \"With a book, people can always say something critical, or maybe they just don't like it. But nobody can argue with you being 80. It's just a fact.\"</p>",

He mocked his parents' world, felt insecure and often out of place in it, but he married into it and never really cut himself adrift.

The novel also juxtaposes without comment the febrility and wasted leisure of the rich world with the work-filled, directly experienced lives of factory folk. And yet within months of leaving \"Bridesley\", there is Henry Yorke a world away, leading his bride, Lord Biddulph's daughter, out of St Margaret's, Westminster on an uncomfortably hot July day, with top hat, furled umbrella and all the other obligatory accoutrements of a society wedding. </p> <p>In his first autobiographical novel, Blindness, begun in Green's last year at Eton, the central character starts a diary that will act as \"a sort of pipe to draw off the swamp water\" - writing's role in his psychic economy.

      "body": "<p><strong> Ubiquity</strong> <br>Mark Buchanan <br>230pp, Weidenfeld, \u00a320</p> <p> Why are physics textbooks full of mathematics and biology books full of words? Because, as the great Richard Feynman once pointed out, physics is simple. Classical physics deals with inanimate objects performing relatively simple behaviours that can be described adequately using straightforward equations. The motion of heavenly bodies, the jiggling of atoms within molecules, even relativistic behaviours and the strange shenanigans of the quantum world - they can all be described using the general sort of equations with which most of us struggled at school. </p> <p>Raise the level of complexity, however, and mathematicians begin to struggle. Notice, for example, how often the weather forecast is wrong. The atmosphere is complicated, and its description requires equations that are exquisitely sensitive to input errors. By the time we reach the irredeemably complex world of living things, traditional maths is virtually useless. Master all the mathematics in all the textbooks of classical physics in the world, and you would not be in a position even to begin to describe the internal workings of an ant. </p> <p>At least, this was the situation until recently. In the last few decades, mathematicians have started grappling with more complex areas of science. First came the analysis of non-linear systems, beautifully explained by James Gleick in his 1988 bestseller Chaos . Then came complexity theory, outlined in Roger Lewin's Complexity . Now we have Mark Buchanan's Ubiquity , a book explaining the behaviour of systems in the \"critical state\", a concept described by the author as \"the first really solid discovery of complexity theory\" (to give a flavour of the intellectual lineage). </p> <p>The basic principle is that certain systems, under certain circumstances, behave in rather curious yet mathematically similar ways. For a practical illustration of the idea, take a handful of rice and drop the grains one by one on to a table top. Soon you will have a pile of rice. But the pile will not grow taller for ever: eventually the addition of one more grain will cause an avalanche. Keep a tally of the magnitudes of these avalanches and a characteristic pattern emerges, one that can be described mathematically using a power function. The important point about this in the present context is that the power-function description implies something profound about our ability to predict the behaviour of the rice pile. The addition of a single grain may have no discernible effect, or it may precipitate a small avalanche, or a big one, or a series of avalanches resulting in a catastrophic collapse of the whole structure. Because of the particular mathematical distribution of avalanche magnitudes, predicting which of these consequences will ensue is, for all practical purposes, impossible. </p> <p>Having established this underlying principle, Buchanan goes on to explain how it might be extended to shed light on the behaviour of more complex systems. Perhaps the most interesting concerns earthquake prediction. If fault systems in the earth's crust are in a critical state, and if the magnitude and timing of slippages along the faults follow a power law, then predicting when earthquakes will strike, and how destructive they will be, should prove virtually impossible. Historical records of the timing and magnitudes of earthquakes do seem to follow a power law, which suggests, among other things, that seismologists around the world may be wasting their own time and large amounts of our money banging their heads against an insoluble problem. To be fair to the profession, many seismologists had already come to this conclusion without the aid of rice. </p> <p>Moreover, many earth scientists believe that critical-state theorists are overreaching somewhat when they try to liken the behaviour of something as complicated as the earth's crust to a pile of grain. And when essentially the same technique is employed to explain everything (note the book's title) from forest fires to stock market fluctuations, from extinctions in the fossil record to upheavals in human history, many feel that they are not so much overreaching as hurling themselves into the wide blue yonder. Perhaps because of this attitude of intellectual derring-do, most historians, economists and historical scientists at the present time seem willing to do little more than look on, often in bewilderment, as the mathematicians fly past. This is a shame because the whole project is refreshingly courageous and potentially very important. However, the theorists' cause is not helped by the extreme simplification of reality inevitably required by their analyses, nor by their sometimes shocking ignorance of the problems under investigation. The best that can be said about Buchanan's treatment of extinctions, for example, in particular the Permian mass extinction, is that the many factual errors do not greatly affect the conclusion. </p> <p> Ubiquity represents an audacious attempt to explain an equally audacious ongoing programme of research, and herein lies its great strength and weakness. Any author who risks stretching ideas across numerous academic disciplines and well beyond the boundaries of knowledge is sure to receive both admiration and criticism; only time will tell which forms the greater part of the response in this case. For my part, I wish there were more juicy, thought-provoking books like Buchanan's on the now-groaning popular-science shelves of the nation's bookstores.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ubiquity Mark Buchanan 230pp, Weidenfeld, \u00a320 Why are physics textbooks full of mathematics and biology books full of words? Because, as the great Richard Feynman once pointed out, physics is simple. Classical physics deals with inanimate objects performing relatively simple behaviours that can be described adequately using straightforward equations. The motion of heavenly bodies, the jiggling of atoms within molecules, even relativistic behaviours and the strange shenanigans of the quantum world - they can all be described using the general sort of equations with which most of us struggled at school. Raise the level of complexity, however, and mathematicians begin to struggle. Notice, for example, how often the weather forecast is wrong. The atmosphere is complicated, and its description requires equations that are exquisitely sensitive to input errors. By the time we reach the irredeemably complex world of living things, traditional maths is virtually useless. Master all the mathematics in all the textbooks of classical physics in the world, and you would not be in a position even to begin to describe the internal workings of an ant. At least, this was the situation until recently. In the last few decades, mathematicians have started grappling with more complex areas of science. First came the analysis of non-linear systems, beautifully explained by James Gleick in his 1988 bestseller Chaos . Then came complexity theory, outlined in Roger Lewin's Complexity . Now we have Mark Buchanan's Ubiquity , a book explaining the behaviour of systems in the \"critical state\", a concept described by the author as \"the first really solid discovery of complexity theory\" (to give a flavour of the intellectual lineage). The basic principle is that certain systems, under certain circumstances, behave in rather curious yet mathematically similar ways. For a practical illustration of the idea, take a handful of rice and drop the grains one by one on to a table top. Soon you will have a pile of rice. But the pile will not grow taller for ever: eventually the addition of one more grain will cause an avalanche. Keep a tally of the magnitudes of these avalanches and a characteristic pattern emerges, one that can be described mathematically using a power function. The important point about this in the present context is that the power-function description implies something profound about our ability to predict the behaviour of the rice pile. The addition of a single grain may have no discernible effect, or it may precipitate a small avalanche, or a big one, or a series of avalanches resulting in a catastrophic collapse of the whole structure. Because of the particular mathematical distribution of avalanche magnitudes, predicting which of these consequences will ensue is, for all practical purposes, impossible. Having established this underlying principle, Buchanan goes on to explain how it might be extended to shed light on the behaviour of more complex systems. Perhaps the most interesting concerns earthquake prediction. If fault systems in the earth's crust are in a critical state, and if the magnitude and timing of slippages along the faults follow a power law, then predicting when earthquakes will strike, and how destructive they will be, should prove virtually impossible. Historical records of the timing and magnitudes of earthquakes do seem to follow a power law, which suggests, among other things, that seismologists around the world may be wasting their own time and large amounts of our money banging their heads against an insoluble problem. To be fair to the profession, many seismologists had already come to this conclusion without the aid of rice. Moreover, many earth scientists believe that critical-state theorists are overreaching somewhat when they try to liken the behaviour of something as complicated as the earth's crust to a pile of grain. And when essentially the same technique is employed to explain everything (note the book's title) from forest fires to stock market fluctuations, from extinctions in the fossil record to upheavals in human history, many feel that they are not so much overreaching as hurling themselves into the wide blue yonder. Perhaps because of this attitude of intellectual derring-do, most historians, economists and historical scientists at the present time seem willing to do little more than look on, often in bewilderment, as the mathematicians fly past. This is a shame because the whole project is refreshingly courageous and potentially very important. However, the theorists' cause is not helped by the extreme simplification of reality inevitably required by their analyses, nor by their sometimes shocking ignorance of the problems under investigation. The best that can be said about Buchanan's treatment of extinctions, for example, in particular the Permian mass extinction, is that the many factual errors do not greatly affect the conclusion. Ubiquity represents an audacious attempt to explain an equally audacious ongoing programme of research, and herein lies its great strength and weakness. Any author who risks stretching ideas across numerous academic disciplines and well beyond the boundaries of knowledge is sure to receive both admiration and criticism; only time will tell which forms the greater part of the response in this case. For my part, I wish there were more juicy, thought-provoking books like Buchanan's on the now-groaning popular-science shelves of the nation's bookstores.",

But last month, in the London Evening Standard , Imogen Edwards-Jones offered \"the uncensored, real-life version\". One passage began: \"A night out is not a night out unless you end up drinking absinthe cocktails at the Met Bar, waving loudly at Zoe Ball . . . It is normally only a matter of time before you're befriending the right stylist and you're up in a junior suite in the Metropolitan Hotel with a pop star. . .\" Edwards-Jones's debut, it seemed pretty likely, was not exactly going to be Evelyn Waugh. </p> <p>Her protagonist, Abigail Long, is a newspaper gossip columnist. She is 28. She lives in a small flat in a smart part of west London, and is given to dark thoughts about her life's direction. At a party, she meets a rising young British film star called Jack Morris, begins to get close to him, and then finds his body on a cocaine-scattered hotel mattress. Her subsequent drift into drug addiction, celebrity of her own, bad acquaintances and recovery may be impossible to summarise without sounding trite. </p> <p>There are hints, every now and again, of a smarter novel trying to get out. The dying plants and sly sexual discrimination of Abigail's newspaper office are well evoked (the author writes for the Times and the mid-market tabloids). The endless waiting and \"tonic-water burps\" of the professional partygoer tartly punctuate the namedrops (the author used to be a gossip columnist). But this is not really a novel - and does not try very hard to be one. Instead, it is a series of overlapping routines: the usual sweet and sour fictions about an urban woman approaching 30; the predictable Notting Hill imitation of Friends , with much slumming and banter over big coffee mugs; the love triangle required by today's softer genres; and, most extended of all, a voyeur's tour of the capital's VIP rooms. </p> <p>This is conducted in uncertain tones. One moment, Edwards-Jones is as bright and cliched as a tabloid showbiz page; the next she is muttering seedily about how \"It's difficult to chop out [cocaine] when there's a paper-towel attendant.\" Partly, the sentiments reflect Abigail's switches of mood; yet the writing feels rushed and jerrybuilt. Cachet is spelled \"cach\u00e9\". A Wurlitzer jukebox becomes a \"Whirlitza\". Even the pornographer Larry Flynt, an international celebrity himself, is misnamed Larry Flint. </p> <p>You sense the author slapping together chapters in the loos between film premieres. There is none of the gleeful precision of Bret Easton Ellis's star mockery in Glamorama , which suggested that research and sharp sentences could still hold their own against the ever-swelling celebrity bubble. Less clearly directed efforts at parody or criticism, such as this one, simply bounce off its shiny skin. </p> <p>But Edwards-Jones probably isn't worried.

      "bodyText": "My Canape Hell Imogen Edwards-Jones Hodder, \u00a310 Buy it at BOL If you are about to publish \"a sexy satire on celebrity culture\", as this book sells itself, then it might not be best practice to write a rival version, of a pretty unsatirical nature, in a newspaper a fortnight before. But last month, in the London Evening Standard , Imogen Edwards-Jones offered \"the uncensored, real-life version\". One passage began: \"A night out is not a night out unless you end up drinking absinthe cocktails at the Met Bar, waving loudly at Zoe Ball . . . It is normally only a matter of time before you're befriending the right stylist and you're up in a junior suite in the Metropolitan Hotel with a pop star. . .\" Edwards-Jones's debut, it seemed pretty likely, was not exactly going to be Evelyn Waugh. Her protagonist, Abigail Long, is a newspaper gossip columnist. She is 28. She lives in a small flat in a smart part of west London, and is given to dark thoughts about her life's direction. At a party, she meets a rising young British film star called Jack Morris, begins to get close to him, and then finds his body on a cocaine-scattered hotel mattress. Her subsequent drift into drug addiction, celebrity of her own, bad acquaintances and recovery may be impossible to summarise without sounding trite. There are hints, every now and again, of a smarter novel trying to get out. The dying plants and sly sexual discrimination of Abigail's newspaper office are well evoked (the author writes for the Times and the mid-market tabloids). The endless waiting and \"tonic-water burps\" of the professional partygoer tartly punctuate the namedrops (the author used to be a gossip columnist). But this is not really a novel - and does not try very hard to be one. Instead, it is a series of overlapping routines: the usual sweet and sour fictions about an urban woman approaching 30; the predictable Notting Hill imitation of Friends , with much slumming and banter over big coffee mugs; the love triangle required by today's softer genres; and, most extended of all, a voyeur's tour of the capital's VIP rooms. This is conducted in uncertain tones. One moment, Edwards-Jones is as bright and cliched as a tabloid showbiz page; the next she is muttering seedily about how \"It's difficult to chop out [cocaine] when there's a paper-towel attendant.\" Partly, the sentiments reflect Abigail's switches of mood; yet the writing feels rushed and jerrybuilt. Cachet is spelled \"cach\u00e9\". A Wurlitzer jukebox becomes a \"Whirlitza\". Even the pornographer Larry Flynt, an international celebrity himself, is misnamed Larry Flint. You sense the author slapping together chapters in the loos between film premieres. There is none of the gleeful precision of Bret Easton Ellis's star mockery in Glamorama , which suggested that research and sharp sentences could still hold their own against the ever-swelling celebrity bubble. Less clearly directed efforts at parody or criticism, such as this one, simply bounce off its shiny skin. But Edwards-Jones probably isn't worried. She has her newspaper career to think of, after all, and stars and PRs to stay on the right side of. This book, appropriately, most resembles a celebrity opening: full of famous names and unfocused motives, other than that of raising the profiles of all involved. And like the clever, connected people who organise such events, the author has plenty of personal resources to fall back on if this particular party goes flat. By far the most convincing sections here are not about stars at all, but about Abigail's posh friends and parents.

From its beginnings on the soggy, cratered ground of the Western Front, it has been engineered for supremacy. A protected mobile space carrying only the crew necessary to transport and serve a direct-fire weapon, its ultimate object has always been the breakthrough - achieved by killing its (ideally outclassed) opponents and then wreaking invulnerable havoc among the unprotected. The Germans ground into their Flanders trenches, the Allied tankers who faced Tigers and Panthers in the undergunned Sherman (the \"tommy-cooker\"), the Gulf War Iraqis immolated before they could fire a round - all were minnows before the sharks of the battlefield. </p> <p>Yet Patrick Wright is interested not only in the tank as instrument of warfare but also in its \"miasmic afterlife, which has lifted it from its customary motor pools and battlefields and relaunched it as a phantom of the modern imagination\". This takes him from Tiananmen protestor to agitprop art, from first-world-war propaganda to whether digitisation means a \"revolution in military affairs\". So the tank's successes at Cambrai in 1917 are followed by its use as a patriotic fund-raiser around Britain (the \"tank bank\"); the first Blitzkrieg is coupled with the unravelling of the myth of the Polish lancer versus the German panzer; Amos Oz follows swiftly on the heels of the Six Day War. Wright's style throughout is discursive, even languid, and his breadth of reference exciting. </p> <p>This approach throws up frequent gems. War Office refusals to provide a single man for initial tank trials in 1915-16 led to a tentative approach to Mrs Pankhurst to find crews of suffragettes instead (60 volunteered). And Wright's search for the truth of whether the Turkish army punishes inanimate objects conjures up a splendidly bizarre image: a tank on a hillside, surrounded by a picket fence, guarded by a sentry, parked in mechanical Coventry for the sins set out on a nearby sign. </p> <p>But more often it serves to annoy. Wright is too self-indulgent an author to know when to stop, and none of his extensive reading must go to waste. Armour prophet JFC Fuller was an early acolyte of satanist Aleister Crowley, so the pre-tank ramblings of the Great Beast get 20 pages. An eccentric artist's mobile apartment for the homeless - which even Wright admits looks more like an armoured personnel carrier than a tank - claims 10 more. As minor writer and fascist Curzio Malaparte followed tanks about the Eastern Front, we have to hear about him and his un-tanklike house on Capri. Time and again, material that merits a paragraph and a footnote gets five or 10 pages. The overall effect is of nothing so much as the lyrical transcription of material thrown up by typing \"tank\" into a shoddy net search engine. </p> <p>The space wasted on the irrelevant might have been better allocated to filling holes. An examination of the inter-war revolution in armour should focus on Nomonhan (where Zhukov practised Tukhachevsky's preachings on lightly armed Japanese), rather than Spain, as the harbinger of the operational future. And straitened interwar military establishments didn't just oppose mechanisation because (pace British Field Marshal Montgomery-Massingberd) tanks dirtied their jodhpurs. They noticed that machines were expensive, unreliable, logistically demanding and not that mobile - all of which undermined the apparently overwhelming logic for pensioning off the horse. </p> <p>These apart, Wright is better on the military aspects than many so-called military historians, in part because he writes so well. Instead, most of the holes are in his thesis on tank as \"cultural phantom\". Where is the tank and the coup, the tank and popular literature, the tank and the war film, the psychology and technology of tank-killing? Where is the tank as privatised toy, hired out by the hour on ranges around the world? Some of these get mentioned in passing, some ignored altogether; yet all have defined the cultural spectre of the tank far more than the satanic ramblings of Aleister Crowley. Most of all, where is the peace tank? The political shifts of the 1990s have produced the bizarre image of tanks denying their \"tankness\" - parked in the open, painted white, reassuring some and bluffing others, all on behalf of that miasmic entity, the international community. Nothing represents the shift in the moral environment of armour better than UNPROFOR's Danish Leopard and its female gunner, emptying every round of main gun ammunition into Serb positions to teach their recalcitrant garrison a lesson. It's the acronymic armour of peace support rather than the digital ramblings of the US Armor Center that will define the cultural phantom for the post-Desert Storm generation. </p> <p>Wright's search for the allegorical also undermines his exposition of the real. He claims that the tank was engineered out of the cultural imagination of the second decade of the 20th century. But it wasn't: it was a pragmatic product of the first-ever coincidence of shell-torn trench lines with the means (the caterpillar track) to cross them. It may have begun \"in a cloud of frantic period fantasy\", as soldiers and propagandists peddled absurd notions of the landship's power. But the fantasy has never detracted from the essence of the tank, both in function and experience: it is a weapon of war, crewed by and aimed at man. </p> <p>This is the idea that is struggling to emerge from the frantic fantasy of Wright's prose. Popular perceptions of the weapon are defined as much by representations of the people in it and facing it as by the image of the weapon itself. The key to the cultural phantom is the tank's combination of power and vulnerability. It is the power that breaks battalions; it is the vulnerability that makes them stay put, waiting for a Ganju Lama VC to destroy a tank and turn the tide. For every tank crewman knows that his comparatively comfort able ride into battle has its downside. Once the armoured shell is penetrated, the whole crew may share the same fate: minced by a HESH round, torched by white phosphorus. The better protected the tank, the less it can see; and when its vision devices are smashed, it is a cripple waiting for the coup de grace. The power of the image of the tank defied may derive from the sense of its omnipotence, but the image is so widespread because the tank is so weak. </p> <p>At the same time, the inanimate is perhaps ultra-human. Tank crews (and those of other armoured vehicles) live more closely than any servicemen save submariners. Three to five men may spend 20 hours a day boxed up in a small compartment, relying entirely on each other's skills for survival. This proximity builds bonds strong even by the standards of a close-knit profession. The power of the tank also rests on human shoulders. As Wright himself points out, the Tiananmen protestor only stopped a column of PLA armour because the driver of the lead tank chose not to roll over him. The size and vulnerability of the weapon may simply serve to magnify the humanity of those who wield it. </p> <p>This is a message that will not go away. The tank is as vulnerable, and as human, as ever. Grozny, New Year 1994-5: lost, unsupported Russian tanks are hunted down by packs of Chechens with rocket-propelled grenades and turf knowledge. Southern Lebanon, 2000: the safest tank in the world, the Israeli Merkava, falls to Hizbollah's TOW missiles. Both were images that shaped policy. The tank's symbolic resonance is a function of the humanity of those who create, serve and are killed by it. Perhaps if Wright had ignored the whimsical siren of second-rate artists and stuck with the squeal of sprockets, Tank wouldn't have read like a missed opportunity.</p>",

Given that any actual society will have a finite amount of resources to distribute initially (for the alternative, an infinite amount of resources, makes the whole problem disappear), the latter option, it seems to me, is impossible, and so this pseudo-choice cannot be used to demonstrate incoherence in Rawls. Still, it seems likely that, had I encountered Honderich's glintingly engaging prose at a more impressionable age, I might have chosen his subject at university instead of sloshing around with poets and dramatists.

This simple fact explains not only the enthusiastic, youthful drug-taking of eight members of William Hague's Shadow Cabinet, but also the eating of prawn-cocktail crisps, the conduct of extra-marital affairs, and the reading of works of reference. Some of these activities, of course, might be said to be more harmful than others. A bag of prawn-cocktail crisps, for example, contains about 151 calories. And the adulterer ends up an Esau. </p> <p>Those who prefer the milder pleasures of pin-sticking, map-making, and canon-formation might like to argue that works of reference are in fact no sin but instead mark a high point in culture. It is true, after all, that of the basic types of tool, those for boring took the longest time to develop and evolve (the problem being to obtain continuous rotation with a bit-holder that could withstand the turning strain). The new Oxford Companion to English Literature might therefore be described as a magnificent, big bore. </p> <p>This, the eighth edition of Sir Paul Harvey's 1932 original, is once again edited by the novelist Margaret Drabble, who took up the baton in 1985, assisted by a team of eminent advisers and contributors, sure-footed academics (Bernard O'Donoghue), journalists (Michael Billington), poets (Ciaran Carson) and novelists (Salman Rushdie) among them. </p> <p>Drabble is an ideal editor. In interview, some years ago, she commented: \"My favourite dreams are where I'm travelling through landscapes very rapidly, but by no known means of transport, not flying but going through it.\" Drabble's dreams may have been prophetic: her Companion is a brisk tour of the English literary landscape. </p> <p>The book is at times misleading, but always good company. Surveying the more recent developments proves to be the biggest problem. One is reminded of Mondrian, writing to Winifred Nicholson: \"No, I cannot come to Cumberland. It is too green.\" It is surely too early to judge, say, Simon Armitage, or Kate Atkinson: we are not in possession of the full facts. They are too green, and we are inhibited by our ignorance. </p> <p>The book nonetheless makes a brave attempt at making sense of the havoc of the contemporary, even though some of the new entries sound more like wrap-around jacket blurbs than entries in the Britannica. Nick Hornby, for example, one may be surprised to learn, is \"the spokesman for a generation of emotionally bewildered young men\". (Which generation, exactly?) Ben Elton's comedy has apparently \"filtered down into the work of many young novelists\". (Name two). And Black British Literature \"has as its themes loneliness, harassment, and exploita tion\" - a more lonely, harassed and exploitative definition it is hard to imagine. </p> <p>The usual metropolitan and highbrow bias can be discerned. Thus, we get Sebastian Faulks, author of the rather toney but nonetheless bestselling Birdsong, but not Robert Harris, author of the equally bestselling but rather sportier Fatherland. Philip Hensher, \"educated at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge\", and the author of just three novels, including the admittedly accomplished Kitchen Venom (1996) - \"much-praised\" - finds himself graced with an entry, but not the equally accomplished Andrew Greig, Dermot Bolger, or Joseph Connolly. It's also no go to Tim Parks, but yes to the other Tim, Pears. And yes to Esther Freud, and no to Helen Simpson. </p> <p>Other curiosities and impertinences include genre fiction treated en bloc (\"Spy fiction\", \"Fantasy Fiction\"), only two Roths - Joseph and Philip - and John but not Frank of the O'Haras. There is no J H Prynne, needless to say. </p> <p>Some entries assume considerable philosophical sophistication - Merleau-Ponty, we are told, was reacting against \"Cartesian idealism\" and \"based his epistemology on the relationship between consciousness and the world\". Other entries assume virtual illiteracy, or lives led as hermits, professors, or High Court judges. Of Irvine Welsh, it is said that: \"He has claimed to be as interested in music as he is in writing, and in the mid-1990s worked as a DJ.\" Precedent seems to compel: the \"DJ\" here comes provided with its own handy parenthesis, \"(disc jockey)\". </p> <p>Despite all this wielding of scalpel and knife, some issues remain resolutely fudged. The book advertises itself still as a companion to \"English Literature\", note, and not \"literature in English\", which, according to Drabble in her preface, \"is another matter entirely\". Unfortunately, these days, the other matter entirely consists of virtually all books published in the English language: there is no eternal tie between England, English, and literature. </p> <p>The Companion may show its age, then, and occasionally lean heavily upon its stick, but it can still be relied upon for sensible advice and information, and students and teachers across the country, as badly prepared, sleepy, and forgetful as ever, will undoubtedly be delighted. </p> <p>Coleridge once said that a man who looked round him from the top of St Paul's and remembered everything he saw would go mad - the dizzying prospect would be too much.

Sentences like \"Some of the things I used to wear a few years ago were horrendous and when I look back, I think what was I doing?\" smack more of mutterings to some hired hack over the snooker table than of the tortured stylistic wrestlings of a Flaubert. In fact Beckham's prose is as excruciating as one imagines VS Naipaul's shots at goal would be. Reading this aggressively styleless book is a bit like munching your way dutifully through yard upon yard of muslin. </p> <p>Curiously, though, its very monotone, stream-of-tape-recorded consciousness style begins after a while to seem like some artful, sub-Pinteresque device. \"I had,\" he tells us, \"one really, really good friend called John at primary school, but when we moved on, we went to different schools and sort of split up. We were never as good friends again. I had other friends at school and out of school, but no one like him.\" There have been livelier narratives. We never encounter John again, or probe deeper into why he meant so much to Beckham. It is just one of those bald, uninterpretable things, like chasing someone with a vacuum cleaner, wearing a sarong or including a close-up photo of your dirty feet in your autobiography. Not that any of this matters much, since the text in this lavish production is far less important than the photographs, and neither can compete with the volume's delicious aroma. There could be no finer reason to buy this book than to sniff it. Readers who buy it but don't inhale are missing out on most of the fun. </p> <p>Since you can now apparently take a course in David Beckham at the University of Staffordshire, there's no point in his pretending to be an ordinary guy. Ordinary guys don't land up on the syllabus alongside Plato and Pynchon. But this is precisely what this crafty, apparently guileless book is out to counterfeit. Beckham projects himself as a shy, modest, chaste, uxorious, home-loving, extravagantly commonplace type, faintly naive and just a mite boring, not quite as geekish as Gary Lineker but tilting more towards him on the football-star spectrum than to the Dionysiac George Best. He tells us with arch, little-boy winsomeness that he is now \"relaxed enough to be in the same room as (the Spice Girls) and not sweat\", but to avoid sounding a complete nerd adds roguishly that he tried to hold his partner's hand on their first date, since \"that's the way I am\". </p> <p>He is relentlessly devoted to his wife, who seems to be some sort of performer, and records how much he was moved by her legs and short skirt when they first met. \"I see us as the perfect couple,\" he announces, a phrase which avoids odious self-adulation only because it clearly doesn't know itself to be even more unacceptable than referring to oneself and one's partner as a couple of prize turds. Their wedding ceremony, he remarks, went very well, though at one point he did \"get very hot in the folly\". This sounds an unusually risqu\u00e9 remark for such a doctrinaire New Man, but it turns out to be a reference to a bit of the castle in which they were married, rather than some salacious Cockney slang. For a man who has been regularly \"hit by thongs and knickers\", Beckham is upright in a moral rather than libidinal sense. At one point, he observes leeringly that a particular set of bra and panties he received in the post must have come from \"a big girl\". Elsewhere, however, he reveals that he likes to get in touch with the feminine side of himself: hence the celebrated sarong. He even cautiously enjoys a bit of art, and has been known to indulge in a little nature imagery, such as \"over the moon\". </p> <p>Nor has he any craven changing-room fear of feeling. Throughout the book he runs the whole gamut of emotion from \"chuffed\" to \"gutted\", while being on the whole (surprisingly, for a fabulously gifted millionaire) more gutted than chuffed, and he cheerfully confesses to a short temper. He is also far more addicted to cool new-age tattoos than to tacky old-style booze; indeed he intends to have the names of his future children etched into his back along with that of Brooklyn - which, given his ferocious domestic affections, might end up taxing even his lithe torso. </p> <p>The irony is that Beckham is indeed an ordinary guy, even if he is also playing at being one for all he's worth. The counterfeit is true after all. He comes across as attractively - as well as tediously - low-key, and is as quick to praise others as he is to criticise himself: \"I was showboating, hitting flash, stupid balls,\" he comments of his early days as a player. He also detests racism (he is a quarter Jewish himself), and isn't in the least bothered by being fancied by gay men. He may be a lousy author, but he is clearly a loving father, who has to endure obscene chants from the terraces about his wife and child. But even as an author he has his strong points. A lot of people will read this book as one might read something scribbled by a badger: what matters is the author rather than the content. But football fans will read it for inside information. and there's a good deal of that. </p> <p>But this regular guy is also a public fetish, and the book can work only by prudishly playing down that whole dimension. \"I have a camera up my backside almost 24 hours a day,\" Beckham tells us, but it's hard to know whether this is a boast or a whine. He is scrupulously careful not to overdo the moaning, so as to sidestep the obvious riposte: how come he's so averse to cameras when half this book, indeed half his life, consists of images? The camera here may not quite be poking up his backside, but it lingers on his naked torso or splayed thighs, surprises him in the bath or discovers him locked in erotic embrace with his wife or car. </p> <p>This split down the book's middle, between text and image, is also the fissure known as David Beckham. In the front half, the bashful lad who loves his old mum and prefers curling up with a take-away to showbiz orgies; in the second half, the sultry, self-displaying narcissist, hungry for the admiring gaze. In generously all-inclusive spirit, the first half of the book is for male football fans, the second for female fantasists. The split is most obvious when Beckham opens his mouth and speaks, as the sleek, postmodern body is suddenly converted into the uncertainly articulate working-class boy. There is no old-fashioned attempt at resolving this contradiction. The two personae simply lie incongruously cheek by jowl, with an inexplicable blank between them, as with so much of the culture that Beckham symbolises.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>What Lies Beneath is a movie that works in spite of itself, which is more than you can say for most of Michelle Pfeiffer's recent films. Hitchcockian, but nowhere near as good as Hitchcock, too long but not painfully so, intermittently laughable - unintentionally, I believe - but not to the point where it becomes impossible to take it seriously, What Lies Beneath is sufficiently frightening that its virtues far outweigh its shortcomings. If you like movies about gorgeous nitwits who don't have the good sense to flee a house that is obviously haunted by a malignant entity, this is the film for you. Personally, I happen to love films of this genre. </p> <p>Like The Sixth Sense, Stir of Echoes, Sleepy Hollow, The Haunting, The Haunting of Hill House and several other recent movies whose names are already forgotten, What Lies Beneath concerns an extremely unhappy dead person whose life has been prematurely terminated and who is now seeking what Americans routinely call \"closure\". </p> <p>In movies of this genre, a dysfunctional teenager, or vicious mercenary, or conflicted psychologist, or innocent child, or hapless lunatic has died before having a chance to tidy up the loose ends of his or her life, and is now seeking vengeance, vindication, justice, love or the aforementioned \"closure\". </p> <p>The amazing popularity of these motion pictures suggests that the general public desperately wants to believe that life has an underlying logic and that death is not meaningless or capricious. It is doubtful that this is what the general public believes in places like Rwanda, Serbia or the Sudan, but that need not concern us here.</p> <p>As the film opens, Michelle Pfeiffer, a retired cellist with a history of emotional problems, and her husband Harrison Ford, a brilliant scientist, are saying goodbye to their college-bound daughter, who may or may not reappear later when things turn less idyllic. With lots of time on her hands, Pfeiffer starts snooping into the affairs of her new neighbours, who seem to be experiencing a bit of domestic turmoil.</p> <p>This is the classic Hitchcockian gambit of introducing an interesting story that may be the linchpin of the plot, may be an intriguing subplot, may be a parallel story, or may have nothing to do with the principal thrust of the action, but is simply used as a diversionary tactic. Hitchcock used this trick in Rear Window, in Vertigo, in Family Plot and most famously in Psycho, and Robert Zemeckis is using it here. </p> <p>Eventually, Pfeiffer's fears about her neighbours give way to problems closer to home. The door keeps opening and closing of its own accord. The dog starts behaving oddly. Lights flicker on and off. The personal computer begins to behave strangely. Little by little, Pfeiffer begins to suspect that the house is inhabited, on at least a part-time basis, by a ghost. And, with the passage of time, she comes to believe that the ghost is not very nice.</p> <p>Ford, not entirely convincing in the role of a brilliant scientist, tries to humour his wife, who may or may not be completely bonkers. Though he is willing to believe that something odd is going in the house, he does not actually believe in the ghost because it never seems to be around when he is on the premises. Like Kevin Bacon in Stir of Echoes or the little boy in The Shining, Pfeiffer seems to be dealing with a ghost that only she can see.</p> <p>Soon it becomes apparent that the ghost is real, that she has a score to settle with both Ford and Pfeiffer, and that she is not leaving until this issue has been resolved.

      "bodyText": "What Lies Beneath is a movie that works in spite of itself, which is more than you can say for most of Michelle Pfeiffer's recent films. Hitchcockian, but nowhere near as good as Hitchcock, too long but not painfully so, intermittently laughable - unintentionally, I believe - but not to the point where it becomes impossible to take it seriously, What Lies Beneath is sufficiently frightening that its virtues far outweigh its shortcomings. If you like movies about gorgeous nitwits who don't have the good sense to flee a house that is obviously haunted by a malignant entity, this is the film for you. Personally, I happen to love films of this genre. Like The Sixth Sense, Stir of Echoes, Sleepy Hollow, The Haunting, The Haunting of Hill House and several other recent movies whose names are already forgotten, What Lies Beneath concerns an extremely unhappy dead person whose life has been prematurely terminated and who is now seeking what Americans routinely call \"closure\". In movies of this genre, a dysfunctional teenager, or vicious mercenary, or conflicted psychologist, or innocent child, or hapless lunatic has died before having a chance to tidy up the loose ends of his or her life, and is now seeking vengeance, vindication, justice, love or the aforementioned \"closure\". The amazing popularity of these motion pictures suggests that the general public desperately wants to believe that life has an underlying logic and that death is not meaningless or capricious. It is doubtful that this is what the general public believes in places like Rwanda, Serbia or the Sudan, but that need not concern us here. As the film opens, Michelle Pfeiffer, a retired cellist with a history of emotional problems, and her husband Harrison Ford, a brilliant scientist, are saying goodbye to their college-bound daughter, who may or may not reappear later when things turn less idyllic. With lots of time on her hands, Pfeiffer starts snooping into the affairs of her new neighbours, who seem to be experiencing a bit of domestic turmoil. This is the classic Hitchcockian gambit of introducing an interesting story that may be the linchpin of the plot, may be an intriguing subplot, may be a parallel story, or may have nothing to do with the principal thrust of the action, but is simply used as a diversionary tactic. Hitchcock used this trick in Rear Window, in Vertigo, in Family Plot and most famously in Psycho, and Robert Zemeckis is using it here. Eventually, Pfeiffer's fears about her neighbours give way to problems closer to home. The door keeps opening and closing of its own accord. The dog starts behaving oddly. Lights flicker on and off. The personal computer begins to behave strangely. Little by little, Pfeiffer begins to suspect that the house is inhabited, on at least a part-time basis, by a ghost. And, with the passage of time, she comes to believe that the ghost is not very nice. Ford, not entirely convincing in the role of a brilliant scientist, tries to humour his wife, who may or may not be completely bonkers. Though he is willing to believe that something odd is going in the house, he does not actually believe in the ghost because it never seems to be around when he is on the premises. Like Kevin Bacon in Stir of Echoes or the little boy in The Shining, Pfeiffer seems to be dealing with a ghost that only she can see. Soon it becomes apparent that the ghost is real, that she has a score to settle with both Ford and Pfeiffer, and that she is not leaving until this issue has been resolved. Though it is never made clear exactly how extensive her powers are, beyond the normal disruption of appliances, she certainly doesn't seem like the sort of creature you want to be trifling with. Eventually, the Ford-Pfeiffers realise that the ghost resents the blissful relationship they share and will probably not be happy until they move out, die or both. One thing that makes What Lies Beneath work so well are the light comic touches. Several of the encounters with the shadowy neighbours prove to be unexpectedly hilarious. Pfeiffer's attempt to contact her spectral visitor through the intercession of a Ouija board also leads to a few chuckles here and there. And many of the people in the theatre where I saw What Lies Beneath laughed hysterically at the sight of a bare-chested Harrison Ford sitting up with his laptop in bed trying to solve one of the great mysteries of science.

So I just try to choose the scripts that have the best characters for myself, or would be the most challenging, or fun. </p> <p><strong>Bring It On certainly seems to be mainly about the concept: teenage girls in mini-skirts and bare midriffs jumping around.

It's not your typical teen movie; usually in films, cheerleaders are stupid girls running around, or they're there to get killed. It's also got girls in short skirts, so guys'll like it too. It doesn't hurt to have that. </p> <p><strong>Did making the movie change your perception of cheerleading? </strong></p> <p>I actually did it in eighth grade for a little bit, to fit in more. I just wanted to be more popular. Being an actress doesn't make you popular in school. I was always leaving to make a movie then coming back in. But this is so much more involved; for these cheerleaders, it's their life. They practise for a year to perform this five-minute show, and if one person messes up it throws the whole routine off. There were three weeks of pre-production training, but I was on another film so I only had a week. Luckily, I'm pretty good at catching on to dance and stuff, so it was fun for me.

How are we meant to find these things out? If you ask a hotel they'll say you don't have to pay anything at all. Tipping, like the mafia, doesn't exist.

I didn't ask to get into this game where I'm expected to pay extra, but I'm never allowed to ask how much extra? If I'm ringing room service in a hotel I'm already paying a fiver for a cardboard sandwich that has done no more than brush past some cheese in the fridge - and then, for getting what I ordered, I'm meant to slip the person who brings it another couple of quid. And is a couple of quid enough? How are we meant to find these things out? If you ask a hotel they'll say you don't have to pay anything at all. Tipping, like the mafia, doesn't exist. But if you do want to make a voluntary contribution, you should make a payment that you think is appropriate for the service. But what does \"service\" mean when all you've asked for is a cheese sandwich? And how do we decide who to tip? For instance, for reasons I can't explain, it seems right to give the curry delivery man a few extra quid. But when the Tesco delivery van arrives with the groceries, I don't give anything. Why do I tip the barber and not the dentist? Why do we tip in restaurants but not pubs? All these questions would be entirely untroubling to an American, where tipping is a science rather than an art. In the States, you can buy \"tip calculators\" for your palm-top computer to work out the appropriate size of tip. You can buy books showing you how to use origami to leave the dollar bills on the restaurant table with the maximum visual effect. There are handbooks detailing the amount expected for every situation. Barbers are meant to collect 15%; 15% for room service, $10 for the bellboys, $2 for a pizza delivery, 15% to 20% for the waiter or waitress, a dollar for the bartender and so on. I've even seen guides claiming that tips are a British custom derived from the phrase \"to insure prompt service\". I don't believe this for a moment, because nowhere in the world does tipping seem less comfortable than here. Oh yes, and here's my tip. Don't tell the driver you want to go to Deptford until you're in the back of the cab. Email: coughlan_sean@hotmail.com",

Occasionally, he let rip with sudden violence, hammering home the cadenzas while Norrington hovered beside him, hand on hip, in an attitude that suggested both nonchalant informality and a certain arrogance. It all worked extremely well, largely because the concerto is about opposition, with orchestra and soloist alternately facing each other across the musical gulf that separates them and attempting to bridge it. \"Orpheus taming the Furies\" was how Liszt described the slow movement, though here it sounded more like a duel.

Despite these aberrations, the chirpy fellows kept the sparse crowd happy by squeezing in the odd request - such as the feel-good pop of Warm Fuzzy Feeling - and by introducing rockier songs from their new album, The Harsh Light of Day.

Two songs later, they made matters worse by going for a cover of Bowie's Life on Mars, replete with dual vocals, hammed-up guitars and an embarrassing lack of irony. Despite these aberrations, the chirpy fellows kept the sparse crowd happy by squeezing in the odd request - such as the feel-good pop of Warm Fuzzy Feeling - and by introducing rockier songs from their new album, The Harsh Light of Day. And it's always nice to hear a bit of slide guitar, don't you think?",

He's in a British tradition of landscape that has observation of the world as its beginning and end.

That's where the toughness of his early paintings comes from. </p> <p>Frost never had the massive originality of his American contemporaries. You can see that in the 1960s he started to jump on the latest bandwagons: he puts words in a painting, like the young David Hockney; he has a go at painting like Ellsworth Kelly.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The housing market is on a knife-edge. After several months of gloom and falling prices, particularly in London, both the Halifax and Nationwide indices showed last week that prices had ticked up during the month. Nationwide even stuck its neck out with a bullish forecast of rising prices in 2001. </p> <p>Adding fuel to the argument that the market may have turned are figures this week from Bradford &amp; Bingley Estate Agents, which show that the number of buyers in the market far exceeds the number of sellers, particularly for higher-priced homes. </p> <p>Bradford &amp; Bingley says that if you have the right property which has been put on to the market at the right price, then you can still sell quickly. </p> <p>The most speedy transactions - with homes going in less than one week - have been taking place in Yarm and Stokesley in the north east and Bramhall in the West Midlands, while homes in Burgess Hill in West Sussex, Alton and Liss in Hampshire, Sidcup in Kent, Redditch in Worcestershire, Maldon in Essex and Ivybridge in Dartmoor have all sold within a fortnight. It shows that looking at the house market from a north/south perspective is becoming increasingly outdated. </p> <p>There have been large upswings in demand for houses in the north and Scotland which shows up on the Bradford &amp; Bingley survey under the \"ratio of buyers registering to properties available\". Back in January this was 4:1 in Scotland and 3:1 in the north, whereas now that has rocketed to 10:1 and 5:1 respectively. </p> <p>However, the south and south east remain the markets where properties sell most quickly - in contrast to reports that the market has slowed down. The average detached property in these areas is selling in eight weeks, with the average flat being snapped up in six weeks and bungalows taking seven to sell. This compares with a nationwide average of nine weeks. </p> <p>The average number of viewings before a sale is agreed ranges from five for a terraced property in Scotland to 16 for a detached house in the same region. </p> <p>Ian Davies, regional business director for B&amp;B estate agents in the south east, says: \"In the south if you have a property to sell in the majority of cases if you price it realistically you will find a buyer, although the market is more competitive.\" </p> <p>The percentage of the asking price eventually paid by a buyer is another good indication of market strength; any house can sell quickly if the owner is prepared to heavily mark down the price. But again the B&amp;B figures show that this is not happening. The national average for the percentage of the asking price compared to the price paid is 97%. This is slightly lower in the North (96%) and much higher in Scotland (105%), but the latter is due to differences in the system of house purchase north of the border, where it is quite usual to ask for \"offers in excess of\" a certain amount. </p> <p>So, how can buyers increase their chances of getting the property they want? Jim Jamison, chief operating officer at B&amp;B estate agents, says: \"Since our last report was issued, we have seen a growing trend towards tactical selling. </p> <p>\"When the market was at a peak earlier in the year, people were finding a property before putting their own on the market. Fortunately we are now seeing evidence of people selling their own property at the same time or even before looking to buy the home of their dreams. </p> <p>\"With good quality and realistically priced homes continuing selling quickly, our advice is to put your house on the market before you start looking to buy.\" </p> <p>Nationwide argues that buyers have time on their side - but not much. It is forecasting a relatively quiet market over the next few months and then an upward surge in prices next spring. </p> <p>\"An upward trend in house price inflation is likely to recur, although it may not be until next spring. By this time first-time buyers will be more confident that the housing market is running at a sustainable rate and this, combined with higher real take-home pay should lead to a resurgence in the market,\" says a spokesman. </p>",

After several months of gloom and falling prices, particularly in London, both the Halifax and Nationwide indices showed last week that prices had ticked up during the month. Nationwide even stuck its neck out with a bullish forecast of rising prices in 2001. Adding fuel to the argument that the market may have turned are figures this week from Bradford &amp; Bingley Estate Agents, which show that the number of buyers in the market far exceeds the number of sellers, particularly for higher-priced homes. Bradford &amp; Bingley says that if you have the right property which has been put on to the market at the right price, then you can still sell quickly. The most speedy transactions - with homes going in less than one week - have been taking place in Yarm and Stokesley in the north east and Bramhall in the West Midlands, while homes in Burgess Hill in West Sussex, Alton and Liss in Hampshire, Sidcup in Kent, Redditch in Worcestershire, Maldon in Essex and Ivybridge in Dartmoor have all sold within a fortnight. It shows that looking at the house market from a north/south perspective is becoming increasingly outdated. There have been large upswings in demand for houses in the north and Scotland which shows up on the Bradford &amp; Bingley survey under the \"ratio of buyers registering to properties available\". Back in January this was 4:1 in Scotland and 3:1 in the north, whereas now that has rocketed to 10:1 and 5:1 respectively. However, the south and south east remain the markets where properties sell most quickly - in contrast to reports that the market has slowed down. The average detached property in these areas is selling in eight weeks, with the average flat being snapped up in six weeks and bungalows taking seven to sell. This compares with a nationwide average of nine weeks. The average number of viewings before a sale is agreed ranges from five for a terraced property in Scotland to 16 for a detached house in the same region. Ian Davies, regional business director for B&amp;B estate agents in the south east, says: \"In the south if you have a property to sell in the majority of cases if you price it realistically you will find a buyer, although the market is more competitive.\" The percentage of the asking price eventually paid by a buyer is another good indication of market strength; any house can sell quickly if the owner is prepared to heavily mark down the price. But again the B&amp;B figures show that this is not happening. The national average for the percentage of the asking price compared to the price paid is 97%. This is slightly lower in the North (96%) and much higher in Scotland (105%), but the latter is due to differences in the system of house purchase north of the border, where it is quite usual to ask for \"offers in excess of\" a certain amount. So, how can buyers increase their chances of getting the property they want? Jim Jamison, chief operating officer at B&amp;B estate agents, says: \"Since our last report was issued, we have seen a growing trend towards tactical selling. \"When the market was at a peak earlier in the year, people were finding a property before putting their own on the market. Fortunately we are now seeing evidence of people selling their own property at the same time or even before looking to buy the home of their dreams. \"With good quality and realistically priced homes continuing selling quickly, our advice is to put your house on the market before you start looking to buy.\" Nationwide argues that buyers have time on their side - but not much. It is forecasting a relatively quiet market over the next few months and then an upward surge in prices next spring. \"An upward trend in house price inflation is likely to recur, although it may not be until next spring. By this time first-time buyers will be more confident that the housing market is running at a sustainable rate and this, combined with higher real take-home pay should lead to a resurgence in the market,\" says a spokesman.",

It unveiled a new range of credit cards with low introductory rates, particularly if you are transferring your business to Halifax from a rival. </p> <p>The Platinum card, which is aimed at customers with a household income of more than \u00a325,000 who need a credit limit in excess of \u00a33,500, has a rate of 2.9% for the first five months for balance transfers, rising to 16.9% at the end of that period. If you take out a card without transferring a balance the rate is 16.9% from day one. </p> <p>The Gold card rate is 3.9% for five months and then 16.9%, again for transferring balances. It is aimed at people whose household income is more than \u00a320,000. The credit limit on this card is \u00a33,000. </p> <p>The bank is also relaunching its Classic Visa card with an introductory rate of 3.9%, rising to 17.9%, both for transferring balances and new transactions. Halifax says the launches are part of its strategy to double its 1.5m base of credit card customers within the next three years. \"Customers taking out a Halifax Platinum card and transferring \u00a31,200 from their Barclaycard, for example, would save more than \u00a3100 in the first year,\" says James Corcoran, managing director of Halifax Card Services. </p> <p>However, although the introductory rates are rated the best on the high street, and the standard rates are among the lowest (the HSBC Gold and Platinum card are cheaper than their Halifax equivalents, for instance), there are better rates available from non-high street providers. Capital One charges 0% for six months, reverting to 12.9% and Egg charges 2.5% initially on debt transfers, which then reverts to 10.9% after six months. </p> <p>But Abbey National says that research it has conducted among 4,000 people shows that just 5% switch credit card provider in search of a better rate. It also showed that while 77% of people have considered moving to another card issuer, 42% say the process is too much hassle.</p>",

If you take out a card without transferring a balance the rate is 16.9% from day one. The Gold card rate is 3.9% for five months and then 16.9%, again for transferring balances. It is aimed at people whose household income is more than \u00a320,000. The credit limit on this card is \u00a33,000. The bank is also relaunching its Classic Visa card with an introductory rate of 3.9%, rising to 17.9%, both for transferring balances and new transactions. Halifax says the launches are part of its strategy to double its 1.5m base of credit card customers within the next three years. \"Customers taking out a Halifax Platinum card and transferring \u00a31,200 from their Barclaycard, for example, would save more than \u00a3100 in the first year,\" says James Corcoran, managing director of Halifax Card Services. However, although the introductory rates are rated the best on the high street, and the standard rates are among the lowest (the HSBC Gold and Platinum card are cheaper than their Halifax equivalents, for instance), there are better rates available from non-high street providers. Capital One charges 0% for six months, reverting to 12.9% and Egg charges 2.5% initially on debt transfers, which then reverts to 10.9% after six months. But Abbey National says that research it has conducted among 4,000 people shows that just 5% switch credit card provider in search of a better rate. It also showed that while 77% of people have considered moving to another card issuer, 42% say the process is too much hassle.",

Or the moment where somebody shouts \"Boring!\" and the outraged singer hurls himself into the crowd, ending up biting the end off his microphone. It could be the hilarious anecdote about attempting to sing on Later with Jools Holland (tonight on BBC2) while being forced to stare at the En Vogue singer's \"52DDD cleavage\".

By the look of things he's been there ever since. </p> <p>A bottle of Jack Daniel's perches precariously on his keyboard. He makes speeches of variable hilarity and sobriety which involve the words \"fuck\", \"press\" and \"tits\". Badly Drawn Boy has made his name on shambolic performances, but with tuneless guitars, mauled Bruce Springsteen anthems, collapsing songs, audience abuse, unlistenable 10-minute jams and the occasional flight of utter genius, this really takes the biscuit. </p> <p>Imagine - if you dare - a cross between Ray Davies playing Haight Ashbury, Les Dawson's Terrible Pianist and Ollie Reed on After Dark. It's that bad. And that good. And, often, somewhere bewildering in between. Weirder still, it's suspiciously like an act. The Jack Daniel's is rarely troubled, and some songs/witticisms are delivered so impeccably that this man could simply not be that drunk (either way, he's almost as good an actor as Ollie). So is this \"performance\" myth-making, or marketing, or both? Gough professes to hate the music industry, but his shenanigans are no less a gimmick than Britney Spears's school uniform. </p> <p>Equally, BDB rightly champions the cause of live spontaneity, but when even the prearranged slide show proclaims \"Sham Bollock\", you know that you're in the realms of at least semi-scripted chaos. </p> <p>After two hours, six premature slurs of \"Goodnight\" and a genuinely terrifying moment where he makes as if to take his clothes off, Damon finally delivers the gorgeous bittersweet anthems people have paid for. Pissing in the Wind, Disillusion and The Shining are worthy of any prize you care to name, but Gough doubly plays with fire. </p> <p>Just as Hendrix came to hate the way people remembered him setting fire to his guitar more than his music, Townshend rued the guitarsmashing.

And the good that can be taken from the experience of England's performances against Germany and Finland is the knowledge that an era is over. All that is required now is a commitment to accept the new reality and to act on it. </p> <p>So thank you David Seaman, for the service represented by your 62 caps. At least you can say you went out with a clean sheet to your name. Thank you Tony Adams and Martin Keown, with more than a hundred caps between you, for your wholehearted efforts. </p> <p>Thank you Paul Ince, for a handful of heroic performances, although you never quite realised that a truly great player's commitment to his squad is not conditional on the fluctuations of his own personal fortunes. Thank you Dennis Wise and Gareth Southgate and David Batty and Sol Campbell and Paul Scholes and Graeme le Saux and Philip and Gary Neville, proven Premier League professionals who never quite convinced the jury of an ability to make the transition to international football. Thank you Nick Barmby and Ray Parlour and all the other middle-to-late twentysomethings whose chances were comparatively few but who, if they were ever going to make authentic international footballers, would have done so by now. And thank you to Andrew Cole, a much better footballer than your international record might suggest, although 10 England appearances without a goal is enough of a chance for anyone. Thank you one and all. And goodnight. </p> <p>Five-and-a-half months in the future lies the next Group Nine fixture, the return leg against Finland. By that time England will have a new head coach. And we shall know that the appointment has failed if the next incumbent finds himself scratching his head over the choice between Parlour and Ince, Le Saux and Phil Neville, Keown and Southgate. For that way lies nothing more than a repetition of the past. </p> <p>Kevin Keegan took the rap for the failure against Germany. Coaches are important to the success of a football team, but players also have some say in the conduct of a match. And through their performances on Saturday and Wednesday, the majority of this bunch indicated that they are just not up to it. Hence the necessity for a mass valediction. </p> <p>Who or what comes in to fill the vacuum? It can only be one thing: a commitment to the crop of outstanding young players it is England's good fortune to possess. They may have appeared merely by coincidence, or their arrival may have been the result of the now-abandoned Lilleshall experiment, but they certainly exist. And under Peter Taylor those players coalesced into a group, in the guise of the Under-21 squad. So now they know each other well, having played together in qualifying groups and tournaments. With England in such disarray, here is an asset which must not be overlooked. </p> <p>The answer is to promote them now, virtually en bloc. To make way, anybody in the existing squad over the age of 22, with three exceptions: Nigel Martyn, at 34 the only short-term selection (with Richard Wright at his eventual replacement), to add stability to the defence; David Beckham, a certifiably world-class player; and Steve McManaman. No, McManaman is not getting a game for Real Madrid at the moment. But the best player on the pitch in Helsinki was Jari Litmanen, who is being similarly ignored at Barcelona. The Finns know Litmanen's value, even if the Catalan's coach Lorenzo Serra Ferrer has forgotten it, and McManaman would benefit from a similar show of faith. </p> <p>Martyn, Beckham and McManaman would be joined by the Under-23s from the present squad - Michael Owen, Rio Ferdinand, Kieron Dyer, Wes Brown, Gareth Barry and Steven Gerrard - and by the cream of the recent Under-21 squad, such as Joe Cole, Jon Harley, Michael Carrick and Carl Cort. If some of them were having trouble holding a place in the first teams of their overmanned clubs, thanks to pressure from foreign players, then the coach would have to back his own judgment against that of a Claudio Ranieri or an Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, and to transmit that confidence to the players. </p> <p>Howard Wilkinson, too cautious by far, is emphatically not the man to take charge of them. The poor showing of his Under-21s in the European championship finals last May proved that much. Let him go back to organising the national coaching schemes, where his admiration of the French system can do most good. The only possible choice is Peter Taylor, whose Under-21 side won games by playing in a progressive style which had less to do with national stereotypes than with world trends. </p> <p>Earlier this week Taylor honourably said that he would not be prepared to leave Leicester City in the short term, having recently persuaded several players to extend their contracts. In that case the Football Association ought to be prepared to wait for him until the end of the season, having agreed a substantial amount of compensation with his club. Meanwhile, Taylor would look after the England team on a part-time basis, with the help, if necessary, of Bobby Robson. </p> <p>This means that the next round of World Cup qualifying matches, and the friendlies which precede them, would be undertaken without a full-time coach, and with a fledgling squad. If that were to mean forfeiting qualification for 2002, so be it. The priorities are elsewhere. Imagine how much they would learn together from the experience, and how much stronger they would be when, as a mature squad, they faced their next challenge - qualification for Euro 2004, itself viewed as a stepping stone to the 2006 World Cup. </p> <p>Yesterday Glenn Hoddle and Howard Wilkinson separately stressed the importance, in England's present position, of placing long-term planning ahead of short-term results. The FA have an opportunity now to get it right, and to take the public along with them. No one wants to see any more performances like those witnessed twice in the past week. For once, the bold step is likely to win more approval than the quick fix. The chance is there, and they had better not let it slip. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Martyn, Beckham and McManaman would be joined by the Under-23s from the present squad - Michael Owen, Rio Ferdinand, Kieron Dyer, Wes Brown, Gareth Barry and Steven Gerrard - and by the cream of the recent Under-21 squad, such as Joe Cole, Jon Harley, Michael Carrick and Carl Cort. If some of them were having trouble holding a place in the first teams of their overmanned clubs, thanks to pressure from foreign players, then the coach would have to back his own judgment against that of a Claudio Ranieri or an Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, and to transmit that confidence to the players. Howard Wilkinson, too cautious by far, is emphatically not the man to take charge of them. The poor showing of his Under-21s in the European championship finals last May proved that much. Let him go back to organising the national coaching schemes, where his admiration of the French system can do most good. The only possible choice is Peter Taylor, whose Under-21 side won games by playing in a progressive style which had less to do with national stereotypes than with world trends. Earlier this week Taylor honourably said that he would not be prepared to leave Leicester City in the short term, having recently persuaded several players to extend their contracts. In that case the Football Association ought to be prepared to wait for him until the end of the season, having agreed a substantial amount of compensation with his club. Meanwhile, Taylor would look after the England team on a part-time basis, with the help, if necessary, of Bobby Robson. This means that the next round of World Cup qualifying matches, and the friendlies which precede them, would be undertaken without a full-time coach, and with a fledgling squad. If that were to mean forfeiting qualification for 2002, so be it. The priorities are elsewhere. Imagine how much they would learn together from the experience, and how much stronger they would be when, as a mature squad, they faced their next challenge - qualification for Euro 2004, itself viewed as a stepping stone to the 2006 World Cup. Yesterday Glenn Hoddle and Howard Wilkinson separately stressed the importance, in England's present position, of placing long-term planning ahead of short-term results. The FA have an opportunity now to get it right, and to take the public along with them. No one wants to see any more performances like those witnessed twice in the past week. For once, the bold step is likely to win more approval than the quick fix. The chance is there, and they had better not let it slip. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Shakoor Rana says Mike Gatting is his favourite cricketer and that he is welcome to stay with him in Lahore. But after 13 years the umpire still persists with the outlandish claim that the England captain was cheating when Anglo-Pakistani tensions exploded at Faisalabad. </p> <p>A gloriously unrepentant Shakoor, 63 and now an assistant sports officer with Pakistan Railways, also says England \"cannot win\" in Pakistan this winter and has attacked the decision not to tour the country in the past 13 years. </p> <p>\"I do not know why England does not come,\" he said. \"It is not my fault. But it is England's bad luck. If they came to Pakistan they might have learned to play spin bowling, which they can't. </p> <p>\"I do not regret what happened. England should regret it. They lost a day's play from a match they were winning. How can I regret? It made me the most famous umpire. People don't recognise me now, but when I introduce myself everyone says: 'Ah, yes, the famous umpire.' \" </p> <p>Infamous might be more appropriate. It was the awful umpiring in 1987-88, most notably by Shakoor and Shakeel Khan, that paved the way for neutral officials and helped dissuade England from touring the country. Next week they return for the first time for an official tour. </p> <p>\"Mike Gatting is a good person,\" said Shakoor, who even before the England series 13 years ago kept a proudly thumbed cuttings book in which he was described as \"The World's Worst Umpire\". \"He is my favourite cricketer. He can play spin bowling. If he comes here I would like him to be a guest in my house. </p> <p>\"He is not a cheat. But that day in Faisalabad he cheated. I don't know why. I think he lost his temper after losing the Test in Lahore. And after cheating he started abusing me. My code of honour allows me to kill a man who insults me. </p> <p>\"But he wrote me a note of apology. I used to keep it under my pillow. Now I have it in a drawer. But it is a closed chapter. </p> <p>\"I came to England a few years ago to see my son, Mansoor, who was playing in the Bradford League. I saw Gatting sitting in a car. I went over because I wanted to talk to him and shake his hand. But he said 'Oh God, not you again' and drove off.\" </p> <p>Even by the Byzantine standards of Pakistani cricket the tour of 1987-88 was something else. It was probably the most acrimonious series played since Bodyline. And even that schism of 1932-33 was followed by another England tour to Australia four years later. </p> <p>The furious, finger-pointing exchange between Shakoor and Gatting was more than a mere cricket row. They stuck the picture on front pages all over the world, even in Germany. There were colonial overtones.

      "bodyText": "Shakoor Rana says Mike Gatting is his favourite cricketer and that he is welcome to stay with him in Lahore. But after 13 years the umpire still persists with the outlandish claim that the England captain was cheating when Anglo-Pakistani tensions exploded at Faisalabad. A gloriously unrepentant Shakoor, 63 and now an assistant sports officer with Pakistan Railways, also says England \"cannot win\" in Pakistan this winter and has attacked the decision not to tour the country in the past 13 years. \"I do not know why England does not come,\" he said. \"It is not my fault. But it is England's bad luck. If they came to Pakistan they might have learned to play spin bowling, which they can't. \"I do not regret what happened. England should regret it. They lost a day's play from a match they were winning. How can I regret? It made me the most famous umpire. People don't recognise me now, but when I introduce myself everyone says: 'Ah, yes, the famous umpire.' \" Infamous might be more appropriate. It was the awful umpiring in 1987-88, most notably by Shakoor and Shakeel Khan, that paved the way for neutral officials and helped dissuade England from touring the country. Next week they return for the first time for an official tour. \"Mike Gatting is a good person,\" said Shakoor, who even before the England series 13 years ago kept a proudly thumbed cuttings book in which he was described as \"The World's Worst Umpire\". \"He is my favourite cricketer. He can play spin bowling. If he comes here I would like him to be a guest in my house. \"He is not a cheat. But that day in Faisalabad he cheated. I don't know why. I think he lost his temper after losing the Test in Lahore. And after cheating he started abusing me. My code of honour allows me to kill a man who insults me. \"But he wrote me a note of apology. I used to keep it under my pillow. Now I have it in a drawer. But it is a closed chapter. \"I came to England a few years ago to see my son, Mansoor, who was playing in the Bradford League. I saw Gatting sitting in a car. I went over because I wanted to talk to him and shake his hand. But he said 'Oh God, not you again' and drove off.\" Even by the Byzantine standards of Pakistani cricket the tour of 1987-88 was something else. It was probably the most acrimonious series played since Bodyline. And even that schism of 1932-33 was followed by another England tour to Australia four years later. The furious, finger-pointing exchange between Shakoor and Gatting was more than a mere cricket row. They stuck the picture on front pages all over the world, even in Germany. There were colonial overtones. And the image of an angry England captain at odds with a foreign umpire was symbolically represented as another sign of a once great nation's terminal decline. The flashpoint came at the end of the second day of the second Test in Faisalabad, when Gatting signalled David Capel to come up from deep square-leg to save a single. He had, he said later, informed the batsman, Salim Malik, of the field change, though this had increasingly become the job of the non-striker.

A mutual apology was brokered before the Pakistan captain, Javed Miandad, persuaded Shakoor to stand firm.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>ARSENE'S IN CHARGE</strong></p> <p>Arsene Wenger certainly knows how to deal with the FA. Scarcely minutes after ruling himself out of the running for the vacant England job - \"the England job is an attractive one, but someone else will be taking it, not me\" - the no-nonsense Arsenal manager announced his intention to take the hapless footballing body through the courts. </p> <p>A serene Wenger explained today that he is not best pleased with his recent 12-match ban for physically threatening behaviour. \"Maybe I went to the meeting expecting some kind of small punishment, perhaps a fine,\" he mused, \"but this is far, far too much, and I will certainly consult a lawyer. It is not only harsh, it is an injustice. I feel like I have killed somebody.\"</p> <p>But just for the record, Arsene doesn't hate David Davies's very guts. That's because, although Arsene is hard (and he is), he's also fair. Showing a willingness to forgive and forget, Wenger today conceded that he may be prepared to coach England. When he is good and ready. \"I wouldn't say no to the manager's job if I was completely free,\" he said, \"but at the moment I give my all to Arsenal. Maybe in two or three years I will change my mind.\" This sounds fine to the Fiver - any major lawsuits should have been dealt with by then.</p> <p><strong>A LOVELY TALE</strong></p> <p>The Fiver spent most of Wednesday evening hurling a thesaurus's worth of profanities at u&gt;direct's u&gt;seless coverage. And when the TV wasn't incurring our wrath, French referee Alain Sars took up the slack. \"Off, off, off!\" we cried when Teddy Sheringham was tripped - only to see Monsieur Sars furiously shake his Gallic head. \"Go-aaalllllllllll!\" we cheered, as Romford Ray's rocket crashed off the bar and in - only for Sars to deny us again. Never mind, we thought - when Sars talks to the press, he wouldn't deny us our justice for a third time, would he?</p> <p>\"I don't feel responsible for England's defeat at all and anyway they had only one real opportunity to score,\" Mr Sars said today, knocking the Fiver's socks off. What about the sending off? \"In such a case a referee wonders if that player really had a chance to score,\" Sars pondered. \"I saw two Finnish defenders who could have intercepted the ball if Sheringham had shot. I assessed the striker had been tripped and that the keeper deserved a yellow card.\"</p> <p>\"Alright then, what about Romford Ray's wonder-goal?\" we seethed - but even that was not Sar's fault. \"How do you think an assistant can see where the ball bounced,\" he said, \"when it's just hit the crossbar at 150 kilometres-per-hour and comes out straight away?\" By using his eyes perhaps?</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"It looks like a classic case of a bandwagon effect snowballing out of control\" - A classic case of mixed metaphors as William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe explains why odds on Lazio's Sven Goran Eriksson for next England manager tumbled from 33/1 to 3/1.</p> <p><strong>SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GO BACKWARDS TO MOVE FORWARDS</strong></p> <p>Gerard Houllier today took a step closer to realising his dream. By agreeing a \u00a37m deal with Dynamo Zagreb for Croatian international Igor Biscan, the Liverpool boss will soon be able to field a team consisting solely of defensive midfielders, thus unleashing his epochal 0-10-0 formation on a stunned footballing world. Biscan won't arrive until the mid-winter break in the Croatian season, mind you, so we'll have to put up with the tired old goal-seeking formation for a while yet.</p> <p>\"We will be delighted to have him, especially as so many other top European clubs were interested,\" babbled an over-excited Houllier as he imagined Biscan trapping a searching three-yard sideways pass from Jamie Carragher. \"He is an international player and a class player.

      "bodyText": "ARSENE'S IN CHARGE Arsene Wenger certainly knows how to deal with the FA. Scarcely minutes after ruling himself out of the running for the vacant England job - \"the England job is an attractive one, but someone else will be taking it, not me\" - the no-nonsense Arsenal manager announced his intention to take the hapless footballing body through the courts. A serene Wenger explained today that he is not best pleased with his recent 12-match ban for physically threatening behaviour. \"Maybe I went to the meeting expecting some kind of small punishment, perhaps a fine,\" he mused, \"but this is far, far too much, and I will certainly consult a lawyer. It is not only harsh, it is an injustice. I feel like I have killed somebody.\" But just for the record, Arsene doesn't hate David Davies's very guts. That's because, although Arsene is hard (and he is), he's also fair. Showing a willingness to forgive and forget, Wenger today conceded that he may be prepared to coach England. When he is good and ready. \"I wouldn't say no to the manager's job if I was completely free,\" he said, \"but at the moment I give my all to Arsenal. Maybe in two or three years I will change my mind.\" This sounds fine to the Fiver - any major lawsuits should have been dealt with by then. A LOVELY TALE The Fiver spent most of Wednesday evening hurling a thesaurus's worth of profanities at u&gt;direct's u&gt;seless coverage. And when the TV wasn't incurring our wrath, French referee Alain Sars took up the slack. \"Off, off, off!\" we cried when Teddy Sheringham was tripped - only to see Monsieur Sars furiously shake his Gallic head. \"Go-aaalllllllllll!\" we cheered, as Romford Ray's rocket crashed off the bar and in - only for Sars to deny us again. Never mind, we thought - when Sars talks to the press, he wouldn't deny us our justice for a third time, would he? \"I don't feel responsible for England's defeat at all and anyway they had only one real opportunity to score,\" Mr Sars said today, knocking the Fiver's socks off. What about the sending off? \"In such a case a referee wonders if that player really had a chance to score,\" Sars pondered. \"I saw two Finnish defenders who could have intercepted the ball if Sheringham had shot. I assessed the striker had been tripped and that the keeper deserved a yellow card.\" \"Alright then, what about Romford Ray's wonder-goal?\" we seethed - but even that was not Sar's fault. \"How do you think an assistant can see where the ball bounced,\" he said, \"when it's just hit the crossbar at 150 kilometres-per-hour and comes out straight away?\" By using his eyes perhaps? QUOTE OF THE DAY \"It looks like a classic case of a bandwagon effect snowballing out of control\" - A classic case of mixed metaphors as William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe explains why odds on Lazio's Sven Goran Eriksson for next England manager tumbled from 33/1 to 3/1. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GO BACKWARDS TO MOVE FORWARDS Gerard Houllier today took a step closer to realising his dream. By agreeing a \u00a37m deal with Dynamo Zagreb for Croatian international Igor Biscan, the Liverpool boss will soon be able to field a team consisting solely of defensive midfielders, thus unleashing his epochal 0-10-0 formation on a stunned footballing world. Biscan won't arrive until the mid-winter break in the Croatian season, mind you, so we'll have to put up with the tired old goal-seeking formation for a while yet. \"We will be delighted to have him, especially as so many other top European clubs were interested,\" babbled an over-excited Houllier as he imagined Biscan trapping a searching three-yard sideways pass from Jamie Carragher. \"He is an international player and a class player. We've been watching him for a long time,\" he chattered, picturing his new charge racing down the wing to stop a Dietmar Hamann back-pass going out for a corner. Of course, Biscan is a talented man - you don't get in the Croatian side at 22 years of age if you're no good. \"He is a versatile footballer as he showed against Scotland when he played on the right of midfield,\" explained his new boss, showing worrying cavalier tendencies. Luckily for Liverpool fans however, Houllier was quick to clear up any confusion: \"I see him as a defensive midfielder.\" So good luck with the new plan, Gerard, and remember: sideways pass and move, it's the Liverpool groove! THE RUMOUR MILL Both Newcastle and Celtic are lining up a bid for \u00a33m-rated Everton defender Richard Dunne, according to reports. West Ham have enquired about taking Torino defender Fabio Galante and midfielder Djibril Diawara on loan. Sunderland are interested in taking Sporting Lisbon striker Kwame Ayew on trial, reports Planet Football. The 26-year-old Ghanian international is also interesting Rangers, Fenerbahce and several Bundesliga clubs. NEWS IN BRIEF Rangers have finally agreed a deal for Espanyol's \u00a311m-rated striker Raul Tamudo. \"Rangers and Espanol have agreed terms subject to changes in the transfer system, which is currently under review,\" said a club statement. Ryan Giggs is close to agreeing a new five-year contract at Manchester United. \"We are still in talks at the moment, I have 18 months of my current contract left and I would like to get things all sorted out,\" he admitted. \"And I believe that will be done fairly soon, hopefully before Christmas time.\" Sheffield Wednesday have given a cautious welcome to the Hamed brothers' interest in the club.

      "bodyText": "It was always a dot.com disaster waiting to happen. From the moment that online delivery service Urbanfetch unveiled international expansion plans four months ago, everyone said it wouldn't last. \"A great idea and a fantastic service for consumers, but it's just not going to sustain itself\" was always the general market opinion, so it came as no surprise whatsoever when Urbanfetch waved the white flag on its consumer operation last night. Signs posted on the company websites today declare \"It was a pleasure to serve you\" and \"It is with great regret that we will be closing our doors. We've enjoyed serving you, London.\" The firm is wrapping up by having a farewell sale and knocking off up to 50% on its products to clear its stock and close up shop in about a week's time. Why did Urbanfetch fail? Simple mathematics really. The company offered free delivery on all items that had practically no mark-up - the idea being to develop consumer demand, build market share and then fingers crossed, it would become a thriving operation.

Mr Bannister said that he was \"going to carry on full-tilt until December 15\". \"I hope that when I go I will have left behind a marketing strategy, a budget for the next 18 months and plans for the first phase of cost savings [for the BBC marketing and communications division].\"",

Israeli officials confirmed that the terms of a summit were being negotiated, but said no agreement had been reached yet. But as diplomatic moves gathered pace, a gun battle erupted between Israeli troops and Palestinian gunmen in the volatile West Bank town of Ramallah, the scene of a mob killing yesterday of two Israeli soldiers. In Jerusalem, Israeli police beat back young Palestinians outside a revered mosque. However, Israel and the Palestinians appeared to be moving toward a summit that would be held tomorrow or Sunday in Egypt, according to senior Palestinian officials. The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak are both expected to attend the talks, the officials said. The final details had not been worked out, and the Israelis and Palestinians were not dealing directly with each other, the officials added. As a condition for attending the summit, the Palestinians are demanding that Israel withdraw its troops from the outskirts of Palestinian cities and lift its siege of their communities in the West Bank. Mr Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, confirmed that negotiations on a summit were under way, but nothing had been decided. World leaders have sought to calm two weeks of fighting that escalated yesterday when the two Israeli soldiers were mutilated by a mob of enraged Palestinians. Israel responded with combat helicopters that fired rockets at key Palestinian targets, including Arafat's residential compound in the Gaza Strip.

      "body": "<p>This week's story is how Paris got its groove back. After the best part of a decade spent in the shadows of Milan, this week's catwalk shows proved that the French capital is firmly back in the frame. A city to which international designers have traditionally flocked, Paris is currently home to many of the most exciting design talents from America and Britain, Belgium and Holland. The fashion industry is reaping the rewards of a buoyant economy and even the perennial criticism of Paris, that it lacks what Stella McCartney calls \"a vibe\", is faltering in the face of a burgeoning music scene and a clutch of alternative style magazines. </p> <p>One important element of the renaissance will come under the spotlight tonight, when Tom Ford unveils his first collection for Yves Saint Laurent. Ford's newly divided loyalties in his first season flitting between the vaunted Parisian house and Gucci are important both practically and symbolically: the Ford-led Gucci revival was, along with the success of Prada, the driving force behind the 90s coup in which Milan effectively dethroned Paris. </p> <p>But whatever happens tonight, Paris has already proved itself this week. By striking a balance - more edgy than New York, not as harsh as London or as over-enthusiastic as Milan - Paris made sense of trends that have weaved through a month of shows. Designers grasped how to do edgy that wasn't ugly, desirable that wasn't flash. They also attempted to get to grips with two trends that look set to fox us next season: strange sleeve shapes and full skirts. </p> <p>Sleeves as you or I know them were nowhere to be found on this season's catwalks. In their place were pieces of fabric flapping over the shoulder, as if the designer had been going to make sleeves but ran out of time. Or there were sleeves, but slit from shoulder to wrist. What vexed me most were the kimono and batwing sleeves, where the armhole starts almost at the waist. </p> <p>Still, they do look nice. In Chloe's ladylike collection, they gave a modern slant to fitted, pleated skirts that might otherwise have looked a little Miss Marple; teamed with the house's signature sexy trousers, they formed a striking new silhouette. In Martine Sitbon's collection, they featured on dresses in distressed red silk and sequined black crepe. At Gaspard Yurkievich's hip show, they were part of an upturned triangular silhouette: black satin and rubber dresses had voluminous shoulders and a generous hood, and narrowed to skim the hips. </p> <p>If the sleeve took some getting used to, the jury is still out on the full skirt. A circle skirt to the knee, given volume by pleats or folds, and accented with a wide belt or waistband, was a key item in many collections. Issey Miyake presented the most interesting take, with skirts given a puffball shape by feathers or paper flowers trapped in between net petticoats. At Louis Vuitton, full skirts came in rose-printed mosquito net fabric; at Givenchy, they were statuesque as wedding cakes in layers of piped organza, or scalloped leather over net. </p> <p>Here and elsewhere they were worn with quiffs that gave a 50s flavour and an androgynous edge to the exaggerated womanly shape of the skirts. Androgyny was also in the air at Viktor &amp; Rolf, where bobbed dancers wore buttermilk blazers with frilly shirts and ties - and the designers took to the floor for the final routine. </p> <p>The problem with androgyny is that too often it boils down to women wearing things that look better on men. Drainpipe trousers, for instance. True, on the catwalk they look striking in contrast to voluminous blouses or 80s shoulder-padded jackets. But this look works only with the pipe cleaner-sized trousers catwalk models can get into: if your drainpipe-clad bottom half looks as wide as your batwing-clad top half, it's a recipe for disaster. </p> <p>Print is another trend that will take some getting used to, but there were plenty of wearable versions in Paris: florals at Dries van Noten, Chinese-style pagoda prints at Cacharel. Chiffon - especially pleated, as at Valentino - looks likely to be unavoidable, too. Safari styling cropped up at Louis Vuitton and at Celine, where Michael Kors cited as his inspiration \"Bowie and Iman take off with Bianca and Beard for the ultimate luxe safari\". </p> <p> Some designers avoided trends by being too outr\u00e9, or not outr\u00e9 enough. Christian Dior came in the first category with a dizzying deconstructed version of a trailer-park beauty pageant. Galliano's prodigious talent is unarguable and only Jean Paul Gaultier could match his ebullience: his motorcycle leather shoulder shrugs and slashed tunics, with models swigging from beer cans, were Braveheart meets The Wild One. </p> <p>At the other extreme, Colette Dinnigan would probably faint if faced with a slashed tunic. Her collection featured lashings of sequins, chiffon and lace on truly scrumptious dresses. For sheer beauty, it was pipped to the post only by Emanuel Ungaro, who have long been associated with a particular type of sugar-dusted super-femininity, but are moving on to fresher pastures. Appliqu\u00e9 petals stitched loosely on to fluid crepe dresses looked modern, while trouser suits with ribbon-wide chiffon trim looked phenomenal in neon zebra stripes on Alek Wek. In the real world, they'll sell like hot brioches in palest French manicure pink.</p>",

      "body": "<p> Ahhh, romantic Paris at night. It was raining. Not the kind of grey drizzle you expect in London. This was real rain - fat ploppy drops that send your hair into ringlets and your mascara into dark, intriguing smudges. No cabs, no parapluie. I stood under a doorway watching embracing couples dashing from awning to awning. Occasionally they stopped and kissed. The man sheltering next to me smiled and nodded at the sky. \"You need taxi?\" I nodded. That was how I found myself skimming across Paris in the back of a cab with a (very) handsome Frenchman. Only turns out he was an Italian living in France. Signor Cornetto with a side dish of Gaul. The Paris fashion week after-show party season was under way. If London is pointless (any excuse for a bash) and Milan relies on a point (any excuse to earn a million or so), the Paris after-show party is pointedly sexual - any chance of a quickie? \"I lurrrve you young fashion girrrls who are independent and trrravel all overrr the worrrld.\" </p> <p>\"Actually, I'm married.\" </p> <p>\"I lurrrve you marrrried fashion women who are dependent and trrravel only occasionally.\" Yawn. </p> <p> First stop, some Brits abroad - four young designers had taken it upon themselves to hire a studio space and exhibit their wares in the heart of Europe's fashland. Eley Kishimoto (print-meisters - love the tights), Jessica Ogden (has a way with embroidery threads and print effects), Mulligan (top collection of asymmetric cuts and corsage details) and J Maskray (queen of stick-on sequins) had all been around at London but felt that exposure in Paris may bring extra international business. The party was low-key, conveniently so considering my dramatic trip at the entrance. Sliding around the exhibits, I found a video screening at the back and settled down to watch J Maskray's London presentation. Now, some people would flinch at an array of skin jewellery displayed on lap dancers. I, on the other hand, joined a group of French buyers who were clearly weaned off breast milk with soft porn. The glittering dragons' heads adhering to the writhing naked bodies were stunning. My pen flew across my notepad. Only after 10 minutes did I realise that, apart from the leech, I was alone in my viewing and the newly assembled crowd were watching me watching the show. Had anyone told them this was an alternative fashion show? I think not. \"Oh look, there's an old pervert in the corner with a leery Italian watching a porn vid.\" Blushed? </p> <p> Quick exit to wittily named Fur-midable - a cocktail party coutesy of Saga furs. Now, before you start, I don't approve of the use of fur in fashion either - but that shouldn't stop you attending. \"Kate Adie doesn't approve of war,\" I told myself, \"but that doesn't stop her going.\" Opinions suspended, I relinquished my handbag for an offensive weapons check and entered the fur-torn world of Saga. Champagne and hors d'oeuvres jostled for attention with electric blue mink-covered washbasin units and a bathroom mirror trimmed in bleached fox tails. Languorous models pawed at each other with all the \"luxury-prop\" realism of a Wallpaper magazine interiors shoot. Bad enough that those dear wee minkies have been turned into cuffs, muffs and collars. More terrible still, though, is the fact that their lives had been cut short to become... a tissue box cover or a classic novel binding. Need I say more? The only good thing: the assembled throng took not a blind bit of notice but remained adhered to the buffet table until the nibbles and champagne ran dry. </p> <p> On to a photography exhibition (of which there are many this week) by... well, d'ya know, I don't remember, since my invite got washed clean by the rain and there wasn't a biog to hand (agent, take note). But it turned out to be yet another excuse to knock back champagne. There were lots of fashion celebs there, though, looking at photos of lots of fashion celebs. For them, in fact, it became a Question of Sport-style game, where you see a bit of someone and you have to guess who it is. \"Look, there's me\"; \"Look, that's my leg next to Juergen Teller.\" This pastime, I assure you, may well be fun if it might be your leg. Not so great if it assuredly isn't.</p>",

The party was low-key, conveniently so considering my dramatic trip at the entrance. Sliding around the exhibits, I found a video screening at the back and settled down to watch J Maskray's London presentation. Now, some people would flinch at an array of skin jewellery displayed on lap dancers. I, on the other hand, joined a group of French buyers who were clearly weaned off breast milk with soft porn. The glittering dragons' heads adhering to the writhing naked bodies were stunning. My pen flew across my notepad. Only after 10 minutes did I realise that, apart from the leech, I was alone in my viewing and the newly assembled crowd were watching me watching the show. Had anyone told them this was an alternative fashion show? I think not. \"Oh look, there's an old pervert in the corner with a leery Italian watching a porn vid.\" Blushed? Quick exit to wittily named Fur-midable - a cocktail party coutesy of Saga furs. Now, before you start, I don't approve of the use of fur in fashion either - but that shouldn't stop you attending. \"Kate Adie doesn't approve of war,\" I told myself, \"but that doesn't stop her going.\" Opinions suspended, I relinquished my handbag for an offensive weapons check and entered the fur-torn world of Saga. Champagne and hors d'oeuvres jostled for attention with electric blue mink-covered washbasin units and a bathroom mirror trimmed in bleached fox tails. Languorous models pawed at each other with all the \"luxury-prop\" realism of a Wallpaper magazine interiors shoot. Bad enough that those dear wee minkies have been turned into cuffs, muffs and collars. More terrible still, though, is the fact that their lives had been cut short to become... a tissue box cover or a classic novel binding. Need I say more? The only good thing: the assembled throng took not a blind bit of notice but remained adhered to the buffet table until the nibbles and champagne ran dry. On to a photography exhibition (of which there are many this week) by... well, d'ya know, I don't remember, since my invite got washed clean by the rain and there wasn't a biog to hand (agent, take note). But it turned out to be yet another excuse to knock back champagne. There were lots of fashion celebs there, though, looking at photos of lots of fashion celebs. For them, in fact, it became a Question of Sport-style game, where you see a bit of someone and you have to guess who it is. \"Look, there's me\"; \"Look, that's my leg next to Juergen Teller.\" This pastime, I assure you, may well be fun if it might be your leg. Not so great if it assuredly isn't.",

No one is ever really sure where mad ideas like this come from, though it could be traced to a backlash against the mid to late 90s American modern thing.

      "body": "<p>The invitation to Ariel Sharon to join a new coalition government is a reflection of grimmest reality: Israel is on the brink of war, and in wartime the country always has a government of national unity.</p> <p>Sharon, 72, has no shortage of admirers on the Israeli right, who see him as a hero, and no shortage of detractors, who see him as a dangerous rogue.</p> <p>Palestinians generally have no such equivocation. They loathe the man. Arabs insist that it was Sharon's visit to the Haram al-Sharif mosque complex in Jerusalem on September 28 which sparked the latest bloodletting.</p> <p>But their passionate dislike of the Likud leader goes back much, much further.</p> <p>Nearly half a century ago, Sharon was winning a reputation in the Israeli army - and infamy among the Palestinians - as the young commander of Commando Unit 101, a shady outfit specialising in ruthless hit-and-run raids against suspected Palestinian guerrilla bases.</p> <p>He served at ever-higher ranks in the 1956 Sinai war against Egypt, and in the six-day war of 1967. He resigned from the army in 1972 to begin an extraordinary political career, in which he has sought advancement in parties of the right, left and centre.</p> <p>But on the main Israeli political issue, national security, Sharon has always been on the extreme right. In the late 1970s, when he at last gained ministerial office, he campaigned noisily for the occupied West Bank to be colonised by Jewish settlers, and promoted the strange concept, warmly embraced by the right that \"Jordan is Palestine\".

      "bodyText": "The invitation to Ariel Sharon to join a new coalition government is a reflection of grimmest reality: Israel is on the brink of war, and in wartime the country always has a government of national unity. Sharon, 72, has no shortage of admirers on the Israeli right, who see him as a hero, and no shortage of detractors, who see him as a dangerous rogue. Palestinians generally have no such equivocation. They loathe the man. Arabs insist that it was Sharon's visit to the Haram al-Sharif mosque complex in Jerusalem on September 28 which sparked the latest bloodletting. But their passionate dislike of the Likud leader goes back much, much further. Nearly half a century ago, Sharon was winning a reputation in the Israeli army - and infamy among the Palestinians - as the young commander of Commando Unit 101, a shady outfit specialising in ruthless hit-and-run raids against suspected Palestinian guerrilla bases. He served at ever-higher ranks in the 1956 Sinai war against Egypt, and in the six-day war of 1967. He resigned from the army in 1972 to begin an extraordinary political career, in which he has sought advancement in parties of the right, left and centre. But on the main Israeli political issue, national security, Sharon has always been on the extreme right. In the late 1970s, when he at last gained ministerial office, he campaigned noisily for the occupied West Bank to be colonised by Jewish settlers, and promoted the strange concept, warmly embraced by the right that \"Jordan is Palestine\". We call it ethnic cleansing now. In 1981 Sharon got the job he always wanted: minister of defence. He supervised the preparations for the following year's Operation Peace for Galilee, the invasion of south Lebanon which was supposed to protect Israel's northern border. It was the start of a brutal little war, and an 18-year occupation. But the single act of brutality, still seared into the collective Arab memory, was the massacre of Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps in Beirut, by the Christian Phalangist militia. The militia, seeking revenge for the assassination of their leader, president-elect Bashir Gemayel, were allowed into the camps by Israeli army units, ostensibly on the pretext that they were looking for armed guerrillas. Instead, they fired indiscriminately, killing hundreds. The Israeli left was outraged by the crime, which was apparently committed with their army's complicity. Sharon was only mildly criticised by the official inquiry, but was forced to resign. In and out of office, Sharon has built a formidable following among those Israelis who believe their country has to use all means to defend itself against the surrounding hordes. His inclusion in government might protect the prime minister, Ehud Barak, from the tide of rightist criticism which threatens to engulf him. But it will also bring new dangers to the crumbling peace process. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine any Arab leader who would be prepared to negotiate, let alone do a deal, with an administration including Sharon.

      "body": "<p>Terence Davies has characterised The House of Mirth by Edith Wharton as Jane Austen with the gloves off. That isn't quite true - Jane Austen is Jane Austen with the gloves off - but Davies has brought an unexpected intensity, a genuine passion, to his adaptation of Wharton's novel of love, cruelty and guile in America's high society of the early 20th century. </p> <p>The story of Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson), the beautiful society princess who miscalculates in her search for an advantageous match, becomes a Rake's Progress of social shame. </p> <p>The heroine heads into the unthinkable abyss of poverty with each calamitous romantic manoeuvre among the drawing-room Machiavels and country-house Clausewitzes - and Davies compels you to watch, horrified and fascinated, as Lily arrives at her self-willed, tragic fate. </p> <p>This outstanding film shows how masterly is Davies's visual sense and what a light, adroit touch he has turned out to have with \"period\" furniture and detail. It is a revelation to see how he has transformed the novelistic conventions of place and character with such tact, and the kind of sobriety and discretion that allows the cast to give vivid, attractive performances. What a refreshing experience that is after the mess Martin Scorsese managed to make of Wharton's The Age of Innocence, obtusely fetishising the mahogany and bone china and unconvincingly affecting to find eroticism in Daniel Day-Lewis pantingly unbuttoning Michelle Pfeiffer's glove. Davies's film wears its history lightly. </p> <p>In particular, Gillian Anderson is a revelation. Many was the jeer and jest that this casting had provoked here and there, I am sorry to say, with some wondering aloud if David Duchovny is to be cast in future as the lead in a biopic of Lord David Cecil. </p> <p>But Anderson is excellent. Her jolie-laide face is capable of conveying an acutely calibrated, technically accomplished range including mischief, erotic rapture, despair, self-loathing. Sometimes she is sleek and pert, sometimes ill and puffy and bathed with cold sweat. Davies and his cinematographer, Remi Adefarasin, often have her face right in front of shot for what seems like minutes at a time and it is a challenge that she meets triumphantly as a screen actor. This is the kind of role that might have gone to Glenn Close 10 or 20 years ago, but I wonder if Close would have carried it off with this much style. In particular: her appearance in a tableau - Summer by Watteau - is despatched with aplomb. This is an Oscar-credible performance. </p> <p>The same, or almost the same, goes for Lily's suitors, Dan Aykroyd and Anthony LaPaglia: respectively, Gus Treynor, the married man whose attentions are the beginning of Lily's downfall, and Sim Rosedale, the wealthy bachelor whose offer of marriage Lily first spurns, and then, in dire financial straits, humiliatingly wishes to accept. These are big, rangy, well-fed actors who look their age. But both Aykroyd and LaPaglia have an appropriately leonine presence, conveying genial and cynical exuberance which thrillingly turns ugly when the subject of their own wealth and status is at issue. In some ways their gamey, rackety performances are more successful than the primped and upright Eric Stoltz as Lawrence Selden, Lily's one true friend. </p> <p>Money is always the raw and unavoidable fact of this movie: money promised, money withheld, money deployed and money displayed. And although it is not precisely true that Wharton is more frank than Henry James on the question of money - it will be interesting to compare The House of Mirth with the forthcoming Merchant Ivory account of The Golden Bowl - she and Davies are certainly more candid about the catastrophic effects of its sudden removal. </p> <p>The gravitational pull of poverty and social shame is what guides this movie's narrative, skilfully formed by Davies, particularly in the pleasing transposition from the chill of the American eastern seaboard to the sunlit fleshpots of the Mediterranean where Lily's treacherous circle of friends have arrived in a yacht. There, Lily is to be seen lounging on deck with the brilliant blue water rippling behind her, evidently shot on a sound stage with a back-projection. A pleasingly Hitchcockian moment of camp. </p> <p>How extraordinary that this is Terence Davies's first film in six years, and only his fifth in a career of 25 years. His signature visual touches are all there: the languorous, unhurried takes on the still-life interiors. But this has been opened out into a substantial, well-upholstered picture with more sinew and power than almost any other period drama of recent times. It gripped me like a thriller throughout: a brilliant new film from a great British director.</p>",

But don't forget: they've rode their luck at home on a couple of occasions, and that's against so-called lesser opposition like Charlton and Shakhtar as well.</p> <p>This is also the first season Arsene Wenger's men look like making a serious fist of their European Cup campaign, and with an important trip to Lazio coming up only three days later, you could forgive them for easing up in the Premiership.</p> <p>Villa, meanwhile, are on no mean roll themselves - so surely fives is too good a price to turn down.</p> <p><strong>Sean Ingle</strong></p> <p>\u00a32 Trixie (three doubles and one accumulator = \u00a38 in total) on Sunderland v Chelsea: number of goals 0 or 1 @ 13/5; Leicester v Manchester United; number of goals 0 or 1 @ 14/5; Southampton to beat Everton @ 3/1 </p> <p>After Deng Xiaoping replaced Mao Zedong as supreme Chinese leader he instituted a policy called 'Socialism with Chinese characteristics', transforming China from a backward, beat-up country into the economic powerhouse we see today. Like Deng, I am hoping that by tweaking the master's formula - in my case Blue Square's Patrick Murray - my bank balance, like China's GNP, will soar.</p> <p>Perhaps that explains why I am trying to take Mr Murray's traditional approach (search for value) and blend it in with my own (pick three or four value bets and perm them).

And they've won every game played so far this season at Highbury. But don't forget: they've rode their luck at home on a couple of occasions, and that's against so-called lesser opposition like Charlton and Shakhtar as well. This is also the first season Arsene Wenger's men look like making a serious fist of their European Cup campaign, and with an important trip to Lazio coming up only three days later, you could forgive them for easing up in the Premiership. Villa, meanwhile, are on no mean roll themselves - so surely fives is too good a price to turn down. Sean Ingle \u00a32 Trixie (three doubles and one accumulator = \u00a38 in total) on Sunderland v Chelsea: number of goals 0 or 1 @ 13/5; Leicester v Manchester United; number of goals 0 or 1 @ 14/5; Southampton to beat Everton @ 3/1 After Deng Xiaoping replaced Mao Zedong as supreme Chinese leader he instituted a policy called 'Socialism with Chinese characteristics', transforming China from a backward, beat-up country into the economic powerhouse we see today. Like Deng, I am hoping that by tweaking the master's formula - in my case Blue Square's Patrick Murray - my bank balance, like China's GNP, will soar. Perhaps that explains why I am trying to take Mr Murray's traditional approach (search for value) and blend it in with my own (pick three or four value bets and perm them). I know I'll win less often, but if two out of the three bets I've suggested for this weekend come off I will win about \u00a320. Southampton are decent value at 3/1 to beat an Everton side that lost 3-0 to Ipswich during their last home game and have Niklas Alexandersson, Duncan Ferguson, Alessandro Pistone, Richard Gough, Francis Jeffers and Abel Xavier out. Leicester have a great defensive record, while a Manchester United side without Beckham - and with one eye on Wednesday's Champions League game against PSV - might not come to Filbert Street with all guns blazing. Therefore 0-0 or 1-0 suggests itself.

      "bodyText": "European Union leaders flew into Biarritz last night to get down to the nitty-gritty of trying to reform their club before new members join in the coming years. Two days in the fashionable French Pyrenees coastal resort of Biarritz will do much to determine the future shape of a body whose institutions will seize up unless they change. Despite distractions over the Middle East crisis and the future of Yugoslavia, Tony Blair and his fellow summiteers are expected finally to put their cards on the table - appropriately enough, in the city's belle \u00e9poque casino. What happens here will have a big impact on the Treaty of Nice, the document due to crown France's term holding the EU presidency in early December, just seven weeks away. \"If you're looking at the new treaty, Biarritz is the meeting that tells what the market can and can't bear,\" said one key official. Tough issues are on the agenda, including the extent to which majority voting prevails in EU decisions, the relative weight of the 15 member states, the size of the European Commission and the possibility of formalising a \"two-speed Europe\" in which states that want faster integration go ahead themselves on that basis. Leaders are also likely to adopt the draft EU charter of fundamental rights. No formal decisions will be taken, but by tomorrow night, the endgame that will lead to the EU's most important treaty since Maastricht launched the euro in 1992 will have begun. The summit opens, however, with many gaps unbridged, despite months of talks. Reform is urgently needed to prevent the decision-making structures - created in 1957 for the six original members of what was the European Economic Community - breaking down when the EU expands to 25 or more. Poland and Hungary are leading the field for entry by the middle of the decade, but Romania, Bulgaria, Malta and Lithuania are all queueing up too. France's president, Jacques Chirac, set the pace last summer when he called for a \"pioneer group\" of integrationist-minded countries that could forge ahead without being held back by laggards. Britain's nightmare is that this could mean a formal role for the 12 members of euroland, marginalising EU finance ministers and paving the way for economic integration that would leave Britain in the slow lane. Denmark's rejection of the single currency last month, and the knock-on effects in Sweden and Britain, mean that this is now a long-term problem. Speaking in Warsaw last week, Tony Blair signalled that he was prepared to countenance two speeds, but not two tiers, implying concessions on the final treaty terms. British officials say Mr Blair will resist pressure to surrender the national veto in key areas such as taxation and defence. He can count on the support of like-minded countries, including Sweden, Ireland and Luxembourg. Contrary to claims by eurosceptics, Britain does not stand alone on any single EU issue of importance. The EU's big four - Germany, France, Italy, Britain - are united over two sets of crucially linked issues. All are prepared to sacrifice one of their two commissioners in Brussels in exchange for a reweighting of votes in the council of ministers, where EU governments cooperate. In recent years the big guys have lost out to the little players - so there is now a real problem of democratic legitimacy with the 400,000 people of Luxembourg having two votes as against 10 for 85m Germans. Germany seems to have accepted that the parity among the big four should not change, but Spain is pressing hard for recognition as a medium-sized member. The tradeoffs and alliances of the coming weeks will be decided in Biarritz. Smaller countries have been irritated by attempts by the bigger ones to set a limit of 20 commissioners, an issue that seems likely to be settled by staying with one per country and creating deputy commissioners. Mr Blair is ahead of the curve in calling for increased cooperation among member states - the main theme of his Warsaw speech - while paying lip service to the importance of the commission as the guardian of the treaties and the vast single market. Romano Prodi, the commission's beleaguered president, is in danger of looking even more marginal than usual.",

That number is 270, the total of electoral college votes that either Al Gore or George W Bush must amass in order to capture the White House on November 7.</p> <p>At a time when all who are involved in this tight presidential election campaign are obsessed with national polls showing one or the other man ahead - often by tiny margins - it is worthwhile to remember that the presidency is decided not by the popular vote but by the electoral college. In theory - and even, on three past occasions, in practice - the winner in the popular vote does not necessarily become president.</p> <p>This hasn't happened for more than a century, but it is not an impossibility this November. Indeed this is precisely what the latest state-based polls are indicating. Bush may have a narrow lead in the national match-ups - this week's Pew poll put him ahead by the narrowest of margins, 45% to 44%, for example - but the accumulated picture from the states is different. Out there, it is Gore, not Bush, who is in the lead. And on election day, it's the states that each candidate wins that will determine the outcome.</p> <p>A brief reminder of how the electoral college works. Each state has votes equal to its members in the US House of Representatives and in the US Senate combined. Since a state's representation in the House is based on its population, while each state has two senators, populous California has the most electoral college votes with 54, while seven small states and the District of Columbia each have just three. There are 538 members of the electoral college, and therefore 270 electoral college votes are required to win the presidency.</p> <p>It has to be admitted that, at this stage, the composite picture from the states can only be put together by local polls taken on different dates and of differing levels of reliability. Nevertheless, the latest calculations suggest that Gore currently has 281 electoral college votes leaning his way, while Bush has only 249. One state, the normally Republican Arizona, is too close to call, but even if Arizona is added to the Bush total, it isn't enough to overtake Gore at present.</p> <p>Gore's states currently consist of California, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, Hew Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.</p> <p>Bush's current list comprises the rest: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona (perhaps), Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.</p> <p>The electoral map after November 7 will inevitably look different to the map as it appears today. Nevertheless, a few features stand out. Gore's strength is concentrated wholly in the four westernmost states, the mid-west and the north-east. Bush controls almost everything else to the west of the Missouri river, plus the South and a significant salient in the mid-west. Bush country covers more acres than Gore country, which is concentrated in the most densely populated states.</p> <p>If Gore wins on this basis in November, he will be the first presidential candidate not to carry his own state since George McGovern in 1972. But the similarity ends there for, whereas McGovern was obliterated, Gore would win the White House. The really striking thing about this match-up is that it would make Gore the first Democratic president in history to be elected without the support of a single Southern state.</p> <p>Talking to a Gore aide the other day, we compared notes on the battle for the individual states. His list for a narrow Gore win was rather different from the line-ups just discussed. It didn't include Oregon, Nevada, Iowa, Missouri or Maine. It did, however, include Tennessee and West Virginia. Even that list gives a pretty amazing picture of Gore's America. The only Southern state in the Democratic camp was Tennessee. It foresaw Republican victories in Missouri and Florida, two states where Gore has strong hopes of winning.</p> <p>But the most significant thing was the underlying and unspoken assumption. A Gore aide predicts his man will win by 274 to 264, losing some of the most important battleground states of the election. If that doesn't tell you that November 7 will be one of the closest elections in American history, then nothing will.</p>",

Since a state's representation in the House is based on its population, while each state has two senators, populous California has the most electoral college votes with 54, while seven small states and the District of Columbia each have just three. There are 538 members of the electoral college, and therefore 270 electoral college votes are required to win the presidency. It has to be admitted that, at this stage, the composite picture from the states can only be put together by local polls taken on different dates and of differing levels of reliability. Nevertheless, the latest calculations suggest that Gore currently has 281 electoral college votes leaning his way, while Bush has only 249. One state, the normally Republican Arizona, is too close to call, but even if Arizona is added to the Bush total, it isn't enough to overtake Gore at present. Gore's states currently consist of California, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, Hew Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. Bush's current list comprises the rest: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona (perhaps), Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming. The electoral map after November 7 will inevitably look different to the map as it appears today. Nevertheless, a few features stand out. Gore's strength is concentrated wholly in the four westernmost states, the mid-west and the north-east. Bush controls almost everything else to the west of the Missouri river, plus the South and a significant salient in the mid-west. Bush country covers more acres than Gore country, which is concentrated in the most densely populated states. If Gore wins on this basis in November, he will be the first presidential candidate not to carry his own state since George McGovern in 1972. But the similarity ends there for, whereas McGovern was obliterated, Gore would win the White House. The really striking thing about this match-up is that it would make Gore the first Democratic president in history to be elected without the support of a single Southern state. Talking to a Gore aide the other day, we compared notes on the battle for the individual states. His list for a narrow Gore win was rather different from the line-ups just discussed. It didn't include Oregon, Nevada, Iowa, Missouri or Maine. It did, however, include Tennessee and West Virginia. Even that list gives a pretty amazing picture of Gore's America. The only Southern state in the Democratic camp was Tennessee. It foresaw Republican victories in Missouri and Florida, two states where Gore has strong hopes of winning. But the most significant thing was the underlying and unspoken assumption. A Gore aide predicts his man will win by 274 to 264, losing some of the most important battleground states of the election. If that doesn't tell you that November 7 will be one of the closest elections in American history, then nothing will.",

His name was Auguste Escoffier. Escoffier transformed the place of the chef in the restaurant hierarchy, the working conditions for all kitchen staff, formalised the way in which kitchens worked, established the kitchen hierarchy and the place of the chef within it, and laid down the basis for much of what passes for modern cooking. </p> <p>There is scarcely a chef worth his salt who hasn't turned to Escoffier's La Guide Culinaire in their hour of need (and there are a great many chefs whose salt would be greatly improved if they did). Escoffier's groundwork prepared the way for the celebrity chef of today, and there is no chef in the UK who has greater celebrity than Marco Pierre White. (There is a distinction between being a celebrity and merely being famous, like Jamie Oliver or Gary Rhodes.) However, celebrity does not necessarily equate to importance or influence. </p> <p>If you study the menus in any of the restaurants in which Marco Pierre White has an interest, you will find a homage to classical French cooking. It may be titivated, reworked, reorganised, relabelled, but the origins are unmistakable. It is the French food that earlier generations fell in love with, told us about, and which we came to expect when we first went to France. This is one aspect of Marco's talent - he has an instinctive understanding of the kind of food many people like to eat and of the environment in which they like to eat it. </p> <p>That is why Granada, with whom he has a close business involvement, have asked him to bring his skills to bear on what has hitherto been one of the most distinctive, and direst, of British eating experiences, the food in old Trust House hotels. </p> <p>But you don't look to a Marco menu for the influences of Italian, Indian, Japanese, Chinese or fusion cooking. His food is rooted firmly in the past. Even when he was at the height of his cooking powers, when he made Harvey's in Wandsworth a place of pilgrimage, his food was French in all essentials. In spite of the much publicised fact that he has never been to France, he showed an uncanny awareness of the latest dishes and developments in the great kitchens there. </p> <p>This is not to diminish his brilliance. He has won his Michelin stars. He was, at the time, the youngest chef ever to be awarded three of them. He was probably the greatest kitchen technician this country has ever seen. He understood how to create great sauces, cook meat or fish precisely, to assemble dishes so that each part of them was perfect, like an engineer understands stress or a chemist the reaction between various chemicals. He can impart this knowledge to the large number of chefs he now has working for him, and this is why his restaurants, by and large, turn out food to an astonishing level of consistency and excellence. But does that make him the chef of the decade? Has he really changed the way in which we eat or think about food? Has he done more for us than other contenders such as Pierre Koffman, Raymond Blanc or even Nico Ladenis? </p> <p>Pierre Koffman is the hero of most chefs in the industry. He published two remarkable books, Memories of Gascony and La Tante Claire, and these have been his sole contributions to the media factory. In the celebrity stakes, Pierre Koffman hasn't even made it to the starting line. Not for Koffman, Ready, Steady, Cook, chatshow appearances or gossip columns. </p> <p>Koffman keeps to his kitchen. Mr Koffman cooks. As a professional and as a creative chef, Koffman is an exemplar, but his very reticence probably disqualifies him from the accolade. </p> <p>Nico Ladenis was, until his retirement from the kitchen last year, the most individual figure, as famous for his abuse of customers and the media as he was for the exquisite passion of his cooking. But his stance, at the height of his powers, was unashamedly elitist. He never became part of the culinary establishment. He eschewed the pulpit that TV or the press might have offered him, and so he had less impact he might otherwise have had. </p> <p>Raymond Blanc is another matter. No one can accuse Raymond Blanc of being a shrinking violet. Books have poured from him. He has charmed from the pulpit of TV. He demonstrates, instructs, talks, broadcasts and, of course, cooks. His is a naturally restless nature, and a curious one, too. He has had a Japanese period. He has dabbled in Indian spicing. He has sought to harness techniques from other culinary cultures and explore technology. He has been a fervent spokesman on behalf of organic food, and has practised what he preached in the gardens of Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons. He has reinvented his cooking at regular intervals, not always to good effect it has to be said, but he always returns to his French roots. M\u00e8re Blanc is never far away from her son's culinary invention. This inventive energy has been as marked during the last 10 years as it was during his first 10. </p> <p>Perhaps most importantly he has been a great missionary for good food outside his own restaurant. The Le Petit Blanc chain of brasserie-effect eateries, which he is rolling out across the country with the backing of the Virgin Group, is making a contribution to the quality of eating out at the democratic end of the market. </p> <p>And, of course, he has also been a phenomenal teacher of chefs. Paul Heathcote, Richard Neat, Bruno Loubet, Aaron Paterson, Michael Caines, John Burton-Race, Michael Wormersly, not to mention MPW himself, have all passed through his kitchens. All these chefs have gone on to run Michelin-starred kitchens of their own. </p> <p>However, there is little generic similarity between their cooking styles. Raymond Blanc seems to have the gift of inspiring and instilling principles in his chefs without forcing them to conform to a Blancian template. In this he differs greatly from Marco. It isn't that the chefs who have passed through Marco's kitchens lack creativity, but the style of food they go on to produce is very much in the master's image. None the worse for that, you may say, given the excellence of the master. True, but it doesn't take cooking in this country any further forward. It immures it in history. It takes its principles from an outmoded past. It's as if painting or architecture still subscribed to the taste of classical Greece or Rome. </p> <p>Marco bestrode the London restaurant scene like a colossus in the 90s. He embodied the zeitgeist of the capital's gastronomic aspirations. Nothing he said or did was ever less than interesting. He was the source of immense excitement. He cooked and he made money, and he knew when to stop. </p> <p>The notion of a chef of the decade is, frankly, risible, but if you had to choose one it would be as well to remember that London doesn't represent the rest of Britain, and French cooking is not the future or even the present of food in this country.</p>",

He eschewed the pulpit that TV or the press might have offered him, and so he had less impact he might otherwise have had. Raymond Blanc is another matter. No one can accuse Raymond Blanc of being a shrinking violet. Books have poured from him. He has charmed from the pulpit of TV. He demonstrates, instructs, talks, broadcasts and, of course, cooks. His is a naturally restless nature, and a curious one, too. He has had a Japanese period. He has dabbled in Indian spicing. He has sought to harness techniques from other culinary cultures and explore technology. He has been a fervent spokesman on behalf of organic food, and has practised what he preached in the gardens of Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons. He has reinvented his cooking at regular intervals, not always to good effect it has to be said, but he always returns to his French roots. M\u00e8re Blanc is never far away from her son's culinary invention. This inventive energy has been as marked during the last 10 years as it was during his first 10. Perhaps most importantly he has been a great missionary for good food outside his own restaurant. The Le Petit Blanc chain of brasserie-effect eateries, which he is rolling out across the country with the backing of the Virgin Group, is making a contribution to the quality of eating out at the democratic end of the market. And, of course, he has also been a phenomenal teacher of chefs. Paul Heathcote, Richard Neat, Bruno Loubet, Aaron Paterson, Michael Caines, John Burton-Race, Michael Wormersly, not to mention MPW himself, have all passed through his kitchens. All these chefs have gone on to run Michelin-starred kitchens of their own. However, there is little generic similarity between their cooking styles. Raymond Blanc seems to have the gift of inspiring and instilling principles in his chefs without forcing them to conform to a Blancian template. In this he differs greatly from Marco. It isn't that the chefs who have passed through Marco's kitchens lack creativity, but the style of food they go on to produce is very much in the master's image. None the worse for that, you may say, given the excellence of the master. True, but it doesn't take cooking in this country any further forward. It immures it in history. It takes its principles from an outmoded past. It's as if painting or architecture still subscribed to the taste of classical Greece or Rome. Marco bestrode the London restaurant scene like a colossus in the 90s. He embodied the zeitgeist of the capital's gastronomic aspirations. Nothing he said or did was ever less than interesting. He was the source of immense excitement. He cooked and he made money, and he knew when to stop. The notion of a chef of the decade is, frankly, risible, but if you had to choose one it would be as well to remember that London doesn't represent the rest of Britain, and French cooking is not the future or even the present of food in this country.",

Rivers swollen by a night of unceasing rain burst their banks, sending torrents of water rushing through town centres in Sussex, Kent and Hampshire. More than 150 flood alerts were issued across the country yesterday as meteorologists predicted more rain to come. Uckfield in East Sussex was worst hit after five inches of rain in 12 hours left the town almost completely submerged. Lifeboat crews were drafted in to rescue stranded residents and workers and one man was swept away by the fast-flowing floods as he tried to open his shop. He was spotted 20 minutes later clinging on to the banks of the river Uck. He was airlifted to safety by a coastguard helicopter which was scrambled from Eastbourne, 18 miles away. A teenage looter was caught by a quick-thinking police officer who borrowed a JCB to chase and arrest the youth as he waded through the flooded high street with a trolleyfull of stolen goods. In Lewes, six lifeboat crew narrowly escaped with their lives when their rescue boat was dragged underneath a bridge that had been almost submerged by the water. Residents were last night evacuated from the town as the waters rose and the Ouse threatened to burst its banks. The environment agency described the situation across the south as \"dire\", warning that conditions were likely to get worse before they got better as the Met Office warned that there would be more rain in south-east England. By last night the agency had issued 40 flood warnings, advising that flooding was expected to spread to other areas of the country, including Devon, Yorkshire and Shropshire. Severe flood warnings, alerting people to an imminent threat to life and property, were issued for 16 rivers in Sussex and Kent. Sussex police urged drivers to stay at home as main roads were flooded.",

      "bodyText": "TiVo is expected to announce today a deal with the Omnicom Group in New York making it the first member of what is known as the TiVo strategic advertising agency partnership programme. The agreement will give Omnicom agencies the ability to test different methods of advertising that take advantage of the TiVo time-shifting technology and offer Omnicom clients potential discounts if they work with TiVo. Omnicom agencies include BBDO Worldwide, DDB Worldwide and TBWA. Another shop owned by Omnicom, Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco, has been the TiVo consumer agency since February. The development of advertising that differs from traditional commercials stems from a crucial feature of the systems sold by TiVo which enables viewers to pause, replay, rewind and fast-forward through television programmes and commercials as they are watched. In an interview with the New York Times today, Stacy Jolna, chief programming officer and vice-president for advertising and media partnerships at TiVo in California, said: \"Clearly, advertising will change in a dramatic way. Viewers have never been more central in half a century of watching TV. \"The point of this is for agencies to work with us, to experiment with and get a better understanding of the new advertising and marketing techniques we will develop.\"",

During a coffee break one of them mentioned, quite casually, that he had been imprisoned three times. It left me feeling that there was probably no way I could show him enough respect. And wondering whether, in his position, I might not be tempted to give up journalism and open a grocery store instead. * Imagined Masculinities: Male Identity and Culture in the Modern Middle East.

      "body": "<p> 'In a communist country,\" Andrzej Wajda once said, \"a young person has three choices: if he was lucky, he could leave. If he was cunning, he could enter politics. Barring these, he could become a priest or a movie director.\" Luckily for the cinematic world in general, and for Poland in particular, Wajda opted for film.</p> <p> At this year's Oscar ceremony, the 75-year-old director, often regarded as the father of modern Polish film, finally got the recognition he deserved for a magnificent career spanning more than four decades and more than 40 films, receiving a special Oscar for lifetime achievement. The award came just a few months after the release of his most recent film, Pan Tadeusz, an elegant 19th century costume drama which has stunned critics and Polish cinema-goers alike. At the latest count, around 10m Poles - including the Pope, who sent Wajda his congratulations - had been to see Pan Tadeusz, a staggering 25% of Poland's population.</p> <p> Wajda's film is a daring attempt to adapt the most venerated poem in the Polish literary canon. Adam Mickiewcz's Pan Tadeusz is a national epic written in Paris in the mid-19th century, at a time when Poland had been wiped off the political map. Even now it brings tears to the eyes of any Pole asked to recite a stanza from it (a sample: \"My homeland /You are like health /Your value is only recognised by he who loses you\"). In many ways, Pan Tadeusz is the perfect storyboard for a film, including threads of crime, passion, betrayal, jealousy and war. Its narrative is a complicated mesh of interwoven tales, but the basic plot tells a touching love story involving a young couple (Tadeusz, played in the film by the Brad Pitt of Poland, Michal Zebrowski) and Zosia (Alicja Bachleda-Curus) from two opposing families, set against the rising hopes that Napoleon will invade Russia and thus give back to Poland the independence it lost years earlier.</p> <p> The poem contains huge digressions during which Mickiewicz waxes lyrical about the countryside, flying ants and mushroom-picking (a national passion to this day). But thankfully Wajda chose to condense his version to two and a half hours by focusing on the individual characters and their quarrels. Differences are more or less put aside when the compatriots realise they must pull together in order to help Napoleon achieve success. On one level it is as if Wajda has simply given Polish history the Merchant Ivory treatment and is presenting nothing more than slushy patriotism. But there's also a strong underlying darkness to it, as Wajda reinforces Mickiewcz's ridicule of the Poles for their fiery patriotism which obscures the long-term vision necessary for them to save their country.</p> <p> Independence, as history records, was short-lived. \"It's a great story that focuses on our national characteristics,\" Wajda maintains. \"The Poles in Pan Tadeusz are the same as we are now: sometimes wise, sometimes stupid. It's basically a picture of how we are now and allows us to look at ourselves and see who we are and where we're going.\" These are pertinent points for a country which just over a decade ago received back its independence having tossed off the communist yoke, and now faces the uphill battle to assert itself in the new world order (including pushing for entry into the European Union), while at the same time trying not to lose sight of a sense of national identity. \"It's a very good time to make it,\" says journalist Gregorz Mazurowski. \"This is a time of transition for Poland, many \u00e9migr\u00e9s are returning, and we have to remember who we are. Pan Tadeusz, you could say, is a little bit like Braveheart for the Scots.\"</p> <p> Although likely to set the standards for historical dramas to come, Pan Tadeusz is not the first Polish film to appeal to a sense of national pride. It follows close on the heels of Jerzy Hoffmann's adaptation of Henryk Sienkiewicz's epic Ogniem i Mieczem (With Fire and Sword) which is also on the essential reading list. An estimated 7m Poles - twice as many as saw Titanic - have been to see Poland's answer to Gone with the Wind, and fallen in love with its computer-generated castles. Hoffmann describes the importance of home-grown movies, particularly for a nation that has spent so much of its history in a state of suppression. \"No nation can afford to lose sight of its culture and its identity,\" he says. \"Poles are longing to see their own national film made to the standards of the west.\" </p> <p>At the entrance to Lodz film school - two hours south of Poland and still considered to be one of Europe's best - a plaque used to hang on the entrance, on which was inscribed Lenin's dictum: \"Of all the arts, film is the most important to us.\" But here, in Lodz, Wajda is a Pole apart. Despite the critics' praise for Pan Tadeusz, the school's professors - contemporaries of Wajda, Polanski and Kieslowski - are sniffy about Wajda's efforts to put Polish history on the silver screen. \"Frankly this commercialisation of films is not very Polish,\" says Professor Piotr Wojciechowski. \"Okay, so Pan Tadeusz had to be made into a film, because it represents a stream of national consciousness, but it's not art - it's as if Wajda is repeating what he learnt in his Hollywood lectures.\" He adds that this unfortunate tendency will be over in \"two to four years\". Student Eugeniusz Hanemann, 30, agrees: \"I think Mr Wajda made a mistake. But then again I'm biased - we don't like him because he tried to move the school to Warsaw.\"</p> <p> The fact remains that few film-makers have remained as consistently committed to depicting their own nation's history and culture as Wajda. His personal history no doubt has a lot to do with it. During the second world war, he joined the resistance as a 16-year-old, after his father, a Polish army officer, was shot in the back of the head, along with some 90% of Poland's officer corps, at Katyn, Ukraine, on Stalin's orders. The communists blamed the massacre on the Nazis and many believed the lie for decades. Just two years after graduating, Wajda directed A Generation, his first professional film, but the one that was to herald the arrival of a new era of film-making in Poland and for which he'll be most remembered. Polanski, who worked with him on the film, says: \"The whole of Polish cinema can trace its roots to it.\" With A Generation, Kanal (which won the jury prize at the Cannes film festival in 1957), and Ashes and Diamonds, which clinched the jury prize at Venice in 1958, Wajda put Polish cinema on the map with a trilogy of films about young Poles who are born in the shadow of fascism and fall victim to their nation's call for sacrifice.</p> <p> Wajda spent much of his subsequent career battling censors, and in 1981 he was forced to move to France, only returning once Solidarity was legalised in 1989. His film legacy, including the Oscar-nominated Promised Land, set in Lodz, the anti-propagandist Man of Marble, and Man of Iron (about the rise of Solidarity, in which Lech Walesa plays himself), indicate that most Poles had lives equally as painful as Wajda's own and that, nevertheless, the nation managed to retain its identity. To his credit, even since the fall of communism, although many have said his talent is ebbing, Wajda has continued to make Poles think. Now that totalitarianism is over, he insists, his compatriots need to be provoked, not consoled. Pan Tadeusz, he admits, was the most difficult project of his career. But the hardest might be to come.</p> <p> He is currently working on what he says will be his directorial swansong: a recreation of one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century, the Katyn massacre, in which his father died. The alleged perpetrators of the massacre are now battling to clear their names in the Polish courts. Production has not yet begun, but critics are already hailing it as Poland's most cathartic film. </p> <p>\u0095 Pan Tadeusz has its British premiere tonight at the French Institute in London.

      "body": "<p>Champions of the world's largest film format, Imax, are confident that next week's UK release of CyberWorld, a 3D animation extravaganza with stars from Antz and The Simpsons, will further place the medium on a viable commercial footing. Despite this and the opening of three new British Imax cinemas in coming months, the acceptance of Imax into the movie mainstream still has some way to go. </p> <p>Imax has been around since 1970, when the company behind it, Imax Corporation, developed a new, giant-screen feature film format. It uses film 10 times larger than a conventional 35mm frame and three times bigger than standard 70mm. This, combined with unique Imax projection technology, delivers images of unsurpassed size, clarity and, aficionados insist, impact. </p> <p>Accompanied by state-of-the-art multi-speaker sound systems, Imax films are projected onto screens 20 metres high by 26 metres across - the size of five double-decker buses. Due to its particular specifications, however, Imax requires films to be shot and produced in a particular way. </p> <p>You can't just shoot footage on any old format and transfer it into large format - although this might be possible in the future. For now, large-format films must be shot using large-format equipment and with specially designed giant film stock. </p> <p>Resembling a fridge on a tripod and as noisy as a vacuum cleaner, an Imax camera needs re-loading after just a few minutes. Yet despite this, hundreds of films have been shot in Imax since the format's launch. And last year more than 75 million people visited an Imax theatre worldwide. </p> <p>Since the mid-90s, Imax Corporation has invested heavily in international expansion. It's opened hundreds of Imax theatres around the world. And it's developed further innovations with Imax technology such as Imax 3D, and \"stereo animation\" which allows animators to draw and animate freehand in 3D space. </p> <p>Without doubt the main appeal of Imax is, quite literally, the spectacle. An Imax film is larger than life - a true movie-going \"experience\". Which explains the fact that, for many years, the majority of Imax films were factual, made for a specific venue, such as a museum or visitor centre, or for theme park rides. </p> <p>This has changed, however, with growth in the number of commercial Imax cinemas, says Dennis Laws, technical manager at the BFI London Imax cinema. \"Established producers and studios have woken up to the potential of shooting in Imax,\" he says. \"With 280 Imax cinemas now worldwide, it's more appealing - and commercially viable - to make Imax films.\" </p> <p>So, Disney produced Fantasia 2000 for Imax. CyberWorld, a potpourri of computer-animated short films, is backed by DreamWorks, 20th Century Fox and Sony Pictures Imageworks. DreamWorks, meanwhile, recently confirmed plans to release an Imax 3D version of its next animated feature, Shrek, in December 2001. Even the BBC is getting in on the act, currently making an Imax film about the human body. </p> <p>\"As a film-maker, Imax is the pinnacle - it's filming the best you can ever get it, on a 90-foot screen, at 70mm resolution and in stereo,\" says Ian Bird, creative director of London-based Eye Animation Studios which produced the Liberation sequence in CyberWorld. </p> <p>\"Even though it's been around a while, I believe Imax will become the main theatrical experience for film in the future,\" he adds. \"It's more intimate and personal, for some reason. And its potential for stirring narrative is starting to be realised.\" A case in point is recent Imax production Loch Lomond: Legend of the Loch, made by British company Principal Large Format, which was acclaimed at last month's Giant Screen Theatre Association convention in Frankfurt for demonstrating the true narrative potential of Imax. </p> <p>A key issue, however, will be at what point Imax films graduate from their standard 45-minute duration to 90 minutes-plus. A key reason for their shorter length is the format's documentary heritage, Laws says. Another is caution over production costs. The economics of making an Imax movie are very different to conventional film-making. They have a far longer shelf life, for a start - which is just as well given that it can take years for investors to see a return. </p> <p>\"Traditionally, the box office split is less favourable to the film-maker than in conventional film-making,\" explains Lock London producer Phil Streather, director of Principal Large Format. \"For Imax, the box office pays for prints and advertising so the return to the distributor/film-maker is far less - perhaps $15m on $100m gross.\" Typically, just one third of an Imax film's production budget comes from equity funding, with the balance usually comprising scientific grants and sponsorship - AOL, Saab and Yahoo are among companies which have backed the format. </p> <p>The extent to which the growing interest of big studios will affect what remains, in effect, a cottage industry remains to be seen. As does how far commercial interests push Imax into narrative storytelling. Until both issues are resolved, however, it will be difficult, irrespective of hype, to justify claims that Imax has finally gone mainstream. </p> <p>\u0095 CyberWorld is released on Friday October 20</p>",

      "bodyText": "Champions of the world's largest film format, Imax, are confident that next week's UK release of CyberWorld, a 3D animation extravaganza with stars from Antz and The Simpsons, will further place the medium on a viable commercial footing. Despite this and the opening of three new British Imax cinemas in coming months, the acceptance of Imax into the movie mainstream still has some way to go. Imax has been around since 1970, when the company behind it, Imax Corporation, developed a new, giant-screen feature film format. It uses film 10 times larger than a conventional 35mm frame and three times bigger than standard 70mm. This, combined with unique Imax projection technology, delivers images of unsurpassed size, clarity and, aficionados insist, impact. Accompanied by state-of-the-art multi-speaker sound systems, Imax films are projected onto screens 20 metres high by 26 metres across - the size of five double-decker buses. Due to its particular specifications, however, Imax requires films to be shot and produced in a particular way. You can't just shoot footage on any old format and transfer it into large format - although this might be possible in the future. For now, large-format films must be shot using large-format equipment and with specially designed giant film stock. Resembling a fridge on a tripod and as noisy as a vacuum cleaner, an Imax camera needs re-loading after just a few minutes. Yet despite this, hundreds of films have been shot in Imax since the format's launch. And last year more than 75 million people visited an Imax theatre worldwide. Since the mid-90s, Imax Corporation has invested heavily in international expansion. It's opened hundreds of Imax theatres around the world. And it's developed further innovations with Imax technology such as Imax 3D, and \"stereo animation\" which allows animators to draw and animate freehand in 3D space. Without doubt the main appeal of Imax is, quite literally, the spectacle. An Imax film is larger than life - a true movie-going \"experience\". Which explains the fact that, for many years, the majority of Imax films were factual, made for a specific venue, such as a museum or visitor centre, or for theme park rides. This has changed, however, with growth in the number of commercial Imax cinemas, says Dennis Laws, technical manager at the BFI London Imax cinema. \"Established producers and studios have woken up to the potential of shooting in Imax,\" he says. \"With 280 Imax cinemas now worldwide, it's more appealing - and commercially viable - to make Imax films.\" So, Disney produced Fantasia 2000 for Imax. CyberWorld, a potpourri of computer-animated short films, is backed by DreamWorks, 20th Century Fox and Sony Pictures Imageworks. DreamWorks, meanwhile, recently confirmed plans to release an Imax 3D version of its next animated feature, Shrek, in December 2001. Even the BBC is getting in on the act, currently making an Imax film about the human body. \"As a film-maker, Imax is the pinnacle - it's filming the best you can ever get it, on a 90-foot screen, at 70mm resolution and in stereo,\" says Ian Bird, creative director of London-based Eye Animation Studios which produced the Liberation sequence in CyberWorld. \"Even though it's been around a while, I believe Imax will become the main theatrical experience for film in the future,\" he adds. \"It's more intimate and personal, for some reason. And its potential for stirring narrative is starting to be realised.\" A case in point is recent Imax production Loch Lomond: Legend of the Loch, made by British company Principal Large Format, which was acclaimed at last month's Giant Screen Theatre Association convention in Frankfurt for demonstrating the true narrative potential of Imax. A key issue, however, will be at what point Imax films graduate from their standard 45-minute duration to 90 minutes-plus. A key reason for their shorter length is the format's documentary heritage, Laws says. Another is caution over production costs. The economics of making an Imax movie are very different to conventional film-making. They have a far longer shelf life, for a start - which is just as well given that it can take years for investors to see a return. \"Traditionally, the box office split is less favourable to the film-maker than in conventional film-making,\" explains Lock London producer Phil Streather, director of Principal Large Format. \"For Imax, the box office pays for prints and advertising so the return to the distributor/film-maker is far less - perhaps $15m on $100m gross.\" Typically, just one third of an Imax film's production budget comes from equity funding, with the balance usually comprising scientific grants and sponsorship - AOL, Saab and Yahoo are among companies which have backed the format. The extent to which the growing interest of big studios will affect what remains, in effect, a cottage industry remains to be seen. As does how far commercial interests push Imax into narrative storytelling. Until both issues are resolved, however, it will be difficult, irrespective of hype, to justify claims that Imax has finally gone mainstream. \u0095 CyberWorld is released on Friday October 20",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Great directors don't always have great careers. The British film-maker Michael Reeves made only three films, between 1966 and 1968: The She-Beast, The Sorcerers, and Witchfinder General, his masterpiece. A year after making Witch-finder General, he died aged just 24, but left the world with three imaginative, low-budget movies, which - in their own modestly ambitious way - are superb examples of a very British type of cinema. </p> <p>Reeves's love of film started young. At the age of eight, he announced to his mother that he wanted to be a film director; three years later, he made his first film, Carrion, which starred his friend Ian Ogilvy as a psychotic who attacks a girl in a wheelchair. Another regular Reeves collaborator, the writer Tom Baker, worked on the film, too. \"He didn't just want to make films, he wanted to make Hollywood movies,\" Baker recalls now. \"So we had to learn how to track. For this we used his mother's tea trolley with an 8mm Bolex on top.\" </p> <p>Reeves and his mother were the poor relations of a rich family, and inherited money when Reeves was 15. He used the opportunity to take himself off to Hollywood at 17, and meet his hero, the action director Don Siegel. Somehow Reeves discovered where Siegel lived, and turned up on his doorstep, where the bewildered director appeared in a string vest and underpants. \"I've come all the way from England to meet you because you are the greatest director that ever lived,\" Reeves told him, and promptly found work in town. </p> <p>A year later he had convinced the producer Paul Maslansky to work with him on his own film, The She-Beast, to be shot in Rome and starring Ogilvy in his first major role. Reeves's goal was to make a scary movie, but cheap sets and corny lines made it obvious that nobody was going to be too scared by this tale of young holidaymakers terrorised by a monstrously deformed witch who comes back from the dead. So they camped it up instead. Made for \u00a315,000, The She-Beast remains notable for making a leading lady of the already legendary horror film icon Barbara Steele, although she was booked for only a single day. \"I managed to get her for $1,000 for one day's work,\" Maslansky recalls, \"but I didn't say how long that day was. I made her work for 18 hours. She didn't speak to me for 20 years.\" </p> <p>Having cut his horror teeth on The She-Beast, Reeves returned to England to make The Sorcerers, a brilliant forerunner of Being John Malkovich in which an old couple, Boris Karloff and Catherine Lacey, invent a machine that allows them to live vicariously through a dissolute young man (Ian Ogilvy, naturally). In an allegory for the vicarious thrills of cinema itself, the old couple's fun starts off innocently enough, with Ogilvy hanging out with groovy chicks and imbibing soft drinks at various swinging nightclubs, but slowly the old woman gets carried away and makes the young hipster carry out a series of increasingly gruesome acts. </p> <p>A moral forewarning of the dangers of a thrill-seeking lifestyle, The Sorcerers depicts an innocent time and makes it seem very sinister indeed, with nightclub scenes inevitably ending in bloodshed and various dolly birds - Susan George among them - coming to a grisly end. </p> <p>The Sorcerers was made quickly, efficiently, and on next to nothing. \"We blew up a Jaguar in Notting Hill without permission,\" Ian Ogilvy remembers. \"The blast shattered windows for blocks around, then we ran like hell. We knew that if we didn't get the right shot within minutes, we'd be in jail for sure.\" Reeves had no problem with endangering the lives of his cast, either. He and Ogilvy filmed a motorbike scene on the M4 at 100mph. Ogilvy wore no helmet, Reeves was in the boot of a car with his camera, and he demanded that his leading man come closer and closer until he was within a metre of him. </p> <p>Then came Witchfinder General. In essence an English western, it is a tale of violent revenge based on the life of Matthew Hopkins, one of Oliver Cromwell's witch-hunters, who is alleged to have ordered the death of 200 people between 1645 and 1646. Hopkins, played with great relish and twisted moral arrogance by Vincent Price, travels through the Suffolk countryside with his thuggish henchman John Stearne and murders the innocent, ostensibly to cleanse the land of evil - but in reality for profit, sexual favours, and the sheer hell of it. When he turns his wicked attentions on an old priest and his daughter, he incurs the wrath of the daughter's husband, a Cromwellian soldier played (naturally) by Ian Ogilvy, who rises up against the witchfinder's dark power. It is a brutal, shockingly violent film, yet beautifully shot, capturing - with panoramic tracking shots - the rolling English landscape under a Turneresque sky. It is an example of something hardly seen today: a uniquely British film that portrays the country's elegance as well as its oppressiveness. </p> <p>As usual, it had limited financial resources. Extra funding came from American International Pictures, and with that came Vincent Price. Used to the comfort of Hollywood, this revered, veteran actor was sent by his studio to the wilds of cold, damp and misty Suffolk, and into the hands of an extremely wilful and very resourceful 23-year-old director. The story goes that a short-tempered Reeves told Price to \"stop over-acting, please, please, please, stop rolling your eyes, and try and look natural for once.\" An offended Price replied: \"Young man, I've been in 84 films. How many have you made?\" \"Two good ones.\" At which Price burst into laughter and did exactly what the young man told him from then on. Price didn't even complain about the uncomfortable job of acting the final sequence, in which Ogilvy beats Hopkins to death with a hammer - rubber, but still rather painful for the ageing actor. </p> <p>The film was shot over five weeks in Suffolk, using a single Arriflex camera, by cinematographer John Coquillon. The few sets used were built locally, and a disused second world war aircraft hangar (rented for \u00a350 a week) was the production base. </p> <p>Lighting came courtesy of Lee Electric, who provided a noisy generator free of charge. According to Coquillon: \"Michael was 25 years ahead of his time, with the eye and the imagination of a veteran. I still wonder whether we ever worried our producers about our way of shooting Witchfinder. We were determined to make it our way and not in the conventional, accepted, boring (to us) ways of those times.\" According to Ogilvy, such conditions helped create great cinema: \"[Reeves's] ability to make do is what makes his films so interesting. How to get over a bad situation.\" </p> <p>Upon release, Witchfinder General was a critical and commercial success, despite cuts by censors concerned by its violence. Reeves was quickly swamped with scripts, but rejected most of them outright, and fell into depression. Always secretly prone to the condition, he began drinking heavily and taking anti-depressants. \"He would shut right down, maybe three to four months before he died,\" Witchfinder's writer, Tom Baker, remembers. After a couple of abandoned projects, Reeves came home one night after a skinful and had insomnia. The coroner's report states that he took a handful of anti-depressants and was found dead in the morning. </p> <p>What Reeves might have gone on to achieve is hinted at by a letter from his old cinematographer Coquillon to the American director Jeff Burr, written in 1983. Coquillon recalls a telephone conversation with Reeves when he was in Los Angeles, shortly before he died. \"One day he called me full of excitement. He'd found the story. We were going to ride around the US, shoot in 16mm and shoot every which way, into the sun and out of the sun - on motorcycles. The actor was to be a long-time LA buddy - a completely unknown son of an actor - name of Peter Fonda. The film was to be called Easy Rider. It was while planning this movie that Michael Reeves died. I still mourn the man and miss him. Always will. One doesn't get to meet many people like him.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Witchfinder General and Blood Beast: The Films of Michael Reeves will be screened at the Cornerhouse, Manchester on October 21 as part of the Britain in Darkness season.

In the mid-60s his first novel, Last Exit to Brooklyn, was the subject of a famous British obscenity trial that fell midway between Lady Chatterley and the Oz \"Schoolkids issue\". Despite the fact that the cream of the British literary aristocracy trooped through the courtroom to defend Selby's merits, the book was first banned, then unbanned on appeal a year later - all this notoriety guaranteeing its publishers a runaway bestseller. </p> <p>There was no such equivalent palaver when Last Exit was filmed in the late 80s - with Jennifer Jason Leigh in the, um, \"difficult\" role of Tralala, a hooker who is multiply, horribly raped outside a bar - and was released without incident. But 35 years later, we seem to have moved no further into the future. The US ratings system seems as ossified as the 60s obscenity laws. Requiem for a Dream, Selby's 1978 junkie novel, has been filmed by Darren Aronofsky, who debuted with Pi a couple of years ago. </p> <p>Requiem has intentionally been released without a ratings certificate in the US, a strategy aimed at avoiding the Motion Picture Association of America's NC-17 rating. The NC-17 appellation was developed as an alternative to the old X rating - which was indelibly associated with hardcore porn - to distinguish non-pornographic adult movies from mere masturbation fodder. Most non-metropolitan American newspapers refused to carry advertising for X ratings and, far from drawing distinctions between X and NC-17, they have merely assumed that one means exactly the same as the other. In short, the NC-17 rating is now rightly seen as a stigma that kills movies at the box office. </p> <p>The distributors, Artisan Entertainment, claim they've been the victim of the recent clashes between Washington politicians and Hollywood studio heads over sex and violence in movies. Exhibitors at two cinema chains in New York have demanded that Artisan's ads and posters specify that no one under the age of 17 will be admitted - even though underage moviegoers aren't usually barred from unrated films. \"We agree with the request being made of us,\" says Artisan chief Amir Malin, \"but we are very concerned about the precedent this sets.\" </p> <p>\"I think this decision by our exhibitors is a dark harbinger of a cold climate of censorship that's blanketing this nation,\" added Requiem's producer Eric Watt this week. \"The really disturbing aspect of this decision is that morally bankrupt studio films will continue to be released unscathed due to their financial and political muscle, while independent films dealing with powerful themes are going to be scapegoated.\" </p> <p>The MPAA has officially rated Requiem as NC-17 - but Artisan in effect repudiated the verdict by risking an unrated release, partly because the rating was based not on any violent content, but on \"explicit sexual content\", in particular a scene in which a pimp forces a woman to have sex with a hooker before a roomful of men. At a time when even hidebound British movie censors have declared that sex on screen - even hardcore sex - is no great threat to public morals, their American equivalents are still obsessed with drawing metaphorical figleaves over the naughty bits, even as they pass violent studio movies uncut. MPAA head Jack Valenti - who used to defend the Vietnam war as LBJ's press spokesman - is equally anxious to defend the now thoroughly discredited NC-17 rating despite, or perhaps even directly because of, debacles like last year's battle over South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut. Directors Trey Parker and Matt Stone used the ratings process and the resulting movie as a stick with which to beat Valenti's organisation. \"Every time they asked us to cut something,\" said Stone, \"we'd take it out and put in 10 things that were much worse - and they'd pass them without blinking.\" </p> <p>Until the wildly unfair inconsistencies of the MPAA system are ironed out, we will continue to live in an upside-down moral universe in which nipples and pubic hair are deemed more threatening to the public good than machine-gun massacres and skipfuls of severed heads. \"Mommy! That lady's pointing her fully loaded boobs at me! Wah!\" </p> <p> <strong>Pin-up Paula</strong><br></p> <p> You can understand why Pamela Anderson and Dr Laura Schlessinger might object when nudie pictures of themselves turn up on the internet for the titillation of one and all, but one really has to wonder at the willingness of many women stars and celebrities to disrobe for money in the pages of America's skin mags. The parade of stars who seek empowerment by taking control of their own bimbo-isation has been endless and now presidential accuser Paula Corbin Jones plans to appear nude in Penthouse. </p> <p>You have to ask yourself if Jones - whose rhinoplasty operation will soon celebrate its second birthday - has even seen a copy of Penthouse recently. Chances are she thinks it's still a couple of degrees naughtier than Playboy's chaste and airbrushed sexual romper-room aesthetic. Wrong. Penthouse's Bob Guccione has - since the bitter \"Pubic Wars\" of the early 70s - always positioned himself beyond the Playboy pale. Opening a copy of US Penthouse today is like opening a hardcore magazine in 1975: photo layouts feature oral sex, penetration and ejaculations. This is all part of a little-remarked change in the men's sophisticate magazine market spearheaded by Larry Flynt in the early 90s, when he told his employees he wanted \"more penetration!\" (I used to toil for Flynt and this was one of many company meetings I attended with eyes popping, my chin on my chest). Now everyone's doing it - except Playboy. </p> <p>So if Paula is expecting the hazy dreamworld that enfolded Gennifer Flowers when she stripped for Hef, she needs to think again, given the relentlessly gynaecological focus of the Penthouse lens. No doubt we can also expect a retelling of her tawdry dealings with Bubba Clinton (if indeed there were any), and further discussion of the presidential member. The dividing line between \"empowerment\" and voluntary degradation seems to have disappeared completely. </p> <p>Is it only a matter of time before Hillary gets 'em off?</p>",

Saga magazine is about to publish the results of an opinion poll of its readers asking which party's pension policy is best. Saga magazine has more than a million pensioner readers, most of them likely to be natural conservatives since their readership is largely more affluent ABC1s. After the policy of each party was explained carefully, 5,000 Saga readers resoundingly rejected the Tory plan, by 72% against to 28% in favour.</p> <p>This is the Tory plan: William Hague says he will match whatever Labour promises and add an \"extra\" \u00a33.50 too. This \"extra\" comes from taking the \u00a3150 winter fuel payment, the \u00a310 Christmas bonus and the \u00a3104 television licence for over-75s, and spreading it all out over the year instead. There would also be a real 42p a week more, raised by taking money from the social fund for the destitute and axing the new deal for lone parents. Adding in the \u00a32.25 inflation uprating the government will pay out automatically next April, Hague claims a total of \u00a35.75 more.</p> <p>When it was revealed to be only 42p new money, the Tories replied sententiously that it was a question of dignity: the old wanted to save or spend their money themselves and not have it paid in lump sum \"gimmicks\". Tories say that wherever they go pensioners say they want their money paid by the week: Labour says pensioners tell them they like their lump sums. All the same, until today Labour was worrying that pensioners might be fooled by this Tory sleight of hand - giving them back their own money.</p> <p>But in this poll overwhelmingly more pensioners wanted to keep their bonuses. The Tory's 42p is even more of an insult than the government's ill-fated 75p uprating this year. \"Mr Hague will have to think of something better than this,\" said a reader from Reading who is a Conservative party member. \"The fuel allowance and TV licence saves us a lot of worry,\" said a widow from Birmingham.</p> <p>What's more, many had immediately understood the devilish complexity of the apparently simple Tory plan. Currently these lump sums are not taxed, but they would be for better-off pensioners once it was all rolled into the pension. The Tories hastened to say they would make sure tax thresholds were raised so that no one would be worse off.</p> <p>But the number of losers keeps on growing. One and half million men aged 60 to 64 will have their winter fuel payments taken away altogether under the Tory plan. So will a number of women who never paid enough NI contributions to qualify for the full pension. On top of that, the Saga poll unearthed all kinds of new anomalies and anxieties. One man whose pension contributions only qualify him for 69% of the basic pension complains that he would only get 69% of his winter fuel allowance returned to him under the Tories. A Mrs H from Hampshire is in the council tax trap many others would face: \"If my pension was increased by \u00a33.50 a week the council would take back \u00a32.98, leaving me 52p.\" Again as each new problem arises, the Tories hasten to say they'll sort it all out. But many Saga pensioners didn't trust the Tories not to claw it back: \"Better money in the hand from Labour than promises in the bush from the Tories,\" said a pensioner from Chippenham.</p> <p>Most of these 5,000 pensioners polled are unlikely to be natural Labour supporters. Not only are they mostly the more affluent, but Mori's last poll showed how although Labour had pulled ahead by two points among all voters, among pensioners they were still trailing three points behind.

The chancellor is out and about listening this week - to groups of hauliers, farmers, pensioners and single mothers, gauging their mood before his crucial pre-budget statement in three weeks' time.</p> <p>After stormy scenes at the Labour party conference, Gordon Brown rushed to promise \u00a390 for next April's minimum income guarantee (MIG), a great \u00a312 jump for the poorest to the level recommended by Age Concern and the Commons Select Committee. He also let it be known that the basic pension will rise. \"Transitional\" arrangements until 2003's new pension credit provides an excuse for upping the universal pension. It could be as much as \u00a35 more a week for rich and poor alike, plus the automatic inflation uprating of \u00a32.25 - \u00a37.25 for a single pensioner. Will that do the trick?</p> <p>If the chancellor really wants to shoot the Tory fox, this is what he should do. In listening mode, he should ask pensioners which way they want their money paid. After comprehensive polling and consultation he should do whatever they want. If, as in the Saga poll, they really like things as they are, then the Tories are dead in the water. If, on the other hand, they say they do indeed want it paid weekly, then why not? Either way, the Tories are left without a policy.

If you began instead with the idea that, at the very least, ownership was disputed, then the fact, for example, that Yasser Arafat never questioned Israeli control of West Jerusalem was a far bigger concession than any made by Barak.

Yesterday's helicopter strikes underline the disparity. This is not a struggle which the Palestinians can continue for very long, for the costs would be truly terrible, and there is a limit to the political gains, in terms of international sympathy, which the confrontation can bring.

Protecting the settlements without occupation, however, as the last two weeks have shown, probably cannot be done. War would poison the relationship between Israeli Jews and the one million Palestinian citizens of that state. Israel is neither as tough nor as ruthless a society as it used to be, nor can it afford a fundamental clash with the US, which has to balance its leaning toward Israel with its important relationships with Arab states.

As the Palestinians grasped that this was the only state they were likely to get, they began to ponder how they might subvert such an Israeli strategy.

It left a smear of blood on its descent. With that, Israel and the Palestinians were effectively at war. In the tense moments before Israel exacted its retribution, witnesses described the scenes of horror in which it is thought three Israeli soldiers died at the hands of a Palestinian lynch mob. It was unclear exactly how many men there were, who they were or how their car had arrived in such a dangerous location at such a sensitive time. As the Israelis arrived at the police station yesterday morning, a crowd of more than 1,000 people was collecting around the corner at Ramallah's grand mosque for the double funeral of two men killed by Israeli soldiers. This was a crowd on the edge of reason, fired up by the bloody images on official television, by the martial music pounding out of radio stations and by the posters of dead Palestinians - some in school and scout uniforms - staring out from posters plastered all over town. In one fortnight the Palestinians have lost nearly 100 of their own. And almost every funeral, where gunmen firing in the air escort a corpse draped in the Palestinian colours to a martyr's grave, has ended with more violence. Yesterday's was a mob hungry for bloody revenge. 'Contempt for life' The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, called the killings \"a cold-blooded lynching\".

Tribal hatreds But no matter who the Israeli men were, and how they got to the police station on Nablus street, they were doomed. After the carnage of the last fortnight, tribal hatreds now rule the hearts of Israelis and Palestinians. Even long-term residents of Ramallah are fearful. \"I have lived here 31 years, but I cannot walk in Ramallah alone anymore because people think I am Jewish,\" said Elizabeth Khayyo, a local Armenian woman. \"Peace, peace, peace, that is all we have heard for more than five years.

      "bodyText": "The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, rushed back to Israel to try to prevent all-out war yesterday as a series of diplomatic initiatives round the region crumbled. Mr Annan cut short his visit to Lebanon to try to broker a truce as the fighting between Israel and the Palestinians reached a new pitch. He said there was an urgent need to convene a high-level security meeting between leaders from both sides, chaired by the US. He said: \"I appeal to all - leaders and citizens alike - to stop and think about what they are doing today and what kind of tomorrow they want for their children.\" Less than 24 hours earlier, Mr Annan, who had just met the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat, seemed hopeful about the prospect of talks on security. Within hours of this announcement, Palestinian youths had had killed two Israeli soldiers, prompting a revenge attack by Israel on Mr Arafat's compound. Mr Annan was in Beirut to try to secure the release of three Israeli soldiers seized by Hizbullah guerrillas and had passed a message for the Hizbullah leaders to the Iranian foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi. Mr Annan described the mob killing of two Israeli soldiers in a Ramallah police station on the West Bank yesterday as chilling. \"We are at risk of seeing a dangerous situation escalate to a crisis that could destabilise an entire region,\" he said. The new wave of violence undercut all the diplomatic shuttling and lobbying done over the last week by envoys from the US, Britain and other parts of the Middle East. At a Washington press conference the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, called for an immediate ceasefire and a return to negotiations. \"There needs to be a ceasefire by both sides. Neither Israelis nor Palestinians can gain from further killing,\" she said. Mrs Albright made separate appeals to Mr Arafat and then to the Israelis: \"I call upon the entire international community to join the United States in urging Chairman Arafat to take the steps necessary to bring this senseless and destructive cycle of fighting to an end.\" She added: \"No matter how justified they feel at the mob violence against their soldiers, we are calling on the Israelis to bring an immediate end to the current operations by the IDF [Israel Defence Force]. Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president who has acted as a mediator in the peace process, met Jordan's King Abdullah at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheik. In a statement issued before the Israeli airstrikes, the two leaders \"rejected the language of threats and the violence which will only lead to escalating the situation and terminating hopes for peace and stability in the region\". The Arab League said the Israeli raids on Palestinian targets were \"extremely dangerous\", and that escalation was destroying any hope for peace. \"It is a very dangerous and worrying action. We are closely following these developments, which are destroying the peace process,\" Esmat Abdel-Meguid, its secretary general, said. The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, at the end of a tour of the Middle East, described recent developments in the region as \"negative\". The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, who was in Israel and Gaza on Wednesday and Syria and Lebanon yesterday, had been trying to secure a compromise on the independent commission of inquiry into the killings of the last week. Mr Cook, who was last night debating whether to remain in the region or stick with his original plan to attend a European Union meeting at Biarritz, said he was \"greatly shocked\" to hear reports of an escalation of violence. \"The appalling cycle of violence must be stopped... I urge both sides to do their utmost to restore calm and resume the search for peace,\" he added. The French president, Jacques Chirac, who had been criticised by Israel last week for derailing peace negotiations in Paris, said: \"As the situation is deteriorating dangerously, I insistently urge each side to do nothing that would deal peace an irremediable blow.\" Earlier, the French government, the most pro-Arab of the European countries, urged the Palestinian authorities to punish those responsible for the deaths of the Israeli soldiers. Javier Solana, the European Union's chief foreign policy representative, another envoy to the region, said he was seeking the release of all Arab prisoners held by Israel in return for the release of the three kidnapped Israeli soldiers. Mr Solana held talks in Damascus with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. \u0095 Diplomatic players Kofi Annan The UN secretary general arrived in the Middle East on October 9 and has held crisis talks with Arab and Israeli leaders.

But it may not work out that way. Or if it does, the cost may be unbearably high.</p> <p>Perhaps the greatest tragedy of what is happening is that it seems to end the prospect of the peaceful coexistence that was the great hope of Oslo, when Yitzhak Rabin, then prime minister, grasped the hand of Yasser Arafat in 1993.</p> <p>But it is a double tragedy because, in reality, solving the problem of Israel-Palestine is not very complicated. In 1937, when the British ruled, Lord Peel's royal commission report concluded that with two competing nationalisms, the only solution was to divide this one small country between the two peoples who claimed it.</p> <p>It has taken a very long time for that simple truth to sink in. In Israel it was a view that only became respectable after the 1982 Lebanon war or, some would argue, after the intifada (uprising) which the Palestinians launched in 1987.</p> <p>But even as the idea was taking root, on the left and eventually in the centre of Israeli politics, the fatal dragon's teeth continued to be sown.</p> <p>The same settlements - some in reality fully-fledged cities - that now dot the bare hills around Jerusalem and in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, are in the very centre of the vortex of violence.</p> <p>The deadly Netzarim junction, scene of bloody clashes for a fortnight, guards a Jewish settlement inhabited by people who probably do not enjoy majority support in their own country.</p> <p>But Ehud Barak's version of peace, like Rabin's before him, was flawed by the assumption that the majority of these outposts would stay put, even after a final settlement.</p> <p>Yet Mr Barak acknowledged for the first time that Jerusalem could be the capital of an independent Palestine as well as Israel - exactly what prompted the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon's provocative visit to the Temple Mount.</p> <p>Hopes for a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians have suffered terrible blows before: Rabin's assassination by an Israeli extremist; the Hamas suicide bombings on buses, the grim interlude of Binyamin Netanyahu's rule.</p> <p>Israelis' great decisions about war, peace and territory have always been agonising, divisive. Now they confront a society stunned by the fury of the Palestinians - and likely to close ranks in the face of the savagery of a lynch mob in Ramallah.</p> <p>Neither side has a monopoly of wisdom as this terrible violence spirals. Liberal Israelis were shocked by the televised death of 12-year-old Mohammed al-Durrah in Gaza. Yet they despair too at Mr Arafat's inability or unwillingness to control his people.</p> <p>Israelis have seen Palestinians for too long through the sights of their guns. But the destruction of Joseph's Tomb in Nablus - a Jewish religious site, just like the Muslim holy places of east Jerusalem - does not augur well for mutual tolerance.</p> <p>Israelis were staring into an abyss of uncertainty last night. But one thing is clear: whatever happens next, it will be harder than ever to come to terms with the neighbours they are doomed to live with.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a></p>",

Perhaps the greatest tragedy of what is happening is that it seems to end the prospect of the peaceful coexistence that was the great hope of Oslo, when Yitzhak Rabin, then prime minister, grasped the hand of Yasser Arafat in 1993. But it is a double tragedy because, in reality, solving the problem of Israel-Palestine is not very complicated. In 1937, when the British ruled, Lord Peel's royal commission report concluded that with two competing nationalisms, the only solution was to divide this one small country between the two peoples who claimed it. It has taken a very long time for that simple truth to sink in. In Israel it was a view that only became respectable after the 1982 Lebanon war or, some would argue, after the intifada (uprising) which the Palestinians launched in 1987. But even as the idea was taking root, on the left and eventually in the centre of Israeli politics, the fatal dragon's teeth continued to be sown. The same settlements - some in reality fully-fledged cities - that now dot the bare hills around Jerusalem and in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, are in the very centre of the vortex of violence. The deadly Netzarim junction, scene of bloody clashes for a fortnight, guards a Jewish settlement inhabited by people who probably do not enjoy majority support in their own country. But Ehud Barak's version of peace, like Rabin's before him, was flawed by the assumption that the majority of these outposts would stay put, even after a final settlement. Yet Mr Barak acknowledged for the first time that Jerusalem could be the capital of an independent Palestine as well as Israel - exactly what prompted the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon's provocative visit to the Temple Mount. Hopes for a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians have suffered terrible blows before: Rabin's assassination by an Israeli extremist; the Hamas suicide bombings on buses, the grim interlude of Binyamin Netanyahu's rule. Israelis' great decisions about war, peace and territory have always been agonising, divisive. Now they confront a society stunned by the fury of the Palestinians - and likely to close ranks in the face of the savagery of a lynch mob in Ramallah. Neither side has a monopoly of wisdom as this terrible violence spirals. Liberal Israelis were shocked by the televised death of 12-year-old Mohammed al-Durrah in Gaza. Yet they despair too at Mr Arafat's inability or unwillingness to control his people. Israelis have seen Palestinians for too long through the sights of their guns. But the destruction of Joseph's Tomb in Nablus - a Jewish religious site, just like the Muslim holy places of east Jerusalem - does not augur well for mutual tolerance. Israelis were staring into an abyss of uncertainty last night. But one thing is clear: whatever happens next, it will be harder than ever to come to terms with the neighbours they are doomed to live with.

After a day of mob and military violence all hope of peace in the Middle East seemed extinguished. Palestinian officials said they considered the attacks by helicopter gunships on installations in the West Bank and Gaza a blatant act of aggression. \"This is a declaration of war - a crazy war,\" said Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator. The attacks marked the first Israeli offensive against Palestinian targets since 1994. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, last night declared he would form an government of national unity within three days which would include the broadest possible coalition. The statement implied the inclusion of Ariel Sharon, the rightwing Likud leader whose visit to the Temple Mount two weeks ago sparked the Palestinian revolt.

In a militant response to the bombing, he said: \"Our people don't care, and don't hesitate to continue their march to Jerusalem, their capital of the independent Palestinian state,\" he said. The day's events began soon after 9am (BST) when a Palestinian lynch mob hacked, beat and burnt to death at least two, and possibly three, plainclothed Israeli reservists at a police station in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Israeli military officials said the men had been reporting for duty at a nearby settlement but had strayed into a Palestinian checkpoint where they were taken prisoner. Five hours later Israel retaliated by attacking targets in the West Bank and Gaza.

At least 27 people were reported injured in the attacks. By early evening the army announced an end to the attacks. But with passions inflamed to a new level it was clear that a fresh chapter had been opened in the Middle East crisis. The first helicopters struck at 3pm, taking out the top floor of the central Ramallah police station where the Israeli soldiers had been held, shattering windows and destroying cars parked nearby. About half an hour later they struck another police station, setting off a fire whose smoke was visible for miles. \"They could have killed many people,\" said a blood-spattered Palestinian doctor, who was surrounded by crowds of flag-waving youths. \"This is just the organised killing of the Palestinian people.\" Israel hoped its helicopters would send the Palestinians a strong signal. It appears the message has gone unheeded. \"We will continue fighting,\" said Marwan Barghouti, a leader of Mr Arafat's Fatah faction.\"This will never stop us.\" Within minutes of the Israeli attack that sentiment had percolated down to the streets of Ramallah.\"I am not afraid,\" said Nabil Khatib, standing near the flames from one police station. \"But as Palestinians now our aim is absolutely clear: a Palestinian state with a capital in Jerusalem. Until that happens, there is no peace.\"",

      "byline": "Michael Ellison",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When he started putting his latest novel about, Brian O'Doherty had reason to believe that there might be some interest: he had published several books already, was well-connected and had a distinguished track record stretching back 40 years across the arts. </p> <p>He was a professor of fine arts whose work is in the collections of the Met and the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan and the Pompidou Centre in Paris; he had made an award-winning film about his friend, the painter Edward Hopper; written and presented television series; and held a senior position for nearly 20 years on the US equivalent of the Arts Council. </p> <p>In short, 72-year-old O'Doherty had done rather a lot for a writer described as an unknown when he was shortlisted for the Booker prize. \"It was a despised book that I had put all my heart and soul into,\" he says, sitting by the swimming pool of his weathered-wood home in the Hamptons, at the far end of Long Island. \"It went round and round the publishers. They said: 'Well, I suppose it is well written, but who needs another dark Irish novel?' They turned it down, sometimes contemptuously. I don't mind being turned down in this life, but don't do that.\" </p> <p>Even now that The Deposition of Father McGreevy has earned a measure of recognition for its literary merit, the indignities have not receded entirely. The amazon.com listing for O'Doherty's book suggests that if you have enjoyed it you might like to try, among others, Knick Knack Paddy Whack, by the comedian Ardal O'Hanlon. </p> <p>O'Doherty laughs this off, as he does many things, the irreverent Irishman at the heart of American high culture. During a break in a lunch of turkey and caesar salad he leans across and creases his lean face, under a flop of silver hair, into a rude story \"while the ladies are away\". This involves a misunderstanding of the term \"a U-turn\" by a gentleman who \"can bring tears to a ewe's eyes\" and is not entirely gratuitous, given an episode in his novel. </p> <p>But if the big publishers had had their way we would never have got this far, to the bright, open-plan house surrounded by trees and lifted by art that he shares with his wife of 40 years, the painter and art historian Barbara Novak. The Deposition of Father McGreevy was taken up and championed by some of his influential friends in Manhattan and elsewhere, but it made no difference. He received a letter from Seamus Deane, who won the Guardian fiction prize and was himself shortlisted for the Booker, for Reading in the Dark. That was reassuring, but it still did not get O'Doherty's book into print. \"It's good to have a friend in court, but the court wasn't there,\" he says. </p> <p>Finally, the manuscript fell into the hands of a man who was a rare part of the writer's forgotten past. Jonathan Rabinowitz was a small publisher who, 25 years previously, had taken a class in art writing at Columbia University. \"Slowly, a very remote penny dropped,\" says O'Doherty. \"I remembered a very dark, insecure man who had done the best work in many years. At the end, he disappeared before I ever spoke to him. A great writer was lost and instead went into the great industry of publishing.\" </p> <p>Rabinowitz's Turtle Point Press published the book, the reviews were good and O'Doherty was entitled to feel rather pleased with himself, especially when the Booker judges paid attention. \"The Booker is validation for toil, sweat and the joy of writing,\" he says. </p> <p>Father McGreevy is an allegory about a village on the west coast of Ireland, destroyed by illness, gossip and rumour at the end of the 1930s. The events, recorded in a deposition by the local priest, are picked up decades later by a journalist in a pub in London. The author is proud that he has given the Irish language a starring role. </p> <p>Rabinowitz, understandably, is also delighted. \"The Booker means a great deal in the US. The phone's been ringing off the hook.\" In fact, the Booker shortlist receives scant mention in the mainstream US press, and is nothing compared with the internecine literary dogfights in the British isles. </p> <p>It is perhaps a testament to the broad outlook of the new Ireland that this was represented as well in Dublin as in mainland Britain. \"The panel should hang its head in shame,\" said the Irish Times, despite the fact that the list includes two Irish writers (though both, admittedly, live abroad). </p> <p>When the nominees are announced for the National Book Award, the Booker's nearest equivalent in the US, it appears in the press without any great fanfare and a month later the prize is awarded. Yesterday's New York Times welcomed this year's selection with the sanguine headline: \"National Book Award Finalists Announced\". The piece below it proceeds from start to finish without anyone having a cultural seizure or denouncing the judges as \"wankers\", as one British publisher did when Vikram Seth was excluded from the Booker list seven years ago. </p> <p>O'Doherty prefers to draw encouragement from the disputatious approach, and nothing would keep him away from the Booker prize dinner at the Guildhall in London on November 7. \"I'm glad someone's worked up about literature,\" he says. \"I'm going there with bells on. I know I'm an outsider, but what is greater than the unexpected?\" </p> <p>Indeed, much about O'Doherty is unexpected. For one thing, he is also Patrick Ireland. This was the name he adopted, and under which he has shown all his art, since Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in 1972. \"That was very upsetting and there was nothing I could do about it,\" he says. His conceptual art, paintings and sculptures will continue to appear under that name until the British military presence has been removed from Northern Ireland. </p> <p>But O'Doherty/Ireland goes out of his way to say: \"Patrick Ireland is not a terrorist. I've been accused of that. I don't hate the British or the Irish or the church.\" He makes a point also of mentioning the five presidents of the US with a Protestant Irish background, and makes light of his adoption of dual US/Irish citizenship. He did it, he says, only because his wife got fed up waiting for him at the non-US citizens queue at Kennedy airport. </p> <p>\"I said, 'Now I'll have to take responsibility for Vietnam and the repression of minorities.' I've had people come up to me and say, 'You're the spit of Brian O'Doherty, but he's much nicer.' \" </p> <p>Patrick Ireland is only one of his alternative identities. O'Doherty, who was born in Ballaghaderrin, county Roscommon, trained for what he calls the family business and practised as a doctor when he was a young man. He continued to paint all the while and a year working in a cancer hospital was enough to convince him that it was time for a change. \"After that, nothing matters that much.\" </p> <p>New York had always been his goal and he moved to the US in 1957. \"What I am, I am because of America. It's the American dream, in a way.\" His dream took him into a world peopled by painters such as Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock's widow Lee Krasner (Pollock had died the year before). </p> <p>A retrospective of Krasner's work has opened recently at Brooklyn Museum of Art, but his wife is hesitant about going. The couple are confirmed Manhattanites, and Brooklyn does not figure much on their schedule, even if it is much closer to their apartment on the Upper West Side than is their home in the Hamptons where, they make plain, they are not part of the social set. </p> <p>He took a job working as an art critic on the New York Times. He was a naughty boy in those days, he says - he is sorry to see that journalists affect a preference for mineral water with lunch these days - but this did not exactly hold him back. Later he was an arts reporter on network television, won a prize for writing and directing a documentary, published several books about art and spent 19 years as director of film, radio and television programmes at the National Endowment for the Arts. He also found time for more than 40 one-man shows devoted to his work, and is still professor of fine arts and media at the Southampton College campus of Long Island University. </p> <p>All this, and yet he describes seeing Stanley Matthews play football as one of the transcendent moments of his life. He has time, too, for the former German international sweeper Franz Beckenbauer, and will be spending this evening watching the New York Mets - dismissed by Yankees fans as New York's \"other baseball club\" - attempt to win a place in the World Series. He supports the Mets because of their blue-collar, underdog status. </p> <p>O'Doherty and Novak never had children and, while there were small regrets at one time, they are satisfied that they have led full lives. Or, at least, she is. He wishes he had become a full-time film director. That, he says, would have been the field in which he could have made best use of all his talents. Now there is not enough time left. \"I was not going to let other people determine the limits of my life. I believe deeply that our social pressures and lives limit people enormously and nullify their potential for development. People have more in them than they allow.\"</p>",

In short, 72-year-old O'Doherty had done rather a lot for a writer described as an unknown when he was shortlisted for the Booker prize. \"It was a despised book that I had put all my heart and soul into,\" he says, sitting by the swimming pool of his weathered-wood home in the Hamptons, at the far end of Long Island. \"It went round and round the publishers. They said: 'Well, I suppose it is well written, but who needs another dark Irish novel?' They turned it down, sometimes contemptuously. I don't mind being turned down in this life, but don't do that.\" Even now that The Deposition of Father McGreevy has earned a measure of recognition for its literary merit, the indignities have not receded entirely. The amazon.com listing for O'Doherty's book suggests that if you have enjoyed it you might like to try, among others, Knick Knack Paddy Whack, by the comedian Ardal O'Hanlon. O'Doherty laughs this off, as he does many things, the irreverent Irishman at the heart of American high culture. During a break in a lunch of turkey and caesar salad he leans across and creases his lean face, under a flop of silver hair, into a rude story \"while the ladies are away\". This involves a misunderstanding of the term \"a U-turn\" by a gentleman who \"can bring tears to a ewe's eyes\" and is not entirely gratuitous, given an episode in his novel. But if the big publishers had had their way we would never have got this far, to the bright, open-plan house surrounded by trees and lifted by art that he shares with his wife of 40 years, the painter and art historian Barbara Novak. The Deposition of Father McGreevy was taken up and championed by some of his influential friends in Manhattan and elsewhere, but it made no difference. He received a letter from Seamus Deane, who won the Guardian fiction prize and was himself shortlisted for the Booker, for Reading in the Dark. That was reassuring, but it still did not get O'Doherty's book into print. \"It's good to have a friend in court, but the court wasn't there,\" he says. Finally, the manuscript fell into the hands of a man who was a rare part of the writer's forgotten past. Jonathan Rabinowitz was a small publisher who, 25 years previously, had taken a class in art writing at Columbia University. \"Slowly, a very remote penny dropped,\" says O'Doherty. \"I remembered a very dark, insecure man who had done the best work in many years. At the end, he disappeared before I ever spoke to him. A great writer was lost and instead went into the great industry of publishing.\" Rabinowitz's Turtle Point Press published the book, the reviews were good and O'Doherty was entitled to feel rather pleased with himself, especially when the Booker judges paid attention. \"The Booker is validation for toil, sweat and the joy of writing,\" he says. Father McGreevy is an allegory about a village on the west coast of Ireland, destroyed by illness, gossip and rumour at the end of the 1930s. The events, recorded in a deposition by the local priest, are picked up decades later by a journalist in a pub in London. The author is proud that he has given the Irish language a starring role. Rabinowitz, understandably, is also delighted. \"The Booker means a great deal in the US. The phone's been ringing off the hook.\" In fact, the Booker shortlist receives scant mention in the mainstream US press, and is nothing compared with the internecine literary dogfights in the British isles. It is perhaps a testament to the broad outlook of the new Ireland that this was represented as well in Dublin as in mainland Britain. \"The panel should hang its head in shame,\" said the Irish Times, despite the fact that the list includes two Irish writers (though both, admittedly, live abroad). When the nominees are announced for the National Book Award, the Booker's nearest equivalent in the US, it appears in the press without any great fanfare and a month later the prize is awarded. Yesterday's New York Times welcomed this year's selection with the sanguine headline: \"National Book Award Finalists Announced\". The piece below it proceeds from start to finish without anyone having a cultural seizure or denouncing the judges as \"wankers\", as one British publisher did when Vikram Seth was excluded from the Booker list seven years ago. O'Doherty prefers to draw encouragement from the disputatious approach, and nothing would keep him away from the Booker prize dinner at the Guildhall in London on November 7. \"I'm glad someone's worked up about literature,\" he says. \"I'm going there with bells on. I know I'm an outsider, but what is greater than the unexpected?\" Indeed, much about O'Doherty is unexpected. For one thing, he is also Patrick Ireland. This was the name he adopted, and under which he has shown all his art, since Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in 1972. \"That was very upsetting and there was nothing I could do about it,\" he says. His conceptual art, paintings and sculptures will continue to appear under that name until the British military presence has been removed from Northern Ireland. But O'Doherty/Ireland goes out of his way to say: \"Patrick Ireland is not a terrorist. I've been accused of that. I don't hate the British or the Irish or the church.\" He makes a point also of mentioning the five presidents of the US with a Protestant Irish background, and makes light of his adoption of dual US/Irish citizenship. He did it, he says, only because his wife got fed up waiting for him at the non-US citizens queue at Kennedy airport. \"I said, 'Now I'll have to take responsibility for Vietnam and the repression of minorities.' I've had people come up to me and say, 'You're the spit of Brian O'Doherty, but he's much nicer.' \" Patrick Ireland is only one of his alternative identities. O'Doherty, who was born in Ballaghaderrin, county Roscommon, trained for what he calls the family business and practised as a doctor when he was a young man. He continued to paint all the while and a year working in a cancer hospital was enough to convince him that it was time for a change. \"After that, nothing matters that much.\" New York had always been his goal and he moved to the US in 1957. \"What I am, I am because of America. It's the American dream, in a way.\" His dream took him into a world peopled by painters such as Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock's widow Lee Krasner (Pollock had died the year before). A retrospective of Krasner's work has opened recently at Brooklyn Museum of Art, but his wife is hesitant about going. The couple are confirmed Manhattanites, and Brooklyn does not figure much on their schedule, even if it is much closer to their apartment on the Upper West Side than is their home in the Hamptons where, they make plain, they are not part of the social set. He took a job working as an art critic on the New York Times. He was a naughty boy in those days, he says - he is sorry to see that journalists affect a preference for mineral water with lunch these days - but this did not exactly hold him back. Later he was an arts reporter on network television, won a prize for writing and directing a documentary, published several books about art and spent 19 years as director of film, radio and television programmes at the National Endowment for the Arts. He also found time for more than 40 one-man shows devoted to his work, and is still professor of fine arts and media at the Southampton College campus of Long Island University. All this, and yet he describes seeing Stanley Matthews play football as one of the transcendent moments of his life. He has time, too, for the former German international sweeper Franz Beckenbauer, and will be spending this evening watching the New York Mets - dismissed by Yankees fans as New York's \"other baseball club\" - attempt to win a place in the World Series. He supports the Mets because of their blue-collar, underdog status. O'Doherty and Novak never had children and, while there were small regrets at one time, they are satisfied that they have led full lives. Or, at least, she is. He wishes he had become a full-time film director. That, he says, would have been the field in which he could have made best use of all his talents. Now there is not enough time left. \"I was not going to let other people determine the limits of my life. I believe deeply that our social pressures and lives limit people enormously and nullify their potential for development. People have more in them than they allow.\"",

Only 4% said \"for food.\"</p> <p>Crisis chief executive, Shaks Ghosh, said: \"If you tackle begging, you don't have to tackle giving. The thing you really want to remove is begging.\"</p> <p>Beggars and street drinkers needed to be given an alternative which is better than the street, Ms Ghosh said, point ing out that some hostels, particularly with large numbers of drug users, can be frightening places, or offer nothing for people to do. She also called for more investment in drug detoxification projects.</p> <p>Ms Ghosh, whose charity was not represented at the Brighton meeting, added that it was wrong for the government to suppress dissent by threatening funding. \"Charities in a sense are the conscience of the nation and we must be allowed to follow our consciences.

      "bodyText": "The government's homelessness tsar has threatened to withdraw funding from charities which refuse to back its controversial anti-begging campaign. The planned \u00a3240,000 advertising blitz urging people not to give on the streets has provoked criticism that drug users will turn instead to theft or prostitution to finance their habits. At a private meeting chaired by a Home Office minister, the head of the government's rough sleepers unit, Louise Casey, warned charities: \"Anybody who is touched by my funding, and doesn't sign up, has got to come up and see me later - if you want out.\" The strategy to which charities were required to \"sign up\" involves setting up an \"alternative giving fund\" with collection points in shops and pubs where the public will be invited to donate rather than give directly to beggars, a source at the meeting said. The meeting last Friday in Brighton, which has one of the highest concentrations of rough sleepers, was chaired by Lord Bassam, himself a former squatter. Lord Bassam reiterated the government's stern line on beggars when he told a local newspaper afterwards: \"I would like to see a more positive street culture in Brighton and less harassment of people by beggars and Big Issue sell ers.\" The claim of aggressive begging was yesterday dismissed by Jenny Backwell, director of Brighton Housing Trust, who was at the meeting. She attacked the anti-begging campaign, which will be launched with adverts in national newspapers and magazines four weeks before Christmas, as \"extremely simplistic. \"Without help, people are not just going to stop [taking drugs] because you hit them on the money front,\" she said. \"I am not in favour of begging because it is unpleasant for everybody - it's unpleasant for the people that do it. \"But I would rather people sit by a cash machine and ask for spare change, than stand by a cash machine and bang me on the head when I get money out.\" A study published by the charity Crisis today lends weight to the government's analysis that money given to beggars is spent on drugs and alcohol. Crisis researchers questioned 202 beggars and street drinkers in eight locations across the UK and found that 42% said they had started begging \"to get money for drink or drugs\". Only 4% said \"for food.\" Crisis chief executive, Shaks Ghosh, said: \"If you tackle begging, you don't have to tackle giving. The thing you really want to remove is begging.\" Beggars and street drinkers needed to be given an alternative which is better than the street, Ms Ghosh said, point ing out that some hostels, particularly with large numbers of drug users, can be frightening places, or offer nothing for people to do. She also called for more investment in drug detoxification projects. Ms Ghosh, whose charity was not represented at the Brighton meeting, added that it was wrong for the government to suppress dissent by threatening funding. \"Charities in a sense are the conscience of the nation and we must be allowed to follow our consciences. We should get funding on the basis of whether our projects make a difference. Money should not be contingent on agreeing with government policies.\" Ms Casey yesterday insisted her comments to charities were about getting good value for \"the taxpayer's money. If you are taking money from the rough sleepers' unit you have got to buy in to the prime minister's strategy - otherwise why are you taking the taxpayer's money?\" Stephen Sharpe, chief executive of Brighton charity St Patrick's Trust, stressed that the discouragement of alms giving was being combined with investment. His trust runs a hostel where 12 new emergency beds will open next week with government backing. \"We wouldn't be supporting this if it was just a case of 'don't give to beggars', without a package of support and care,\" he said.",

An average-sized farm of 202 hectares (500 acres) which earned \u00a380,000 in the mid-1990s is now bringing in just \u00a38,000 and might be running up losses of \u00a34,000 next year, according to a survey of the company's agricultural clients, mainly in England and in the arable sector. They are the worst financial results in the survey's 11-year history with an average 28% drop in income during 1999-2000. The figures came as no surprise to farmers' leaders who predicted more unemployment in the industry which shed 22,000 jobs in the year to last June. The industry blames the strength of the pound, high fuel prices and red tape. The continuing reduction in the number of small, local abattoirs and the high cost of hygiene charges are also adding to the problems of livestock farmers. Deloitte and Touche said that income per hectare (2.5 acres) had fallen from \u00a357 to \u00a341 last year and that profit would turn into a loss of \u00a322 during this financial year. The figures might not even indicate the full extent of the problems since the survey represents few clients in the livestock sector. Mark Hill,of Deloitte and Touche, said: \" The increase in non-farming income shows that farmers are looking to use their skills and resources more widely.\" Ben Gill, president of the National Farmers' Union, said: \"The public has witnessed the devastation of trade and businesses in this country's pig sector and the pressures facing dairy farmers.

      "body": "<p>The funeral of Scotland's first minister, Donald Dewar, will take place next Wednesday in Glasgow, the city of his birth.</p> <p>Mr Dewar's family had hoped for a private ceremony but were said to have been moved by the outpouring of grief at his death and had acknowledged the need for a public farewell. The setting will be Glasgow Cathedral. It is likely to be one of the largest funerals Scotland has ever seen.</p> <p>Tributes have continued to flood in for Mr Dewar who died in hospital on Wednesday from a brain haemorrhage at the age of 63.</p> <p>Flags across Scotland are at half-mast and condolence books have been filled with messages of warmth and sorrow.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, was among the first to sign a condolence book in the Scottish parliament building yesterday. He left a simple statement: \"In affection, respect and gratitude.\"</p> <p>Bouquets have also been left outside Bute House, Mr Dewar's official residence in Edinburgh, where he took the tumble on Tuesday that led to his death.</p> <p>President Clinton sent a message of support to Mr Dewar's family, and in London, ministers held a minute's silence in memory of Mr Dewar when they gathered for the cabinet meeting. The prime minister told them that while there would be other occasions to mark Mr Dewar's life, they should stand in silence in memory of his \"contribution to the country, parliament, the cabinet, the Labour party and the people of Scotland\".</p> <p>Later today the Scottish parliament will reconvene from the autumn recess for a special sitting to remember Mr Dewar. Tributes will be led by the leaders of the opposition parties and the public has been invited to take part.</p> <p>The parliament now has 27 days to approve the person who will take over the leadership of the devolved body - a timeframe written into the Scotland Act by Mr Dewar. If the deadline is not met, the parliament would be dissolved.</p> <p>The Scottish Labour party, however, must use an electoral college to decide who its new leader and nominee for first minister is to be, and party sources say it will be difficult to do in the time available.</p> <p>Immediately following Mr Dewar's death there was talk of a sole candidate, most probably the enterprise minister, Henry McLeish, being put forward to avoid a bitter succession battle.

      "bodyText": "The funeral of Scotland's first minister, Donald Dewar, will take place next Wednesday in Glasgow, the city of his birth. Mr Dewar's family had hoped for a private ceremony but were said to have been moved by the outpouring of grief at his death and had acknowledged the need for a public farewell. The setting will be Glasgow Cathedral. It is likely to be one of the largest funerals Scotland has ever seen. Tributes have continued to flood in for Mr Dewar who died in hospital on Wednesday from a brain haemorrhage at the age of 63. Flags across Scotland are at half-mast and condolence books have been filled with messages of warmth and sorrow. The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, was among the first to sign a condolence book in the Scottish parliament building yesterday. He left a simple statement: \"In affection, respect and gratitude.\" Bouquets have also been left outside Bute House, Mr Dewar's official residence in Edinburgh, where he took the tumble on Tuesday that led to his death. President Clinton sent a message of support to Mr Dewar's family, and in London, ministers held a minute's silence in memory of Mr Dewar when they gathered for the cabinet meeting. The prime minister told them that while there would be other occasions to mark Mr Dewar's life, they should stand in silence in memory of his \"contribution to the country, parliament, the cabinet, the Labour party and the people of Scotland\". Later today the Scottish parliament will reconvene from the autumn recess for a special sitting to remember Mr Dewar. Tributes will be led by the leaders of the opposition parties and the public has been invited to take part. The parliament now has 27 days to approve the person who will take over the leadership of the devolved body - a timeframe written into the Scotland Act by Mr Dewar. If the deadline is not met, the parliament would be dissolved. The Scottish Labour party, however, must use an electoral college to decide who its new leader and nominee for first minister is to be, and party sources say it will be difficult to do in the time available. Immediately following Mr Dewar's death there was talk of a sole candidate, most probably the enterprise minister, Henry McLeish, being put forward to avoid a bitter succession battle. However, supporters of the finance minister, Jack McConnell, another front-runner, were said to have dismissed that idea. Yesterday, there were suggestions that Labour may pick an interim leader who would become first minister within the deadline. There would then be a full leadership contest to confirm or overturn the appointment. In the meantime, the deputy first minister, Jim Wallace, of the Liberal Democrats, has stepped in to act as first minister until the 28-day deadline is up. Two further members of the Scottish cabinet have also been named as possible contenders for the post; the health minister, Susan Deacon, and the communities minister, Wendy Alexander. It is unlikely, however, that any will throw their hat into the ring until Mr Dewar has been buried. There will also have to be byelections for Mr Dewar's Anniesland constituency. It emerged yesterday that Mr Dewar had left orders that his organs be used for transplant following his death. His family is said to have honoured his wishes He had been on a life support machine at Edinburgh's Western general hospital after losing consciousness at 7pm on Tuesday .",

They argue that allowing the home secretary to set the \"tariff\" breaches the right to a fair trial guaranteed by article 6 of the European convention on human rights, because in effect a politician rather than a judge fixes the sentence. Last December in a case brought by the murderers of two-year-old James Bulger, the Strasbourg court removed the home secretary's right to set a tariff for underage killers sentenced to detention at her majesty's pleasure - the juvenile equivalent of a life sentence for murder.

A spokesman at the Kielder Bird of Prey Centre reports ads offering barn owl chicks for sale as pets. These will grow into large birds destined to spend their lives in cramped cages. The term \"owling\" was given to the 18th-century practice of smuggling wool out of England to France. The men (owlers), carrying the wool on their back, had an owlish outline in the dusk.",

On the whole I feel positive about being single. Since my relationship ended I have developed a new network of friends and I have joined several societies.</p> <p>My dilemma is that many of my friends are married with children. I have found that if I wish to see them at the weekend, I have to make the arrangements. I appreciate that they are busy, but I wonder if it is worth inviting people round who then never invite me back. Recently some friends were invited to a wedding at which my ex-boyfriend was the best man. I had known the groom from university and seen him frequently over the last four years, yet I did not receive an invitation. I was upset that some people who were happy to meet up with me when I was part of a couple no longer want to include me in their activities.</p> <p>I would like to meet more people of my own age (early 30s) who are single. My job involves working with people in their 40s and 50s, so I am unlikely to make friends through work.

I have been single since I split up with my fianc\u00e9e five years ago; I am 31, and enjoy life enormously. I lead a very full life, and I really appreciate the flexibility that singleness brings, in terms of deciding what I do, when, and with whom. If I feel like going away for the weekend at the last minute, I just go, and don't need to ask anyone's permission.</p> <p>While it is true to say that I am not so close as I used to be to my married friends, many of whom have children, I have many more friends now than I ever did while I was part of a couple, encompassing people from a far wider cross-section of ages and backgrounds. My life is filled with variety, I have an interesting job and feel like I'm able to be \"me\". How? By making the most of the advantages of the flexibility that singleness brings, like being able to change jobs quickly, take part in a wide range of different social activities, and generally building up more and more of the confidence I need to lead the life I want.</p> <p>Find out what you enjoy doing, find some new friends who like doing these things, and have fun. It takes perseverance, though, and can feel like you're on a rollercoaster ride some of the time, but it's worth taking the longest possible view.</p> <p>Steve Mitchell, Brighton</p> <p><b> It's time to move on</b></p> <p>Like you, after years of trying to keep up relationships with friends who have had children, I've given up, although it's a cause of great sadness in my life. It's not through want of trying on my part - I make a real effort to keep in touch, am happy to visit them and play with their offspring, and try and suggest social activities that fit in with their children's lives. But eventually the return calls dry up and then even the Christmas cards stop coming.</p> <p>But you have to move on, and there are people out there who would be happy to have you as a friend, it just takes time. I moved to a new area this year and for several months thought I would never have any friends again, but eventually things start to fall into place. It is hard, but you say you have a new network of friends and have joined several societies so it sounds like you're doing all the right things.</p> <p>And by the way, don't automatically write off your work colleagues just because they're older. They can still be great fun, and through them you could meet more people your own age.</p> <p>Name and address withheld</p> <p><b> Hang on in there</b><br></p> <p>I also broke up with a boyfriend after four years about two years ago. I experienced the same kind of feelings about my friends who had relationships and children. Initially I felt hurt that they did not seem to have time for me, but I realise now that their lives were taken up so much with offspring, partners and work that I expect their intentions to phone me were often sidetracked. I recognised that they were always pleased to hear from me or to suggest a better time to ring, so I kept phoning. As the children got older the pressure eased off a bit and they began to be able to give others more attention, so hang on in there.</p> <p>As someone once said to me, if you need the people, you need to keep in touch. I appreciate that this will not solve your immediate social problem. I suggest that you try indulging in some of your own personal interests. Have you never wanted to learn to do something, go somewhere, try something? Well now's your chance, there's no one to stop you. You will have the satisfaction of doing something you want to, and although there are no guarantees, you will be amongst people that you have something in common with and so have more of a chance of hitting it off.</p> <p>I have no suggestions about your social exclusions. I think this kind of thing has to be put down to experience, as it often happens with groups of friends when someone splits up.</p> <p>Name and address withheld</p> <p><b> Seek out old friends</b><br></p> <p>Friends are people who share common interests and your current ones do not include being part of a couple. It is inevitable over time, as people and their situations change, that friends will change as well. With this in mind it may be more worth your while to concentrate your attentions on other single people. Look up old friends and acquaintances - do you know any that are single? One email here and a phone call there will help you find other people in the same boat. If there are any single people in the societies that you have joined, get to know them better as well. You will be surprised how many people are in the same situation but you must actively look for them and make the effort to get to know them.</p> <p>Of course, do not dismiss your other friends even though it is upsetting when you feel left out or forgotten about by all the couples around you. Many couples feel awkward around single people. They don't know how to act and may think that you would feel left out surrounded by couples. They probably feel as bad for not asking you as you feel about not being asked. Eventually you will rejoin the clan and it will be as though you have never left. It's just one of those social oddities.</p> <p>Jane Buckley, Manchester</p> <p><b>Next week</b></p> <p>I am a happily married family man in my late 40s. I was gay at school and remember having a secret admiration for muscular boys (shades of Charles Atlas). Gradually I turned straight and over many years have been aware of admiring muscular women. There is nothing sexual here, just admiration of the strong female physique.</p> <p>As (bad?) luck would have it, I have discovered on the internet that some women body builders offer \"muscle worship\" sessions and I am seriously tempted to indulge what seems to have been a life-long fantasy. Inevitably I feel ashamed and embarrassed. Should I go? Should I tell my family? Or should I just repress my feelings and get on with living? How on earth do I broach the subject? Being naturally shy, I don't know who to consult: are these thoughts innocuous, a waste of time, or even worse, decidedly unhealthy?</p> <p>\u0095 Private Lives appears every Friday.

You will have the satisfaction of doing something you want to, and although there are no guarantees, you will be amongst people that you have something in common with and so have more of a chance of hitting it off. I have no suggestions about your social exclusions. I think this kind of thing has to be put down to experience, as it often happens with groups of friends when someone splits up. Name and address withheld Seek out old friends Friends are people who share common interests and your current ones do not include being part of a couple. It is inevitable over time, as people and their situations change, that friends will change as well. With this in mind it may be more worth your while to concentrate your attentions on other single people. Look up old friends and acquaintances - do you know any that are single? One email here and a phone call there will help you find other people in the same boat. If there are any single people in the societies that you have joined, get to know them better as well. You will be surprised how many people are in the same situation but you must actively look for them and make the effort to get to know them. Of course, do not dismiss your other friends even though it is upsetting when you feel left out or forgotten about by all the couples around you. Many couples feel awkward around single people. They don't know how to act and may think that you would feel left out surrounded by couples. They probably feel as bad for not asking you as you feel about not being asked. Eventually you will rejoin the clan and it will be as though you have never left. It's just one of those social oddities. Jane Buckley, Manchester Next week I am a happily married family man in my late 40s. I was gay at school and remember having a secret admiration for muscular boys (shades of Charles Atlas). Gradually I turned straight and over many years have been aware of admiring muscular women. There is nothing sexual here, just admiration of the strong female physique. As (bad?) luck would have it, I have discovered on the internet that some women body builders offer \"muscle worship\" sessions and I am seriously tempted to indulge what seems to have been a life-long fantasy. Inevitably I feel ashamed and embarrassed. Should I go? Should I tell my family? Or should I just repress my feelings and get on with living? How on earth do I broach the subject? Being naturally shy, I don't know who to consult: are these thoughts innocuous, a waste of time, or even worse, decidedly unhealthy? \u0095 Private Lives appears every Friday.

      "body": "<p>Some people can identify a defining moment in their childhood - an incident that brings an idea to mind which is then indelibly fixed in the psyche. For Gelding - an adopted alias for the American internet guru to all wanna-be eunuchs - that moment came when he was 12 years old and thrown against an older boy in a packed bus. \"Do that again and I'll crush 'em,\" said the older boy, grabbing his genitals. The pain was as piercing as the pleasure. And so began a lifetime's quest to be castrated.</p> <p>In the UK, self-motivated castration mainly exists only in the most extreme S&amp;M scene, while in America those aspiring to be castrated comprise a burgeoning and divergent tribe made up of both gay and straight men. Men who want to be castrated fit no stereotype, have no common neuroses or childhood experience. Some are androgynous types (thin and underdeveloped) who want to remain in a prepubescent, asexual phase, others are eroto-phobes who don't like to feel driven by their libidos and want to become surgically tranquillised. Some want to be feminised, a few - known as nullos or smoothies - want to become nullified by having their penis removed along with their testicles.</p> <p>In Gelding's experience a quarter of those who get castrated continue to regulate their libidos with testosterone, which allows them to have full sex. But what compulsion drives grown men to be castrated in the first place? According to Gelding, for most men the desire to be castrated stems from puberty but does not develop into a fixation for at least 10 years.</p> <p>This was certainly his experience. Now in his early 50s, he has been without his testicles for six years and is keen to point out that he has no desire to be feminised. Growing up in rural New York State, he knew he was gay from childhood, but it was only in his mid-20s, while working for the military in a top security position, that he discovered the gay S&amp;M scene and a world where castration was honoured rather than abhorred.</p> <p>One of his first boyfriends was a cutter - a man who worked in the netherworld of the gay S&amp;M scene, cutting off men's testicles, consensually and safely. By 1991 Gelding's testicles had become an unbearable affront to him. The idea of cutting aroused him sexually, but more than that, there was an aching need to be rid of something that had begun to take a stranglehold of his life.</p> <p>At first he tried to cut off the offending items himself by using rubber bands as a tourniquet and drenching his balls in ice water. But after an hour he ran out of adrenaline and went into clinical shock. In hospital a horrified A&amp;E surgeon castigated him for trying to remove healthy tissue. Three years later he went to a cutter in California and got rid of them safely and efficiently. \"I've never felt more myself, more complete or happy,\" he says, unemotionally.</p> <p>In order to receive the testosterone that he requires to keep him functioning as a man (he has occasional erectile problems but can still ejaculate) he has devised a cover story which makes him eligible for medical treatment. The story is posted up on the web and tells how he lost his balls against his will in a gay S&amp;M episode which went horribly wrong. \"My cover story also means that if someone finds out I'm castrated they view me as a victim, or a brave stalwart rather than a deviant or psychotic person,\" he explains. As well as resurrecting the libido, testosterone prevents osteoporosis and reduces the flab that castration causes to the hips and breasts. (On the down side, it also increases the risk of prostate cancer.)</p> <p>A self-confessed mother hen, Gelding has for four years been dispensing advice on his website to men who want, or think they want, to be castrated. In that time he's had 5,000 enquiries from both gay and straight men, all believing that their obsession is unique. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Russell Reid, of Hillingdon Hospital in west London, identifies castration fixation as \"highly disturbed behaviour, in mainly gay men, whose self-hatred is directed towards their genitals\".</p> <p>Gelding's response to this interpretation is equivocal. \"Yes, it's true that no normal person would do that, but then given that homosexuality has always been called a sickness, what's normal?\" Reid's experience of this tender topic is predominantly with transsexuals (some of whom even castrate themselves) as well as with men who are hypersexed. \"These men are led by their erect penises and some are driven to offend. Being castrated can be a huge release because they become pre-pubital, and sex is no longer an overwhelming preoccupation.\"</p> <p>He finds the origins of the fixation perplexing but speculates that it might be a case of the fear of castration turned on its head to become a uncontrollable craving.</p> <p>But eunuchs are nothing new. For 4,000 years they have represented some of the most marginalised and most honoured in society. In ancient India, eunuchs advised princes and guarded their harems, and the Biblical Daniel was a eunuch who rose to become prime minister of Babylon and later Persia. More recently there have been the Italian castrati of the 19th century - boys who sacrificed their manhood for the sake of singing careers in the opera houses of Europe. Today there are the cross-dressing Hijras in India and religious extremists such as members of the Russian Skoptsy sect who see the testicles as an organ of weakness. The medical profession understands this \"syndrome\" only in relation to transgender reassignment surgery or as part of body dysmorphia (a syndrome in which people become fixated with having a limb amputated). But Gelding disregards the connection with the body modification scene, believing the desire to be castrated is far more complex.</p> <p>Nor can he relate to the transgendered, \"some of whom get castrated just to get on to a gender reassignment programme\". He is also reluctant to help those whose desire to be castrated hinges on the ritual of cutting: \"Because if that's the overriding issue then most of these people are into fantasy and role play and don't have a true fixation.\" When castration is a true fixation, Gelding believes it is vital that surgeons treat the problem in a much more educated fashion. \"There isn't a doctor in the world informed in this area, because nothing will justify to a physician the removal of healthy tissue.\"</p> <p>There are several doctors in the US who will surgically remove testicles, but seldom before getting their patients to sign a consent form saying it is for gender reassignment. Dr Felix Spector, who advertises castration on his business card, has become something of a celebrity in the murky world of eunochdom, having performed his first castration in 1957. But the vast majority are amateur cutters, subject to prosecution for practising medicine without a licence, and desperately sought after on the net by men in urgent need.</p> <p>Although these cutters offer a necessary service (reducing the instance of self-castration), for the most part they too find the act of cutting erotic. Talking about doing a DIY castration, one cutter described the \"lovely crunching sound\" a Burdizzo (a castration device) makes \"like biting into fresh celery\". Burdizzos, elastators and other animal castration devices can all be purchased on the net. The internet has become a sanctuary to these would-be eunuchs. There are numerous websites providing information, and chat lines link men from all over the world who share this compulsion.</p> <p>When Gelding was delivering himself into the hands of the cutter there were no such support services and perhaps that's why it wasn't until he was in his 40s that he finally did what he had always wanted to do. Since then, he says, he has found some kind of inner peace, but at a price. He would have preferred to have been one of those who rationalised their way out of it, something he encourages all his correspondents to do. He considers those who manage it to be the lucky ones.</p> <p>The others must join him among one of the most disenfranchised of groups. Men who are ridiculed, despised and misunderstood by a society which will never be able to make any sense of why they feel incomplete with their testicles and yet complete without them.</p> <p>\u0095 Hidden Love: Modern Day Eunuchs is on Channel 4 next Tuesday at 10pm</p>",

He is also reluctant to help those whose desire to be castrated hinges on the ritual of cutting: \"Because if that's the overriding issue then most of these people are into fantasy and role play and don't have a true fixation.\" When castration is a true fixation, Gelding believes it is vital that surgeons treat the problem in a much more educated fashion. \"There isn't a doctor in the world informed in this area, because nothing will justify to a physician the removal of healthy tissue.\" There are several doctors in the US who will surgically remove testicles, but seldom before getting their patients to sign a consent form saying it is for gender reassignment. Dr Felix Spector, who advertises castration on his business card, has become something of a celebrity in the murky world of eunochdom, having performed his first castration in 1957. But the vast majority are amateur cutters, subject to prosecution for practising medicine without a licence, and desperately sought after on the net by men in urgent need. Although these cutters offer a necessary service (reducing the instance of self-castration), for the most part they too find the act of cutting erotic. Talking about doing a DIY castration, one cutter described the \"lovely crunching sound\" a Burdizzo (a castration device) makes \"like biting into fresh celery\". Burdizzos, elastators and other animal castration devices can all be purchased on the net. The internet has become a sanctuary to these would-be eunuchs. There are numerous websites providing information, and chat lines link men from all over the world who share this compulsion. When Gelding was delivering himself into the hands of the cutter there were no such support services and perhaps that's why it wasn't until he was in his 40s that he finally did what he had always wanted to do. Since then, he says, he has found some kind of inner peace, but at a price. He would have preferred to have been one of those who rationalised their way out of it, something he encourages all his correspondents to do. He considers those who manage it to be the lucky ones. The others must join him among one of the most disenfranchised of groups. Men who are ridiculed, despised and misunderstood by a society which will never be able to make any sense of why they feel incomplete with their testicles and yet complete without them. \u0095 Hidden Love: Modern Day Eunuchs is on Channel 4 next Tuesday at 10pm",

We certainly haven't recognised the extraordinary act of generosity that has been reconciliation in South Africa, and the many sacrifices and dreams deferred for ordinary black people in our land.</p> <p>Now, Hope accepts that racism lives. Yet he skips over racism as an issue not worth much discussion. He trivialises racism by focusing on commissions, who in his eyes seek \"subliminal\" racism as a way to brand enemies. But the question of subliminal racism - like \"institutional racism\" - is complex and real, does express a range of connections and processes that still help to shut black people out and ensure an unequalled standard of life and wealth for whites in South Africa. There are a whole host of aspects of our lives and institutions that we still must change. It's not all about witch-hunts, which is what Hope claims.</p> <p>Hope claims figures are simply manipulated for political purposes: \"Rape is widespread. Well then, let us declare it unpatriotic to talk about it. Road fatalities are shockingly high - let us no longer give them out,\" he cites as evidence.</p> <p>Well, I did a cursory web search. On September 5 the minister of transport told parliament there were 9,068 people killed in 511,605 road accidents in the last year. Jackie Loffell of Johannesburg Child Welfare Society gave shocking statistics on child rape and crime against children, using police statistics, to her annual conference on September 6. At a seminar in Pretoria on August 14, Statistics SA released its study on rape, commissioned by the president, where the annual figure of 68 rapes per 100,000 of population was discussed. The Medical Research Council said it could be 10 times higher, Dr Chris de Kock of the police's crime information analysis centre delivered a paper and another police official gave details of court referrals. Even the British Home Office was represented there.</p> <p>Was Hope's work suppressed on the (new) South African Broadcasting Corporation? It is possible. The SABC's newly appointed chief Vincent Maphai has himself called for steps to right the wrongs of recent excess, and heads have rolled. But the SABC is not the government.</p> <p>In fact, in his bid to prove his point, Hope uses two other examples of authoritarian views. Both sound ominous, but they are actually letters by ordinary citizens to newspapers. Hope may not like what they say, but there's room to contest! He simply had to write a reply and send it in to the newspapers. The debate is robust: no more wild applause just because you once opposed apartheid; just arguments that anyone and everyone can propose.</p> <p>This is not a sign of a government gone mad but of a country learning to talk to itself. One of the great things about South Africa is precisely that everything is up for discussion, everyone has views. Debate is intense and hard, and nothing like the fear-inspired, apparatchik-dominated silence that Hope seems to face.</p> <p>Hope thinks the government sees a secret cabal leading a racist conspiracy. The problem is in a way the reverse: Hope thinks every criticism of ideas must be a conspiracy by government. When the government replies to Cosatu (the union federation), it must be repressing debate - yet surely Cosatu's attacks on macroeconomic policy (recently backed up by the Sangoco coalition of non-governmental organisations working in the development field) are precisely a sign that there is not the \"deeply unhealthy respect for authority\" that Hope fears. In an odd way, even the trouble President Mbeki has got into over HIV/Aids is partly through a stubborn defence of the right of the so-called Aids dissidents to sit on a panel and be heard.</p> <p>When Hope couldn't get on to SABC radio, there were a host of other radio stations to try. He could even do what I did, which was to debate the London correspondent RW Johnson's rightwing views on the popular Tim Modise talk show; earlier a London paper had continually refused to publish my replies.</p> <p>Yes, Christopher, much has changed. I, who was called a terrorist yesterday, represent my country today. But I have a burning desire never to let the same old things happen. In my position, I also have the privilege of meeting the best young people my land has to offer. They see no contradiction between being patriotic and being critical.</p> <p>So, Christopher, continue to speak out at what you think is wrong. I'll join you on that. But I cannot recognise the picture you paint. Please don't call me repressive for saying you're wrong.</p> <p>\u0095 Graeme Bloch is a former chief of social development in South Africa's department of welfare and the husband of the South African high commissioner in Britain</p>",

There are a whole host of aspects of our lives and institutions that we still must change. It's not all about witch-hunts, which is what Hope claims. Hope claims figures are simply manipulated for political purposes: \"Rape is widespread. Well then, let us declare it unpatriotic to talk about it. Road fatalities are shockingly high - let us no longer give them out,\" he cites as evidence. Well, I did a cursory web search. On September 5 the minister of transport told parliament there were 9,068 people killed in 511,605 road accidents in the last year. Jackie Loffell of Johannesburg Child Welfare Society gave shocking statistics on child rape and crime against children, using police statistics, to her annual conference on September 6. At a seminar in Pretoria on August 14, Statistics SA released its study on rape, commissioned by the president, where the annual figure of 68 rapes per 100,000 of population was discussed. The Medical Research Council said it could be 10 times higher, Dr Chris de Kock of the police's crime information analysis centre delivered a paper and another police official gave details of court referrals. Even the British Home Office was represented there. Was Hope's work suppressed on the (new) South African Broadcasting Corporation? It is possible. The SABC's newly appointed chief Vincent Maphai has himself called for steps to right the wrongs of recent excess, and heads have rolled. But the SABC is not the government. In fact, in his bid to prove his point, Hope uses two other examples of authoritarian views. Both sound ominous, but they are actually letters by ordinary citizens to newspapers. Hope may not like what they say, but there's room to contest! He simply had to write a reply and send it in to the newspapers. The debate is robust: no more wild applause just because you once opposed apartheid; just arguments that anyone and everyone can propose. This is not a sign of a government gone mad but of a country learning to talk to itself. One of the great things about South Africa is precisely that everything is up for discussion, everyone has views. Debate is intense and hard, and nothing like the fear-inspired, apparatchik-dominated silence that Hope seems to face. Hope thinks the government sees a secret cabal leading a racist conspiracy. The problem is in a way the reverse: Hope thinks every criticism of ideas must be a conspiracy by government. When the government replies to Cosatu (the union federation), it must be repressing debate - yet surely Cosatu's attacks on macroeconomic policy (recently backed up by the Sangoco coalition of non-governmental organisations working in the development field) are precisely a sign that there is not the \"deeply unhealthy respect for authority\" that Hope fears. In an odd way, even the trouble President Mbeki has got into over HIV/Aids is partly through a stubborn defence of the right of the so-called Aids dissidents to sit on a panel and be heard. When Hope couldn't get on to SABC radio, there were a host of other radio stations to try. He could even do what I did, which was to debate the London correspondent RW Johnson's rightwing views on the popular Tim Modise talk show; earlier a London paper had continually refused to publish my replies. Yes, Christopher, much has changed. I, who was called a terrorist yesterday, represent my country today. But I have a burning desire never to let the same old things happen. In my position, I also have the privilege of meeting the best young people my land has to offer. They see no contradiction between being patriotic and being critical. So, Christopher, continue to speak out at what you think is wrong. I'll join you on that. But I cannot recognise the picture you paint. Please don't call me repressive for saying you're wrong. \u0095 Graeme Bloch is a former chief of social development in South Africa's department of welfare and the husband of the South African high commissioner in Britain",

Mr Hammond made the point that over a lifetime female doctors work fewer hours than their male colleagues. This is a statement of fact which in no way reflects the quality of these women.</p> <p>Without committed women doctors, who now account for over 50% of medical school graduates, the NHS would grind to a halt. The need for women to have maternity leave and flexible working practices is not unique to the NHS. A shift needs to be seen in the context of a reduction in junior doctors' hours and the the call for increased accountability of doctors to the public to ensure safe and high standards of medical care. Hence replacing our stressed and overworked NHS staff with men and women working more sensible hours and living more balanced lifestyles may improve the standard of medical practice. Politicians need to be aware that a substantial increase in the number of doctors will be needed.</p> <p>The Royal College of Physicians is reviewing the data on women in medicine to ensure that female doctors have equal opportunities in all branches of medicine and that the working environment is flexible enough that excellent and highly skilled women are maintained in the NHS.</p> <p><b>Prof Carol Black, <br>Dr Rebecca Fitzgerald</b><br> Royal College of Physicians</p>",

Mr Hammond made the point that over a lifetime female doctors work fewer hours than their male colleagues. This is a statement of fact which in no way reflects the quality of these women. Without committed women doctors, who now account for over 50% of medical school graduates, the NHS would grind to a halt. The need for women to have maternity leave and flexible working practices is not unique to the NHS. A shift needs to be seen in the context of a reduction in junior doctors' hours and the the call for increased accountability of doctors to the public to ensure safe and high standards of medical care. Hence replacing our stressed and overworked NHS staff with men and women working more sensible hours and living more balanced lifestyles may improve the standard of medical practice. Politicians need to be aware that a substantial increase in the number of doctors will be needed. The Royal College of Physicians is reviewing the data on women in medicine to ensure that female doctors have equal opportunities in all branches of medicine and that the working environment is flexible enough that excellent and highly skilled women are maintained in the NHS. Prof Carol Black, Dr Rebecca Fitzgerald Royal College of Physicians",

I agree. Only a fool would suggest that today's writers do not read their Shakespeare and their Ibsen.</p> <p>Our plea to leave off the classics for a while was not aimed at writers but at producers and critics. It was an attempt to open up debate about theatre's reliance on revivals and the audience's fears about new work. When Mr Billington says we should \"overcome our prejudices and widen the area of choice\", I couldn't agree more. But Michael, we cannot do this by maintaining a status quo which has allowed the word theatre to develop deeply negative and old-fashioned connotations in the eyes of young people who nightly pack the cinemas to see new films.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 In his review of Somerset Maugham's The Circle (Reviews, October 12), Michael Billington hit back at mine and Mike Bradwell's suggestion that we ban classics from subsidised theatre (Bite back, G2, October 11) by saying he can think of \"a few dramatists who might learn how to harmonise plot and character\" from studying Maugham's play. I agree. Only a fool would suggest that today's writers do not read their Shakespeare and their Ibsen. Our plea to leave off the classics for a while was not aimed at writers but at producers and critics. It was an attempt to open up debate about theatre's reliance on revivals and the audience's fears about new work. When Mr Billington says we should \"overcome our prejudices and widen the area of choice\", I couldn't agree more. But Michael, we cannot do this by maintaining a status quo which has allowed the word theatre to develop deeply negative and old-fashioned connotations in the eyes of young people who nightly pack the cinemas to see new films. I want the next generation to love plays as much as I do and not think of them simply as something that their parents went to. Tim Fountain Literary manager, Bush Theatre \u0095 Is Brian Watkins (Letters, October 12) suggesting that one needs to write a play before one can pass comment on a writer? What a bizarre thought. No non-chefs to write critiques of restaurants, no sportswriters who have not won more medals than the players they assess, no Film 2000 presenters who haven't directed an Oscarwinning film? We don't teach playwriting here ... Sorry. John Freeman De Montfort University",

      "bodyText": "It was as the artist for the Eagle comic's Adventures Of PC 49 in the 1950s that John Worsley, who has died aged 81, really reached an audience. From his first episode, published in August 1951, he drew the tales of 49 - Archibald Berkeley-Willoughby - until March 1957. Some 290 episodes, involving more than 3,000 drawings, appeared in Eagle comic alone, with further tales in the Eagle Annual and various spin-off books.

He adopted a cautious and contrite approach - excessively so, some commentators thought after the debate.</p> <p>He apologised for getting \"some of the details wrong\" in the first debate. \"I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong,\" Mr Gore said. \"But I will promise you this ... that I will do my best if I'm elected president. I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.\"</p> <p>Mr Bush, while cautious, appeared less chastened. \"My case to the American people is if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse, the horse that's up there now,\" he said in some characteristically folksy closing remarks.</p> <p>With foreign policy issues currently dominating the news agenda, even in the US, the Republican candidate had been intensively tutored for a series of international questions, with which he seemed markedly more at ease than on earlier occasions.</p> <p>In fact, most of the first half of the debate was marked by polite agreement on a succession of issues, in particular foreign policy. Their responses mostly converged on issues such as the Middle East, the Balkans and international trade, although they sparred after Mr Bush insisted that \"nation building\" should not be a US foreign-policy objective.</p> <p>Things got more confrontational, however, when domestic issues took the stage, especially when Mr Gore challenged Mr Bush for his record as the governor of Texas. He appeared to be carefully laying the foundation for a more aggressive onslaught in the coming days by accusing Mr Bush of neglecting issues such as healthcare and the environment.</p> <p>\"I know we have some disagreements on this, and I'm sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here, and Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in healthcare - in children with healthcare, in women with healthcare - and 50th for families with healthcare,\" Mr Gore said.</p> <p>\"If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong,\" Mr Bush responded. \"The facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured as a percentage of our population.\"</p> <p>The last of this year's three presidential debates takes place next Tuesday in Missouri, one of the most hard-fought battleground states in this year's election.</p> <p>Voters go to the polls on November 7.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Al Gore and George W Bush acted as the image-conscious modern politicians they are and made risk avoidance their priority in Wednesday's second debate by US presidential contenders. In an encounter notable for its civil tone, both men opted for the low-key, conversational style that television viewers prefer, and which is likely to leave Mr Bush holding on to a narrow lead in the polls as the race for the White House enters the home stretch. Most political commentators scored the second of this year's three debates, which took place in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as a draw: Mr Gore concentrated on avoiding the hectoring tone of last week's first debate; Mr Bush focused on appearing in command of the issues. A series of instant surveys of the viewing audience suggested that Mr Bush made the better impression, but if reactions to the first debate in Boston are any guide, it will be some days before the overall impact is clear. Mr Gore went into the debate after having his worst week on the campaign trail since the phase before the party conventions in August. He adopted a cautious and contrite approach - excessively so, some commentators thought after the debate. He apologised for getting \"some of the details wrong\" in the first debate. \"I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong,\" Mr Gore said. \"But I will promise you this ... that I will do my best if I'm elected president. I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.\" Mr Bush, while cautious, appeared less chastened. \"My case to the American people is if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse, the horse that's up there now,\" he said in some characteristically folksy closing remarks. With foreign policy issues currently dominating the news agenda, even in the US, the Republican candidate had been intensively tutored for a series of international questions, with which he seemed markedly more at ease than on earlier occasions. In fact, most of the first half of the debate was marked by polite agreement on a succession of issues, in particular foreign policy. Their responses mostly converged on issues such as the Middle East, the Balkans and international trade, although they sparred after Mr Bush insisted that \"nation building\" should not be a US foreign-policy objective. Things got more confrontational, however, when domestic issues took the stage, especially when Mr Gore challenged Mr Bush for his record as the governor of Texas. He appeared to be carefully laying the foundation for a more aggressive onslaught in the coming days by accusing Mr Bush of neglecting issues such as healthcare and the environment. \"I know we have some disagreements on this, and I'm sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here, and Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in healthcare - in children with healthcare, in women with healthcare - and 50th for families with healthcare,\" Mr Gore said. \"If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong,\" Mr Bush responded. \"The facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured as a percentage of our population.\" The last of this year's three presidential debates takes place next Tuesday in Missouri, one of the most hard-fought battleground states in this year's election. Voters go to the polls on November 7.",

But it was not until his presence was exposed in the media and an international warrant for his arrest was issued by the tribunal that he was detained. Mr Muvunyi was in charge of operations for the Rwandese armed forces in Butare and Gikongoro in April and May 1994 when the Hutu militias, backed by the police, started to slaughter Tutsis. Among the allegations against him is that he directed the murder of 65,000 people in a Runyinya commune on a single day, April 21. African Rights, a London-based human rights group, claims that there are more than 100 people, including soldiers and local government officials, who are ready to testify.

Joji Ohara, 48, who reportedly has a penchant for expensive cars and foreign women, was apprehended at a flat in Akasaka, central Tokyo. He is believed to have been a customer at the Casablanca hostess bar, where Ms Blackman, a former British Airways stewardess, was working until she went missing on July 1. Detectives have yet to make a statement, but Japanese media reports said a call made by Ms Blackman on the day she disappeared had been traced to Mr Ohara's mobile phone. The 22-year-old from Sevenoaks, Kent, had called a friend to say a customer was taking her to the seaside. Mr Ohara has been detained on suspicion of indecently assaulting a Canadian hostess between three and four years ago. He allegedly took the woman to a property in Zushi, in Kanagawa Prefecture, and then molested her after getting her drunk. Police believe there may be similarities between the two cases. By investigating the earlier alleged assault, they can hold Mr Ohara for four weeks, while they try to gather evidence on his suspected links with Ms Blackman. Detectives raided about 20 locations nationwide linked to Mr Ohara, who has denied the charges against him. At Mr Ohara's home in an upmarket residential area of Denenchofu, south-western Tokyo, police combed the building and began digging up the garden, which is surrounded by high walls and guarded with security cameras. \"I can't believe he would be involved in something like this,\" said a neighbour, who has known Mr Ohara for 30 years. \"He was always very polite - a regular Japanese businessman.\" Other neighbours, however, said the suspect was a mysterious figure who had not been seen at the property for several months. Mr Ohara is the son of a wealthy Osaka family. He is a law graduate of the elite Keio University and spent three years studying in the United States. His business and private lives, however, are a con fusion of false names and dummy addresses. According to Japanese media reports, Mr Ohara was a regular visitor to foreign hostess bars in Roppongi - which include the Casablanca - where he would run up large tabs under false names. The owner of one bar, interviewed by TV Asahi, said: \"He was a quiet type who never joined in with karaoke or dancing. He was a bit odd.\" At the Casablanca, which has changed its name to the Green Grass, an employee denied that anyone called Ohara had ever been a customer. Mr Ohara is registered as the president of Plant, an estate agency in Akasaka, Tokyo, but he is also the company's sole employee and his \"office\" is a flat in a housing complex.

One of their number, former secretary Lars Gyllesten, has even produced an expos\u00e9 of stitch-ups, cronyism and, allegedly, the hounding to death of the 1974 winner Harry Martinson, who eventually committed hara-kiri with a pair of scissors at a Stockholm clinic. </p> <p>In fact, claims of this sort have been made at many times over the past half-century: throughout the 80s one sometimes imagined that the \"Graham Greene excluded again\" headlines were kept permanently set in type by British newspapers.

To look back over the winners of the past 60 years or so is to turn up half-a-dozen laureates who won for reasons that had little to do with literary merit. John Galsworthy and Pearl S Buck, quintessential middlebrow talents, received the prize in 1932 and 1938 respectively. Sir Winston Churchill won in 1953, presumably for services to world democracy. Even with writers of the stature of Alexander Solzhenitsyn (1970), there is a suspicion that the prize was rewarding dissidence rather than genius. </p> <p>In very bad years, the academy's choice has boiled down to a kind of United Nations-inspired gesturing, picking some language or nation not previously represented, or deserving of exposure, and seeing what can be fixed.

This process wasn't without its ironies. Previously held at arms' length by an Arab establishment suspicious of his western leanings and dubious moral teachings, Mahfouz suddenly found himself being put on postage stamps and having his slightest utterance decoded by vigilant diplomats. Even his presence at a reading given by some Syrian poets at around this time was quickly marked down as a sign of a thaw in Egyptian/Syrian relations. </p> <p>Gratifyingly, though, this kind of globe-trawling often turns up thoroughly deserving winners, whose works go on to win an appreciative international readership. Mahfouz, whose Cairo trilogy (published to huge acclaim in the UK in the early 90s) has been compared to Dickens, is an obvious example. Equally, no one could argue that Kenzaburo Oe (1994) or Jos\u00e9 Saramago (1998) weren't enormously significant (though in the UK insufficiently known) figures for whom a Nobel prize provided a final, validating boost. </p> <p>Inevitably, the public monument status that necessarily accompanies the laureateship seldom does much for a writer's career.
