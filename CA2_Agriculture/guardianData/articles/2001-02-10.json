      "body": "<p>Carved turns have been used by ski-racers for decades as the most efficient way of getting through racecourses. But in the mid-90s, the introduction of curvier-shaped \"carving skis\" made <strong> carving</strong> accessible to all. Nowadays, \"carving skis\" are simply known as \"skis\" - because they're the only kind that are available. </p> <p>Of course, it was always possible to carve turns with the old \"straight skis\", but it required huge leg strength to generate the enormous pressure necessary to bend them into the right curved shape for carving. This shape was called \"reverse camber\". Now, when one of the modern, hourglass-shaped skis is tilted over on to its edge, there is a large gap between the ground and the ski, just under the binding. Then, all the skier needs to do is to gently pressurise the ski by standing on it; the gap will close, and the ski will bend easily into reverse camber. </p> <p>There are many benefits for non-racing skiers who learn to carve. First and foremost, it's more fun! A carved turn will glide you around a corner without any loss of speed, whereas a skidded turn (the opposite of carving) will always slow you down. Secondly, a carved turn can increase your efficiency in getting around the mountain: if you're facing a sharp turn followed by a long flat, a carved turn will help you to carry more speed and cut down on skating and poling. Thirdly, a carving ski is much more stable than a skidding one, and will slice its way across icy patches like a train on rails. </p> <p>The best introduction to carving is to traverse across the hill, with your downhill ski well tilted on to its uphill edge, and with your upper body leaning well out over that downhill ski. A wide stance will help with this exercise. As you set off, your downhill ski will track along its edge, and start to carve uphill - if you can manage this, congratulations! You have already performed part of a carved turn. The next exercise, still working in a traverse across the hill, is to try alternating between sideslipping down the hill and carving across it. This will teach you how to go intentionally from skidding to carving (and vice versa). </p> <p>Soon, you'll be ready to carve an entire turn. You must choose extremely flat terrain for this, because a carved turn will not kill off any of your speed. Just tilt your outside ski on to its edge, lean out over it with your upper body, and set off. You must be patient and wait for the ski to carve around of its own accord. The most common mistake is to try to pivot the ski around with your foot. Once you've managed one of these basic carved turns (known as <strong> \"railroad turns\" </strong> ), you can try to make the transition into the next turn by shifting your weight across on to the other ski and tilting it. </p> <p>As you start to carve railroad turns at a reasonable speed, you must keep a wide stance by keeping your outside leg extended away, out from under your body. If you allow your outside foot to get pushed in, so it's directly below your body, you may lose your balance and topple outwards, as centrifugal force tries to push your body towards the outside of the turn. As you keep that outside leg extended out at an angle, keep your hips dropped towards the inside of the turn, while the upper body remains upright. This is called <strong> \"hip angulation\" </strong>, and will put you in a strong position to resist that centrifugal force. Your outside leg should be fairly straight, with just a slight bend at the knee, so that you can use knee angulation to fine-tune your turns. (Hip angulation pro vides the power; knee angulation provides the control.) </p> <p>Hip angulation will be easier to achieve if you keep your shoulders turned slightly away from the direction you're turning (<strong> \"counter-rotation\" </strong>). If you turn your shoulders in the same direction as you're turning your skis (\"rotation\"), strong hip angulation, and good carving, will be impossible. </p> <p>At first, you'll probably find that your inside ski is just resting flat against the snow, with only 10-20% of your weight on it, acting as a \"stabiliser\". But as you gain confidence, you'll learn to edge the inside ski to the same angle of tilt as the outside ski. The inside leg will always have to be much more bent than the outside leg, and as you go around a turn, you'll learn how to \"soften the outside leg\" and bend it even further, allowing your hips to drop even closer to the ground. This is necessary in each turn, because the forces that you are trying to resist do not stay constant around the turn; in fact, they build up during the turn, reaching a maximum as you finish off the turn, cutting sharply across the hill. </p> <p>To make the transition into the next turn, you need to utilise the springiness of your ski, to shoot your feet across, under your body, so that your legs end up extended out to the other side. In an instant, the new outside ski will bite and start to carve, and the new turn will be under way. </p> <p>Carving becomes easier as you go faster, because your skis will respond quicker. But novice carvers should begin on flatter terrain and at lower speeds, before building up gradually, always taking care to maintain the correct body positions. </p> <p>\u0095 Martin Bell is running ski courses for intermediate skiers this season in Vail &amp; Breckenridge, Colorado.

      "body": "<p>We flew to Mexico City via Madrid, which meant that my boarding pass bore the evocative legend \"MAD MEX\". I took this to be a good omen. </p> <p>Why Mexico? Every few seasons, a designer needs fresh ideas. For me, ideas are usually sparked off by researching a particular person or by travelling. </p> <p>When I choose a person, I like to investigate their sense of style and character. When it's a place, I like to see how the local culture uses colour and imagery. In choosing Mexico, I hoped to combine both my fascination with the painter Frida Kahlo and my love of colour. </p> <p>Frida Kahlo was a Jewish Mexican who believed she imbibed her Mexican Indian nature from her wet nurse. A beautiful woman with complicated hairstyles and a monobrow, her small paintings are essays in magic realism and personal pain. The Tracey Emin of her day, Frida's work reveals almost much too much about her. She was married to the famous painter, Diego Rivera. They were both communists, and Frida had an affair with Trotsky when he visited Mexico. </p> <p>The first place we went to was Frida's house in Coyoa-can, a pretty suburb of Mexico City. We were immediately struck by its colour, a bright blue like Yves St Laurent's house in Marrakech. It has a wonderful kitchen, decorated in yellow and blue with a tiled range. Frida had a playful decorative sense, but was not at all bourgeois, most items being very simple. </p> <p>The best collection of her paintings is in the Delores Olmeda Museum in the Xochimilco area. Delores was a wealthy patron and lover of Diego. It is like a home in a Gabriel Garcia Marques novel, four-sided around a courtyard with its own chapel. Magenta bougainvillea is tangled around the trees and the place is full of small schoolchildren on cultural outings and peacocks strutting across perfectly-tended lawns. </p> <p>Frida and Diego worked in two studios in the San Angel area, decorated in blue and pink, respectively, with a glazed bridge connecting the top floors. Frida's building is strangely bereft of anything but a few family photos, but Diego's has a collection of huge Day of the Dead papier-mch\u00e9 skeletons and sinister dolls. </p> <p>But Mexico City is not somewhere to spend much time, being both highly polluted and dangerous. A sign in our hotel, the wonderfully 60s Camino Real, warned us only to use taxis recommended by the hotel. </p> <p>We flew off to the state of Chiapas, to a small town called San Cristobal de Las Casas, the centre of a series of villages of indigenous people of Mayan origin, the Tzotzils and Tzeltals. </p> <p>Our hotel was the colonial-style Casa Mexicana, which featured a central glazed courtyard housing a tropical garden and fountains. The beams in the main room were festooned with Day of the Dead tissue-paper cuts. </p> <p>San Cristobal has a daily craft market where the villagers come to sell brilliantly striped blankets, hand-embroidered place mats and tablecloths, hand woven runners and embroidered huipiles. The women and children are dressed in fantastic colours. Each village has its own style. </p> <p>On Sunday at the fruit and vegetable market, the produce is carefully-arranged in pyramids, like offerings to a deity. We were amazed at the men's costumes - pink woven tunics embroidered with brightly-coloured flowers and animals and magical symbols. </p> <p>There is a very special place in San Cristobal called Na Bolom, once the home of a Danish couple Trudy and Frans Blom, now a museum and a centre for aiding the Lacandon and other indigenous groups who live in the jungle in eastern Chiapas. Frans was an archaeologist who dug at Mayan sites, while Trudy studied, photographed and worked tirelessly to protect the Lacan don people. Diego and Frida often visited them for boozy holidays, and the bottles they drank then are now used to edge the garden borders. </p> <p>Na Bolom contains a tree nursery, a library of anthropological and archaeological books and a medical wing for treating Lacandon people. It is also a good place to find guides who can organise tours. Ours was called Pepem. A Tzotzil whose parents died when he was a child, he was brought up in Na Bolom by Trudy and taught to speak Spanish and English. He took us to the villages of San Juan Chamula and San Nicholas. </p> <p>In Chamula, in preparation for the Day of the Dead, the graves in the churchyard had all been dug over and the crosses repainted in colours appropriate to the person buried there. Sadly, many were sky blue, the colour for young men. Pepem told us that many Chamulans die young through alcohol poisoning. </p> <p>The saints in the church are dressed in local costumes. At some point, the local shaman decided that Coca-Cola was holy because the burps it induced helped to expel evil spirits from the body. In church, people were swigging from huge bottles of Coke while they prayed. Fresh pine needles were strewn on the floor and strong incense was burning. Smoking is also permitted in church, as is the consumption of \"posh\" a strong locally distilled drink made from sugar cane. </p> <p>The church in Chamula has broken with the Catholic church and now has its own religion. The arch over the front door is painted to resemble a rainbow, the Mayan symbol of entry to the afterlife. Mayans believe that Sun, Moon and Earth correspond with body, blood and \"vegetable\" parts of a human. The vegetable part is hair, which they save whenever it is cut because they believe they will only be allowed into heaven with all the hair they have ever grown. We noticed how carefully the women style their hair, interweaving colourful ribbons into their plaits and often finishing them off with tassles, a practice that Frida copied. </p> <p>San Nicholas is a wealthier area with a fertile valley farmed on a communal basis. The mother of a family we met was weaving on a back-strap loom. Her daughters were all embroidering complicated designs on to white cotton. The father and son weren't engaged in this because it's viewed as women's work, the men's time being spent working the land. </p> <p>Our last stop was Oaxaca, pronounced \"Wahaka\", where the build-up to the Day of the Dead begins in early October and culminates in a two-day festival on November 1 and 2. </p> <p>The origins of the Day lie in a pre-Christian festival when the souls of dead relatives would be lured back to life by offerings. Death is laughed at as the Mexicans dance and images of skeletons engage in the activities of the living. One grave had a model skeleton playing music. The man beside it told us it was the grave of his grandfather who had been a musician. </p> <p>The feeling in the cemeteries is generally one of celebration. People play guitars, sing songs and drink mezcal. Of course, if the deceased is a child, the occasion is much sadder, and the sight of a toy plastic truck and some biscuits on a grave tended by a young couple was very poignant. </p> <p>All homes have shrines where the favourite food and drink of the dead person are laid out. These shrines and the graves are decorated with masses of marigolds and deep pink coxcombs. </p> <p>Markets sell little sugar skulls decorated with sequins and coloured icing, and Day of the Dead bread - big sugary loaves with depictions of tiny saints' heads in the dough. </p> <p>Every niche in the four outer walls of the main city cemetery contained a candle, lit in memory of a dead person, even though some had died more than a hundred years ago.

      "bodyText": "We flew to Mexico City via Madrid, which meant that my boarding pass bore the evocative legend \"MAD MEX\". I took this to be a good omen. Why Mexico? Every few seasons, a designer needs fresh ideas. For me, ideas are usually sparked off by researching a particular person or by travelling. When I choose a person, I like to investigate their sense of style and character. When it's a place, I like to see how the local culture uses colour and imagery. In choosing Mexico, I hoped to combine both my fascination with the painter Frida Kahlo and my love of colour. Frida Kahlo was a Jewish Mexican who believed she imbibed her Mexican Indian nature from her wet nurse. A beautiful woman with complicated hairstyles and a monobrow, her small paintings are essays in magic realism and personal pain. The Tracey Emin of her day, Frida's work reveals almost much too much about her. She was married to the famous painter, Diego Rivera.

      "body": "<p>It happened sometime after midnight on December 31 - after the food had run out, but while the wine and the rum were still bubbling over the bar, probably around the time that the salsa band finally took off into orbit and the whole room went with it in one collective dance of perspiration - just around then, I fell in love. </p> <p>I would have fallen for her in any place at any time, but this night was special in several ways. This was not just New Year's Eve, it was Millennium Eve. While the rest of the world had held its millenial celebrations 12 months earlier, Cuba had held on in a symbol of its proud isolation, preferring to wait until the arithmetically correct deadline, December 31 2000, before letting rip. </p> <p>Futhermore, this was Havana where, on any evening, it is alarmingly easy to feel romantic. Cubans look happy, act happy, and that's catching. They have also created the most sexually liberated culture I have ever come across. The hedonistic atmosphere is helped by the warm climate and the natural beauty of the island. This is a country the size of England, with a population only as big as London, surrounded by long, clean beaches with nothing but palm trees and hammocks for company. </p> <p>In terms of the architecture, the buildings may be crumbling, but they have a charm that is unlikely to fade. The particular building where I first met her, was steeped in grandeur. It felt almost like a trespass to go in through the heavy wooden door from the street, into the deep, dark hallway (dark because it was night, and there seemed to be no electricity on the ground floor) and to gaze up at the remnants of old wealth. </p> <p>The tall stone pillars and the ornate carvings were just visible around the ceiling. I climbed the dusty, narrow staircase, ducking down through several tiny doorways; up past the dim yellow light of cramped apartments, where Cuban families sat with their TVs; across a roof space, to the upper floor, through a heavy double door, into a place like magic. Here, there were three or four interconnecting rooms with dark wooden tables, all lit by dozens of wax-encrusted candles, the walls covered with paintings and old photographs and an antique wooden clock and theatrical masks. The air was filled with the sound of gentle, romantic music. </p> <p>They call this place La Guarida. The Cuban intelligentsia know it well, if only because Tomas Gutierrez Alea, the most creative of Cuban film directors, shot scenes for his Fresa y Chocolate (Strawberry and Chocolate) here in 1993. Hardly anytourists know of the bar's existence unless they observe the first rule of travel in Cuba: burn the guidebook and, instead, trust the locals to show you the way. </p> <p>That's another part of the romance of the place - the improvisation... chaos would be a better word. By the time, the sun finally rose and rescued Havana from riot, I had found love in La Guarida but I had lost my jacket, my passport, my brother, two English friends and four Swedes, all of whom had disappeared into the night. You have to go with the flow. Time-servers and knee-benders should stay away. People go to Cuba and fall in love with it (or, indeed, with each other) because it's a place of self-indulgence, and constantly fascinating. </p> <p>I promise you that you will never encounter a place of so many riddles and paradoxes - there is considerable personal poverty, yet there is a striking absence of crime; this is a one-party state and yet voter turn-out is three times as high as, for example, the United States; it is a society born out of violence but with one of the most pacific populations in the world; a country which has been corrupted, exploited, invaded and sabotaged by the US but which chooses the American dollar as its currency. Indeed, the whole business of the relationship with the US is one mighty paradox. </p> <p>Here is the Land of the Free supposedly protesting Cuban infringement of human rights, such as the right to travel, by infringing the human rights of its own citizens to visit or trade with the island. Here is the most powerful capitalist nation in history refusing to supply goods and services to a society whose primary reason for existence is to avoid capitalism in the first place. </p> <p>Millennium night at La Guarida was full of its own riddles. The owner, Enrique, stepped into the candlelight to explain that this was not a meal. This was an artistic experiment - an attempt to recreate a scene from Fresa y Chocolate in which the two central characters eat a five-course feast (itself based on a meal described by the great Cuban poet Jose Lezama Lima in his 1966 novel, Paradiso), the premise being that all who eat become great thinkers and writers. </p> <p>It took three hours and some of it was truly strange - fried banana soup with popcorn croutons; seafood souffle; asparagus and beetroot; turkey and yucca, plantain and rice; coconut ice cream in half a pineapple. And, all the time, the wine kept coming, and then the rum and, at some point on the way through, the gentle classical music gave way to live salsa, and then it was midnight and, outside in the streets, there was the sound of mighty splashing as all the Cubans threw open their windows and washed away the bad spirits of the old year by chucking buckets of water into the air. Then we pushed back the tables, the salsa band went wild, and the singer was like a monkey - muscular and primitive and sexual in every tiny movement - and the music was loud and frantic. It was one of those times when everyone in the room is all part of the same dance - it got hotter and faster and wetter and wilder and, for a split second, the crowd of dancers parted and there she was, and I reached out for her and... who wouldn't have fallen in love? </p> <p>She should not even have been there. She was American, and, under the terms of the US Trading with the Enemy Act, American citizens can be fined up to $250,000 and jailed for up to 10 years for spending a single dollar in Castro's country. She had come in under the wire, through Mexico. Somehow, that made her even more romantic. By the time I realised I had lost my passport, we were a perfect couple - she in trouble with the US, me with Cuba (I'd lost my visa as well as the passport). A match made in Havana. Go with the flow. </p> <p>Sometime close to dawn, we drifted back to my hotel. More riddles. If she had been Cuban, they would not have let her in: a society that fought a two-year guerrilla war for the right to its national self-esteem now bans its own people from numerous tourist facilities and areas. </p> <p>Perhaps the bigger paradox here is the most familiar one in world tourism: that travellers visit places because they are different only for their presence to erode the very difference that attracted them. For example, people go to Havana for the salsa bands. And yet the horrible truth is that some of the bands in central Havana are now starting to play songs such as Yesterday, by the Beatles, and a version of Frank Sinatra's My Way and some Muzak version of that Paul Simon song about how he'd rather be a tortoise than a snail - and they are doing it to please us. </p> <p>Even worse, if you ask Cubans where to go for salsa, there are some (the ones who have most contact with tourists, like hotel staff and taxi drivers) who will direct you to posh hotels where they stage nauseating \"international spectacular\" floor shows - lots of women with high-cut outfits and pink feathers in their hair, lurching around like stoned swans and grinning like skulls. </p> <p>But all is not lost. Real Cuba is still there - you just have to push a little to find it. One good example: there is an extraordinary alley in central Havana that has been taken over by a brilliant artist, Salvador Gonzales. He has painted the whole place with wonderful murals and strange epigrams, based on the old religions that were imported to Cuba by slaves from West Africa. He has a gallery there and, once a week (currently on Sundays, but it could change) Cuban musicians meet there to boogie. Salvador is usually there, and he likes to talk (and to sell paintings). It's worth going, but my guidebook failed to put the street on any of its maps, got the name of the street wrong, indicated the general location of the street and got that wrong, too. (See panel for the best directions you'll get.) </p> <p>Sometime the next day, my brother returned with my jacket and my passport and his own strange tale of adventure; and one of the Swedes I had lost, who works in the music industry, went back to La Guarida and gave the salsa band a recording contract. Go with the flow. That's Cuba. That's romance. </p> <p><strong>Salsa, disco, and where they mix a mean mojito</strong></p> <p><strong> Drinking</strong></p> <p>In old Havana, head for two parallel streets, Obispo and O'Reilly, and, among a dozen good bars, look for Lluvia de Oro, Cafe Paris and O'Reilly's. All have live bands - the one at Caf\u00e9 Paris is currently the best. One more street across, in Empedraco, is La Bodeguita del Medio - expensive but surprisingly unspoiled considering it is the place where Hemingway drank his daily dozen mojitos (rum with sugar, limejuice and mint) and is, therefore, on every single tour route. For quiet contemplation, go to the Inglaterra Hotel in Parque Centrale and watch the chaos on the streets from the refuge of the terrace. If you sit at the southern end, you will get your drink much quicker.</p> <p><strong> Dancing</strong></p> <p>Salsa in the bars. Alternatively the discos with mostly Western music are a taxi ride away from old Havana, and most of them are awash with young Cubans, looking for excitement and also for dollars. None of them gets going until after 10pm. The disco at the Commodoro Hotel is currently the biggest and busiest. Also, try Johnnie's, at Ave Primera and Calle Zero, also known as Bar Uno. If you insist on seeing floor shows, they are in most of the posh hotels, particularly the Riviera and the Melia Cohiba. Outside the hotels, the most expensive is the Tropicana ($60); the cheapest is the Cabaret Nacional next to the Inglaterra. </p> <p><strong>Eating</strong></p> <p>Cuba is not famous for good food. The best fun is to explore the paladares, private houses licensed to sell meals. For a dollar, any hustler on the street will take you to one. You don't have to stay - some are great, some are best forgotten. The greatest and most magical is La Guarida, so magical that it is tempting to protect it by withholding its address... but here goes: Calle Concordia 418. You can phone for a reservation on 637351. Aries near the university at Ave 27 de Noviembre 27, no 456, is another good spot. Los Amigos, Ave M and Calle 19, is quick, clean, reliable. Escorpion, down the road at Ave M and Calle 17, is quick and clean and worth visiting if only for the soap opera sounds of the Cuban family just upstairs. </p> <p><strong>Sleeping</strong></p> <p>The cheapest and most interesting option is to use a casa particular, a private house licensed to rent out rooms. Look for signs and for a blue triangle on the door, or follow the hustlers. Expect to pay no more than $25 a night. Check that the hot and cold water are working. If you use an unlicensed place and anything is stolen, you may have trouble getting a police report for your insurance claim. There are comfortable hotels in old Havana, but a lot of rooms suffer from 24-hour street noise. The Inglaterra is the most characterful, but it is badly run and suffers from lots of internal noise along its marble corridors as well as the street sounds. The Plaza has quiet rooms on an inner courtyard, but the rest are noisy. The Sevilla has the best swimming pool (if you look like you own it, you can walk in and use it even if you are not staying there). The Cientifica is cheap, characterful but dowdy.</p> <p><strong>Special places</strong></p> <p>Museo de la Revolucion, a couple of blocks north from Parque Centrale: collection of artefacts and records of more than a century of Cuban nationalist struggle.</p> <p>Museo Jose Marti, inside the Marti monument on Plaza de la Revolucion - the dedicated life and early death of the father of Cuban nationalism. Almost entirely in Spanish, very clearly laid out.</p> <p>Callejon de Hamel - the elaborately painted alleyway home of the renowned Cuban artist, Salvador Gonzales.

      "bodyText": "It happened sometime after midnight on December 31 - after the food had run out, but while the wine and the rum were still bubbling over the bar, probably around the time that the salsa band finally took off into orbit and the whole room went with it in one collective dance of perspiration - just around then, I fell in love. I would have fallen for her in any place at any time, but this night was special in several ways. This was not just New Year's Eve, it was Millennium Eve. While the rest of the world had held its millenial celebrations 12 months earlier, Cuba had held on in a symbol of its proud isolation, preferring to wait until the arithmetically correct deadline, December 31 2000, before letting rip. Futhermore, this was Havana where, on any evening, it is alarmingly easy to feel romantic. Cubans look happy, act happy, and that's catching. They have also created the most sexually liberated culture I have ever come across. The hedonistic atmosphere is helped by the warm climate and the natural beauty of the island. This is a country the size of England, with a population only as big as London, surrounded by long, clean beaches with nothing but palm trees and hammocks for company. In terms of the architecture, the buildings may be crumbling, but they have a charm that is unlikely to fade. The particular building where I first met her, was steeped in grandeur. It felt almost like a trespass to go in through the heavy wooden door from the street, into the deep, dark hallway (dark because it was night, and there seemed to be no electricity on the ground floor) and to gaze up at the remnants of old wealth. The tall stone pillars and the ornate carvings were just visible around the ceiling. I climbed the dusty, narrow staircase, ducking down through several tiny doorways; up past the dim yellow light of cramped apartments, where Cuban families sat with their TVs; across a roof space, to the upper floor, through a heavy double door, into a place like magic. Here, there were three or four interconnecting rooms with dark wooden tables, all lit by dozens of wax-encrusted candles, the walls covered with paintings and old photographs and an antique wooden clock and theatrical masks. The air was filled with the sound of gentle, romantic music. They call this place La Guarida. The Cuban intelligentsia know it well, if only because Tomas Gutierrez Alea, the most creative of Cuban film directors, shot scenes for his Fresa y Chocolate (Strawberry and Chocolate) here in 1993. Hardly anytourists know of the bar's existence unless they observe the first rule of travel in Cuba: burn the guidebook and, instead, trust the locals to show you the way. That's another part of the romance of the place - the improvisation... chaos would be a better word. By the time, the sun finally rose and rescued Havana from riot, I had found love in La Guarida but I had lost my jacket, my passport, my brother, two English friends and four Swedes, all of whom had disappeared into the night. You have to go with the flow. Time-servers and knee-benders should stay away. People go to Cuba and fall in love with it (or, indeed, with each other) because it's a place of self-indulgence, and constantly fascinating. I promise you that you will never encounter a place of so many riddles and paradoxes - there is considerable personal poverty, yet there is a striking absence of crime; this is a one-party state and yet voter turn-out is three times as high as, for example, the United States; it is a society born out of violence but with one of the most pacific populations in the world; a country which has been corrupted, exploited, invaded and sabotaged by the US but which chooses the American dollar as its currency. Indeed, the whole business of the relationship with the US is one mighty paradox. Here is the Land of the Free supposedly protesting Cuban infringement of human rights, such as the right to travel, by infringing the human rights of its own citizens to visit or trade with the island. Here is the most powerful capitalist nation in history refusing to supply goods and services to a society whose primary reason for existence is to avoid capitalism in the first place. Millennium night at La Guarida was full of its own riddles. The owner, Enrique, stepped into the candlelight to explain that this was not a meal. This was an artistic experiment - an attempt to recreate a scene from Fresa y Chocolate in which the two central characters eat a five-course feast (itself based on a meal described by the great Cuban poet Jose Lezama Lima in his 1966 novel, Paradiso), the premise being that all who eat become great thinkers and writers. It took three hours and some of it was truly strange - fried banana soup with popcorn croutons; seafood souffle; asparagus and beetroot; turkey and yucca, plantain and rice; coconut ice cream in half a pineapple. And, all the time, the wine kept coming, and then the rum and, at some point on the way through, the gentle classical music gave way to live salsa, and then it was midnight and, outside in the streets, there was the sound of mighty splashing as all the Cubans threw open their windows and washed away the bad spirits of the old year by chucking buckets of water into the air. Then we pushed back the tables, the salsa band went wild, and the singer was like a monkey - muscular and primitive and sexual in every tiny movement - and the music was loud and frantic. It was one of those times when everyone in the room is all part of the same dance - it got hotter and faster and wetter and wilder and, for a split second, the crowd of dancers parted and there she was, and I reached out for her and... who wouldn't have fallen in love? She should not even have been there. She was American, and, under the terms of the US Trading with the Enemy Act, American citizens can be fined up to $250,000 and jailed for up to 10 years for spending a single dollar in Castro's country. She had come in under the wire, through Mexico. Somehow, that made her even more romantic. By the time I realised I had lost my passport, we were a perfect couple - she in trouble with the US, me with Cuba (I'd lost my visa as well as the passport). A match made in Havana. Go with the flow. Sometime close to dawn, we drifted back to my hotel. More riddles.

      "body": "<p>If you walk on a midwinter evening up the ancient grass avenue leading to Stonehenge, you sometimes see a blood-red sun sinking to the horizon between two of the tallest stones. \"It's very spooky,\" says Julian Richards. \"It looks like a beating heart slowly dropping out of sight. </p> <p>He thinks the midwinter solstice probably saw the most important ceremonies. \"It marks the turning of the year, the shortest day: from now on, the days will get longer and spring will follow. You talk to the gods, and light can return.\" </p> <p>The walk up the Avenue is the finale of his favourite four-mile circuit of the area, best done in winter when low light and a touch of frost or snow emphasise the lumps and bumps that an archaeologist looks for. </p> <p>Most visitors allow an hour and just see the stones, he says. But it's much more rewarding to give it four - then you can tour the rim of the natural amphitheatre, exploring the burial mounds and looking back at the sarsens, or large sandstones, and their place in the landscape. </p> <p>\"If you look around from the henge, on every skyline there is a group of barrows,\" says Richards. \"You appreciate the stones more when you see them from a distance. It brings you closer to the lives of the people who built this place over 1,500 years.\" </p> <p>His Stonehenge winter walk takes him from the car park to the dramatic cluster of barrows at the western end of the Cursus, a ditched enclosure 3km long and 100m wide.

He thinks the midwinter solstice probably saw the most important ceremonies. \"It marks the turning of the year, the shortest day: from now on, the days will get longer and spring will follow. You talk to the gods, and light can return.\" The walk up the Avenue is the finale of his favourite four-mile circuit of the area, best done in winter when low light and a touch of frost or snow emphasise the lumps and bumps that an archaeologist looks for. Most visitors allow an hour and just see the stones, he says. But it's much more rewarding to give it four - then you can tour the rim of the natural amphitheatre, exploring the burial mounds and looking back at the sarsens, or large sandstones, and their place in the landscape. \"If you look around from the henge, on every skyline there is a group of barrows,\" says Richards. \"You appreciate the stones more when you see them from a distance. It brings you closer to the lives of the people who built this place over 1,500 years.\" His Stonehenge winter walk takes him from the car park to the dramatic cluster of barrows at the western end of the Cursus, a ditched enclosure 3km long and 100m wide.

You may also have to juggle the demands of doing two jobs at the same time. </p> <p>According to Ben Williams, the trick is to prioritise. \"For most people, the problem is differentiating between what's urgent, but not important and what's important, but not urgent.

You've just graduated from high school, what will you do now? I'm not going to go to college for a while, I'm going to carry on acting. I just got my first million dollar offer, which is exciting. It's outrageous. Who would pay me a million dollars to do what I do?",

And then there it was on the menu of Sukiyaki for all to see: sukiyaki: \"Scotch beef sirloin and fresh vegetables cooked and served at your table.\" She conceded with far more grace than I would have been able to muster had the situation been reversed. But it is hard to be ungracious after lunch somewhere as nice as Sukiyaki. </p> <p>St Albans is not the first place you might think of looking for a decent Japanese restaurant. Mind you, if you listened to Costanza, the connoisseur of 80s pop, and The Gunner, her immensely civilised husband, you would have thought that there aren't any decent restaurants in St Albans at all - and they should know: they live there. This seems a little odd, seeing that St Albans has more than its fair share of millionaires and media hounds. </p> <p>Anyway, I came across the name of Sukiyaki while browsing through the info Michelin sent along when the new guide came out recently. They had awarded it a red M, or whatever sign they use these days to signify good food at reasonable prices, and, after weeks of cutting-edge cooking and gastro-pubs, I fancied something by way of a change. Perhaps my friends can be forgiven being unaware of this little gem on their doorstep: Sukiyaki has been on Spencer Street for six years, it seems, without anyone getting terribly excited about it. But for a restaurant to survive that long anywhere is a sign that it is doing most things right. </p> <p>The menu, which is helpfully laid out along western lines with starters and main courses, isn't exactly packed with ground- breaking stuff. Aside from the eponymous sukiyaki, there's a bit of teriyaki, a tonkatsu dish or two, and tempura, naturally, among the main courses; and yakitori, agedashi dofu and kushikatsu among the starters. Each dish is accompanied by a short, sensible explanation of what it is, so there is no need to worry about displaying embarrassing ignorance. Nor is there anything of the raw fish, braised jellyfish colon or deep- fried cocks-combs variety. This is Japanese food for beginners, and jolly good it is, too. </p> <p>For it doesn't matter how sophisticated food is. What matters is how it is cooked and served. Both my companions were not only novices in matters of tempura and tonkatsu, but ardent vegetarians as well. No problem. The prawns were happily dropped from the roster of tempura moriawase, and replaced instead with a generous supply of further veg in an alpha-double-plus batter, light and friable. Before that, agedashi dofu - deep-fried bean curd - in a sauce bouncing with ginger, mirin, soya and seaweed stock, and a classic miso soup had provided a gentle entry, with rice and pickles to provide bulk and counterpoint. </p> <p>The pickles were an item. There was a time - perhaps there still is - when a bride's way with pickles defined her negotiating strength in the marriage contract in certain countries in the Far East. On the basis of the pickles we had, the pickler in the kitchen at Sukiyaki could command her or his own price. They were delicate, poised, lightly acid little coils of vivid green cucumber and deep purple radish. </p> <p>In relation to my own set of dishes - gyoza dumplings and buta shoga (thin slices of pork in a ginger sauce) - perfect foils to burnish the tastebuds between each mouthful. The pastry on the dumpling was refined, the stuffing perky with aromatics. The slices of pork of the buta shoga were like folds of linen, bathed in a mirin-sweetened sauce to which ginger added a cheerful warmth. The miso soup had an unusual degree of bloom and depth. </p> <p>The point that I kept coming back to was how clean and fresh it all tasted. Do you want more? Occasionally, yes, but this will do me very nicely on a regular basis, thank you. And, at \u00a38.50 for my set lunch, I should be able to afford it. </p> <p>In fact, the huge total for the three of us was \u00a349.35, and that included \u00a35.40 on beer, \u00a33 on sake and \u00a32.30 on wine.

For more than a decade cinema-goers have been reassured by a statement at the end of films that \"no animals were harmed in the making of this film\", but now a newspaper has criticised the organisation responsible for monitoring animal welfare on set. The film and TV unit of the American Humane Association (AHA), which is based in Los Angeles, observes some 850 productions a year and reckons to cover 80 to 90% of all US films that use animals. On the unit's website, ahafilm.com, around 90% of the productions are listed as \"acceptable.\" But the unit has only nine full-time field staff and operates with a budget of around $1.5m (\u00a31m). The Los Angeles Times claims this has led to the unit being slow to criticise animal mistreatment but swift to defend the big studios. AHA lawyers tried in vain to prevent the publication of the Times investigation on the grounds that it used information from a confidential report into claims that an AHA investigator had dated two trainers whose work she was assigned to oversee. She was criticised in the report for a \"gross lack of professional judgment\".

Cold kills more than 80,000 people a year through heart attacks and other circulation problems. Scientists expected this to drop by 15,000 by 2020, and another 5,000 by 2050. The milder winters would also cut the annual steep rise in hospital admissions that so disrupts the NHS each year. </p> <p>Less certain were the health effects of the heavy rain, flooding and storms that were expected to become a feature of the British climate. </p> <p>In Scotland, this was expected to lead to increased damp in houses causing winter ailments, and milder winters and more standing water offering breeding grounds for clouds of midges. This would make life unpleasant and damage the tourist industry. </p> <p>It was the expected early arrival of malaria that most exercised Liam Donaldson, the government's chief medical officer, yesterday. </p> <p>He said it likely to involve the milder form of the disease, plasmodium vivax, which did not often kill but frequently recurred. </p> <p>More than 2,000 cases of traveller's malaria were reported each year, and more than two-thirds of these were life threatening. </p> <p>The vast majority of victims had been on holiday abroad, but there had been about 60 cases recorded of people living near airports who had been bitten by a stray mosquito arriving on board an aircraft. </p> <p>Mosquitoes able to carry malaria have always existed in Britain, and the disease was endemic between the 16th and 19th centuries. David Rogers, a professor at Oxford University, said malaria was the disease referred to as ague by Shakespeare. It had died out in the 19th century because of better housing (partly because man stopped living close to farm animals), and draining of marshes. </p> <p>The last outbreak in England was in Kent when troops returning from the first world war with malaria were bitten by local mosquitoes that spread the disease to people who had never left England. </p> <p>A similar return from abroad of humans with malaria was how the disease was expected to be reintroduced, and it could occur at any time during the warm summer months. </p> <p>Salt water marshes were most likely to breed malaria mosquitoes. The Norfolk fens, the Thames estuary, parts of south-east Kent, and the Somerset levels, where the disease thrived in the last century, were the most susceptible. </p> <p>Prof Rogers said there was a danger of the second more deadly form of malaria reaching Britain. </p> <p>Plasmodium falciparum killed 1m children a year in Africa. It was spreading to western Turkey and Mexico and could well be brought to Britain by holidaymakers. </p> <p>Other \"tropical\" diseases like West Nile fever, which has recently killed people in New York, must also be candidates for reaching Britain. It was carried by wild birds and had already infected horses in southern France - showing it could spread to the UK, Prof Donaldson said.</p>",

In Scotland, this was expected to lead to increased damp in houses causing winter ailments, and milder winters and more standing water offering breeding grounds for clouds of midges. This would make life unpleasant and damage the tourist industry. It was the expected early arrival of malaria that most exercised Liam Donaldson, the government's chief medical officer, yesterday. He said it likely to involve the milder form of the disease, plasmodium vivax, which did not often kill but frequently recurred. More than 2,000 cases of traveller's malaria were reported each year, and more than two-thirds of these were life threatening. The vast majority of victims had been on holiday abroad, but there had been about 60 cases recorded of people living near airports who had been bitten by a stray mosquito arriving on board an aircraft. Mosquitoes able to carry malaria have always existed in Britain, and the disease was endemic between the 16th and 19th centuries. David Rogers, a professor at Oxford University, said malaria was the disease referred to as ague by Shakespeare. It had died out in the 19th century because of better housing (partly because man stopped living close to farm animals), and draining of marshes. The last outbreak in England was in Kent when troops returning from the first world war with malaria were bitten by local mosquitoes that spread the disease to people who had never left England. A similar return from abroad of humans with malaria was how the disease was expected to be reintroduced, and it could occur at any time during the warm summer months. Salt water marshes were most likely to breed malaria mosquitoes. The Norfolk fens, the Thames estuary, parts of south-east Kent, and the Somerset levels, where the disease thrived in the last century, were the most susceptible. Prof Rogers said there was a danger of the second more deadly form of malaria reaching Britain. Plasmodium falciparum killed 1m children a year in Africa. It was spreading to western Turkey and Mexico and could well be brought to Britain by holidaymakers. Other \"tropical\" diseases like West Nile fever, which has recently killed people in New York, must also be candidates for reaching Britain. It was carried by wild birds and had already infected horses in southern France - showing it could spread to the UK, Prof Donaldson said.",

Carlton, 930p at its height, was worth 482p, a drop of 48%. </p> <p>United, which reached the \u00a310 mark last summer, at present stands at 770p, a more modest 23% drop, but that gap was in effect bridged as the company gave details of its typically complex plan to return \u00a31.25bn to shareholders - the equivalent of 245p per share. </p> <p>During the heat of the battle last summer to decide which company would emerge as the dominant force in ITV, United appeared decidedly to be the loser. After failing to merge with Carlton, United had little option but to sell out to Granada. </p> <p>During the whole process Lord Hollick, United's chief executive, kept grinning maniacally. He had, he assured us, been the winner out of this. He had wrung fantastic value from the sale of the ITV assets, regardless of that fact that his strategy for the business had been blown out of the water. </p> <p>Now, as the television advertising market softens - and Granada told us by how much it has done so earlier this week - so Lord Hollick seems to have been proved correct. </p> <p>The sale of the ITV assets has been the catalyst for United to do what investors had been demanding for some time - shed the mini-conglomerate tag. United has cleared out the blight of Express Newspapers and is moving toward the sale of its other consumer businesses, leaving a much more focused business to business rump. Commanding \u00a31.75bn for the ITV franchises, he now appears to have sold at the peak.

      "bodyText": "Take a quick glimpse at the share price charts of Granada, Carlton Communications and United Business Media, and it is easy to determine which you would rather have put your money into at this time last year. Granada, which peaked at more than 300p a share, was yesterday worth 190p, a fall of 37%. Carlton, 930p at its height, was worth 482p, a drop of 48%. United, which reached the \u00a310 mark last summer, at present stands at 770p, a more modest 23% drop, but that gap was in effect bridged as the company gave details of its typically complex plan to return \u00a31.25bn to shareholders - the equivalent of 245p per share. During the heat of the battle last summer to decide which company would emerge as the dominant force in ITV, United appeared decidedly to be the loser. After failing to merge with Carlton, United had little option but to sell out to Granada. During the whole process Lord Hollick, United's chief executive, kept grinning maniacally. He had, he assured us, been the winner out of this. He had wrung fantastic value from the sale of the ITV assets, regardless of that fact that his strategy for the business had been blown out of the water. Now, as the television advertising market softens - and Granada told us by how much it has done so earlier this week - so Lord Hollick seems to have been proved correct. The sale of the ITV assets has been the catalyst for United to do what investors had been demanding for some time - shed the mini-conglomerate tag. United has cleared out the blight of Express Newspapers and is moving toward the sale of its other consumer businesses, leaving a much more focused business to business rump. Commanding \u00a31.75bn for the ITV franchises, he now appears to have sold at the peak. Whether that was pure serendipity or shrewd financial management is another matter.

      "body": "<p>British men spend more time away from their children than fathers anywhere else in Europe. But there is no mass movement among UK fathers to win back time out of the labour market; there are no proposals from the government to cut men's working week; and men who want more time off - or women who want men to take time off to play more of a part in parenting and homemaking - have no champions in the government.</p> <p>A promise to \"uphold family life\" as the \"core of society\" was part of New Labour's manifesto at the last election. Since then, home secretary Jack Straw has led a new movement in the cabinet - the married men's movement - enthusiastically supported by his deputy at the home office, Paul Boateng, and by the prime minister himself. They shied away from a proposal for state dowries to entice couples to marry (heterosexual, of course), but the prime minister did set up a ministerial committee on the family, chaired by Straw.</p> <p>Straw made his views clear when he told a Christian group that although \"it is not for the state to put pressure on people to marry\", he believed the government should promote marriage as the best barricade between childhood and a career in crime. Marriage is most likely to provide children with \"two participating parents\". So how much do these cabinet ministers participate in parenting?</p> <p>According to Downing Street, the prime minister \"eats and sleeps the job\". When Paul Boateng was at the department of health, his spokesperson said he \"works all the hours that God gives\". When we asked the home office, a trawl through Straw's diary revealed a six-day-week of several 18-hour days. His shortest working day was 13.5 hours. When Straw delivered his big speech on \"family matters\", he devoted only two paragraphs out of 65 to time. Perhaps the long-hours culture should be challenged, he ventured - but not, it seems, among politicians.</p> <p>We asked a range of people to complete detailed diaries of their daily lives; we wanted to find out how much parenting, and how much paid and unpaid work, men and women do. We also asked them what they thought of these politicians' pronouncements. Darlene Aiken, a nursery supervisor with an 18-year-old son, was dismissive: none of them had anything relevant to say, she said. Helen Hughes, a full-time homemaker with two children, feels that, \"in the politicians' eyes, you are a nonentity - because you are not draining the state of anything, you are not a problem\".</p> <p>Jack Lowe, a photographer and father of a two-year-old son, was unimpressed by the example set by Tony Blair when he finally decided to take paternity leave after his wife's labour. \"He seemed so shocked. How had it passed him by before? It could have helped a lot of dads if he'd decided beforehand to take paternity leave. My job is just as important to me as his is to him.\" Lowe took three weeks' holiday when the baby was born.</p> <p>Jaspal Dhaliwal, a computer consultant, argued, \"The biggest thing that would help parents, single parents and two-parent families is adequate childcare. We both work full-time and we took a financial hit on childcare - we paid out more than we pay on our mortgage. Equality costs money.\" All of these parents are worried by the amount of time fathers spend away from their families. The past three decades has seen tumult between the genders and generations; women and children have come to expect care and companionship from men. Yet during these decades, men's working time has actually grown.</p> <p>Helen Hughes's husband, Jim, a design engineer, knows that it is his job and travel time that keeps him from his wife and children: \"I get up before the children and when I get home they're on their last legs.\" Before his children started school, he worked a 12-hour day. Sometimes, he worked six months without a day off. Now, he works an average week. Doing the diary made him think \"how little time I spend with my kids. When I get met at the door, it's very nice, it's 'Daddy, Daddy!' But I'd like to get my briefcase down first.\" His wife lives by a different timetable: \"I have the guilt thing,\" she says. \"When he comes home, that's it, the end of his day. But I don't stop till I drop.\"</p> <p>The married men's movement in the cabinet tends to focus on the purported flight of the mothers into the labour market, or on a divorce culture that allegedly leaves boys in a world without men. Implicitly they invoke a \"golden era\" of fathered family life, in the 50s, say, when people left their doors unlocked and the sun always shone and mothers were always at home.</p> <p>This is the Rupert Bear template with Father giving Rupert his full attention and providing a proper model of masculinity. But there was no golden age: the 50s father spent an average of only 11 minutes a day caring for his little ones. These days he spends 44 minutes a day caring for his pre-school child, according to Professor Jonathon Gershuny, Britain's premier expert on domestic time.</p> <p>In those olden days, fatherhood was about being a provider rather than a parent, it was about absence and authority over women and children. Is it the loss of that distant power that the men's movement really laments? Contemporary children who live with their dads probably enjoy more congenial fathering than at any time in modern history.</p> <p>Gershuny's research on the use of time in everyday life reveals that mothers in full-time work actually spend more dedicated time caring for their pre-school children than the full-time homemakers of the 50s: an average 107 minutes a day, compared with 20 minutes four decades ago. This is no surprise to baby-boomers who lived their childhood in the golden era. Mothers may have been a permanent presence in the home, but \"being there\" did not always mean \"being with\" their children. \"Go out and play,\" they told their kids. The street was their space. It is not parents so much as cars that have rendered that theatre of childhood a dangerous place. In any case, today's school-age children of professional parents are increasingly away from their homes and streets: they're often at school and children's clubs from 8.30am until 6.30pm.</p> <p>Research commissioned by the Childcare Commission was not designed to ask men how much childcare and housework they do. But these themes dominate the disagreements between men and women. According to counselling service Relate, \"The most common cause of housework arguments is the amount men do.\" According to Gershuny, when women go out into the labour market, men scarcely increase their share of the domestic work. And so, because men have not taken over responsibility for domestic work, women's overall working time (paid and unpaid) gets longer and longer.</p> <p>Contrary to the expectation that domestic work will decline, it is increasing: not only do parents expect to spend more time with their children, but some domestic activities, far from fading away, are being recalibrated from \"labour\" to \"leisure\". There is, for example, a revolution in British cuisine. \"For the great majority of us, employed or not, cooking for our own households often seems the only genuinely productive thing we get to do,\" comments Gershuny. Women, he notes, however anxious to shed domestic work, will still cook. \"House cleaning,\" comments Gershuny, \"is mere maintenance,\" which perhaps explains why women still perform three-quarters of it even when they, like the men they live with, have full-time jobs outside the home.</p> <p>Contrary to conventional wisdom, younger men do less than the average, and their contribution to core domestic work, according to Gershuny, \"hardly changes with the presence of children\". In fact, his use of time-use diaries confounds several myths. True, his research suggests that men spend an average of 28 minutes a day on domestic work compared with women's 177 minutes, but both genders spend more time than they used to alone with their children of all ages. For women, the figure is about 10 hours a week, twice as much as men, according to Legal &amp; General, whose interest in mothers' work - both paid and unpaid - concerns its worth. If a mother dies and has to be replaced, what would she cost? Legal &amp; General reckons the average mother's unwaged work would cost more than \u00a3200 a week to replace.</p> <p>The government, however, retains the view that work is only work if it is paid for in the labour market. That's why it landed itself in trouble, and not only with women's groups, when it insisted that single mothers should \"work\" - as if they weren't already working.</p> <p>Despite its confidence about state intervention in morals and marriage, our government recoils from tackling the big issue - the redistribution of time and money between the genders. It was 70s feminism that began the debate. Alarmed by the exhausting effects of entering the labour market on the same terms as male breadwinners who had wives at home to take care of them and their children, some proposed an alternative politics of time: the part-time woman worker should be regarded as the norm. She has no one to service her; she simultaneously takes care of herself and others. This model proposes a reduced working week for everyone tailored to synchronise with children's time, and a dramatic rise in child benefit to erase the residual excuses for unequal pay between men and women.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, this strategy was an affront to the traditions of the labour market. For a century, both employers and trade unions had bargained for a male breadwinner: a man paid a family wage and serviced by an unpaid woman.</p> <p>Defenders of the patriarchal family and the family wage, notably the Thatcherite Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and the social democratic Institute of Community Studies (ICS), promote men's privileged place in the economy - and thus their estrangement from everyday responsibilities in the home - on the grounds that women are better at it, and that if men are expected to be women's equals, they'll skive, or worse, they'll skiddaddle. When it comes to domestic democracy, these political enemies unite.</p> <p>Geoff Dench, at the ICS, takes the pessimistic position shared by the IEA: men won't pay the price of parenting unless they are given a privileged place in the economy and in the home. If they are expected to be equal and they are liberated by free love, they'll do even less.</p> <p>A third approach has been proposed by Amitai Etzioni, the American sociologist and leader of communitarianism. Etzioni was promoted in Britain by Demos director Geoff Mulgan who advises Straw's ministerial group on the family; Etzioni is a proponent of the theory of the \"parenting deficit\", which argues that the family is falling apart because of the divorce culture and because women are doing what men do, fleeing the nest, going out to work and abandoning children to the drinks cupboard and the television.</p> <p>Evidence shows, however, that divorce merely means that women are leaving men, not their children. Nevertheless, Etzioni is popular among those seeking evidence for their apocalyptic angst about families falling apart, about community and crime.</p> <p>A glance at Britain's time-use and employment statistics shows that men and women live in different time zones. Even when they're at home, they're doing different things, and mothers' entry into employment is still contingent on taking care of everyone. Britain's labour market is polarised between full-time men and part-time mothers.</p> <p>Gershuny reckons that the government's family agenda is not only \"grossly old-fashioned\" but also \"unacceptable\", because it does not deal with the deficit between men and women. Despite the dramatic rise in women's paid work, men's domestic work - stable at around 30 minutes a day - hardly changes. Gershuny detects a long-term gender convergence between men and women. Demos imagines that we are almost there. It argues that corporate culture and men are being feminised and that women are being masculinised.</p> <p>But are the genders converging? Among our diarists, no one recognised this. Cleaner and community activist Sue Rickus said, \"To be honest, the woman still goes out to work, sees to the children, while the men go out to work, come home and that's that. No, men and women aren't getting more alike. If only!\"</p> <p>Kath Webb, who lives with Jack Lowe and toddler Callum, agreed. \"We have quite a modern relationship, but Jack is a breadwinner and I am a full-time housewife. His job is his job. My job is looking after Callum.\" Even when they are at home together, they do different things - she always cooks, he always clears up.</p> <p>The premier researcher on time and gender in the US, Arlie Hochschild, argues that something else is happening. Although the genders are changing and the pressure towards equality is coming from women, the genders may still be living different lives. Hochschild is an academic in California, where the divorce rate is 60%. \"Divorce has utterly different consequences for men and women. It reasserts the gender divide.\" After divorce, women do even more everyday childcare (as well as everything else). They often do all of it - in Britain, 40% of divorced men lose all contact with their children. According to Hochschild, divorce has become a \"central fact of marital life that is leading to gender differences\". Men and women may become simultaneously more alike and more estranged. Western women may find themselves preferring motherhood supported by the sisterhood of friends and relatives than a precarious alliance with a father.</p> <p>She does not see a parenting deficit among fathers and mothers so much as a \"care deficit\" caused by the withdrawal of the welfare state, particularly in the US and the UK - and the ones who are losing out are children, the elderly, patients recovering from surgery, or schizophrenics abandoned to unwelcoming communities. \"The state has become a deadbeat dad,\" says Hochschild.</p> <p>Nowhere in the world offers an optimistic prognosis. Even in Sweden, the west's model of social solidarity and equality, the provision in the 90s of paid parental leave available for both mothers and fathers to share during children's early years has yielded little change - fathers took up only 11.5% of the paid leave.</p> <p>In Britain, those fathers who strive for a better balance between home and work have no champions other than the women they live with, and certainly none in political society. Yet many men \"have a more advanced and less traditional gender ideology than their lives would suggest\".</p> <p>This is confirmed by our own research: the men were usually amazed at how much more the wom</p> <p><b> Jaspal Dhaliwal, Computer consultant, two children </b><br></p> <p>Sunday <br></p> <p><b>7.45-8.00</b> Woken by children/back to sleep.</p> <p><b> 9.30-10.15</b> Get up/wash/dress.</p> <p><b> 11.30-12.00</b> To sikh temple with my family.</p> <p><b> 12.30-13.00</b> Lunch at temple.</p> <p><b> 13.30-14.00</b> Take children to sister's.</p> <p><b> 14.00-16.15</b> Wash the car/wife's car.</p> <p><b> 16.30-17.00</b> Cup of tea/watch TV.</p> <p><b> 17.15-19.45</b> Parents-in-law/sister and brother/wife arrive/chat.</p> <p><b> 20.00-20.45</b> Read with daughter.</p> <p><b> 21.00</b> Have dinner.</p> <p><b> 22.30</b> Go to bed.</p> <p><b> Monday </b><br></p> <p><b>7.15-8.00</b> Get up/dress/wash.</p> <p><b> 8.00-8.30</b> Breakfast/listen to news.</p> <p><b> 8.30-9.00</b> To work.</p> <p><b> 9.00-9.30</b> Chat/coffee.</p> <p><b> 12.00-12.30</b> Lunch.</p> <p><b> 17.00-18.00</b> Home.</p> <p><b> 19.00-19.30</b> Eat dinner.</p> <p><b> 19.30-20.00</b> To Curry's to exchange child's computer game.

      "bodyText": "British men spend more time away from their children than fathers anywhere else in Europe. But there is no mass movement among UK fathers to win back time out of the labour market; there are no proposals from the government to cut men's working week; and men who want more time off - or women who want men to take time off to play more of a part in parenting and homemaking - have no champions in the government. A promise to \"uphold family life\" as the \"core of society\" was part of New Labour's manifesto at the last election. Since then, home secretary Jack Straw has led a new movement in the cabinet - the married men's movement - enthusiastically supported by his deputy at the home office, Paul Boateng, and by the prime minister himself. They shied away from a proposal for state dowries to entice couples to marry (heterosexual, of course), but the prime minister did set up a ministerial committee on the family, chaired by Straw. Straw made his views clear when he told a Christian group that although \"it is not for the state to put pressure on people to marry\", he believed the government should promote marriage as the best barricade between childhood and a career in crime. Marriage is most likely to provide children with \"two participating parents\". So how much do these cabinet ministers participate in parenting? According to Downing Street, the prime minister \"eats and sleeps the job\". When Paul Boateng was at the department of health, his spokesperson said he \"works all the hours that God gives\". When we asked the home office, a trawl through Straw's diary revealed a six-day-week of several 18-hour days. His shortest working day was 13.5 hours. When Straw delivered his big speech on \"family matters\", he devoted only two paragraphs out of 65 to time. Perhaps the long-hours culture should be challenged, he ventured - but not, it seems, among politicians. We asked a range of people to complete detailed diaries of their daily lives; we wanted to find out how much parenting, and how much paid and unpaid work, men and women do. We also asked them what they thought of these politicians' pronouncements. Darlene Aiken, a nursery supervisor with an 18-year-old son, was dismissive: none of them had anything relevant to say, she said. Helen Hughes, a full-time homemaker with two children, feels that, \"in the politicians' eyes, you are a nonentity - because you are not draining the state of anything, you are not a problem\". Jack Lowe, a photographer and father of a two-year-old son, was unimpressed by the example set by Tony Blair when he finally decided to take paternity leave after his wife's labour. \"He seemed so shocked. How had it passed him by before? It could have helped a lot of dads if he'd decided beforehand to take paternity leave. My job is just as important to me as his is to him.\" Lowe took three weeks' holiday when the baby was born. Jaspal Dhaliwal, a computer consultant, argued, \"The biggest thing that would help parents, single parents and two-parent families is adequate childcare. We both work full-time and we took a financial hit on childcare - we paid out more than we pay on our mortgage. Equality costs money.\" All of these parents are worried by the amount of time fathers spend away from their families. The past three decades has seen tumult between the genders and generations; women and children have come to expect care and companionship from men. Yet during these decades, men's working time has actually grown. Helen Hughes's husband, Jim, a design engineer, knows that it is his job and travel time that keeps him from his wife and children: \"I get up before the children and when I get home they're on their last legs.\" Before his children started school, he worked a 12-hour day. Sometimes, he worked six months without a day off. Now, he works an average week. Doing the diary made him think \"how little time I spend with my kids. When I get met at the door, it's very nice, it's 'Daddy, Daddy!' But I'd like to get my briefcase down first.\" His wife lives by a different timetable: \"I have the guilt thing,\" she says. \"When he comes home, that's it, the end of his day. But I don't stop till I drop.\" The married men's movement in the cabinet tends to focus on the purported flight of the mothers into the labour market, or on a divorce culture that allegedly leaves boys in a world without men. Implicitly they invoke a \"golden era\" of fathered family life, in the 50s, say, when people left their doors unlocked and the sun always shone and mothers were always at home. This is the Rupert Bear template with Father giving Rupert his full attention and providing a proper model of masculinity. But there was no golden age: the 50s father spent an average of only 11 minutes a day caring for his little ones. These days he spends 44 minutes a day caring for his pre-school child, according to Professor Jonathon Gershuny, Britain's premier expert on domestic time. In those olden days, fatherhood was about being a provider rather than a parent, it was about absence and authority over women and children. Is it the loss of that distant power that the men's movement really laments? Contemporary children who live with their dads probably enjoy more congenial fathering than at any time in modern history. Gershuny's research on the use of time in everyday life reveals that mothers in full-time work actually spend more dedicated time caring for their pre-school children than the full-time homemakers of the 50s: an average 107 minutes a day, compared with 20 minutes four decades ago. This is no surprise to baby-boomers who lived their childhood in the golden era. Mothers may have been a permanent presence in the home, but \"being there\" did not always mean \"being with\" their children. \"Go out and play,\" they told their kids. The street was their space. It is not parents so much as cars that have rendered that theatre of childhood a dangerous place. In any case, today's school-age children of professional parents are increasingly away from their homes and streets: they're often at school and children's clubs from 8.30am until 6.30pm. Research commissioned by the Childcare Commission was not designed to ask men how much childcare and housework they do. But these themes dominate the disagreements between men and women. According to counselling service Relate, \"The most common cause of housework arguments is the amount men do.\" According to Gershuny, when women go out into the labour market, men scarcely increase their share of the domestic work. And so, because men have not taken over responsibility for domestic work, women's overall working time (paid and unpaid) gets longer and longer. Contrary to the expectation that domestic work will decline, it is increasing: not only do parents expect to spend more time with their children, but some domestic activities, far from fading away, are being recalibrated from \"labour\" to \"leisure\". There is, for example, a revolution in British cuisine. \"For the great majority of us, employed or not, cooking for our own households often seems the only genuinely productive thing we get to do,\" comments Gershuny. Women, he notes, however anxious to shed domestic work, will still cook. \"House cleaning,\" comments Gershuny, \"is mere maintenance,\" which perhaps explains why women still perform three-quarters of it even when they, like the men they live with, have full-time jobs outside the home. Contrary to conventional wisdom, younger men do less than the average, and their contribution to core domestic work, according to Gershuny, \"hardly changes with the presence of children\". In fact, his use of time-use diaries confounds several myths. True, his research suggests that men spend an average of 28 minutes a day on domestic work compared with women's 177 minutes, but both genders spend more time than they used to alone with their children of all ages. For women, the figure is about 10 hours a week, twice as much as men, according to Legal &amp; General, whose interest in mothers' work - both paid and unpaid - concerns its worth. If a mother dies and has to be replaced, what would she cost? Legal &amp; General reckons the average mother's unwaged work would cost more than \u00a3200 a week to replace. The government, however, retains the view that work is only work if it is paid for in the labour market. That's why it landed itself in trouble, and not only with women's groups, when it insisted that single mothers should \"work\" - as if they weren't already working. Despite its confidence about state intervention in morals and marriage, our government recoils from tackling the big issue - the redistribution of time and money between the genders. It was 70s feminism that began the debate. Alarmed by the exhausting effects of entering the labour market on the same terms as male breadwinners who had wives at home to take care of them and their children, some proposed an alternative politics of time: the part-time woman worker should be regarded as the norm. She has no one to service her; she simultaneously takes care of herself and others. This model proposes a reduced working week for everyone tailored to synchronise with children's time, and a dramatic rise in child benefit to erase the residual excuses for unequal pay between men and women. Not surprisingly, this strategy was an affront to the traditions of the labour market. For a century, both employers and trade unions had bargained for a male breadwinner: a man paid a family wage and serviced by an unpaid woman. Defenders of the patriarchal family and the family wage, notably the Thatcherite Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and the social democratic Institute of Community Studies (ICS), promote men's privileged place in the economy - and thus their estrangement from everyday responsibilities in the home - on the grounds that women are better at it, and that if men are expected to be women's equals, they'll skive, or worse, they'll skiddaddle. When it comes to domestic democracy, these political enemies unite. Geoff Dench, at the ICS, takes the pessimistic position shared by the IEA: men won't pay the price of parenting unless they are given a privileged place in the economy and in the home. If they are expected to be equal and they are liberated by free love, they'll do even less. A third approach has been proposed by Amitai Etzioni, the American sociologist and leader of communitarianism. Etzioni was promoted in Britain by Demos director Geoff Mulgan who advises Straw's ministerial group on the family; Etzioni is a proponent of the theory of the \"parenting deficit\", which argues that the family is falling apart because of the divorce culture and because women are doing what men do, fleeing the nest, going out to work and abandoning children to the drinks cupboard and the television. Evidence shows, however, that divorce merely means that women are leaving men, not their children. Nevertheless, Etzioni is popular among those seeking evidence for their apocalyptic angst about families falling apart, about community and crime. A glance at Britain's time-use and employment statistics shows that men and women live in different time zones. Even when they're at home, they're doing different things, and mothers' entry into employment is still contingent on taking care of everyone. Britain's labour market is polarised between full-time men and part-time mothers. Gershuny reckons that the government's family agenda is not only \"grossly old-fashioned\" but also \"unacceptable\", because it does not deal with the deficit between men and women. Despite the dramatic rise in women's paid work, men's domestic work - stable at around 30 minutes a day - hardly changes. Gershuny detects a long-term gender convergence between men and women. Demos imagines that we are almost there. It argues that corporate culture and men are being feminised and that women are being masculinised. But are the genders converging? Among our diarists, no one recognised this. Cleaner and community activist Sue Rickus said, \"To be honest, the woman still goes out to work, sees to the children, while the men go out to work, come home and that's that. No, men and women aren't getting more alike. If only!\" Kath Webb, who lives with Jack Lowe and toddler Callum, agreed. \"We have quite a modern relationship, but Jack is a breadwinner and I am a full-time housewife. His job is his job. My job is looking after Callum.\" Even when they are at home together, they do different things - she always cooks, he always clears up. The premier researcher on time and gender in the US, Arlie Hochschild, argues that something else is happening. Although the genders are changing and the pressure towards equality is coming from women, the genders may still be living different lives. Hochschild is an academic in California, where the divorce rate is 60%. \"Divorce has utterly different consequences for men and women. It reasserts the gender divide.\" After divorce, women do even more everyday childcare (as well as everything else). They often do all of it - in Britain, 40% of divorced men lose all contact with their children. According to Hochschild, divorce has become a \"central fact of marital life that is leading to gender differences\". Men and women may become simultaneously more alike and more estranged. Western women may find themselves preferring motherhood supported by the sisterhood of friends and relatives than a precarious alliance with a father. She does not see a parenting deficit among fathers and mothers so much as a \"care deficit\" caused by the withdrawal of the welfare state, particularly in the US and the UK - and the ones who are losing out are children, the elderly, patients recovering from surgery, or schizophrenics abandoned to unwelcoming communities. \"The state has become a deadbeat dad,\" says Hochschild. Nowhere in the world offers an optimistic prognosis. Even in Sweden, the west's model of social solidarity and equality, the provision in the 90s of paid parental leave available for both mothers and fathers to share during children's early years has yielded little change - fathers took up only 11.5% of the paid leave. In Britain, those fathers who strive for a better balance between home and work have no champions other than the women they live with, and certainly none in political society. Yet many men \"have a more advanced and less traditional gender ideology than their lives would suggest\".

Comments I learned how full my days are of mundane things, contact with children and other parents, constantly tidying up, making railways and jigsaws and taking them apart.

Comments Doing the diary brought home to me how much my wife actually does. And although we are in the same house, by the time I'm home from work I vegetate, so though we're together, we're not together. Another thing was how little time I spent with my kids. Helen isn't a nag - she knows when I'm in and not to be talked to. When I get met at the door by my kids it's 'Daddy! Daddy!' I'd like them to let me put down my briefcase first. But it's very nice. This has made me realise how hard we both work. Helen works just as hard at home as I do at work, and then she has another job part-time. Sue Rickus, cleaner and community activist with children.

Comments Doing the diary made me realise how much spare time I did not have. All I have is a couple of hours sometimes during the day. To be honest, I often have a sleep. No time for breakfast. I didn't realise how much I did. My husband has recently been made redundant. He's on invalidity. He doesn't move for the first hour. I make him get up. He dresses the baby and dresses himself. My husband makes the kids' meals. I never have time to eat with my family, except at weekends. And I never have time for a meal - I just eat things like crisps and sausage rolls while I'm running around. \u0095 Read the rest of this article here.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Like the other 10 million smartest people in the country, I've been glued to the TV for the past month of Saturday evenings witnessing the joy that is Popstars. But unlike most of the other 10 million - and certainly unlike most of those over the age of 40 featured in the latest Who's Who, I'll wager - I am a hardcore case. </p> <p> Not only do I watch it, but I tape it, watch it over again, make everyone who comes to the door watch it - and then I log on to the Popstars website for a couple of hours of rigorous debate on subjects such as \"MYLEENE AND THE MIXED RACE SHOWBIZ SCHISM\" and \"HAYLEY EVETTS - THE GOD THAT FAILED\". </p> <p> I love Popstars for many reasons - Nigel's Tiller Boy coarseness, Kym's cleavage, the fact that Jim Davidson is on the other side - but one of the main reasons I like it is that, by watching it, I feel that I am striking an active blow against noncy middle-class ideas about \"quality\" television; and, indeed, on a grander international scale, about ideas of creativity and enlightenment. </p> <p> After years of being your run-of-the-mill media ponce who believes that art and culture are necessarily good things and that being able to write a good book is automatically more desirable than knowing how to unblock drains, say, I now find myself growing increasingly impatient with the whole fetid, self-adoring circle jerk that is the creative process. We are supposed to dislike docusoaps on the grounds that they are brain candy, but the words pot and kettle do come very quickly to mind here. Do we really believe that we learn more about the human condition from the latest adaptation of a snooty old Nancy Mitford novel than we do from Big Brother?</p> <p> It is the big lie of the creative industries that \"fiction is a lie which tells us the truth about life\". But it doesn't; it simply tells us how a sex-obsessed old bigot felt in the 50s (Take A Girl Like You) or how a sour old spinster felt in the 18th century (Pride And Prejudice). And then there's the fact that televising a book remains as silly and illogical as miming a sculpture or dancing a painting.

      "bodyText": "Like the other 10 million smartest people in the country, I've been glued to the TV for the past month of Saturday evenings witnessing the joy that is Popstars. But unlike most of the other 10 million - and certainly unlike most of those over the age of 40 featured in the latest Who's Who, I'll wager - I am a hardcore case. Not only do I watch it, but I tape it, watch it over again, make everyone who comes to the door watch it - and then I log on to the Popstars website for a couple of hours of rigorous debate on subjects such as \"MYLEENE AND THE MIXED RACE SHOWBIZ SCHISM\" and \"HAYLEY EVETTS - THE GOD THAT FAILED\". I love Popstars for many reasons - Nigel's Tiller Boy coarseness, Kym's cleavage, the fact that Jim Davidson is on the other side - but one of the main reasons I like it is that, by watching it, I feel that I am striking an active blow against noncy middle-class ideas about \"quality\" television; and, indeed, on a grander international scale, about ideas of creativity and enlightenment. After years of being your run-of-the-mill media ponce who believes that art and culture are necessarily good things and that being able to write a good book is automatically more desirable than knowing how to unblock drains, say, I now find myself growing increasingly impatient with the whole fetid, self-adoring circle jerk that is the creative process. We are supposed to dislike docusoaps on the grounds that they are brain candy, but the words pot and kettle do come very quickly to mind here. Do we really believe that we learn more about the human condition from the latest adaptation of a snooty old Nancy Mitford novel than we do from Big Brother? It is the big lie of the creative industries that \"fiction is a lie which tells us the truth about life\". But it doesn't; it simply tells us how a sex-obsessed old bigot felt in the 50s (Take A Girl Like You) or how a sour old spinster felt in the 18th century (Pride And Prejudice). And then there's the fact that televising a book remains as silly and illogical as miming a sculpture or dancing a painting. (People do, of course, sing plays - we call it opera, posssibly the dumbest thing human beings can do with their clothes on.) Good docusoaps, from The Family to Popstars, take us way beyond their immediate concerns into the realms of the truly profound. Popstars artistically (Myleene playing Coldplay's Trouble over film of the judges going to deliver their final verdicts) and emotionally (Kym's parents!) batters the hell out of fictions about the Muse Biz, be they parochial TV productions such as A Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star or big-budget Hollywood films such as Almost Famous (in which singing along to an, ahem, Elton John song on the tour bus is presented as some sort of epiphany; only if you're Gary Barlow, I'd have thought).

      "byline": "Faisal Bodi",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When Diana, Princess of Wales, died, one of the more fantastic conspiracy theories doing the rounds in Muslim capitals was that she had been bumped off by British intelligence agents defending the Crown from non-Christian designs.</p> <p>Since her consort, Dodi al-Fayed, was a Muslim, went the theory, Diana might convert to Islam to marry him and in doing so predispose her two sons, William and Harry, to the faith. That - shock, horror - would have presented the prospect of a Muslim heir to the throne.</p> <p>Aside from entertainment value, the theory did have one positive effect. Among British Muslims it triggered a lively debate on the place of religion in our constitution. When Muslims talk about constitutional reform we usually mean one thing: disestablishment. But advocates are thin on the ground. Paradoxical as it may sound, most Muslims have so far been content to live under the patronage of an established Church and would be sorry to see it dis-established.</p> <p>Theologically, we have found justification for second-class coexistence in an eighth-century precedent, when a group of persecuted believers from the nascent community fled Arabia to seek refuge in Abyssinia under a benevolent Christian king. That has released us from the religious requirement to uphold the shariah (the divine law) in its entirety, to a position where we ought to uphold as much of it as is legally possible.</p> <p>In practical terms, Muslims have viewed the Church's statutory presence in parliament, and the dual responsibility of the monarch as head of the Church of England and head of state, as a valuable anchor tying Britain to its monotheistic past. For smaller faith groups, the Church's weakness has been a source of strength: a church with little more than symbolic political influence has left them free to get on with their own business.</p> <p>Yet this status quo discourages reform. It locks the Muslim community into a position of disadvantage and second-class status. Look, for example, at the number of Anglican bishops entitled to sit in the Lords. Last year's Wakeham report recognised this privilege, but recommended that it be more evenly spread between the Christian denominations.</p> <p>Eight minority faiths would benefit by sharing five seats on a rotating basis. This would leave the Muslim community barely better off. Although they form the second largest religious community (estimated conservatively at 1-1.5m), they end up with the same allocation as Jews (300,000) and Buddhists (30-130,000).</p> <p>The long hand of the Church extends to other areas of parliament. When they assume office, non-Christian peers and MPs must declare their allegiance to its head. Before each sitting, the sole Muslim MP, Mohammad Sarwar, must listen to the inaugural prayer read out by the sergeant at arms. Upon entering and leaving the House, he must also bow towards the Speaker to honour the altar that stood behind his throne in the days when parliament sat in St Stephen's Chapel.</p> <p>Anglican privilege is also manifested in other areas of life. Two years ago, the government appointed a Muslim adviser to the prison service, the first civil service post dedicated to servicing the needs of the Muslim community. But because the Prison Act does not allow for anyone other than an Anglican chaplain to administer to the spiritual needs of inmates, Maqsood Ahmed has had to be employed by the Chaplaincy Service. So we have the absurd situation whereby the activities of a Muslim chaplain are, in theory, subject to the whims of a Christian chaplaincy.</p> <p>This grace and favour approach sits uneasily alongside the idea of a modern multi-faith democracy. It sidesteps what is actually needed: a root and branch reordering of the relations between faith groups and the state. I am aware that many reformists would rather do away with religion altogether from our political system on the grounds that it, like the monarchy, is a relic that has outlived its usefulness. But that is not the answer, since it would only institutionalise the exclusion of a large and increasing section of society.</p> <p>\u0095 Faisal Bodi is a British Muslim journalist.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Diana, Princess of Wales, died, one of the more fantastic conspiracy theories doing the rounds in Muslim capitals was that she had been bumped off by British intelligence agents defending the Crown from non-Christian designs. Since her consort, Dodi al-Fayed, was a Muslim, went the theory, Diana might convert to Islam to marry him and in doing so predispose her two sons, William and Harry, to the faith. That - shock, horror - would have presented the prospect of a Muslim heir to the throne. Aside from entertainment value, the theory did have one positive effect. Among British Muslims it triggered a lively debate on the place of religion in our constitution. When Muslims talk about constitutional reform we usually mean one thing: disestablishment. But advocates are thin on the ground. Paradoxical as it may sound, most Muslims have so far been content to live under the patronage of an established Church and would be sorry to see it dis-established. Theologically, we have found justification for second-class coexistence in an eighth-century precedent, when a group of persecuted believers from the nascent community fled Arabia to seek refuge in Abyssinia under a benevolent Christian king. That has released us from the religious requirement to uphold the shariah (the divine law) in its entirety, to a position where we ought to uphold as much of it as is legally possible. In practical terms, Muslims have viewed the Church's statutory presence in parliament, and the dual responsibility of the monarch as head of the Church of England and head of state, as a valuable anchor tying Britain to its monotheistic past. For smaller faith groups, the Church's weakness has been a source of strength: a church with little more than symbolic political influence has left them free to get on with their own business. Yet this status quo discourages reform. It locks the Muslim community into a position of disadvantage and second-class status. Look, for example, at the number of Anglican bishops entitled to sit in the Lords. Last year's Wakeham report recognised this privilege, but recommended that it be more evenly spread between the Christian denominations. Eight minority faiths would benefit by sharing five seats on a rotating basis. This would leave the Muslim community barely better off. Although they form the second largest religious community (estimated conservatively at 1-1.5m), they end up with the same allocation as Jews (300,000) and Buddhists (30-130,000). The long hand of the Church extends to other areas of parliament. When they assume office, non-Christian peers and MPs must declare their allegiance to its head. Before each sitting, the sole Muslim MP, Mohammad Sarwar, must listen to the inaugural prayer read out by the sergeant at arms. Upon entering and leaving the House, he must also bow towards the Speaker to honour the altar that stood behind his throne in the days when parliament sat in St Stephen's Chapel. Anglican privilege is also manifested in other areas of life. Two years ago, the government appointed a Muslim adviser to the prison service, the first civil service post dedicated to servicing the needs of the Muslim community. But because the Prison Act does not allow for anyone other than an Anglican chaplain to administer to the spiritual needs of inmates, Maqsood Ahmed has had to be employed by the Chaplaincy Service. So we have the absurd situation whereby the activities of a Muslim chaplain are, in theory, subject to the whims of a Christian chaplaincy. This grace and favour approach sits uneasily alongside the idea of a modern multi-faith democracy. It sidesteps what is actually needed: a root and branch reordering of the relations between faith groups and the state. I am aware that many reformists would rather do away with religion altogether from our political system on the grounds that it, like the monarchy, is a relic that has outlived its usefulness. But that is not the answer, since it would only institutionalise the exclusion of a large and increasing section of society. \u0095 Faisal Bodi is a British Muslim journalist.",

      "bodyText": "Persimmon shareholders might be asking themselves just what they have bought. Yesterday, Beazer, which Persimmon agreed to acquire for \u00a3559m last month, reported an 18% drop in profits in the six months to December 31, blaming weak sales in the summer period. The figures surprised analysts who expected a better performance from Beazer given the good market conditions rival housebuilders have been reporting. Stephen Rawlinson, analyst at Peel Hunt, doubts whether Beazer will now be able to meet profits forecasts for the full year. \"While the company claims that it will be able to meet its objectives to June 2001, we think that they are probably deluding themselves.\" He expects Persimmon shares to remain below the 300p mark because of the Beazer figures. Last night they stood at 282p, after falling 18.5p yesterday. Persimmon shareholders have a chance to vote on the takeover on February 21.",

      "bodyText": "Rightwing death squads have threatened to kill members of an international human rights group which includes British volunteers working in some of the most dangerous regions of Colombia. Paramilitary gunmen have warned members of Peace Brigades International (PBI) that they are now considered a \"military objective\" because of their work with community groups in the northern town of Barrancabermeja. PBI teams - which include British, Canadian and Australian volunteers - provide unarmed escorts for community activists, trade unionists and human rights workers who are often targets of the rightwing militias. Two gunmen burst into the offices of the Popular Women's Organisation (OFP), a local women's group, during a peace demonstration on Wednesday. Identifying themselves as members of Colombia's largest paramilitary group, the United Self-defence Force of Colombia (AUC), they confiscated mobile phones and a passport belonging to a Swedish PBI volunteer. \"From this moment onwards, you are targets,\" they warned. OFP runs soup kitchens for war refugees in Barrancabermeja, an industrial town of 200,000 people which has become a battleground for the warring factions. Once a stronghold of leftwing rebels, the town is now dominated by the paramilitary squads. Guerrillas and paramilitaries rarely confront each other directly, and most of their victims are unarmed civilians accused of collaborating with the other side. Last year the bloody conflict claimed more than 500 lives in Barrancabermeja. Human rights monitors say most killings are the work of the paramilitaries. \"We know that when they make a threat they're not playing around,\" said Yolanda Becerra, an OFP organiser. OFP organisers say that they have been targeted for denouncing paramilitary abuses. \"They are recruiting boys as young as 12 ... they seduce them with \u00a3150, a cellphone and a gun. As women and mothers, we cannot allow this,\" said Ms Becerra. \"The paramilitaries don't understand that a women's group can have an independent political position.

Volunteers have been harassed, mortar-bombed and stabbed, but they are believed to have saved scores of lives. \"We're unarmed, so in terms of protection we depend on the support of the community behind us,\" said a PBI spokeswoman, Emma Eastwood. In Barrancabermeja, nine volunteers provide 24-hour accompaniment for the OFP and other local groups. \"The organisations we accompany have been threatened very seriously over the years and are now threatened on a daily basis,\" said Denise Cauchi, 33, a former journalist and one of four British PBI volunteers in Colombia. \"I wouldn't say you ever get used to [the danger], but there's no time to get carried away by your emotions. There's only time to focus on what you have to do.\" Wednesday's death threat came as President Andres Pastrana met the leader of Colombia's largest rebel group in what many saw as a last-ditch attempt to save the country from all-out war. He travelled to the heart of guerrilla-controlled territory for a two-day meeting with Manuel \"Sureshot\" Marulanda, commander of the 17,000-strong Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). The militias have grown rapidly in recent years, now fielding some 8,000 fighters, and despite government denials, human rights groups say that the militias still receive support from some police and army officers. Farc has refused to make any concessions or declare a ceasefire. Rebels continue to kidnap civilians and attack villages, even though the government has withdrawn police and troops from an area twice the size of Wales, a condition for negotiations.

      "body": "<p>Fame came to Anne Morrow Lindbergh, who has died aged 94, through marriage to the pioneer pilot Charles Lindbergh. He became the world's most celebrated man for making the first solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927. But fame brought her misery, then tragedy, then infamy, only transcended by her own, highly-praised, writing career.</p> <p>She said early on that she wanted to marry \"a hero\" and got her chance on holiday in Mexico City, where her father was US ambassador. It was only seven months after \"Lucky Lindy\" had landed in Paris and Lindbergh was present as a family guest. Anne was immediately struck. Their first date was in an aeroplane, which Charles flew over Long Island. On the second date, he proposed. Anne, who was studying at university and looking forward to a quiet, intellectual life, hesitated for weeks before accepting.</p> <p>She later wrote: \"The man I was to marry believed in me and what I could do, and consequently I found I could do more than I realised, even in that mysterious outer world that fascinated me but seemed unattainable. He opened the door to 'real life,' and though it frightened me, it also beckoned. I had to go.\"</p> <p>Her husband taught her to fly and they made air trips around the world together. She also wrote 13 books, several of them bestsellers, and one, Gift From the Sea in 1955, discussed the plight of women and anticipated much of what Betty Friedan wrote in The Feminine Mystique eight years later. But Anne was also at the tragic centre of the infamous Lindbergh kidnapping in 1932, when the couple's first-born, Charles Jr, was snatched and held to ransom, though already murdered. A carpenter, Bruno Hauptmann, was executed for the crime in 1936, but his guilt is still controversial.</p> <p>Anne then became embroiled in the charges of anti-semitism and pro-Nazi sentiments that engulfed her husband in the late 1930s and 40s, as both joined the American isolationist movement. Despite a muddled book she wrote in support of their views - it was described by a biographer of her husband as \"one of the most despised books of its day\" - recent evidence suggests that she was less enthused than Charles, and thought he might be making a grave mistake.</p> <p>Finally, after a gap of 15 years, she began writing again, and was largely forgiven for her pre-war views, which she recanted anyway during a period in which she published well-received volumes of diaries and letters. Her husband died in 1974 and she stopped writing in 1980. In 1991 she suffered the first of a series of debilitating strokes and kept to her house in Vermont.</p> <p>Although her husband was a Minnesota farm boy, Anne was born into an upper-class family in New Jersey. Her father, Dwight Whitney Morrow was a senator and partner in JP Morgan. Her mother, Elizabeth, was a poet and educator, and on the board of Smith University. Anne followed her there in 1924 to study English.</p> <p>After meeting Lindbergh, Anne, a diminutive, shy young woman, was hurled into the maelstrom of fame and publicity that surrounded \"Lindy\". The press besieged them constantly, and the barrage was one reason they took to the air so often. On Easter morning 1930, they broke the speed record from Los Angeles to New York, taking 15 hours. Anne was seven months pregnant, but wrote: \"I couldn't complain. It would prove I'm a weak woman.\"</p> <p>After the birth of their doomed son, the publicity became unbearable, and she later blamed it for the kidnapping. When their second son, Jon, was born in 1935, reporters sideswiped the Lindbergh car and wrenched open a door to photograph the boy. The Lindberghs immediately fled to England, where another child was born in London.</p> <p>Her first book, North to the Orient, was published in 1937 and became a bestseller. It related their flight to China via Canada and Alaska, a heroic deed in those days. Another aviation book, Listen! The Wind, came out in 1938 and was praised as a \"small work of art\".</p> <p>But Charles was now getting involved in dubious politics. During their time in London and Paris, they had visited Germany, where Charles was impressed by the aircraft industry. Anne was not present in 1938 at a \"stag\" dinner at the US Embassy in Berlin, when Hermann Goering, Hitler's air minister, presented Lindbergh with a medal. After the dinner, Charles showed the box to his wife. She opened it, glanced inside and looked away. Then she said without emotion, 'the Albatross'.\"It was a prophetic remark.</p> <p>Denounced in America over the medal, the Lindberghs even thought of moving to Berlin. Then in 1941, Lindbergh made a speech in Iowa saying that the \"Jewish race\" in America was clamouring for war. He was denounced by a Roosevelt cabinet member as \"the number one Nazi fellow-traveller.\"</p> <p>In her isolationist book, The Wave of the Future, Anne Lindbergh condemned Nazi tyranny but argued that it was unstoppable, the future, and - in a howler that must rank among the world's worst - described Hitler as \"not greedy for power\". Later she reflected that Charles's 1941 speech might have been an \"unconscious bid\" for leadership in anti-Jewish politics, but she never wrote an autobiography or analysed that period in detail.</p> <p>She is survived by a daughter and three sons.</p> <p>\u0095 Anne Spencer Morrow Lindbergh, writer and aviator, born June 22 1906; died February 7 2001.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In a programme note for his last appearance on stage at Covent Garden in November 1993, Dame Ninette de Valois wrote: \"If ever a member were ever to be called 'legendary' in the Royal Ballet it should certainly be Leslie Edwards.\" Edwards, who has died of cancer at the age of 84, was a pioneer dancer of the Royal Ballet who served the company as an outstanding dancer actor for more than 60 years. He appeared in more than 70 different roles; was ballet master to the Royal Opera for 20 years; and for 26 years was, most significantly, the guiding spirit behind the Royal Ballet's Choreographic Group. He epitomised the loyalty, integrity, professionalism and sense of duty which characterised those pioneer dancers of the 1930s and enabled them to build the foundation on which Britain's national ballet was to rest. Born in Teddington, at the age of 16 Edwards was sent by his then teacher, Marie Rambert, to Ninette de Valois at Sadler's Wells because she \"needed an extra boy\" - in those days they always needed an extra boy.

The Maharajah of Gwalior discovered yesterday that his mother, Rajmata, who died two weeks ago, aged 82, had left all of the family's priceless treasures - including jewels, dazzling crystals, and numerous properties - to her \"Rasputin-like\" 81-year-old personal secretary and a number of trusts. Some 500 of the maharajah's angry retainers immediately besieged the family's Italian palazzo-style palace in the historic town of Gwalior, demanding that the will be amended in his favour. The maharajah's friends have accused the secretary, Sardar SC Angre, of conspiring to influence the rajmata in her declining years to deprive her son of the estate. \"He was more than just a secretary. I would not go as far as to suggest any physical involvement, but there is no doubt he was extremely influential on her,\" one family source said last night. \"He was a Rasputin-like presence.\" The maharajah, Madhavrao Scindia, fell out with his mother in the 1970s when he joined the Congress party. He is now its deputy leader. The rajmata, meanwhile, became a stalwart of the rightwing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, persecuted by Indira Gandhi but currently in power. The feud between mother and son was well known, but few had expected it to carry on in death. In her will, written in 1985, the rajmata said her son had \"rendered himself unfit to cremate his mother's dead body\". \"Any mother can imagine how painful and agonising it is to disown her only son - but the way my son disowned all that the Scindias stood for in their long struggle in defence of the country left me with no option,\" she wrote. In the end the maharajah burned his mother before her will was made public. The Scindias are one of India's most illustrious princely families: a 19th-century predecessor was one of only five maharajahs awarded a 21-gun salute by the British, in recognition of his status. In the 1857 Indian uprising, the maharajah stayed loyal to the British cause, even though his troops carried out a mutiny. Last night, attention was focused on the fate of the late rajmata's priceless jewellery collection, hidden in a series of steel cupboards in the family's Italianate Jai Vilas palace. Its 35 rooms also contain two giant chandeliers, each weighing 3.5 tonnes, as well as a silver bath tub, several moth-eaten stuffed tigers, and a model railway used to carry brandy and cigars around the table after dinner. The chandeliers were only hung after 10 elephants tested the roof.

      "body": "<p>These Open Door columns fall into roughly three categories: one dealing with ethical issues raised by the Guardian's journalism; another addressing your frequently justified protests at our abuse of the English language; and the third describing how various parts of the Guardian work, or answering your questions about technical matters such as Why does the ink come off on your hands? (copies of that column are still dispatched to readers on request). </p> <p>Columns in the last category - into which this one also falls - often coincide with or anticipate important changes within the Guardian. An example was the column I wrote discussing points you had raised about the paper's coverage in the north of England. I was able to treat the subject with reasonable enthusiasm because in the course of researching it the editor revealed his plans for a special edition, Guardian North, which is now well established. The complaints now are that the edition does not extend over a large enough geographical area. </p> <p>This week I set out to talk to colleagues about questions you have raised broadly covering aspects of the appearance of the paper, in particular whether the sometimes slack crediting of illustrations implied an undervaluing of the contribution they make to the Guardian. One thing that prompted a sharp response from a reader was the publication of an uncredited image from the distinctive hand of Norman Rockwell, the artist who, perhaps more than any other, delineated the softer side of the American dream. The illustration arrived unidentified from an agency and no one recognised the image, which we credited as a \"photograph\" where \"illustration\" would at least have been more accurate. </p> <p>These things happen.

      "bodyText": "These Open Door columns fall into roughly three categories: one dealing with ethical issues raised by the Guardian's journalism; another addressing your frequently justified protests at our abuse of the English language; and the third describing how various parts of the Guardian work, or answering your questions about technical matters such as Why does the ink come off on your hands? (copies of that column are still dispatched to readers on request). Columns in the last category - into which this one also falls - often coincide with or anticipate important changes within the Guardian. An example was the column I wrote discussing points you had raised about the paper's coverage in the north of England. I was able to treat the subject with reasonable enthusiasm because in the course of researching it the editor revealed his plans for a special edition, Guardian North, which is now well established. The complaints now are that the edition does not extend over a large enough geographical area. This week I set out to talk to colleagues about questions you have raised broadly covering aspects of the appearance of the paper, in particular whether the sometimes slack crediting of illustrations implied an undervaluing of the contribution they make to the Guardian. One thing that prompted a sharp response from a reader was the publication of an uncredited image from the distinctive hand of Norman Rockwell, the artist who, perhaps more than any other, delineated the softer side of the American dream. The illustration arrived unidentified from an agency and no one recognised the image, which we credited as a \"photograph\" where \"illustration\" would at least have been more accurate. These things happen. But on the bigger point, of undervaluing illustration, nothing could be farther from the truth. Various forms of illustration, including cartoons, have played an important part in the Guardian since the period following the first world war when David Low joined the paper. There has been a leading political cartoonist on the Guardian since then, among them, Papas, Gibbard, and now, of course, Steve Bell. A colleague, recently retired, who fought for a real place in the paper for cartoonists and illustrators, from the 1960s onwards, points to the advances in the past decade or a little longer. Bigger papers, the publication of a magazine, and the need to have a change of pace between different types of article, made the use of illustrations, he believes, inevitable. \"The introduction of a bona fide design department staffed by trained designers, rather than just journalists with design flair, brought about major changes whereby illustration became regarded as a vitally important ingredient of a successful Guardian.

This is the delightful German name for what we prosaically call pest controllers. Ours has just arrived - a thin young man dressed from head to foot in black. As I write, he is tracing the stinking line of urine and other body fluid left by the rat back to that cosy duster box. It might wish to bring its friends and family. Dr Bauer-Dubau reckoned there would be a colony nearby. \"Of about how many?\" I asked, as casually as possible. \"Oh, up to 60,\" she said. And smiled prettily.",

The White House ordered the most comprehensive defence review since the cold war and a senior Moscow analyst warned of \"an acute and all-embracing crisis\" in relations between the US and Russia. The Russian foreign ministry issued a statement attacking the head of the CIA, George Tenet, who told the US congress this week that Russia under President Vladimir Putin had embarked on a whole series of moves inimical to US interests. Mr Tenet's remarks followed an angry performance by Sergei Ivanov, Mr Putin's closest aide, in Munich last weekend, in which Mr Ivanov warned the west against profiteering in demanding debt repayments from Russia. Mr Ivanov, secretary of Russia's security council, accused Nato of triggering a Chernobyl-type disaster in its 1999 war against Yugoslavia, and threatened an arms race if the Bush administration pushed ahead with its controversial plans for a national anti-missile defence shield.

      "bodyText": "European Union citizens should pay a \"Euro-tax\" directly to the union, which must become more democratic as it plans its future, the prime minister of Belgium, Guy Verhofstadt, has urged. As Mr Verhofstadt will chair the EU's rotating presidency from July, his outspokenly federalist comments are bound to be studied closely by Europe's leaders. In an interview published in a Brussels-based weekly yesterday, he made clear that he would use the Belgian presidency in the second half of this year to promote a radical view of the future of the union; this will set alarm bells ringing among British Eurosceptics. The liberal prime minister, cultivated as an ally by Tony Blair on economic issues, made no secret of his strongly integrationist approach, which is certain to influence preparations for the next EU treaty review in 2004. Crucially, Mr Verhofstadt will set the agenda for the so-called inter-governmental conference (IGC) at the Laeken summit in December - although, as president, he will also have to consider the views of other member states. British officials have said that it would a \"disaster\" if Belgium has too much influence over what is discussed, especially if there is wide support for making the controversial Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding. Alain Gerlache, a spokesman for the Belgian leader, said Mr Verhofstadt's comments were part of the broad debate about the EU, which began last May when the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, suggested that the union be given a constitution. France and Britain have both since made clear they want the EU to remain a club of nation states in which the council of ministers, where the 15 governments cooperate, wields more clout than the supranational European commission. Mr Verhofstadt was not specific about his most radical proposal, the EU-wide tax, but he said it was the \"best solution\" to replace the complex contribution system currently in place. \"Like everyone pays their local and national taxes, you should have a direct-financing system for the EU,\" he said yesterday. Belgium, one of the six founding members of the European Economic Community in 1957, has long been a champion of deeper integration, partly because it is itself so federal that its national identity sometimes seems in doubt. Mr Verhofstadt's views, however, are bound to upset countries such as Britain, Denmark and Sweden, highly sceptical of more integration at the expense of national sovereignty. Belgium has also been trying to enhance the role of the 12-member group of finance ministers of the euro-zone, to the irritation of the three euro \"outs\", which are worried that the forum of all 15 ministers, Ecofin, is being weakened. \"Until now we have seen Europe as an evolutionary process. But when we have geographically re-unified the European continent, I think it is absolutely necessary to have a final debate about what the EU is for - what competences it has and what type of institutions it needs,\" Mr Verhofstadt told the magazine European Voice.

      "bodyText": "Israeli tanks pounded Palestinian gunmen in the most ferocious clashes for weeks yesterday as the Bush administration disowned months of dogged effort by President Bill Clinton to deliver a peace deal in the Middle East. Yesterday afternoon's gun battle in the West Bank city of Ramallah was a clear message from the field commanders of the Palestinian uprising that the hardline policies of Israel's prime minister-elect, Ariel Sharon, will only reap more violence. In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, a teenage shepherd was killed by Israeli tank fire near the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom. He was the first Palestinian to be killed in the violence that has erupted since Mr Sharon's landslide victory on Tuesday. Yesterday morning Mr Sharon met the outgoing prime minister, Ehud Barak, to discuss forming a national unity government. Mr Sharon offered Mr Barak the post of defence minister. However, yesterday's violence overshadowed Mr Sharon's attempts at coalition building and the tentative diplomatic moves by the US and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to gauge the true intentions of Israel's most celebrated hardliner. The Palestinian leader telephoned Mr Sharon yesterday seeking to resume negotiations. \"The condition for that is a complete halt to violence,\" Mr Sharon responded. All signs point to an escalation in violence, with Mr Sharon confronting a car bomb in an ultra-orthodox Jewish neighbourhood of Jerusalem, sustained firing overnight on the Jewish settlement of Psagot, and gun battles in Ramallah - all within 72 hours of his election. The other plank of Mr Sharon's peace policy is his refusal to honour Mr Barak's promises on territory and Jerusalem that brought Israel \"closer than ever before\" to a peace deal with the Palestinians at the Red Sea resort of Taba last month. The talks were broadly based on proposals put forward by Mr Clinton in his last days of office. But the Bush administration has made it clear that it has scrapped any existing Clinton proposals and has stepped back from the active mediation practised by Mr Clinton . \"The ideas and parameters that were discussed in the last few months are - were - President Clinton's parameters and, therefore, when he left office, they were no longer a US proposal or presidential proposal,\" the state department spokesman, Richard Boucher, told reporters on Thursday. However, the US secretary of State, Colin Powell, is to visit Israel and the Palestinian-ruled areas later this month, and Mr Bush telephoned Mr Sharon and Mr Arafat to urge them to calm the region. Mr Powell's trip - to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Gaza and the West Bank, Jordan and Kuwait - will be his first foreign trip alone since he took office on January 20. Mr Bush told reporters: \"I certainly hope that people recognise a change does not necessarily mean that the peace process won't go forward. And I think we ought to take Mr Sharon for his word and that is, he wants to promote peace in the Middle East.\" But in Ramallah yesterday demonstrators scattered for cover as Palestinian gunmen holed up in empty tower blocks shot over their heads at Israeli troops on an adjacent hill. Nearly 30 people were injured by live fire and rubber-coated steel bullets.

Ms Rich cited her fifth amendment rights protecting her from self-incrimination but the committee chairman, Dan Burton, has said he might offer her immunity and compel her to testify. Her lawyers admitted in a response to written questions that Ms Rich had pledged \"an enormous amount of money\" for the planned Clinton presidential library in Arkansas. The library donation, coming soon after revelations about Ms Rich's $1.4m contribution to the Democratic party election campaign and her purchase of furniture for the Clintons, has added to the sense of sleaze which accompanied the former first family's departure from office. Democrats have lined up with Republicans in denouncing the pardon for Mr Rich, who was charged with tax evasion and trading with an enemy nation, Iran, while hostages were being held in Tehran. He now lives in Switzerland. Eric Holder, the former deputy attorney general, admitted to the House committee on government reform that he had erred when he told the Clinton White House that he was \"neutral, leaning toward favourable\" about the Rich pardon. He said he had not known all the facts of the case against Mr Rich, and he denied he had recommended a pardon in the hope of enlisting the help of Mr Rich's lawyer, Jack Quinn, in securing the top job in the justice department if Al Gore won last year's election.

Dr Brown, the principal author, told the Guardian, however: \"It would be a good idea to talk about it and find out whether or not this would be an acceptable compromise.\" Restrictions on the use of corneas might be a useful test case since the eyes linked to the brain and were a potentially infective part of the body. \"You would not necessarily accept organs, say, from people who died under a certain age, until we found out more about how risky these are. At the moment we can assume they are either not risky or very low risk. There is a world of difference between the two.\" Experts are particularly worried about eye and teeth surgery because of their links to the central nervous system where vCJD strikes. Opticians and dentists have already been warned to change procedures. The thinking behind restricting corneal donation to older people appears to be the supposition that most victims of vCJD so far have been relatively young. They were most at risk in the mid-80s to early-90s when food safety controls were introduced. Also, unlike other organs such as hearts, lungs or kidneys which deteriorate with age, eyes from far older donors can still be offered. However, many scientists believe they do not know enough about the incubation or infectivity to justify age differentials. The Department of Health said: \"We are not proposing to change our policy on CJD risk grounds at the moment.\"",

Clearly it is being done for political reasons.\"</p> <p>The project is part of what China calls its campaign to \"develop the west\", including Tibet. Beijing has indicated that it is prepared to make the huge investment needed to improve the living standards of a region officially considered the most \"backward\" in China.</p> <p>The railway has been talked about for five decades. Work did eventually start in the 1980s but ground to a halt after 520 miles at Golmud in the neighbouring province of Qinghai. This section has since been upgraded and is the main route for supplies to Tibet which are trucked the rest of the way to Lhasa.</p> <p>So far the route into Tibet has not been revealed. But after entering the Tibet Autonomous Region, the existing road which the railway is likely to follow passes through the isolated towns of Amdo and Nagqu.</p> <p>Travellers have described the road as \"the roughest and most stunning of journeys\" into Tibet. In 1998 it was swept by blizzards which began in September, killing hundreds of thousands of livestock.</p> <p>Most of the route is extremely sparsely populated. It provides employment for small numbers of semi-nomadic herdsmen and for a few hardened salt and mineral miners. Part of the region was recently hit by a severe earthquake and landslides are frequent.</p> <p>The logistics of the operation are daunting. Four-fifths of the 700-mile railway will be built at an altitude over 4,000 metres, and more than half will be constructed on permafrost.</p> <p>Chinese research institutes are said to have been studying the problems of building on permafrost since the 1950s. China claims that \"the key technological problems in railway engineering on the frozen earth of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau have by and large been solved\".</p> <p>But experts note that building on permafrost is not always the most difficult aspect of such a project. The Trans-siberian railway has encountered problems recently because parts of the hardened frost on which the lines are laid has begun to melt, possibly because of global warming, causing the track to buckle.</p> <p>Probably the hardest task will be the sharp climb up to the Tanggulashan range (5,200 metres) - source of the Yangtze and Mekong rivers. A large goods train will struggle to ascend a gradient of more than 3% safely, making the construction of tunnels a necessity.</p> <p>China has become one of the world's leading railway builders, laying 1,000 miles of track a year. Over the past 20 years its technology has improved vastly. In general it has preferred to develop its own machines rather than import them and has had some success exporting rolling stock.</p> <p>There are several railway construction bureaux across the country. For such a project two bureaux might team up to do the work. Normally the Chinese prefer to use more manpower and fewer machines - though it is not possible to know how many workers will be needed to complete the line. However many, the work will be very dangerous and lives will probably be lost.</p> <p>Chris Jackson, deputy editor of Railway Gazette International, said: \"It will require very skilful engineering but it not impossible. Ten or 15 years ago the Chinese were using picks and shovels to build their railways. Now they have excellent machinery and resources.\"</p> <p>Railway experts across the globe will be watching with interest. Brian Green, technical director of Reading-based GIBB Rail, said: \"Getting through the mountain terrain is going to be the biggest challenge, finding the right gradient.\" But he questioned the economics. \"To justify a railway economically you need to get freight traffic through it, perhaps 10m tonnes a year. I can't see that happening.\"</p> <p>There are fears that the export to Tibet of China's modern and commercial way of life will dilute the territory's ethnic and religious character. Critics say the line is part of a cynical strategy to reduce the demand for religious and political freedom.</p> <p>Environmental problems could also be created. The railway will pass through one of the last habitats of the Tibetan Antelope, or chiru. Once seen by 19th century explorers in vast herds, it is the only large mammal, excluding man, endemic to the Tibetan plateau.</p> <p>Beijing's decision was announced with the full weight of authority of its most senior leaders.</p> <p>An announcement published yesterday claimed that the line would be \"the longest and most elevated railway built on highlands in the world\". Feasibility studies and route planning were under way, but the report did not give a starting date for construction. President Jiang Zemin was quoted as saying that the railway was \"highly necessary\".</p> <p>According to Premier Zhu Rongji, the railway would \"accelerate economic and social development in Tibet... and reinforce unity among various ethnic groups\".</p> <p><b>Great railway feats</b></p> <p><b> Trans-Siberian railway</b></p> <p>The railway linking Moscow and Vladivostok opened in 1904, one of the greatest ever feats of engineering. A parallel line is now in operation. Recently, the gradual melting of the permafrost has caused parts of the track to twist and sink. The 5,773-mile journey takes more than 150 hours.</p> <p><b> Canadian Pacific railway</b></p> <p>The last spike of the Canadian Pacific railway, linking the Atlantic to the Pacific through tthe Rockies, was hammered home in November 1885. The line was upgraded in the 1980s and 1990s. There are plans to build a fixed rail link between the USA and Alaska.</p> <p><b> Andes</b></p> <p>British engineers were behind many of the schemes at the turn of the century to build rail links across the Andes. Among the spectacular routes is the Transandine line linking Buenos Aires to Valparaiso. It is not so much the height which is staggering but the steepness of the climb.</p> <p><b> Africa</b></p> <p>Rhodes's vision of a rail link from the Cape to Cairo has never been achieved. However, there have been remarkable feats of railway engineering in Africa, including the 2,900-mile line from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania to Kapiri Mposshi in Zambia.</p> <p><b> Australia</b></p> <p>The longest straight stretch of track - 297 miles - is on the Nullabour plain in south Australia. Though the flatness of the countryside made laying track relatively easy, the isolation of the area caused huge logistical difficulties.</p>",

China claims that \"the key technological problems in railway engineering on the frozen earth of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau have by and large been solved\". But experts note that building on permafrost is not always the most difficult aspect of such a project. The Trans-siberian railway has encountered problems recently because parts of the hardened frost on which the lines are laid has begun to melt, possibly because of global warming, causing the track to buckle. Probably the hardest task will be the sharp climb up to the Tanggulashan range (5,200 metres) - source of the Yangtze and Mekong rivers. A large goods train will struggle to ascend a gradient of more than 3% safely, making the construction of tunnels a necessity. China has become one of the world's leading railway builders, laying 1,000 miles of track a year. Over the past 20 years its technology has improved vastly. In general it has preferred to develop its own machines rather than import them and has had some success exporting rolling stock. There are several railway construction bureaux across the country. For such a project two bureaux might team up to do the work. Normally the Chinese prefer to use more manpower and fewer machines - though it is not possible to know how many workers will be needed to complete the line. However many, the work will be very dangerous and lives will probably be lost. Chris Jackson, deputy editor of Railway Gazette International, said: \"It will require very skilful engineering but it not impossible. Ten or 15 years ago the Chinese were using picks and shovels to build their railways. Now they have excellent machinery and resources.\" Railway experts across the globe will be watching with interest. Brian Green, technical director of Reading-based GIBB Rail, said: \"Getting through the mountain terrain is going to be the biggest challenge, finding the right gradient.\" But he questioned the economics. \"To justify a railway economically you need to get freight traffic through it, perhaps 10m tonnes a year. I can't see that happening.\" There are fears that the export to Tibet of China's modern and commercial way of life will dilute the territory's ethnic and religious character. Critics say the line is part of a cynical strategy to reduce the demand for religious and political freedom. Environmental problems could also be created. The railway will pass through one of the last habitats of the Tibetan Antelope, or chiru. Once seen by 19th century explorers in vast herds, it is the only large mammal, excluding man, endemic to the Tibetan plateau. Beijing's decision was announced with the full weight of authority of its most senior leaders. An announcement published yesterday claimed that the line would be \"the longest and most elevated railway built on highlands in the world\". Feasibility studies and route planning were under way, but the report did not give a starting date for construction. President Jiang Zemin was quoted as saying that the railway was \"highly necessary\". According to Premier Zhu Rongji, the railway would \"accelerate economic and social development in Tibet... and reinforce unity among various ethnic groups\". Great railway feats Trans-Siberian railway The railway linking Moscow and Vladivostok opened in 1904, one of the greatest ever feats of engineering. A parallel line is now in operation. Recently, the gradual melting of the permafrost has caused parts of the track to twist and sink. The 5,773-mile journey takes more than 150 hours. Canadian Pacific railway The last spike of the Canadian Pacific railway, linking the Atlantic to the Pacific through tthe Rockies, was hammered home in November 1885. The line was upgraded in the 1980s and 1990s. There are plans to build a fixed rail link between the USA and Alaska. Andes British engineers were behind many of the schemes at the turn of the century to build rail links across the Andes. Among the spectacular routes is the Transandine line linking Buenos Aires to Valparaiso. It is not so much the height which is staggering but the steepness of the climb. Africa Rhodes's vision of a rail link from the Cape to Cairo has never been achieved. However, there have been remarkable feats of railway engineering in Africa, including the 2,900-mile line from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania to Kapiri Mposshi in Zambia. Australia The longest straight stretch of track - 297 miles - is on the Nullabour plain in south Australia. Though the flatness of the countryside made laying track relatively easy, the isolation of the area caused huge logistical difficulties.",

It was said very frankly that they didn't want me to come to any harm,\" he said. \"I've been trying to think of a gesture that would be appreciated and not futile... I've decided not to go.\" Mr Chinamasa also paid a visit to the supreme court justice, Ahmed Ibrahim. It is not known if he decided to resign. The Mugabe government is attacking the supreme court because it has reversed some of its policies. In December the court ruled that Mr Mugabe's \"fast-track\" land seizures were illegal and ordered the police to uphold the rule of law and remove squatters from privately owned farms. In January, it said that Mr Mugabe could not amend the law to prevent the results of parliamentary elections being challenged on the grounds of violence, intimidation and fraud. Mr Mugabe, cabinet ministers and the leader of the \"war veterans\", Chenjerai Hunzvi, have bitterly denounced the supreme court justices, calling them \"relics of Rhodesia\". It is understood that Mr Mugabe is to appoint a new, more compliant, supreme court. \"[Forcing Chief Justice Gubbay to retire] is a signal to the rest of the world that Zimbabwe's government fears the law and is determined to subvert it,\" the Zimbabwe Independent newspaper said yesterday. Harare's efforts to neutralise the courts coincide with its moves to muzzle the country's independent press. Two weeks ago it called for the critical Daily News to be closed down; an explosion then destroyed its printing presses. Harare's legal community, however, is taking heart at Justice McNally's stand. \"It was distressing when Chief Justice Gubbay succumbed to the government's threats. If the chief justice cannot stand up for principle then who can?\" one Harare lawyer, who did not want to be named, said. \"That is why the legal community, lawyers both black and white, are so pleased that Justice McNally has decided to stand up for what is right.\"",

Then a Manchester roadshow came to London with northern food and drink.</p> <p>Now Merseysiders are being professionally briefed on northern statistics so they can subtly sell the region to southerners at dinner parties.</p> <p>These marketing campaigns, most government-funded, are part of Labour's latest attempt to move people and businesses north and turn regional cities into alternative European high-flyers similar to Barcelona, Lyon or Milan.</p> <p>This month a series of adverts will appear on London's underground, buses and black cabs aimed at upping the status of northern regions and selling them to London. The government has paid hundreds of thousands of pounds for cities to be branded by regional development agencies and public-private partnerships. The EU has put money into research on how to advertise English cities to the English.</p> <p>According to EU-funded research, Londoners need adverts for other cities because the English are painfully ignorant about geography. Southerners think Yorkshire is all mining and thatched cottages, Manchester is rain and Merseyside is the Beatles - when in fact it is the nation's capital for call centres. People are not investing because they don't know how good these regions are.</p> <p>To counter this, the Mersey Partnership this week launches a London ad campaign informing commuters: \"Merseyside is the golfing capital of England\", \"Merseyside is one of the safest city regions in the UK\", and \"Liverpool has more museums, theatres and galleries than any other UK city outside London\".</p> <p>Yorkshire Forward follows up in March with posters on the tube telling commuters: \"Yorkshire's full of bankers\" and \"e-by gum!\", drawing on the fact that 70% of Yorkshire people work in financial or business services and 33% of all UK internet traffic goes through the region.</p> <p>Barrie Kelly, head of marketing at the Mersey Partnership, said: \"Research has found people in the south-east are completely ignorant about Merseyside and the north. They think it's all football and the Beatles. They haven't got a clue about the cultural diversity, which is why our posters in London use \"wow facts\" aimed at educating them. The image of the north has improved by 40% in the last five years.

      "bodyText": "First a group of Yorkshiremen stood outside King's Cross station in rush hour, handing Londoners Yorkie bars wrapped in a list of reasons why they should move to Bradford. Then a Manchester roadshow came to London with northern food and drink. Now Merseysiders are being professionally briefed on northern statistics so they can subtly sell the region to southerners at dinner parties. These marketing campaigns, most government-funded, are part of Labour's latest attempt to move people and businesses north and turn regional cities into alternative European high-flyers similar to Barcelona, Lyon or Milan. This month a series of adverts will appear on London's underground, buses and black cabs aimed at upping the status of northern regions and selling them to London. The government has paid hundreds of thousands of pounds for cities to be branded by regional development agencies and public-private partnerships. The EU has put money into research on how to advertise English cities to the English. According to EU-funded research, Londoners need adverts for other cities because the English are painfully ignorant about geography. Southerners think Yorkshire is all mining and thatched cottages, Manchester is rain and Merseyside is the Beatles - when in fact it is the nation's capital for call centres. People are not investing because they don't know how good these regions are. To counter this, the Mersey Partnership this week launches a London ad campaign informing commuters: \"Merseyside is the golfing capital of England\", \"Merseyside is one of the safest city regions in the UK\", and \"Liverpool has more museums, theatres and galleries than any other UK city outside London\". Yorkshire Forward follows up in March with posters on the tube telling commuters: \"Yorkshire's full of bankers\" and \"e-by gum!\", drawing on the fact that 70% of Yorkshire people work in financial or business services and 33% of all UK internet traffic goes through the region. Barrie Kelly, head of marketing at the Mersey Partnership, said: \"Research has found people in the south-east are completely ignorant about Merseyside and the north. They think it's all football and the Beatles. They haven't got a clue about the cultural diversity, which is why our posters in London use \"wow facts\" aimed at educating them. The image of the north has improved by 40% in the last five years. We are working to further that.\" At the centre of the regional campaigns are the \"quality of life\" wars between northern cities competing for stressed London exiles. Merseyside is reminding Londoners that 36% of the region is greenbelt. Manchester and Yorkshire cities are squabbling over how long it takes to get into countryside from the centre of town. \"In Manchester it's strictly fields you can get to in 20 minutes, whereas from Leeds, Sheffield or York you're in open countryside which is much better,\" said Theresa Lindsay of the Yorkshire Forward campaign. The Marketing Manchester group is focusing less on London poster campaigns and more on cornering the weekend break tourist market, especially from Ireland and Europe. Fact books and vouchers are being distributed in tie-ins with travel groups and credit cards. And Manchester's Mission Metropolis roadshow returns to London this year so business conference organisers can sample Manchester products \"without travelling north of Hemel Hempstead\". Will the marketing work? The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions said promotion was a small but essential part of economic development in the regions. Yorkshire Forward reported that when their team handed out Yorkie bars in London stations few factsheets were trampled underfoot, which suggested Londoners were clinging to any hope of a better life up north.

      "body": "<p>Once upon a time, in the seaside town of Rottingdean, there was a wishing stone. One day, some six years ago, four men visiting the town solicited good luck from the stone shortly before they went into a shop looking for fossils.</p> <p>\"I collect fossils, so we went into this shop looking for trilobites,\" one of the men explains. \"It was full of snowstorms and seaside junk, and the woman behind the counter was really defensive. She never said anything, but she looked at us as though one of us was going to steal something. After we left, we joked about her saying something like \"I have a husband upstairs\" or \"I have guns\" to scare us.\"</p> <p>Whether the woman in the Rottingdean shop near the wishing stone killed strangers, ate hair sandwiches and danced naked in the moonlight remains unclear. She would, after all, become the inspiration for one of the quartet's greatest creations: the murderous, incestuous and porcine owners of Royston Vasey's Local Shop - 'for local people' - whose stock of Precious Things includes tinned peaches, carbolic soap, bundles of sticks, James Hadley Chase novels and, of course, snowstorms.</p> <p>The potency of the wishing stone, on the other hand, seems apparent: \"I really did wish that we could get to Edinburgh and the show really took off,\" recalls one of the men. \"And now you've remembered it, the spell will be broken,\" another adds ominously. \"You shouldn't have said it out loud,\" sighs another, narrowing his eyes. I half-expect the sky to blacken and lightning to rip across it, even though it's 11 o'clock on a bright Wednesday morning. The League of Gentlemen have that effect.</p> <p>They look so normal, too. Mark Gatiss is a tall, warm-hearted chap who carries a battered, brown briefcase. He could be an academic. Reece Shearsmith looks like your sister's boyfriend, and is wearing natty Camper shoes. Steve Pemberton apologises profusely for being late, something to do with trains or buses. And Jeremy Dyson reminds me of my lawyer cousin Andrew, who, for a while, built Daleks out of cardboard and stuck split peas on the sides to emulate the rivets.</p> <p>Sitting in the office of the producer of their tour - A Local Show For Local People, which next month starts a three-week run in London - the fossil- collecting Gatiss proudly recounts how one review of their first series said that the Local Shop says more about modern Britain than anything in Bill Bryson's Notes From A Small Island. \"It's the universality of it,\" he adds. \"It's not just a northern town, because people will say, 'Ooh, Wales is like that', or 'I know someone like that from Sussex'. Plus, it has done terribly well abroad, so the Local Shop particularly, and the town in general, must say something about those countries, too. There is some element of Royston Vasey in everyone.\"</p> <p>Which would be a worrying thought, given that Royston Vasey is populated by murderers and monsters, sadists and saddos, freaks and fetishists, and maybe even cannibals. An everyday tale of country folks it ain't. The characters that The League of Gentlemen have created range from the Rottingdean-inspired Tubbs and Edward, who run the Local Shop, through Babs, the pre-transsexual cab driver ('with nipples like bullets') to Hillary Briss, the black-hearted butcher who trades in 'special stuff'.</p> <p>They have introduced an unsuspecting public to the misanthropic Reverend Bernice Woodall, who conceals contraband cigarettes in the confession booths; the toad-obsessed, anal-retentive Denton family; Pauline Campbell Jones, scourge of the unemployed, despite the fact that she's a restart officer; and the chilling ringmaster, Papa Lazarou, whose shibboleth, 'You're my wife now, Dave', makes no sense whatsoever, but is knicker-wettingly frightening nonetheless.</p> <p>It is difficult to categorise a show about such people simply as comedy, as Dyson readily admits: \"Sketches about a grief-stricken cave guide haunted by a tragic accident on a school trip, or about a German homosexual exchange teacher are not the stuff of Russ Abbott's Madhouse.\"</p> <p>Nor is the League's frame of reference typical in contemporary British comedy. Their shows have an incredible pedigree, with nods to comedy, horror, melodrama, literature and comic books. In their cracking Christmas special alone, there were references to a host of books and films, from the familiar Salem's Lot, Eyes Wide Shut and The Railway Children, to the more obscure, such as the Ealing thriller Dead Of Night and WW Jacobs' The Monkey's Paw.</p> <p>Their blend of gothic drama and gallows humour has led to comparisons with everything from Monty Python to Twin Peaks, and seen them described as Tod Browning meets Peak Practice - Freak Practice, if you will. But, in the end, The League of Gentlemen are simply The League of Gentlemen: comparisons and descriptions are futile. Perverse geniuses, they have to be seen to be believed. The Brothers Grimmer.</p> <p>All of this you will already know if you've seen the television show. You'll also know that Royston Vasey and its idiosyncratic inhabitants have caught the strangeness of Britain - its insularity, hypocrisies and freakishness - in gloriously minute detail. You may even be planning to join the hardcore fans' pilgrimage to Hadfield, Derbyshire, where the TV show is filmed (costume is optional) or logging on to one of the burgeoning websites and chat groups. If you haven't seen The League of Gentlemen, however, all of this will mean absolutely nothing to you. And you really should stay in more.</p> <p>Gatiss, Pemberton and Shearsmith met while studying drama at Bretton Hall College in Wakefield. \"We bonded over Brecht,\" says Gatiss, initially the most genial of the three. \"Steve and I were in the same year, and they had put up the photos of the new intake, one of whom was Reece. We were laughing, not just at his photo but at his name, too. We thought 'Reece Shearsmith' was like a Little Lord Fauntleroy character.\"</p> <p>\"I think the first time we met, we were doing a musical production of The Taming Of The Shrew,\" Pemberton recalls. \"Not Kiss Me Kate - that would have made sense - but it was a sung-through version of the play. It was absolutely dreadful.\" At the same time, Gatiss was introduced to Dyson, who was studying philosophy in Leeds, by a mutual friend.</p> <p>\"The guy I shared a flat with when we left school went to Bretton Hall to do drama, and in his first or second week he rang me and said I had to meet this bloke because he was just like me,\" says Dyson. \"Normally, I cringe when people say that: it's a recipe for disaster. I met him and resisted liking him for half an hour, but as soon as he started talking about the lost John Inman sitcom I had been trying to remember the name of for three years - it was around for one season in 1977 and was set in a factory - I knew we were destined to get on.\" (It took Gatiss and Dyson another three years to find out that the sitcom was called Odd Man Out.)</p> <p>Through Gatiss, Dyson met Pemberton and Shearsmith, and it wasn't long before the four of them established collective memories and shared experiences. When I ask each of them individually to tell me about their childhoods, Pemberton smiles and says, \"It's probably the same story four times.\"</p> <p>\"We all watched Carry On Screaming on the same night,\" says Gatiss. \"Bonfire Night, 1976.\" Are you trying to find some childhood trauma to explain why we do The League of Gentlemen? Shearsmith eyes me suspiciously. \"I don't remember any savage incident that would turn me into what you think I am.\"</p> <p>So, I ask, you're just four northern lads with typical childhoods? They bristle at the N word. \"We always get 'four northern lads',\" says Reece. \"If we were from anywhere else, no one would say 'four southern lads'.\" He is right, but perhaps in a comedy landscape that is more commonly the habitat of Oxbridge types, their northernness really is seen as a break from the norm. Whatever, they get annoyed at the fetishisation of the north (of England) as a place that is both twee and picture-postcard and harsh and cruel.</p> <p>\"I remember we went to see Road [Jim Cart-wright's acclaimed 1986 play] on a London trip from Bretton Hall. It was a promenade performance, and I actually got quite caught up in it,\" Pemberton recalls. \"We went back the next day to speak to the actors. They had been playing skinheads and were all, 'Let's get pissed tonight. There's dust in my knickers and poverty wants me', and we came into the theatre and they were like, 'Can I bum a ciggy off someone?' I thought, 'God, they were putting it on.' And then you became aware of these dreadful John Godber clich\u00e9s, and that has become a real bugbear.\"</p> <p>It has become such a bugbear that the League have written a sketch for the stage show (it also features in their book), featuring the Legz Akimbo Theatre Company, called Scumbelina - it begins in a \"northern\" living room and ends by asking the question, \"Who made us this way?\" to which the answer provided is, \"Willy Russell, John Godber, Jim Cartwright.\"</p> <p>Gatiss relates a story to illustrate their point. \"There was a BBC2 winter launch [for the League's new series] in December 1999, and they had done a trailer, which is always a source of concern to us, especially when it's done by monkeys. So a clip of the show came on in this lump of other stuff and, despite the great music the show has, they had put a brass band soundtrack on it. Because it was from 'up north'. We were appalled, because we hate that kind of thing. It had been put in a little box as 'the new northern one'.\"</p> <p>\"There was a brilliant bit in Alan Bennett's diaries, when he recalls when he was rung up about Thatcher's resignation,\" Gatiss continues. \"He said something, and when it was printed, all the aitches were systematically dropped. He says he was glad it didn't say, 'Eee, A'm reet glad she slung 'er hook.'\"</p> <p>Shearsmith: \"Having said that, a fair proportion of the audience think it's set in Wales.\"</p> <p>Gatiss: \"It's the Welsh accents.\"</p> <p>Pemberton, as is often the case, turns serious. \"Our intention was to create a believable place that just had this twist that all our characters have,\" he says. \"They are rooted in real people, sometimes literally. If the characters were totally outlandish with no trace of humanity, they become stereotypes or funny-catchphrase types. Having trained as actors, you want to invest the characters with a little more than that. That's why the town is more than just a place where the characters live. We've all grown up in places like that with just that little twist and we're aware of what they are like.\"</p> <p>Born in 1969, Reece Shearsmith grew up in Hull. where he used to decapitate his Action Men. \"Is that the kind of thing you're after?\" he asks. \"And my mum hit me in the face with a shovel when I was five. Well, I ran into it, actually. I think it was because I thought I was getting a Curly Wurly. I've still got the scar. It's still got coal dust in it that never came out.\"</p> <p>He says he was a teacher's pet, and tried to be funny to make the bad boys like him. \"It didn't really work,\" he admits. \"There was one particular boy who bullied me and once he viciously kneed me in the knackers. In French - with Miss Kemp - I tried to be horrible to get in with them, and she took me outside and said, 'No', so my one attempt to be part of the gang failed.\"</p> <p>Instead of persevering with applications for gang membership, he used to sit inside and read. \"I'm quite a good drawer, too - I was going to do art, and this drama thing was last-minute - so I used to draw my own cartoons. I still do. I never used to play out a lot.\"</p> <p>It was always the same, he says. \"Curtains drawn, Robinson Crusoe or The Singing Ringing Tree on the television, drawing and your mum coming in saying, 'Why don't you go out? They've come for you.'\"</p> <p>\"Lovely sunny day,\" Pemberton chimes in mumsy tones. \"And you've got the curtains shut!\"</p> <p>\"Morbid!\" Gatiss pronounces. \"That was the abiding word of my childhood.\"</p> <p>Gatiss, now 34, grew up in County Durham opposite a Victorian psychiatric hospital where his parents used to work. \"I had never really given it a second thought until one of my friends came to see me when I was 16. He was really spooked. I had been used to it and some of my best friends were absolutely out of their minds. It was natural, in a gothic kind of way.\"</p> <p>He was never bullied, but was always silly at school. \"I look upon The League of Gentlemen as our revenge on double PE. Those boys who walked around the football pitch talking about films instead of getting the football leathered in their faces have been vindicated. We've ploughed our furrow for years, and finally it has worked out.\"</p> <p>Dyson, who was born in Leeds in 1966, agrees. \"We are the living embodiment of every accusation that was slung at us: 'You'll never make anything of yourself because you sit on your arse watching television all day.' We have succeeded precisely because we did sit on our arses and watch television all day.\"</p> <p>Dyson is the only Gentleman who doesn't perform - \"Our stuff is so character-based that it requires good actors, and I'm simply not one. I confine myself to writing, though I do try and get on-screen at every available opportunity\" - and he had quite an unremarkable childhood, he says. \"I went to Leeds Grammar School, which was a third-rate fee-paying school. It was a very unimaginative place, and I was never encouraged to do anything creative, so I did all that after school. I grew up loving comedy, and I discovered Monty Python when I was about seven. I wasn't supposed to watch it, but I sneaked down and did. I fell in love with the records, I used to play the albums to death, put them on to tape, reproduce sketches and then do my own sketches.\"</p> <p>Dyson then graduated to creating The Goat Book, a school jotter filled with crude cartoons and caricatures, spoof TV programmes and illustrations of the rudeness that passes for the daily thoughts of 13-year-old boys.</p> <p>While he was doing this, over in County Durham Gatiss was writing out the Hackenthorpe Book Of Lies, inspired by Monty Python's Book. \"I compiled a whole book of lies. I loved doing the spines,\" he says. Shearsmith, meanwhile, was making up volumes of imagined dodges perpetrated by Roger. \"You remember, in the cartoon, he had books of all the dodges he had done?\"</p> <p>Steve Pemberton was born in Blackburn in 1967, and grew up around Chorley. He says he has \"nothing to tell, other than that, from an early age, I loved performing and dressing up. When my grandma or grandad came round, I used to love putting their coats and hats on and getting a huge laugh.\"</p> <p>He, too, loved staying in and watching as much television as he could. He would also make comics and books - \"I did like football, though\". When he got a portable TV for the bedroom he shared with his brother, they would watch the horror double bills on Saturday nights. \"We'd be close enough to switch it off if they came in, but it was one of those TVs that took five or six seconds for the picture to fade away.\" And then there were the video nasties: \"We would go to the video library and ask how many killings were in a film and what were the best ones. We saw I Spit On Your Grave, but I remember I couldn't watch The Exorcist - I had to leave the room I was so frightened. We used to watch Theatre Of Blood over and over again, fast forwarding through the acting and just watch the killings. Which are every five minutes, after all.\"</p> <p>Gatiss also had a penchant for horror films. His first, at five, was Brides Of Dracula. \"I remember Peter Cushing moving the windmill's sails into the shape of a cross to destroy Baron Meinster,\" he says fondly, before relating how his obsession informed his schoolwork. \"My essays would start like, 'A day at the beach', but then giant squid would appear...\"</p> <p>After discussing the Dick Smith Horror Make-Up Set, which they each possessed (\"He did the make-up on The Godfather and The Exorcist, and you poured the latex into moulds and all the scars were wonderful for about a second until they dried and became as hard as glass\"), the League are unanimous: \"Any kids at that age seek that kind of thrill - we wanted to be scared,\" says Pemberton. \"I don't think we are unique, but we've remembered and channelled it.\"</p> <p>Indeed they did. So, when Pemberton says that he wants things he's written to make audiences feel the way he felt when he watched The Wicker Man and Don't Look Now, both League favourites, you understand how perfectly and precisely they have channelled those childhood experiences. \"You watched the film for 90 minutes, and in the last five, 10 minutes the rug is completely pulled out from under your feet. I found that completely terrifying.\"</p> <p>The first record Shearsmith ever bought was the theme to the Hammer House Of Horror films. \"And Nelly The Elephant. I thought that was really sinister.\" Most of us wheel out such collective memories only when reminiscing down the pub - Chorlton &amp; The Wheelies! Chitty Chitty Bang Bang's Child Catcher! The vortex in The Adventure Game! - and The League of Gentlemen, too, only gradually decided to hone and polish theirs, and then to put them on stage. Previously, Gatiss and Dyson had been writing together, even penning a sitcom that they gave to Charlie Higson to have a look at. Today, they have just written an episode of the Higson- produced Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased).</p> <p>\"I met him once at a signing in Waterstone's when he was promoting one of his crime novels in 1993,\" says Dyson. \"We had written this spoof Avengers thing called The Correctors, and I plucked up the courage and asked him to have a look at it. I didn't hear anything for three months, then he wrote back with this amazing, detailed letter, a four- or five-page breakdown of how good he thought it was, what worked and what didn't. Now that people send me things, I know what a nice thing it is for someone to sit down and do that. It was very encouraging.\"</p> <p>Pemberton, meanwhile, had founded a theatre company, as Shearsmith fattened up his CV with acting and writing.</p> <p>Thanks to a friend who had a slot to fill in on the comedy fringe, the quartet got together for their first show in 1994. The result was a five-night run at the Cockpit Theatre, London. Even Dyson performed. After that, the League found themselves at a crossroads. \"It wasn't until the opportunity presented itself with a real theatre and a real slot that it became a real thing,\" says Pemberton. \"We learned that you can talk about something for two years, but if you're going to do it, you have to book something. After these five days, we spent a year talking about how we should carry it on, without actually carrying it on. Then we decided to book somewhere and do it.\"</p> <p>So they booked the Canal Cafe Theatre in London every Monday night for three months, knowing that, to bring an audience back, they had to change the material. Each week, they would alter a quarter of the material and by the end of a month they had a whole new show. \"That's where a lot of the narratives in the first series came from,\" says Shearsmith. \"We worked like mad for six months writing loads and loads of material, and we've been using it ever since.\"</p> <p>\"The Christmas special was probably the first thing completely written for television,\" adds Pemberton, \"whereas parts of the first and second series we'd written before.\"</p> <p>Right from the outset, they attracted loyal fans from what Dyson calls \"a surprisingly wide demographic\". \"The first regular fans we had were this very respectable family,\" he continues. \"The father, who was probably in his 50s, was a headteacher at a private school, and he used to bring his 18-year-old kids and his wife along. They lived in Shropshire or somewhere, and they saw one of the first shows in Edinburgh and came to the Canal Cafe three or four times. We were bemused. Then we noticed we'd be getting young people in, people your parents' age in. When you're playing big venues, you really notice it.\" (And you really do notice it: on the recent tour that culminates in the West End run, the audience has been extraordinarily diverse, from older women to young gay skinheads.)</p> <p>Then, in 1996, the quartet took what they call \"our first big leap of faith\". They took themselves to the Edinburgh Festival, where they promoted their show in a tiny space at the Pleasance. The next year, with a radio show already in the bag, they won the Perrier. \"We were always slightly outside the whole comedy thing because it was very stand-up based,\" says Pemberton. \"Everyone seemed to be with an agent or a promoter, and we didn't have anyone backing us, no one knew us, so it was a real stamp of approval. When you've done it all yourself, you haven't had anyone helping you, it was very nice that people liked it.\"</p> <p>\"I think the Perrier is the best award we've won just from the way it felt on the night,\" adds Shearsmith. \"We've won a lot of awards since then, but that was a real feeling of being recognised.\"</p> <p>\"And,\" Gatiss concludes, grinning cheekily, \"anyone who carps about awards should wait till they win one. It changes your entire attitude towards them, I discovered.\"</p> <p>Initially, the foursome wrote together for the League, but now they write in pairs - Dyson and Gatiss, Pemberton and Shearsmith. They say writing and performing are intertwined, because they know who they are writing for. They constantly rewrite and, sometimes, when they rehearse - a relic of their Bretton Hall training, says Gatiss - they become much more aware of what needs to be said and what doesn't. \"You know you don't need a joke every three lines. You know something might be funny even though it doesn't look funny on the page.\"</p> <p>\"Our scripts don't look funny on the page,\" one of the others notes deadpan. Of course, some would say they aren't funny on television, either. The League of Gentlemen are undoubtedly an acquired taste, and some viewers may baulk at their forays into politically incorrect humour. While the TV show is extremely popular, the League are first to admit that they haven't made the leap into the mainstream like The Royle Family, say. Nor are they likely to. \"We've done this big tour, but no one would know we had done it apart from the people who'd seen it,\" says Shearsmith.</p> <p>Gatiss, who seems bemused that Room 101, by contrast, easily gets five million viewers, adds, \"So many people have never heard of us... I'd love to think we could move to BBC1, but I'd like to think the channel could change around us. Which I think it is. Who would have thought that The Royle Family would be the nation's favourite sitcom. When it started, it was such a risk, and now it's a Christmas Day fixture. We'd never be interested in doing it if they said we'd have to tone it down. What would be the point? If it was totally compromised, it's not what we do.\"</p> <p>The League have always had a firm belief in what they were doing, adds Dyson, though they never thought it had anything to do with whether it was going to be successful or not. \"Up until then, it seemed quite arbitrary - when you see stuff on telly that you don't like, you wonder why it's on at all. So even when the first series started to go out, even though we were very proud of it, we weren't necessarily convinced it would take off in a huge way. By then, we thought we would find an audience, but really it wasn't until we went on tour that we realised how popular it was.\"</p> <p>To give you some idea of The League of Gentlemen's popularity and their critical kudos, consider that they won a Sony Silver Award for their radio show, On The Town With The League Of Gentlemen, as well as that Perrier, a Royal Television Society award, the Golden Rose of Montreux in 1999, and a Bafta for Best Comedy in 2000. On their recent tour, they have played to full houses from Edinburgh southwards, including a crowd of 4,800 at Birmingham NEC. The video of the League's first series sold some 100,000 copies.</p> <p>Despite Gatiss dropping and breaking his Bafta on the tube (\"It fell out of the bag like a monster\") and the BBC confiscating their Golden Rose at the airport (\"They said they were going to make us tin ones,\" Pemberton says. \"I imagine them being like Take Hart - folding wire and spraying it with gold paint - but they never materialised.\"), that wishing stone at Rottingdean seems to have done the trick. \"If I could go back and visit my nine-year-old self and tell me what I'd be doing when I was 34, I would have exploded with disbelief and excitement,\" says Dyson.</p> <p>But with such success comes pressure. Not that the four haven't experienced it already. Gatiss once opened mail for Rolf Harris's Cartoon Time (\"At that time, it was bigger than anything in the world. It was extraordinary: thousands and thousands of children writing in\") and, Shearsmith says, forged Rolf's signature for the kids. \"They think they've got Rolf's, but they don't.\"</p> <p>But the \"difficult\" third series syndrome is something else. Added to that, The League of Gentlemen is also taking off abroad. It is already huge in Poland and Scandinavia, and has a cult following in America, too. \"When we first started out, we were like, 'Can you imagine if we had our own TV series?' and I can't believe we are now talking about doing our third,\" says Shearsmith. \"We have to consolidate and be as funny. We know only too well the 'third series is rubbish' syndrome, and you realise it is difficult because it is really hard to do.\"</p> <p>\"And,\" Gatiss offers, \"people forget that John Cleese and Connie Booth took four years to write each series of Fawlty Towers, and that's why it's the best thing ever made.\"</p> <p>Whatever, the League won't begin work proper on the third series until April. \"More and more we are veering into narrative,\u00d3 reveals Dyson.</p> <p>\"We all enjoyed having the space to tell the stories we did in the Christmas special, and I think it is the best thing we've done. You do sketches for so long and they can begin to feel a bit limiting, particularly when it is so character-driven. The natural thing to do with character is cement it to a narrative. We haven't resolved how we will make that work, or what the stories will be. That is still to come.\u00d3</p> <p>In the meantime, they have the stage show with which to occupy themselves. It is a riotous blend of new material and more familiar sketches from the TV show. The first half sees the League return to their roots (\"It's a theatrical revue,\u00d3 Pemberton says defiantly), while the second half is a trip to Royston Vasey with the three performing Gentlemen playing 45 characters in all.</p> <p>\"We don't want it to be another TV show doing the cash-in stage show,\u00d3 says Pemberton, who has now hit his stride after initially seeming quite awkward. \"We want theatre critics to see it because there are references to Sondheim, Jean Genet, Shakespeare and Jim Cartwright. It's very theatrical. As well as having lots of wanking jokes.\u00d3 The League share a conspiratorial smile.</p> <p>Then it is time for photographs, something none of them enjoys. \"Not as ourselves, anyway,\u00d3 Shearsmith grimaces. Before braving the camera, Gatiss produces a copy of the Department of Social Security's in-house newsletter. On page 6, there is a photo of Pauline, Ross and Mickey. It is there to illustrate how a new initiative works better than Pauline's fascistic approach, which she bases on her knowledge of pens: \"If they don't work, you shake them, and if they still don't work, you chuck them away.\u00d3</p> <p>\"My sister-in-law works for the DSS,\u00d3 he explains. \"She sent it to me.\u00d3 The boys are very impressed, oohing and aahing as if they are all of 12.</p> <p>And then they are off. Pemberton, whose heart attack in Germany at 25 inspired the birth of Herr Lipp (\"The hospital chaplain gave me a beige towel on Christmas Day\u00d3); Dyson, who was forced to touch an electric fence when he was young by a gang of bad boys; Shearsmith, who once went to an orphan's birthday party and blew out the candles by mistake; and Gatiss, who was the boy next door - if you lived in a psychiatric hospital. They have places to go and people to see. One more photograph for the road. \u00d0You're going to hate this one,\u00d3 the photographer warns them. \"Bare arses?\u00d3 Gatiss guesses, a bit too excited at the prospect. Normal, like Tubbs and Edward, is relative</p> <p>\u0095 The League Of Gentlemen's A Local Show For Local People plays Mon-Sat from March 12 for three weeks at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, 020-7494 5000.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Once upon a time, in the seaside town of Rottingdean, there was a wishing stone. One day, some six years ago, four men visiting the town solicited good luck from the stone shortly before they went into a shop looking for fossils. \"I collect fossils, so we went into this shop looking for trilobites,\" one of the men explains. \"It was full of snowstorms and seaside junk, and the woman behind the counter was really defensive. She never said anything, but she looked at us as though one of us was going to steal something. After we left, we joked about her saying something like \"I have a husband upstairs\" or \"I have guns\" to scare us.\" Whether the woman in the Rottingdean shop near the wishing stone killed strangers, ate hair sandwiches and danced naked in the moonlight remains unclear. She would, after all, become the inspiration for one of the quartet's greatest creations: the murderous, incestuous and porcine owners of Royston Vasey's Local Shop - 'for local people' - whose stock of Precious Things includes tinned peaches, carbolic soap, bundles of sticks, James Hadley Chase novels and, of course, snowstorms. The potency of the wishing stone, on the other hand, seems apparent: \"I really did wish that we could get to Edinburgh and the show really took off,\" recalls one of the men. \"And now you've remembered it, the spell will be broken,\" another adds ominously. \"You shouldn't have said it out loud,\" sighs another, narrowing his eyes. I half-expect the sky to blacken and lightning to rip across it, even though it's 11 o'clock on a bright Wednesday morning. The League of Gentlemen have that effect. They look so normal, too. Mark Gatiss is a tall, warm-hearted chap who carries a battered, brown briefcase. He could be an academic. Reece Shearsmith looks like your sister's boyfriend, and is wearing natty Camper shoes. Steve Pemberton apologises profusely for being late, something to do with trains or buses. And Jeremy Dyson reminds me of my lawyer cousin Andrew, who, for a while, built Daleks out of cardboard and stuck split peas on the sides to emulate the rivets. Sitting in the office of the producer of their tour - A Local Show For Local People, which next month starts a three-week run in London - the fossil- collecting Gatiss proudly recounts how one review of their first series said that the Local Shop says more about modern Britain than anything in Bill Bryson's Notes From A Small Island. \"It's the universality of it,\" he adds. \"It's not just a northern town, because people will say, 'Ooh, Wales is like that', or 'I know someone like that from Sussex'. Plus, it has done terribly well abroad, so the Local Shop particularly, and the town in general, must say something about those countries, too. There is some element of Royston Vasey in everyone.\" Which would be a worrying thought, given that Royston Vasey is populated by murderers and monsters, sadists and saddos, freaks and fetishists, and maybe even cannibals. An everyday tale of country folks it ain't. The characters that The League of Gentlemen have created range from the Rottingdean-inspired Tubbs and Edward, who run the Local Shop, through Babs, the pre-transsexual cab driver ('with nipples like bullets') to Hillary Briss, the black-hearted butcher who trades in 'special stuff'. They have introduced an unsuspecting public to the misanthropic Reverend Bernice Woodall, who conceals contraband cigarettes in the confession booths; the toad-obsessed, anal-retentive Denton family; Pauline Campbell Jones, scourge of the unemployed, despite the fact that she's a restart officer; and the chilling ringmaster, Papa Lazarou, whose shibboleth, 'You're my wife now, Dave', makes no sense whatsoever, but is knicker-wettingly frightening nonetheless. It is difficult to categorise a show about such people simply as comedy, as Dyson readily admits: \"Sketches about a grief-stricken cave guide haunted by a tragic accident on a school trip, or about a German homosexual exchange teacher are not the stuff of Russ Abbott's Madhouse.\" Nor is the League's frame of reference typical in contemporary British comedy. Their shows have an incredible pedigree, with nods to comedy, horror, melodrama, literature and comic books. In their cracking Christmas special alone, there were references to a host of books and films, from the familiar Salem's Lot, Eyes Wide Shut and The Railway Children, to the more obscure, such as the Ealing thriller Dead Of Night and WW Jacobs' The Monkey's Paw. Their blend of gothic drama and gallows humour has led to comparisons with everything from Monty Python to Twin Peaks, and seen them described as Tod Browning meets Peak Practice - Freak Practice, if you will. But, in the end, The League of Gentlemen are simply The League of Gentlemen: comparisons and descriptions are futile. Perverse geniuses, they have to be seen to be believed. The Brothers Grimmer. All of this you will already know if you've seen the television show. You'll also know that Royston Vasey and its idiosyncratic inhabitants have caught the strangeness of Britain - its insularity, hypocrisies and freakishness - in gloriously minute detail. You may even be planning to join the hardcore fans' pilgrimage to Hadfield, Derbyshire, where the TV show is filmed (costume is optional) or logging on to one of the burgeoning websites and chat groups. If you haven't seen The League of Gentlemen, however, all of this will mean absolutely nothing to you. And you really should stay in more. Gatiss, Pemberton and Shearsmith met while studying drama at Bretton Hall College in Wakefield. \"We bonded over Brecht,\" says Gatiss, initially the most genial of the three. \"Steve and I were in the same year, and they had put up the photos of the new intake, one of whom was Reece. We were laughing, not just at his photo but at his name, too. We thought 'Reece Shearsmith' was like a Little Lord Fauntleroy character.\" \"I think the first time we met, we were doing a musical production of The Taming Of The Shrew,\" Pemberton recalls. \"Not Kiss Me Kate - that would have made sense - but it was a sung-through version of the play. It was absolutely dreadful.\" At the same time, Gatiss was introduced to Dyson, who was studying philosophy in Leeds, by a mutual friend. \"The guy I shared a flat with when we left school went to Bretton Hall to do drama, and in his first or second week he rang me and said I had to meet this bloke because he was just like me,\" says Dyson. \"Normally, I cringe when people say that: it's a recipe for disaster. I met him and resisted liking him for half an hour, but as soon as he started talking about the lost John Inman sitcom I had been trying to remember the name of for three years - it was around for one season in 1977 and was set in a factory - I knew we were destined to get on.\" (It took Gatiss and Dyson another three years to find out that the sitcom was called Odd Man Out.) Through Gatiss, Dyson met Pemberton and Shearsmith, and it wasn't long before the four of them established collective memories and shared experiences. When I ask each of them individually to tell me about their childhoods, Pemberton smiles and says, \"It's probably the same story four times.\" \"We all watched Carry On Screaming on the same night,\" says Gatiss. \"Bonfire Night, 1976.\" Are you trying to find some childhood trauma to explain why we do The League of Gentlemen? Shearsmith eyes me suspiciously. \"I don't remember any savage incident that would turn me into what you think I am.\" So, I ask, you're just four northern lads with typical childhoods? They bristle at the N word. \"We always get 'four northern lads',\" says Reece. \"If we were from anywhere else, no one would say 'four southern lads'.\" He is right, but perhaps in a comedy landscape that is more commonly the habitat of Oxbridge types, their northernness really is seen as a break from the norm. Whatever, they get annoyed at the fetishisation of the north (of England) as a place that is both twee and picture-postcard and harsh and cruel. \"I remember we went to see Road [Jim Cart-wright's acclaimed 1986 play] on a London trip from Bretton Hall. It was a promenade performance, and I actually got quite caught up in it,\" Pemberton recalls. \"We went back the next day to speak to the actors. They had been playing skinheads and were all, 'Let's get pissed tonight. There's dust in my knickers and poverty wants me', and we came into the theatre and they were like, 'Can I bum a ciggy off someone?' I thought, 'God, they were putting it on.' And then you became aware of these dreadful John Godber clich\u00e9s, and that has become a real bugbear.\" It has become such a bugbear that the League have written a sketch for the stage show (it also features in their book), featuring the Legz Akimbo Theatre Company, called Scumbelina - it begins in a \"northern\" living room and ends by asking the question, \"Who made us this way?\" to which the answer provided is, \"Willy Russell, John Godber, Jim Cartwright.\" Gatiss relates a story to illustrate their point. \"There was a BBC2 winter launch [for the League's new series] in December 1999, and they had done a trailer, which is always a source of concern to us, especially when it's done by monkeys. So a clip of the show came on in this lump of other stuff and, despite the great music the show has, they had put a brass band soundtrack on it. Because it was from 'up north'. We were appalled, because we hate that kind of thing. It had been put in a little box as 'the new northern one'.\" \"There was a brilliant bit in Alan Bennett's diaries, when he recalls when he was rung up about Thatcher's resignation,\" Gatiss continues. \"He said something, and when it was printed, all the aitches were systematically dropped. He says he was glad it didn't say, 'Eee, A'm reet glad she slung 'er hook.'\" Shearsmith: \"Having said that, a fair proportion of the audience think it's set in Wales.\" Gatiss: \"It's the Welsh accents.\" Pemberton, as is often the case, turns serious. \"Our intention was to create a believable place that just had this twist that all our characters have,\" he says. \"They are rooted in real people, sometimes literally. If the characters were totally outlandish with no trace of humanity, they become stereotypes or funny-catchphrase types. Having trained as actors, you want to invest the characters with a little more than that. That's why the town is more than just a place where the characters live. We've all grown up in places like that with just that little twist and we're aware of what they are like.\" Born in 1969, Reece Shearsmith grew up in Hull. where he used to decapitate his Action Men. \"Is that the kind of thing you're after?\" he asks. \"And my mum hit me in the face with a shovel when I was five. Well, I ran into it, actually. I think it was because I thought I was getting a Curly Wurly. I've still got the scar. It's still got coal dust in it that never came out.\" He says he was a teacher's pet, and tried to be funny to make the bad boys like him. \"It didn't really work,\" he admits. \"There was one particular boy who bullied me and once he viciously kneed me in the knackers. In French - with Miss Kemp - I tried to be horrible to get in with them, and she took me outside and said, 'No', so my one attempt to be part of the gang failed.\" Instead of persevering with applications for gang membership, he used to sit inside and read. \"I'm quite a good drawer, too - I was going to do art, and this drama thing was last-minute - so I used to draw my own cartoons. I still do. I never used to play out a lot.\" It was always the same, he says. \"Curtains drawn, Robinson Crusoe or The Singing Ringing Tree on the television, drawing and your mum coming in saying, 'Why don't you go out? They've come for you.'\" \"Lovely sunny day,\" Pemberton chimes in mumsy tones. \"And you've got the curtains shut!\" \"Morbid!\" Gatiss pronounces. \"That was the abiding word of my childhood.\" Gatiss, now 34, grew up in County Durham opposite a Victorian psychiatric hospital where his parents used to work. \"I had never really given it a second thought until one of my friends came to see me when I was 16. He was really spooked. I had been used to it and some of my best friends were absolutely out of their minds. It was natural, in a gothic kind of way.\" He was never bullied, but was always silly at school. \"I look upon The League of Gentlemen as our revenge on double PE. Those boys who walked around the football pitch talking about films instead of getting the football leathered in their faces have been vindicated. We've ploughed our furrow for years, and finally it has worked out.\" Dyson, who was born in Leeds in 1966, agrees. \"We are the living embodiment of every accusation that was slung at us: 'You'll never make anything of yourself because you sit on your arse watching television all day.' We have succeeded precisely because we did sit on our arses and watch television all day.\" Dyson is the only Gentleman who doesn't perform - \"Our stuff is so character-based that it requires good actors, and I'm simply not one. I confine myself to writing, though I do try and get on-screen at every available opportunity\" - and he had quite an unremarkable childhood, he says. \"I went to Leeds Grammar School, which was a third-rate fee-paying school. It was a very unimaginative place, and I was never encouraged to do anything creative, so I did all that after school. I grew up loving comedy, and I discovered Monty Python when I was about seven. I wasn't supposed to watch it, but I sneaked down and did. I fell in love with the records, I used to play the albums to death, put them on to tape, reproduce sketches and then do my own sketches.\" Dyson then graduated to creating The Goat Book, a school jotter filled with crude cartoons and caricatures, spoof TV programmes and illustrations of the rudeness that passes for the daily thoughts of 13-year-old boys. While he was doing this, over in County Durham Gatiss was writing out the Hackenthorpe Book Of Lies, inspired by Monty Python's Book. \"I compiled a whole book of lies. I loved doing the spines,\" he says. Shearsmith, meanwhile, was making up volumes of imagined dodges perpetrated by Roger. \"You remember, in the cartoon, he had books of all the dodges he had done?\" Steve Pemberton was born in Blackburn in 1967, and grew up around Chorley. He says he has \"nothing to tell, other than that, from an early age, I loved performing and dressing up. When my grandma or grandad came round, I used to love putting their coats and hats on and getting a huge laugh.\" He, too, loved staying in and watching as much television as he could. He would also make comics and books - \"I did like football, though\". When he got a portable TV for the bedroom he shared with his brother, they would watch the horror double bills on Saturday nights. \"We'd be close enough to switch it off if they came in, but it was one of those TVs that took five or six seconds for the picture to fade away.\" And then there were the video nasties: \"We would go to the video library and ask how many killings were in a film and what were the best ones. We saw I Spit On Your Grave, but I remember I couldn't watch The Exorcist - I had to leave the room I was so frightened. We used to watch Theatre Of Blood over and over again, fast forwarding through the acting and just watch the killings. Which are every five minutes, after all.\" Gatiss also had a penchant for horror films. His first, at five, was Brides Of Dracula. \"I remember Peter Cushing moving the windmill's sails into the shape of a cross to destroy Baron Meinster,\" he says fondly, before relating how his obsession informed his schoolwork. \"My essays would start like, 'A day at the beach', but then giant squid would appear...\" After discussing the Dick Smith Horror Make-Up Set, which they each possessed (\"He did the make-up on The Godfather and The Exorcist, and you poured the latex into moulds and all the scars were wonderful for about a second until they dried and became as hard as glass\"), the League are unanimous: \"Any kids at that age seek that kind of thrill - we wanted to be scared,\" says Pemberton. \"I don't think we are unique, but we've remembered and channelled it.\" Indeed they did. So, when Pemberton says that he wants things he's written to make audiences feel the way he felt when he watched The Wicker Man and Don't Look Now, both League favourites, you understand how perfectly and precisely they have channelled those childhood experiences. \"You watched the film for 90 minutes, and in the last five, 10 minutes the rug is completely pulled out from under your feet. I found that completely terrifying.\" The first record Shearsmith ever bought was the theme to the Hammer House Of Horror films. \"And Nelly The Elephant. I thought that was really sinister.\" Most of us wheel out such collective memories only when reminiscing down the pub - Chorlton &amp; The Wheelies! Chitty Chitty Bang Bang's Child Catcher! The vortex in The Adventure Game! - and The League of Gentlemen, too, only gradually decided to hone and polish theirs, and then to put them on stage. Previously, Gatiss and Dyson had been writing together, even penning a sitcom that they gave to Charlie Higson to have a look at. Today, they have just written an episode of the Higson- produced Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased). \"I met him once at a signing in Waterstone's when he was promoting one of his crime novels in 1993,\" says Dyson. \"We had written this spoof Avengers thing called The Correctors, and I plucked up the courage and asked him to have a look at it. I didn't hear anything for three months, then he wrote back with this amazing, detailed letter, a four- or five-page breakdown of how good he thought it was, what worked and what didn't. Now that people send me things, I know what a nice thing it is for someone to sit down and do that. It was very encouraging.\" Pemberton, meanwhile, had founded a theatre company, as Shearsmith fattened up his CV with acting and writing. Thanks to a friend who had a slot to fill in on the comedy fringe, the quartet got together for their first show in 1994. The result was a five-night run at the Cockpit Theatre, London. Even Dyson performed. After that, the League found themselves at a crossroads. \"It wasn't until the opportunity presented itself with a real theatre and a real slot that it became a real thing,\" says Pemberton. \"We learned that you can talk about something for two years, but if you're going to do it, you have to book something. After these five days, we spent a year talking about how we should carry it on, without actually carrying it on. Then we decided to book somewhere and do it.\" So they booked the Canal Cafe Theatre in London every Monday night for three months, knowing that, to bring an audience back, they had to change the material. Each week, they would alter a quarter of the material and by the end of a month they had a whole new show. \"That's where a lot of the narratives in the first series came from,\" says Shearsmith. \"We worked like mad for six months writing loads and loads of material, and we've been using it ever since.\" \"The Christmas special was probably the first thing completely written for television,\" adds Pemberton, \"whereas parts of the first and second series we'd written before.\" Right from the outset, they attracted loyal fans from what Dyson calls \"a surprisingly wide demographic\". \"The first regular fans we had were this very respectable family,\" he continues. \"The father, who was probably in his 50s, was a headteacher at a private school, and he used to bring his 18-year-old kids and his wife along. They lived in Shropshire or somewhere, and they saw one of the first shows in Edinburgh and came to the Canal Cafe three or four times. We were bemused. Then we noticed we'd be getting young people in, people your parents' age in. When you're playing big venues, you really notice it.\" (And you really do notice it: on the recent tour that culminates in the West End run, the audience has been extraordinarily diverse, from older women to young gay skinheads.) Then, in 1996, the quartet took what they call \"our first big leap of faith\". They took themselves to the Edinburgh Festival, where they promoted their show in a tiny space at the Pleasance. The next year, with a radio show already in the bag, they won the Perrier. \"We were always slightly outside the whole comedy thing because it was very stand-up based,\" says Pemberton. \"Everyone seemed to be with an agent or a promoter, and we didn't have anyone backing us, no one knew us, so it was a real stamp of approval. When you've done it all yourself, you haven't had anyone helping you, it was very nice that people liked it.\" \"I think the Perrier is the best award we've won just from the way it felt on the night,\" adds Shearsmith. \"We've won a lot of awards since then, but that was a real feeling of being recognised.\" \"And,\" Gatiss concludes, grinning cheekily, \"anyone who carps about awards should wait till they win one. It changes your entire attitude towards them, I discovered.\" Initially, the foursome wrote together for the League, but now they write in pairs - Dyson and Gatiss, Pemberton and Shearsmith. They say writing and performing are intertwined, because they know who they are writing for. They constantly rewrite and, sometimes, when they rehearse - a relic of their Bretton Hall training, says Gatiss - they become much more aware of what needs to be said and what doesn't. \"You know you don't need a joke every three lines. You know something might be funny even though it doesn't look funny on the page.\" \"Our scripts don't look funny on the page,\" one of the others notes deadpan. Of course, some would say they aren't funny on television, either. The League of Gentlemen are undoubtedly an acquired taste, and some viewers may baulk at their forays into politically incorrect humour. While the TV show is extremely popular, the League are first to admit that they haven't made the leap into the mainstream like The Royle Family, say. Nor are they likely to. \"We've done this big tour, but no one would know we had done it apart from the people who'd seen it,\" says Shearsmith. Gatiss, who seems bemused that Room 101, by contrast, easily gets five million viewers, adds, \"So many people have never heard of us... I'd love to think we could move to BBC1, but I'd like to think the channel could change around us. Which I think it is. Who would have thought that The Royle Family would be the nation's favourite sitcom. When it started, it was such a risk, and now it's a Christmas Day fixture. We'd never be interested in doing it if they said we'd have to tone it down. What would be the point? If it was totally compromised, it's not what we do.\" The League have always had a firm belief in what they were doing, adds Dyson, though they never thought it had anything to do with whether it was going to be successful or not. \"Up until then, it seemed quite arbitrary - when you see stuff on telly that you don't like, you wonder why it's on at all. So even when the first series started to go out, even though we were very proud of it, we weren't necessarily convinced it would take off in a huge way. By then, we thought we would find an audience, but really it wasn't until we went on tour that we realised how popular it was.\" To give you some idea of The League of Gentlemen's popularity and their critical kudos, consider that they won a Sony Silver Award for their radio show, On The Town With The League Of Gentlemen, as well as that Perrier, a Royal Television Society award, the Golden Rose of Montreux in 1999, and a Bafta for Best Comedy in 2000. On their recent tour, they have played to full houses from Edinburgh southwards, including a crowd of 4,800 at Birmingham NEC. The video of the League's first series sold some 100,000 copies. Despite Gatiss dropping and breaking his Bafta on the tube (\"It fell out of the bag like a monster\") and the BBC confiscating their Golden Rose at the airport (\"They said they were going to make us tin ones,\" Pemberton says. \"I imagine them being like Take Hart - folding wire and spraying it with gold paint - but they never materialised.\"), that wishing stone at Rottingdean seems to have done the trick. \"If I could go back and visit my nine-year-old self and tell me what I'd be doing when I was 34, I would have exploded with disbelief and excitement,\" says Dyson. But with such success comes pressure. Not that the four haven't experienced it already. Gatiss once opened mail for Rolf Harris's Cartoon Time (\"At that time, it was bigger than anything in the world. It was extraordinary: thousands and thousands of children writing in\") and, Shearsmith says, forged Rolf's signature for the kids. \"They think they've got Rolf's, but they don't.\" But the \"difficult\" third series syndrome is something else. Added to that, The League of Gentlemen is also taking off abroad. It is already huge in Poland and Scandinavia, and has a cult following in America, too. \"When we first started out, we were like, 'Can you imagine if we had our own TV series?' and I can't believe we are now talking about doing our third,\" says Shearsmith. \"We have to consolidate and be as funny. We know only too well the 'third series is rubbish' syndrome, and you realise it is difficult because it is really hard to do.\" \"And,\" Gatiss offers, \"people forget that John Cleese and Connie Booth took four years to write each series of Fawlty Towers, and that's why it's the best thing ever made.\" Whatever, the League won't begin work proper on the third series until April. \"More and more we are veering into narrative,\u00d3 reveals Dyson. \"We all enjoyed having the space to tell the stories we did in the Christmas special, and I think it is the best thing we've done. You do sketches for so long and they can begin to feel a bit limiting, particularly when it is so character-driven. The natural thing to do with character is cement it to a narrative. We haven't resolved how we will make that work, or what the stories will be. That is still to come.\u00d3 In the meantime, they have the stage show with which to occupy themselves. It is a riotous blend of new material and more familiar sketches from the TV show. The first half sees the League return to their roots (\"It's a theatrical revue,\u00d3 Pemberton says defiantly), while the second half is a trip to Royston Vasey with the three performing Gentlemen playing 45 characters in all. \"We don't want it to be another TV show doing the cash-in stage show,\u00d3 says Pemberton, who has now hit his stride after initially seeming quite awkward. \"We want theatre critics to see it because there are references to Sondheim, Jean Genet, Shakespeare and Jim Cartwright. It's very theatrical. As well as having lots of wanking jokes.\u00d3 The League share a conspiratorial smile. Then it is time for photographs, something none of them enjoys. \"Not as ourselves, anyway,\u00d3 Shearsmith grimaces. Before braving the camera, Gatiss produces a copy of the Department of Social Security's in-house newsletter. On page 6, there is a photo of Pauline, Ross and Mickey. It is there to illustrate how a new initiative works better than Pauline's fascistic approach, which she bases on her knowledge of pens: \"If they don't work, you shake them, and if they still don't work, you chuck them away.\u00d3 \"My sister-in-law works for the DSS,\u00d3 he explains. \"She sent it to me.\u00d3 The boys are very impressed, oohing and aahing as if they are all of 12. And then they are off. Pemberton, whose heart attack in Germany at 25 inspired the birth of Herr Lipp (\"The hospital chaplain gave me a beige towel on Christmas Day\u00d3); Dyson, who was forced to touch an electric fence when he was young by a gang of bad boys; Shearsmith, who once went to an orphan's birthday party and blew out the candles by mistake; and Gatiss, who was the boy next door - if you lived in a psychiatric hospital. They have places to go and people to see. One more photograph for the road. \u00d0You're going to hate this one,\u00d3 the photographer warns them. \"Bare arses?\u00d3 Gatiss guesses, a bit too excited at the prospect. Normal, like Tubbs and Edward, is relative \u0095 The League Of Gentlemen's A Local Show For Local People plays Mon-Sat from March 12 for three weeks at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, 020-7494 5000.",

      "body": "<p>The leading character in Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 film Blow-Up, a womanising, Bentley-driving, ineffably cool photographer, was played by David Hemmings. But even before the film was released everyone \"knew\" it was based on David Bailey. It never really mattered that the photographs used in the film - an intriguing if highly flawed siting of Italian Marxist cinematic theory in swinging London - were in fact taken by Don McCullin. </p> <p>Or that the Hemmings character was also drawn from the two other members of the East-End photographic triumvirate; Brian Duffy and Terence Donovan. Although it was Hemmings's body that sat astride the model and pushed the camera lens into her face, as far as history is concerned it was David Bailey who launched into what has become the clich\u00e9d patter of the fashion studio: \"That's great, that's great,\" he coaxed the supine girl. \"Again with the hair. Do that again. C'mon, c'mon. More, much more.\" </p> <p>That this image has proved so durable - Mike Myers recently acknowledged its part in the creation of Austin Powers - must be particularly irksome to Bailey, who claims that by the time the film was released the 60s were over; \"after 66 it was just media hype\". But equally, by that time, he had already taken some of the defining photos of the decade - the unlined face of the young Mick Jagger, the Kray twins playing with their pet snakes, the first supermodel, Jean Shrimpton, emerging from the crowd on a Manhattan street - and had become a household name. All the while his life was being lived as much before the lens as behind it. The tall, skinny, beautiful and posh women he photographed and slept with, among them Shrimpton, provided the template for contemporary cool. By the time he married the French actress Catherine Deneuve in 1967, with Mick Jagger as his best man, he was front-page news. For better or worse it was this incarnation that Antonioni sealed forever on celluloid. </p> <p>The artist Brian Clarke has known Bailey for 25 years. \"The fact that his personal history has become confused with the body of work is not helpful to the understanding of that work. But, I have no hesitation in saying he is one of the great defining photographers of our time.\" Clarke says what sets him apart, astonishingly for someone who has made a career in the fashion industry, is authenticity. \"He has no bullshit and for someone in that world it is almost unique. Of all the famous people I have known, Bailey carries fame with the least sense of burden. He knows it is meaningless and he deals with it on that level. He is neither impressed by fame nor hindered by it.\" </p> <p>David Puttnam was Bailey's agent in the mid-60s. Puttnam says: \"To his immense credit he hasn't changed at all. He still has all the same strengths and all the same weaknesses he ever had. He genuinely loves photography. He still gets excited by the equipment and the process and the technology as well as the images.\" Photo historian Martin Harrison worked with Bailey on his huge 1999 retrospective book Archive One and has curated several major exhibitions of his work. \"He hates his association with the 60s because he is still working now. Most artists don't want to talk about their old stuff because they are producing new stuff all the time. He is associated with this glamorous 60s thing. But it's not like he took a dive in 69.\" </p> <p>Indeed Bailey has been working solidly ever since and has amassed a vast body of work. \"But I don't really look at my old stuff and don't really think about it that much,\" he says. \"I made a movie in 1999 [The Intruder] and I've never really seen the finished version on a screen.\" Instead he throws himself into a dizzying schedule of new projects. Recently a day trip to Helsinki was immediately followed by four days in South Africa. In the previous nine months he had been to New York eight times, LA twice, Japan, India, the Philippines, as well as \"many\" trips to Spain and France. He also does portrait photography for a prince in Saudi Arabia - \"but I always charge more or less the same no matter who they are; once you try and get too clever you get your knickers in a twist\" - and says the travel is not too bad because a lot of it is on private planes. But most of his work is done in London anyway, although 85% is for overseas consumption. </p> <p>This has been the routine for 40 years, and the result is not only some of the finest fashion and portrait photography of the period, but also nearly 500 commercials - the current one for Orange mobile phones showing hands imprinted with orange squares is his - books, documentaries, exhibitions and films. As far back as 1966 he directed a film, GG Passion, about a rock star being hounded to death by his fans - it was partly funded by Roman Polanski, who also introduced him to Catherine Deneuve - and as recently as 1999 he directed a low budget, noirish thriller, The Intruder, staring Nastassja Kinski and Charlotte Gainsbourg </p> <p>Brian Clarke says there is no mystery as to why, now aged 63, Bailey keeps going so hard: \"He's an artist. Artists always keep going.\" Indeed, despite working throughout his career in a profoundly commercial arena, he has been respected as an artist almost from the beginning. There was a full-scale exhibition of his work in the National Portrait Gallery as far back as 1971, and the V&amp;A has also held a major show. The NPG first bought his work in 1972 - a portrait of Julie Christie - and in 1988 commissioned him to photograph Princess Diana. Bailey acknowledges the irony in this: as a child, \"photography was something you did once a year on Margate Beach\". </p> <p>He was born in Leytonstone 1938 in the next street to where one of his heroes, Alfred Hitchcock, was born. He's always said that his main influence was the cinema and not other photographers. \"The only cultural thing I had in the East End was the cinema. We went there because it was cheaper than putting a shilling in the gas. We'd go seven nights a week sometimes. I was already taking pictures before I even saw work by Irvine Penn or Bill Brandt.\" </p> <p>The family moved to East Ham when he was three, after their house was damaged by a Luft waffe bomb. He has one younger sister, Thelma, and says he was brought up by his mother and his aunt Dolly, \"everyone had an Aunt Dolly in the East End.\" He hardly ever saw his father, a tailor's cutter, describing him as a bit of a Jack the Lad. \"My mother and father sort of split up and my father wasn't interested in what I did. I never liked him but I was probably conditioned by my mother not to like him. I was hers and my sister was more his. I don't think he liked me but I never really saw him that much.\" </p> <p>Despite his association with the East End, as a child he was not stereotypical. He disliked football, liked bird-watching and at 10 stopped eating meat. \"My father thought I was fucking queer, but queer didn't mean homosexual. In those days it just meant a bit of an oddball.\" He was also different in that he was an undiagnosed dyslexic. \"I knew I was smarter than the teachers,\" he recalls, \"but they thought I was an idiot and I used to get the cane for not being able to spell and all that kind of thing.\" He now says that while the idea of him being a visual rather than a literary person cannot all be ascribed to his dyslexia, he acknowledges that it definitely pushed him in that direction. The only subject he was any good at was drawing. He still paints and produces about six pieces a year, mostly for his own pleasure although he has sold \"a few\" including two works to New York artist Julian Schnabel. </p> <p>When he was 14 or 15 he started to go to dance halls and learned about the local gang culture. \"The Krays, the Barking Boys and the Canning Town Boys were the three gangs at the time. They weren't gangsters, they were just hooligans. They just went around beating people up if you looked at them wrong in a dance hall. I got beat up by the Barking Boys because I danced with one of their girlfriends. They left me in the doorway of Times Furnishing.\" </p> <p>A dozen years later his photos of the Krays were a key element in building both his and their reputations. It added to his cachet as a product of that world and provided them with some of the recognition they craved. The writer Francis Wyndham, who was working for Queen magazine and the Sunday Times, made the introduction and arranged for the photographs to be taken. \"I had a very na\u00efve idea for doing something about gangsters so I wrote round to them all and only the Krays replied,\" Wyndham recalls. \"They'd just successfully sued the Mirror for libel and had just got off some charges so they felt on top of the world. I've often wished I'd had a tiny percentage of those photographs. Bailey was their ideal person. They really respected him because he was from the same place as them but had won his success and fame legally.\" </p> <p>Bailey's first exposure to photography was, \"mucking around with the chemicals, not taking pictures\" - his mother had a box brownie and did her own developing in the cellar. When he left school on his 15th birthday without any qualifications he took a series of odd jobs, including debt collector for a boxing referee, carpet salesman, copy boy for the Yorkshire Post Fleet Street office and window dresser. He was called up for National Service at 18 and responded by staying up for two nights before his medical and eating nothing but nutmeg: \"Someone said it made your heart go faster. But I was still A1.\" He chose the air force because he thought it would be easier than the army and was posted to Singapore and Malaya where he trained in parachuting and jungle rescue. </p> <p>\"I read a lot in the air force,\" he says. \"Although I don't really read, I just sort of skim the pages. I see the words more than read them. I was making up for lost time and I got through four or five books a week. I knew somewhere in the back of my mind that reading was the key to power in some way.\" He speaks now with the wide-ranging enthusiasms of the auto-didact. He drops in something he saw in the Koran, mentions what \"Mr Einstein\" said about such and such and praises the novelist Peter Ackroyd's treatment of London. </p> <p>Brian Clarke remembers being with Bailey in the Groucho club not long after it opened. \"We were having a drink and this young publisher came up to us. Bailey asked what he was publishing and he said, 'we're doing the annotated letters of Marcel Proust. Have you heard of him?' Bailey said, 'yes. We visual people read more than you literary people look.\" </p> <p>Bailey says his life was changed in the air force: \"I saw a Cartier Bresson photograph that completely knocked me sideways, and some paintings by Picasso of Dora Maar. When Picasso came along it was almost like getting religion. I realised there were no rules. A bicycle wheel could be square because Picasso said so.\" Some years later he was asked to photograph Picasso but said no, not wanting to risk spoiling the myth - \"although I do regret that now\". </p> <p>So how did he get on in the forces with Picasso's study of Dora Maar above his bed? \"Everyone else had pin-ups of girls over their beds, so I did used to get into fights. But because I was from the East End I could look after myself. I also had the best-looking WAAF as my girlfriend so they knew I wasn't gay.\" </p> <p>He bought his first serious camera in Singapore where they were cheap and took it to Chinese pawn shops every other week to pay for film and to get it developed; he still has the tickets. After leaving the air force in 1958 he applied to all the top London studios for a job. The photographer John French made him third assistant and gave him an introduction to John Parsons, the Vogue art director. Bailey says: \"They were both gay, and looking back I realised that I was an outsider like they were. They were beyond the class and the accent thing.\" </p> <p>Within a few months he was working as a freelance, taking fashion pictures for the Daily Express, and soon after was offered a contract at Vogue. He turned it down at first because as a freelance he was getting paid more for one picture than they were offering per week. \"But I didn't really know what Vogue was,\" he says. \"I thought it was just another magazine that used pictures. I wasn't that interested in fashion and preferred reportage and portraits, but fashion gradually took over because of Vogue.\" </p> <p>In 1961, a year after he began work for British Vogue, he was given a contract by American Vogue. When he and Shrimpton arrived at their first meeting with editor Diana Vreeland in New York, her response anticipated the reaction the Beatles would get a few years later. \"Stop!\" she exclaimed to all her staff, \"the British have arrived!\" Robin Derrick, the present art director at British Vogue, carries on the comparison. \"Bailey invented the persona of a British fashion photographer. And the body of work is colossal.\" Derrick also cites the importance of Bailey's ability to charm people. \"When he speaks to you he grips your forearm. Even if he then talks to someone else he doesn't let go of you. It's not technique. It's the way he is. He took my picture once. It's not the best picture he's ever done, and it's not even the best picture of me ever done, but I did feel what it was like to have the charm gun pointed right at you for a moment. He is a very engaging man.\" </p> <p>The photography writer Terry Hope edited Bailey's column in Amateur Photographer magazine. He says for the general photographic public Bailey was also enormously influential: \"He had no problem that it was a magazine with the 'amateur' in the title and was aimed largely at enthusiasts. He sees himself as a working photographer and people respect that. There have been a lot of good photographers since, but there's not really been anyone who captured people's imagination in the way he did.\" </p> <p>When speaking about the 60s, Bailey runs through his patter with practised ease: The Beatles were a bit of a joke and it was the Stones who were really interesting; him and Terry Stamp and Donovan and Jean Shrimpton and Mick and Vidal Sassoon were all mates so fame wasn't that weird; all they were aware of was, in perhaps what will be his best-remembered phrase that, \"the 50s were grey and the 60s were black and white\". </p> <p>Martin Harrison, who has curated a major touring exhibition of Bailey's work, Birth of the Cool, which opens in Edinburgh next week, says that while the word iconic is overused, nothing else fits Bailey's work of the period. \"His pictures of the Krays and Mick Jagger and all that are what people now call iconic images of the modern age. it might be a bit of a drag for him, but you can't stop his pictures being that.\" The exhibition includes all the key images from the 60s as well as more recent work. \"Seeing a picture of Jean Shrimpton next to Kate Moss, there is a sort of stylistic continuity. His work is usually very graphic, very close up, quite contrasty and even stark.\" </p> <p>Although Bailey says that as a photographer he was always more an observer than a participant, his life and relationships were headline news. He says he has had four marriages and six wives. The first was Rosemary Bramble, a Clapham typist he married in 1960, who has been slightly airbrushed out of the legend. The following year he embarked on a four-year relationship with Jean Shrimpton. He met Deneuve when shooting her for Playboy in Paris. Their wedding precipitated a tabloid scandal when she wore a black dress and smoked throughout the ceremony and he wore jeans. </p> <p>Although still technically married to Deneuve, in 1968 he began to live with American model Penelope Tree. She was 17 and he was 30 when their relationship began. He still counts her among his four or five closest friends. \"I fell in love with him,\" she says. \"It was pretty instant. I'd never met anyone quite so honest or sexually direct.\" Tree, from a wealthy Anglo-American family, said that being photographed by him was, \"like being circled by a bird of prey. You are the only thing in his mind and vision, and that can be quite exciting.\" </p> <p>When they started to live together she began to work for the drug charity Release. Despite his apparently raffish lifestyle, in domestic matters Bailey was conservative, particularly in what he expected from his partners. He complained that her new friends would come to his house, drink his scotch, smoke his dope and then accuse him of being a capitalist. \"He was very suspicious of the people I brought home and that I had another life,\" says Tree. \"But he is also very perceptive. There were some wankers around, but also he was closed to anyone who wasn't on his track. Much more than most people he is on his own track and he's not really interested in anything outside of that. He is still totally single-minded. he has a really clear idea of what he wants in life. He is incredibly ambitious in that he really believes he can leave a mark on the world.\" </p> <p>He married the model Marie Helvin in 1975. They divorced 10 years later and he married his current wife, the second Catherine Bai ley, who as Catherine Dyer was a model. The couple have three school-age children, Fenton, Paloma and Sascha. Bailey says fatherhood has made him more tolerant of people: \"My assistants have benefited.\" Catherine and the children are based in Devon but Bailey rarely goes there, instead spending most of his time in London in his ultra-modern glass flat in King's Cross or at his nearby studio. </p> <p>As with all his partners, Bailey has extensively photographed Catherine. There are fashion shots and family shots and arty shots and pornographic, or erotic, shots. It is an area of his work that has caused consistent controversy. In response to his 1984 book, Nudes, Germaine Greer wrote, \"the surface of the plate excites him more than skin could ever do. The sensibility that emerges from [the book] is neither gross, nor sensualist nor perverse, but jaded, aloof, calculating and inhuman.\" </p> <p>Catherine herself has said how proud she is of his work and has spoken of how pictures of her in lesbian clinches and other explicit scenes in fact celebrate female sexuality. But, and it feels very suburban even to ask the question, how does Bailey feel about his children seeing their mother portrayed in this way? \"They grew up with it so it is nothing new. Maybe if they suddenly saw it for the first time it would be different, and maybe their friends snigger a bit.\" He says that the 1995 book of pictures of Catherine, The Lady Is A Tramp, \"is probably the best book I have ever done. It is the most personal.\" </p> <p>And have his photographs of women changed since his wife became a mother? \"Like the old Mafia joke? He'd only allow his mistress to give him a blow job because his wife kisses his children? No, it hasn't changed anything for me.\" What troubles him more is that, \"photography is always about the dead. You look at a Picasso and you don't think that the people in it are dead. But if you look at an old photograph of a couple you think about the fact that they are both dead. A painting removes death, but in photography you retain death.\" </p> <p>He says he has always thought about death. \"I think I was so surrounded by it being bought up during the war. All I remember is being whacked round the head and told to stand still while another hearse went by. It is not really death, it is the idea that I am going to miss something and not be around to see what is going on. I'm sort of living my life backwards, having children so late, [he was 47 when his first child was born] and it is sad in a way because you think about dying and not seeing them grow up. It is the curiosity of living that is exciting. It is not as simple as just the reaper. If it was I would have my lawyers talk to the reaper now and sort something out.\" His 1992 book of his 80s work, If We Shadows, is re-issued later this month. The opening image is of a tombstone he saw in Australia bearing the legend \"In loving memory of David Bailey. Died February 10th 1926 aged 39\". </p> <p>In fact Bailey's health is pretty good. \"A lot of photographers have burned up and combusted in hazes of drugs and booze,\" says Robin Derrick, \"but he hasn't.\" Bailey has the occasional cigar but says he hasn't drunk for 25 years. \"Drink was never a real problem, and just before I stopped I never really got drunk. There is a misconception that it was all drugs in the 60s but it was mostly drink. A bottle of wine was always open. My mother died at 86 and my gran at 96, but the men didn't do too well, but then they were drinkers and smokers.\" He consoles himself by noting that, \"most photographers seem to live until they are 90\". But that was not true in the case of his friend Terence Donovan who committed suicide in 1996. Bailey said soon afterwards that his death was \"the worst thing that ever happened to me\". </p> <p>He started making commercials in the mid 60s and has now directed nearly 500. He directed the first Flake advert - the first ad to be banned by British television - and in a recent television poll of the top 100 ads he had the unique distinction of featuring both in front of the camera - \"who do you think you are? David Bailey?\" - and behind, with, some would say ironically, the \"feminist\" Volkswagen ad in which the woman discards her fur coat and jewellery. He also directed the Lynx anti-fur ad - \"It takes a dozen dumb animals to make a fur coat and just one to wear it\". </p> <p>\"It is difficult to put as much artistically into commercials,\" he admits, \"but I try. The ones where I have done what I wanted, like the Volkswagen one, do work pretty well.\" As a documentary film-maker he has made films on Warhol, and his 1998 film, Models Close Up, was the highest-rated Channel 4 documentary that year. \"Someone said it was a deep look into shallow waters,\" he laughs, \"which I liked.\" It is a fine piece of work in which he not only showcased his natural empathy with the models but did his duty to the viewer by raising the exploitative and predatory aspects of the industry. He also questioned Naomi Campbell about tantrums and Kate Moss about drugs. </p> <p>Throughout his career he also found time for photo-documentary projects. There was a moody study of London's East End in the late 60s, a catalogue of the area around his former Primrose Hill home, a trip to Papua New Guinea in the mid-70s and a decade later he went to Sudan during the famine for Band Aid. The Nobel prize-winning novelist William Golding wrote the preface for the resulting book, Imagine. Some of these pictures, \"will keep you awake tonight,\" warned Golding, \"and perhaps make you feel you will stay awake for ever\". </p> <p>But it is his classic portraits for which he is still best known. One of 25 Beatles pictures recently went for \u00a310,000 and one of the remaining 10 Kray brother pictures sold for \u00a315,000. He says he thinks he has become a photographer's photographer. \"I do things that unless you are a photographer you wouldn't even notice. For the last 20 years I have refused to put hands in my portraits. But you would only really notice that if you knew about photography. So sometimes the pictures become a message to another photographer. Only [someone like] Bruce Weber is going to understand what you are talking about. I know that is ultra-indulgent, but sometimes I do my pictures for them.\" </p> <p>Bailey says because of this he is more popular with older photographers than with younger ones. Rankin, from Dazed and Confused magazine, is one of the most acclaimed young British photographers. He agrees that Bailey is sometimes dismissed. \"But it's too easy to say he's past it. Bailey and Richard Avedon were the two who influenced me most in portrait photography. I thought the sensitivity and the emotion he could capture from his subjects were inspiring. And his style still stands up. He does shots of Johnny Depp like he would have done 40 years ago, and they are great.\" </p> <p>David Puttnam says the presence of young talent acts as a spur to Bailey. \"He is a genuine workaholic and wouldn't know what to do with himself if he stopped. But he's also very ambitious and genuinely believes he's got a lot left in him. Even with him and Donovan and Duffy, as close as they were, they were incredibly competitive with each other.\" </p> <p>Bailey continues with his schedule and lets whatever public image he has look after itself. Well, almost. Antonioni's film version may be 35 years old, but it's never too late to get the details right. \"The whole thing about the East End fashion photographer is that it is perfect for cheap journalism,\" he explains. \"They always have me talking like a cockney but I don't think I speak particularly cockney. And in fact I've never been out with girls who wear white boots. And I've never called a woman a bird.\" </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance: </strong> David Royston Bailey </p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> London, January 2 1938. </p> <p><strong> Educated: </strong> Plashet Grove School, East Ham, London. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> Rosemary Bramble 1960, divorced; Catherine Deneuve1967, divorced;Marie Helvin 1975, divorced; Catherine Dyer 1985 (two sons Fenton16 and Sascha 6, one daughter Paloma 15). </p> <p><strong> Major exhibitions:</strong> National Portrait Gallery 1971; V &amp; A 1983; international centre of photography, New York 1984; Barbican 1999. </p> <p><strong> Books:</strong> Box Of Pinups 1964, Goodbye Baby And Amen 1969; Beady Minces 1974; Papua New Guinea 1975; Trouble And Strife 1980; Lon don NW1 1982; Black And White Memories 1983; Nudes 1984; Imagine 1985; If We Shadows 1992; Lady Is A Tramp 1995; Rock &amp; Roll Heroes 1997; Archive One 1999. </p> <p><strong> Films: </strong> Warhol 1974; Who Dealt? 1993; Lady is a Tramp 1995; Models Close-Up 1998; The Intruder 1999. </p> <p>\u0095 Birth of the Cool opens February 17 at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh.

      "bodyText": "The leading character in Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 film Blow-Up, a womanising, Bentley-driving, ineffably cool photographer, was played by David Hemmings. But even before the film was released everyone \"knew\" it was based on David Bailey. It never really mattered that the photographs used in the film - an intriguing if highly flawed siting of Italian Marxist cinematic theory in swinging London - were in fact taken by Don McCullin. Or that the Hemmings character was also drawn from the two other members of the East-End photographic triumvirate; Brian Duffy and Terence Donovan. Although it was Hemmings's body that sat astride the model and pushed the camera lens into her face, as far as history is concerned it was David Bailey who launched into what has become the clich\u00e9d patter of the fashion studio: \"That's great, that's great,\" he coaxed the supine girl. \"Again with the hair. Do that again. C'mon, c'mon. More, much more.\" That this image has proved so durable - Mike Myers recently acknowledged its part in the creation of Austin Powers - must be particularly irksome to Bailey, who claims that by the time the film was released the 60s were over; \"after 66 it was just media hype\". But equally, by that time, he had already taken some of the defining photos of the decade - the unlined face of the young Mick Jagger, the Kray twins playing with their pet snakes, the first supermodel, Jean Shrimpton, emerging from the crowd on a Manhattan street - and had become a household name. All the while his life was being lived as much before the lens as behind it. The tall, skinny, beautiful and posh women he photographed and slept with, among them Shrimpton, provided the template for contemporary cool. By the time he married the French actress Catherine Deneuve in 1967, with Mick Jagger as his best man, he was front-page news. For better or worse it was this incarnation that Antonioni sealed forever on celluloid. The artist Brian Clarke has known Bailey for 25 years. \"The fact that his personal history has become confused with the body of work is not helpful to the understanding of that work. But, I have no hesitation in saying he is one of the great defining photographers of our time.\" Clarke says what sets him apart, astonishingly for someone who has made a career in the fashion industry, is authenticity. \"He has no bullshit and for someone in that world it is almost unique. Of all the famous people I have known, Bailey carries fame with the least sense of burden. He knows it is meaningless and he deals with it on that level. He is neither impressed by fame nor hindered by it.\" David Puttnam was Bailey's agent in the mid-60s. Puttnam says: \"To his immense credit he hasn't changed at all. He still has all the same strengths and all the same weaknesses he ever had. He genuinely loves photography. He still gets excited by the equipment and the process and the technology as well as the images.\" Photo historian Martin Harrison worked with Bailey on his huge 1999 retrospective book Archive One and has curated several major exhibitions of his work. \"He hates his association with the 60s because he is still working now. Most artists don't want to talk about their old stuff because they are producing new stuff all the time. He is associated with this glamorous 60s thing. But it's not like he took a dive in 69.\" Indeed Bailey has been working solidly ever since and has amassed a vast body of work. \"But I don't really look at my old stuff and don't really think about it that much,\" he says. \"I made a movie in 1999 [The Intruder] and I've never really seen the finished version on a screen.\" Instead he throws himself into a dizzying schedule of new projects. Recently a day trip to Helsinki was immediately followed by four days in South Africa. In the previous nine months he had been to New York eight times, LA twice, Japan, India, the Philippines, as well as \"many\" trips to Spain and France. He also does portrait photography for a prince in Saudi Arabia - \"but I always charge more or less the same no matter who they are; once you try and get too clever you get your knickers in a twist\" - and says the travel is not too bad because a lot of it is on private planes. But most of his work is done in London anyway, although 85% is for overseas consumption. This has been the routine for 40 years, and the result is not only some of the finest fashion and portrait photography of the period, but also nearly 500 commercials - the current one for Orange mobile phones showing hands imprinted with orange squares is his - books, documentaries, exhibitions and films. As far back as 1966 he directed a film, GG Passion, about a rock star being hounded to death by his fans - it was partly funded by Roman Polanski, who also introduced him to Catherine Deneuve - and as recently as 1999 he directed a low budget, noirish thriller, The Intruder, staring Nastassja Kinski and Charlotte Gainsbourg Brian Clarke says there is no mystery as to why, now aged 63, Bailey keeps going so hard: \"He's an artist. Artists always keep going.\" Indeed, despite working throughout his career in a profoundly commercial arena, he has been respected as an artist almost from the beginning. There was a full-scale exhibition of his work in the National Portrait Gallery as far back as 1971, and the V&amp;A has also held a major show. The NPG first bought his work in 1972 - a portrait of Julie Christie - and in 1988 commissioned him to photograph Princess Diana. Bailey acknowledges the irony in this: as a child, \"photography was something you did once a year on Margate Beach\". He was born in Leytonstone 1938 in the next street to where one of his heroes, Alfred Hitchcock, was born. He's always said that his main influence was the cinema and not other photographers. \"The only cultural thing I had in the East End was the cinema. We went there because it was cheaper than putting a shilling in the gas. We'd go seven nights a week sometimes. I was already taking pictures before I even saw work by Irvine Penn or Bill Brandt.\" The family moved to East Ham when he was three, after their house was damaged by a Luft waffe bomb. He has one younger sister, Thelma, and says he was brought up by his mother and his aunt Dolly, \"everyone had an Aunt Dolly in the East End.\" He hardly ever saw his father, a tailor's cutter, describing him as a bit of a Jack the Lad. \"My mother and father sort of split up and my father wasn't interested in what I did. I never liked him but I was probably conditioned by my mother not to like him. I was hers and my sister was more his. I don't think he liked me but I never really saw him that much.\" Despite his association with the East End, as a child he was not stereotypical. He disliked football, liked bird-watching and at 10 stopped eating meat. \"My father thought I was fucking queer, but queer didn't mean homosexual. In those days it just meant a bit of an oddball.\" He was also different in that he was an undiagnosed dyslexic. \"I knew I was smarter than the teachers,\" he recalls, \"but they thought I was an idiot and I used to get the cane for not being able to spell and all that kind of thing.\" He now says that while the idea of him being a visual rather than a literary person cannot all be ascribed to his dyslexia, he acknowledges that it definitely pushed him in that direction. The only subject he was any good at was drawing. He still paints and produces about six pieces a year, mostly for his own pleasure although he has sold \"a few\" including two works to New York artist Julian Schnabel. When he was 14 or 15 he started to go to dance halls and learned about the local gang culture. \"The Krays, the Barking Boys and the Canning Town Boys were the three gangs at the time. They weren't gangsters, they were just hooligans. They just went around beating people up if you looked at them wrong in a dance hall. I got beat up by the Barking Boys because I danced with one of their girlfriends. They left me in the doorway of Times Furnishing.\" A dozen years later his photos of the Krays were a key element in building both his and their reputations. It added to his cachet as a product of that world and provided them with some of the recognition they craved. The writer Francis Wyndham, who was working for Queen magazine and the Sunday Times, made the introduction and arranged for the photographs to be taken. \"I had a very na\u00efve idea for doing something about gangsters so I wrote round to them all and only the Krays replied,\" Wyndham recalls. \"They'd just successfully sued the Mirror for libel and had just got off some charges so they felt on top of the world. I've often wished I'd had a tiny percentage of those photographs. Bailey was their ideal person. They really respected him because he was from the same place as them but had won his success and fame legally.\" Bailey's first exposure to photography was, \"mucking around with the chemicals, not taking pictures\" - his mother had a box brownie and did her own developing in the cellar. When he left school on his 15th birthday without any qualifications he took a series of odd jobs, including debt collector for a boxing referee, carpet salesman, copy boy for the Yorkshire Post Fleet Street office and window dresser. He was called up for National Service at 18 and responded by staying up for two nights before his medical and eating nothing but nutmeg: \"Someone said it made your heart go faster. But I was still A1.\" He chose the air force because he thought it would be easier than the army and was posted to Singapore and Malaya where he trained in parachuting and jungle rescue. \"I read a lot in the air force,\" he says. \"Although I don't really read, I just sort of skim the pages. I see the words more than read them. I was making up for lost time and I got through four or five books a week. I knew somewhere in the back of my mind that reading was the key to power in some way.\" He speaks now with the wide-ranging enthusiasms of the auto-didact. He drops in something he saw in the Koran, mentions what \"Mr Einstein\" said about such and such and praises the novelist Peter Ackroyd's treatment of London. Brian Clarke remembers being with Bailey in the Groucho club not long after it opened. \"We were having a drink and this young publisher came up to us. Bailey asked what he was publishing and he said, 'we're doing the annotated letters of Marcel Proust. Have you heard of him?' Bailey said, 'yes. We visual people read more than you literary people look.\" Bailey says his life was changed in the air force: \"I saw a Cartier Bresson photograph that completely knocked me sideways, and some paintings by Picasso of Dora Maar. When Picasso came along it was almost like getting religion. I realised there were no rules. A bicycle wheel could be square because Picasso said so.\" Some years later he was asked to photograph Picasso but said no, not wanting to risk spoiling the myth - \"although I do regret that now\". So how did he get on in the forces with Picasso's study of Dora Maar above his bed? \"Everyone else had pin-ups of girls over their beds, so I did used to get into fights. But because I was from the East End I could look after myself. I also had the best-looking WAAF as my girlfriend so they knew I wasn't gay.\" He bought his first serious camera in Singapore where they were cheap and took it to Chinese pawn shops every other week to pay for film and to get it developed; he still has the tickets. After leaving the air force in 1958 he applied to all the top London studios for a job. The photographer John French made him third assistant and gave him an introduction to John Parsons, the Vogue art director. Bailey says: \"They were both gay, and looking back I realised that I was an outsider like they were. They were beyond the class and the accent thing.\" Within a few months he was working as a freelance, taking fashion pictures for the Daily Express, and soon after was offered a contract at Vogue. He turned it down at first because as a freelance he was getting paid more for one picture than they were offering per week. \"But I didn't really know what Vogue was,\" he says. \"I thought it was just another magazine that used pictures. I wasn't that interested in fashion and preferred reportage and portraits, but fashion gradually took over because of Vogue.\" In 1961, a year after he began work for British Vogue, he was given a contract by American Vogue. When he and Shrimpton arrived at their first meeting with editor Diana Vreeland in New York, her response anticipated the reaction the Beatles would get a few years later. \"Stop!\" she exclaimed to all her staff, \"the British have arrived!\" Robin Derrick, the present art director at British Vogue, carries on the comparison. \"Bailey invented the persona of a British fashion photographer. And the body of work is colossal.\" Derrick also cites the importance of Bailey's ability to charm people. \"When he speaks to you he grips your forearm. Even if he then talks to someone else he doesn't let go of you. It's not technique. It's the way he is. He took my picture once. It's not the best picture he's ever done, and it's not even the best picture of me ever done, but I did feel what it was like to have the charm gun pointed right at you for a moment. He is a very engaging man.\" The photography writer Terry Hope edited Bailey's column in Amateur Photographer magazine. He says for the general photographic public Bailey was also enormously influential: \"He had no problem that it was a magazine with the 'amateur' in the title and was aimed largely at enthusiasts. He sees himself as a working photographer and people respect that. There have been a lot of good photographers since, but there's not really been anyone who captured people's imagination in the way he did.\" When speaking about the 60s, Bailey runs through his patter with practised ease: The Beatles were a bit of a joke and it was the Stones who were really interesting; him and Terry Stamp and Donovan and Jean Shrimpton and Mick and Vidal Sassoon were all mates so fame wasn't that weird; all they were aware of was, in perhaps what will be his best-remembered phrase that, \"the 50s were grey and the 60s were black and white\". Martin Harrison, who has curated a major touring exhibition of Bailey's work, Birth of the Cool, which opens in Edinburgh next week, says that while the word iconic is overused, nothing else fits Bailey's work of the period. \"His pictures of the Krays and Mick Jagger and all that are what people now call iconic images of the modern age. it might be a bit of a drag for him, but you can't stop his pictures being that.\" The exhibition includes all the key images from the 60s as well as more recent work. \"Seeing a picture of Jean Shrimpton next to Kate Moss, there is a sort of stylistic continuity. His work is usually very graphic, very close up, quite contrasty and even stark.\" Although Bailey says that as a photographer he was always more an observer than a participant, his life and relationships were headline news. He says he has had four marriages and six wives. The first was Rosemary Bramble, a Clapham typist he married in 1960, who has been slightly airbrushed out of the legend. The following year he embarked on a four-year relationship with Jean Shrimpton. He met Deneuve when shooting her for Playboy in Paris. Their wedding precipitated a tabloid scandal when she wore a black dress and smoked throughout the ceremony and he wore jeans. Although still technically married to Deneuve, in 1968 he began to live with American model Penelope Tree. She was 17 and he was 30 when their relationship began. He still counts her among his four or five closest friends. \"I fell in love with him,\" she says. \"It was pretty instant. I'd never met anyone quite so honest or sexually direct.\" Tree, from a wealthy Anglo-American family, said that being photographed by him was, \"like being circled by a bird of prey. You are the only thing in his mind and vision, and that can be quite exciting.\" When they started to live together she began to work for the drug charity Release. Despite his apparently raffish lifestyle, in domestic matters Bailey was conservative, particularly in what he expected from his partners. He complained that her new friends would come to his house, drink his scotch, smoke his dope and then accuse him of being a capitalist. \"He was very suspicious of the people I brought home and that I had another life,\" says Tree. \"But he is also very perceptive. There were some wankers around, but also he was closed to anyone who wasn't on his track. Much more than most people he is on his own track and he's not really interested in anything outside of that. He is still totally single-minded. he has a really clear idea of what he wants in life. He is incredibly ambitious in that he really believes he can leave a mark on the world.\" He married the model Marie Helvin in 1975. They divorced 10 years later and he married his current wife, the second Catherine Bai ley, who as Catherine Dyer was a model. The couple have three school-age children, Fenton, Paloma and Sascha. Bailey says fatherhood has made him more tolerant of people: \"My assistants have benefited.\" Catherine and the children are based in Devon but Bailey rarely goes there, instead spending most of his time in London in his ultra-modern glass flat in King's Cross or at his nearby studio. As with all his partners, Bailey has extensively photographed Catherine. There are fashion shots and family shots and arty shots and pornographic, or erotic, shots. It is an area of his work that has caused consistent controversy. In response to his 1984 book, Nudes, Germaine Greer wrote, \"the surface of the plate excites him more than skin could ever do. The sensibility that emerges from [the book] is neither gross, nor sensualist nor perverse, but jaded, aloof, calculating and inhuman.\" Catherine herself has said how proud she is of his work and has spoken of how pictures of her in lesbian clinches and other explicit scenes in fact celebrate female sexuality. But, and it feels very suburban even to ask the question, how does Bailey feel about his children seeing their mother portrayed in this way? \"They grew up with it so it is nothing new. Maybe if they suddenly saw it for the first time it would be different, and maybe their friends snigger a bit.\" He says that the 1995 book of pictures of Catherine, The Lady Is A Tramp, \"is probably the best book I have ever done. It is the most personal.\" And have his photographs of women changed since his wife became a mother? \"Like the old Mafia joke? He'd only allow his mistress to give him a blow job because his wife kisses his children? No, it hasn't changed anything for me.\" What troubles him more is that, \"photography is always about the dead. You look at a Picasso and you don't think that the people in it are dead. But if you look at an old photograph of a couple you think about the fact that they are both dead. A painting removes death, but in photography you retain death.\" He says he has always thought about death. \"I think I was so surrounded by it being bought up during the war. All I remember is being whacked round the head and told to stand still while another hearse went by. It is not really death, it is the idea that I am going to miss something and not be around to see what is going on. I'm sort of living my life backwards, having children so late, [he was 47 when his first child was born] and it is sad in a way because you think about dying and not seeing them grow up. It is the curiosity of living that is exciting. It is not as simple as just the reaper. If it was I would have my lawyers talk to the reaper now and sort something out.\" His 1992 book of his 80s work, If We Shadows, is re-issued later this month. The opening image is of a tombstone he saw in Australia bearing the legend \"In loving memory of David Bailey. Died February 10th 1926 aged 39\". In fact Bailey's health is pretty good. \"A lot of photographers have burned up and combusted in hazes of drugs and booze,\" says Robin Derrick, \"but he hasn't.\" Bailey has the occasional cigar but says he hasn't drunk for 25 years. \"Drink was never a real problem, and just before I stopped I never really got drunk. There is a misconception that it was all drugs in the 60s but it was mostly drink. A bottle of wine was always open. My mother died at 86 and my gran at 96, but the men didn't do too well, but then they were drinkers and smokers.\" He consoles himself by noting that, \"most photographers seem to live until they are 90\". But that was not true in the case of his friend Terence Donovan who committed suicide in 1996. Bailey said soon afterwards that his death was \"the worst thing that ever happened to me\". He started making commercials in the mid 60s and has now directed nearly 500. He directed the first Flake advert - the first ad to be banned by British television - and in a recent television poll of the top 100 ads he had the unique distinction of featuring both in front of the camera - \"who do you think you are? David Bailey?\" - and behind, with, some would say ironically, the \"feminist\" Volkswagen ad in which the woman discards her fur coat and jewellery. He also directed the Lynx anti-fur ad - \"It takes a dozen dumb animals to make a fur coat and just one to wear it\". \"It is difficult to put as much artistically into commercials,\" he admits, \"but I try. The ones where I have done what I wanted, like the Volkswagen one, do work pretty well.\" As a documentary film-maker he has made films on Warhol, and his 1998 film, Models Close Up, was the highest-rated Channel 4 documentary that year. \"Someone said it was a deep look into shallow waters,\" he laughs, \"which I liked.\" It is a fine piece of work in which he not only showcased his natural empathy with the models but did his duty to the viewer by raising the exploitative and predatory aspects of the industry. He also questioned Naomi Campbell about tantrums and Kate Moss about drugs. Throughout his career he also found time for photo-documentary projects. There was a moody study of London's East End in the late 60s, a catalogue of the area around his former Primrose Hill home, a trip to Papua New Guinea in the mid-70s and a decade later he went to Sudan during the famine for Band Aid. The Nobel prize-winning novelist William Golding wrote the preface for the resulting book, Imagine. Some of these pictures, \"will keep you awake tonight,\" warned Golding, \"and perhaps make you feel you will stay awake for ever\". But it is his classic portraits for which he is still best known. One of 25 Beatles pictures recently went for \u00a310,000 and one of the remaining 10 Kray brother pictures sold for \u00a315,000. He says he thinks he has become a photographer's photographer. \"I do things that unless you are a photographer you wouldn't even notice. For the last 20 years I have refused to put hands in my portraits. But you would only really notice that if you knew about photography. So sometimes the pictures become a message to another photographer. Only [someone like] Bruce Weber is going to understand what you are talking about. I know that is ultra-indulgent, but sometimes I do my pictures for them.\" Bailey says because of this he is more popular with older photographers than with younger ones. Rankin, from Dazed and Confused magazine, is one of the most acclaimed young British photographers. He agrees that Bailey is sometimes dismissed. \"But it's too easy to say he's past it. Bailey and Richard Avedon were the two who influenced me most in portrait photography. I thought the sensitivity and the emotion he could capture from his subjects were inspiring. And his style still stands up. He does shots of Johnny Depp like he would have done 40 years ago, and they are great.\" David Puttnam says the presence of young talent acts as a spur to Bailey. \"He is a genuine workaholic and wouldn't know what to do with himself if he stopped. But he's also very ambitious and genuinely believes he's got a lot left in him. Even with him and Donovan and Duffy, as close as they were, they were incredibly competitive with each other.\" Bailey continues with his schedule and lets whatever public image he has look after itself. Well, almost. Antonioni's film version may be 35 years old, but it's never too late to get the details right. \"The whole thing about the East End fashion photographer is that it is perfect for cheap journalism,\" he explains. \"They always have me talking like a cockney but I don't think I speak particularly cockney. And in fact I've never been out with girls who wear white boots. And I've never called a woman a bird.\" Life at a glance: David Royston Bailey Born: London, January 2 1938.

      "body": "<p>It had a cast of 36,000, cost a whopping 5m Reichsmarks and set the standard for science fiction films for decades to come. Fritz Lang's silent classic Metropolis - which had already bankrupted the huge Ufa studio before its premiere in Berlin on January 10 1927 - was a dystopian vision of the 21st century: an enslaved underclass, forced to maintain the scientific luxury of the ruling elite, revolt and bring the city to its knees, until a pauper girl and an aristocratic boy's love for each other saves the day. </p> <p>Fittingly, 21st-century Berlin will tomorrow host the world premiere of the digital reconstruction of Lang's masterpiece - part of the Berlin film festival's 55-film retrospective of the great director's work.

      "bodyText": "It had a cast of 36,000, cost a whopping 5m Reichsmarks and set the standard for science fiction films for decades to come. Fritz Lang's silent classic Metropolis - which had already bankrupted the huge Ufa studio before its premiere in Berlin on January 10 1927 - was a dystopian vision of the 21st century: an enslaved underclass, forced to maintain the scientific luxury of the ruling elite, revolt and bring the city to its knees, until a pauper girl and an aristocratic boy's love for each other saves the day. Fittingly, 21st-century Berlin will tomorrow host the world premiere of the digital reconstruction of Lang's masterpiece - part of the Berlin film festival's 55-film retrospective of the great director's work.

      "body": "<p>The job of the critic, said the 19th-century aesthetician Walter Pater, is to elucidate \"the peculiar quality of pleasure\" that an artist gives us. He was thinking about Sandro Botticelli, the 15th-century Florentine painter of The Birth of Venus and The Primavera, whose crisply sensual art was practically forgotten in 1870, when Pater published his essay. Pater, bringing to Botticelli the hedonistic eye of a man who taught Oscar Wilde a thing or two, resurrected him as an artist and launched him as what he is now - one of the sexiest names of the Renaissance. </p> <p>Botticelli's Mars and Venus lie languidly in the National Gallery, in a painting on poplar wood probably stripped from a bedroom chest. Mars is a young man asleep, almost naked, his limbs painted with incredible precision - the skin under his knee is delicately creased - while Venus, more powerful in her white robe, rules the picture. Love triumphs over war and, just to emphasise the point, naughty, plump little cupids play with Mars's discarded armour. It is exquisite. </p> <p>Botticelli gives us a special kind of pleasure, just as Pater claimed. But Pater didn't know the half of it. He had never seen the drawings by Botticelli that come to the Royal Academy in London next month. He had an idea they existed - he saw bad copies of some of them - and knew they must be important. But it is only now, after centuries of obscurity, that Botticelli's illustrations to Dante's Divine Comedy have been brought together from disparate collections in Rome and Berlin. They are Botticelli's greatest work, as well as the most ravishing of the many illustrations to The Divine Comedy done over the past 700 years. Seeing these drawings, probably done for Botticelli's patron Lorenzo de Pierfrancesco de' Medici, is like finding that a house you have known all your life has a secret, beautiful room. </p> <p>The Victorians rediscovered Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) about the same time as Botticelli. They adored the story of his unrequited love for Beatrice Portinari, which he wrote about in La Vita Nuova. Victorian painters, including Dante Gabriel Rossetti, loved to imagine the world of desire of Dante's Florence; in Rossetti's Dante's Dream (1871), with a view of the Palazzo Vecchio in the background, Dante sees Beatrice - posed by Rossetti's lover Jane Morris - in her tomb. It is a morbidly sensual vision of sex and death. </p> <p>The Divine Comedy tells of Dante's journey through the afterlife to discover the meaning of Christian faith. His quest is described in three books - Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. As he is led through Inferno (Hell) by the Roman poet Virgil, Dante meets friends who fought with him in the communal strife that tore medieval Florence apart: the struggle of two factions, the Guelphs - to which Dante belonged - and the Ghibellines. Dante's faction was hounded out of the city, and he wrote The Divine Comedy from exile in Ravenna. The poem is full of the ghosts of a broken community. </p> <p>Nineteenth-century artists took a dangerous pleasure in Dante's tale. They took their cue from William Blake, whose Romantic illustrations take the side of the sinners against a tyrant god; his drawing of the condemned blasphemer Capaneus makes him a muscular, proud rebel against God. It is this pleasure in hell that gives Victorian illustrations of Inferno their peculiar power. Gustave Dor\u00e9's engraved illustrations, published in 1868, were a central influence on French symbolism and Max Ernst's surrealist collages; Dor\u00e9's vision of hell is macabre, full of black pits and bodies sensually torn apart. Dor\u00e9 models his statuesque sinners - nude like Botticelli's - on Renaissance art, in particular on Michelangelo. His Dante is a pastiche of Renaissance art as an art of sadistic pleasure. </p> <p>This fascination culminated in The Gates of Hell, a vast bronze relief of sinners plummeting downwards, bodies writhing, tangled, in arabesques, on which Auguste Rodin worked from 1880 to his death in 1917. The Gates of Hell are taken from Dante; as Virgil leads Dante through them he reads the inscription, Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here. Rodin's gates are not theological: they explode into hellish delight in the possibilities of form. </p> <p>Yet all these later versions of Dante, even Robert Rauschenberg's illustrated Inferno with its transposition of the fires of Hell to 1960s America, pale beside Botticelli's interpretation. </p> <p>Dante is unambiguous about how easy it is to end up in hell and how much praying you have to do to get from purgatory to paradise. But there's also pleasure, a voluptuous enjoyment of all the things of this world. In the way it revels in landscape, literature and the individual, with every character realised in the most vivid way, The Divine Comedy belongs to the Renaissance - to Botticelli and his peers. </p> <p>Consider Dante's relish for the natural world. Landscape was in medieval culture a barren wilderness, full of sinful birds and bees. Dante loves it. His entire epic poem is, in a sense, about landscape. He lavishes attention on the physical topography of the other world: the descending circles of hell, the mountain of purgatory, the spheres of heaven. It is one of the few poems you need maps to make sense of. This discovery of the physical world is what we associate with the Florentine Renaissance - for example, Leonardo da Vinci's \"aerial perspective\", invented to paint the sky accurately. </p> <p>Botticelli's overwhelming concern is to make the space of Dante's other world real. His first drawing is a map of Dante's hell, visualising it as a hollow cone with tiers - the circles of hell - getting narrower as they descend. Botticelli doesn't just hypothesise this map; he sticks to it. As we follow from drawing to drawing in hell, we feel we are descending; when we get to Mount Purgatory, we ascend. </p> <p>And then there is the body. Learning to take pleasure in the human figure was the most radical way in which the Renaissance subverted the medieval world view. Botticelli's bodies - \"always attractive\", as Pater drooled - are the definition of Renaissance physical beauty. He takes an immense delight in rendering the physical forms of Dante's sinners, demons and devils, all kinds of bodies; Botticelli could never resist a centaur. In his drawing of the snake-headed Gorgons that sneer at Dante and Virgil from the towers of the city of Dis, their faces are cruelly alive, and so are the tiny faces of every snake on their heads. Everyone in Inferno, except for Dante and Virgil, is naked: Botticelli draws genitals, belly buttons, eyes all with the same clinical detail. The sufferings of the various kinds of sinner - the corrupt clergy upside-down in wells, the flaming sarcophagi containing heretics - are hyperlucid. It becomes hypnotic, as your eyes ravenously follow Botticelli's. </p> <p>The 16th-century artist and biographer Vasari, in his life of Botticelli, claims that as well as illustrating the Divine Comedy, Botticelli wrote a commentary on it. Botticelli's interest in Dante was an unhealthy obsession \"on which he wasted much of his time, bringing infinite disorder into his life by neglecting his work\". Botticelli's growing religious passion led him to desert painting, says Vasari, and become a follower of the apocalyptic preacher Savonarola, who predicted the destruction of Florence; the artist's late paintings - particularly his Mystic Nativity in the National Gallery - anticipate the coming apocalypse. It's the intensity of Botticelli's engagement with Dante that makes his drawings unique: he believed this stuff, that our actions will have consequences in eternity. His drawings don't so much illustrate The Divine Comedy as manifest it. There has never been such a partnership of visionaries. </p> <p>\u0095 Botticelli's Dante: the Drawings for The Divine Comedy is at the Royal Academy, London W1 (020-7300 8000) from March 17 to June 10. Blake's Dante can be seen in the William Blake exhibition at Tate Britain, London SW1 (020-7887 8008), until February 11.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At some point in my childhood I became aware that during the second world war, my Turkish grandfather - a Christian hotelier named Joseph Dakad, who lived in Mersin, a port in south-east Turkey - had been imprisoned by the British in Palestine, a place exotically absent from any atlas. A shiver of an explanation accompanied this information: the detention had something to do with spying for the Germans.</p> <p> At around this time, I also learned that my Irish grandfather, James O'Neill, had been jailed by the authorities in Ireland in the course of the same war. Nobody explained precisely why, or where, or for how long, and I foggily attributed his incarceration to the circumstances of a bygone Ireland, a place of cold, adventurous nights and clean-cut valour. This notion was fostered by the two things I knew about Jim O'Neill: that he'd been an expert poacher of salmon on the Bandon river, in west Cork, and that he'd served in the First Battalion, First Cork Brigade, IRA. These were glamorous facts from a gritty world of revolution that was thrillingly distant from the bourgeois, entirely agreeable environment of The Hague, the city where I spent most of my childhood. </p> <p> My grandfathers were barely spoken of in my family, and it was not until I was 30 that the curious parallelism in their lives struck me with any force and that I was driven to explore it. In August 1995, I went to Mersin, which is as humid a spot as you'll find in the Mediter ranean summer, and visited a man named Salvator Avigdor. Sipping a limonata and mopping his brow, he told me that he and his wife were the last two Jews left in Mersin. </p> <p> The synagogue had disappeared, as had the 70 families who lived in the town when he joined the Toros hotel as an 18-year-old in September 1935. This was a time, he said, when Mersin was a marvel, a cosmopolis where you'd hear three words of French, four words of Turkish and three words of Arabic, and when Joseph Dakad, a punctilious but fair boss, would carouse until three or four in the morning, only emerging from his rooms in the hotel loft at noon. In 1940, Avigdor recalled with a sigh, the Toros hotel was the place to be.</p> <p> It had 20 rooms and a first-class restaurant with a chef who had cooked for Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the first president of the Turkish republic. On Sunday nights, there was dancing on the terrace overlooking the sea. The hotel buzzed with Mersin society, travellers and foreign so-called businessmen. Avigdor revealed that the Turkish authorities forced Monsieur Dakad to engage a man - Moharem, by name - who was an agent of the Turkish secret police and whose job it was to spy on the goings-on; that an Austrian resident of Mersin, a friend of my grandfather, was a German agent and quite possibly a double agent of the Turks; and that, in 1940, Avigdor quit his job because the secret police wanted him to intercept letters and inform on the guests staying at the hotel. The most eminent of these was the German ambassador, Franz von Papen. </p> <p> I asked Avigdor whether my grandfather ever expressed opinions about the war. \"Never. It was out of the question. At the hotel, there would be a German here, an Englishman there, and Italian in between. You couldn't open your mouth. You never knew who was working for who.\" \"Do you think my grandfather worked for anyone?\" I asked. \"Well, he was Germanophile, that's for sure. His German was fluent, and he'd speak to the German visitors at the hotel. I personally think that he probably did work for the Germans. You see, once you've given a little information, that's it, you've crossed the line.\"</p> <p> He didn't elaborate on his speculation. \"You must understand, Mersin was an important place. It was full of intrigue, like Lisbon. Mersin,\" he said, pointing upwards, \"was like Casablanca.\" When he said this, I thought, of course, of a man in a white tuxedo who tries to steer a neutral and profitable course through a sea of vultures, gamblers, desperadoes, lovers and idealists. Humphrey Bogart, as the owner of Rick's Caf\u00e9 Am\u00e9ricain, had been almost exactly my grandfather's age, and Casablanca was set in December 1941, which was when Joseph Dakad was running the Toros hotel, just months before his detention by the British authorities in Syria in March 1942. </p> <p> My grandfather was arrested on the train from Jerusalem, where he'd been on a business trip, on suspicion of being an Axis agent. He was initially held in a military prison in Beirut. After repeated suicide attempts, he was transferred to a onastery in Emmaus, Palestine. He remained there until September 1945. His captivity had lasted three and a half years. Jim O'Neill, meanwhile, had been arrested in January 1940. After a spell at Mountjoy prison, he was interned at the Curragh camp, Co Kildare, with other prominent republicans. It was not until November 1944 that he returned to Cork, to his family and the Bandon river. In summer, around Inishannon in west Cork, the Bandon could be a jungle river. Rank, swollen trees - beech, oak, willow, ash, sycamore, horse chestnut, evergreens - gather heavily over the banks, the trunks enveloped by vines and dangling plants. It is here, near Enniskean, that Jim O'Neill was born on the family farm, Ardkitt. </p> <p> By the standards of the Bandon valley, Ardkitt is neither large nor remarkable. There is a front yard; a stone pigpen, now in ruins; an old stone cattleshed; and a whitewashed Victorian farmhouse with a slate roof and yellow-painted trims to the windows and chimney-top and front door. In the secretive way of west Cork, the pastures of Ardkitt, which comprise slightly over 50 acres, are visible only after you have tramped up to the crest of the land rising gently at the rear of the farmhouse. One drizzly November afternoon in 1995, I walked towards the fields of Ardkitt for the first time. Hundreds of small puddles pocked the mud.</p> <p> These wet, empty fields were the site of golden memories for my father. He and the older O'Neill boys, aged about 10, took working holidays on the farm and loved it from the moment they awoke to the moment, at the end of the day, they washed their feet in the cold water of the well. It was idyllic, my father had told me, but all I sensed, standing on the brow of the hill in the rain, was that this was a hard place, a place that exacted hard physical effort. A short while afterwards, I got into the car to leave. My father's brother, Uncle Brendan, who had accompanied me to Ardkitt, was still talking to his cousin Pat O'Neill, who now lived on the farm. </p> <p> Then Pat went into the house and returned with a white towel. He handed it to Brendan. They laughed, and Brendan came over to the car, got into his seat and slammed shut the door. He dropped the towel on my lap. I felt a weight among the folds. I unfolded the towel. A rusted revolver sat between my knees. I looked at my uncle. Colt .45, he said, starting the engine, that's the gun that shot Admiral Somerville. Shortly after nine o'clock on Tuesday March 24 1936, the occupants of The Point, Castletownshend, County Cork - vice- admiral Henry Boyle Townshend Somerville and his wife - heard footsteps on the gravel path outside their dining-room window. \"Perhaps that's one of the boys coming to see you\", said Mrs Somerville, the boys being the young men of the locality who dropped by to ask the admiral's help in joining the British navy. \"I'll go and see,\" her husband said. The cook and the housemaid were out for the evening. There was a knock at the door. Admiral Somerville picked up an oil lamp, crossed the hall, and stepped into the porch at the entrance to the house. Mrs Somerville, who remained in the dining room, heard an indistinct voice outside the glass-panelled front door: \"Are you Mr Somerville?\" \"I am Admiral Somerville.\" </p> <p>His wife heard gunshots and the sound of glass shattering. She grabbed a lamp and rushed into the hall. As she entered, a strong gust of wind blew in through the open door of the porch, extinguishing the flame she carried, leaving her in complete darkness. She called her husband's name - \"Boyle! Boyle!\" - but received no response. All that was audible was the sound of footsteps - the steps of two people was her impression - retreating down the gravel avenue towards the gate of the house. Mrs Somerville advanced in the darkness towards the porch. </p> <p> She saw her husband lying motionless by the doorway among the broken remains of his lamp. Alongside the body was a piece of cardboard on which this message, in letters cut from newspapers, had been glued, \"This British agent has sent 52 boys to the British Army in the last few months.\" At the inquest, four days later, the state solicitor, a Mr T Healy, described Admiral Somerville as \"the descendant of a proud family\", who had fought \"to keep in this country a parliament which had legislated for the entire country, the descendant of one who had disdained rank and wealth in order to fight for that parliament, which legislated for 32 counties and not for a dismembered and partitioned country\". </p> <p> This was a reference to a great-grandfather of the deceased, Charles Kendal Bushe (1767-1843), Lord Chief Justice of Ireland from 1822 to 1842, who spoke in the Dublin parliament in January 1800 against its forthcoming union with the English parliament. People also noted that the admiral's father had been a friend of a local republican hero, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, who died in New York in 1915. On the repatriation of his remains, at Glasnevin cemetery, the republican Patrick Pearse famously proclaimed: \"Life springs from death; and from the graves of patriot men and women spring living nations... The fools, the fools, the fools! They have left us our Fenian dead, and while Ireland holds these graves, Ireland unfree shall never be at peace.\" The suggestion that the admiral was a recruiting agent for the British armed forces was, Healy stated, false. \"He used no influence to get any man or boy into the English navy... No notice or warning was given to the deceased, but instead he was hurled to his death. No stain will lie on the memory of the deceased where he was known, and throughout the country the action which has taken place is abhorrent.\" </p> <p> The killers had fled in a car seen by two schoolgirls driving away from the house at great speed. An investigation began the following day. Castings were taken of the tyre-marks left by the car, photographs and measurements were taken of the scene, fingerprints and footprints were thoroughly examined. A week after the homicide, rumours began to circulate that inquiries had extended into Kerry and that an arrest was imminent. But nobody was ever arrested for the murder of Admiral Somerville. Decades after Somerville's death, the hero of the Anglo-Irish war, Tom Barry, went on record that a Cork IRA squad had been instructed to \"get\" the admiral, but that \"the leader of the IRA squad, not the most stable of men, apparently was carried away, and interpreted his orders quite literally, and shot the admiral dead.\" </p> <p> As for Uncle Brendan, he did not elaborate on his pronouncement about the Colt .45. I didn't press him. Streams of confidential information run underneath all families, but the very integrity of republican families depends on secrecy: mutual, unintrusive loyalty is an essential familial glue - you have to stick together for better or worse, my grandfather would say to his sons. The reservoir of O'Neill republican confidences was Brendan. He was the son my grandfather trusted, to whom he vouchsafed knowledge of certain matters so that Brendan might bear witness to them and, it could be inferred, keep them in memory until they might safely emerge at the lit surface of history. My grandmother could not tell me whether the story about the gun was true We were never told anything, Grandma said. She did, however, remember the hullabaloo that the Somerville shooting caused; and she also knew - from what source, I didn't know - that the car used by the assassins had been finally abandoned at Rathduff, a small village north of Cork city, close by the house of a relative. Not long after the Ardkitt trip, something else surfaced. </p> <p> Breaking a silence he'd kept for a quarter of a century, an uncle by marriage told me that, upon his engagement to my aunt, a fellow remarked to him, \"Do you know you're marrying the daughter of the man who shot Admiral Somerville?\" I claim the privilege, as a grandson, to dwell on my grandfathers in a way of my choosing. I could think of their lives as tragedies. I could linger on the continuing violence and hatred in Turkey and Ireland, and link my grandfathers' shortcomings to the lethal infirmities in those countries' political cultures. But I would rather release my grandfathers. I would rather think of them at ease, and at liberty from mortal emotions. </p> <p>\u00a9 2001 Joseph O'Neill.

      "bodyText": "At some point in my childhood I became aware that during the second world war, my Turkish grandfather - a Christian hotelier named Joseph Dakad, who lived in Mersin, a port in south-east Turkey - had been imprisoned by the British in Palestine, a place exotically absent from any atlas. A shiver of an explanation accompanied this information: the detention had something to do with spying for the Germans. At around this time, I also learned that my Irish grandfather, James O'Neill, had been jailed by the authorities in Ireland in the course of the same war. Nobody explained precisely why, or where, or for how long, and I foggily attributed his incarceration to the circumstances of a bygone Ireland, a place of cold, adventurous nights and clean-cut valour. This notion was fostered by the two things I knew about Jim O'Neill: that he'd been an expert poacher of salmon on the Bandon river, in west Cork, and that he'd served in the First Battalion, First Cork Brigade, IRA. These were glamorous facts from a gritty world of revolution that was thrillingly distant from the bourgeois, entirely agreeable environment of The Hague, the city where I spent most of my childhood. My grandfathers were barely spoken of in my family, and it was not until I was 30 that the curious parallelism in their lives struck me with any force and that I was driven to explore it. In August 1995, I went to Mersin, which is as humid a spot as you'll find in the Mediter ranean summer, and visited a man named Salvator Avigdor. Sipping a limonata and mopping his brow, he told me that he and his wife were the last two Jews left in Mersin. The synagogue had disappeared, as had the 70 families who lived in the town when he joined the Toros hotel as an 18-year-old in September 1935. This was a time, he said, when Mersin was a marvel, a cosmopolis where you'd hear three words of French, four words of Turkish and three words of Arabic, and when Joseph Dakad, a punctilious but fair boss, would carouse until three or four in the morning, only emerging from his rooms in the hotel loft at noon. In 1940, Avigdor recalled with a sigh, the Toros hotel was the place to be. It had 20 rooms and a first-class restaurant with a chef who had cooked for Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the first president of the Turkish republic. On Sunday nights, there was dancing on the terrace overlooking the sea. The hotel buzzed with Mersin society, travellers and foreign so-called businessmen. Avigdor revealed that the Turkish authorities forced Monsieur Dakad to engage a man - Moharem, by name - who was an agent of the Turkish secret police and whose job it was to spy on the goings-on; that an Austrian resident of Mersin, a friend of my grandfather, was a German agent and quite possibly a double agent of the Turks; and that, in 1940, Avigdor quit his job because the secret police wanted him to intercept letters and inform on the guests staying at the hotel. The most eminent of these was the German ambassador, Franz von Papen. I asked Avigdor whether my grandfather ever expressed opinions about the war. \"Never. It was out of the question. At the hotel, there would be a German here, an Englishman there, and Italian in between. You couldn't open your mouth. You never knew who was working for who.\" \"Do you think my grandfather worked for anyone?\" I asked. \"Well, he was Germanophile, that's for sure. His German was fluent, and he'd speak to the German visitors at the hotel. I personally think that he probably did work for the Germans. You see, once you've given a little information, that's it, you've crossed the line.\" He didn't elaborate on his speculation. \"You must understand, Mersin was an important place. It was full of intrigue, like Lisbon. Mersin,\" he said, pointing upwards, \"was like Casablanca.\" When he said this, I thought, of course, of a man in a white tuxedo who tries to steer a neutral and profitable course through a sea of vultures, gamblers, desperadoes, lovers and idealists. Humphrey Bogart, as the owner of Rick's Caf\u00e9 Am\u00e9ricain, had been almost exactly my grandfather's age, and Casablanca was set in December 1941, which was when Joseph Dakad was running the Toros hotel, just months before his detention by the British authorities in Syria in March 1942.

With impeccable timing, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is holding its largest exhibition, Made in California: Art, Image and Identity 1900-2000, while this week in Anaheim, Disney opened its newest theme park called California Adventure, which focuses on everything from the Golden Gate to Hollywood and the state's famous redwood forests. </p> <p> California's literature has also come under scrutiny, with the publication of a new survey of the writing of the region.

They're suspicious of the beautiful fa\u00e7ade; they like to look behind it and see nothing there. (A good therapist would recognise this as a violent defence mechanism set off by fear of rejection: am I cool enough?

Eventually a compromise was agreed, which allowed the gallery's attendants to open the car door and show the illicit sex, provided there were no minors present.

Those boundaries have been erased and California can largely take the credit - or blame - for that. </p> <p>The exhibition's title makes it clear that this is not just about art but about the image and identity that have created such ambivalent feelings towards California and what it represents in the collective cultural psyche. The images that flash past in the chronological journey through the exhibition are the images that have flashed past the world: the surfer and the gangster, the palm tree and the pool - here represented by David Hockney's The Splash (1966) - Mickey Mouse and the fruit-pickers, Grateful Dead posters and topless bathing suits, Black Panthers and Mexican borders, Muscle Beach and missions. </p> <p>\"California has invented so much of the postmodern world that most places are packing away their idiosyncracies in order to more closely resemble California,\" writes Richard Rodriguez in the fat book that accompanies the exhibition. \"California has for so long played America's America.

This was \"the new Eden of the Saxon home-seeker,\" said the founder of the Southwest Museum, Charles Fletcher Lummis. Americans who suffered from tuberculosis or asthma came in their thousands to Pasadena and Ojai and Palm Springs. Then with the entry of the US into the first world war in 1917 came the boost to the economy through food and clothes production. For those seeking spiritual refreshment, California provided some of the most charismatic religious hucksters imaginable; one of them, Aimee Semple McPherson, the evangelist who died of a drug overdose in 1944, is commemorated in the exhibition by Barse Miller's satirical Apparition Over Los Angeles. </p> <p>The state in the early years of the last century had an almost mystical view of itself as a Rome or an Athens, a place that would define the future and be the birthplace of the new. Although it might have been the \"Saxon home-seeker\" who was encouraged, in the early silent films there were stars like Anna May Wong and Dolores Del Rio - both celebrated in the exhibition - who demonstrated that California's special magic was that it stood at the crossroads between east and west, between Latin America and the English-speaking north. </p> <p>So amongst the dreamy landscapes and the beach culture, there is Diego Rivera's Allegory of California from 1931 and Frederic Penney's Madonna of Chavez Ravine.

To the east-coast literary establishment, a book party in LA is an oxymoron. Californians use books merely as drinks coasters, goes the joke. In a NY Times review of the new collection of Raymond Carver's prose, Call if You Need Me, Claire Dederer writes of the earlier Carver work, Short Cuts, and how it was turned into a film by Robert Altman: \"Altman captured Carver's mood of crummy, slipshod marginality and cleverly relocated it to Los Angeles, the world capital of crumminess.\" What other city in the world gets lumbered with such a sneering, lazy, cliched nickname as Tinseltown? </p> <p>Last month also saw the publication of The Literature of California Volume One, 870 pages of writing edited by Maxine Hong Kingston, Jack Hicks, James D Houston and Al Young.

With impeccable timing, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is holding its largest exhibition, Made in California: Art, Image and Identity 1900-2000, while this week in Anaheim, Disney opened its newest theme park called California Adventure, which focuses on everything from the Golden Gate to Hollywood and the state's famous redwood forests. California's literature has also come under scrutiny, with the publication of a new survey of the writing of the region. Each project aims to define the condition of a state that seems at once both America squared and yet very specifically a country of its own. When the New Yorker ran a special edition on California three years ago, Alex Ross described the relationship that other Americans have with the state as \"one that takes on the inflections of a resentful sibling or a jilted lover. They're suspicious of the beautiful fa\u00e7ade; they like to look behind it and see nothing there. (A good therapist would recognise this as a violent defence mechanism set off by fear of rejection: am I cool enough? Am I cute enough?)\" Recently in LA Weekly, the city's main radical paper, Harold Myerson wrote in an essay on Bush and Clinton: \"To Democrats, Republicans are a bunch of Texans who pollute the earth.

Although a Briton, a Belgian and a Canadian have confessed on Saudi television to two of the bombings, and nine other foreigners are under arrest, the prince's move casts doubt on whether they are the real culprits, Saad Fagih of the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia said yesterday. All 12 suspects, as well as the victims of two car bombs in Riyadh on November 17 and 22 last year, have been linked to illicit drinking activities in the Saudi capital. But the authorities have offered no explanation for three subsequent bombs. On December 5, a Scotsman, David Brown, lost an eye when a juice carton placed near his car's windscreen exploded in the eastern town of al-Khobar. On January 10, a small explosion occurred in a telephone kiosk outside the Euromarche shopping mall in Riyadh. Four days later, police defused a bomb found under an Irishman's car in Riyadh. Almost all the western suspects were under arrest when the two most recent incidents occurred. Prince Nayef, the interior minister, has always taken his safety seriously, but the doubling of his bodyguard followed the discovery of a note at the scene of the Euromarche bombing, Dr Fagih said. He added that two different sources had told him that the bombers' note had warned that there would be another, much larger, explosion if Prince Nayef did not release their \"brothers\". Besides the 12 foreigners, the authorities are holding about 70 \"mojahedin youths\" in connection with the bombings. Meanwhile Gary Dixon, the Briton who ran the Empire drinking club in Riyadh, was yesterday trying to launch a last-minute appeal against his deportation from Dubai to Saudi Arabia on alcohol-related charges.

      "body": "<p>Chris Akers, the entrepreneur behind a string of sports, media and internet-related company flotations, is struggling to pull one of his latest stock market vehicles out of severe financial difficulties. </p> <p>EuroTelecom, a firm that specialises in installing hi-tech internet facilities in commercial buildings, said yesterday that it had \"working capital difficulties\" nine months after Mr Akers, as non-executive chairman, helped it raise \u00a317m through an AIM flotation. </p> <p>The announcement wiped 33% off EuroTelecom's share price and they closed the day valued at 6p each. It left several investors who had bought into the flotation at more than 150p per share seething. The firm is understood to have around \u00a31m left but has reduced cash burn from around \u00a31.5m per month to \u00a3250,000. </p> <p>\"I want to know what the hell has happened,\" said one angry investor. \"We were told that this firm had no burn rate and yet now there's cash difficulties. You don't get into a flotation and expect this to happen.\" </p> <p>Phil Derry, chief executive of the company, said it was \"in discussions with parties which may or may not lead to an injection of funds\". </p> <p>Asked if he thought the company would go bust he said: \"We need a fair wind but I don't think so. I'm confident we can sort something out. We've invested heavily in infrastructure and have a substantial order book. I think we've got an interesting company.\" </p> <p>The board is thought to be deeply split over the way the company has been run. Mr Akers and Mr Derry are thought to be at loggerheads and at the end of last year the former asked accountants BDO Stoy Hayward to conduct a financial audit of the accounts. </p> <p>Two directors Amanda Staveley and David Walton announced on Thursday that they were quitting the board. A fortnight ago finance director David Linell, who clashed with non-executives, announced his resignation due to \"pressures of his other business interests\". </p> <p>In October the company reported sales of \u00a36.5m but operating losses of \u00a33.7m were higher than original forecasts. At that stage it had around \u00a35m in the bank and had won contracts including an order to wire Microsoft's campus in Cambridge and the Printworks development in Manchester. </p> <p>EuroTelecom's difficulties and the anger expressed by some of its shareholders will be a blow for Mr Akers, who experienced the most successful period of his business career last year. </p> <p>He bounced back from a bitter power struggle at Leeds United football club that saw him quit as chairman. He sold his Sports Internet vehicle to BSkyB for \u00a3301m and helped to build InTechnology, a data storage firm that was one of the best performing shares of last year. </p> <p>Those performances built him a loyal following among investors. </p> <p>Since then Mr Akers has floated Newsplayer.com, I Feel Good and Sports Resource. Shares in Newsplayer are currently changing hands at half the level they first fetched. IFeelGood, run by former Loaded magazine editor James Brown, has seen its shares recover after a disappointing start. </p> <p>Sports Resource has seen its shares perform strongly.</p>",

The announcement wiped 33% off EuroTelecom's share price and they closed the day valued at 6p each. It left several investors who had bought into the flotation at more than 150p per share seething. The firm is understood to have around \u00a31m left but has reduced cash burn from around \u00a31.5m per month to \u00a3250,000. \"I want to know what the hell has happened,\" said one angry investor. \"We were told that this firm had no burn rate and yet now there's cash difficulties. You don't get into a flotation and expect this to happen.\" Phil Derry, chief executive of the company, said it was \"in discussions with parties which may or may not lead to an injection of funds\". Asked if he thought the company would go bust he said: \"We need a fair wind but I don't think so. I'm confident we can sort something out. We've invested heavily in infrastructure and have a substantial order book. I think we've got an interesting company.\" The board is thought to be deeply split over the way the company has been run. Mr Akers and Mr Derry are thought to be at loggerheads and at the end of last year the former asked accountants BDO Stoy Hayward to conduct a financial audit of the accounts. Two directors Amanda Staveley and David Walton announced on Thursday that they were quitting the board. A fortnight ago finance director David Linell, who clashed with non-executives, announced his resignation due to \"pressures of his other business interests\". In October the company reported sales of \u00a36.5m but operating losses of \u00a33.7m were higher than original forecasts. At that stage it had around \u00a35m in the bank and had won contracts including an order to wire Microsoft's campus in Cambridge and the Printworks development in Manchester. EuroTelecom's difficulties and the anger expressed by some of its shareholders will be a blow for Mr Akers, who experienced the most successful period of his business career last year. He bounced back from a bitter power struggle at Leeds United football club that saw him quit as chairman. He sold his Sports Internet vehicle to BSkyB for \u00a3301m and helped to build InTechnology, a data storage firm that was one of the best performing shares of last year. Those performances built him a loyal following among investors. Since then Mr Akers has floated Newsplayer.com, I Feel Good and Sports Resource. Shares in Newsplayer are currently changing hands at half the level they first fetched. IFeelGood, run by former Loaded magazine editor James Brown, has seen its shares recover after a disappointing start. Sports Resource has seen its shares perform strongly.",

      "body": "<p>Bill Clinton's exit from the White House had been planned and orchestrated as a glittering valediction - full of extended and reflective interviews, a deluge of dynamic presidential executive orders and appointments, and a sentimental tour of farewell speeches delivered in iconic sites from the Clinton years such as Little Rock, Arkansas, and Dover, New Hampshire.</p> <p>Right up to the last moment on January 20, there was even the tantalising hope that it might yet be crowned by something grander still, that Mr Clinton might even be able to work the personal magic one last time and somehow conjure a Middle East deal from the embers of the collapsing Oslo peace process, thus providing the elusive cornerstone of what he hoped would be his \"legacy\".</p> <p>Yet an increasingly incredulous, and now increasingly angry, Democratic party has watched as the intended triumph has morphed into an unintended disaster, and the couple who have been seen for so long as the masters of modern political choreography have presided over a public relations debacle.</p> <p>In the first days after George W Bush's accession, it seemed hard to believe that things could get much worse for the Clintons. The 42nd president left the White House still haunted by his affair with Monica Lewinsky, in the shadow of the eleventh-hour plea-bargain brilliantly executed by the independent counsel Robert Ray as the removal vans were being loaded outside.</p> <p>Then there were the pardons, the ink scarcely dry on the list as the Bushes drove up to the White House for pre-inaugural coffee. After that there came the revelations about the gifts. Most devastatingly of all, the Clintons stood accused of accepting two coffee tables and chairs from Denise Rich, the New York Democratic fundraiser and former wife of the disgraced financier Marc Rich, whose pardon was widely seen as inexplicable in any terms other than as payback. And then the vandalism rumours started to circulate.</p> <p>Exactly what happened in the White House and the neighbouring Old Executive Office Building in which most of the presidential and vice-presidential staff have their offices in those final hours of the Clinton-Gore administration still remains unclear. That some isolated vandalism took place - silly pranks like the case of the missing Ws, for instance - is beyond doubt. That it never matched up to the wilder claims about pornography and glued filing cabinets seems almost equally likely.</p> <p>What is certain is that the rumours triggered an eruption of venom from the professional Clinton-haters. \"I had promised myself not to write again about Bill Clinton - not to give the Big Creep the satisfaction of publicity,\" wrote the conservative Fox TV anchorman Tony Snow \"but the Man From Hope couldn't resist the temptation to give us one last White Trash Weekend.\" And that was among the more polite comments.</p> <p>For a few days, the US media gorged itself on the Clintons one last time, reporting fiction as certainty and sloppily elevating gossip into established truth. The plundering of Air Force One turned out to have been grossly exaggerated. The value of the gifts removed by the Clintons was little different from those removed by earlier presidents and was dwarfed by the $2m (\u00a31.4m) home with which admirers presented Ronald Reagan when he left the presidency in 1989. Clinton's list of pardons was not greatly different from those of his predecessors.</p> <p>Yet two wrongs did not make a right. A lot of the stories were fact not fiction. And the way that the Clintons have subsequently handled the spiralling scandals has revealed a ham-fisted touch that is the more incredible because it comes from a couple whose supposed mastery of media relations spawned a host of international imitators, not least in Tony Blair's Labour party.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the Clintons announced that they were returning $28,000 (\u00a319,000) worth of furnishings. The reason? A succession of donors had discovered that the gifts they had intended for the White House had ended up in Clintons' home in Chappaqua in the New York suburbs. Some said they were offended. \"I would never give a gift to the Clintons,\" claimed businessman Brad Noe, after learning that his $3,000 (\u00a32,000) sofa was on the list.</p> <p>This Thursday one of the Republican party's arch Clinton-haters, Congressman Dan Burton of Indiana, took his chance to turn the knife in the wound. His government reform committee conducted an all-day grilling of Eric Holder, the Clinton administration justice department official, and Mr Rich's lawyer Jack Quinn in an attempt to squeeze the last drop from the shady Rich pardon deal.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, the New York Times described the pardon for a man who is accused of defrauding the US Treasury of $48m (\u00a333m) as \"a shocking abuse of presidential power and a reminder of why George W Bush's vow to restore integrity to the Oval Office resonates with millions of Americans who otherwise disagree with the new president's politics\".</p> <p>\"Knowing everything that I know now, I would not have recommended to the president that he grant the pardon,\" Mr Holder, formerly deputy attorney general to the departed Janet Reno, told the Burton committee. As he did so, one Republican staffer looked to be rubbing his hands in glee.</p> <p>The nation's most senior Republican, Mr Bush avoids such ostentatious behaviour. He has no need for it. By standing above the swirling allegations against his predecessor, Mr Bush is collecting a richer political dividend than seemed possible three weeks ago at his subdued inauguration. Mr Bush's first opinion poll approval ratings this week came in at 57%, not a bad score, especially after his controversial election. He has the Clintons to thank for it.</p> <p>On the other side of the political divide the disbelief is palpable. \"We find ourselves with a Democratic party that is being defined by the actions of Bill Clinton as he left office,\" California congresswoman Maxine Waters said this week. \"I don't know how long this goes on.\"</p> <p>If that question nags at Mrs Waters, then it is also providing a deafening background to Mrs Clinton's early weeks in the US senate. Once again, it is open season on Hillary, as Republican and Democratic enemies alike try to kick her while she is down.

      "bodyText": "Bill Clinton's exit from the White House had been planned and orchestrated as a glittering valediction - full of extended and reflective interviews, a deluge of dynamic presidential executive orders and appointments, and a sentimental tour of farewell speeches delivered in iconic sites from the Clinton years such as Little Rock, Arkansas, and Dover, New Hampshire. Right up to the last moment on January 20, there was even the tantalising hope that it might yet be crowned by something grander still, that Mr Clinton might even be able to work the personal magic one last time and somehow conjure a Middle East deal from the embers of the collapsing Oslo peace process, thus providing the elusive cornerstone of what he hoped would be his \"legacy\". Yet an increasingly incredulous, and now increasingly angry, Democratic party has watched as the intended triumph has morphed into an unintended disaster, and the couple who have been seen for so long as the masters of modern political choreography have presided over a public relations debacle. In the first days after George W Bush's accession, it seemed hard to believe that things could get much worse for the Clintons. The 42nd president left the White House still haunted by his affair with Monica Lewinsky, in the shadow of the eleventh-hour plea-bargain brilliantly executed by the independent counsel Robert Ray as the removal vans were being loaded outside. Then there were the pardons, the ink scarcely dry on the list as the Bushes drove up to the White House for pre-inaugural coffee. After that there came the revelations about the gifts. Most devastatingly of all, the Clintons stood accused of accepting two coffee tables and chairs from Denise Rich, the New York Democratic fundraiser and former wife of the disgraced financier Marc Rich, whose pardon was widely seen as inexplicable in any terms other than as payback. And then the vandalism rumours started to circulate. Exactly what happened in the White House and the neighbouring Old Executive Office Building in which most of the presidential and vice-presidential staff have their offices in those final hours of the Clinton-Gore administration still remains unclear. That some isolated vandalism took place - silly pranks like the case of the missing Ws, for instance - is beyond doubt. That it never matched up to the wilder claims about pornography and glued filing cabinets seems almost equally likely. What is certain is that the rumours triggered an eruption of venom from the professional Clinton-haters. \"I had promised myself not to write again about Bill Clinton - not to give the Big Creep the satisfaction of publicity,\" wrote the conservative Fox TV anchorman Tony Snow \"but the Man From Hope couldn't resist the temptation to give us one last White Trash Weekend.\" And that was among the more polite comments. For a few days, the US media gorged itself on the Clintons one last time, reporting fiction as certainty and sloppily elevating gossip into established truth. The plundering of Air Force One turned out to have been grossly exaggerated. The value of the gifts removed by the Clintons was little different from those removed by earlier presidents and was dwarfed by the $2m (\u00a31.4m) home with which admirers presented Ronald Reagan when he left the presidency in 1989. Clinton's list of pardons was not greatly different from those of his predecessors. Yet two wrongs did not make a right. A lot of the stories were fact not fiction. And the way that the Clintons have subsequently handled the spiralling scandals has revealed a ham-fisted touch that is the more incredible because it comes from a couple whose supposed mastery of media relations spawned a host of international imitators, not least in Tony Blair's Labour party. On Wednesday, the Clintons announced that they were returning $28,000 (\u00a319,000) worth of furnishings. The reason? A succession of donors had discovered that the gifts they had intended for the White House had ended up in Clintons' home in Chappaqua in the New York suburbs. Some said they were offended. \"I would never give a gift to the Clintons,\" claimed businessman Brad Noe, after learning that his $3,000 (\u00a32,000) sofa was on the list. This Thursday one of the Republican party's arch Clinton-haters, Congressman Dan Burton of Indiana, took his chance to turn the knife in the wound. His government reform committee conducted an all-day grilling of Eric Holder, the Clinton administration justice department official, and Mr Rich's lawyer Jack Quinn in an attempt to squeeze the last drop from the shady Rich pardon deal. Two weeks ago, the New York Times described the pardon for a man who is accused of defrauding the US Treasury of $48m (\u00a333m) as \"a shocking abuse of presidential power and a reminder of why George W Bush's vow to restore integrity to the Oval Office resonates with millions of Americans who otherwise disagree with the new president's politics\". \"Knowing everything that I know now, I would not have recommended to the president that he grant the pardon,\" Mr Holder, formerly deputy attorney general to the departed Janet Reno, told the Burton committee. As he did so, one Republican staffer looked to be rubbing his hands in glee. The nation's most senior Republican, Mr Bush avoids such ostentatious behaviour. He has no need for it. By standing above the swirling allegations against his predecessor, Mr Bush is collecting a richer political dividend than seemed possible three weeks ago at his subdued inauguration. Mr Bush's first opinion poll approval ratings this week came in at 57%, not a bad score, especially after his controversial election. He has the Clintons to thank for it. On the other side of the political divide the disbelief is palpable. \"We find ourselves with a Democratic party that is being defined by the actions of Bill Clinton as he left office,\" California congresswoman Maxine Waters said this week. \"I don't know how long this goes on.\" If that question nags at Mrs Waters, then it is also providing a deafening background to Mrs Clinton's early weeks in the US senate. Once again, it is open season on Hillary, as Republican and Democratic enemies alike try to kick her while she is down. Everything from her hair to her ethics is grist to the mill. \"They should just lay off. Come pick on some of the rest of us,\" Democratic Senator Kent Conrad pleaded this week. Not surprisingly, his request has gone unanswered. For Bill and Hillary Clinton the three weeks since January 20 have been a time that you would not wish upon your greatest political enemies. Except that those words exactly describe how the Republican party establishment have seen the Clintons for the past eight years - so the rulers of the new US domestic order are loving every minute of the ongoing humiliation of the former first couple. Gifts, pardons and White House trash January 19 On Bill Clinton's last full day as president he strikes a deal with independent counsel Robert Ray. Charges are dropped in return for Clinton's admission of false testimony over Monica Lewinsky, five years' loss of his Arkansas legal licence and a $25,000 fine January 20 Two hours before leaving the White House, Clinton announces 176 pardons and commutations, including former CIA director John Deutch, heiress/ terrorist Patty Hearst, Whitewater chum Susan McDougal, brother Roger Clinton and fugitive financier Marc Rich. At noon, George Bush is sworn in. Bill and Hillary Clinton leave the White House with $190,000 worth of gifts acquired during their eight-year residence. The Clintons fly to New York aboard Air Force One for the last time January 23 First rumour that Clinton staff systematically removed W-keys from White House keyboards January 24 Claims that Air Force One was \"stripped bare\" of memorabilia during final Clinton flight to New York January 25 Allegations about \"trashing\" of White House grow with claims of graffiti, pornography, glued filing cabinets - and possible charges against Clinton and Gore staff for $60,000 worth of damage January 26 Bush White House says no formal investigation of trashing claims January 30 Clinton reported to be asking for $624,000 from public funds to pay for office space in midtown Manhattan February 2 Clintons announce that they will pay for $86,000 worth of the gifts they took with them from the White House. Clinton announces that his foundation will pay $339,000 towards the rent of his new offices; the rest will come from public funds February 3 Clinton fundraiser Terry McAuliffe becomes new chairman of the Democratic party. February 5 Clinton lectures financial services convention for $100,000 fee February 7 Newspapers report Clinton argument with Al Gore in December about blame for loss of the White House. Clintons announce they are returning $28,000 worth of earlier gifts after donors said they intended them for the White House February 8 House of Representatives government reform committee holds full day of public hearings into Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich Martin Kettle",

Monday, February 5 I rang Greg Dyke's office at 7am this morning, but the slug-a-bed was not at his bed. Do we licence-payers award a full-time salary to a man who apparently works part-time? It would appear so. Mr Elf warned me against taking out an injunction against the BBC. He said, \"It would be a David and Goliath situation.\" I pointed out to him that little David was in fact the victor against the giant Goliath. Elf replied, \"In my opinion, David struck lucky with that stone. Goliath obviously had a very thin skull.\" Tanya Braithwaite brought last week's Radio Times around this morning. Inside, was a \"film-set diary\" purported to have been written by a bloke calling himself Adrian Mole. This Mole bloke was also upset that his life was being exploited. A friend of Tanya's in publishing had told her that an old hack called Sue Townsend had been trying for years to publish the secret diaries of Adrian Mole, claiming that they were fiction. She showed me a piece of the manuscript. I read in increasing astonishment as details of my private life were revealed. How does this woman know so much about me? Is she tapping my phone? Has she bugged my house? Tanya said that Townsend grew bitter after going on an Arvon poetry course led by Adrian Henri and Roger McGough, where Henri told her that she was not a poet and never would be after she handed in a poem called A Contemplation Regarding Earwig Defecation: How to measure earwig poo? How to know how much they do? Are there scales to measure it Those tiny piles of earwig shit? Townsend then made a hysterical denunciation of modern poetry and ran out of the class and down to the river. She threatened to throw herself in unless Adrian Henri sent her earwig poem to Bloodaxe with a recommendation that they commission a thick volume of her verse. Adrian Henri came to the opposite bank and shouted across the river, \"Throw yourself in and give us all a break.\" Townsend has hated all men called Adrian since that day. AA Gill is another of her obsessions. Is she the reason my own literary endeavours have come to nought? Tuesday, February 6 Leicester-born painter Adrian Hemming has fled the country after hearing that Townsend is an admirer of his work. \"I heard that she was planning to buy one of my 'wave' pictures and hang it in her bathroom,\" he said from his hiding place. \"I must protect my name.\"",

      "body": "<p> A delivery man turned up recently smelling strongly of cheroots. I sent him on his way as quickly as I could, but not before he had thrust into my hands a bottle of Domaine de la Citadelle Cabernet Sauvignon 1999 from the Hull merchants, House of Townend. The next day, I opened the wine, expecting no great shakes (it had a ticket tied to its neck saying, 'Try me, please'). I smelled it and thought, 'Hmm, could be a fifth-growth Pauillac in a ripe year, or perhaps a second in a difficult vintage.' Then I tasted it: 'Youthful . . . but marvellous!' </p> <p>There was an immediate elegance about the fruit, terrific blackberry typicity with a bitter-chocolate undertone cut by a charred richness. (Indeed, I wondered if the fumacious delivery man had not passed on his aroma to the wine.) This was nothing like Bordeaux now. This was a real thrill as it coursed over the tastebuds and caressed the back of the throat. The tannins were civilised and courtly, but what was truly fine about the wine was its texture and weight of attack. It has subtlety yet muscle, litheness yet strength, personality with a delicious, unforced rotundity of expression. It truly was like velvet. If only Bordeaux could widely produce cabernets such as this, for the same money, then it could truly claim to be the greatest in the world. </p> <p>Domaine de la Citadelle rates 17.5 points out of 20. It is available via the House of Townend website (hotwine.com) for \u00a34.49. This includes VAT, and minimum delivery is a dozen bottles. It s also available by mail-order for \u00a34.99 by telephoning 01482 586582. Or you can get it via House of Townend retail outlets around Hull, whose citizens, in mourning ever since the departure of Larkin, have something to celebrate again. </p> <p>Majestic also has some highly agreeable new reds. Bethany Grenache 1999 (16 points, \u00a36.49) is unusually dry for an Aussie, but the finish delivers lovely echoes of rich fruitiness. Bethany Shiraz Cabernet 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a37.99) has more tobacco and depth than its grenache cousin - a touch of spice, too. Mas Collet Celler de Capcanes 1998 (17 points, \u00a35.99), from Spain, is a stunning bargain, parading gripping tannins alongside fruit that has overtones of tobacco, dried fruits and coffee.

      "bodyText": "A delivery man turned up recently smelling strongly of cheroots. I sent him on his way as quickly as I could, but not before he had thrust into my hands a bottle of Domaine de la Citadelle Cabernet Sauvignon 1999 from the Hull merchants, House of Townend. The next day, I opened the wine, expecting no great shakes (it had a ticket tied to its neck saying, 'Try me, please'). I smelled it and thought, 'Hmm, could be a fifth-growth Pauillac in a ripe year, or perhaps a second in a difficult vintage.' Then I tasted it: 'Youthful . . . but marvellous!' There was an immediate elegance about the fruit, terrific blackberry typicity with a bitter-chocolate undertone cut by a charred richness. (Indeed, I wondered if the fumacious delivery man had not passed on his aroma to the wine.) This was nothing like Bordeaux now. This was a real thrill as it coursed over the tastebuds and caressed the back of the throat. The tannins were civilised and courtly, but what was truly fine about the wine was its texture and weight of attack. It has subtlety yet muscle, litheness yet strength, personality with a delicious, unforced rotundity of expression. It truly was like velvet. If only Bordeaux could widely produce cabernets such as this, for the same money, then it could truly claim to be the greatest in the world. Domaine de la Citadelle rates 17.5 points out of 20. It is available via the House of Townend website (hotwine.com) for \u00a34.49. This includes VAT, and minimum delivery is a dozen bottles. It s also available by mail-order for \u00a34.99 by telephoning 01482 586582. Or you can get it via House of Townend retail outlets around Hull, whose citizens, in mourning ever since the departure of Larkin, have something to celebrate again. Majestic also has some highly agreeable new reds. Bethany Grenache 1999 (16 points, \u00a36.49) is unusually dry for an Aussie, but the finish delivers lovely echoes of rich fruitiness. Bethany Shiraz Cabernet 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a37.99) has more tobacco and depth than its grenache cousin - a touch of spice, too. Mas Collet Celler de Capcanes 1998 (17 points, \u00a35.99), from Spain, is a stunning bargain, parading gripping tannins alongside fruit that has overtones of tobacco, dried fruits and coffee. Costers del Gravet Celler de Capcanes 1998 (17 points, \u00a38.99, also available at Oddbins) has more sweet fruit than the Mas Collet, but a touch more elegance and finesse. Lirac Les Esperelles Chteau d'Aqueria 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a36.49) offers an exciting clash of sweet, soft fruit and seriously deep tannins.

More and more gardens and woodlands are opening to the public at what they hope will be the best time of year, but anything can happen, including vile conditions on the day.</p> <p>However, galanthophiles, as they like to call themselves - lovers of galanthus (snowdrop) - are tough, and they are prepared to spend a few hours of acute discomfort examining minute differences between cultivars. Twenty to 30 new ones appear each year, nearly all arising from chance seedlings. They will flatter the owner by being named after themselves or their spouse, their home or village, or some reference point that means a lot to them but nothing to the rest of us. It's all a little too easy, or so it seems to me.</p> <p>\"I think I like my snowdrops straight,\" garden designer John Codrington once said to me, and one can see his point. They love our climate and in many areas (especially in Scotland) they have become densely naturalised over large acres of woodland. Deer, rabbits and other pests don't touch them; squirrels merely move them around, thereby increasing their territory. Despite its success here as a species, the snowdrop is probably not a true native. (Its ability to establish itself, however, has prompted much debate on the subject.)</p> <p>The emergence of these flowers is the first wholehearted evidence that winter is on its way out. That said, a few species flower in autumn or early winter, and there is nothing in the way of a cheat about this. It just comes naturally to them. Others flower so late that they may easily run into April. So, one way or another, they give us a good spread and plenty of opportunities on a garden scale to grow them in combination with a number of other early flowers. Or they can bloom with summer-performing perennials, always provided you do not have to replant or in other ways disturb the area too often. Some disturbance every five years or so may actually be beneficial, because some snowdrops, grown in cultivated ground, increase at such a rate that their bulbs diminish in size, push each other out of the ground and eventually kill themselves. The good news is that, when naturalised in turf, the snowdrop's overcrowding problem (if it can be called one) is less obvious.</p> <p>The early-flowering 'Atkinsii', which is tall, with long, teardrop-shaped flowers, never sets seed but is immensely prolific, so that you can build up stock at great speed. Of course, it is easy to understand how people get hooked. You see a different one that appeals to you and, naturally, want it. But that is different from being bitten by the snowdrop bug and avidly collecting. I might have 20 identifiable kinds, but a genuine nutter might have upwards of 300 and still be far from sated.</p> <p>The collecting instinct is so natural to many of us (better snowdrops than stamps, I should say) that it would be pointless to be sniffy about it, but galanthophiles can easily become galanthobores. There is a kind of vanity involved. If you can make yourself an expert in your subject, however narrow it may be, you have a vantage point. And if it really means so much to you, chances are that you are, overall, a bit of a bore.</p> <p>None of which should in any way tarnish the delights provided by snowdrops. They do command pretty colossal prices - \u00a320 for one bulb seems quite a lot to pay. Two enthusiasts, interviewed for an article in the Royal Horticultural Society journal, The Garden, are reported to have said that neither of them \"uses any commercial methods of propagation to increase their snowdrop stock. They prefer to rely on nature.\" That, surely, is sheer snobbery, suggesting that there is, by definition, something a bit underhand about commerce and that its methods are of necessity not nice.</p> <p>Had these same enthusiasts been trained to be handy with a knife and to practise the basically quite simple techniques for increasing stock more quickly than Dame Nature manages, they would be singing a different tune. The practice of scooping out a bulb's base-plate and then giving it warm, moist conditions, so that it fairly quickly starts to make little bulbils around the rim of the cut, is very old (particularly on hyacinths) and the more rapid increase of valuable stock that it enables is of great benefit to us all. Ignorance has a lot to answer for. It is often inevitable, but nothing to take pride in.</p> <p>Another point to make about the spate of newly-named snowdrops is that, while they may be curious, they are often downright ugly - far from an improvement.</p> <p>Nothing will turn me off growing snowdrops. I want more and more of them, and am constantly cudgelling my brains to think of new places where they will be both happy and appropriate. If we want to divide or move them around, there is no better moment than immediately after they have flowered</p> <p><b> Drop goals</b><br></p> <p><b> For success with snowdrops</b></p> <p>\u0095 Get hold of good-quality bulbs: freshly dug ones are always the best, as dry bulbs will take much longer to flower.</p> <p>\u0095 Plant 7.5cm deep in dappled shade during September/October.</p> <p>\u0095 Snowdrop bulbs are at their happiest in a clay/humus-rich soil that will be damp in winter and spring and dry during the summer. Top dress them lightly with compost or leaf mould.</p> <p>\u0095 For reliability, choose from the more vigorous varieties, such as Galanthus 'S. Arnott', 'Atkinsii' and 'Magnet'.</p> <p>\u0095 If growing snowdrops indoors, keep them on a cool, north-facing windowsill. Heat causes bulbs to go blind (ie, fail to develop flower buds).</p> <p>\u0095 Plant pots from indoors outside, and divide clumps outdoors after flowering.</p> <p><b> What to avoid</b> <br></p> <p>\u0095 Infestation of narcissus flies - their grubs eat developing flower buds.</p> <p>\u0095 Holes left by dying leaves - rake the soil lightly to fill them in. Also, you could try dusting the soil with pirimphos-methyl before planting.</p> <p>\u0095 Very acid, rich or free-draining soil, or thick grassland.</p> <p>\u0095 Bulbs that show any leaf distortion or grey mould.</p> <p>\u0095 Don't dig up bulbs from the wild: snowdrops, like other native flora, have suffered greatly as a result of such thieving.</p> <p>\u0095 Research by Patrick Driscall</p>",

The emergence of these flowers is the first wholehearted evidence that winter is on its way out. That said, a few species flower in autumn or early winter, and there is nothing in the way of a cheat about this. It just comes naturally to them. Others flower so late that they may easily run into April. So, one way or another, they give us a good spread and plenty of opportunities on a garden scale to grow them in combination with a number of other early flowers. Or they can bloom with summer-performing perennials, always provided you do not have to replant or in other ways disturb the area too often. Some disturbance every five years or so may actually be beneficial, because some snowdrops, grown in cultivated ground, increase at such a rate that their bulbs diminish in size, push each other out of the ground and eventually kill themselves. The good news is that, when naturalised in turf, the snowdrop's overcrowding problem (if it can be called one) is less obvious. The early-flowering 'Atkinsii', which is tall, with long, teardrop-shaped flowers, never sets seed but is immensely prolific, so that you can build up stock at great speed. Of course, it is easy to understand how people get hooked. You see a different one that appeals to you and, naturally, want it. But that is different from being bitten by the snowdrop bug and avidly collecting. I might have 20 identifiable kinds, but a genuine nutter might have upwards of 300 and still be far from sated. The collecting instinct is so natural to many of us (better snowdrops than stamps, I should say) that it would be pointless to be sniffy about it, but galanthophiles can easily become galanthobores. There is a kind of vanity involved. If you can make yourself an expert in your subject, however narrow it may be, you have a vantage point. And if it really means so much to you, chances are that you are, overall, a bit of a bore. None of which should in any way tarnish the delights provided by snowdrops. They do command pretty colossal prices - \u00a320 for one bulb seems quite a lot to pay. Two enthusiasts, interviewed for an article in the Royal Horticultural Society journal, The Garden, are reported to have said that neither of them \"uses any commercial methods of propagation to increase their snowdrop stock. They prefer to rely on nature.\" That, surely, is sheer snobbery, suggesting that there is, by definition, something a bit underhand about commerce and that its methods are of necessity not nice. Had these same enthusiasts been trained to be handy with a knife and to practise the basically quite simple techniques for increasing stock more quickly than Dame Nature manages, they would be singing a different tune. The practice of scooping out a bulb's base-plate and then giving it warm, moist conditions, so that it fairly quickly starts to make little bulbils around the rim of the cut, is very old (particularly on hyacinths) and the more rapid increase of valuable stock that it enables is of great benefit to us all. Ignorance has a lot to answer for. It is often inevitable, but nothing to take pride in. Another point to make about the spate of newly-named snowdrops is that, while they may be curious, they are often downright ugly - far from an improvement. Nothing will turn me off growing snowdrops. I want more and more of them, and am constantly cudgelling my brains to think of new places where they will be both happy and appropriate. If we want to divide or move them around, there is no better moment than immediately after they have flowered Drop goals For success with snowdrops \u0095 Get hold of good-quality bulbs: freshly dug ones are always the best, as dry bulbs will take much longer to flower. \u0095 Plant 7.5cm deep in dappled shade during September/October. \u0095 Snowdrop bulbs are at their happiest in a clay/humus-rich soil that will be damp in winter and spring and dry during the summer. Top dress them lightly with compost or leaf mould. \u0095 For reliability, choose from the more vigorous varieties, such as Galanthus 'S. Arnott', 'Atkinsii' and 'Magnet'. \u0095 If growing snowdrops indoors, keep them on a cool, north-facing windowsill. Heat causes bulbs to go blind (ie, fail to develop flower buds). \u0095 Plant pots from indoors outside, and divide clumps outdoors after flowering. What to avoid \u0095 Infestation of narcissus flies - their grubs eat developing flower buds. \u0095 Holes left by dying leaves - rake the soil lightly to fill them in. Also, you could try dusting the soil with pirimphos-methyl before planting. \u0095 Very acid, rich or free-draining soil, or thick grassland. \u0095 Bulbs that show any leaf distortion or grey mould. \u0095 Don't dig up bulbs from the wild: snowdrops, like other native flora, have suffered greatly as a result of such thieving. \u0095 Research by Patrick Driscall",

      "body": "<p>Her Majesty's new minister for energy and competitiveness in Europe sits in his eighth-floor eyrie looking down on Parliament Square. To the right is Westminster Abbey, behind it the House of Commons. To the left lie the distant rooftops of his beloved Foreign Office. It's a grey, blustery London day with the wind running up the river Thames just beyond the Commons. </p> <p>If Peter Mandelson had not fallen, then the new minister for energy would have been somewhere else on this Monday morning. He would have been in Nigeria, and then Ghana, on a Foreign Office trip. And there were other plans, too: speeches to the UN security council on Iraqi sanctions and, inevitably, slots on Radio 4's Today programme on the assassination of an African leader, or the worsening crisis in the Middle East. Instead, the new in-tray is filling up with briefs on miners' compensation, working party reports on vibration white-finger, the incidence of emphysema in Welsh villages and the distribution patterns of ultra-low sulphur petrol across the United Kingdom. </p> <p>Scandals and resignations aside, the next British election is two to four months away. Is this, then, the pinnacle of the political career of Peter Hain, \"son of Africa\", activist, political firebrand of the 60s and, according to what remains of the British left, a \"sell-out\" and a \"war criminal\"? </p> <p>Depending on who you talk to, Hain's shiftto this new post is: a) demotion because of his big mouth, over-aggressive tactics and Robin Cook's annoyance at being overshadowed by his junior minister; b) promotion because miners' compensation is tricky for New Labour and Tony Blair wants a good media performer in the job; c) a sideways shift that will secure Hain sufficient domestic ministerial experience to enter the cabinet after the next election; or d) the penultimate move in a short but contentious ministerial career. Hain, who like his suntan radiates aggressive optimism, adheres to option b), with elements of c) attached: \"I got the call at 8.45pm to 'Ring Downing Street'. Tony said, 'I think you've done a great job at the Foreign Office. I want you back in domestic politics. I want my best people there.' I don't think it's exile.\" </p> <p>But his shift sideways is still puzzling. Uniquely, Hain was one of only a few Foreign Office ministers in living memory actually to know anything about and be actively involved in the subject of his portfolio - in this case, Africa - before his appointment. \"He was an excellent thing in the Foreign Office,\" said a senior FO official. \"He was very popular in Africa with lots of African leaders. Peter was always prepared to talk tough, talk straight. He will be sorely missed.\" </p> <p>But nothing is as it seems at Westminster. \"Peter has tried to spin this 10 different ways,\" said one party colleague. \"Star Wars, the American Nuclear Missile Defence [NMD] shield, has done him in. Robin Cook does not like him. He upset the mandarins. He is getting promoted before going on to great things: that one is the hollowest lie of all. If he is being promoted, how come he is being sent to the backwater of energy? His star has waned. Nothing is forever in politics, but you've got to ask yourself what was it all for. He prostituted himself for Blair's foreign policy on Iraq, and Blair's 'foreign policy' in Wales. And for what - energy?\" </p> <p>Politics can be a cruel and wounding business, but the depth of enmity towards Hain, half in and half out with Blair, and still a relatively junior minister, is ferocious. In a recent New Statesman article, the journalist John Pilger compared Peter Hain to the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and accused the \"murderous policy-maker\" of being responsible for the 500,000 civilian deaths that the UN estimates have been caused by the continuing sanctions regime. \"He is doing exactly the opposite thing from what he was doing in the 70s when he organised the stop-the-cricket tour,\" says Pilger. \"I know him. I made a film with him in the 70s when he was wrongly arrested for a bank robbery in Putney. I took up his case. This is a guy who understood what the Americans did in Vietnam. And now he has become part of the straight line of US policy. He is an apologist for sanctions and bombing. He has become the fall guy.\" </p> <p>In retort, Hain does little to mask his own disdain. \"I think, in the old days, Pilger was a good investigative journalist - regrettably, I don't know many people who take him seriously. To compare me to Saddam Hussein is, frankly, beneath contempt.\" His voice breaks into laughter. \"On this issue of sanctions, the left is divided. But the critics end up virtually apologising for Saddam. I have always been an opponent of tyranny. What the critics don't like is that I take the debate to them.\" </p> <p>Most MPs struggle against their identikit peers to be selected for their seats and then they struggle in parliament to get promoted, to get noticed, to get ahead. In contrast, Hain has been a political celebrity, whose role as a leading Young Liberal in stopping the 1970 South African cricket tour by threatening direct-action mayhem is burned on the political memories of the over-40s. Hain's tactics were so effective that Labour prime minister Harold Wilson believed further protests would destabilise his government, and so forced the cricket authorities to cancel the tour. It was a significant blow to the apartheid state and the beginning of the worldwide sporting isolation of South Africa. Even today, virtually everywhere Hain goes he is approached by European foreign ministers, photographers, ageing activists and old rugby fans, all eager to share a moment with the first political star they ever saw. </p> <p>His political path is the antithesis of the New Labourite. Twice, he has ended up on trial at the Old Bailey: once, in 1972, on trumped-up conspiracy charges, and the second four years later on equally dubious but serious bank robbery charges. And twice, after determined legal struggles, he was found not guilty. Being prosecuted at such a level is a devastating event even for an innocent man. \"I slept worse than I have ever done, often waking in the night, 'in the witness box', and usually waking early in the morning with the whole incredible affair in my mind,\" Hain recorded in his book, A Putney Plot? </p> <p>After he recovered from the ordeal of the trials, Hain helped found the successful Anti-Nazi League (ANL), which in 1976 chased the then-resurgent National Front off the streets and denied fascism a publicly respectable front in British politics. Again, it was one of the most effective direct-action campaigns in postwar British history. Most of the organising power for the ANL came from the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party (SWP). Hain is unapologetic about his involvement: \"I was press officer and steering committee member, and pulled in a lot of people who would not have touched the SWP with a bargepole. They were very impressive in their ability to generate leaflets and organise things almost overnight. They will certainly regard me as a betrayal merchant now.\" </p> <p>Conventional political respectability came later, a lot later. It was another 15 years before he was selected for the safe Labour seat of Neath in 1991. \"I never imagined I would become an MP,\" he admits. In fact, I was pretty sceptical of MPs for a long time. I had always seen myself as an extra-parliamentary activist. Politics has become a career where people work to become an MP from when they leave university and then, if they are members of the ruling party, work to become an government ministers. The weakness of the newer generation of MPs and ministers, not all of them, is that they do not have those political and ideological roots.\" </p> <p> As a political activist, then, Hain's credentials are impeccable. He is the kind of politician we all think we like. He gets on well with his officials and with journalists. He is open, refreshingly candid and sort of honest. And he speaks his mind. He has called the French policy on Iraq \"pretty contemptible\", and denounced South African policy on Zimbabwe, while labelling the Zimbabwean government itself as \"uncivilised\". He is not meanly sectarian; he doesn't defend everything in the New Labour bible. </p> <p>Hain's entry on to the political stage could hardly have been more tragic or auspicious. Hain was born in Nairobi in 1950, and he grew up in Pretoria, in the heart of apartheid South Africa. His parents, Walter and Adelaine, were members of the non-racial but largely white Liberal party. After the 1960 Sharpeville massacre, the Afrikaner regime systematically crushed all political opposition. The Hains, who had effectively become the Liberal party's main organisers in the very citadel of apartheid, automatically came under suspicion: the family home was raided by the security police, their mail intercepted, their phone tapped, and both parents detained before eventually being \"banned\" - which made it a criminal offence for them to speak to more than one person at a time or even to enter a public building. Walter Hain was hounded out of his job as an architect and all future prospective employers were warned off. </p> <p>In opposing apartheid, the Hains represented a tiny, but honourable, minority within the English-speaking white community. Most white \"liberals\" were anything but - one horrified aunt placed an advert in the local Pretoria News disavowing any connection with the Mrs Hain of the Liberal party, who just happened to be her sister-in-law. But the ideological origins of the family in \"liberalism\" and not \"communism\" - most white activists at the time were associated with the South African Communist party and the ANC - would have significant bearing on young Peter's later political development. </p> <p>The Hains had always opposed the use of violence - which was taken up by the ANC in the early 60s - but members of their political circle joined a small white terrorist group, the Armed Resistance Movement (ARM), that planted bombs. ARM was an amateurish affair, but one bomb exploded at Johannesburg station in July 1964 and killed two passers-by. A family friend, John Harris, 25, was arrested, tortured and confessed to the crime. Harris's wife, Ann, and their young son, David, went to live with the Hains in the run-up to the trial. All pleas for clemency were rejected, and Harris was sentenced to death and hanged at dawn on April 1, 1965. Because his parents were banned from speaking in public, Peter, then 15 and dressed in his school uniform, was conscripted to read Harris's funeral oration that morning. It was his first political speech. Within the hour, he was back at school. </p> <p>A year later, the family were forced to flee by the apartheid security police. They left for England. The powers of darkness, as Hain wrote in his account of that time, Sing The Beloved Country, were in the ascendancy. Nelson Mandela was in prison, along with the rest of the ANC leadership, and resistance had been all but destroyed. \"The apartheid state seemed immortal. We were going for good.\" The Hains were in exile. They settled in Putney, southwest London, at the time a rather tatty suburb along the Thames. \"My father was quite clear: 'What we must do is become members of the community.' There was among South African exiles - true of all exiles - a kind of limbo existence. People were constantly waiting to go back and never settling. One of my best friends, my age, committed suicide a year after coming across. He was very able, a brilliant cricketer, brilliant academically. We [the Hain family] sunk ourselves into domestic politics. We were never going back. I joined the Young Liberals. I stayed in Putney politics until 1991.\" </p> <p>In late 1968, the South African government had refused to allow Basil D'Oliveria, a black cricketer, to tour with the English team in South Africa because of his race. The tour was cancelled. Despite the row, the MCC announced that the 1970 tour of England by the South African cricket team would still go ahead. Hain, by now a student of mechanical engineering at Imperial College, London, formed a pressure group, Stop The Seventy Tour (STST), and announced that he and a few others were going to force the tour's cancellation. </p> <p>Their first move was to disrupt the 1968 Springbok rugby tour. Until then, the division between sport and politics in Britain was sacrosanct and largely unquestioned, but the live TV coverage of protesters messing up the Afrikaners' beloved game of rugby provoked fury in South Africa, and generated immense publicity in Britain. Attempts by the organisers to thwart the demonstrators by switching venues at the last minute only led to further headlines and a deepening crisis. \"Direct action\" took hold as copycat protests followed the Springbok rugby team around the country - Gordon Brown signed on as Hain's Edinburgh organiser - and a secret inner STST group of activists was formed. They chained themselves to the Springbok team's coach, glued the locks on the players' hotel rooms and threw vivid orange smoke-bombs on to the pitch for the benefit of TV cameras. The final score was STST one, Springboks nil. Next summer, home secretary James Callaghan called the MCC to Downing Street; the 1970 cricket tour was called off. </p> <p>It was a stunning victory for the broader anti-apartheid movement, and for Hain personally. But the campaign was not without its personal psychological costs to other members of the Hain family. Peter is the eldest of four children. Like his parents, his three siblings, Tom, Jo-Anne and Sally, were caught up in the whirlwind of political activity surrounding the STST. Private family space all but disappeared. \"You spend so long thinking about other people's problems that you don't realise that you're not doing enough to sort out your own problems,\" says Sally Hain, who now works for her brother in his Neath constituency. \"We are all scarred by that period. It took ages to get over it.\" </p> <p>The hippies who ran on to the pitch as part of the STST campaign also gave a misleading impression of the personal lifestyle of the movement's chief organiser. It may have been the era of free love, rock'n'roll and Lebanese Red, but underneath the long sideburns Hain was a moral puritan. \"In my personal life, I have never actually smoked dope - it's a terrible admission,\" says Hain. \"I did not like the idea. I had a fairly traditional South African upbringing. I just was not interested. I found it rather distasteful. I remember one Young Liberal conference, a whole group of people were smoking dope and one came up to me and literally tried to force the cigarette into my mouth: 'Come on, Peter, try it.' I have never had a problem with people smoking pot - I just don't want to do it. I have never had a problem with people getting drunk, I just have never been drunk myself. I'm not saying I've never had too much to drink, but I've never been drunk and out of control. There is something in my constitution. At a party, even if I'm not driving home, it comes to a certain point and I stop enjoying it. I switch to water. It's very boring, I know. I did not wear flares until they had gone out of fashion.\" </p> <p>It is an interesting admission. The most dangerous radicals are always personal conservatives; every waking, hangover-free hour is devoted to the cause. Far from being a dropout, Hain was an assiduous student and family man who married young, paid his electricity bills on time, saved for the future, and conscientiously sought the destruction of the apartheid state. His marriage, which produced two sons, lasted for 24 years and ended only last year. </p> <p>Hain is hyperactive, a morning person who is probably happiest ringing his way through a 30-person-long phone task list at 8.30am. He is the author of 13 books, including the inevitable \"political thriller\", The Peking Connection. The books are not great, but the sheer volume of them is quite an achievement. Book-writing, particularly political tomes, is a tiresome, laborious business with next to nil financial reward. One of his last acts as Foreign Office minister was to write a 60-page pamphlet, The End Of Foreign Policy, about globalisation. Again, none of the ideas is strikingly original, but since most government ministers already work 80 hours a week, squeezing a few more hours out to produce a political tract is the mark both of a highly disciplined and highly ambitious mind. Peter Hain likes to make his mark. </p> <p>He joined the Labour party in 1977, and worked first as a political researcher for the Communications Workers' Union and then, in the 80s, twice stood as the Labour party candidate in Putney, which, since he first arrived there, has turned into a rising middle-class enclave where ordinary three-bedroomed terrace houses cost \u00a3500,000. The powers of darkness, depending on your political view, were once more in the ascendancy, and Hain was soundly beaten in both the 1983 and 1987 general elections by David Mellor, despite energetic electoral campaigns. </p> <p> In 1991, the Neath constituency, near Swansea, became vacant. Hain was a metropolitan shoo-in. It was a fix, but not a bad fix. Neath is partially Welsh-speaking, and it rains a lot on the roofs of the old car part factories that are now, like their former workers, redundant. Hain, with his slight South African accent, his smooth couture, his bright suntan and silver locks, is an exotic foreigner, almost an alien species. But he is a determined constituency MP who holds 42 surgeries a year. There is a full-time agent, an office and three secretaries. His majority is 17,000. Peter Hain is not going to lose Neath. </p> <p>But just being an MP was never enough for Hain, who has a cold but realistic view of the average MP's life in the mother of all parliaments. \"It's almost a system for institutionalising failed ambitions. There is enormous scepticism, jealousy and envy bred. It's true whoever you are. You get elected feeling you can change the world, and what you find yourself in is a very competitive, individualised activity where you are in competition for jobs, to ask questions, to do anything. And you find out you only get it if someone else doesn't. I did not have any illusions. I saw people being swallowed up by the system.\" </p> <p>Hain's original route into the Labour party was via the left-wing Tribune group of MPs; eventually, he became chair of the Tribune newspaper board. His politics were typical of the time: redistribution of wealth, membership of CND, anti-European Union, pro-trades union, anti-multinationals. One unusual item in his political CV has been his support for the Falklands war. \"I supported the invasion. After what happened, I could not see how you could do anything else. You could not have Galtieri and the tyranny he represented just coming over. There did not seem to me to be any proper anti-colonial claim that justified his fascistic government ruling over the Falkland islanders.\" Hain is no pacifist, but he still retains his membership of CND - a real New Labour no-no, which is why he is careful to explain that he was never more than a rank-and-file member. It's pretty clear that he no longer believes in unilateralism, but his continued CND membership has provided the Tories, not to mention his rivals in government, with convenient ammunition for sniping and parliamentary knockabout. William Hague raised the issue at prime minister'squestions. The row has followed him into his new department, where his brief covers the nuclear industry. Hain's retort to his Tory critics is pithy: \"I still pay my \u00a39 a year to Wales CND. I happen not to agree with CND's line on the Nuclear Missile Defence [NMD], but I am not going to turn my back on people in Wales who are doing some good peace work because of some Tory critics. To hell with them, frankly.\" </p> <p>More important, his CND membership was at the centre of a professionally damaging leak and subsequent row over the American NMD programme last December that, according to the option a) theory of Hain's over-aggressive tactics, explains his removal from the sensitive Foreign Office portfolio. According to this theory, Hain had blundered into the radioactive political zone of Anglo-American nuclear relations by leaking a memo stating his opposition to NMD in order to curry favour with his old CND mates. </p> <p>First a bit of background. It's no real secret that Robin Cook, Tony Blair, the British government, the Europeans, the Russians and the Chinese are decidedly luke-warm about the updated version of the American Star Wars programme. But, as the US's most compliant \"ally\", no one in the British government has the courage openly to tell the Americans that NMD is a foolish idea that could provoke another arms race. The government's policy has been to talk and talk about NMD to the Americans, hope the missile tests all fail, and shut up in public. </p> <p>Enter the leaked memo, or at least a report of one, between Hain and Cook, where Hain expressed outright opposition to the US missile initiative. In private, the memo was fine, but public knowledge of its existence was a crime. NMD, CND . . . was Hain playing to his old leftie mates on the terraces for personal advancement? That, at least, was the first thought of Cook and his advisers. An immediate leak enquiry was instigated to unmask the traitor. Hain's team, in turn, thought one of Cook's team had done the deed to smear their rising star. Hain is adamant that the leak had nothing to do with him. \"Someone in the Foreign Office did it to damage me. I do not think it has anything to do with my switch to a very important job in the Department of Trade and Industry.\" </p> <p>Hain's last book, Ayes To The Left, A Future For Socialism, published in 1996, contains much talk of economic inequalities, freedom of information bills and making sure the intelligence services are democratically accountable. It's so far away from the New Labour norm that it reads like the manifesto of an entirely different political party from the one that Hain represents in government. In his time at the Foreign Office, Hain regularly had MI6 reports across his desk and is proud of the fact that he used that intelligence to name in Parliament Angolan sanction busters such as Victor Bout, who trade arms for diamonds. </p> <p>In a move that every activist dreams of, he even got to discuss his own extensive file with the head of MI5. But nothing changes, does it? To his credit, when I asked him about all those Labour plans for democratic accountability for the intelligence services, he had the grace not to pretend for more than a few seconds that it was any different today than it was 30 years ago, when he himself was under MI5 surveillance. </p> <p>Initially, he resisted the rise of the New Labour Project, and used the Tribune Group as a platform to challenge Blair's policy revolution. In a counter-attack, Blair and Brown turned up at a Tribune Group election to vote him off the organising committee, install their own placemen and collapse the parliamentary Tribune grouping from within. His card in New Labour terms was marked: \"If you are not a true believer in what New Labour is supposed to be about, you will never be trusted,\" says Mark Seddon, a former Labour NEC member and current editor of Tribune. \"To be trusted by New Labour, you have to recant your past. Peter Hain is rather too intelligent and more dangerous to do that.\" </p> <p>After his successful 1997 election campaign in Neath, Hain was appointed junior minister in the Welsh Office under Ron Davies - who famously went for a walk on Clapham Common and was forced to resign the next morning amid a frenzy of revelations of homosexual encounters and stolen cars. Davies's spectacular fall blew the Welsh Labour party apart and reopened the leadership battle for the Welsh Assembly. In a move fiercely opposed by the vast majority of the Welsh Labour party, which favoured the popular Rhodri Morgan, Tony Blair appointed Alun Michael as the new national secretary of state for Wales and then sought to have Michael elected as first minister to the forthcoming assembly. Hain was Michael's \"corner man\" in the battle for leadership in an election that mirrored the Labour London mayoral candidate debacle. It was a bruising, pointless, internecine struggle that raged through the spring of 1999. \"If Alun Michael was parachuted in, then Peter was the guy flying the plane,\" says Welsh Labour MP, Paul Flynn. \"He ran the campaign, he moved to the left, then to the right and then back again. He briefed against Rhodri.\" After lots and lots of New Labour fixing, Michael was eventually elected - only to lose a no-confidence vote and resign a year later. Morgan was duly elected leader in February 2000, and Blair's \"foreign policy\" in Wales fell apart. </p> <p>The Alun Michael debacle was not Hain's finest hour, and his reputation in Wales was badly tarnished. \"It was one of the least comfortable, least enjoyable, campaigns I have been involved in. And lessons have been learned, as Tony Blair himself conceded,\" he says rather uncomfortably. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Hain had clearly proved himself as a Blairista of sorts, and in the summer of 1999 he was brought into the Foreign Office by Robin Cook. Hain was at first regarded a great success and genuinely innovative. But within months he was involved in a whole series of diplomatic shouting matches. The first to blow up was Zimbabwe. Mugabe and Hain initially met in London in October 1999. Famously, Mugabe patted Hain on the knee and told him he was a \"son of Africa\". Things turned sour two days later, when Peter Tatchell, the gay-rights campaigner, sought to make a citizen's arrest of the African leader at his London hotel for his persecution of homosexuals in Zimbabwe. Overnight, diplomatic relations plunged as Mugabe denounced the Blair government as \"gay gangsters\". </p> <p>As Hain and the Foreign Office quickly came to realise, shared past histories of struggle don't count for much. \"Mugabe was violently assaulting the opposition and manipulating the land issue, which he had neglected for 10 years, to get re-elected - he was not going to listen to me or anybody else,\" says Hain, who stridently, and undiplomatically, made a point of denouncing the Mugabe regime and was criticised in particular, as a white South African, for using the term \"uncivilised\". But his sweetest triumph came last Christmas when Hain took an extended family holiday with his new partner, Elizabeth Howard, and his parents back to South Africa. He spent New Year in the holiest of shrines to the apartheid struggle, in the governor's quarters of Robben Island, the prison-turned-museum where Mandela spent 27 years. \"I never imagined being a minister, let alone being minister for Africa. Going back to South Africa seemed miraculous.\" </p> <p>Hain has been attacked most vehemently over his outspoken support for a string of military interventions, including Sierra Leone. His biggest battle was over Iraq, where he came under sustained assault from many of those he would have regarded as friends. For a decade, the US and Britain have unilaterally imposed no-fly zones on the Iraqi regime - regularly enforced with bombing raids. And, despite growing opposition from within the UN security council, they have maintained crippling economic blockades over Saddam Hussein's weapons programme and the continued exclusion of UN arms inspectors. Critics argue that the sanctions have done nothing to remove Saddam from power, and have rather inflicted needless suffering on the civilian Iraqi population. \"I am totally against sanctions,\" says Tony Benn. \"We have killed half a million Iraqis. Blaming that on Saddam is like blaming Churchill for the blitz. I suppose he could have stopped the blitz by surrendering to the Nazis. It's a crime against humanity.\" </p> <p>Hain's defence is typically robust: \"Firstly, I was responsible for the policy on Iraq. Secondly, I believe it. I don't think it's a perfect policy - far from it - but then you are dealing with an imperfect world, a horribly intractable position. I would not have started from here. I would have gone all the way to Baghdad and taken Saddam out. The strongest point in the critics' case is the suffering there has been. The weakest is what do you do about it. Their position amounts to a ferocious assault on sanctions to the point where they ignore and deny - which is extraordinary - that he has biological and chemical weapons. And that he has a research and defence capability that, within six or seven years, will probably give him a nuclear weapon. I do not accept that you can lay a charge of betrayal against me for supporting a policy that tries to contain Saddam's threat to the region.\" </p> <p>Because of his aggressive stance defending the bombing and sanctions policy on Iraq, Hain has shifted shape, in the eyes of his enemies, from hero to arch betrayer. He vehemently denies he has sold out. \"I come from the left, I am proudly on the left. There is an endemic culture of betrayal on the left: waiting for the next leader or spokesperson to sell you out. </p> <p>\"Being in government and trying to move things forward is stressful. Those who try to put pressure on government are always one-sided. But so, too, is the established position and the interests it represents. I am not saying I am no longer an activist, but you assume different roles. I still respect extra-parliamentary activists. I might not agree with them. They can regard me as a sell-out. That is their problem.\" </p> <p>Most politicians are nobodies. They come and they go. They rule for a brief hour and they fall and disappear. Hain is another kind of creature. He has been famous for 35 years, ever since John Harris's funeral oration in apartheid South Africa: his schoolboy picture was in the papers the next day. He likes it. He has never had an another existence; he grew up writing press releases, giving interviews, taking command, organising campaigns. He is evidently good at it. He desperately wants to keep doing it. Does he have a future in Blair's next government? Is he on option c), on the path to greater things, or option d), on the way out. No one knows, apart from the true Blairistas in the Downing Street bunker. But there is something about Hain - all that energy and activity - that probably makes him more dangerous to New Labour on the outside than in the fold. Come the summer, I wouldn't be surprised to see him walking down Downing Street on Thursday mornings for that cabinet meeting</p>",

      "bodyText": "Her Majesty's new minister for energy and competitiveness in Europe sits in his eighth-floor eyrie looking down on Parliament Square. To the right is Westminster Abbey, behind it the House of Commons. To the left lie the distant rooftops of his beloved Foreign Office. It's a grey, blustery London day with the wind running up the river Thames just beyond the Commons. If Peter Mandelson had not fallen, then the new minister for energy would have been somewhere else on this Monday morning. He would have been in Nigeria, and then Ghana, on a Foreign Office trip. And there were other plans, too: speeches to the UN security council on Iraqi sanctions and, inevitably, slots on Radio 4's Today programme on the assassination of an African leader, or the worsening crisis in the Middle East. Instead, the new in-tray is filling up with briefs on miners' compensation, working party reports on vibration white-finger, the incidence of emphysema in Welsh villages and the distribution patterns of ultra-low sulphur petrol across the United Kingdom. Scandals and resignations aside, the next British election is two to four months away. Is this, then, the pinnacle of the political career of Peter Hain, \"son of Africa\", activist, political firebrand of the 60s and, according to what remains of the British left, a \"sell-out\" and a \"war criminal\"? Depending on who you talk to, Hain's shiftto this new post is: a) demotion because of his big mouth, over-aggressive tactics and Robin Cook's annoyance at being overshadowed by his junior minister; b) promotion because miners' compensation is tricky for New Labour and Tony Blair wants a good media performer in the job; c) a sideways shift that will secure Hain sufficient domestic ministerial experience to enter the cabinet after the next election; or d) the penultimate move in a short but contentious ministerial career. Hain, who like his suntan radiates aggressive optimism, adheres to option b), with elements of c) attached: \"I got the call at 8.45pm to 'Ring Downing Street'. Tony said, 'I think you've done a great job at the Foreign Office. I want you back in domestic politics. I want my best people there.' I don't think it's exile.\" But his shift sideways is still puzzling. Uniquely, Hain was one of only a few Foreign Office ministers in living memory actually to know anything about and be actively involved in the subject of his portfolio - in this case, Africa - before his appointment. \"He was an excellent thing in the Foreign Office,\" said a senior FO official. \"He was very popular in Africa with lots of African leaders. Peter was always prepared to talk tough, talk straight. He will be sorely missed.\" But nothing is as it seems at Westminster. \"Peter has tried to spin this 10 different ways,\" said one party colleague. \"Star Wars, the American Nuclear Missile Defence [NMD] shield, has done him in. Robin Cook does not like him. He upset the mandarins. He is getting promoted before going on to great things: that one is the hollowest lie of all. If he is being promoted, how come he is being sent to the backwater of energy? His star has waned. Nothing is forever in politics, but you've got to ask yourself what was it all for. He prostituted himself for Blair's foreign policy on Iraq, and Blair's 'foreign policy' in Wales. And for what - energy?\" Politics can be a cruel and wounding business, but the depth of enmity towards Hain, half in and half out with Blair, and still a relatively junior minister, is ferocious. In a recent New Statesman article, the journalist John Pilger compared Peter Hain to the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and accused the \"murderous policy-maker\" of being responsible for the 500,000 civilian deaths that the UN estimates have been caused by the continuing sanctions regime. \"He is doing exactly the opposite thing from what he was doing in the 70s when he organised the stop-the-cricket tour,\" says Pilger. \"I know him. I made a film with him in the 70s when he was wrongly arrested for a bank robbery in Putney. I took up his case. This is a guy who understood what the Americans did in Vietnam. And now he has become part of the straight line of US policy. He is an apologist for sanctions and bombing. He has become the fall guy.\" In retort, Hain does little to mask his own disdain. \"I think, in the old days, Pilger was a good investigative journalist - regrettably, I don't know many people who take him seriously. To compare me to Saddam Hussein is, frankly, beneath contempt.\" His voice breaks into laughter. \"On this issue of sanctions, the left is divided. But the critics end up virtually apologising for Saddam. I have always been an opponent of tyranny. What the critics don't like is that I take the debate to them.\" Most MPs struggle against their identikit peers to be selected for their seats and then they struggle in parliament to get promoted, to get noticed, to get ahead. In contrast, Hain has been a political celebrity, whose role as a leading Young Liberal in stopping the 1970 South African cricket tour by threatening direct-action mayhem is burned on the political memories of the over-40s. Hain's tactics were so effective that Labour prime minister Harold Wilson believed further protests would destabilise his government, and so forced the cricket authorities to cancel the tour. It was a significant blow to the apartheid state and the beginning of the worldwide sporting isolation of South Africa. Even today, virtually everywhere Hain goes he is approached by European foreign ministers, photographers, ageing activists and old rugby fans, all eager to share a moment with the first political star they ever saw. His political path is the antithesis of the New Labourite. Twice, he has ended up on trial at the Old Bailey: once, in 1972, on trumped-up conspiracy charges, and the second four years later on equally dubious but serious bank robbery charges. And twice, after determined legal struggles, he was found not guilty. Being prosecuted at such a level is a devastating event even for an innocent man. \"I slept worse than I have ever done, often waking in the night, 'in the witness box', and usually waking early in the morning with the whole incredible affair in my mind,\" Hain recorded in his book, A Putney Plot? After he recovered from the ordeal of the trials, Hain helped found the successful Anti-Nazi League (ANL), which in 1976 chased the then-resurgent National Front off the streets and denied fascism a publicly respectable front in British politics. Again, it was one of the most effective direct-action campaigns in postwar British history. Most of the organising power for the ANL came from the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party (SWP). Hain is unapologetic about his involvement: \"I was press officer and steering committee member, and pulled in a lot of people who would not have touched the SWP with a bargepole. They were very impressive in their ability to generate leaflets and organise things almost overnight. They will certainly regard me as a betrayal merchant now.\" Conventional political respectability came later, a lot later. It was another 15 years before he was selected for the safe Labour seat of Neath in 1991. \"I never imagined I would become an MP,\" he admits. In fact, I was pretty sceptical of MPs for a long time. I had always seen myself as an extra-parliamentary activist. Politics has become a career where people work to become an MP from when they leave university and then, if they are members of the ruling party, work to become an government ministers. The weakness of the newer generation of MPs and ministers, not all of them, is that they do not have those political and ideological roots.\" As a political activist, then, Hain's credentials are impeccable. He is the kind of politician we all think we like. He gets on well with his officials and with journalists. He is open, refreshingly candid and sort of honest. And he speaks his mind. He has called the French policy on Iraq \"pretty contemptible\", and denounced South African policy on Zimbabwe, while labelling the Zimbabwean government itself as \"uncivilised\". He is not meanly sectarian; he doesn't defend everything in the New Labour bible. Hain's entry on to the political stage could hardly have been more tragic or auspicious. Hain was born in Nairobi in 1950, and he grew up in Pretoria, in the heart of apartheid South Africa. His parents, Walter and Adelaine, were members of the non-racial but largely white Liberal party. After the 1960 Sharpeville massacre, the Afrikaner regime systematically crushed all political opposition. The Hains, who had effectively become the Liberal party's main organisers in the very citadel of apartheid, automatically came under suspicion: the family home was raided by the security police, their mail intercepted, their phone tapped, and both parents detained before eventually being \"banned\" - which made it a criminal offence for them to speak to more than one person at a time or even to enter a public building. Walter Hain was hounded out of his job as an architect and all future prospective employers were warned off. In opposing apartheid, the Hains represented a tiny, but honourable, minority within the English-speaking white community. Most white \"liberals\" were anything but - one horrified aunt placed an advert in the local Pretoria News disavowing any connection with the Mrs Hain of the Liberal party, who just happened to be her sister-in-law. But the ideological origins of the family in \"liberalism\" and not \"communism\" - most white activists at the time were associated with the South African Communist party and the ANC - would have significant bearing on young Peter's later political development. The Hains had always opposed the use of violence - which was taken up by the ANC in the early 60s - but members of their political circle joined a small white terrorist group, the Armed Resistance Movement (ARM), that planted bombs. ARM was an amateurish affair, but one bomb exploded at Johannesburg station in July 1964 and killed two passers-by. A family friend, John Harris, 25, was arrested, tortured and confessed to the crime. Harris's wife, Ann, and their young son, David, went to live with the Hains in the run-up to the trial. All pleas for clemency were rejected, and Harris was sentenced to death and hanged at dawn on April 1, 1965. Because his parents were banned from speaking in public, Peter, then 15 and dressed in his school uniform, was conscripted to read Harris's funeral oration that morning. It was his first political speech. Within the hour, he was back at school. A year later, the family were forced to flee by the apartheid security police. They left for England. The powers of darkness, as Hain wrote in his account of that time, Sing The Beloved Country, were in the ascendancy. Nelson Mandela was in prison, along with the rest of the ANC leadership, and resistance had been all but destroyed. \"The apartheid state seemed immortal. We were going for good.\" The Hains were in exile. They settled in Putney, southwest London, at the time a rather tatty suburb along the Thames. \"My father was quite clear: 'What we must do is become members of the community.' There was among South African exiles - true of all exiles - a kind of limbo existence. People were constantly waiting to go back and never settling. One of my best friends, my age, committed suicide a year after coming across. He was very able, a brilliant cricketer, brilliant academically. We [the Hain family] sunk ourselves into domestic politics. We were never going back. I joined the Young Liberals. I stayed in Putney politics until 1991.\" In late 1968, the South African government had refused to allow Basil D'Oliveria, a black cricketer, to tour with the English team in South Africa because of his race. The tour was cancelled. Despite the row, the MCC announced that the 1970 tour of England by the South African cricket team would still go ahead. Hain, by now a student of mechanical engineering at Imperial College, London, formed a pressure group, Stop The Seventy Tour (STST), and announced that he and a few others were going to force the tour's cancellation. Their first move was to disrupt the 1968 Springbok rugby tour. Until then, the division between sport and politics in Britain was sacrosanct and largely unquestioned, but the live TV coverage of protesters messing up the Afrikaners' beloved game of rugby provoked fury in South Africa, and generated immense publicity in Britain. Attempts by the organisers to thwart the demonstrators by switching venues at the last minute only led to further headlines and a deepening crisis. \"Direct action\" took hold as copycat protests followed the Springbok rugby team around the country - Gordon Brown signed on as Hain's Edinburgh organiser - and a secret inner STST group of activists was formed. They chained themselves to the Springbok team's coach, glued the locks on the players' hotel rooms and threw vivid orange smoke-bombs on to the pitch for the benefit of TV cameras. The final score was STST one, Springboks nil. Next summer, home secretary James Callaghan called the MCC to Downing Street; the 1970 cricket tour was called off. It was a stunning victory for the broader anti-apartheid movement, and for Hain personally. But the campaign was not without its personal psychological costs to other members of the Hain family. Peter is the eldest of four children. Like his parents, his three siblings, Tom, Jo-Anne and Sally, were caught up in the whirlwind of political activity surrounding the STST. Private family space all but disappeared. \"You spend so long thinking about other people's problems that you don't realise that you're not doing enough to sort out your own problems,\" says Sally Hain, who now works for her brother in his Neath constituency. \"We are all scarred by that period. It took ages to get over it.\" The hippies who ran on to the pitch as part of the STST campaign also gave a misleading impression of the personal lifestyle of the movement's chief organiser. It may have been the era of free love, rock'n'roll and Lebanese Red, but underneath the long sideburns Hain was a moral puritan. \"In my personal life, I have never actually smoked dope - it's a terrible admission,\" says Hain. \"I did not like the idea. I had a fairly traditional South African upbringing. I just was not interested. I found it rather distasteful. I remember one Young Liberal conference, a whole group of people were smoking dope and one came up to me and literally tried to force the cigarette into my mouth: 'Come on, Peter, try it.' I have never had a problem with people smoking pot - I just don't want to do it. I have never had a problem with people getting drunk, I just have never been drunk myself. I'm not saying I've never had too much to drink, but I've never been drunk and out of control. There is something in my constitution. At a party, even if I'm not driving home, it comes to a certain point and I stop enjoying it. I switch to water. It's very boring, I know. I did not wear flares until they had gone out of fashion.\" It is an interesting admission. The most dangerous radicals are always personal conservatives; every waking, hangover-free hour is devoted to the cause. Far from being a dropout, Hain was an assiduous student and family man who married young, paid his electricity bills on time, saved for the future, and conscientiously sought the destruction of the apartheid state. His marriage, which produced two sons, lasted for 24 years and ended only last year. Hain is hyperactive, a morning person who is probably happiest ringing his way through a 30-person-long phone task list at 8.30am. He is the author of 13 books, including the inevitable \"political thriller\", The Peking Connection. The books are not great, but the sheer volume of them is quite an achievement. Book-writing, particularly political tomes, is a tiresome, laborious business with next to nil financial reward. One of his last acts as Foreign Office minister was to write a 60-page pamphlet, The End Of Foreign Policy, about globalisation. Again, none of the ideas is strikingly original, but since most government ministers already work 80 hours a week, squeezing a few more hours out to produce a political tract is the mark both of a highly disciplined and highly ambitious mind. Peter Hain likes to make his mark. He joined the Labour party in 1977, and worked first as a political researcher for the Communications Workers' Union and then, in the 80s, twice stood as the Labour party candidate in Putney, which, since he first arrived there, has turned into a rising middle-class enclave where ordinary three-bedroomed terrace houses cost \u00a3500,000. The powers of darkness, depending on your political view, were once more in the ascendancy, and Hain was soundly beaten in both the 1983 and 1987 general elections by David Mellor, despite energetic electoral campaigns. In 1991, the Neath constituency, near Swansea, became vacant. Hain was a metropolitan shoo-in. It was a fix, but not a bad fix. Neath is partially Welsh-speaking, and it rains a lot on the roofs of the old car part factories that are now, like their former workers, redundant. Hain, with his slight South African accent, his smooth couture, his bright suntan and silver locks, is an exotic foreigner, almost an alien species. But he is a determined constituency MP who holds 42 surgeries a year. There is a full-time agent, an office and three secretaries. His majority is 17,000. Peter Hain is not going to lose Neath. But just being an MP was never enough for Hain, who has a cold but realistic view of the average MP's life in the mother of all parliaments. \"It's almost a system for institutionalising failed ambitions. There is enormous scepticism, jealousy and envy bred. It's true whoever you are. You get elected feeling you can change the world, and what you find yourself in is a very competitive, individualised activity where you are in competition for jobs, to ask questions, to do anything. And you find out you only get it if someone else doesn't. I did not have any illusions. I saw people being swallowed up by the system.\" Hain's original route into the Labour party was via the left-wing Tribune group of MPs; eventually, he became chair of the Tribune newspaper board. His politics were typical of the time: redistribution of wealth, membership of CND, anti-European Union, pro-trades union, anti-multinationals. One unusual item in his political CV has been his support for the Falklands war. \"I supported the invasion. After what happened, I could not see how you could do anything else. You could not have Galtieri and the tyranny he represented just coming over. There did not seem to me to be any proper anti-colonial claim that justified his fascistic government ruling over the Falkland islanders.\" Hain is no pacifist, but he still retains his membership of CND - a real New Labour no-no, which is why he is careful to explain that he was never more than a rank-and-file member. It's pretty clear that he no longer believes in unilateralism, but his continued CND membership has provided the Tories, not to mention his rivals in government, with convenient ammunition for sniping and parliamentary knockabout. William Hague raised the issue at prime minister'squestions. The row has followed him into his new department, where his brief covers the nuclear industry. Hain's retort to his Tory critics is pithy: \"I still pay my \u00a39 a year to Wales CND. I happen not to agree with CND's line on the Nuclear Missile Defence [NMD], but I am not going to turn my back on people in Wales who are doing some good peace work because of some Tory critics. To hell with them, frankly.\" More important, his CND membership was at the centre of a professionally damaging leak and subsequent row over the American NMD programme last December that, according to the option a) theory of Hain's over-aggressive tactics, explains his removal from the sensitive Foreign Office portfolio. According to this theory, Hain had blundered into the radioactive political zone of Anglo-American nuclear relations by leaking a memo stating his opposition to NMD in order to curry favour with his old CND mates. First a bit of background. It's no real secret that Robin Cook, Tony Blair, the British government, the Europeans, the Russians and the Chinese are decidedly luke-warm about the updated version of the American Star Wars programme. But, as the US's most compliant \"ally\", no one in the British government has the courage openly to tell the Americans that NMD is a foolish idea that could provoke another arms race. The government's policy has been to talk and talk about NMD to the Americans, hope the missile tests all fail, and shut up in public. Enter the leaked memo, or at least a report of one, between Hain and Cook, where Hain expressed outright opposition to the US missile initiative. In private, the memo was fine, but public knowledge of its existence was a crime. NMD, CND . . . was Hain playing to his old leftie mates on the terraces for personal advancement? That, at least, was the first thought of Cook and his advisers. An immediate leak enquiry was instigated to unmask the traitor. Hain's team, in turn, thought one of Cook's team had done the deed to smear their rising star. Hain is adamant that the leak had nothing to do with him. \"Someone in the Foreign Office did it to damage me. I do not think it has anything to do with my switch to a very important job in the Department of Trade and Industry.\" Hain's last book, Ayes To The Left, A Future For Socialism, published in 1996, contains much talk of economic inequalities, freedom of information bills and making sure the intelligence services are democratically accountable. It's so far away from the New Labour norm that it reads like the manifesto of an entirely different political party from the one that Hain represents in government. In his time at the Foreign Office, Hain regularly had MI6 reports across his desk and is proud of the fact that he used that intelligence to name in Parliament Angolan sanction busters such as Victor Bout, who trade arms for diamonds. In a move that every activist dreams of, he even got to discuss his own extensive file with the head of MI5. But nothing changes, does it? To his credit, when I asked him about all those Labour plans for democratic accountability for the intelligence services, he had the grace not to pretend for more than a few seconds that it was any different today than it was 30 years ago, when he himself was under MI5 surveillance. Initially, he resisted the rise of the New Labour Project, and used the Tribune Group as a platform to challenge Blair's policy revolution. In a counter-attack, Blair and Brown turned up at a Tribune Group election to vote him off the organising committee, install their own placemen and collapse the parliamentary Tribune grouping from within. His card in New Labour terms was marked: \"If you are not a true believer in what New Labour is supposed to be about, you will never be trusted,\" says Mark Seddon, a former Labour NEC member and current editor of Tribune. \"To be trusted by New Labour, you have to recant your past. Peter Hain is rather too intelligent and more dangerous to do that.\" After his successful 1997 election campaign in Neath, Hain was appointed junior minister in the Welsh Office under Ron Davies - who famously went for a walk on Clapham Common and was forced to resign the next morning amid a frenzy of revelations of homosexual encounters and stolen cars. Davies's spectacular fall blew the Welsh Labour party apart and reopened the leadership battle for the Welsh Assembly. In a move fiercely opposed by the vast majority of the Welsh Labour party, which favoured the popular Rhodri Morgan, Tony Blair appointed Alun Michael as the new national secretary of state for Wales and then sought to have Michael elected as first minister to the forthcoming assembly. Hain was Michael's \"corner man\" in the battle for leadership in an election that mirrored the Labour London mayoral candidate debacle. It was a bruising, pointless, internecine struggle that raged through the spring of 1999. \"If Alun Michael was parachuted in, then Peter was the guy flying the plane,\" says Welsh Labour MP, Paul Flynn. \"He ran the campaign, he moved to the left, then to the right and then back again. He briefed against Rhodri.\" After lots and lots of New Labour fixing, Michael was eventually elected - only to lose a no-confidence vote and resign a year later. Morgan was duly elected leader in February 2000, and Blair's \"foreign policy\" in Wales fell apart. The Alun Michael debacle was not Hain's finest hour, and his reputation in Wales was badly tarnished. \"It was one of the least comfortable, least enjoyable, campaigns I have been involved in. And lessons have been learned, as Tony Blair himself conceded,\" he says rather uncomfortably. Nevertheless, Hain had clearly proved himself as a Blairista of sorts, and in the summer of 1999 he was brought into the Foreign Office by Robin Cook. Hain was at first regarded a great success and genuinely innovative. But within months he was involved in a whole series of diplomatic shouting matches. The first to blow up was Zimbabwe. Mugabe and Hain initially met in London in October 1999. Famously, Mugabe patted Hain on the knee and told him he was a \"son of Africa\". Things turned sour two days later, when Peter Tatchell, the gay-rights campaigner, sought to make a citizen's arrest of the African leader at his London hotel for his persecution of homosexuals in Zimbabwe. Overnight, diplomatic relations plunged as Mugabe denounced the Blair government as \"gay gangsters\". As Hain and the Foreign Office quickly came to realise, shared past histories of struggle don't count for much. \"Mugabe was violently assaulting the opposition and manipulating the land issue, which he had neglected for 10 years, to get re-elected - he was not going to listen to me or anybody else,\" says Hain, who stridently, and undiplomatically, made a point of denouncing the Mugabe regime and was criticised in particular, as a white South African, for using the term \"uncivilised\". But his sweetest triumph came last Christmas when Hain took an extended family holiday with his new partner, Elizabeth Howard, and his parents back to South Africa. He spent New Year in the holiest of shrines to the apartheid struggle, in the governor's quarters of Robben Island, the prison-turned-museum where Mandela spent 27 years. \"I never imagined being a minister, let alone being minister for Africa. Going back to South Africa seemed miraculous.\" Hain has been attacked most vehemently over his outspoken support for a string of military interventions, including Sierra Leone. His biggest battle was over Iraq, where he came under sustained assault from many of those he would have regarded as friends. For a decade, the US and Britain have unilaterally imposed no-fly zones on the Iraqi regime - regularly enforced with bombing raids. And, despite growing opposition from within the UN security council, they have maintained crippling economic blockades over Saddam Hussein's weapons programme and the continued exclusion of UN arms inspectors. Critics argue that the sanctions have done nothing to remove Saddam from power, and have rather inflicted needless suffering on the civilian Iraqi population. \"I am totally against sanctions,\" says Tony Benn. \"We have killed half a million Iraqis. Blaming that on Saddam is like blaming Churchill for the blitz. I suppose he could have stopped the blitz by surrendering to the Nazis. It's a crime against humanity.\" Hain's defence is typically robust: \"Firstly, I was responsible for the policy on Iraq. Secondly, I believe it. I don't think it's a perfect policy - far from it - but then you are dealing with an imperfect world, a horribly intractable position. I would not have started from here. I would have gone all the way to Baghdad and taken Saddam out. The strongest point in the critics' case is the suffering there has been. The weakest is what do you do about it. Their position amounts to a ferocious assault on sanctions to the point where they ignore and deny - which is extraordinary - that he has biological and chemical weapons. And that he has a research and defence capability that, within six or seven years, will probably give him a nuclear weapon. I do not accept that you can lay a charge of betrayal against me for supporting a policy that tries to contain Saddam's threat to the region.\" Because of his aggressive stance defending the bombing and sanctions policy on Iraq, Hain has shifted shape, in the eyes of his enemies, from hero to arch betrayer. He vehemently denies he has sold out. \"I come from the left, I am proudly on the left. There is an endemic culture of betrayal on the left: waiting for the next leader or spokesperson to sell you out. \"Being in government and trying to move things forward is stressful. Those who try to put pressure on government are always one-sided. But so, too, is the established position and the interests it represents. I am not saying I am no longer an activist, but you assume different roles. I still respect extra-parliamentary activists. I might not agree with them. They can regard me as a sell-out. That is their problem.\" Most politicians are nobodies. They come and they go. They rule for a brief hour and they fall and disappear. Hain is another kind of creature. He has been famous for 35 years, ever since John Harris's funeral oration in apartheid South Africa: his schoolboy picture was in the papers the next day. He likes it. He has never had an another existence; he grew up writing press releases, giving interviews, taking command, organising campaigns. He is evidently good at it. He desperately wants to keep doing it. Does he have a future in Blair's next government? Is he on option c), on the path to greater things, or option d), on the way out. No one knows, apart from the true Blairistas in the Downing Street bunker. But there is something about Hain - all that energy and activity - that probably makes him more dangerous to New Labour on the outside than in the fold. Come the summer, I wouldn't be surprised to see him walking down Downing Street on Thursday mornings for that cabinet meeting",

      "body": "<p>In his darkest hour Peter Mandelson has displayed two distinct sides of his character which, if he is not careful, will destroy what remains of his reputation.</p> <p>Amid a media scrum in his Hartlepool constituency yesterday an arrogant, and at times slightly menacing, Peter Mandelson was in evidence. As he toured his constituency, a respected local radio presenter was treated with barely concealed contempt as he tried to put the concerns of ordinary constituents to him.</p> <p>Behind this unfortunate public image, a slightly more endearing side of Mr Mandelson's character has been on display in private. Over the past week, a vulnerable Mr Mandelson has toured newspaper offices to pour out his heart over the unjust way in which he was removed from office.</p> <p>The master of spin hopes that this twin approach will help him clear his name. In public, he hopes to present himself as a dedicated constituency MP striving to improve life in Hartlepool. In private, he will mount the fight of his life to clear his name.</p> <p>But his tactics appeared to backfire. In his interview with BBC Radio Cleveland - his first since resigning - Mr Mandelson was torn apart by the veteran presenter Alan Wright as he tried to cast himself as a dedicated local MP.</p> <p>Armed with the morning newspapers, which recorded the thoughts of Mr Mandelson's \"friends\", the presenter repeatedly cut across him. At one point, he accused Mr Mandelson of having a \"brass neck\" to suggest he had no hand in the speculation that he might like to become European commissioner.</p> <p>Downing Street, which has been careful to avoid a public slanging match, could only look on in despair as Mr Mandelson inflicted more damage on the party he professes to love.</p> <p>The Mandelson camp insisted yesterday that his media campaign is proving a success. His supporters say he is ignoring pleas to remain silent because the former Northern Ireland secretary believes he is the victim of a grave injustice. His friend, author Robert Harris, underlined the depths of his despair when he compared his plight to the French Captain Dreyfus who was exiled to Devil's Island in the 1890s over trumped-up charges that he was a German spy.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson is fearful that he may not secure the official pardon which Dreyfus eventually won. He believes that unless he mounts his own vigorous defence through the media, the official inquiry into the Hinduja passport affair may leave a permanent cloud over his name.</p> <p>There is a deep suspicion in the Mandelson camp that the inquiry, which is to be chaired by the former government solicitor Sir Anthony Hammond, is a Home Office \"stitch up\". Mr Mandelson was removed from office by what friends have described as a Downing Street \"hanging bench\" after a dispute with the Home Office over his involvement in the Hinduja passport application.</p> <p>The Home Office insists that he spoke to its minister, Mike O'Brien, about the application in 1998. But Mr Mandelson says he did not speak to Mr O'Brien. His failure to provide cast iron proof on this point sealed his fate when he was summoned to Downing Street on the morning of 24 January.</p> <p>His camp believe Sir Anthony will not investigate this area, even though a memo prepared by Mr Mandelson's former officials in the Northern Ireland Office raises doubts over the Home Office account.</p> <p>One Mandelson supporter said: \"The Hammond inquiry is likely to be a Home Office stitch-up. He may not pass judgment on anything other than whether proper procedures were followed over the passport application. Hammond may feel that touching on this would be like taking a light to a petrol station.\"</p> <p>It is this doubt which prompted Mr Mandelson to spin his side of the story. His first move came in the Sunday Times four days after his resignation when he produced a lengthy account which raised more questions than it answered.</p> <p>The Mandelson camp struck again last weekend. A Northern Ireland Office memo, which said Mr O'Brien did not remember how Mr Mandelson raised the Hinduja passport, appeared in the Sunday Times.</p> <p>On the same day, the Independent on Sunday reported that Mr Mandelson was planning to \"keep on fighting\". This was prompted by a message, left on the editor, Janet Street Porter's mobile answerphone, in which he declared: \"I have got to clear my name.\"</p> <p>The next day Mr Mandelson returned to London, promising to remain silent. Behind the scenes, however, he was hard at work.</p> <p>On Wednesday he held separate meetings with senior executives of the Financial Times and the Times. This led to lengthy pieces in both papers on consecutive days which were generally favourable to Mr Mandelson. The Times concluded that his resignation \"was at best a careless occurrence and at worst a panicky one\" by Downing Street.</p> <p>The following day he made what may prove to be his most serious mistake. On the day that Tony Blair delivered his most important speech since the Labour conference, Mr Mandelson held lengthy meetings with Labour's bitterest enemies - the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>He spent 90 minutes on Thursday at the Kensington offices of the Daily Mail. From there, he was driven to the Canary Wharf office of the Daily Telegraph for a meeting with senior executives, including the editor, Charles Moore.</p> <p>This ensured the Telegraph, the Times and the Mail devoted more space to his fightback than to Mr Blair's speech. To Alastair Campbell, it may prove to be his greatest offence.</p> <p><b>'There is no point in complaining about the media. You take the rough with the smooth'</b></p> <p>Peter Mandelson interviewed by Alan Wright on BBC Radio Cleveland</p> <p><b> PM:</b> If there are any of the people who have left flowers, cakes and cards for me who are listening to me this morning I just want to thank them. I love the flowers, I've enjoyed the cakes and the cards and the letters are very, very reassuring for me. They are very comforting at a time of some distress for me.</p> <p><b> AW: </b> You've got someone listening today who is on the verge of redundancy from Corus. They'll be going through distress. They don't have the option of coming to Hartlepool for a night, then going to a party in London and then going to the US to recover. Is that an indication of how far you can get removed?</p> <p><b> PM: </b> I don't know why you're putting that in that very perjorative way.</p> <p><b> AW: </b> It's what happened.</p> <p><b> PM: </b> It isn't actually.</p> <p><b> AW: </b> It is what callers to our programme have said they don't like.</p> <p><b> PM: </b> It isn't actually what happened. It's what you think happened. If you think I am going to trawl over what I did two weekends ago after I resigned then I'm afraid I am going to disappoint you. What I will say to you is that I have a reputation in Hartlepool for attending very diligently to my constituents' needs.</p> <p><b> AW: </b> Can you put on record that there is not an intention to use the Hartlepool seat, if elected, as an avenue to become a European commissioner as some people have been saying?</p> <p><b> PM: </b> Who is saying that?</p> <p><b> AW: </b> Some of the press this morning.</p> <p><b> PM: </b> Some of the press is it? You're joking? You're not saying the press are speculating about that along with a whole number of things about me day in day out. I can't believe it Alan.</p> <p><b> AW: </b> Is the speculation untrue?</p> <p><b> PM: </b> Speculation by definition is untrue. Newspapers have got to fill their pages.

      "bodyText": "In his darkest hour Peter Mandelson has displayed two distinct sides of his character which, if he is not careful, will destroy what remains of his reputation. Amid a media scrum in his Hartlepool constituency yesterday an arrogant, and at times slightly menacing, Peter Mandelson was in evidence. As he toured his constituency, a respected local radio presenter was treated with barely concealed contempt as he tried to put the concerns of ordinary constituents to him. Behind this unfortunate public image, a slightly more endearing side of Mr Mandelson's character has been on display in private. Over the past week, a vulnerable Mr Mandelson has toured newspaper offices to pour out his heart over the unjust way in which he was removed from office. The master of spin hopes that this twin approach will help him clear his name. In public, he hopes to present himself as a dedicated constituency MP striving to improve life in Hartlepool. In private, he will mount the fight of his life to clear his name. But his tactics appeared to backfire. In his interview with BBC Radio Cleveland - his first since resigning - Mr Mandelson was torn apart by the veteran presenter Alan Wright as he tried to cast himself as a dedicated local MP. Armed with the morning newspapers, which recorded the thoughts of Mr Mandelson's \"friends\", the presenter repeatedly cut across him. At one point, he accused Mr Mandelson of having a \"brass neck\" to suggest he had no hand in the speculation that he might like to become European commissioner. Downing Street, which has been careful to avoid a public slanging match, could only look on in despair as Mr Mandelson inflicted more damage on the party he professes to love. The Mandelson camp insisted yesterday that his media campaign is proving a success. His supporters say he is ignoring pleas to remain silent because the former Northern Ireland secretary believes he is the victim of a grave injustice. His friend, author Robert Harris, underlined the depths of his despair when he compared his plight to the French Captain Dreyfus who was exiled to Devil's Island in the 1890s over trumped-up charges that he was a German spy. Mr Mandelson is fearful that he may not secure the official pardon which Dreyfus eventually won. He believes that unless he mounts his own vigorous defence through the media, the official inquiry into the Hinduja passport affair may leave a permanent cloud over his name. There is a deep suspicion in the Mandelson camp that the inquiry, which is to be chaired by the former government solicitor Sir Anthony Hammond, is a Home Office \"stitch up\". Mr Mandelson was removed from office by what friends have described as a Downing Street \"hanging bench\" after a dispute with the Home Office over his involvement in the Hinduja passport application. The Home Office insists that he spoke to its minister, Mike O'Brien, about the application in 1998. But Mr Mandelson says he did not speak to Mr O'Brien. His failure to provide cast iron proof on this point sealed his fate when he was summoned to Downing Street on the morning of 24 January. His camp believe Sir Anthony will not investigate this area, even though a memo prepared by Mr Mandelson's former officials in the Northern Ireland Office raises doubts over the Home Office account. One Mandelson supporter said: \"The Hammond inquiry is likely to be a Home Office stitch-up. He may not pass judgment on anything other than whether proper procedures were followed over the passport application. Hammond may feel that touching on this would be like taking a light to a petrol station.\" It is this doubt which prompted Mr Mandelson to spin his side of the story. His first move came in the Sunday Times four days after his resignation when he produced a lengthy account which raised more questions than it answered. The Mandelson camp struck again last weekend. A Northern Ireland Office memo, which said Mr O'Brien did not remember how Mr Mandelson raised the Hinduja passport, appeared in the Sunday Times. On the same day, the Independent on Sunday reported that Mr Mandelson was planning to \"keep on fighting\". This was prompted by a message, left on the editor, Janet Street Porter's mobile answerphone, in which he declared: \"I have got to clear my name.\" The next day Mr Mandelson returned to London, promising to remain silent. Behind the scenes, however, he was hard at work. On Wednesday he held separate meetings with senior executives of the Financial Times and the Times. This led to lengthy pieces in both papers on consecutive days which were generally favourable to Mr Mandelson. The Times concluded that his resignation \"was at best a careless occurrence and at worst a panicky one\" by Downing Street. The following day he made what may prove to be his most serious mistake. On the day that Tony Blair delivered his most important speech since the Labour conference, Mr Mandelson held lengthy meetings with Labour's bitterest enemies - the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph. He spent 90 minutes on Thursday at the Kensington offices of the Daily Mail. From there, he was driven to the Canary Wharf office of the Daily Telegraph for a meeting with senior executives, including the editor, Charles Moore. This ensured the Telegraph, the Times and the Mail devoted more space to his fightback than to Mr Blair's speech. To Alastair Campbell, it may prove to be his greatest offence. 'There is no point in complaining about the media. You take the rough with the smooth' Peter Mandelson interviewed by Alan Wright on BBC Radio Cleveland PM: If there are any of the people who have left flowers, cakes and cards for me who are listening to me this morning I just want to thank them. I love the flowers, I've enjoyed the cakes and the cards and the letters are very, very reassuring for me. They are very comforting at a time of some distress for me. AW: You've got someone listening today who is on the verge of redundancy from Corus. They'll be going through distress. They don't have the option of coming to Hartlepool for a night, then going to a party in London and then going to the US to recover. Is that an indication of how far you can get removed? PM: I don't know why you're putting that in that very perjorative way. AW: It's what happened. PM: It isn't actually. AW: It is what callers to our programme have said they don't like. PM: It isn't actually what happened. It's what you think happened. If you think I am going to trawl over what I did two weekends ago after I resigned then I'm afraid I am going to disappoint you. What I will say to you is that I have a reputation in Hartlepool for attending very diligently to my constituents' needs. AW: Can you put on record that there is not an intention to use the Hartlepool seat, if elected, as an avenue to become a European commissioner as some people have been saying? PM: Who is saying that? AW: Some of the press this morning. PM: Some of the press is it? You're joking? You're not saying the press are speculating about that along with a whole number of things about me day in day out. I can't believe it Alan. AW: Is the speculation untrue? PM: Speculation by definition is untrue. Newspapers have got to fill their pages. I wish they would fill it with things that are of real direct concern and based on fact. But there is no point in a politician complaining about the media. It is like a sailor complaining about the weather. Sometimes it is very stormy and sometimes it is beautifully still. You have to take the rough with the smooth and that is what I am doing. AW asked about his brush with a BBC cameraman PM: I came into this completely dark church yard... suddenly all the lights came on, blinding me and all the people around me.

      "body": "<p>No wonder his colleagues get so exasperated. No wonder some call him devious. \"Nothing I ever do,\" Peter Mandelson told the Independent on Sunday last weekend, \"will be designed to harm the government or the party.\" He said it at greater length in an interview for Monday's Guardian. \"No doubt the Tory party would like me to be in a dangerous and volatile mood,\" he told us, \"but I am going to disappoint them.\"</p> <p>He would do nothing to harm the party. \"The party's interests mean everything to me; they always have done.\" Nor did he echo friends who had indicated that the Hammond inquiry was not to be trusted. \"I believe I can be confident in the objectivity of the Hammond inquiry,\" he insisted. This was Mr Mandelson speaking, not some shadowy friend, declaring on the record that he was ready, despite his anger and hurt, to await the verdict of the inquiry rather than launching further media assaults.</p> <p>That was on Sunday. Four days later, as Tony Blair went to Enfield to launch his pitch for a second term, Mr Mandelson was closeted in the offices of the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph - the two newspapers, as many people in the party will note, least likely to come out for Labour at the election. The Mail and the Telegraph have developed strong sympathies for the fallen minister, not least - as such a perceptive student of newspapers must surely have realised - in the hope of using his case to discredit Tony Blair. <br><br>The results of his visits were plastered across yesterday's papers, utterly overshadowing Mr Blair's big moment at Enfield - as such a perceptive student of newspapers should have foreseen. As he read them, Mr Mandelson may just have asked himself how far these reports served the interest of the party he is pledged not to harm, and whether the Tory party he had promised to disappoint would be feeling that disappointed. If he didn't, he should have.</p> <p>There are two questions now about Mr Mandelson. The first is whether Mr Blair and senior colleagues judged him unjustly. The only answer to that is that we still do not know; we have to hope the Hammond inquiry will tell us. Anything less than a verdict of guilty as charged would be good for Mr Mandelson and unreservedly bad for Mr Blair. A straightforward \"not guilty\" finding would demonstrate that the Labour leader was driven by panic to treat him with shabby injustice. We must simply wait and see.</p> <p>The second issue is the way Mr Mandelson continues to stir up public debate. That is plainly bad for the party, but it is probably also injurious to Mr Mandelson too. Such sympathy as he has in the party (not much) is ebbing away with each media blast.

      "bodyText": "No wonder his colleagues get so exasperated. No wonder some call him devious. \"Nothing I ever do,\" Peter Mandelson told the Independent on Sunday last weekend, \"will be designed to harm the government or the party.\" He said it at greater length in an interview for Monday's Guardian. \"No doubt the Tory party would like me to be in a dangerous and volatile mood,\" he told us, \"but I am going to disappoint them.\" He would do nothing to harm the party. \"The party's interests mean everything to me; they always have done.\" Nor did he echo friends who had indicated that the Hammond inquiry was not to be trusted. \"I believe I can be confident in the objectivity of the Hammond inquiry,\" he insisted. This was Mr Mandelson speaking, not some shadowy friend, declaring on the record that he was ready, despite his anger and hurt, to await the verdict of the inquiry rather than launching further media assaults. That was on Sunday. Four days later, as Tony Blair went to Enfield to launch his pitch for a second term, Mr Mandelson was closeted in the offices of the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph - the two newspapers, as many people in the party will note, least likely to come out for Labour at the election. The Mail and the Telegraph have developed strong sympathies for the fallen minister, not least - as such a perceptive student of newspapers must surely have realised - in the hope of using his case to discredit Tony Blair. The results of his visits were plastered across yesterday's papers, utterly overshadowing Mr Blair's big moment at Enfield - as such a perceptive student of newspapers should have foreseen. As he read them, Mr Mandelson may just have asked himself how far these reports served the interest of the party he is pledged not to harm, and whether the Tory party he had promised to disappoint would be feeling that disappointed. If he didn't, he should have. There are two questions now about Mr Mandelson. The first is whether Mr Blair and senior colleagues judged him unjustly. The only answer to that is that we still do not know; we have to hope the Hammond inquiry will tell us. Anything less than a verdict of guilty as charged would be good for Mr Mandelson and unreservedly bad for Mr Blair. A straightforward \"not guilty\" finding would demonstrate that the Labour leader was driven by panic to treat him with shabby injustice. We must simply wait and see. The second issue is the way Mr Mandelson continues to stir up public debate. That is plainly bad for the party, but it is probably also injurious to Mr Mandelson too. Such sympathy as he has in the party (not much) is ebbing away with each media blast. Still worse is the way that, according to the Mail and Telegraph, Mr Mandelson's \"friends\" are saying that a place on the European Commission would be some fitting recompense. \"There is ill-disguised disappointment,\" the Mail reported, \"in senior Labour circles that the present commissioneers, former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and former Tory chairman Chris Patten have failed to make much impact.\" \"He believes,\" the Mail also said, again quoting \"friends\", \"he is ideally suited to the challenge of shaking up the cumbersome and corruption-ridden bureaucracy at the heart of the EU.\" And maybe he is. But now that someone's gone public, giving the job to him would look like a payoff stipulated by him and meekly delivered by the PM. Our advice remains as it was at the start of the week. If he means what he says about loyalty, he and his \"friends\" should try to keep their tongues firmly under control until Hammond has spoken.

In his first letter he says that he has known the minister for 15 years. \"I have sponsored or taken a table at various Asian and charity events which Mr Vaz has also supported. I believe in 1993 or 1994 Mr Vaz asked me if I would help out one such charity. I agreed to make a contribution of \u00a31,000. The code of conduct requires MPs \"in carrying out public business, making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits, holders of public office should make choices on merit\". Mr Vaz's lawyer Geoffrey Bindman said yesterday: \"In fairness to Mr Zaiwalla, it should be made clear that he has been consistent throughout the inquiry in stating that he has never made any cash payment to Mr Vaz or any other payment to him personally or for his personal benefit. Mr Vaz, of course, has confirmed that he has never received any such payment.\"",

Evelyn Burton, 57, and Lyla Andre, 50, who had been a brothel owner in Australia, became the toast of top horse racing and show jumping events. They rubbed shoulders with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh after creating an illusion of wealth. The pair gained access to seats in the royal box at the Royal Windsor Horse Show four years ago by pledging \u00a3176,000 sponsorship. The cheque bounced, Wood Green crown court in north London was told, because the pair had woven a patchwork of lies to fund an extravagant lifestyle that included stays at London hotels such as the Berkley in Knightsbridge. Burton posed as an international banker and travelled in either a chauffeur-driven gold Rolls Royce or a stretch limousine. Together with an American lawyer, Daniel Wright, who has not been prosecuted but has been investigated by the FBI, she persuaded members of the wealthy set to invest in her US registered company, Westgate Development Corporation, by offering them bumper returns on investments of around $300,000, or \u00a3200,000. The list of victims included Michael Bullen, a former equerry to the Queen, who is the only victim to have had his \u00a360,000 investment returned by Burton's associate, Wright. Two Swedish businessmen, Mats Anderson and Goran Agneuk, lost \u00a3185,000; Frank Wright and Ed Vogel from the US lost \u00a3184,000; and Belfast businessmen Henry Curry and James Morrison lost \u00a393,000, as did Norfolk farmer Kevin Childerhouse. The money, which Burton promised to invest in bonds, was spent on horses and high living as well as finding its way into the bank account of Andre. The total losses added up to \u00a3557,000, the court heard. The pair came to the UK from Australia in 1995 after being wanted by police there. Dorian Lovell-Pen QC, defending Andre, Burton's partner of 20 years, said that she was not party to conning investors and had lived as Burton's virtual housewife. \"The only area where she was successful was in high class prostitution,\" he said. \"She is regarded in Australia as a highly discreet and successful operator with a socially impressive clientele.\" Burton, who was said to suffer from a list of health problems was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to one charge of conspiracy to defraud between October 1996 and March 1998. Andre was sentenced to three years and eight months after admitting one charge of retaining a wrongful credit and two of evading a liability by deception. The last two offences concerned the deception of the Right Honourable Mary Ann Wragg, a former president of the Arab Horse Society, and one of its members, Margaret Morgan, out of promised winnings at the annual show held at Haydock Park racetrack. The court was told that the two fled to New Zealand , where they were arrested in 1999 and extradited at the request of the serious fraud office. Judge Peter Ader said: \"It was a well planned and executed fraud that was highly successful. It required a ruthlessness in dealing with investors and a callous indifference to those they duped.\"",

Judge Graham Cottle said that in sentencing a fortnight ago he had neglected mitigation - the defendant's character and his remorse over the head-crash on the North Devon link road in which a journalist died.

The seven-year-old, Xena, and foal, were said to be doing well three days after surgery.

The frigate had left Plymouth on Thursday for a six-month voyage that will include anti-drug patrols in the Caribbean.

      "bodyText": "Joan Smith (All talk, no action, G2, February 9) has her sci-fi sex machines in a twist. The Ogasmatron was not the execution-by-orgasm machine in Barbarella. It was a booth-like item in Woody Allen's Sleepers used by futuristic hippies, into which they disappeared for ultra-safe sex, emerging in a blissed-out state. The villain of Barbarella, called \"Duran Duran\", merely refers to his electric piano-like device as a \"pleasure machine\". It undoubtedly gave rise to many a male fantasy, though. The 80s pop group who took Duran Duran's name doubtless fantasised that the erotic pleasures of pop-musical orgasm were theirs to command. How wrong can you be? Paul Barlow South Shields, Tyne and Wear paul.barlow@unn.ac.uk As a serious contribution to the debate, may I point out that the machine couldn't handle Jane Fonda, and Woody Allen couldn't handle the machine? Barry Hankey Pontypool, Gwent HANKEBR@CAERPHILLY.GOV.UK Cliff Richard (Letters, February 8)? Pah! The true pop prince of darkness is Bobby Vee. His 1963 hit The Night Has a Thousand Eyes is a veritable paean to male paranoia, every line brimming with menace and promises of what Bobby is going to do should his girl \"go astray\". And as for Sharing You and Run To Him ... Rob Chapman Manchester For chanson noire, consider Delilah, in which Tom Jones sings about knifing his girlfriend after watching her new boyfriend leave. Bob Nicholson Frodsham, Cheshire bob-nicassoc@btinternet.com So the police have been tipped off to dig for gold in a place called Ore (Police dig for Brink's-Mat gold after underworld tipoff, February 9). One can't help feeling a little suspicious that it may be a case of underworld sauce, rather than source. John S Preston Winchester, Hants jspreston@winchester126.freeserve.co.uk Your report stated that police are digging for the Brinks-Mat gold near Hastings in Kent. Was this translocation an attempt by the police or yourselves to mislead rival diggers? Brian P Moss Tamworth, Staffs BrianMoss@NorthWarks.gov.uk In your report on footballers with false passports (Sport, February 9) you say that an Argentine midfielder is charged with inventing an Italian grandmother. I imagine that he is actually charged with some kind of fraud, but your phrase conjures up a splendid image, one that I hope JK Rowling will develop in the next Harry Potter. JD Mackay Warwick",

Many pilots have been enticed by the higher salaries offered by commercial airlines.</p> <p>Under the financial retention incentives schemes, RAF pilots and navigators who have been flying for three years and who have attained the rank of squadron leader or flight lieutenant will receive an annual \u00a310,000 bonus. Other ranks who have been serving for 16 years or who have turned 37 will receive the same amount.</p> <p>And specialist air crew who decide to continue flying rather than take the offer of a promotion to a role on the ground will be given an additional \u00a310,000 if they are 38 to 40, \u00a37,500 if they are 41 to 49, and \u00a35,000 if they are 50 to 53.</p> <p>The moves were announced yesterday as ministers also accepted an inflation-beating pay rise of 3% but following a five-year old Labour pledge they will continue to take less than their full entitlement.</p> <p>The rise, for all MPs from April 1, was in line with the recommendations of the senior salaries review body which awarded the same increase to 3,000 senior civil servants at a cost of \u00a36.5m.</p> <p>MPs' pay has been linked to the senior civil service automatically for several years, to avoid the Commons having to vote itself for any uprating.</p> <p>A backbencher's salary will go up to \u00a349,822 from \u00a348,371 and may increase further when a separate independent review of MPs' pay and allowances is published next month.</p> <p>The government also accepted a recommendation from the board for a 3.7% rise for 1,700 judges, costing \u00a36m, and a recommendation from the armed forces pay review body for a 3.7% rise for 119 senior officers and 210,000 regular armed forces personnel.</p> <p>One of the curious side-effects of ministerial denial is that William Hague will earn more than a cabinet minister. His salary rises from \u00a3109,030 to \u00a3112,301 while senior ministers will take \u00a399,793 out of an entitlement of \u00a3117,969.</p> <p>Ministers, including Mr Blair, have not taken their full pay since coming to office and that tradition will continue at least until the report in March, No 10 said yesterday.</p> <p>Mr Blair currently takes \u00a3112,951 of the \u00a3158,658 he is entitled to and that will increase to \u00a3116,339 - with the entitlement increased to \u00a3163,418.</p> <p>Junior ministers' pay will rise from \u00a382,697 to \u00a385,178 and parliamentary under secretaries of states' from \u00a374,424 to \u00a376,657.</p> <p>In the Lords, ministers of cabinet rank who now take \u00a372,729 of the \u00a385,983 they are entitled to will get \u00a374,911 of an \u00a388,562 entitlement.</p> <p>Lord Irvine, the Lord Chancellor, the highest paid member of the government, will see his pay increase by 3% on his current \u00a3167,760 salary.</p> <p>Unison, the country's biggest union, said it did not begrudge the MPs their pay rise. But a spokeswoman said: \"If MPs are worth that much money, surely the minimum wage should be increased to \u00a35 an hour.\"</p> <p>Jeff Masters of the low pay unit pointed out that the 1.5m workers on the minimum wage had had only one pay rise of just 10p an hour in almost two years.</p> <p><b>New pay</b></p> <p>Junior minister<b> \u00a385,178</b></p> <p>Under secretary of state <b> \u00a376,657</b></p> <p>Brigadier up to <b> \u00a374,135</b></p> <p>Wing cdr up to <b> \u00a356,586</b></p> <p>Lieutenant up to <b> \u00a324,973</b></p> <p>Private up to <b> \u00a322,101</b></p> <p>High court judge <b> \u00a3132,603</b></p> <p>Circuit judge <b> \u00a399,420</b></p>",

      "bodyText": "Sea Harrier pilots are to be given a \u00a350,000 bonus to persuade them to stay in the navy under a special pay package announced yesterday. The award is a one-off payment for up to 16 pilots in the Fleet Air Arm which faces a crisis, the Ministry of Defence said, and follows the recommendations of the armed forces pay review board. RAF air crew will also receive special pay increases of up to \u00a310,000 a year in an attempt to stop resignations. Many pilots have been enticed by the higher salaries offered by commercial airlines. Under the financial retention incentives schemes, RAF pilots and navigators who have been flying for three years and who have attained the rank of squadron leader or flight lieutenant will receive an annual \u00a310,000 bonus. Other ranks who have been serving for 16 years or who have turned 37 will receive the same amount. And specialist air crew who decide to continue flying rather than take the offer of a promotion to a role on the ground will be given an additional \u00a310,000 if they are 38 to 40, \u00a37,500 if they are 41 to 49, and \u00a35,000 if they are 50 to 53. The moves were announced yesterday as ministers also accepted an inflation-beating pay rise of 3% but following a five-year old Labour pledge they will continue to take less than their full entitlement. The rise, for all MPs from April 1, was in line with the recommendations of the senior salaries review body which awarded the same increase to 3,000 senior civil servants at a cost of \u00a36.5m. MPs' pay has been linked to the senior civil service automatically for several years, to avoid the Commons having to vote itself for any uprating. A backbencher's salary will go up to \u00a349,822 from \u00a348,371 and may increase further when a separate independent review of MPs' pay and allowances is published next month. The government also accepted a recommendation from the board for a 3.7% rise for 1,700 judges, costing \u00a36m, and a recommendation from the armed forces pay review body for a 3.7% rise for 119 senior officers and 210,000 regular armed forces personnel. One of the curious side-effects of ministerial denial is that William Hague will earn more than a cabinet minister. His salary rises from \u00a3109,030 to \u00a3112,301 while senior ministers will take \u00a399,793 out of an entitlement of \u00a3117,969. Ministers, including Mr Blair, have not taken their full pay since coming to office and that tradition will continue at least until the report in March, No 10 said yesterday. Mr Blair currently takes \u00a3112,951 of the \u00a3158,658 he is entitled to and that will increase to \u00a3116,339 - with the entitlement increased to \u00a3163,418. Junior ministers' pay will rise from \u00a382,697 to \u00a385,178 and parliamentary under secretaries of states' from \u00a374,424 to \u00a376,657. In the Lords, ministers of cabinet rank who now take \u00a372,729 of the \u00a385,983 they are entitled to will get \u00a374,911 of an \u00a388,562 entitlement. Lord Irvine, the Lord Chancellor, the highest paid member of the government, will see his pay increase by 3% on his current \u00a3167,760 salary. Unison, the country's biggest union, said it did not begrudge the MPs their pay rise. But a spokeswoman said: \"If MPs are worth that much money, surely the minimum wage should be increased to \u00a35 an hour.\" Jeff Masters of the low pay unit pointed out that the 1.5m workers on the minimum wage had had only one pay rise of just 10p an hour in almost two years. New pay Junior minister \u00a385,178 Under secretary of state \u00a376,657 Brigadier up to \u00a374,135 Wing cdr up to \u00a356,586 Lieutenant up to \u00a324,973 Private up to \u00a322,101 High court judge \u00a3132,603 Circuit judge \u00a399,420",

      "body": "<p> If only followers of the faiths charted here could have co-existed as snugly as these six cassettes in their cases. To trace the divergent paths of Catholicism, Orthodox Christianity and Protestantism and their Judaic parent is inevitably a battlefield tour. These admirable potted histories are read in suitably solemn tones by Ben Kingsley. The schisms and differences are explained with clarity, and there's a useful guide to those great councils of the early church. The unnamed author deserves credit, but the production is marred by dire musical punctuation - there is hardly a shortage of good Christian music, for instance, so why not use it?

To trace the divergent paths of Catholicism, Orthodox Christianity and Protestantism and their Judaic parent is inevitably a battlefield tour. These admirable potted histories are read in suitably solemn tones by Ben Kingsley. The schisms and differences are explained with clarity, and there's a useful guide to those great councils of the early church. The unnamed author deserves credit, but the production is marred by dire musical punctuation - there is hardly a shortage of good Christian music, for instance, so why not use it? The effect is also dented by the comic voices used by the readers of textual excerpts. It's absurd and distracting to have early patriarchs or popes speaking English with the accents of modern Germans, Greeks or Russians.",

The biggest gallego cemetery in the world is in Havana, the biggest gallego city in the world is Buenos Aires. And so much emigration has made Galicia cosmopolitan. I remember looking in the suitcases of emigrants returned from overseas. The whole world was inside. They were like books.\" </p> <p>Rivas, born in 1957, writes in Galician.

It is a story that he had in his mind for several years, after going to interview an old man returned from exile. \"I arrived at 10 am and didn't leave till three the next morning.\" Many years later, it was his carpenter grandfather's pencil which gave him the oblique approach that allowed him to tell a great love story without falling into sentimentality.

      "bodyText": "Manuel Rivas lives in a village on the Costa del morte, the wild coast of shipwrecks and gales between Cape Finisterre, the ancients' end of the world, and A Coru\u00f1a - the Corunna of Sir John Moore's famous retreat and tomb - in Galicia in North-west Spain. \"But do not think Galicia is remote,\" Rivas tells me. \"This is a land of emigration. The biggest gallego cemetery in the world is in Havana, the biggest gallego city in the world is Buenos Aires. And so much emigration has made Galicia cosmopolitan. I remember looking in the suitcases of emigrants returned from overseas. The whole world was inside. They were like books.\" Rivas, born in 1957, writes in Galician. His novel, The Carpenter's Pencil , just out from Harvill, is the first to have been translated directly into English without going through the intermediary of Castilian Spanish. He was brought up in the workers' barrio of A Coru\u00f1a, a city on a rocky peninsula shaped like a boat pushing out to sea. \"The streets we played in were in a triangle formed by the prison on one side, the cemetery on the other full of drowned sailors, and the Tower of Hercules lighthouse on the cliff above us.\" From the lighthouse, the street-children watched the daily ships full of emigrants fleeing Franco's Spain.

Rolling out of bed, I saw through the window an army column that had just crossed the junction below. A gunner on the tail truck had fanned his machine gun, spraying a sparse crowd with fire. By the time I reached ground level, the army had disappeared and several bodies were being rushed away. All that remained was a satchel of books on an abandoned bike, some bloodstains and projectile holes, and two suitcases belonging to a man who had just walked up from the railway station. His friend urged me to note down that \"he came from Qiqihar\" in the north-east. This casual episode of military brutality, which I witnessed on the morning of June 7, 1989, dramatised in miniature the huge shock three nights earlier when much larger army units barrelled into Tiananmen Square, shooting down protesters and bystanders on the way. How, asked the citizens of Beijing, could the People's Army treat the people like this? </p> <p> The Tiananmen Papers , which claims to be based on original documentation of the time, may help us find a fuller answer to this question. The present volume is an edited selection with commentary, containing only a small percentage of the \"several thousand\" documents to which the pseudonymous compiler Zhang Liang - described as an ex-civil servant - says he had access. Putting doubts aside, I have found several gripping passages which may explain why \"the man from Qiqihar\" was mown down. </p> <p>The 38th Group Army, which did most of the killing on June 3-4, submitted a self-justifying report to the Central Military Commission giving a very partial account of its advance from the east into Tiananmen Square. It hailed the bravery of its officers and soldiers faced with \"rioters with clubs and steel reinforcing bars\". It said (correctly, I believe) that \"in clearing the square the officers and soldiers . . . did not kill a single person with rifle fire\". But it was silent about the people it had killed on the way. All armies of all nationalities lie when reporting to their superiors. Information from security agents is usually more reliable, because informing is their job. The most illuminating material here comes from agents of the State Security Ministry, who sometimes seem to show sympathy for the students. In their version of the slaughter, the protesters hurled bricks and rocks, and pushed trolley buses and other vehicles in the army's way. The troops then \"turned their weapons on the crowd . . . People began crumpling to the ground.\" </p> <p>Soon, there were \"no more lulls in the shooting\". Whenever rocks were hurled, or verbal insults were shouted, the soldiers \"fired into the crowd\". Did the man from Qiqihar, or some other bystander on that grey morning of the 7th, utter a \"verbal insult\"? Did the tail gunner imagine he spotted someone with a rock? There is another clue in a report from Martial Law headquarters to the ruling Communist Party Politburo three days before the massacre. It admitted that \"the troops . . . are entering an urban centre [for the first time]\". Perhaps the tail gunner was a raw peasant recruit and simply panicked. </p> <p> The Tiananmen Papers allows us to follow much more closely than before the tangled sequence of events over the previous two months that led China's \"Party elders\" to order in the troops. The students had first occupied the square after the death of the popular pro-reform ex-Party secretary General Hu Yaobang, sacked two years before by the ageing conservatives who feared the pace of change. The elders, headed by Deng Xiaoping, were officially retired, but continued to be \"consulted\". When the Politburo Standing Committee split over how to handle the protest, the elders took over. </p> <p>The documents confirm that there was considerable sympathy for the students among more liberal Party leaders. The conciliatory position of Hu's successor Zhao Ziyang - eventually sacked by the elders - is well known. But several others favoured dialogue, too. \"We should take a sober look at what has caused the strong rebellious streak in the popular mood,\" argued the ex-worker Li Ruihuan. \"I still believe that the great majority . . . mean well,\" said Vice-Premier Wan Li, who was heavily leant on to prevent him taking their side. </p> <p>Yet it is also clear that the learning curve that the student protests inflicted upon the Party elders was simply too steep and too swift. Their sympathy towards the original complaints about corruption waned as calls for democracy grew. What was China coming to when thousands joined in a \"demonstration by bicycle\" and students from the Beijing Fashion College suggested officials should wear bikinis \"to increase the transparency of government\"? The enthusiasm of the foreign press - which enjoyed during those weeks a freedom it has never since recovered - also alarmed the leaders. They were even more alarmed when the students began to \"network\" across the country, bringing back memories of the Red Guards. They were disconcerted by the hunger strike in the square, and baffled when student leaders confessed that they could no longer control their own supporters. </p> <p>The most wounding blow to the elders came after a failure to persuade the students to clear the square for the visit of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. This historic summit of reconciliation between the former \"fraternal Parties\" was turned into farce. \"What do we look like if the square's a mess?\" Deng Xiaoping complained. Yang Shangkun, a relatively moderate figure, exploded that \"pretty soon we won't be able to call this capital our own any more\". The Gorbachev fiasco led directly to the decision to declare martial law. This in turn stiffened the students' determination and brought thousands of outraged Beijing citizens to their side. </p> <p>In retrospect, the sending in of the tanks after two weeks of stalemate seems inevitable. In theory, the leadership struggle between Zhao Ziyang and then Premier Li Peng - broadly speaking, a struggle between moderates and hardliners - could have gone the other way. But the documents show that from the perspective of 40 years of Party rule, Li's arguments were bound to prevail. It had become a question of \"us or them\". Losing patience, Deng decided that the west was \"stirring up turmoil\" by its support for people who were \"the scum of the Chinese nation\". Ex-general Wang Zhen said: \"Anyone who tries to overthrow the Communist Party deserves death and no burial.\" A preliminary attempt to infiltrate army units peacefully was frustrated by the Beijing citizens who chased them away, allowing Mr Li to insist that \"we have to be absolutely firm\". The Beijing military commander told the elders that his troops were \"swallowing their anger and fuming inside\". The decision to send in the troops authorised the use of force, although not under any circumstances in the square itself. As Wang Zhen again put it: \"If it causes deaths, that's their own fault.\" </p> <p> The Tiananmen Papers is billed as \"an astonishing account . . . from inside the heart of the Politburo itself\". The documents said to have been brought out by Zhang Liang have been culled, according to the US editors, to highlight \"the decision-making process\". Though fascinating in detail, the only area on which they cast significant new light is the way that Jiang Zemin (now supreme leader), who had handled protests in Shanghai firmly but without bloodshed, was secretly chosen by the elders to replace the discredited Mr Zhao. </p> <p>Sooner or later, China is going to \"reverse the verdicts\" on what happened in June 1989. The Tiananmen Papers has brought the issue back into focus at the right time, when the leadership is facing a new round of change in the next two to three years. Yet we cannot gloss over the problems raised by the documents. Firstly, we do not yet have the original Chinese texts. Although Zhang Liang wanted the book to be published in Chinese first, he was overruled. A fuller edition in Chinese will be published, we are told, in March or April. More seriously, the quotes given above may not be real quotes at all. Mr Zhang \"has combined information [from different sources] to reconstruct most of the accounts of conversations throughout the book\"; the editors have used quotation marks because the materials come from \"immediate participants\" and are \"often mutually corroborative\". To put it mildly, this is not best scholarly practice. </p> <p>Also very serious - as acknowledged by the distinguished editors, Andrew Nathan and Perry Link - is the fact that they have not seen a single photocopy of an original document. In a careful postscript on authentication, another well-known US China academic, Orville Schell, says that Mr Zhang clung to a distinction between passing on original documents (which would be \"unpatriotic\") and \"merely [passing] the reformatted contents on to foreigners like us and hence to the world at large\". The editors thought this was \"illogical\" but decided to respect Mr Zhang's \"terms of the game\". I find this touching, but a shade naive. It also raises another question: how did Mr Zhang manage to \"reformat\" what we are told were \"several thousand documents\" - apparently chosen from an even larger number - in a situation where he risked execution for copying even one? </p> <p>The character of Mr Zhang himself, as revealed in his brief preface, is also puzzling. We are told that he is or was an insider who speaks for a much broader pro-reform constituency in the Party. Yet on the very first page of the book, he writes much more like an outsider, recalling \"the blood of thousands of young people spilled on the streets\" of Beijing. This is hyperbole, not history, and dated hyperbole too. I believe these documents are, broadly speaking, \"genuine\", but within limits which no one can yet clearly define. The next step should be to produce the full texts of the documents. If they already exist in a \"reformatted\" version, Mr Zhang has only to deposit them on a website for everyone to read. Millions of Chinese would be the gainers - and some sympathetic but concerned China scholars too.</p>",

To entertain it, even ironically, may involve becoming part of it. English parodies of English attitudes serve, at times, to reinforce them. The octopus of national myth is the dread and cunning beast faced by the distinguished novelist Maureen Duffy in England: The Making of the Myth . Duffy undertakes to follow the emergence of ideas and feelings of Englishness from pre-Roman times to the present.

For all Duffy's breadth of interest - language, politics, social history, the lives of women, class, literature, music - this is history in captions. She cites E P Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class , for example, but must gesture in a few pages at the scope of his 800-odd. At some points the method is reminiscent of Olivier's speech as Nelson to Lady Hamilton on a balcony in Naples in some dire old movie, in which he is obliged to list every event of the Napoleonic period in order and pretend he talks like this all the time.

What's needed is aphorism, but what we get is hurried journalism, with some unfortunate simplifications. Turning to Shakespeare, for example, Duffy reads Gaunt's deathbed speech in Richard II with such flat scepticism about its presentation of \"Englishness\" as to miss its dramatic complexity entirely. She is also a subscriber to the \"Shakespeare must have known/done x, y and z\" approach, which is like mythology squared and which places her weirdly in the beery company of late-19th-century inventors of literary Englishness. Turning to the present, her assertion that most English people dislike racism is either optimistic or wishful. </p> <p>Many readers of this newspaper will find much to agree with in Duffy's gallop through history from woad via Wotan to Blair/ Brown plc. At the same time, they may wonder at a book that is so clearly misconceived. Though England reads for the most part like an earnest remedial textbook for a period ignorant of history, Duffy's prose is at times also the jittery, distracted, powerless descendant of the great English essay tradition that links Johnson, Hazlitt, Carlyle, Virginia Woolf and Orwell. In its threadbare style and its unwitting subjugation to some of the habits it seeks to describe, it provides, by a sort of anti-eloquence, a grim picture of the plight of contemporary writing, never mind Englishness.

Irving put Lukacs's British literary agent on notice that he would take advantage of this country's more plaintiff-friendly libel laws if it saw publication here. Only when the allegations were upheld in an associated case in the High Court last year could publication of the book go ahead in Britain - though what has emerged is a much less incisive attack on Irving. The publisher appears to have made the emollient changes before the High Court judgment. </p> <p>In itself, this book is an example of historiography: the history of the study of history. But anyone alarmed by reminders of dreadful set texts at school or university can calm their beating hearts. Though The Hitler of History has its arid moments, it reads more like a lively biography than anything else. Much of the historiography proper - and the academic sniping - is reserved for the footnotes. The book addresses the key questions about the character and phenomenon of Hitler by comparing the material of more than 100 biographies of him, and the picture it draws is convincing. </p> <p>The key to Hitler's ideology, and his shift from colourless insignificant to dangerous charismatic, lies in the failed Bolshevik republic in Munich in 1919, rather than Vienna, pre-war Bavaria or the trenches. He was a revolutionary rather than a reactionary, closer to socialism than to conservatism, and he used his sense of the progressive to retain massive German popular support until the end. He also understood the importance of Christianity to the German people. An essentially secretive man, he always tailored his message to his audience and yet was able simultaneously to believe in two or more explicitly contradictory ideas. He was a product of German history, though not an inevitable one. </p> <p>Other questions, Lukacs acknowledges, remain unanswerable. How did Hitler spend the three months of Bavaria's Red Terror? Did he ever give an order for the Final Solution? Above all, whence came his apparently utterly irrational loathing of Jewish people? </p> <p>Lukacs's intelligence and mastery of his sources provide a far more nuanced, convincing Hitler than most of the biographers he examines, but his vision fails him in his assessment of Hitler as strategist. Yet here, too, there are shafts of insight. The idea that Hitler fought on after December 1941 believing that a victory of annihilation was impossible for either side - and so directed his strategy at causing one of the three principal Allies to make a negotiated peace - rings true, as does the assessment that Hitler's true strategic gift was in his instinct for others' weakness. But much of the rest of this chapter strikes one as wrong. </p> <p>For instance, he credits Hitler with correctly understanding the novel supremacy of land power over maritime, made possible by military motorisation. But it was exactly this understanding that doomed the Third Reich. Hitler could not win the war if he lost the battle at sea; the Allies could not win it if they failed to defeat the Axis on land. By gradually shifting resources away from the only battle that might conceivably have driven Britain and America to peace - the Battle of the Atlantic - Hitler ensured his eventual defeat. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Lukacs's explanation of one of the most baffling questions - why did Hitler declare war against the US in December 1941? - is frankly feeble. He says Hitler could hardly renege on his alliance with Japan by refusing to abide by its first article, a simultaneous declaration of war. But Hitler had always ignored agreements that had served their purpose, and his dealings with Tokyo had none of the strong personal and ideological ties that caused him to launch disastrous enterprises on Mussolini's behalf. If he had let the Japanese fight the USA on their own, Roosevelt would eventually have turned on Germany; but the intervening period would have provided the breathing space Hitler so desperately needed. </p> <p>Yet the book's major flaw remains the fault of the publishers rather than the author. Since its original publication, David Irving's libel suit and Daniel Goldhagen's Hitler's Willing Executioners have twice brought historiography into the British headlines. Ian Kershaw's massive, widely hailed two-volume biography has also shed considerable light on Hitler. It would have been interesting to get Lukacs's take on all these issues, yet none - not even the Irving trial, probably the most exciting thing ever to happen in historiography - gets a mention. And the book is subtitled Hitler's Biographers on Trial . </p> <p>Anyone who wants an intelligent, cohesive, generally convincing analysis of Hitler's character through the medium of those who have written about him will be entirely happy with The Hitler of History as it stands. Anyone who wants context for the news events of the last four years should wait for another edition.</p>",

Eliot, like Eminem, has been having a rough ride of late, with various commentators denouncing him for anti-Semitism in particular and establishment snobbery in general; the contumely has shaken the foundations of his reputation. For those more sympathetic to him, his widow's hawklike attention to, and protection of, his residua has begun to irritate scholars and the ordinarily curious. (When's that second volume of letters coming out, eh? And will all the good stuff be kept out of it?) </p> <p>So with this book we go back to first principles; the collection with which he made his mark. No introduction, no notes, no help with the epigraph from Dante that ushers us into \"The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock\". So you read it all through, straight, and the enigmatic force of his early poetry strikes you again, and you begin to get an idea of how the first readers of the work must have been utterly disoriented in 1917, if they were on the ball enough to pick up the Egoist press edition. (Faber first published him in 1925.) </p> <p>What would they have made of it? Echoes from all strata of lyrical art, from Dante and Shakespeare to popular songs (\"Is it perfume from a dress/ That makes me so digress?\") to Edward Lear: I defy you not to hear the cadences of \"The Courtship of the Yongy Bongy Bo\" in these lines from \"Portrait of a Lady\": \"We must leave it now to fate./ You will write, at any rate./ Perhaps it is not too late.\" The facile conclusion may well have been that here was a poet with only a slippery grip on his own sanity; and this indeed may have been the case. </p> <p>But what is useful and remarkable about reading it like this, so stripped of context, is that you no longer feel compelled to read them as a student (which is probably how most people come to them in the first place). No symbol-hunting, no anxious marginal notes (\"NB imagery\", etc), just a concentration on the sense the words reveal, bit by bit. It is striking how contemporary the poems still seem; they haven't dated, and they survive all the countless imitations of his work that have appeared in the intervening century.</p>",

For those more sympathetic to him, his widow's hawklike attention to, and protection of, his residua has begun to irritate scholars and the ordinarily curious. (When's that second volume of letters coming out, eh? And will all the good stuff be kept out of it?) So with this book we go back to first principles; the collection with which he made his mark. No introduction, no notes, no help with the epigraph from Dante that ushers us into \"The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock\". So you read it all through, straight, and the enigmatic force of his early poetry strikes you again, and you begin to get an idea of how the first readers of the work must have been utterly disoriented in 1917, if they were on the ball enough to pick up the Egoist press edition. (Faber first published him in 1925.) What would they have made of it? Echoes from all strata of lyrical art, from Dante and Shakespeare to popular songs (\"Is it perfume from a dress/ That makes me so digress?\") to Edward Lear: I defy you not to hear the cadences of \"The Courtship of the Yongy Bongy Bo\" in these lines from \"Portrait of a Lady\": \"We must leave it now to fate./ You will write, at any rate./ Perhaps it is not too late.\" The facile conclusion may well have been that here was a poet with only a slippery grip on his own sanity; and this indeed may have been the case. But what is useful and remarkable about reading it like this, so stripped of context, is that you no longer feel compelled to read them as a student (which is probably how most people come to them in the first place). No symbol-hunting, no anxious marginal notes (\"NB imagery\", etc), just a concentration on the sense the words reveal, bit by bit. It is striking how contemporary the poems still seem; they haven't dated, and they survive all the countless imitations of his work that have appeared in the intervening century.",

Four years after his death in 1611, his name came up in the sensational trial for murder of Frances Howard, Countess of Essex, and Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset, who was a favourite of King James I. Forman, it was alleged, had been consulted on Howard's behalf by one of her ladies, Anne Turner, in search of a love potion to ensure the continued attentions of Carr and a concoction to ensure the impotence of her husband. If Howard knew where to procure prescriptions from quack doctors, the prosecution argued, she was capable of getting hold of the arsenic with which she and her lover had allegedly murdered the man who stood in the way of their marriage, Thomas Overbury. As is the way with such media scandals, the story was soon amplified to make Forman the supplier of the poison, so it was just as well he was safely dead. Poor Anne Turner was hanged for her part in the conspiracy; Howard and Robert, however, were eventually pardoned by the King. </p> <p>It was the popular historian A L Rowse, digging deep into the Elizabethan archives, who found and published Simon Forman's \"Casebooks\" in 1974 under the title Sex and Society in Shakespeare's Age . He introduced the general public to a man with a colourful career as a brewer of exotic potions and a sexual appetite to rival that of another famous diarist, Samuel Pepys. Both men seemed to have a charming disregard for the background of their sexual conquests, as well as for the location of consummation - which Forman refers to in a somewhat transparent code as \"haleking\". </p> <p>Rowse discovered Forman's manuscripts while in pursuit of the \"dark lady\" of Shakespeare's sonnets, whom he identified as the poet Aemilia Lanyer. Lanyer had asked Forman to cast her husband's horoscope prior to a business venture, and had subsequently, like a number of other female clients, had a brief affair with the doctor. The diaries were a revelation to a public accustomed to thinking of Elizabethan life as strait-laced and austere, and their publication produced a rash of academic articles relishing their explicit promiscuity. </p> <p>They record, for instance, an erotic dream Forman had in which he was walking with Queen Elizabeth herself, who was all \"unready\", wearing only a shift and a petticoat. When they trailed in the mud Forman lifted them and lewdly asked if he could \"wait upon\" her, \"that I might make this belly a little bigger\". Even 400 years ago, a man with something of an inferiority complex might compensate in his dreams with fantasies of bedding the monarch. </p> <p>Shakespeare scholars have long treasured Forman's diaries as rare first-hand records of visits to the London theatres, including details of performances of Macbeth , The Winter's Tale and Cymbeline . He was not, however, very good at remembering how the plot went - in his version it is Macbeth rather than his wife who attempts vainly to wash the imagined blood of Duncan from his hands. </p> <p>Yet Simon Forman has always been a footnote - an afterthought in other people's stories. The purpose of these new books is to retrieve the \"real man\" behind the anecdotes and innuendo, and to argue that Forman's professional life as a medical man and caster of horoscopes was more serious and interesting than hitherto believed. </p> <p>Judith Cook's is an avowedly popularising romp through Elizabethan England which constructs around the armature of Forman's writings a sentimental \"life and times\" recalling the film Shakespeare in Love - all street noise, colour and smells. Her strategy is to move surreptitiously from an entry in Forman's diary to events in London around that date - in none of which is there any evidence that Forman was involved. So an entry for 1599 telling us that he \"bought much harness and weapons for war, swords, daggers, muskets, corselets and furniture, staves, halberds\" becomes the occasion for a digression on the impending Essex rebellion, after which Cook remarks that he \"had more on his mind than Essex's expedition\" and returns to a colourful story of a paternity suit. </p> <p>Traister, in her far more serious and thorough book, is careful to remind her reader that the only basis for reconstructing a more three-dimensional Simon Forman is the profusion of manuscripts, diaries and letters. Separating the tittle-tattle from the documented evidence, she excludes most of the salacious stories from her account. Basing her study squarely on Forman's papers, she conveys the inconsequential diversity of his writings, ranging from graphic notes on childbirth to inventories of expenses. Traister's Forman is an altogether less sensational character, and she goes some way towards persuading us that in spite of his absence of formal training, Forman did develop a respectable medical practice over the years, and that details of this can help us to understand the diversity of early modern medicine. </p> <p>The most interesting consequence of Traister's lively and readable account is that we discover a thoroughly eccentric type of late-16th-century intellectual who has built up his stock of usable knowledge entirely through his own resourcefulness. Like the autodidact miller in Carlo Ginzburg's classic The Cheese and the Worms , Forman builds an entire worldview grounded in herbal remedies, superstition, astrology and occult practices. These sustain him through a relatively successful and active life. This may be the eve of the scientific revolution, but an ordinary thinking man like Simon Forman still bases the crucial decisions that shape his life on dream-interpretation and fortune-telling, with the odd aphrodisiac potion thrown in.</p>",

Shakespeare scholars have long treasured Forman's diaries as rare first-hand records of visits to the London theatres, including details of performances of Macbeth , The Winter's Tale and Cymbeline . He was not, however, very good at remembering how the plot went - in his version it is Macbeth rather than his wife who attempts vainly to wash the imagined blood of Duncan from his hands. Yet Simon Forman has always been a footnote - an afterthought in other people's stories. The purpose of these new books is to retrieve the \"real man\" behind the anecdotes and innuendo, and to argue that Forman's professional life as a medical man and caster of horoscopes was more serious and interesting than hitherto believed. Judith Cook's is an avowedly popularising romp through Elizabethan England which constructs around the armature of Forman's writings a sentimental \"life and times\" recalling the film Shakespeare in Love - all street noise, colour and smells. Her strategy is to move surreptitiously from an entry in Forman's diary to events in London around that date - in none of which is there any evidence that Forman was involved. So an entry for 1599 telling us that he \"bought much harness and weapons for war, swords, daggers, muskets, corselets and furniture, staves, halberds\" becomes the occasion for a digression on the impending Essex rebellion, after which Cook remarks that he \"had more on his mind than Essex's expedition\" and returns to a colourful story of a paternity suit. Traister, in her far more serious and thorough book, is careful to remind her reader that the only basis for reconstructing a more three-dimensional Simon Forman is the profusion of manuscripts, diaries and letters. Separating the tittle-tattle from the documented evidence, she excludes most of the salacious stories from her account. Basing her study squarely on Forman's papers, she conveys the inconsequential diversity of his writings, ranging from graphic notes on childbirth to inventories of expenses. Traister's Forman is an altogether less sensational character, and she goes some way towards persuading us that in spite of his absence of formal training, Forman did develop a respectable medical practice over the years, and that details of this can help us to understand the diversity of early modern medicine. The most interesting consequence of Traister's lively and readable account is that we discover a thoroughly eccentric type of late-16th-century intellectual who has built up his stock of usable knowledge entirely through his own resourcefulness. Like the autodidact miller in Carlo Ginzburg's classic The Cheese and the Worms , Forman builds an entire worldview grounded in herbal remedies, superstition, astrology and occult practices. These sustain him through a relatively successful and active life. This may be the eve of the scientific revolution, but an ordinary thinking man like Simon Forman still bases the crucial decisions that shape his life on dream-interpretation and fortune-telling, with the odd aphrodisiac potion thrown in.",

      "body": "<p>What a pity for Vanessa Feltz that she wasn't a footballer. Then, in her bid to regain popularity, she wouldn't have needed to go through her recent detox diet and all its associated pain, the nausea, the acne, the halitosis. Because in football, there are few things the fans appreciate more than a tubby. Anyone who saw Neville Southall turn out for Bradford last season will remember how hugely he added to the occasion. </p> <p>Not that a player has to be in the Southall class to qualify as a footballing blimp. It may be a feminist issue off the pitch, but in football, fat is a relative term. Players like John Hartson and Paul Gascoigne, when encountered off the pitch would seem paragons of sleekness. But when up against the greyhound physique of the average player, where excess bloating is confined to the calves, they are deemed fat, their chunkier outline speaking of a hinterland of pies and lager. </p> <p>Dr Stephen Hawking, however, would be required to explain the degree of relativity which recently saw David Ginola branded stout. The last time any of us saw his torso, albeit enclosed in his grandad's cast-off vest, after he had removed his shirt in a goal celebration, vast swathes of the television audience swooned (and quite a few of them were women). The man is sculpted, there is more fat on a tree than on his washboard stomach. Yet, here was his manager, John Gregory, mocking him as a porker. </p> <p>Gregory clearly has a problem with Ginola. This week, the newly fat Frenchman was obliged not only to turn out for Aston Villa's reserve team in a game against Newcastle's stiffs, but to play as sweeper. As his infamous performance in France's 1993 World Cup qualifier against Bulgaria proved - when he gave away the ball in the final minute, and with it a goal and qualification - last line of defence is not his strength. True to form, on Wednesday night a misplaced backheel led directly to an opponent scoring. </p> <p>\"It was certainly not my idea,\" Ginola said after the game, which Villa lost 3-1. \"You'll have to ask other people.\" </p> <p>Gregory was swift to deny responsibility, suggesting the decision to humiliate Ginola in that position was taken by Villa's reserve team coach, Kevin MacDonald. Even so, the player would not need to have been on Paul Merson's old stimulant of choice to feel paranoid right now. </p> <p>Alex Ferguson, it is always said, needs an external enemy in order to motivate his troops. John Gregory prefers the Margaret Thatcher approach to man management, requiring instead an enemy within.

      "bodyText": "What a pity for Vanessa Feltz that she wasn't a footballer. Then, in her bid to regain popularity, she wouldn't have needed to go through her recent detox diet and all its associated pain, the nausea, the acne, the halitosis. Because in football, there are few things the fans appreciate more than a tubby. Anyone who saw Neville Southall turn out for Bradford last season will remember how hugely he added to the occasion. Not that a player has to be in the Southall class to qualify as a footballing blimp. It may be a feminist issue off the pitch, but in football, fat is a relative term. Players like John Hartson and Paul Gascoigne, when encountered off the pitch would seem paragons of sleekness. But when up against the greyhound physique of the average player, where excess bloating is confined to the calves, they are deemed fat, their chunkier outline speaking of a hinterland of pies and lager. Dr Stephen Hawking, however, would be required to explain the degree of relativity which recently saw David Ginola branded stout. The last time any of us saw his torso, albeit enclosed in his grandad's cast-off vest, after he had removed his shirt in a goal celebration, vast swathes of the television audience swooned (and quite a few of them were women). The man is sculpted, there is more fat on a tree than on his washboard stomach. Yet, here was his manager, John Gregory, mocking him as a porker. Gregory clearly has a problem with Ginola. This week, the newly fat Frenchman was obliged not only to turn out for Aston Villa's reserve team in a game against Newcastle's stiffs, but to play as sweeper. As his infamous performance in France's 1993 World Cup qualifier against Bulgaria proved - when he gave away the ball in the final minute, and with it a goal and qualification - last line of defence is not his strength. True to form, on Wednesday night a misplaced backheel led directly to an opponent scoring. \"It was certainly not my idea,\" Ginola said after the game, which Villa lost 3-1. \"You'll have to ask other people.\" Gregory was swift to deny responsibility, suggesting the decision to humiliate Ginola in that position was taken by Villa's reserve team coach, Kevin MacDonald. Even so, the player would not need to have been on Paul Merson's old stimulant of choice to feel paranoid right now. Alex Ferguson, it is always said, needs an external enemy in order to motivate his troops. John Gregory prefers the Margaret Thatcher approach to man management, requiring instead an enemy within. Remember Stan Collymore, who the manager mocked publicly for his depression? Now there is Ginola. Gregory's public hounding of the player - he doesn't try, doesn't contribute to the team, closes his eyes going up for headers, is a laughing stock among the crowd - began almost from the moment he arrived at Villa Park last summer. The latest complaint is about Ginola's attitude to being subbed during a recent game against Liverpool. \"He took his substitution quite calmly and that disappointed me,\" said Gregory, who clearly likes his players to react like Benito Carbone did in the FA Cup semi-final last season, by kicking over a drinks bucket and then marching to the dressing room up the wrong tunnel, only to emerge shamefaced a couple of minutes later. In many ways Ginola is an absurd character, with his hair, his modelling, his cod philosophising (\"I am Zen,\" he said, by way of explanation for his calmness at being subbed). But he was double player of the year only two seasons ago, and, as he showed for Villa against Manchester City, is still capable of disturbing the back of the opposition's net.

      "body": "<p>Nolberto Solano has plenty on his mind. There is Newcastle's unlikely yet dogged pursuit of a Uefa Cup place; his ongoing negotiations for a new four-year contract at St James' Park; not to mention the controversy over the Peruvian's Greek passport which could yet see him deported. </p> <p>He also has to try to arrange another trumpet lesson. \"I practise whenever I have time, but my teacher plays in the Newcastle Symphony Orchestra so it is hard to fix up,\" he grins, the words tumbling out of his mouth in broad Julio Geordio. \"I'm well into my salsa.\" </p> <p>Not that Solano will be blowing his own trumpet before tomorrow's trip to Charlton. The 26-year-old, signed from Boca Juniors in 1998, has limited his performances to the pitch after serenading his team-mates before a Worthington Cup tie with Birmingham in November. \"I played a bit for the lads with Gary Speed on guitar,\" he adds. \"It was difficult though; a clash of styles.\" The football followed suit with Newcastle losing 2-1. </p> <p>Bobby Robson's side visit the Valley hoping to lay a humiliating hoodoo to rest. Since goals from Temuri Ketsbaia and Jon-Dahl Tomasson beat Crystal Palace in December 1997, the Geordies have gone 23 matches without winning in the capital - a sequence that includes two FA Cup finals and a semi-final at Wembley. Leyton Orient of the Third Division held the Toon earlier this season, while the malaise has even spread to the juniors, who were knocked out of this year's FA Youth Cup by Palace. </p> <p>\"My experiences in London are not so good,\" said Solano, who has never returned with anything more than a few postcards to send back to Lima. \"I'm sure it's a lovely place, but we always come home with nothing. If we really want to reach the Uefa Cup then we need to win there eventually and this is our last chance this season.\" </p> <p>But against Charlton, Solano might be forgiven for having other matters on his mind. The Peruvian is one of 80 footballers currently under investigation by the Home Office over their eligibility to claim dual nationality. The midfielder was granted a work permit on his arrival in the north-east but allowed it to expire in 1999 having acquired a Greek passport, courtesy of a Greek grandmother. However, only a parent originating from Greece can confer dual nationality on their child. </p> <p>\"Don't mention your passport, Nobby,\" screams Warren Barton from the other side of the pitch. Solano complies but smiles in weary resignation. Newcastle's first-team squad fly to La Manga after tomorrow's match for a training week in the Spanish sun. With the furore continuing, his team-mates are unlikely to pass up a chance of some banter at passport control. </p> <p>Robson faces a catch 22 over his No15. Solano, a former national captain who made his Peru debut at 19, regularly returned jaded and leaden-footed from international duty last season. His manager, keen that his most inventive attacking force retains his sparkle, therefore welcomed the news that he had retired from playing for his country after a clash with Peru's coach Julio Cesar during a World Cup qualifier against Bolivia in October. Yet, should the Home Office rule that Solano does not qualify for dual nationality, he would have to play in 75% of his country's internationals to obtain a work permit. </p> <p>\"I need to talk to Cesar,\" said Solano. \"He was new to the job but I hardly spoke to him after the incident. We just had a difference of opinion. Maybe we can reach a solution and I'll be back playing for Peru. I know Newcastle wouldn't be happy because I would have to travel around the world, but it is my country.\" </p> <p>Solano's form this season has undoubtedly been international class. Linking up with Kieron Dyer on his inside - the pair share an almost telepathic relationship on the pitch, tearing down the right flank with canny interchanges and clever flicks - he remains the team's main goal supply line. He has sublime touch; against Leeds at Elland Road recently he gracefully controlled a crossfield pass and caressed the ball in one smooth motion to Shola Ameobi where others would have been happy merely to cushion the pass. The young striker scored and Newcastle won 3-1. </p> <p>\"I know I can play well here now,\" he said. \"In South America you have so much time on the ball, but here players are up and down the pitch, charging forward whenever they can. It's more physical; I'm surrounded by big guys (Solano stands 5'9\"). But I love it - the fighting spirit took time to adapt to, but you have to be strong. I have more confidence now. </p> <p>\"That is down to Mr Robson. He's a great manager, a wise old man who's been with England, Barcelona and Porto - all great teams. He has brought a bit of those clubs to Newcastle. This season we've had so many injuries, but he knows how to adapt to such situations, giving confidence to youngsters like Shola. He's so clever.\" </p> <p>While Robson's ability to maintain a European challenge with negligible funds and a crippling injury list has been astonishing, Solano has taken added responsibility on his shoulders. In seven glittering seasons with Sporting Cristal, Alianza Lima and Deportivo Municipal in Peru and Argentina's Boca he hit more than 50 goals. Robbed of his team's focal point - Alan Shearer returns to full training on Monday after a two-month absence - Solano has rediscovered that scoring touch. </p> <p>There have been six goals already, including a stunning volley against Aston Villa in the FA Cup, a delicate lob against the same opposition in the league and a blistering free-kick to help beat Leeds on Boxing Day. \"I look upon free-kicks in the same way as penalties,\" he says. \"When the games are so tight, you have to take your chance. If I miss I'm as disappointed as when I miss a penalty, but I don't mind that pressure. </p> <p>\"I learned a lot from Diego Maradona when we were together at Boca. He was very nice to me; an excellent man, a good man. I had seen him on the television at the 1986 and 1990 World Cups. </p> <p>\"Then, at my first training session with Boca, we were practising free-kicks and he told me: 'You are a master.' I said to him: 'In my country, we think you are the master.' He taught me when I should be looking to bend the ball over the wall, or trying to find one of my team-mates in the area.\" </p> <p>Maradona later christened Solano \"the little maestro\". Few on Tyneside would disagree.</p>",

Later Harold Needler, the Hull chairman and a lifelong supporter, settled \u00a3200,000 worth of shares in his quarry company on the club and from this base emerged a successful team with a ground to match. </p> <p>This week anyone old enough to remember the invigorating football played by the Hull side of Chris Chilton, Ken Houghton and Ken Wagstaff in the 60s will have felt a pang of anxiety at the thought of the Tigers going to the dogs. Fortunately, and despite the gloomiest prognostications, English football clubs are often at their most tenacious when clinging to existence. </p> <p>Hull supporters can console themselves with the thought that if Brighton can be carpetbagged, forced to play five motorways away at Gillingham and survive not only to return home, albeit not to the Goldstone Ground, to push for promotion then all things are possible. And it is not that long since Middlesbrough were locked out of Ayresome Park by the official receiver. </p> <p>Hull will carry on, there seems little doubt of that, and out of the present crisis may come the sort of renewed determination, from inside and outside the club, which saw Charlton Athletic reborn after several seasons of exile from the Valley. Nothing concentrates the minds of a football community so much as the possibility that its team will disappear. </p> <p>Yet with a transfer system which is the lifeblood of the Hulls, Hartlepools and Halifaxes about to disappear and uncertainties about the form of compensation that will take its place, this is a bad moment to be caught by the taxman. Football clubs owe each other money all the time but there are some creditors with whom it is never wise to dally. </p> <p>For Hull, settling the argument over a \u00a36,000 bill at Mr Chu's Chinese restaurant in the city would be a start. Surely even the Beckhams would not order that much chop suey.</p>",

And Hull were once typical of the well-run clubs forming a solid bedrock below the old First Division. In the late 40s, while United finished runners-up in the league with average gates of 46,000, Hull won promotion from the Third Division (North) with an average of 36,000. Later Harold Needler, the Hull chairman and a lifelong supporter, settled \u00a3200,000 worth of shares in his quarry company on the club and from this base emerged a successful team with a ground to match. This week anyone old enough to remember the invigorating football played by the Hull side of Chris Chilton, Ken Houghton and Ken Wagstaff in the 60s will have felt a pang of anxiety at the thought of the Tigers going to the dogs. Fortunately, and despite the gloomiest prognostications, English football clubs are often at their most tenacious when clinging to existence. Hull supporters can console themselves with the thought that if Brighton can be carpetbagged, forced to play five motorways away at Gillingham and survive not only to return home, albeit not to the Goldstone Ground, to push for promotion then all things are possible. And it is not that long since Middlesbrough were locked out of Ayresome Park by the official receiver. Hull will carry on, there seems little doubt of that, and out of the present crisis may come the sort of renewed determination, from inside and outside the club, which saw Charlton Athletic reborn after several seasons of exile from the Valley. Nothing concentrates the minds of a football community so much as the possibility that its team will disappear. Yet with a transfer system which is the lifeblood of the Hulls, Hartlepools and Halifaxes about to disappear and uncertainties about the form of compensation that will take its place, this is a bad moment to be caught by the taxman. Football clubs owe each other money all the time but there are some creditors with whom it is never wise to dally. For Hull, settling the argument over a \u00a36,000 bill at Mr Chu's Chinese restaurant in the city would be a start. Surely even the Beckhams would not order that much chop suey.",

Her lifelong friend, Clemmie, visits her daily, but consistently rounds down the amount of time that has already passed when Annie demands to know how long she has been there. Clemmie understands that Annie has undertaken one last grand project: to proceed once again through her unhappy life and to exorcise as many of its demons as she can; to seek and to bestow forgiveness; and to achieve, through catharsis, a smoother passage for her body and soul into eternity. </p> <p>Unfortunately for Annie, and for the verisimilitude of Rubens's complicated back story, her demons seem to be the principal figures in her life. Told in episodes that correspond to Annie's own determined hikes down memory lane, the book plunges us into a miserable and convoluted tale of treachery and abandonment. </p> <p>First, she is rudely deflowered by a departing GI in the back of an army truck and then, as a pregnant schoolgirl, ostracised by her tyrannical father and betrayed by her weak mother.

There are screaming matches and venomous allegations; the appearance of \"Milwaukee\" himself, an impostor chancing his arm in the family nest; accusations of rape, another baby of uncertain paternity and a private detective. Annie's life story seems set to end in inconclusion and loneliness. Attacked by mother and daughter, abandoned by her husband, she is accompanied only by her unshakable sense that she acted for the best in an unwinnable competition. </p> <p>Rubens's evocation of the onset of urgency amid the desperate longueurs of the hospice is so fine that it barely needs the frantic activity of the past to support it. One constantly itches to get back to the present: the small-scale deceptions of doctors, solicitors and friends as they simultaneously will their charges on to the end and collude to create an air of stability is drama enough. By contrast, the story of Annie's former life, riddled with casual brutality and disappointment, seems almost pedestrian. It is an obvious truth that characters in novels do not behave like real people, but the novelist must conceal that fundamental distortion. Here, one simply recoils in disbelief at the horrific inadequacy of the characters, each intent on creating their own, impregnable life story, and reacts with frustration at Annie's impotence to control her own. </p> <p>If it is true - or at least, a truly consoling prospect - that what remains of us is love, then Annie's delirium-fuelled hopes for a last reconciliation with her daughter seem to fall heart-breakingly short of the mark.

I don't go round head-butting walls in the dressing room or anything like that but I do psyche myself up mentally.\" </p> <p>Terry somehow managed to support both Chelsea and Manchester United as a boy and at one time trained at Old Trafford, travelling from east London to Manchester in the same car as David Beckham. Maybe that was a factor in him plumping for Chelsea as a 14-year-old, despite the fact that his dad and grandad are both United fans. </p> <p>Terry, who also had a spell with West Ham as a youngster, says: \"Although I was a fan of United's, when I was offered schoolboy forms on my 14th birthday, I made my decision as a potential professional footballer rather than a supporter. My dad was brilliant, not putting any pressure on me, and I decided that Chelsea were a better club, they just had a nice feel to them.\" </p> <p>At 6ft 1in and 12st 13lb of English manhood, Terry - the only homegrown talent now sure of a place in the Chelsea side - is built like old-fashioned former centre-halves at the club such as Micky Droy or Joe McLaughlin. But you do not get to split the World Cup-winning partnership of Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf simply by treading on people's toes and kicking a few opponents in the air. Nor by being the shy and retiring type on the pitch. </p> <p>Leboeuf, who seems likely to surrender his shirt to a fit-again Terry today, is at least satisfied that it is going to a deserving home, saying: \"He's a fantastic player. As well as being a great defender, he reads the game, which is very important because even if you are quick, if you are stupid, you arrive at the wrong time. He's got a good technique, too, so has everything to be a good defender. I told him two years ago he had to be patient because his time would come. Now I think it is coming.\" </p> <p>And Leboeuf, it seems, may be going, having already come close to joining Monaco. Although he has since pledged his loyalty to the club, one cannot imagine a man of Leboeuf's ego and sense of his own worth playing second fiddle to a 20-year-old for long. </p> <p>The sight of Terry playing in a reserve game against Coventry was the high spot of manager Claudio Ranieri's first day in London last September. He was so impressed that he later had a quiet word with the lad, letting him know that he was in his plans for the future. </p> <p>Terry, who played twice last season, says: \"People kept telling me to be patient and I was prepared to wait until I was 21 or 22 to get in the first team because Marcel and Frank are both World Cup winners and both world class.\" He did not, however, have to wait long, finding himself alongside Desailly in a Worthington Cup tie against Liverpool at Anfield in November when Leboeuf was suspended. </p> <p>By the following month, he was a regular, playing 10 successive games before flu caused him to miss the last two matches, though it is United's attackers who may catch a cold against him this afternoon. </p> <p>As Leboeuf points out, Terry is a well brought up young man with respect for his elders. He demonstrates this by praising the two French defenders for helping him with his game, sometimes simply by example. \"If you can take little bits from their game and add it to yours, you've got to be a better player,\" he says. </p> <p>Growing up he was convinced he would be conducting the midfield orchestra, his heroes were Bryan Robson, Paul Ince and Eric Cantona. According to Gwyn Williams, Chelsea's assistant manager, he arrived at the club as a midfield player who never made a tackle. But as his frame filled out and grew, he was asked to fill in as a defender for a youth match against Barnsley and never looked forward, so to speak. </p> <p>His dad and grandad will both be at Stamford Bridge today, though feeling rather sheepish about supporting Manchester United. Terry will have no feelings for United, not even hard ones about missing the chance to join a club that has enjoyed non-stop success since he turned them down. </p> <p>Nor will he and his Chelsea team-mates suffer any inferiority complex, especially not after the 5-0 hammering of United at Stamford Bridge last season. He says: \"Too many teams worry too much about the opposition and if you do that, you're going to lose.\" </p> <p>In any case, Chelsea's form at the Bridge has been good all season. It is only their appalling away form that has made their task of qualifying for the Champions League so difficult, though Terry says: \"I don't think that's a tall order if we can sort out our away form.\" Or to put it another way, if they can all starting singing from the same song sheet away from home.</p>",

Leboeuf, who seems likely to surrender his shirt to a fit-again Terry today, is at least satisfied that it is going to a deserving home, saying: \"He's a fantastic player. As well as being a great defender, he reads the game, which is very important because even if you are quick, if you are stupid, you arrive at the wrong time. He's got a good technique, too, so has everything to be a good defender. I told him two years ago he had to be patient because his time would come. Now I think it is coming.\" And Leboeuf, it seems, may be going, having already come close to joining Monaco. Although he has since pledged his loyalty to the club, one cannot imagine a man of Leboeuf's ego and sense of his own worth playing second fiddle to a 20-year-old for long. The sight of Terry playing in a reserve game against Coventry was the high spot of manager Claudio Ranieri's first day in London last September. He was so impressed that he later had a quiet word with the lad, letting him know that he was in his plans for the future. Terry, who played twice last season, says: \"People kept telling me to be patient and I was prepared to wait until I was 21 or 22 to get in the first team because Marcel and Frank are both World Cup winners and both world class.\" He did not, however, have to wait long, finding himself alongside Desailly in a Worthington Cup tie against Liverpool at Anfield in November when Leboeuf was suspended. By the following month, he was a regular, playing 10 successive games before flu caused him to miss the last two matches, though it is United's attackers who may catch a cold against him this afternoon. As Leboeuf points out, Terry is a well brought up young man with respect for his elders. He demonstrates this by praising the two French defenders for helping him with his game, sometimes simply by example. \"If you can take little bits from their game and add it to yours, you've got to be a better player,\" he says. Growing up he was convinced he would be conducting the midfield orchestra, his heroes were Bryan Robson, Paul Ince and Eric Cantona. According to Gwyn Williams, Chelsea's assistant manager, he arrived at the club as a midfield player who never made a tackle. But as his frame filled out and grew, he was asked to fill in as a defender for a youth match against Barnsley and never looked forward, so to speak. His dad and grandad will both be at Stamford Bridge today, though feeling rather sheepish about supporting Manchester United. Terry will have no feelings for United, not even hard ones about missing the chance to join a club that has enjoyed non-stop success since he turned them down. Nor will he and his Chelsea team-mates suffer any inferiority complex, especially not after the 5-0 hammering of United at Stamford Bridge last season. He says: \"Too many teams worry too much about the opposition and if you do that, you're going to lose.\" In any case, Chelsea's form at the Bridge has been good all season. It is only their appalling away form that has made their task of qualifying for the Champions League so difficult, though Terry says: \"I don't think that's a tall order if we can sort out our away form.\" Or to put it another way, if they can all starting singing from the same song sheet away from home.",

Mosley had been backing Allan Massie's The Sins of the Father , which none of the other judges favoured; indeed, not one of his choices had made the shortlist. Mosley, writing about the affair in the Times , commented that \"the other four judges complained that my chosen books were novels of ideas, or novels in which characters were subservient to ideas . . . My point was that humans were beings who did have ideas, who were often influenced by ideas, to whom ideas were important. If they were not, then there was some lack in being human.\" </p> <p>Mosley's novel Hopeful Monsters had been a success in 1990, when it won the Whitbread Prize. It is certainly a novel of ideas; Darwinism, Marxism, psychoanalysis and quantum physics are all kicked about, against backdrops of major 20th-century political events - the Spanish Civil War, Nazi Germany and so on. Two curious children, Max and Helena, are drawn together in a charming love story that also uses evolutionary theory as a metaphor for human and political possibility; \"hopeful monsters\" are genetic aberrations that turn out to be fortuitously equipped for subsequent changes of environment. </p> <p>Mosley's latest novel, The Hesperides Tree , has a less schematic yet even more implausible plot than its predecessor. An unnamed narrator, the soft-skulled offspring of a maker of scientific documentaries and a psychotherapist, goes on a trip to Ireland for his father's work. There he falls in love with a girl, Julie; stumbles upon some gun-running; learns about a bird colony on an offshore island where the birds seem to be evolving faster under environmental pressures than Darwinian science might allow for; and discovers also that in the Dark Ages, hermits settled on the same offshore island. On the dustjacket of the proof copy, a summary of the first part of the plot was followed by the despairing line \"He tries to imagine how these ways of life might be connected\", which is sensibly absent from the bound copy. </p> <p>Back in England, this heady brew is supplemented by the narrator's university switch from English literature to biology, his unlikely impregnation of a lesbian feminist, his friendship with a gay computer hacker (whose father once had an affair with the narrator's mother), the approaching millennium . . . But the plot - a series of contrived accidents and deliberately wild coincidences - is scarcely the point. The point is to assemble a cast of characters who can discuss political violence, evolutionary science, the internet, religion - the big ideas. They are scarcely credible, even as caricatures; their actions are frequently inexplicable and the dialogue stinks to high heaven, veering between banality and apparent telepathy. The narrator's mental health sometimes seems borderline, and he communicates in an idiot savant manner that makes his eerily fertile love life even less credible than it might have been. This is the literature of the genetically modified laboratory rat. </p> <p>When our narrator explains his decision to switch subjects from literature to science, there is a clue as to how Mosley has come to make such odd and unsuccessful stylistic choices in this book: \"literature seemed to treat humans no differently than science did; as characters predestined to behave in the way they did, very occasionally happening by chance to change, but with no awareness of autonomy. Their brains produced no more than a stream of consciousness or rather unconsciousness because they contained no feel of how humans might be creative. Thus literature became a chronicle of humanity's oddities and crimes and follies, peopled by characters with no virtue except that of being quaint. This was decked out indeed often enough in glorious or subtle language which gave the impression of empowerment; but there was little feel of this in the characters portrayed.\" </p> <p>This, of course, travesties literature: what it does, and what it can do. Half the faults diagnosed are made, in any case, by Mosley himself, apparently unwittingly. The difference is only that there is no linguistic glory or subtlety as his experiment plays out. Some of the ideas in this book are, indeed, important; the questions behind them certainly are. But Mosley fails to establish the importance of playing out those questions and ideas in a novel and, dismayingly, fails to write a satisfying novel in which to entertain them. I loved Hopeful Monsters ; it was one of my favourite novels of the early 1990s, and deserved the Whitbread Prize. The Hesperides Tree is easily one of the worst novels I have read in the last 10 years, and pages 77 to 79 would merit the Bad Sex Award.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Last year Woody Allen made a movie about a small-time crook who opens an upscale cookie store next to a bank so that he and his henchmen can burrow inside. The tunnelling operation is a disaster, but the cookie business is such a hit that he and his wife can retire from the malfeasance racket for good. On the surface, this seemed like a can't-miss premise. But Small Time Crooks turned out to be one of Allen's least successful movies for the pure and simple reason that he forgot to write any good jokes.</p> <p>Though hardly a disaster, David Mamet's State And Main falls into the same general category. The movie's premise is not unpromising: a motion picture crew turn up in a small, picture-perfect town in rural Vermont and announce that they are there to make a heartwarming film about redemption. The movie people are the usual calculating egomaniacs from Los Angeles, and the rustics are the usual clueless rustics. In theory, the cultural collision between the ostensibly good (ordinary people) and the indisputably evil (the movie crew) should translate into tons of chuckles and everyone should go home with a spring in their step and a song in their heart.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Mamet forgot to write the jokes. The result is a charming, generally amusing, refreshingly intelligent movie, definitely a worthwhile rental on a depressing late summer afternoon. But unlike Shadow Of The Vampire, which is also a humorous movie about the making of a movie, State And Main never achieves lift-off.

      "bodyText": "Last year Woody Allen made a movie about a small-time crook who opens an upscale cookie store next to a bank so that he and his henchmen can burrow inside. The tunnelling operation is a disaster, but the cookie business is such a hit that he and his wife can retire from the malfeasance racket for good. On the surface, this seemed like a can't-miss premise. But Small Time Crooks turned out to be one of Allen's least successful movies for the pure and simple reason that he forgot to write any good jokes. Though hardly a disaster, David Mamet's State And Main falls into the same general category. The movie's premise is not unpromising: a motion picture crew turn up in a small, picture-perfect town in rural Vermont and announce that they are there to make a heartwarming film about redemption. The movie people are the usual calculating egomaniacs from Los Angeles, and the rustics are the usual clueless rustics. In theory, the cultural collision between the ostensibly good (ordinary people) and the indisputably evil (the movie crew) should translate into tons of chuckles and everyone should go home with a spring in their step and a song in their heart. Unfortunately, Mamet forgot to write the jokes. The result is a charming, generally amusing, refreshingly intelligent movie, definitely a worthwhile rental on a depressing late summer afternoon. But unlike Shadow Of The Vampire, which is also a humorous movie about the making of a movie, State And Main never achieves lift-off. It just sort of lies there. The story runs as follows: a film crew headed by the reliably deranged William H Macy have fled from their previous shooting locale because of an unspecified contretemps. They now descend upon Waterford, Vermont, which suits their needs because it is quaint and has an old mill, and because the name of their quaint film is The Old Mill. Initially, the townspeople are happy to see them; initially, townspeople always are. Then problems start. The nervous, goofy screenwriter (Philip Seymour Hoffman) falls in love with the eccentric bookstore owner (Rebecca Pidgeon), who is also director of the local theatre group. The theatre group falls apart because the locals would rather be non-speaking extras in a real, live motion picture than bit players in some crummy local production of Hamlet or Pal Joey. After the male lead (Alec Baldwin) despoils the finest jailbait in the tri-state area (Julia Stiles), Pidgeon's jilted fianc\u00e9, a small-time politician, decides to shake down the film producer (David Paymer) for money. Meanwhile, the bimbo female lead (Sarah Jessica Parker) wants an extra $800,000 to reveal her breasts on camera; this seems a bit pricey.

      "body": "<p>Composers who felt unappreciated in their own lifetime invariably consoled themselves with the conviction that their time would eventually come, even if they did not live to see it. Bruckner, though at times tormented by self-doubt, cherished a deep conviction that his music would survive him. He has been proved right. Yet the same criticisms that dogged him in life - his orchestration was poor, his structures too rigid - are still voiced, and many conductors prefer those versions of his symphonies that were \"improved\" by his pupils over Bruckner's originals. </p> <p>By choosing the 1890 version of the Third Symphony - the one most altered by Bruckner's pupils - Skrowaczewski (who made a few alterations of his own to the orchestration) went for the streamlined option. In many ways, this was welcome: conductors who emphasise the block-like textures and form risk sounding four-square and losing momentum. Skrowaczewski was never in danger of that; in fact, parts of the scherzo in particular didn't sound like Bruckner at all. The gentle Austrian dances that punctuate its opening whirlwind theme were brilliantly infused with the colours and inflections that Mahler was later to painstakingly notate. </p> <p>The pros and cons of interpreting music \"backwards\" in this way are legion, but on this occasion it was a revelation. Every change of tone was imaginatively characterised; the finale's slow polka almost grotesquely inflected, sounding as it if was rising from a vault rather than from a party. The Hall\u00e9 played magnificently, with principal flautist Andrew Nicholson on especially fine form. </p> <p>Chantal Juillet's crystalline sound is ideally suited to the luminous textures and enchanted moods of Szymanowski's First Violin Concerto. Weaving its way through the sumptious orchestral texture like silver thread, her high tessitura was exquisitely rounded with an intense vibrato, each note swelling like a raindrop but never breaking. Skrowaczewski and the Hall\u00e9 were sensitive partners in a delicately coloured and nuanced performance. </p> <p>A slight disappointment came in Wagner's Tannhauser overture, where the mellow but sometimes weak Hall\u00e9 strings were overwhelmed by full-bodied brass and bass sections. Perhaps placing the double basses behind the wind and brass contributed to a booming sound; this mattered most towards the end, where a more robust string sound was badly needed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Composers who felt unappreciated in their own lifetime invariably consoled themselves with the conviction that their time would eventually come, even if they did not live to see it. Bruckner, though at times tormented by self-doubt, cherished a deep conviction that his music would survive him. He has been proved right. Yet the same criticisms that dogged him in life - his orchestration was poor, his structures too rigid - are still voiced, and many conductors prefer those versions of his symphonies that were \"improved\" by his pupils over Bruckner's originals. By choosing the 1890 version of the Third Symphony - the one most altered by Bruckner's pupils - Skrowaczewski (who made a few alterations of his own to the orchestration) went for the streamlined option. In many ways, this was welcome: conductors who emphasise the block-like textures and form risk sounding four-square and losing momentum. Skrowaczewski was never in danger of that; in fact, parts of the scherzo in particular didn't sound like Bruckner at all. The gentle Austrian dances that punctuate its opening whirlwind theme were brilliantly infused with the colours and inflections that Mahler was later to painstakingly notate. The pros and cons of interpreting music \"backwards\" in this way are legion, but on this occasion it was a revelation. Every change of tone was imaginatively characterised; the finale's slow polka almost grotesquely inflected, sounding as it if was rising from a vault rather than from a party. The Hall\u00e9 played magnificently, with principal flautist Andrew Nicholson on especially fine form. Chantal Juillet's crystalline sound is ideally suited to the luminous textures and enchanted moods of Szymanowski's First Violin Concerto. Weaving its way through the sumptious orchestral texture like silver thread, her high tessitura was exquisitely rounded with an intense vibrato, each note swelling like a raindrop but never breaking. Skrowaczewski and the Hall\u00e9 were sensitive partners in a delicately coloured and nuanced performance. A slight disappointment came in Wagner's Tannhauser overture, where the mellow but sometimes weak Hall\u00e9 strings were overwhelmed by full-bodied brass and bass sections. Perhaps placing the double basses behind the wind and brass contributed to a booming sound; this mattered most towards the end, where a more robust string sound was badly needed.",

He is running late, due to a two-hour delay to yesterday morning's flight from his home in Yorkshire . </p> <p>Not that the minor irritation of a late flight or the major headache of a \u00a31bn acquisition that GE Capital tried to spoil was likely to slow him down. \"The organisation can move no faster than the people at the top.

One allegation against Equitable was that its actuaries got their sums wrong and left it with a potential \u00a31.5bn hole - something which the Halifax deal addresses by enabling Equitable to mount a scheme limiting the billion-pound bill to honour guaranteed annuities. Of course, the policyholders still have to agree. </p> <p>\"It gives them the opportunity to vote for a scheme that puts the fund on a new financial footing. It's a big prize,\" he says, convinced that Equitable will muster the support it needs from policyholders, some of whom accuse Equitable of acting too quickly in accepting Halifax and want others bidders to be considered again - although they admit that is now unlikely. </p> <p>As a student of maths, Crosby believes logical arguments will win over the policyholders who pointed at Halifax's share price rise last week as evidence that the bank is getting a good deal. Yesterday the shares were still stuck below the 774p at which they made their debut when the Halifax building society floated four years ago, but at 713p they were well above the 410p they sank to this time last year. </p> <p>Crosby wants to boost Halifax's shares by persuading the City that it is more than just mortgages - a market that is facing fierce competition and where Halifax is historically the biggest lender. He aims to set Halifax apart as a champion of the consumer, hence the decision to set Howard Brown, the fish-carrying bank cashier, on to an unsuspecting national TV audience to try to lure customers for its 4% interest-bearing current account. </p> <p>Brown is now something of a celebrity, and Crosby recounts a tale where the winner of the internal talent competition received a standing ovation at a recent sales conference and was besieged by colleagues seeking his autograph and ignoring their chief executive. \"I can't sing,\" Crosby chortles when asked why he is not fronting the campaign in the way Sir Peter Davis did when running the Prudential. </p> <p>Crosby, despite his Yorkshire roots, is not blunt enough to say what he really thinks about the \"big four\" - Lloyds TSB, HSBC, NatWest and Barclays - with their more than 70% share of the current account market. He refuses to say they rip off their customers with their 0.1% rate. </p> <p>Instead, he says: \"It makes no sense in today's world for the clearing banks to offer 0.1%. That is a complete anachronism, and it is basically saying to the customers we'll give you 0.1% because you won't leave. It doesn't make any sense compared to any other financial product.\" </p> <p>The ad campaign has prompted people to go into Halifax branches and ask for a \"Howard account\". Refusing to be precise about how many new accounts the bank has added to its 2m share of the 30m account current market before the bank's profits announcement in a fortnight, he admits to being \"OK\" with progress so far. </p> <p>Now two years into the job, Crosby was virtually unknown to the City when he took the helm after the sudden departure of Mike Blackburn. This is despite the fact that the fast-talking sports enthusiast had been instrumental Halifax's acquisition of Clerical Medical just before the building society floated on the stock market. </p> <p>There is no sign that he would ever encourage Halifax to move its head office from the eponymous Yorkshire town. He admits to holding a long-standing prejudice against living and working in London, instead chosing Ilkley, where he lives with his wife Una and four daughters - one of whom he delivered - aged 10, eight, six and two. </p> <p>The Equitable deal - which his wife has banned him from mentioning - is part of the diversification strategy away from Halifax's traditional market, in which it has a share of 20% that every financial institution wants to steal. The upmarket insurance business, St James's Place, as well as the \"right here, right now\" Intelligent Finance and the signing up of Peter Wood, the Direct Line multimillionaire, to create an online insurance operation, are also part of this diversification drive. Crosby admits the launching of Intelligent Finance provided both his highs and lows last year but he is not one to dwell on mistakes - an early lesson in his career when he was a fund manager at Scottish Amicable in Glasgow, in the early 1980s. </p> <p>\"The ability to say, 'hey, that was wrong' and move on to the next game quickly, rather than get involved in bureaucratic processes where everybody says 'it wasn't my fault' - you learn that from fund management,\" he says. </p> <p><strong> Persuasion</strong><br> </p> <p> Yet, even though Halifax's traditional market is under siege from competitors, Crosby refuses to give up on it.

The second movement of the Third Quartet was a volatile scherzo, expertly versed in the extended harmonic palettes of Ravel and Debussy. The finale began as a quiet procession of diatonic chords, which eventually flowered into a lively unison passage. Finally, the piece returned to the translucent textures of the opening movement, as Jack integrated this static, reflective music within an organic argument. Yet for all Jack's compositional elegance, this quartet told an old, even hackneyed, story. </p> <p>The three movements of the Fourth Quartet were still more conventional. Jack's slow movement created a subtle drama of continuity and interruption, as a series of gently rocking chords were fragmented into faltering, staccato phrases. However, there was nothing fresh or startling about this music, and the Ardittis' performances of all of Jack's quartets were uncharacteristically remote and uninvolving. Even the celebratory 08.02.01 was more enervating than exciting. </p> <p>The title of Jack's 08.02.01 may have been a reference to Janacek's Piano Sonata 1.X.1905, one of the most famous pieces to be named after a date. But Janacek's two string quartets inhabit a totally different expressive world from Jack's. The Ardittis' account of Janacek's First String Quartet was full of their typical energy and elan, but this was a curiously unfocused performance. </p> <p>However, the performance of Janacek's Second String Quartet which concluded the concert was brilliantly intense. In the codas to the first and fourth movements, Janacek seems to write against the grain of the instruments, producing sounds and raw noises of extraordinary force.

Gee has found his soulmate in Clifford: the powerful-looking percussionist has an understated delicacy that perfectly propels these thoughtful and finely wrought compositions. He effortlessly throws subtle samba grooves into the stew, plays his solos with the tips of his fingers and occasionally sings along in a quietly keening falsetto. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Whitehead confidently navigates the emotional labyrinth of Gee's musical creations, blowing from side to side with his eyes closed, set afloat by the swinging buoyancy of Steve Rose's bass. </p> <p>Gee's compositions are unfailingly melodic, packed with riffs, motifs and tune fragments that could all form the basis for some attractive and inventive pop songs. As a pianist he evokes the spirits of Herbie Hancock, Claude Debussy and Bill Evans, carefully balancing a light-footed funkiness with a sensuous enjoyment of colour and dynamics. Even when he is tempted to play a million notes per second the effect is curiously meditative, and the rhythmic unpredictability of his playing never interferes with the groove. </p> <p>The group are at their most powerful when playing incredibly softly, tiptoeing through an intricate series of stops and starts, carefully making their mark in space with a quietly glowing intensity. At one point they evoke the softly shimmering melancholia of times gone by so effectively that they stand stock still with expressions of regret on their faces, as if contemplating all that they have ever loved and lost. </p> <p>In many ways it's a shame that Gee chooses to work in such a traditional jazz quartet format. His music is endlessly inventive, harmonically and rhythmically, and although it is being played by superb musicians you can imagine it arranged for a more unusual line-up. Could he not perhaps take a leaf from Django Bates's book and hire a string quartet, a couple of samplers and a beautiful female vocalist? He would get a bigger audience.</p>",

His music is endlessly inventive, harmonically and rhythmically, and although it is being played by superb musicians you can imagine it arranged for a more unusual line-up. Could he not perhaps take a leaf from Django Bates's book and hire a string quartet, a couple of samplers and a beautiful female vocalist? He would get a bigger audience.",

Anthony Hopkins stalks our screens as Hannibal the cannibal, but no one thinks the actor really eats humans for supper. Yet in pop there is an identification of the singer with the song. There is nothing to suggest Eminem's murderous, misogynist characters such as Slim Shady are any more real than Hammer horror or Sir Cliff's satanic Devil Woman. </p> <p>Eminem (aka Marshall Mathers) is primarily a fantasist, pop's own Stephen King, producing art that is repellent but compelling. His use of words such as \"bitch\" and \"faggot\" is unfortunate, but in US hip-hop these are put-downs, with less inflammatory ramifications than here. Eminem appears as bemused by the fuss as his fans, from all ages, colours and genders, who are actually civil, but enjoy the thrill of music that gets outsiders hot under the collar. </p> <p>Sixteen thousand of them give the thumbs-up to a show rooted in cinematic horror. Eminem - as Slim - recreates the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (in accordance with officialdom, the saw is not plugged in) and appears in an electric chair. Much of the rest is a standard rap show. The contentious lyrics are often inaudible. On record Eminem comes across as a genuinely anti-social nihilist, but live he is a good old-fashioned crowd-pleaser. </p> <p>Of course, few escape his cartoon rage - from his mum to the thousands of \"bitches\" in the audience who cheer his homicidal threats. It helps that the bad boy is very cute. At one point, he gets the entire audience to shout that they're \"drug addicts\". Really? Noticeably, he draws the line at racism. As a white rapper who has fought hard for the respect of the rap community, he places his instinct for self-preservation above that for shock. </p> <p>On record, Eminem is a master of complex psychological games. His detractors have not noticed that his glorious hit Stan explores unrequited male to male adoration\". </p> <p>The vaunted homophobia? One of Eminem's rappers wields a rubber phallus, but it is more pantomime than sinister. A more dicey moment is when Eminem mentions the weapons charges facing him in the US, but it becomes just a way of introducing his tune Criminal.

The musing, childless Foley is poisoned by the legacy of his great-great-grandfather, who shot a Catholic peasant robbing his orchard. Even Foley's irascible gentleman-farmer father routinely refers to Catholics as \"poachers\". </p> <p>Foley, played by Andrew Bennett, stands alone in life, abandoned by his wife and remembering his childhood in a family whose impeccable manners sheathed an unconscionable rudeness. To spite them, he married a Catholic and converted - as he says, \"about the most Protestant thing I ever did in my life\". </p> <p>With visionary theatrical shorthand, Bennett distractedly evokes the menagerie of the family: doting aunt Hilda constantly asking for her dead pug-dog; a snot-lisping cousin; the questionable child's memory of his parents icily bonking on the kitchen table. </p> <p>West's purple prose is far from ideal for the stage, but Bennett carries you along with his measured, basso profundo delivery. His often distasteful, provocative playing delivers irresistible stabs of humour, both high and low, such as the caricature of the hapless Irish cook, forever having an accident with the potatoes. </p> <p>Bennett's intensity also coughs up some nicely unmoored gems of pathos, such as the Equus-like bareback horse ride across the benighted fields; or the death at 13 of his life-enhancing sister, Beah, from heart failure - as though she were some fragile thing, ill-equipped to survive in the airless \"big house\". </p> <p>Such moments are heightened by Vincent Doherty's live, delicate piano, and Annie Ryan's momentarily stylised direction. Even so, West's play often seems better suited for radio, or even the page. His self-conscious fussing with language, and contradictory, metafictional touches, are extremely distracting, and Foley seems to invent his memories as he goes along, causing you to doubt the veracity of anything he says. </p> <p>All that aside, this is a strangely affecting 75-minute piece. Crucially, it hinges on Bennett's performance - all the way to Foley's unreliable vision of the past. </p> <p>\u0095 Ends tonight. Box office: 00-353-1-4627477. Then tours.</p>",
