Harry Harris is also reported to have called Sportspages, the well-known bookshop, asking it to withdraw the book from its shelves.

Tottenham's letters to Harris, which are all published in the book, also give an insight into the way some of the country's leading clubs treat their paying customers. </p> <p>Harris's first letter to Sugar, in August 1996, raised issues such as the future of Spurs, the effects of the Bosman ruling, plans to sign players and even Bruce Rioch's recent sacking from Arsenal. \"I was getting very frustrated,\" he recalls. \"I just needed some answers. I really couldn't figure out the direction Sugar wanted to take the club.\" </p> <p>The reply, when it came a few days later from Tottenham's then chief executive Claude Littner, was hardly enlightening and somewhat contemptuous, given that Harris is a season-ticket holder and lifelong supporter. </p> <p>Littner informed Harris in the last paragraph: \"Your analyses of football... are not in line with our view and your interpretation of Bosman may not work out that way. Similarly your analysis of, and regard for, Bruce Rioch are based on... well nothing - a bit like the rest of your letter.\" </p> <p>It was a red rag to a bull. For Harris the club's off-hand response would prove to be the start of an obsessive, detailed and persistent letter-writing campaign to Sugar in which he sought to find answers to the team's demise during one of the most troublesome periods in its history. </p> <p>Prior to the start of the 1996-97 season Spurs - then managed by Gerry Francis - had sold J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, the Romanian pair Gica Popescu and Ilie Dumitrescu, and Nick Barmby, replacing them with Ruel Fox, Chris Armstrong, Clive Wilson and Andy Sinton. Steven Harris wanted to know what was going on at his beloved club and admits he became obsessed with firing off letters to Sugar about the decline of his team. </p> <p>Harris never once received a reply from Harry Harris while Tottenham irregularly replied but that did not put him off from writing more and more inquiring letters, and the anorak extraordinaire did not stop at team issues. </p> <p>He also wrote letters to Sugar about ticket allocation for an away match against Chelsea, and the location of the seat allocated to the club's former manager Bill Nicholson's seat for last season's Worthington Cup final. </p> <p>The former Spurs striker Teddy Sheringham was also sent a letter, asking him why he left the club. He never replied. Says Harris: \"The letters took up quite a lot of my time.

My friends have been very patient with me and some of them did think it was a bit strange, that I was becoming a bit obsessive. I have been the butt of a lot of jokes but I couldn't stop writing letters because I wanted answers to what was happening at Tottenham.\" </p> <p>Spurs fans will, of course, empathise with Harris's frustration, and the book also provides a painful summary of the upheavals at the club over the past few years. </p> <p>As for Harris, he is enduring another unhappy Tottenham season, and is preparing to express his anger - by letter, of course.</p>",

      "body": "<p>David Busst is so matter of fact describing the 17th, and last, operation that has finally allowed him to kick a ball again that he could be a mechanic explaining how he has changed the spark plugs in your car and tightened up the fan belt. </p> <p>Busst, the former Coventry defender who is now managing Solihull Borough, had 15 operations in 12 months following the leg break at Old Trafford four years ago that was so horrific it sent the then Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel into counselling. </p> <p>There were operations to put pins in, operations to take them out, skin grafts, muscle flaps. But it was an operation in May 1998 that restored his ability to kick with his right foot and got his hopes of re turning to football as a coach up and running, so to speak. </p> <p>\"It wasn't the break that stopped me playing\", he explains, \"but the damage to all my tendons and a dropped foot. So the last operation I had was a tendon transfer, where they move all the tendons about and tighten them up.\" </p> <p>He still walks with a limp and cannot raise his foot above the horizontal but it is now held in a firm position, a little like the head of a golf club. \"The only thing I can't do is chip a ball,\" he says, \"but then I never could.\" </p> <p>It is impossible to prevent your teeth grinding as you recall the details of the career-ending injury on April 8, 1996 - Busst's leg bent back at a 90-degree angle after a challenge for the ball following a corner; the game held up for almost 10 minutes as they mopped up his blood; and Busst in so much pain as he was carried off that \"I couldn't hear 50,000 fans applauding me above the noise of my own screams\". Schmeichel was so affected that he had a brief spell of counselling to get over it. </p> <p>Busst was 28 then. Now 32, he has seen the inside of more hospitals and clinics than Elizabeth Taylor. But he never once contemplated the Priory clinic because he is not, he says, a man given to depression. In any case, the hundreds of interviews he gave in the months after leaving hospital proved more therapeutic than years of counselling. </p> <p>He says: \"I never had any media attention as a player. But for six months after the injury, I was on Sky Sports, down to London all the time to do TV and radio, and every paper was phoning for interviews. Only when it all stopped and no one was interested any more did I think, 'Oh God, that's it now.' \" </p> <p>The thought he found most difficult to cope with was not the loss of his playing career and the likelihood he would not be able to coach, but that he would not be able to kick a ball in the garden or on the beach with his children, Leah, 13, and three-year-old Cobi. </p> <p>Thanks to that final operation, Leah and Cobi have a fully functioning daddy and Coventry have a popular assistant community officer who organises after-school coaching sessions for local kids and sets up half-term courses. He is also the newly appointed manager of Solihull Borough in the Dr Martens League Western Division, one of his former clubs. </p> <p>Busst was coaching their under-18s as part of his practical for the Uefa A badge when he was asked to take over from the sacked Paul Dyson a month ago. He has since steered the team to four successive wins, including a Worcester Cup success against the Dr Martens Premier Division side Redditch in midweek. </p> <p>That encounter, like today's league match against the runaway leaders Moor Green, the club from whom Coventry signed him, is both a home and away match. Solihull flogged their ground 10 years ago and have since been sharing with Redditch and Moor Green. Next season, however, they will move into a new, 3,000-seat stadium, which should improve attendances that are currently under 200. </p> <p>Having had only four years and 50 games in the Premiership, after signing for Coventry at 24, Busst empathises more closely with the non-league player. He says: \"I appreciate where these lads are coming from. I know what it's like to come to Monday night training feeling exhausted after a full day's work, particularly the ones who work in the building trade. The last thing they need is me shouting at them, which can only make them ask, 'Why am I doing this?' \" </p> <p>He has found himself doing a bit of a Gordon Strachan on the touchline, but he is trying to curb that, too. \"You can't really change things and I remember when managers used to bawl at me and you'd pretend you couldn't hear. Shouting can have a positive effect but it can have a negative one, making a player scared to even want the ball.\" </p> <p>Solihull, he says, are a family club that extended to full-blown nepotism when he appointed his dad John, former manager of Evesham, as scout. Premiership stars would cringe at the players' workload - if they are successful in the league and the four cups, they can play 60 games a season. And most of them also turn out for Sunday morning teams. </p> <p>Busst, who hopes to get his A badge this summer, has no long-term plans. Having never considered management before it was thrust upon him, he is just seeing whether he likes it. And he is literally happy just to be alive - and kicking.</p>",

Meanwhile, Danny Wilson's season took another turn for the worse yesterday when, in a Belgian newspaper interview, Sheffield Wednesday's striker Gilles de Bilde was quoted as heavily criticising his team-mates, their style of play and the English game in general. \"People say how brilliant it is, but it's only the foreign players who make the difference,\" said the Belgian. \"Manchester United are the only exception. In all the other teams the strikers and attacking midfielders all come from abroad, especially at Wednesday. \"All the good balls are from Wim Jonk. He gives you passes to feet; passes from the other players go over your head. The players just give it a long kick and it is up to me and Gerald Sibon to do something about it.\"",

By casting the blame on Aston Villa - I did my best but they consistently let me down was the gist of his remarks - Collymore came across as unrepentant and self-pitying. Moreover, for students of his sad decline, there was a familiar pattern to his remarks. As his former manager Frank Clark puts it, for Stan the grass is always greener on the other side. </p> <p>When the player first arrived at Nottingham Forest he announced he was glad to be out of Southend; when he then transferred to Liverpool he belittled Forest; when he arrived at Villa Park he told everyone he was glad to be home. Two and a half years later his time in Birmingham is dismissed as a \"nightmare\". </p> <p>Great actors do not blame the theatre in which they were performing for their flops or, as Paul Merson put it this week: \"It might be a new club but it's the same you.\" </p> <p>And the welcome Collymore receives at his new place of work will depend, as Steve Walsh explained, not on his potential but on his performances. On the surface Leicester is the last place a player like him will find conducive. It is a dressing-room forged on a one-for-all, all-for-one philosophy, it is a dressing- room without stars, it is a dressing- room, one suspects, that is ruthless in weeding out those who do not share a commitment to the cause. Tea and sympathy will be in short supply. </p> <p>So why did a manager as shrewd as Martin O'Neill buy him? Well, for a start, he is desperate. Leicester have a shortage of strikers and Collymore is potentially a class act. He has everything physically required to be the greatest and might just score a few goals. If he doesn't, well, thanks to John Gregory's desperation to be rid of him, O'Neill is not taking any financial risk; if it all goes pear-shaped, Collymore can be on his way with limited damage to Leicester's bottom line. </p> <p>Then there is the Cantona factor. Barry Fry, one of Collymore's small army of previous managers, alluded to the Frenchman when he suggested that O'Neill might have the bargain of the century on his hands. Cantona, after all, had a reputation as shot as Collymore's when he arrived at Old Trafford and look what he achieved there. Yet Cantona's problems were caused by a surfeit, rather than a lack, of commitment, which manifested itself as a volcanic temper. If anything, he took the game too seriously. It was not until he met up with someone as dedicated to the cause as him that it all clicked. </p> <p>Nevertheless, as O'Neill has gambled, it might just work for Collymore this time. But it will work only if he has changed, if he is determined to achieve something with his talent before it is too late, if he is ready to resist the temptation to retreat the moment anything goes wrong. Because football won't change to meet him halfway. Dressing-rooms will remain places which treat the unorthodox brutally. Footballers will continue to live under a code of collective responsibility; whingeing, skiving, aloofness will not be tolerated. It may be neanderthal but it is a fact of team games: players need to be able to rely on their team-mates. </p> <p>Which is probably Collymore's tragedy. In retrospect his undoubted physical prowess would have been better used in a sport that suited his mental proclivities, an individual pursuit like sprinting. It is too late for that now. And, if he excuses away this opportunity with Leicester, it will be too late also for Stan Collymore to become the footballer he might have been. </p> <p><strong>Curcic has a great deal on his mind</strong></p> <p>It is heartening to discover a footballer whose priorities go beyond the financial. Sasa Curcic, the former Bolton, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace midfielder, whose last appearance in Britain was carrying a placard round Selhurst Park asking Nato to stop bombing his Yugoslav homeland, has more pressing needs. </p> <p>\"Some chairman might have to pay \u00a310m for me but I would not want that. But if they offered me 15 women from around the world, then I might play.\" </p> <p>Curcic adds that he has \"given up football for sex\". Dwight Yorke is said to be in shock at the revelation that the two pursuits are, apparently, mutually exclusive. </p> <p><strong>The prickling of Celtic that gives hope to thistles everywhere</strong></p> <p>The reaction to Celtic's defeat by Inverness Caledonian Thistle was extraordinary this week: John Barnes hustled out of his job, Kenny Dalglish furious that he is obliged to abandon the golf course and do some work, the Sun praised by the Independent for producing a literary masterpiece of a headline (\"Super Caley Go Ballistic Celtic Are Atrocious\"). </p> <p>But the most intriguing aspect of the affair was the way in which Scottish football fans with no particular brief for either side were so enthused by the result. It was not just in Inverness (and in the blue half of Glasgow) that they were dancing in the streets. The grins were evident everywhere on Wednesday morning - everywhere, that is, except in the environs of Celtic Park. </p> <p>The reason was not just the inevitable pleasure that comes from seeing the mighty fall from a roof. It was also because such is the growing domination of the Old Firm that nobody thought such a result would ever happen again. Everyone simply assumed that the increasing concentration of wealth in the coffers of the big two would ensure that the Glasgow clubs would continue to hoover up all the trophies until such time as they decided to take their ball with them and go off and play in an Atlantic League. </p> <p>Of course, with Celtic in the semi-finals of the League Cup and with Rangers still in the Scottish Cup (and with a space already allocated for the Premier League trophy in the Ibrox boardroom display cabinet), it is likely that the hegemony will be intact again at the end of the season.

The dust, disturbance and immediate damage caused by the quarrying could destroy or drive away some of the mountain's rare species. The government has previously sought to restrict access to Tindaya, in order to protect the Guanches' carvings. It could not justify the project without encouraging thousands of people to visit it. Land speculators have moved in already, buying up the endangered scrubland on and around the mountain in the hope that it will become valuable building land once the sculpture has been completed. The government has commissioned neither environmental nor archaeological assessments of its plan. </p> <p> But the volcanic porphyry from which the mountain is made is in great demand. It is of a particularly beautiful variety, much sought after for facing prestigious buildings. Its value has risen significantly over the past few years. The \"sculpture\" is, in other words, a brilliant and audacious scam. Government officials have spotted in Chillida's grandiose dreams the means of realising their own. </p> <p>This is not to suggest that Chillida himself is party to this artful dodge. He is just a vain old man who wants to build a monument that will be impossible to ignore: his egocentricity is being exploited by people who have recognised a perfect convergence of interests. But despite numerous attempts by the islanders opposed to the project to tell him what he is putting his name to, Chillida refuses to acknowledge the problems. He appears to believe that his sculpture is a matter of destiny. </p> <p>\"I went up and found those footprints left by the Guanches and it turned out that they are identical to my signature, but with a few more fingers,\" he recalls. \"Strange, no?\" </p> <p>The opponents of his scheme are, he says, making a fuss about nothing. \"I only want to create something for man, a great space where we would feel smaller than we think we are, and more tolerant to one another, a place of tolerance: marvellous.\" </p> <p>The problem is that if this project goes ahead, the tolerance it will commemorate will be the tolerance of corruption.

Our Scottish instructor could not wait to get started. These sorts of days only happen a handful of times in a season, he told us. </p> <p>The first day's agenda - a gentle warm up - was scrapped, and soon we were lined up like soldiers at the top of a small bowl of new snow. Our guide went first, the snow flying over his head. It looked fun. </p> <p>None of us had skied powder before, and, as we soon found out, we lacked the basic skills needed to turn in the stuff. Like kamikaze pilots, we set off, quickly nose-diving into the snow and creating huge craters. In no time, the small bowl was dotted about with buried figures trying to dig themselves out - an exhausting process. But those few minutes before the crash were enough to get a taste and develop a determination to crack it. </p> <p>Until then, my annual ski holidays had followed a similar pattern. The resorts, companions and restaurants varied, but the first couple of days would always be spent limbering up on a few gentle cruisers, graduating later to more challenging terrain and black runs. Off piste was something that happened by mistake. </p> <p>The week in Flaine changed all that. We were whipped into shape, given confidence and taught tips that transformed our skiing. While we never grasped the rhythm that infuses the most fluid skiers, we made great progress. Enough for us to venture off the beaten piste with a mountain guide and discover a new world. </p> <p>What clinched it was an unforgettable off-piste descent of the 23km Vall\u00e9e Blanche. Any intermediate can ski this stunningly beautiful run that begins from the Aiguille du Midi cable car in the Chamonix valley. After a rather alarming start along the \" arr\u00ea t \", a narrow path bordered on one side by a steep drop, the route is a simple meander with magical views and scenery in the shadow of Mont Blanc. </p> <p>Nearly all skiers will follow the single piste, which is often crowded. But we left the piste far behind and made our own way across the snowy wilderness with no other skier ever in sight. </p> <p>With a few basic off-piste skills and a guide, your skiing possibilities instantly multiply. Small resorts become unlimited, crowded slopes become avoidable. </p> <p>If you want to explore a large ski area, such as the Trois Vall\u00e9es or L'Espace Killy, hiring a guide and splitting the cost between a few of you is an excellent way to discover the many linked villages without wasting time stopping to look at the piste map. Your guide will know where the best snow is and the best route for the weather conditions of the day. And, if he or she is a ski instructor, you will be able to jump the lift queues as well. </p> <p>Any ski instructor with the highest qualifications (in the case of British instructors, this is BASI I) is qualified to guide you around a resort and take you off piste. But they are not qualified or insured to take skiers on a glacier. For more extensive off-piste skiing, you will need to hire a qualified mountain guide. </p> <p>To become a member of the International Union of Mountain Guides (UIAGM), you must already be an established mountaineer, and the training takes a further three to five years. Mountain guides are easily recognisable, not so much by the blue UIAGM badge, but by the size of their rucksacks. The essential tools of the trade include avalanche transceivers, a shovel, probe, first-aid kit, tools for adjusting skis, and extra clothing. Many will also have other items, such as a rope for crevasse rescue or for climbing up or down a cliff, and a bivi pack if someone is injured or stranded. </p> <p>Any level of skier can enjoy the expertise of a guide and discover parts of the mountain they would be unwise to explore alone. Every resort has its couloirs and itineraires (off-piste routes). Many are tracked and easy to ski as long as you have someone qualified to show you the way. </p> <p>It can become addictive. Since those first inexperienced days in Flaine, I have found myself skiing off the back of the Valluga in St Anton, which descends the Pazieltal into Z\u00fcrs, putting skins on my skis to climb up Argenti\u00e8re's Col du Chardonnay, and being roped down the steep start of a run called the Pyramide in the Grandes Rousses near Alpe d'Huez. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Spread your weight evenly between both feet - both legs have to act as one unit.<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> On turns, apply exaggerated up-unweighted movement using pole plants to set the rhythm.<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Weight must be over the middle of the skis.

Do not sit back, but push your heels down into the snow on each turn to bring the tips up to the surface. Pack leaders 1 St Anton . Jens Borgnaes, 00 43 54 46 35 63 2 Chamonix.

Maps for the various walks can be collected at the tourist offices in Ebino-kogen and Takachihogawara, or contact the main tourist information office in Tokyo on 00 813 34 31 13 51. Here, the Japan National Tourist Organisation is on 0171-734 9638. In Indonesia , the mountains' eruptions are seen as a sign of anger from the gods. Gunung Bromo, on Java, has an annual festival when offerings are thrown into the crater in an attempt to pacify the gods. Organised tours can be arranged from the main tourist centres in Bali and Java. The Indonesian Tourist Office is on 0900 1600180. Mount Etna, in Italy, is Europe's largest active volcano. Tourist visits to the craters are restricted - when it blew in 1983, it took the tourist centre with it. Vesuvius is potentially the most dangerous, as the surrounding area is densely populated - emergency plans recommend the evacuation of 600,000 people in the event of rumblings. The tourist centre at Linguaglossa (for Etna) is on 00 39 095 64 30 94 and at Pompeii (for Vesuvius) on 00 39 081 850 72 55. The Italian tourist office in Britain is on 0900 1600280. Iceland sits precariously on top of the mid-Atlantic rift, and some 11% of the country is made up of lava fields. Active volcanoes include Eldfell on the Isle of Heimaey, Surtsey, Grimsv\u00f6tn and Krafla. The tourist office in the UK is on 0171-590 1100.",

      "body": "<p>I hated Brideshead Revisited when it was first broadcast in 1981. I so thoroughly misunderstood the TV adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's novel that I thought it was about contempt when really it was about love and loss. But who could blame me for that? I'd arrived in Oxford in the same year as Brideshead Revisited was aired and found it the coldest place on earth, cliquey and more class-ridden than anywhere I'd been in my life. I'd returned to England from my gap year in the US, where warm people had befriended me and found my accent entrancing. By contrast, Oxford seemed to be a student city that detested the outside world and many of the students who lived and worked there, especially those with provincial accents. My first memory of Oxford is of sitting at dinner in hall on my first evening in college and asking someone to pass me a glass down the long table. In the long, long silence that followed I waited for a response. \"Pass the glass?\" said someone eventually, mocking a northern accent. \"You mean parse the glarse.\" No one sent a glass down the table to me. </p> <p>Later that term, during a tutorial, I asked my tutor to tell me how to pronounce Kant. \"Kant or Karnt?\" I asked. \"Oh, it's Karnt,\" said my tutor, not unkindly, but authoritatively and yet wrongly. John Mortimer's adaptation of the novel seemed to be in league with these mispronunciations and the class criticism they implied. When Sebastian Flyte (played by Anthony Andrews) comes back from church one morning, he tells Charles, his friend and the narrator of novel and adaptation, that he has been to \"marse\". Surely nobody in the world spoke with such soft 'a's, not even extremely snooty Catholics? This seemed emblematic of the alienation I felt: I would never be a member of this club, I would never parse. But I felt furious as well as unworthy. This was the time and the place for a neutron bomb, not for an adaptation of a historical novel. I was oblivious to the tenderness and love that coursed through the programme, and instead saw everything in it as an affront to me, an insult that was confirmed by the coldness I felt from most of my fellow students and even from working-class people whose jobs were bound up with serving students. </p> <p>Charles Ryder first bumps into Sebastian Flyte at the barber's. Sebastian is leaving, carrying his large teddy bear. Charles's friend, who has accompanied him to have his haircut is revolted, but the barber is enchanted. And Charles, too, is preparing himself to be captivated. \"That was Lord Sebastian Flyte, a most amusing young gentleman,\" says the barber, unctuously removing the young men's coats before showing them to their chairs. \"He's the Marquis of Marchmain's second boy. His brother, the Earl of Marchmain, went down last term. He was very different.\" Flyte, says the barber, warming to his theme, had not wanted a haircut, but had come instead for \"a hair brush for his teddy bear. It had to have very firm bristles, not to brush him with but to threaten him with a spanking when he was sulky. He bought a very nice one with an ivory back. He's going to have Aloysius engraved on the back. That's the teddy bear's name.\" </p> <p>I loathed this speech. \"Too much information, you deferential throwback!\" I shouted at the screen. And yet, the barber isn't only deferential (though he was surely that, since such an attitude was common among tradespeople in cities such as Oxford in the inter-war years), but he is also, and over- whelmingly, charmed by Flyte, the golden boy with his adorable eccentricities - the lightness of him, his beauty. To all of this I was blind. Instead, I saw only contempt: the contempt of Sebastian Flyte for those who were not part of his charmed and charming circle; and the contempt of the barber for those who spoke with flat vowels and had set aside their teddy bears along with Andy Pandy a decade before. And I felt resentful contempt of my own, for Sebastian and his deferential barber. </p> <p>I have never been able to waft commandingly into a basement barber's with a camel coat over my shoulders, igniting smiles and happiness, to buy something frivolous. There was a time while I was an undergraduate when I had the double crown at the top of my forehead permed, true, but that was hardly a gesture of supreme decadence, nor did it win the admiration of crabby barbers or, indeed, anyone else. Instead, while I was at university I got my hair cut silently, studied hard, drank bitterly and got the Midland Red coach home, walking across dark allotments into a bright place where people were pleased to see me. It was only 56 miles away, and yet I crossed so many barriers to arrive and to leave. How could the country I lived in be so divided, even then, and how could the barriers be so close to home? </p> <p>When Sebastian next appears before Charles he is drunk. He is standing outside Charles's open ground-floor window in the quad, poised to throw up through the window and nearly over Charles's feet. He is sick, wipes his mouth and then, mustering the thinnest of smiles, disappears into the night with his rowdy friends. In the morning, Charles's scout (cleaner, servant, personal policeman, moral coach, confidant, all-round flunkey) cleans up the vomit. (Did it not occur to Charles to clean it up himself? How could he bear to sleep with that stench in his rooms overnight, particularly as he had now closed the windows?) The scout then picks up the five shillings, left there for his trouble, and tells Charles that he shouldn't drink so much. By the time Charles has returned from his lectures that same morning, though, the room is filled with flowers, along with an apologetic note from Sebastian. The scout, played by Bill Owen, is even now arranging the last of the bouquets. \"A most amusing young gentleman, sir,\" he says, warmly. \"I'm sure it's a pleasure to clean up after him!\" </p> <p>Again, this would never happen to me. It would never be a pleasure for anyone, still less a total stranger, to clean up my sick. No landlord would escort me to the door of his pub, wipe his face with a bar towel and then tell his friends: \"That Lord Stuart half drowned me with his own vomit. What a young wag he is, to be sure!\" </p> <p>Most of the friends I cultivated at Oxford were state-school pupils revolted by this dynamic which we saw on screen and which we thought was transposed into reality. From this culture of deference, though, we received no bounty since it was not offered to us. Still less, had we been accorded such deference, could we have stooped charmingly to pick it up with the grace of a Sebastian Flyte or the diffidence of a Charles Ryder. We had neither the skills, nor the temperament. This dynamic was a curious legacy from an earlier, more exclusive era that had to be stamped out; it was part of what, in the past, had kept the likes of us out. Most of us, obviously enough, took Jude The Obscure as our text: Jude's had been the fate of our ancestors - to build the walls that kept us out. Now, though, we were inside the walls, and it would be different - if only we didn't have to contend with working-class Judases conspiring against us. Or so it then seemed. </p> <p>For many of us, after all, attending university felt as though it was a huge responsibility, both to ourselves and to the generations before us who never dreamt of studying at a college, least of all at Oxford. Few of our parents had reached any form of tertiary education - though my father had, as his 30s turned into 40s, studied for a production engineering degree at Aston University. In the front room, which was off-limits to his children, my father had wrestled with mathematics and metallurgy, while I sat in the other room watching Andy Pandy, Dad's Army or the 1970 World Cup. Then he went to lectures where he sat amid long-haired youngsters with whom he had next to nothing in common. It wasn't, so far as I could judge, a time of strawberries and punting; he never had occasion to buy a hairbrush with which to admonish his recalcitrant teddy bear. </p> <p>When I learned I'd won a place to Oxford, I phoned my dad at work and remember him being really touched in a way that I'd not experienced before. \"You're cleverer than all of us,\" he said fondly, a remark that has danced happily around my head ever since. But I also took that remark as a responsibility: my cleverness, if that's what it was, shouldn't be thrown away when I went to Oxford. None of my forebears had had the chance to exhibit their cleverness or anything else at such a place, and so the weight of their exclusion lay heavy on my shoulders. </p> <p>I remember crying sentimental tears a few years later, in 1992, when I watched on television Neil Kinnock's party political broadcast. It was part of the same shockingly misguided presidential-style campaign that included the Sheffield rally, so I was prepared to be disgusted. But Kinnock asked why he and Glenys were the first people from their respective families in a thousand years to go to university. Why? Because between Sebastian Flyte's days and theirs, and indeed mine, egalitarian governments had established free education for all children and set up the ladder for us to climb. Working-class men who said things such as \"Lord Sebastian, such an amusing young man\" - they would never get their feet on the first rungs. They were holding themselves down, and they were making things more difficult for us. They made me and my friends angry, and yet we didn't know what to do with that anger, except to sit sullen in barber's chairs. </p> <p>We were recognisable by our lack of poise, by our uncertainty. These are the words, at least, of Richard Hoggart in The Uses Of Literacy, where he writes about the \"uprooted and the anxious\", the scholarship boys who leave their homes, first spiritually, through reading and education, then physically, by going away to college. They were the first to leave their societies, their classes, and they never really belonged anywhere again. By contrast, Sebastian Flyte, in the barber's, in the quad, at the lunch party, at mass, belonged everywhere - the world was his and he was comfortable with the arrangement. Who wouldn't be? </p> <p>Hoggart writes: \"I am chiefly concerned with those who are self-conscious and yet not self-aware in any full sense, who are as a result uncertain, dissatisfied, and gnawed by self-doubt. Sometimes they lack will, though they have intelligence, and 'it takes will to cross this waste'.\" I stood not long ago in a bookshop reading these words in tears, because they were about me - too much about me for comfort when I studied at Oxford. I've always wanted those three years back, so I could live them well, to live them wilfully and to cross the waste that much of that time was for me. I would have walked around with a teddy bear, or a real bear on a chain, or a lobster on a leash, and bought all three of them tailored silk pyjamas to wear when we went out in public. I would have carried my burden more lightly, not been overcome by a spirit of seriousness and of shame. </p> <p>There was another scene in Brideshead, that only now can I cherish - because the spirit of seriousness has taken flight from me, hopefully for good. Charles's cousin Jasper breaks off from his final exams to chide him about his now-hedonistic lifestyle. He dresses down Charles for his new flashy clothes, his profligacy, his choice of friends, his drinking. Charles smiles, reaches into a cupboard and produces a bottle of champagne which he proceeds to open while he defends himself: \"I usually have a glass of champagne, about this time. Will you join me?\" There was drinking for me at Oxford, but none of it had these light-hearted and insolent qualities. I wish everything I had done there had had such cheerful insolence. </p> <p>The characters Charles initially made friends with were academic pedants (one step up from proletarian scholars), who were never given the chance to flourish in our sight. As for the proletarian scholars of 20s' Oxford, we never got to see their kind. </p> <p>Perhaps now I'm getting nearer to why I hated Brideshead at the time and why I still feel uneasy about the drama, even though now I understand Waugh's novel. It is because the adaptation and the book allow of no other way of being at Oxford than that of Sebastian and his coterie. Near the beginning, Charles divides Oxford students into three classes - the flamboyant aesthetes (like Sebastian, like camp, reptilian Anthony Blanche), the proletarian scholars (whose characterisation is so thin that not one appears, even in the novel) and those, like his first friends and like his first undergraduate self, third-way academics in embryo, who appear as stereotypes rather than flesh and blood individuals. </p> <p>I felt tyrannised by this taxonomy, since I regarded it as being still true in 1981. There were privileged aesthetes who lived with beauty, and the rest of us who did not. But there was a fundamental difference between Charles's times at Oxford and my own - the flamboyant aesthetes of my day were copyists from whatever old Oxonian texts they could get their hands on, but, as they re-enacted these novels, they lost the books' charm. There were putative Zuleika Dobsons, acting out the adventures of the eponymous heroine of Max Beerbohm's 1911 novel in which a dazzling beauty visits Oxford and is responsible for a mass suicide among the students. And why not? There was in 1981 a dining society called The Dobson Society, which was women-only except for the male guests who were required to throw themselves into the river during Eights Week for the privilege. There was another called The Northey, which was named after Nancy Mitford's young femme fatale (you wouldn't expect an all-woman dining society at Oxford in 1981 to name itself after Sheena Easton, would you?) </p> <p>But most dining societies were all-male or male-dominated. The Knights of Marchmain, for instance, gallant cavaliers loyal to the aristocratic ethos of Brideshead Revisited, would as a post-dinner feat choose a woman to whom they would present red roses, chocolate and a Marchmain cocktail. That they were not often in a fit state to perform this was evinced by the fact that one of them skewered both feet on the gates of University College after delivering a cocktail to a lucky, lucky woman. The Scruton Society, named after the conservative philosopher Roger Scruton, would meet to discuss such questions as \"dealing with the lower orders\", though after their evenings few of them would be able to deal with undressing for bed. The Straight Line Society consisted of men who would, after their alcoholic dinners, put two pins in a map of central Oxford and walk the route it described - over roofs, through houses, bushes, theatres, concerts and philosophy lectures. They would walk over books, over my face, down through the basement barber's where men permed my hair silently, up over gables and cupolas, through my nightmares, through the orchestras playing at the Sheldonian Theatre, through libraries, poetry readings, football matches. On and on until they had finished marching. </p> <p>In such a context, when Charles was invited to a select luncheon in Sebastian's rooms, I was ready to be disgusted at the spectacle. I could take in none of the atmosphere of kindness, nor the beauty of the meal, nor, really, did I have a proper understanding of the exclusivity that is necessary for their kindness to be kind or their beauty beautiful - and so no powerful class analysis of the scene at all, just resentment. They started with plovers' eggs and champagne, and had moved on to lobster Thermidor when the last guest arrived. This guest was Anthony Blanche - poised, certain, catty Anthony - who, during the meal, memorably, or at least memorably to me, referred to a woman as a drab. I'd never heard that adjective become a noun before, and immediately feared that I was such a noun myself - a graceless, flat-vowelled drab. In Brideshead, there was no other story than that of decadents and of aesthetes and their self-righteous nostalgia for another age. Just as the TV adaptation of Brideshead was inspiring a nostalgia for an exclusive age that had died and been reborn in these corpses, I was bringing my hope to Oxford to be born. And the midwives of my hope were Anthony Blanche's pale imitators. </p> <p>When I saw Brideshead Revisited again in 1998, I felt strongly the words spoken by Captain Charles Ryder in the opening scene of the adaptation, lying awake in his military bunk to find himself 39 and loveless. \"Something within me, long sickening, had died,\" he says. And so it was with me, but what had been sickening in me was not a nostalgia for a charmed youth, still less a thwarted passion for a Catholic heiress, but a self-destructive bitterness concerning Oxford that I've outgrown. Now I am more healthy and stronger, only overtaken by a sense of loss for three years in time that could have been happier, had I had the will, had I not been so embroiled with a resentment for the Brideshead ethos, a resentment which Nietzsche describes thus: \"The noble man lives in trust and openness with himself, the man of resentment is neither upright nor naive nor honest and straightforward with himself. His soul squints.\" I insisted to myself that I would watch Brideshead without squinting. </p> <p>When I revisited Brideshead Revisited in 1998, I saw love and loss and, in the early episodes, a sort of kindness, which occasionally touched me. In the opening scene, for instance, Captain Charles Ryder fails to stop one of his men, Hooper, having his hair cut under the orders of a brutish colonel. The colonel considers Hooper's hair to be too long and so charges someone to deal with it. It recalls an officially inspired rape, a vulgar affair, a scene unfit to be seen by lords or teddy bears, from which Ryder walks away languidly. In Hooper's world, this is what happened: an unwilling soldier crudely hacks at his hair with scissors not designed for the task; in the other world, to which Hooper is not privy, teddy bears get better treatment. </p> <p>Afterwards, no one takes it upon themselves to console Hooper for this brutality. He is an unpopular officer, one who doesn't properly belong anywhere, but who is uprooted and anxious everywhere. Only later does Ryder make a point of apologising to Hooper. This was very well dramatised in the adaptation. In the book, the apology is merely reported, thus: \"It's not the sort of thing that usually happens in the regiment,\" I said. </p> <p>\"Oh, no hard feelings,\" said Hooper. \"I can take a bit of sport.\" </p> <p>In the TV adaptation, by contrast, this exchange takes place with a lovely rhythm. After the incident, Hooper and his men are marching from the camp. Ryder wheels into step with Hooper and offers him the apology. The rhythm is lovely because the marching comes to symbolise the onward march of history in which Waugh and his Ryder have no faith; the rhythm of the marching men is countered briefly by Ryder's gentility, his voice the last breath of proper kindness from a fast disappearing world. </p> <p>And yet, now, Ryder's kindness is hard for me to tolerate. The velvet of Ryder's gentility, after all, conceals the iron of his class hostility. This expression of Evelyn Waugh's loathing for the Hoopers of this world - the anxious and the uprooted. For Hooper is uprooted - thrown into the army with little understanding of how it worked; so comprehensively out of joint with his post (he is a platoon commander and Ryder's subordinate officer) that he addresses the men who are contemptuous of him by their first names, and yet receives no compensating solidarity from the officers around him since he is not one of their clarse: so much a wafer-thin character that he can be presented as a thoroughgoing professional incompetent without the viewer or the reader wondering why. We know next to nothing about Hooper, except that he is Charles Ryder's lustreless symbol of the Youth of England. He only exists in relation to Ryder's, and by extension Waugh's, lugubrious loathing for what the future held. But I at least wanted Hooper to become more than just Waugh's symbol. I wanted him to have a lustre all of his own. I should have made Brideshead Revisited a trilogy - the extant novel would have been flanked by a prequel about Hooper's early years and the sequel would have been called Hooper: The Radiant Years. </p> <p> The Hooper who exists in Brideshead Revisited, though, bears all the weight of Waugh's opprobrium. At the end of the TV series, as in the novel, Ryder rounds on Hooper in his thoughts. He is reflecting on the beauty of Brideshead, its august history, and its destruction by soldiers billeted in the house. \"The builders did not know the uses to which their work would descend; they made a new house with the stones of the old castle; year by year, generation after generation, they enriched and extended it; year by year, the great harvest of timber grew to ripeness; until, in the sudden frost, came the age of Hooper; the place was desolate and the work all brought to nothing; Quomodo sedet sola civitas . Vanity of vanities, all is vanities.\" </p> <p>Poor Hooper to have to bear all this. \"He was a sallow youth, with hair combed back, without parting, from his forehead, and a flat, Midland accent,\" reported Ryder early on. Poor Hooper, poor Stuart. Pictures of me at the time show me to have my hair combed back, without parting, from my forehead. Memories of the time show me to have had a flat, Midland accent that would never quite parse muster in Oxonian society, to my initial incredulity and continuing anger. </p> <p>Perhaps it is good that Hooper did not take Charles's kindness, but instead played down the significance of the incident. Ryder's gesture to Hooper was only one of politeness, of good form; it shows his breeding, not his empathy for or understanding of the affront to Hooper. Hooper may have been Waugh's unfeeling symbol of the rise of cultural materialism, his index of the shabbiness of Britain to come, but I would have comforted him with a better quality than Ryder could have attempted. Better than that, I wouldn't have allowed a public-school twit of a colonel to order that his hair be cut; unlike Ryder, who seemed incapable of even protesting against the incident, I would have rebelled in the name of Hooper. The likes of Hooper and his ancestors have suffered too much, unimagined by Waugh; and out of anger, and kindness, I would not have let the latest Hooper suffer another moment's indignity at the hands of someone who had not suffered enough. </p> <p>The rest of Brideshead has many such episodes of kindness that did not revolt me so. One, in particular, stayed with me. After the luncheon, Sebastian and Charles are the only ones left in the room. Sebastian suggests they go to the Botanical Gardens to look at the ivy. As they walk through the gardens, arm in arm, I take this - perhaps against the grain of the director's or, indeed, the author's intentions - as a gesture of tenderness and of consolation in a cruel world. No wonder Charles loves Sebastian and chooses his world above the cold ones that surround him at Oxford. I, too, would have liked someone to take me by the arm and show me the ivy. </p> <p>That tender love recalls Charles's reflection, years later, on that meeting with reproving Jasper. As Jasper leaves Charles's room, Jeremy Irons' languorous narration as the older, disaffected Charles Ryder, begins: \"Now I could have matched his gamecock maturity. I could have told him that to know and to love another human being is the root of wisdom.\" And I know now that it is. </p> <p>But hatred has its place, too. Once, my parents came to see me for the day and I took them on a walk around Oxford. We wound up standing at the side of the lake at Worcester College. Across the lake from us, and inaccessible, was a group of young, flamboyant aesthetes, drunk on Pimm's. The men wore boaters and blazers, the women summer dresses. It could have been a lovely scene for my parents to see, an English idyll, a costume drama as winningly fanciful as Brideshead Revisited or Inspector Morse. But it didn't belong to my parents or to me. It was ruined. \"Oh, look out those common people over there,\" yelled one to his friends, in a deliberately affected bray. My mother's face was furious, and my father's revolted: the likes of them still didn't belong here. We walked away, back to a cafe where there weren't many students. Now, I wish I had dived into that lake, swum across and killed them with an ivory-backed hairbrush, and stuffed teddy bears into their mouths. That's how I should have left Oxford - with blood on the blazers and boaters floating on the lake </p> <p>7#169; Stuart Jeffries, published by Flamingo, 2000</p>",

Instead, while I was at university I got my hair cut silently, studied hard, drank bitterly and got the Midland Red coach home, walking across dark allotments into a bright place where people were pleased to see me. It was only 56 miles away, and yet I crossed so many barriers to arrive and to leave. How could the country I lived in be so divided, even then, and how could the barriers be so close to home? When Sebastian next appears before Charles he is drunk. He is standing outside Charles's open ground-floor window in the quad, poised to throw up through the window and nearly over Charles's feet. He is sick, wipes his mouth and then, mustering the thinnest of smiles, disappears into the night with his rowdy friends. In the morning, Charles's scout (cleaner, servant, personal policeman, moral coach, confidant, all-round flunkey) cleans up the vomit. (Did it not occur to Charles to clean it up himself? How could he bear to sleep with that stench in his rooms overnight, particularly as he had now closed the windows?) The scout then picks up the five shillings, left there for his trouble, and tells Charles that he shouldn't drink so much. By the time Charles has returned from his lectures that same morning, though, the room is filled with flowers, along with an apologetic note from Sebastian. The scout, played by Bill Owen, is even now arranging the last of the bouquets. \"A most amusing young gentleman, sir,\" he says, warmly. \"I'm sure it's a pleasure to clean up after him!\" Again, this would never happen to me. It would never be a pleasure for anyone, still less a total stranger, to clean up my sick. No landlord would escort me to the door of his pub, wipe his face with a bar towel and then tell his friends: \"That Lord Stuart half drowned me with his own vomit. What a young wag he is, to be sure!\" Most of the friends I cultivated at Oxford were state-school pupils revolted by this dynamic which we saw on screen and which we thought was transposed into reality. From this culture of deference, though, we received no bounty since it was not offered to us. Still less, had we been accorded such deference, could we have stooped charmingly to pick it up with the grace of a Sebastian Flyte or the diffidence of a Charles Ryder. We had neither the skills, nor the temperament. This dynamic was a curious legacy from an earlier, more exclusive era that had to be stamped out; it was part of what, in the past, had kept the likes of us out. Most of us, obviously enough, took Jude The Obscure as our text: Jude's had been the fate of our ancestors - to build the walls that kept us out. Now, though, we were inside the walls, and it would be different - if only we didn't have to contend with working-class Judases conspiring against us. Or so it then seemed. For many of us, after all, attending university felt as though it was a huge responsibility, both to ourselves and to the generations before us who never dreamt of studying at a college, least of all at Oxford. Few of our parents had reached any form of tertiary education - though my father had, as his 30s turned into 40s, studied for a production engineering degree at Aston University. In the front room, which was off-limits to his children, my father had wrestled with mathematics and metallurgy, while I sat in the other room watching Andy Pandy, Dad's Army or the 1970 World Cup. Then he went to lectures where he sat amid long-haired youngsters with whom he had next to nothing in common. It wasn't, so far as I could judge, a time of strawberries and punting; he never had occasion to buy a hairbrush with which to admonish his recalcitrant teddy bear. When I learned I'd won a place to Oxford, I phoned my dad at work and remember him being really touched in a way that I'd not experienced before. \"You're cleverer than all of us,\" he said fondly, a remark that has danced happily around my head ever since. But I also took that remark as a responsibility: my cleverness, if that's what it was, shouldn't be thrown away when I went to Oxford. None of my forebears had had the chance to exhibit their cleverness or anything else at such a place, and so the weight of their exclusion lay heavy on my shoulders. I remember crying sentimental tears a few years later, in 1992, when I watched on television Neil Kinnock's party political broadcast. It was part of the same shockingly misguided presidential-style campaign that included the Sheffield rally, so I was prepared to be disgusted. But Kinnock asked why he and Glenys were the first people from their respective families in a thousand years to go to university. Why? Because between Sebastian Flyte's days and theirs, and indeed mine, egalitarian governments had established free education for all children and set up the ladder for us to climb. Working-class men who said things such as \"Lord Sebastian, such an amusing young man\" - they would never get their feet on the first rungs. They were holding themselves down, and they were making things more difficult for us. They made me and my friends angry, and yet we didn't know what to do with that anger, except to sit sullen in barber's chairs. We were recognisable by our lack of poise, by our uncertainty. These are the words, at least, of Richard Hoggart in The Uses Of Literacy, where he writes about the \"uprooted and the anxious\", the scholarship boys who leave their homes, first spiritually, through reading and education, then physically, by going away to college. They were the first to leave their societies, their classes, and they never really belonged anywhere again. By contrast, Sebastian Flyte, in the barber's, in the quad, at the lunch party, at mass, belonged everywhere - the world was his and he was comfortable with the arrangement. Who wouldn't be? Hoggart writes: \"I am chiefly concerned with those who are self-conscious and yet not self-aware in any full sense, who are as a result uncertain, dissatisfied, and gnawed by self-doubt. Sometimes they lack will, though they have intelligence, and 'it takes will to cross this waste'.\" I stood not long ago in a bookshop reading these words in tears, because they were about me - too much about me for comfort when I studied at Oxford. I've always wanted those three years back, so I could live them well, to live them wilfully and to cross the waste that much of that time was for me. I would have walked around with a teddy bear, or a real bear on a chain, or a lobster on a leash, and bought all three of them tailored silk pyjamas to wear when we went out in public. I would have carried my burden more lightly, not been overcome by a spirit of seriousness and of shame. There was another scene in Brideshead, that only now can I cherish - because the spirit of seriousness has taken flight from me, hopefully for good. Charles's cousin Jasper breaks off from his final exams to chide him about his now-hedonistic lifestyle. He dresses down Charles for his new flashy clothes, his profligacy, his choice of friends, his drinking. Charles smiles, reaches into a cupboard and produces a bottle of champagne which he proceeds to open while he defends himself: \"I usually have a glass of champagne, about this time. Will you join me?\" There was drinking for me at Oxford, but none of it had these light-hearted and insolent qualities. I wish everything I had done there had had such cheerful insolence. The characters Charles initially made friends with were academic pedants (one step up from proletarian scholars), who were never given the chance to flourish in our sight. As for the proletarian scholars of 20s' Oxford, we never got to see their kind. Perhaps now I'm getting nearer to why I hated Brideshead at the time and why I still feel uneasy about the drama, even though now I understand Waugh's novel. It is because the adaptation and the book allow of no other way of being at Oxford than that of Sebastian and his coterie. Near the beginning, Charles divides Oxford students into three classes - the flamboyant aesthetes (like Sebastian, like camp, reptilian Anthony Blanche), the proletarian scholars (whose characterisation is so thin that not one appears, even in the novel) and those, like his first friends and like his first undergraduate self, third-way academics in embryo, who appear as stereotypes rather than flesh and blood individuals. I felt tyrannised by this taxonomy, since I regarded it as being still true in 1981. There were privileged aesthetes who lived with beauty, and the rest of us who did not. But there was a fundamental difference between Charles's times at Oxford and my own - the flamboyant aesthetes of my day were copyists from whatever old Oxonian texts they could get their hands on, but, as they re-enacted these novels, they lost the books' charm. There were putative Zuleika Dobsons, acting out the adventures of the eponymous heroine of Max Beerbohm's 1911 novel in which a dazzling beauty visits Oxford and is responsible for a mass suicide among the students. And why not? There was in 1981 a dining society called The Dobson Society, which was women-only except for the male guests who were required to throw themselves into the river during Eights Week for the privilege. There was another called The Northey, which was named after Nancy Mitford's young femme fatale (you wouldn't expect an all-woman dining society at Oxford in 1981 to name itself after Sheena Easton, would you?) But most dining societies were all-male or male-dominated. The Knights of Marchmain, for instance, gallant cavaliers loyal to the aristocratic ethos of Brideshead Revisited, would as a post-dinner feat choose a woman to whom they would present red roses, chocolate and a Marchmain cocktail. That they were not often in a fit state to perform this was evinced by the fact that one of them skewered both feet on the gates of University College after delivering a cocktail to a lucky, lucky woman. The Scruton Society, named after the conservative philosopher Roger Scruton, would meet to discuss such questions as \"dealing with the lower orders\", though after their evenings few of them would be able to deal with undressing for bed. The Straight Line Society consisted of men who would, after their alcoholic dinners, put two pins in a map of central Oxford and walk the route it described - over roofs, through houses, bushes, theatres, concerts and philosophy lectures. They would walk over books, over my face, down through the basement barber's where men permed my hair silently, up over gables and cupolas, through my nightmares, through the orchestras playing at the Sheldonian Theatre, through libraries, poetry readings, football matches. On and on until they had finished marching. In such a context, when Charles was invited to a select luncheon in Sebastian's rooms, I was ready to be disgusted at the spectacle. I could take in none of the atmosphere of kindness, nor the beauty of the meal, nor, really, did I have a proper understanding of the exclusivity that is necessary for their kindness to be kind or their beauty beautiful - and so no powerful class analysis of the scene at all, just resentment. They started with plovers' eggs and champagne, and had moved on to lobster Thermidor when the last guest arrived. This guest was Anthony Blanche - poised, certain, catty Anthony - who, during the meal, memorably, or at least memorably to me, referred to a woman as a drab. I'd never heard that adjective become a noun before, and immediately feared that I was such a noun myself - a graceless, flat-vowelled drab. In Brideshead, there was no other story than that of decadents and of aesthetes and their self-righteous nostalgia for another age. Just as the TV adaptation of Brideshead was inspiring a nostalgia for an exclusive age that had died and been reborn in these corpses, I was bringing my hope to Oxford to be born. And the midwives of my hope were Anthony Blanche's pale imitators. When I saw Brideshead Revisited again in 1998, I felt strongly the words spoken by Captain Charles Ryder in the opening scene of the adaptation, lying awake in his military bunk to find himself 39 and loveless. \"Something within me, long sickening, had died,\" he says. And so it was with me, but what had been sickening in me was not a nostalgia for a charmed youth, still less a thwarted passion for a Catholic heiress, but a self-destructive bitterness concerning Oxford that I've outgrown. Now I am more healthy and stronger, only overtaken by a sense of loss for three years in time that could have been happier, had I had the will, had I not been so embroiled with a resentment for the Brideshead ethos, a resentment which Nietzsche describes thus: \"The noble man lives in trust and openness with himself, the man of resentment is neither upright nor naive nor honest and straightforward with himself. His soul squints.\" I insisted to myself that I would watch Brideshead without squinting. When I revisited Brideshead Revisited in 1998, I saw love and loss and, in the early episodes, a sort of kindness, which occasionally touched me. In the opening scene, for instance, Captain Charles Ryder fails to stop one of his men, Hooper, having his hair cut under the orders of a brutish colonel. The colonel considers Hooper's hair to be too long and so charges someone to deal with it. It recalls an officially inspired rape, a vulgar affair, a scene unfit to be seen by lords or teddy bears, from which Ryder walks away languidly. In Hooper's world, this is what happened: an unwilling soldier crudely hacks at his hair with scissors not designed for the task; in the other world, to which Hooper is not privy, teddy bears get better treatment. Afterwards, no one takes it upon themselves to console Hooper for this brutality. He is an unpopular officer, one who doesn't properly belong anywhere, but who is uprooted and anxious everywhere. Only later does Ryder make a point of apologising to Hooper. This was very well dramatised in the adaptation. In the book, the apology is merely reported, thus: \"It's not the sort of thing that usually happens in the regiment,\" I said. \"Oh, no hard feelings,\" said Hooper. \"I can take a bit of sport.\" In the TV adaptation, by contrast, this exchange takes place with a lovely rhythm. After the incident, Hooper and his men are marching from the camp. Ryder wheels into step with Hooper and offers him the apology. The rhythm is lovely because the marching comes to symbolise the onward march of history in which Waugh and his Ryder have no faith; the rhythm of the marching men is countered briefly by Ryder's gentility, his voice the last breath of proper kindness from a fast disappearing world. And yet, now, Ryder's kindness is hard for me to tolerate. The velvet of Ryder's gentility, after all, conceals the iron of his class hostility. This expression of Evelyn Waugh's loathing for the Hoopers of this world - the anxious and the uprooted. For Hooper is uprooted - thrown into the army with little understanding of how it worked; so comprehensively out of joint with his post (he is a platoon commander and Ryder's subordinate officer) that he addresses the men who are contemptuous of him by their first names, and yet receives no compensating solidarity from the officers around him since he is not one of their clarse: so much a wafer-thin character that he can be presented as a thoroughgoing professional incompetent without the viewer or the reader wondering why. We know next to nothing about Hooper, except that he is Charles Ryder's lustreless symbol of the Youth of England. He only exists in relation to Ryder's, and by extension Waugh's, lugubrious loathing for what the future held. But I at least wanted Hooper to become more than just Waugh's symbol. I wanted him to have a lustre all of his own. I should have made Brideshead Revisited a trilogy - the extant novel would have been flanked by a prequel about Hooper's early years and the sequel would have been called Hooper: The Radiant Years. The Hooper who exists in Brideshead Revisited, though, bears all the weight of Waugh's opprobrium. At the end of the TV series, as in the novel, Ryder rounds on Hooper in his thoughts. He is reflecting on the beauty of Brideshead, its august history, and its destruction by soldiers billeted in the house. \"The builders did not know the uses to which their work would descend; they made a new house with the stones of the old castle; year by year, generation after generation, they enriched and extended it; year by year, the great harvest of timber grew to ripeness; until, in the sudden frost, came the age of Hooper; the place was desolate and the work all brought to nothing; Quomodo sedet sola civitas . Vanity of vanities, all is vanities.\" Poor Hooper to have to bear all this. \"He was a sallow youth, with hair combed back, without parting, from his forehead, and a flat, Midland accent,\" reported Ryder early on. Poor Hooper, poor Stuart. Pictures of me at the time show me to have my hair combed back, without parting, from my forehead. Memories of the time show me to have had a flat, Midland accent that would never quite parse muster in Oxonian society, to my initial incredulity and continuing anger. Perhaps it is good that Hooper did not take Charles's kindness, but instead played down the significance of the incident. Ryder's gesture to Hooper was only one of politeness, of good form; it shows his breeding, not his empathy for or understanding of the affront to Hooper. Hooper may have been Waugh's unfeeling symbol of the rise of cultural materialism, his index of the shabbiness of Britain to come, but I would have comforted him with a better quality than Ryder could have attempted. Better than that, I wouldn't have allowed a public-school twit of a colonel to order that his hair be cut; unlike Ryder, who seemed incapable of even protesting against the incident, I would have rebelled in the name of Hooper. The likes of Hooper and his ancestors have suffered too much, unimagined by Waugh; and out of anger, and kindness, I would not have let the latest Hooper suffer another moment's indignity at the hands of someone who had not suffered enough. The rest of Brideshead has many such episodes of kindness that did not revolt me so. One, in particular, stayed with me. After the luncheon, Sebastian and Charles are the only ones left in the room. Sebastian suggests they go to the Botanical Gardens to look at the ivy. As they walk through the gardens, arm in arm, I take this - perhaps against the grain of the director's or, indeed, the author's intentions - as a gesture of tenderness and of consolation in a cruel world. No wonder Charles loves Sebastian and chooses his world above the cold ones that surround him at Oxford. I, too, would have liked someone to take me by the arm and show me the ivy. That tender love recalls Charles's reflection, years later, on that meeting with reproving Jasper. As Jasper leaves Charles's room, Jeremy Irons' languorous narration as the older, disaffected Charles Ryder, begins: \"Now I could have matched his gamecock maturity. I could have told him that to know and to love another human being is the root of wisdom.\" And I know now that it is. But hatred has its place, too. Once, my parents came to see me for the day and I took them on a walk around Oxford. We wound up standing at the side of the lake at Worcester College. Across the lake from us, and inaccessible, was a group of young, flamboyant aesthetes, drunk on Pimm's. The men wore boaters and blazers, the women summer dresses. It could have been a lovely scene for my parents to see, an English idyll, a costume drama as winningly fanciful as Brideshead Revisited or Inspector Morse. But it didn't belong to my parents or to me. It was ruined. \"Oh, look out those common people over there,\" yelled one to his friends, in a deliberately affected bray. My mother's face was furious, and my father's revolted: the likes of them still didn't belong here. We walked away, back to a cafe where there weren't many students. Now, I wish I had dived into that lake, swum across and killed them with an ivory-backed hairbrush, and stuffed teddy bears into their mouths. That's how I should have left Oxford - with blood on the blazers and boaters floating on the lake 7#169; Stuart Jeffries, published by Flamingo, 2000",

A good-luck charm: Sailors are very superstitious and I have a lucky purple T-shirt, which I have had for 17 years. I wear it most days. I always take my lucky pen-knife as well. If only: If I could go straight to the fishing grounds, either by magic or by helicopter, that would be fantastic. \u0095 The Hungry Ocean, Linda Greenlaw's account of life as a swordfish captain, is published by Sceptre at \u00a37.99.",

We were sitting on a rock, on the flat grassy land by the Langtang river, and we were wearing every piece of clothing we had. The air was freezing, but clear. The nearest road was several days' brisk walk away. Neither of us had washed all week. We were happy. </p> <p>Walking in the Langtang region, even without the added surprise of a proposal, is sublime. </p> <p>We began in the small town of Dhunche, around eight hours' drive from Kathmandu. People sat in the sun, picking lice out of each other's hair. A toddler played a solemn game, digging a hole in the earth. Older children rolled bicycle tyres down the road. Every step took us further from the millennium, further from our home in Greenwich, where our local pub was charging \u00a3250 for the evening. From here, the West looked like a decadent society, one that had lost touch with what matters. </p> <p>It may be too easy to idealise Nepal, the world's eighth poorest country, as the calm Other to the frantic west. More than half the people live below the poverty line: its GNP is $190 per capita, little more than 1% of the UK figure. Large areas of the country never see a doctor. </p> <p>But given the choice between poverty in London and poverty in Nepal, I know which I'd choose. As we turned off the crumbling road on our first day, and took the grassy path uphill, nothing but the immediate moment seemed to matter. </p> <p>There were few other trekkers: the Langtang is, for some reason, visited far less frequently than the Everest and Annapurna regions, and this was the low season. </p> <p>The days were crisp and clear; we wore T-shirts in the sun, and fleeces in the shade (at night we froze). Ahead of us was a range of Tibetan peaks; we were only 20km from the border. All the way up the valley, there were yaks and Tibetan settlements. The Tibetan \"tashi dele\" replaced the Nepalese \"namaste\" as the usual greeting. </p> <p>We walked happily by ourselves, stopping at lodges en route, where we were usually the only guests. Lodge owners only ever charge a nominal sum for a bed. In the low season, they are almost always free. They make their money from food, and we did them proud on that score. The bedrooms were unheated, there was no electricity, but every lodge had a big stove in the main room, and we spent each evening sitting around one with the family. </p> <p>The paths are so well walked, and the locals so helpful, that we didn't feel any need for a guide. We could carry our own bags, so we didn't need a porter. </p> <p>We spent one night in Ghora Tabela, a small cluster of houses that used to be a summer camp for nomads. Now, because of the trekking trade, it is lived in year round. The name means \"grazing place for horses\" and, sure enough, a white horse with a bell round its neck jingled comfortingly all night long. </p> <p>The walk up was hard. On the first day, we misjudged things entirely, and spent the final hour stumbling along by torchlight next to a sheer drop to the rocky river. It took time to adjust to the change of pace, to realise that we were ruled by such basic considerations as the time the sun sets. As James encouraged me up hill after hill, leg muscles made their existence felt for the first time since I did ballet as a child. </p> <p>On the second day, I realised I had a choice. I could keep muttering: \"I can't do it. My feet hurt. My legs ache. But at least I'm losing weight,\" or I could appreciate the fact that I was in a wide open space, breathing crystal air, surrounded on all sides by snow-capped mountains. The cobwebs blew away. </p> <p>The only time I seriously doubted finishing the walk was on New Year's Eve, when we contravened accepted wisdom and climbed 1,000m to an altitude of 4,000m. We suffered for it. James put on a brave face, but I couldn't dredge one up. The valley, steep and close all the way up, began to open out. I knew it was beautiful, but I was nauseous, and my head seemed about to explode. When we did arrive, I got straight into the sleeping bag and closed my eyes. James made me eat, but I couldn't stomach anything sophisticated. My last two meals of 1999 consisted of plates of potatoes. </p> <p>We couldn't stay awake till midnight. During the evening, we heard fireworks nearby: the Nepalese were not particularly impressed with our new year - for them it was already 2056 - but they were happy to go along with it. I wasn't. I held my head and despaired. </p> <p>But when the alarm went off at 5.30am, I discovered I had acclimatised overnight. It was dark and icy.

We got to Syrabu Bensi, to catch the bus, in two days. We breathed the air, smiled at the ring, and felt boundlessly energetic.

      "body": "<p>They came for us the moment we slipped over the netting and into the enclosure, an explosion of fins and grins darting about us in the clear, warm waters of the Red Sea. And what a racket they made. Click! Ping! Chirp! Crackle! Peep! Were these two dolphins talking to each other? Were they talking to me? Should I reply? </p> <p>Through my snorkel I bellowed a waterlogged \"Hello!\" and Domino - recognisable from the white mark on her dorsal fin - zipped nearer and presented her back for stroking. In the light of the morning sun, a tapestry of battlescars glistened on her impossibly shiny grey body. This frisky 14-year-old had lived a little. </p> <p>Domino was one of the six original dolphins (there are now 11) brought from the Black Sea to Eilat, a holiday resort on Israel's southern coast, to form a unique type of nature reserve - a place guided by what you might call the doctrine of \"dolphin choice\". A giant net stretching into the sea marks out the borders of Dolphin Reef but it's got two gates, always open, so our finned friends can scarper any time. They may nip out now and again to really stretch their dorsals, but they always come back. </p> <p>This pioneering ethos has bred a pride and confidence at the site best summed up by the name given to the pod's most recent addition: Yampa, the cutest little bottlenose you ever did see, born to Domino last summer and currently the pint-sized star attraction at the reef's four daily shows (sorry, not shows, \"interactions\"). Previously, the dolphins were given the kind of names you'd give a pony - Cindy, Bungee - but Yampa comes from the Hebrew words yam , meaning sea, and patuach , meaning open. In other words, Open Sea. </p> <p>We had 25 minutes in the water with the dolphins, every second of it spent marvelling at these creatures that seem equally as fascinated with us. Why do we like them so much? Maybe it's because you don't have to do much to earn their friendship: just turn up in wetsuit and snorkel, splash about clumsily, and they'll come at you with all the eagerness of a puppy bringing the morning paper - only, given their renowned intelligence, they'll probably have read the paper first and got halfway through the crossword. Or maybe it's just the fact that they were lucky enough to be born with broad grins and gentle eyes, and we are suckers for that kind of thing. </p> <p>Then, of course, there are the tricks. At the 2pm interaction, from a pier extending into the reef, we witnessed a display of synchronised swimming as dazzling as the mid-afternoon sun. We watched three \"porpoise\", as it's called, in perfect unison, arching in and out of the water at speed, as if trying to sew the sea to the sky - a trick they use in the wild to shake off predators. If they'd suddenly produced canes, top hats and started tap-dancing, no one on the pier - except perhaps the blokes from Berlin University, who have a base there to study these majestic mammals - would have been surprised. </p> <p>Perhaps most impressive of all was the fact that the dolphins are fed before they do their tricks, not after. So if they don't feel like performing, they don't have to. Again, dolphin choice. </p> <p>Situated in the sliver of Israeli land between Egypt and Jordan, Eilat made its name as a diving centre, but there's plenty to do above the waves as well. Although it's not the most beautiful resort in the world - colossal hotels all but obscure the surrounding red-tinted mountains - it's a lively place with busy beaches, bars and clubs, and any type of restaurant you want. </p> <p>Eilat is also an excellent base for daytrips. The ruins of the clifftop settlement of Masada - a place synonymous in Israel with the spirit of defiance, thanks to one horrifying day of mass bloodshed in 73AD - is just a few hours away by coach across the desert. Situated atop a sheer-sided plateau overlooking what were once key trade roads through the desert plains, Masada was a stronghold of great strategic importance. In 70AD, its 1,000 Jewish inhabitants, called the Zealots, found themselves besieged by the Romans, who massed troops in their thousands around the base of the plateau. </p> <p>The Zealots held out for an incredible three years. But those three years of defiance are not what made Masada so famous. When the Romans finally breached the fortifications, the Zealots, realising all was lost, took an extraordinary decision. Rather than let them fall into enemy hands, they set fire to their houses and their possessions. Then they took their own lives. Ten men were selected by lots and given the job of slaying the rest. Nine of them were then killed by the tenth, who duly took his own life. </p> <p>We walked after our guide, Asaf, along the dusty remains of thoroughfares that must have run with blood, wondering how it must have felt to be a Roman soldier preparing for battle only to find your foe slain by his own hand. The invaders found only two women and five children alive. They had survived by hiding. </p> <p>Excavation at Masada began in the 1960s and is still going on. Up at the north end - past the remains of the swimming pool and the bath-house, and near the spot tucked into the side of the cliff that some believe was a cocktail bar - there's a picture of Bill and Hillary Clinton joining in a dig. This is a hint at the wider, political context of these ruins, at the fact that this sobering story of siege and defiance from long ago is seen as having parallels with Israel today. Indeed, the army holds swearing-in ceremonies among these ruins. \"Masada shall not fall again,\" the young soldiers shout. </p> <p>After all that, it's a relief to take the cablecar back to ground level, switch your brain off, pull on your swimming costume and join the tourist throng in the tiny segment of the Dead Sea that's open to the public. About eight times saltier than your average ocean, the \"Sea of the Devil\" has to be treated with respect. Thick with magnesium chloride, its water is actually 33% solid, will sting badly if it gets in your eyes and can make you vomit if it gets in your mouth. Such is its level of buoyancy that overweight swimmers have been known to flop over on to their fronts and stay that way, unable to right themselves. Some have drowned. But, all that aside, there's no denying that having an effortless float here is a thrilling, if not entirely comfortable, experience. </p> <p>Also a few hours' drive from Eilat, in neighbouring Jordan, is the legendary pink city of Petra. Its facades, as ornate and grand as any in Paris or Rome, are made all the more impressive once you know that they were chiselled into existence from the sides of cliffs, by artisans perched on precarious scaffolding. </p> <p>And, of course, as they never tire of telling you, this is the place where Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was filmed. Those staying the night in the nearby town will be hard-pushed to find a hotel not showing the movie on video. </p> <p>Back in Eilat, we set off for what was called \"an evening of Israeli folklore\" at a local kibbutz, but which could equally have been entitled \"a total piss-up with nonsensical singing\". Seated in a huge hall with about 200 other guests, we were brought carafe after carafe of wine, glass after glass of beer, and commanded to dig into the superb food laid out on tables at the back. Then a chirpy compere appeared and told us all to shout \"Bum\" at him. </p> <p> Actually, it wasn't that simple. In the early days of Israel, when the 1950 Law of Return granted citizenship to any Jew requesting it, there was a sudden influx of people from around the world. On their kibbutzim, or collective farms, they shared a common cause - working the generally barren and inhospitable land to build a country - but they lacked a common language to sing in and build a culture. \"But then,\" explained our compere, \"we made a discovery. There is an international language after all.\" </p> <p>They composed songs by using the international language of meaningless musical words: la-la-la, dee-dee-dee, bum-bum-bum, and so on. To illustrate his point, he split the room into three and had us all join in with certain parts of the gibberish, until the whole room shook with strangers competing to see who could yell bum the loudest. As the night progressed, the beer flowed faster, the singing got louder and sweaty bodies jostled for space on the dancefloor to perform movements that were as impossible to fathom as the lyrics of the songs. </p> <p>As cultures go, it seemed a pretty good start. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Longwood Holidays (0181-551 4494) offers seven nights' B&amp;B in Eilat, at King Solomon's Palace Hotel, from \u00a3427pp, including return flights and transfers. The same package at Edomit Hotel costs \u00a3309pp. Dolphin Reef is open all year from 9am to 5pm. The entrance fee for adults is 35NIS (\u00a35.75) and 28NIS for children.

About eight times saltier than your average ocean, the \"Sea of the Devil\" has to be treated with respect. Thick with magnesium chloride, its water is actually 33% solid, will sting badly if it gets in your eyes and can make you vomit if it gets in your mouth. Such is its level of buoyancy that overweight swimmers have been known to flop over on to their fronts and stay that way, unable to right themselves. Some have drowned. But, all that aside, there's no denying that having an effortless float here is a thrilling, if not entirely comfortable, experience. Also a few hours' drive from Eilat, in neighbouring Jordan, is the legendary pink city of Petra. Its facades, as ornate and grand as any in Paris or Rome, are made all the more impressive once you know that they were chiselled into existence from the sides of cliffs, by artisans perched on precarious scaffolding. And, of course, as they never tire of telling you, this is the place where Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was filmed. Those staying the night in the nearby town will be hard-pushed to find a hotel not showing the movie on video. Back in Eilat, we set off for what was called \"an evening of Israeli folklore\" at a local kibbutz, but which could equally have been entitled \"a total piss-up with nonsensical singing\". Seated in a huge hall with about 200 other guests, we were brought carafe after carafe of wine, glass after glass of beer, and commanded to dig into the superb food laid out on tables at the back. Then a chirpy compere appeared and told us all to shout \"Bum\" at him. Actually, it wasn't that simple. In the early days of Israel, when the 1950 Law of Return granted citizenship to any Jew requesting it, there was a sudden influx of people from around the world. On their kibbutzim, or collective farms, they shared a common cause - working the generally barren and inhospitable land to build a country - but they lacked a common language to sing in and build a culture. \"But then,\" explained our compere, \"we made a discovery. There is an international language after all.\" They composed songs by using the international language of meaningless musical words: la-la-la, dee-dee-dee, bum-bum-bum, and so on. To illustrate his point, he split the room into three and had us all join in with certain parts of the gibberish, until the whole room shook with strangers competing to see who could yell bum the loudest. As the night progressed, the beer flowed faster, the singing got louder and sweaty bodies jostled for space on the dancefloor to perform movements that were as impossible to fathom as the lyrics of the songs. As cultures go, it seemed a pretty good start. The practicals Longwood Holidays (0181-551 4494) offers seven nights' B&amp;B in Eilat, at King Solomon's Palace Hotel, from \u00a3427pp, including return flights and transfers. The same package at Edomit Hotel costs \u00a3309pp. Dolphin Reef is open all year from 9am to 5pm. The entrance fee for adults is 35NIS (\u00a35.75) and 28NIS for children.

      "body": "<p>If ancestral roots in the slave trade are the main draw for American tourists to this corner of West Africa, my visit was also motivated by a sense of history. Personal history. Accra, the capital of Ghana, was where I spent most of the first 10 years of my life, and I was embarked on a journey of rediscovery with my father, Michael, who went out as a colonial administrator during the second world war and stayed for 17 years, till the Gold Coast gained independence in 1957. This was his first return in 40 years. </p> <p>Ghana's rapidly growing population has put an enormous strain on the country's fragile economy and an education system of which it is justly proud (UN secretary-general Kofi Annan went to school not far from Elmina). </p> <p>Accra, whose airport is the point of entry for most visitors, is the first surprise. So vast and sprawling - the city covers 10 times the area it did in 1960 and is almost unrecognisable. Every road seems permanently choked with traffic and the fumes of thousands of badly-tuned diesel engines. Every taxi ride, however short, takes at least 40 minutes and leaves your lungs feeling like those of a smoker with a terminal habit. What the pollution does to the hordes of young traders trying to sell bread or chewing gum through car windows scarcely bears thinking about. </p> <p>All in all, not an attractive place to spend more than a day or two, though the people here, as elsewhere in Ghana, are extraordinarily friendly and good-natured, and there is an endless amount of fun to be had reading the names of the shops and factories as you sit in traffic jams: Charisma Shopping Centre, French Kiss Caf\u00e9 and God First Terrazzo Works. Religion touches almost everything in Ghana, a tribute either to the missionaries' zeal or Africans' easy acceptance of the Gospel. </p> <p>Accra has any number of monuments either created by or dedicated to the late Dr Kwame Nkrumah. Despite the army coup that forced Ghana's founding father into exile and death in neighbouring Guinea, President Jerry Rawlings has seen fit to build a mausoleum for him on the sea front. We choose not to visit it, preferring to admire the two bronze statues of Nkrumah in the gardens of the national museum, one missing its arms after he - and it - were toppled in 1966. </p> <p>The museum itself is full of fascinating artefacts, including fine examples of kente cloth, historical regalia, wooden carvings and a selection of royal stools with such gnomic inscriptions as \"He who follows the elephant encounters no dew\". Attached to the museum is a well-run self-service restaurant where, for less than \u00a32.50, you can sample a wide range of Ghanaian cuisine. It's a useful introduction because, in many of the cheaper hotels and restaurants, the local grub is all that's worth eating. </p> <p>Most meals comprise one course with two main ingredients: a grapefruit-sized ball or two of fufu or banku , depending on whether it's made from pounded cassava, yam or fermented maize, and a fish or chicken stew to add flavour. Scoop a ball of the white starch in your hand, dip it into the peppery stew, and then pop it into your mouth. </p> <p>Easier said than done. Most food is cooked in the red oil of palm nuts, and all too often I was left looking like a clown whose make-up had slipped. Thank heavens for the bowl of water and washing-up liquid that came with the meal. Then I discovered red-red : fried plantains with black-eyed beans. It rapidly became a favourite, not least because even Africans eat it with a knife and fork. </p> <p>There are three principal routes out of Accra. To the north-west lies the Ashanti kingdom with its capital in Kumasi, to the west the Cape Coast region, with its string of old European castles and forts. But our trip down nostalgia lane takes us east along the coast through dry savannah country towards the Togo border. With our knuckle-popping young Ghanaian driver at the wheel of a 4WD Toyota Landcruiser, we head for Ada, on the mouth of the Volta river, where my father was a young district commissioner just after the war. </p> <p>Hotels in Ghana veer from a few expensive establishments along the coast, where everything is priced in US dollars, to mid-range and cheap hotels that have a faintly dilapidated air but where the Ghanaian cedi goes a long way. </p> <p>The Paradise Beach Hotel at Ada offers all the comforts of an upmarket hotel, with a large swimming pool, a great view across the Volta and an attractive setting for a get-away-from-it-all holiday in Africa. One note of caution: the incidence of bilharzia - a worm infection transmitted by snails in slow-moving water - has risen since the Volta dam was built and slowed the river flow downstream. </p> <p>The short drive from Ada to the river bridge at Sogakope takes us through the village of Vum\u00eb, where large, colourful pots line the roadside. The distinguished English potter Michael Cardew spent several years upgrading and running the local pottery during my father's stint as DC. We stop and are taken to meet the elderly village chief. Of course he remembers Cardew. \"He came during the Attlee administration,\" he recalls. </p> <p>From Sogakope, we take the dirt road north to Ho, whose large open-air market offers an array of local produce, including trays of tripe and giant snails for those with strong stomachs. From there, we head west to Akosombo and a night at the Volta Hotel. Situated about two hours' drive from Accra, this well-kept hotel offers an attractive weekend escape from the crowded capital. From here, it is possible to take day trips to a small island or longer, more adventurous voyages on the 250-mile-long Volta Lake. </p> <p>The long cross-country drive to Kumasi follows an escarpment before entering a region of tropical rainforest that I remember well from my childhood. But where are the trees? The answer becomes apparent as we crawl into Kumasi past large wood factories. Timber, along with cocoa, is one of Ghana's chief exports but, at the rate the forests are being felled, we fear there will be little left to log in 20 years' time. </p> <p> Kumasi is the true cultural heart of Ghana. Although the British made Accra their colonial capital, Kumasi has a king - the Asantehene - and a golden stool that symbolises a proud Ashanti empire that long predates European interest in West Africa. It took many years in the late 19th century for the British to subdue the spirited Ashanti, and it was only with the capture and exile of Prempeh I to Seychelles 100 years ago that British control over the Gold Coast was complete. </p> <p>Manhyia Palace, built to mark the Asantehene's return from exile in 1926, is open to the public, but no cameras are allowed inside and you must be accompanied by a guide. The two-storey palace is a veritable time capsule filled with the absurd gifts of visiting dignitaries. Cupboards drip with heavy gold ornaments that the king wears on Akan religious days, and alarmingly lifelike effigies of past kings and queen mothers greet you in several of the rooms. </p> <p>Our two nights at Kumasi are spent at the grand but gloomy City Hotel, built among the spacious bungalows in the old colonial quarter. The state-run hotel appears to have had no money spent on it since it was built in the early 1960s. No one remembers when it last had running hot water. But the staff are more than willing to bring up steaming buckets and cheerfully turn out at all hours to replace broken fittings. This is a cedi hotel, costing the equivalent of \u00a313 a night for a double room. </p> <p>The road down to the coast to Elmina passes Kakum National Park. Although forest elephants and the fabled bongo are said to inhabit this corner of preserved rainforest, its main attraction is the spectacular rope walk in the forest canopy - one of only four of its kind in the world. </p> <p>A uniformed guide takes groups through the forest to the first of a series of walk ways suspended between huge tropical trees. It is probably as well that the ground is invisible 50ft below as we take it in turns to bounce along the narrow planks, desperately clutching at the cable handholds for reassurance. </p> <p>After a reasonably gruelling week on pot-holed roads, the attraction of the beach and a cool sea breeze are almost overwhelming. We spend a couple of nights at the Elmina Beach Resort, still in the process of construction, and our last night before catching the flight home at the top-of-the-range Labadi Beach Hotel, just outside Accra, where my family spent many happy Sundays by the beach. </p> <p>Ghana hasn't been yet spoilt by tourism, which is still in its infancy. Although conspicuous by our colour, we felt almost invisible in Accra. As visitors, we were everywhere greeted with a friendliness that would put most Brits to shame. When Ghanaians say \"You are welcome\", they say it as if they really mean it. The country may have changed out of recognition in 40 years, but, as my father and I were pleased to note, the people remain as warm as ever.</p> <p> <strong>'The abandoned fort that was my office stands lapped by the sea'</strong></p> <p> <strong> Michael Ensor</strong></p> <p> Ghana, well endowed at the time of independence and with a stable currency, soon descended, as the result of reduced earnings from cocoa and other exports and mismanagement, into an economic trough from which it is only now starting to climb. The inflation that its currency underwent is reflected today in the fact that the highest denomination of banknote is worth around \u00a31. As a result, in a country where credit cards are not widely accepted, the traveller is put to the inconvenience of having to carry a thick bundle of notes. </p> <p>Women used to play a major part in Ghana's retail trade, enjoying a monopoly of the market in foodstuffs and textiles. So much so that when fishermen brought their catch to the beach, it was at once taken over by their women. With the spread of girls' education, women have moved upwards to play an important part in the more complex commercial sector. </p> <p>After several coups, political stability seems to have returned with a president and legislature elected by a system the revision of whose mechanism was my last task in Ghana. But it is still thought prudent to maintain frequent police road checks, which are not only for the detection of traffic offences, and to restrict photography in unlikely places. </p> <p>The greatest improvement that I perceived came from the increasingly widespread supply of electricity from the hydro-electric plant below the Volta dam. As well as providing illumination, it powers village water supplies and cornmills, which is a boon for women. How my wife would have appreciated the end of oil lamps during our postings away from headquarters. Now air-conditioning improves the comfort of visitors. There can be few Ghanaians who still feel that the flooding of nearly 10% of the country was too high a price to pay. </p> <p>Ghana's road network has been greatly extended and this has enabled more outlying farmers to produce food for urban markets as well as subsistence crops. To the east of Accra, a second bridge replacing the ferry across the lower Volta together with improvements to trunk roads have halved many journey times. But secondary roads are as unreliable as I remember them, especially in the rainy season. </p> <p>A development that saddened me was the harm that had been done to Ghana's palm-fringed coastline by the ravages of a disease of coconut palms that leaves unsightly frond-less trunks. Added to this, marine erosion has washed away much of Keta, where the abandoned remains of the attractive 18th-century Danish fort that was my office and court stand lapped by the sea that has cut the coastal road to the east and is threatening to break through to the lagoon. </p> <p><br><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p>British Airways (0345 222111 ) has return flights to Accra from \u00a3450 plus \u00a337.90 tax; KLM (0870 5074074) from \u00a3438 inc tax and Ghana Airways (0171-499 0201) from \u00a3275 inc tax.<br> Insight Travel (01995 606095, e-mail:<a href=\"mailto:insight@provider. co.uk\"> insight@provider. co.uk</a>) organises tailor-made trips, based in Kumasi, with the opportunity of staying with a Ghanaian family.

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday came under renewed attack over its policy on arms exports as MPs found there had been no radical shift under Labour on weapons sales to Indonesia and serious questions remained over the supply of defence equipment to Zimbabwe and Pakistan. A joint report from the cross-party defence, foreign affairs, international development, and trade and industry committees also criticised the continuing secrecy surrounding arms sales. It expressed dismay over the government's failure to implement recommendations made four years ago in the Scott arms-to-Iraq report, specifically the repeal of emergency wartime powers, and allowing parliament to scrutinise arms exports more effectively. On Indonesia, it says the only change was a \"heightened distaste\" for arms exports because of human rights abuses under the former Suharto regime. The absence of \"any radical or demonstrable change\" in government policy meant none of the 125 licences granted by its Conservative predecessor was revoked. They include licences for Hawk jets - an unidentified number of which have yet to be delivered - as well as armoured combat vehicles delivered despite Labour guidelines stating that arms would not be exported if they were likely to be used in internal repression. The MPs say the government approved at least one licence that could have led to the upgrading of Indonesia's military capability at a time when its forces were being condemned for their brutality in east Timor. The MPs disclose that the government has extended existing licences until March 2001 to make up for the period \"lost\" after the EU imposed a four-month embargo last year. Britain was instrumental in getting the embargo lifted last month. Reviewing the Tory licences would have been \"entirely practicable\", they say. Legal advice obtained by the committees suggested that the government could have survived a legal challenge if it had revoked the licences as a result of a change in foreign policy. The MPs express regret that the government refused to show them its legal advice, or even name the firm of lawyers which gave it, despite repeated requests to do so. They refer to recent Guardian disclosures that Tony Blair overruled Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, by agreeing to send spare Hawk parts to Zimbabwe, now embroiled in the Congo civil war, and an internal government dispute over arms sales to Pakistan. These raised \"wider issue of public policy\" on which they intended to question ministers further. Earlier this week Mr Blair said he was tightening up arms export controls covering countries involved in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The MPs say the government should now draw up and publish guidelines \"governing the extent to which the UK feels bound to license spares for existing UK-supplied equipment\". Annual reports covering arms exports should in future give details of the number of items covered by each export licence as well as their total value by country. The MPs call for a \"more stringent national policy\" on arms brokering and trafficking and say that the problem of licensed production of British-designed arms overseas should be given a far higher priority. They recognise that the government nevertheless gives more information about arms sales than any of its EU partners. \"It is important that we do not damage the competitive position of UK defence exporters in world markets.\" The EU code of conduct fell \"some way short of a system whereby a licence can be refused simply because of pervasive abuse of human rights in the country to which arms are to be exported\". Paul Eavis, director of Saferworld, an independent research body, said yesterday it would be \"outrageous\" if no legislation on Sir Richard Scott's recommendations was forthcoming before the next election. The foreign office minister, Peter Hain, said yesterday the government would look seriously at the recommendations and give a detailed response. \"But don't lose sight of what we have achieved.

The longer he resists pressure for change, the more divisive and dangerous will be his efforts to suppress it. His reputation, once high at home and abroad, has suffered badly. By clinging to power regardless, he will only further damage Zimbabwe and himself. The country cries out for a fresh start. It would better all round if Mr Mugabe, now 75, voluntarily heeded that call.",

Donovan Lindo, 36, suffered 65% burns when petrol was poured over him in Brixton, south London, on Thursday evening. Police have arrested a man and a woman in north London and were last night questioning them in connection with the incident.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Peter Tatchell is the only man in Britain who is publicly defined by his sexuality. Many public figures are well known to be gay, but it is incidental to their real interest and importance. Tatchell only forces his way into our minds when he is crusading against homophobia. And the passionate intensity with which he fights his holy war leaves no doubt that being what he is happy to call \"queer\" is his whole life. When he chose to call his jihad OutRage! he was doing more than warning the establishment that he meant to cause offence.</p> <p>He was expressing his anger at society's rejection of what he believes is a beautiful way of life. It is real emotion - as well as a less attractive exhibitionist streak - which makes him mount his often bizarre campaigns, such as organising a gay crucifixion (complete with transvestite nuns who call themselves the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence).</p> <p>His impact has been immense. Last Monday when the House of Lords debated (and defeated) the repeal of Section 28, which prohibits the promotion of homosexuality in schools, peers who were determined that the prohibition should remain quoted Tatchell as an authority on gay life. He had, they claimed, admitted that the disputed clause did not encourage classroom bullying or prevent teachers from protecting persecuted pupils. But on Tuesday he said their action \"was a vote for continued censorship and homophobia in schools. It maintains the system of sexual apartheid that treats lesbians and gay men as second-class citizens.\"</p> <p>He has pursued his cause so dramatically - demonstrating against Michael Portillo's \"hypocrisy\" in allowing discrimination against homosexuals in the armed forces, despite the \"sexual experiments\" of his youth; and attempting a \"citizen's arrest\" of President Mugabe of Zimbabwe to bring him to trial for actions against two homosexual journalists - that he risks becoming what every homophobe believes all gays to be.</p> <p>It would be wrong, and deeply offensive to Tatchell himself, to suggest that, as he celebrates 30 years of continuous campaigning, he has begun to mellow. But these days, he argues that his \"ideas are at least as important as his activism\". If people ignore his plans for creating a world free from sexual inhibitions, he must take some of the blame. Anyone who attempts to rally parliamentary support for homosexual reform with the slogan \"Drop Your Trousers and Bend Over for your Member\" cannot expect much serious consideration of his pamphlet on the limits of legal equality.</p> <p>Yet Tatchell is a profoundly serious man and, in many ways, an admirable one. He is brave, honest and absolutely sincere in his determination to build an unprejudiced world. And although he boasts of the three lovers who share his affection, he also seems irredeemably innocent about the ways of the real world. He is unwilling (and perhaps unable) to consider that he might damage his own cause by the extremism of his liberationist position.</p> <p>When he describes \"cottaging\" (a form of promiscuity which many gay men think gives homosexuality a bad name) as \"no different from any other hobby or pastime... a fantastically pleasurable pursuit... for some gay men, casual anonymous sex is a great thrill\", it is not clear whether he is speaking out for sexual tolerance or takes a perverse pride in being shocking. But as he eulogises on, \"Meet a total stranger... wonderful passionate sex... spontaneity... thrill of the unknown\", it is easy to understand why some gay couples, living in peaceful stability, fear that he prejudices, rather than protects, their interests.</p> <p>There is no doubt that Tatchell would defend heterosexuals who choose to enjoy a parallel pleasure. For he challenges \"not only homophobia but also puritanism and patriarchy\" with a contempt for established sexual mores that can best be described as moral anarchy. He chooses to denounce restraint in the language of homosexual liberation because he happens to be gay. But he opposes all forms of personal repression. That is why he condemns \"the gay ambition to appropriate every civil right that heterosexuals have\".</p> <p>In his judgment, the inhibitions imposed by society guarantee that not even \"straights\" are free. That is a view of life which infuriates not only choleric retired colonels and wizened spinsters. Michael Cashman, now a Labour Member of the European Parliament and once a pillar of Stonewall, the most representative gay pressure group, says that if Tatchell is not struggling for equality and parallel civil liberties, \"he ought to stop pretending to represent the thousands of gay men and women who are\".</p> <p>Cashman expresses the fear that both Tatchell's philosophy and his tactics \"prejudice the growing consensus which has brought about so many improvements during the last eight years\" and described the often intentionally offensive tactics employed by OutRage! as \"counter-productive\". But Cashman was anxious to emphasise that Tatchell himself is \"utterly sincere\". The distinction between the man and his methods was echoed by even the most severe critics of his belief in direct and often scandalous action. The common conclusion was that he is \"well intentioned\" but \"misguided\".</p> <p>The history of his early years in Melbourne seem to confirm that, whatever part of his make-up is the direct product of nature, nurture gave him good cause to be outraged at his treatment by society. Although he describes his early years as containing \"moments of great happiness and great sadness\", he clearly endured a dismal childhood. His father (a lathe operator) and his mother (a bank clerk who had come down in the world) were divorced when young Peter was four. He remembers - or imagines he remembers - the sorrow he felt at their parting and his subsequent estrangement from his father. But it is his mother (\"very talented_ her parents encouraged her to learn recitations and she appeared on radio\") for whom he clearly felt most admiration and affection.</p> <p>\"She might have become an actress,\" but life upon the stage was incompatible with the highly religious views of her family. So she sank back into marriage and the bleak existence of \"an ordinary working class, inner city family with no aspiration to anything\", and her son was brought up in a house with \"no books except an atlas, a bible, a family encyclopedia and two tracts of prophecy from the church\".</p> <p>He had, however, no difficulty in deciding how to spend his spare time. His mother was a chronic asthmatic. \"When she was ill, especially when she was in hospital, I looked after my brother and, when my sister was born, her as well. I taught myself how to cook, sew and iron. From the age of eight I was changing nappies and heating up milk.\" He insists that he has \"done enough parenting for one lifetime\".</p> <p>Remarriage did very little to relieve the family's poverty. But the religious intensity of life increased. Tatchell describes his youth, in a desperately poor and fervently Pentecostal household, with real pathos. \"By comparison with other kids at school my birthday presents were pitiful. All my clothes were darned or second hand.\" And he speaks of his taxi-driver stepfather (\"didn't own it... just took a percentage of the fare\") with near contempt. The family income was \"very, very modest\". Australia had no health service, so much of his stepfather's wage \"small enough in itself\", was spent on health care for his mother.</p> <p>And religion, instead of providing some sort of comfort, only made life harder. \"It was a narrow-minded, fundamentalist, fire-and-brimstone sort of Christianity. We never went to the pictures.\" For years the family did not possess a television set. Then, when they could afford one, his stepfather, fearing that it was a corrupting influence, limited its use to two hours in the early evening. When he was 14, Tatchell left the Pentecostal church and became a Baptist. For a time, he taught Sunday school. He says the faith has gone but the ethic remains, except when it conflicts with his views on personal liberation.</p> <p>In those early Australian years, he was an enthusiastic athlete; not team games but climbing, surfing and hiking. He was so popular at school that the other pupils elected him head boy, although in that \"often brutally macho community\" he was recognised as different. \"They realised that I was gay before I realised it myself and called me 'Poofter Pete'\", a description which he accepted as the sort of thing you get at school, like name-calling about being fat or freckled. He also thought it a compliment when he was adjudged to have better legs than any of the teenagers at a nearby girls' school.</p> <p>At 15 - \"the family needed the wages\" - he started work at Meyers, Melbourne's biggest department store. Hard years of insults and mockery have taught him that it is better to raise the laugh himself than for somebody else to make the cheap jibe. So, when he says that he \"worked in design and display\" - an elevated description of window dressing - he calls it \"typical gay stereotyping\". It was there that he enjoyed what he calls his \"first full sexual experience\". His partner was a colleague at the shop and the two men have remained friends ever since. Tatchell was 17 when the relationship began. So he describes himself, without a hint of irony, as \"a late developer\".</p> <p>One of his proposed \"reforms\", which he fears have been obscured from press attention by his more newsworthy demonstrations, is a call for the age of consent of both sexes to be reduced to 14. The country is not quite with him on this either; parliament this week was debating reducing the age of consent for homosexual men from 18 to 16. Tatchell quotes a survey which suggests: \"Nearly half of all teenagers have their first sexual experience before the age of 16, most after 14\", and complains about \"the criminalisation of the tens of thousands of teenagers (homo and hetero) who have sex before they are 16\", which he thinks inhibits education about the importance of safe sex.</p> <p>He takes the subject very seriously and promotes the good cause with what he believes to be a talent for inventing a good slogan: \"If He Hasn't Got it On, Don't Let Him Have it Off\". He actually believes that his argument is strengthened by statistics which show that almost 1,000 men are prosecuted each year for unlawful intercourse with underage girls.</p> <p>Angela Mason, executive secretary of Stonewall, regards his campaign to lower the age of consent as \"a gift to the opponents\" and \"absolutely counterproductive\". She describes Tatchell as \"sincere but misguided\". Mason at least speculates on the need for a gay advance guard to storm the bastions of prejudice before the more reasonable forces of consensual reform move in to occupy the high ground of principle. But she comes down against the idea. She thinks that, for his own sake and that of the cause for which he campaigns, Tatchell \"might be wise to get himself a job\" outside the narrow confines of the gay community.</p> <p>It is an idea which he totally rejects. \"There is,\" he says, \"so much homophobia in the world that I can go on fighting it forever and still not see its end.\" There is no doubt that he is prepared to make sacrifices for the cause. In order to carry on the fight, he lives in the \"hard to let\" Elephant and Castle flat into which he moved when he was Labour's candidate in the 1983 Bermondsey byelection and subsists (close to the poverty line) on a meagre income from books and journalism.</p> <p>Despite newspaper smears, he \"only lived on benefit during the few weeks after the byelection\" when he was \"getting things back together\". If poverty is the cost of keeping up the battle, he pays the price willingly. All Tatchell's liberationist theories are advanced with a piety which makes plain that he is not simply glad to be gay. He is ecstatic about it. He can \"remember every detail of that first night\" when he decided \"if this is what it's like to be gay, I'm gay and it's wonderful\".</p> <p>The campaigns were years away, but sex gave him a new confidence at the same time as work politicised and liberated him. Australia had sent troops to fight alongside the Americans in Vietnam and Tatchell was determined not to be drafted to join them. In the months before he was due to register for conscription in the late 60s he became active in the peace movement. \"We were,\" he says, as if he still cares, \"represented in parliament and press as traitors and fifth columnists. Anti-war marches were attacked by baton-wielding police on horseback. We expected to get our heads split open and that is what happened. We went underground and printed leaflets, encouraging young men to refuse the draft, in a printing press hidden in a cellar.\"</p> <p>He clearly enjoyed the romance of clandestine subversion, but not enough to make him stay in Australia. In 1971, shortly after his 19th birthday, he emigrated to England. In Melbourne \"there was no gay organisation, not even a switchboard or a helpline\". It is clear that he felt in desperate need of comfort and support. For he speaks with a combination of gratitude and amazement at the discovery that in the Mother Country, homosexuals banded together to demand recognition and rights.</p> <p>On his second day in England he passed a lamp-post on which a poster advertising the Gay Liberation Front had been hung. On day five of his new life he attended his first gay rights meeting. Within a month he was beginning to organise the front's campaigns. Despite his instant commitment to the cause, he might have remained just another homosexual dissident had not fate and inclination taken him into the Labour Party.</p> <p>His instinct was for community politics. And he gave up a good liv ing, as a freelance in design and display, first to obtain some basic qualifications and then to become a social worker with the North Lambeth housing agency in Waterloo. He also began to recruit new members to his local Labour party, an activity which he insists was entirely innocent and, at the time, much welcomed by the old guard.</p> <p>Of course, he continued his campaigning with the Gay Liberation Front. \"In 1979\" he says bitterly, \"the number of gay men being arrested was higher than before the change in the law\" which decriminalised homosexual relations between consenting adults. The outrage is genuine and constantly breaks the surface of his conversation like the bubbles in the lava of a temporarily quiet volcano.</p> <p>In 1982 Bob Mellish - the MP for Bermondsey and ex-government chief whip - was appointed deputy chairman of the London Docks Corporation and announced that he would not be a candidate at the next general election. Labour was moving left and without the need to organise support, Tatchell was selected to replace him. Tatchell's brand of socialism was not, by the standards of the time, notably extreme. He was neither a Marxist nor a Militant. But he talked incessantly of \"mobilising the grassroots\".</p> <p>He also wrote a couple of articles for the extreme-left newsletter Labour Briefing, an activity still regarded as proof of subversive inclinations. Both of them applauded \"extra-parliamentary activity\", though Tatchell now insists he meant that the marches and demonstrations should augment, rather than replace, the democratic duties of the House of Commons. But his alleged contempt for parliament was the pretext on which the campaign to overturn his selection was based.</p> <p>No doubt his overt belief that \"Gay is Good\", helped to mobilise die-hard Labour opinion against him. But his real crime was opposing what he now calls \"the old-style mafia,\" which ran the local party, and exposing what he still insists was inefficiency that bordered on corruption, including \"grandiose schemes like spending \u00a350m on a new town hall when council house repairs were years in arrears\".</p> <p>He now makes the improbable claim that he would have survived the strictures and the censure had he responded to the sexual advances of a long dead (and publicly homophobic) Labour hero. But whether or not he was the victim of the animosity which follows rejection, he was certainly made a scape-goat for catastrophes which were not of his making.</p> <p>Bob Mellish discovered that he would not be paid his Docks Corporation salary while he remained an MP. So he decided to leave parliament at once. Labour therefore had to face the prospect of a gay, draft-dodging, community socialist being caught in the spotlight of a byelection campaign. The \"old right\" elevated \"stopping Tatchell\" into a test of Michael Foot's ability to lead the party back to sanity. In the House of Commons, Jim Wellbeloved, (a Labour defector who had joined Shirley Williams, Roy Jenkins and Bill Rodgers in the SDP) challenged the Labour leader to disown the Bermondsey party's choice of candidate.</p> <p>Foot's response was categoric. Tatchell would not fight the byelection. He now explains. \"At the time, I had never met him. But it had been put to me that he was the sort of person who opposes parliament itself. And I had my duties towards the party which I wanted to keep in one piece. A few days later he came to see me and it became clear that he had a real concern for the party as well as himself.\"</p> <p>Reinforced by what amounted to a national party uprising against the proposed proscription, Foot suggested a compromise. In the interests of the party, Mellish should abandon the idea of a byelection and Tatchell's candidature should be endorsed in the knowledge that, when the general election came, he would be less conspicuous. In Foot's view, \"Tatchell behaved entirely honourably and comes out of the whole thing pretty well\", but \"Mellish went back on his word\" and resigned from the House of Commons.</p> <p>In the byelection campaign which followed, Tatchell was doomed from the start. Monica Foot, Labour's byelection press officer, says she told Tatchell that he must decide for himself how to deal with the question of his homosexuality. But Tatchell clearly believed the Labour high command expected that, when asked if he was gay, he should categorically refuse to discuss the subject.</p> <p>Whoever was to blame, Tatchell fell back on a defence which, though reasonable for others, was ridiculous for him. Private lives should remain private. No one else respected that view. John O'Grady, (Mellish's friend, sometime leader of Southwark Council and the Real Labour Candidate) toured the constituency with a loudhailer, singing songs about Tatchell wearing his trousers back to front. Liberal canvassers whispered that the Labour man was gay. A once-safe Labour seat elected Simon Hughes, the Liberal candidate, with a 10,000-vote majority.</p> <p>Tatchell - forced to prevaricate about the part of his life which gave him most pleasure and pride - was traumatised for weeks after the campaign was over. Mason believes that \"Bermondsey changed him\". Cashman says \"the people who behaved so badly have a lot to answer for\", and includes in his condemnation both the newspapers who hounded the Labour candidate and the party officers who persuaded him to hide his homosexuality.</p> <p>Richard Holloway, the Bishop of Edinburgh, who pleaded for leniency when Tatchell was convicted of \"obscene behaviour in church\" (interrupting the Archbishop of Canterbury in mid-sermon, at Easter 1998) describes the consequences of the campaign more dramatically: \"It was in Bermondsey that the iron entered his soul.\" Holloway, a man notable for his compassionate and progressive views, began his defence of Tatchell's \"undoubted sincerity\" with the disclaimer that everyone seems to find necessary before expressing any other opinion. He has \"the strongest reservation\" about the tactics of a man he says has \"many of the positive characteristics of old testament prophets - some of whom were unattractively unforgiving people\".</p> <p>The bishop was referring to the practice of \"outing\" - the public identification as homosexuals, of men who have denied, or kept secret, their gay inclinations. For a time, Tatchell made a particular habit of outing bishops, justifying the pain he caused on the grounds that they were party to the Anglican Church's discrimination against gay clergy. Bishop Holloway recalls the pain \"it caused to good men\".</p> <p>Tatchell is unrepentant and defends himself against the accusation that he always chose soft targets for his exposure with the unheroic explanation that he knows the name of a dozen gay MPs who vote for homophobic laws, but cannot expose their hypocrisy because he does not possess enough evidence to resist a libel case. He does, however, claim that private letters pleading with MPs to reveal their true nature resulted in one or two conversions and subsequent votes (in the House of Commons) in favour of reducing the age of homosexual consent to 16.</p> <p>He also makes the dubious claim that the most famous attempted exposure - of David Hope, then Bishop of London, in 1995 - was not an outing at all. Then he spoils his unconvincing denial with the added insistence that if it was, he was not responsible for it. Convinced of the Bishop's homosexuality - largely because Dr Hope had been head of a notoriously gay seminary - Tatchell delivered by hand what he still claims was intended to be a private letter. It urged the bishop to be true to what OutRage! believed to be his nature and, by admitting his sexuality, help to convince the church that it was an honourable estate.</p> <p>The letter, he insists, contained no threat of exposure, but was just a plea for help and understanding. \"But a journalist went to see Hope and told him that we were going to out him. So he called a press conference and talked about his sexuality being a grey area.\" Dr Hope, now Archbishop of York, upstaged Tatchell and his would-be tormentor clearly resents it. \"The letter was intended to be private and he gave it to the press without the courtesy of letting me know.\"</p> <p>Courtesy has not been a general feature of OutRage! campaigns. The self-righteous certainty makes it easy for some to dislike Peter Tatchell. So does his constant whining about the way he is treated by the press, an unlikely complaint for a man who has tried so hard to heap public contempt on \"the closet gays\" he calls hypocrites for attempting to keep their private lives private. But the real argument about his 30-year campaign is less concerned with his personal foibles than with the result of his efforts.</p> <p>When he ran in front of John Major's car in 1996, brandishing a poster which demanded a reduction in the age of consent, he first claimed that his intended victim \"dived for cover behind the driver's seat\". Tatchell then announced, \"We got the prime minister to bend over for gay men for the first time in his life\". Asked how he can justify such frivolous treatment of a serious cause, he replies that he believes in \"the importance of wit and humour\".</p> <p>Asked if his tactics often denied him support that his cause desperately needed, he dismisses the suggestion with the heroic (but irrelevant) announcement that he would not compromise with homophobia. That is why, last November, he planned to lead a group of gay ex-servicemen who, complete with campaign medals, would lay their wreaths at the Cenotaph. He trusted that the demonstration would cause offence. But he thought of them as the shock troops of gay liberation, breaching the walls of prejudice in the hope that less daring reinforcements would follow.</p> <p>It would be easier to believe that Tatchell operates in the belief that OutRage! does more good than harm if he showed any sign of understanding the penalties of causing calculated offence. But he refuses even to consider the fears of his gay critics.

      "bodyText": "Peter Tatchell is the only man in Britain who is publicly defined by his sexuality. Many public figures are well known to be gay, but it is incidental to their real interest and importance. Tatchell only forces his way into our minds when he is crusading against homophobia. And the passionate intensity with which he fights his holy war leaves no doubt that being what he is happy to call \"queer\" is his whole life. When he chose to call his jihad OutRage! he was doing more than warning the establishment that he meant to cause offence. He was expressing his anger at society's rejection of what he believes is a beautiful way of life. It is real emotion - as well as a less attractive exhibitionist streak - which makes him mount his often bizarre campaigns, such as organising a gay crucifixion (complete with transvestite nuns who call themselves the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence). His impact has been immense. Last Monday when the House of Lords debated (and defeated) the repeal of Section 28, which prohibits the promotion of homosexuality in schools, peers who were determined that the prohibition should remain quoted Tatchell as an authority on gay life. He had, they claimed, admitted that the disputed clause did not encourage classroom bullying or prevent teachers from protecting persecuted pupils. But on Tuesday he said their action \"was a vote for continued censorship and homophobia in schools. It maintains the system of sexual apartheid that treats lesbians and gay men as second-class citizens.\" He has pursued his cause so dramatically - demonstrating against Michael Portillo's \"hypocrisy\" in allowing discrimination against homosexuals in the armed forces, despite the \"sexual experiments\" of his youth; and attempting a \"citizen's arrest\" of President Mugabe of Zimbabwe to bring him to trial for actions against two homosexual journalists - that he risks becoming what every homophobe believes all gays to be. It would be wrong, and deeply offensive to Tatchell himself, to suggest that, as he celebrates 30 years of continuous campaigning, he has begun to mellow. But these days, he argues that his \"ideas are at least as important as his activism\". If people ignore his plans for creating a world free from sexual inhibitions, he must take some of the blame. Anyone who attempts to rally parliamentary support for homosexual reform with the slogan \"Drop Your Trousers and Bend Over for your Member\" cannot expect much serious consideration of his pamphlet on the limits of legal equality. Yet Tatchell is a profoundly serious man and, in many ways, an admirable one. He is brave, honest and absolutely sincere in his determination to build an unprejudiced world. And although he boasts of the three lovers who share his affection, he also seems irredeemably innocent about the ways of the real world. He is unwilling (and perhaps unable) to consider that he might damage his own cause by the extremism of his liberationist position. When he describes \"cottaging\" (a form of promiscuity which many gay men think gives homosexuality a bad name) as \"no different from any other hobby or pastime... a fantastically pleasurable pursuit... for some gay men, casual anonymous sex is a great thrill\", it is not clear whether he is speaking out for sexual tolerance or takes a perverse pride in being shocking. But as he eulogises on, \"Meet a total stranger... wonderful passionate sex... spontaneity... thrill of the unknown\", it is easy to understand why some gay couples, living in peaceful stability, fear that he prejudices, rather than protects, their interests. There is no doubt that Tatchell would defend heterosexuals who choose to enjoy a parallel pleasure. For he challenges \"not only homophobia but also puritanism and patriarchy\" with a contempt for established sexual mores that can best be described as moral anarchy. He chooses to denounce restraint in the language of homosexual liberation because he happens to be gay. But he opposes all forms of personal repression. That is why he condemns \"the gay ambition to appropriate every civil right that heterosexuals have\". In his judgment, the inhibitions imposed by society guarantee that not even \"straights\" are free. That is a view of life which infuriates not only choleric retired colonels and wizened spinsters.

Anti-war marches were attacked by baton-wielding police on horseback. We expected to get our heads split open and that is what happened. We went underground and printed leaflets, encouraging young men to refuse the draft, in a printing press hidden in a cellar.\" He clearly enjoyed the romance of clandestine subversion, but not enough to make him stay in Australia. In 1971, shortly after his 19th birthday, he emigrated to England. In Melbourne \"there was no gay organisation, not even a switchboard or a helpline\". It is clear that he felt in desperate need of comfort and support. For he speaks with a combination of gratitude and amazement at the discovery that in the Mother Country, homosexuals banded together to demand recognition and rights. On his second day in England he passed a lamp-post on which a poster advertising the Gay Liberation Front had been hung. On day five of his new life he attended his first gay rights meeting. Within a month he was beginning to organise the front's campaigns. Despite his instant commitment to the cause, he might have remained just another homosexual dissident had not fate and inclination taken him into the Labour Party. His instinct was for community politics. And he gave up a good liv ing, as a freelance in design and display, first to obtain some basic qualifications and then to become a social worker with the North Lambeth housing agency in Waterloo. He also began to recruit new members to his local Labour party, an activity which he insists was entirely innocent and, at the time, much welcomed by the old guard. Of course, he continued his campaigning with the Gay Liberation Front. \"In 1979\" he says bitterly, \"the number of gay men being arrested was higher than before the change in the law\" which decriminalised homosexual relations between consenting adults. The outrage is genuine and constantly breaks the surface of his conversation like the bubbles in the lava of a temporarily quiet volcano. In 1982 Bob Mellish - the MP for Bermondsey and ex-government chief whip - was appointed deputy chairman of the London Docks Corporation and announced that he would not be a candidate at the next general election. Labour was moving left and without the need to organise support, Tatchell was selected to replace him. Tatchell's brand of socialism was not, by the standards of the time, notably extreme. He was neither a Marxist nor a Militant. But he talked incessantly of \"mobilising the grassroots\". He also wrote a couple of articles for the extreme-left newsletter Labour Briefing, an activity still regarded as proof of subversive inclinations. Both of them applauded \"extra-parliamentary activity\", though Tatchell now insists he meant that the marches and demonstrations should augment, rather than replace, the democratic duties of the House of Commons. But his alleged contempt for parliament was the pretext on which the campaign to overturn his selection was based. No doubt his overt belief that \"Gay is Good\", helped to mobilise die-hard Labour opinion against him. But his real crime was opposing what he now calls \"the old-style mafia,\" which ran the local party, and exposing what he still insists was inefficiency that bordered on corruption, including \"grandiose schemes like spending \u00a350m on a new town hall when council house repairs were years in arrears\". He now makes the improbable claim that he would have survived the strictures and the censure had he responded to the sexual advances of a long dead (and publicly homophobic) Labour hero. But whether or not he was the victim of the animosity which follows rejection, he was certainly made a scape-goat for catastrophes which were not of his making. Bob Mellish discovered that he would not be paid his Docks Corporation salary while he remained an MP. So he decided to leave parliament at once. Labour therefore had to face the prospect of a gay, draft-dodging, community socialist being caught in the spotlight of a byelection campaign. The \"old right\" elevated \"stopping Tatchell\" into a test of Michael Foot's ability to lead the party back to sanity. In the House of Commons, Jim Wellbeloved, (a Labour defector who had joined Shirley Williams, Roy Jenkins and Bill Rodgers in the SDP) challenged the Labour leader to disown the Bermondsey party's choice of candidate. Foot's response was categoric. Tatchell would not fight the byelection. He now explains. \"At the time, I had never met him. But it had been put to me that he was the sort of person who opposes parliament itself. And I had my duties towards the party which I wanted to keep in one piece. A few days later he came to see me and it became clear that he had a real concern for the party as well as himself.\" Reinforced by what amounted to a national party uprising against the proposed proscription, Foot suggested a compromise. In the interests of the party, Mellish should abandon the idea of a byelection and Tatchell's candidature should be endorsed in the knowledge that, when the general election came, he would be less conspicuous. In Foot's view, \"Tatchell behaved entirely honourably and comes out of the whole thing pretty well\", but \"Mellish went back on his word\" and resigned from the House of Commons. In the byelection campaign which followed, Tatchell was doomed from the start. Monica Foot, Labour's byelection press officer, says she told Tatchell that he must decide for himself how to deal with the question of his homosexuality. But Tatchell clearly believed the Labour high command expected that, when asked if he was gay, he should categorically refuse to discuss the subject. Whoever was to blame, Tatchell fell back on a defence which, though reasonable for others, was ridiculous for him. Private lives should remain private. No one else respected that view. John O'Grady, (Mellish's friend, sometime leader of Southwark Council and the Real Labour Candidate) toured the constituency with a loudhailer, singing songs about Tatchell wearing his trousers back to front. Liberal canvassers whispered that the Labour man was gay. A once-safe Labour seat elected Simon Hughes, the Liberal candidate, with a 10,000-vote majority. Tatchell - forced to prevaricate about the part of his life which gave him most pleasure and pride - was traumatised for weeks after the campaign was over. Mason believes that \"Bermondsey changed him\". Cashman says \"the people who behaved so badly have a lot to answer for\", and includes in his condemnation both the newspapers who hounded the Labour candidate and the party officers who persuaded him to hide his homosexuality. Richard Holloway, the Bishop of Edinburgh, who pleaded for leniency when Tatchell was convicted of \"obscene behaviour in church\" (interrupting the Archbishop of Canterbury in mid-sermon, at Easter 1998) describes the consequences of the campaign more dramatically: \"It was in Bermondsey that the iron entered his soul.\" Holloway, a man notable for his compassionate and progressive views, began his defence of Tatchell's \"undoubted sincerity\" with the disclaimer that everyone seems to find necessary before expressing any other opinion. He has \"the strongest reservation\" about the tactics of a man he says has \"many of the positive characteristics of old testament prophets - some of whom were unattractively unforgiving people\". The bishop was referring to the practice of \"outing\" - the public identification as homosexuals, of men who have denied, or kept secret, their gay inclinations. For a time, Tatchell made a particular habit of outing bishops, justifying the pain he caused on the grounds that they were party to the Anglican Church's discrimination against gay clergy. Bishop Holloway recalls the pain \"it caused to good men\". Tatchell is unrepentant and defends himself against the accusation that he always chose soft targets for his exposure with the unheroic explanation that he knows the name of a dozen gay MPs who vote for homophobic laws, but cannot expose their hypocrisy because he does not possess enough evidence to resist a libel case. He does, however, claim that private letters pleading with MPs to reveal their true nature resulted in one or two conversions and subsequent votes (in the House of Commons) in favour of reducing the age of homosexual consent to 16. He also makes the dubious claim that the most famous attempted exposure - of David Hope, then Bishop of London, in 1995 - was not an outing at all. Then he spoils his unconvincing denial with the added insistence that if it was, he was not responsible for it. Convinced of the Bishop's homosexuality - largely because Dr Hope had been head of a notoriously gay seminary - Tatchell delivered by hand what he still claims was intended to be a private letter. It urged the bishop to be true to what OutRage! believed to be his nature and, by admitting his sexuality, help to convince the church that it was an honourable estate. The letter, he insists, contained no threat of exposure, but was just a plea for help and understanding. \"But a journalist went to see Hope and told him that we were going to out him. So he called a press conference and talked about his sexuality being a grey area.\" Dr Hope, now Archbishop of York, upstaged Tatchell and his would-be tormentor clearly resents it. \"The letter was intended to be private and he gave it to the press without the courtesy of letting me know.\" Courtesy has not been a general feature of OutRage! campaigns. The self-righteous certainty makes it easy for some to dislike Peter Tatchell. So does his constant whining about the way he is treated by the press, an unlikely complaint for a man who has tried so hard to heap public contempt on \"the closet gays\" he calls hypocrites for attempting to keep their private lives private. But the real argument about his 30-year campaign is less concerned with his personal foibles than with the result of his efforts. When he ran in front of John Major's car in 1996, brandishing a poster which demanded a reduction in the age of consent, he first claimed that his intended victim \"dived for cover behind the driver's seat\". Tatchell then announced, \"We got the prime minister to bend over for gay men for the first time in his life\". Asked how he can justify such frivolous treatment of a serious cause, he replies that he believes in \"the importance of wit and humour\". Asked if his tactics often denied him support that his cause desperately needed, he dismisses the suggestion with the heroic (but irrelevant) announcement that he would not compromise with homophobia. That is why, last November, he planned to lead a group of gay ex-servicemen who, complete with campaign medals, would lay their wreaths at the Cenotaph. He trusted that the demonstration would cause offence. But he thought of them as the shock troops of gay liberation, breaching the walls of prejudice in the hope that less daring reinforcements would follow. It would be easier to believe that Tatchell operates in the belief that OutRage! does more good than harm if he showed any sign of understanding the penalties of causing calculated offence. But he refuses even to consider the fears of his gay critics. For Peter Tatchell, the battle seems to have become more important than the victory.

However, in year two, there will be a roll-over effect as these slightly older new drivers qualify. <p>Perhaps, Rob, you would like to see the driving age raised to 50 to reduce collisions? Perhaps we should go all the way and introduce blanket 20mph limits on every road in the country and satellite in-car speed limiters? Perhaps we should reintroduce the man with the red flag walking in front of every car? </p> <p>Of course we all want to improve road safety but that does not mean we have to discriminate against 17-year-olds who can go to war but can't even vote. It is not new drivers aged between 17 and 24 who are disproportionately represented in the accident figures. </p> <p>We must address the problems of new drivers. This proposal discriminates against young women, who have a far better safety record than young men. Drop your opposition on grounds of age and let's work to improve safety for all. </p> <p>Yours, <br> Edmund, <br> Executive director, <br> RAC Foundation </p> <p><b>Dear Edmund,</b><br> Perhaps my first response should be that you should never believe everything you read in the papers. </p> <p>We do need to put road safety into context. Although our roads are supposed to be the safest in Europe, we continue to tolerate 3,420 deaths and 321,000 injuries every year - at a cost to society of around \u00a310bn. A disproportionate number of these are young people, who hold 10% of driving licences yet are involved in 20% of crashes. And every week, we read of the Friday-night car crash involving four or five teenagers. </p> <p>Something has to be done to help this group be better prepared for driving. In theory, you can apply for your driving licence and receive it on your 17th birthday. You can take the theory test on that day and pay for the \"same day results\" service. If you pass, you can ring the Driving Standards Agency and book a practical test for the next day anywhere in the country. </p> <p>On the day after your birthday, you could be holding a full driving licence - but nobody would call you trained or competent. As part of a package of measures, a minimum period of learning is worth considering. It's the rest of the package that we also ought to scrutinise. </p> <p>Yours, <br> Robert, <br> Executive director, <br> Parliamentary advisory council for transport safety</p> <p><b>Dear Robert,</b><br> Let's get back to the point. Should the legal driving age be raised? My reply is still no. Of course we need better training and we need to save more young lives but simply raising the age limit could backfire. </p> <p>The safest young drivers are those with some formal training and long periods of practice, normally with a relative. If you raise the driving age to 18 many teenagers will have left home and will miss out on parental supervision. They will be driving their own cars and will be more prone to peer pressure during those first few months of driving. Seventeen-year-olds are also less likely to drink and drive, as they can't legally buy drinks.</p> <p>We must help prepare all new drivers. Hazard perception and safety awareness should be included in the school curriculum. Excellent clubs like the \"under-17s\" pre-driver training in Malmesbury should be encouraged. </p> <p>There is no evidence to suggest that new drivers need a year between obtaining a provisional licence and taking their test. Many would just take lessons prior to the test. Evidence from abroad doesn't suggest that 18-year-olds are safer than 17-year-olds. Let's educate, not discriminate. </p> <p>Yours, <br> Edmund </p> <p><b>Dear Edmund,</b><br> I think I spy a flaw in your argument. No one is suggesting young people should not start learning at 17. The question is at what age they can pass the test. We have already seen a similar approach taken with motorcycling. You have to pass a compulsory basic training test before going out on the road. The numbers of young motorcyclists killed and injured has fallen dramatically as a result. The real problem now is the 40-plus \"born again\" biker, who buys a BMW and gets killed through ignorance. </p> <p>Where I suspect we agree is that age and experience are key factors in learning driving skills. We can help with experience by providing a wide range of environments in which young people try out driving, and by getting them to learn about hazard perception. </p> <p>There's probably not a lot we can do about the ageing process, except by restricting the circumstances in which people can do unlimited harm. If I may say so, your final sentence is a perfect soundbite, but I don't know that it means anything. The two are surely not incompatible.

They will either be the person who is the first up for charades or the one in meetings who always insists that the group splits up into pairs. Oh, and then you get the person who, while the rest of the pub is mouthing the words to an early 90s hit - let\u2019s say, something by Massive Attack - will stare blankly into the distance: a lot of that stuff didn\u2019t make it to Kyoto, which is where she was teaching English at the time.</p> <p>Teaching English as a Foreign Language, or Tefl (also known as English language teaching, or ELT), has always been a good bet for graduates who happen to have English as their mother tongue and want to travel, learn another language and put off doing a \u201cproper\u201d job for a couple of years. Yet, on their return to Blighty, is the line about \u201ctwo years\u2019 teaching in Malaga\u201d on their CV actually interpreted by potential employers as: \u201cdossing on a beach while drinking San Miguel and smoking Ducados\u201d?</p> <p>And if you do find your heart is in teaching English, is it ever possible to make a go of it, settle down and earn decent money, or will you be condemned to living the life of the eternal rootless student? \u201cIf you\u2019re prepared to go from Sri Lanka to Spain, you can make a go of it. If you come back and go to Brighton and teach for \u00a38.50 per hour, you\u2019d be better off making cappuccinos,\u201d says Melanie Butler, managing editor of the trade paper EL Gazette. \u201cIt\u2019s an industry which 70% of people should leave after a year: they\u2019ve got what they can out of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no obvious career ladder,\u201d says Chris Graham, director of recruitment agency Saxoncourt English Worldwide. \u201cThe drop-out rate is pretty high because the money\u2019s not good. People usually come back to get a \u2018proper\u2019 job, and by that I mean proper money.\u201d</p> <p>Saxoncourt recruits about 600 teachers a year and Mr Graham says you can expect to earn between \u00a3500-\u00a3600 a month in a language school in Poland. In Italy, the salary would be similar, but the cost of living far higher. According to Mr Graham, people who have taught English abroad are often bad at selling their skills on their return to the UK.</p> <p>Yet some teachers are good at selling their skills - and are simply good at selling. Monika Lavery taught in a small school in Vic, Cataluna, at the foothills of the Pyrenees, having done the Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults (Celta) course at International House in Barcelona. She not only learned Catalan in addition to Spanish while living on a farm, but also became interested in the food.</p> <p>\u201cAt Christmas they would be killing pigs and making sausages: as I was the tallest person around I was always asked to hang the sausages from the poles in the cellar,\u201d remembers Ms Lavery. \u201cAll the food was local. It was very inspiring. It was the old-style community which we\u2019ve lost so much of here, although it\u2019s coming back.\u201d</p> <p>On her return to the UK Ms Lavery knew that she wanted to keep up her Spanish and her contact with Spain. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that there was a fascinating future for me as a Tefl teacher and I didn\u2019t seem to be able to get another job in Spain that wasn\u2019t teaching.\u201d Starting with Spanish cheese, Ms Lavery went through the embarrassing procedure of cold-calling people like the cheese buyer at Fortnums at a time when there was hardly any Spanish cheese being sold in the UK.</p> <p>While living with her parents and teaching English part-time to keep the wolf from the door, she came across a particular sheep\u2019s cheese, at a trade fair, which was stored in olive oil and sold in a tin.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the most unbelievable cheese,\u201d she recalls, and it prompted her to go back to Spain to meet Ambrosio, the producer, \u201cwho put passion and soul into cheesemaking\u201d.</p> <p>The cheese in the tin got people like celebrity chef Alastair Little and food expert Simon Hopkinson listening to her. She founded Brindisa (from the Spanish word \u201cBrindis\u201d, which means \u201ccelebratory toast\u201d) in 1988 and today it is the foremost importer of quality Spanish food and ingredients in the UK.</p> <p>Now, with 14 staff and based at the Borough Market in London, Ms Lavery still goes to Spain up to six times a year and has fulfilled her post-teaching dream. \u201cI was driven to do something that would link me with Spain forever. I didn\u2019t really think clearly about what I was doing. It was a huge challenge but I think my sales skills came from teaching.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of an interest in language; of communication in general. You\u2019re always guiding students down a path to learn something or believe something. You also get used to looking people in the eye quite happily: you learn that from standing in front of a class. As for eliciting information - it applies in many other situations.\u201d</p> <p>At the head office of Scope, the UK\u2019s leading disability charity, press &amp; PR Officer Marcella McEvoy has also found that her experience teaching English in Prague helps her in all areas of her work. \u201cIt taught me tenacity,\u201d she explains. \u201cAs a Tefl teacher, there are many moments of humiliation. You learn to develop a very thick skin.\u201d</p> <p>Ms McEvoy believes that determination to make the lessons a success meant that she developed creative skills which she now exercises when devising campaigns for Scope such as Mother, Bump and Baby Month.</p> <p>Having to constantly dream up entertaining lessons is something that any ex-Tefl teacher will remember with either affection or horror. With most English language teaching done in private language schools, if your classrooms start to empty, you can only take it personally. The ability to wing it helps, and many people have the knack of being able to turn up to a lesson with nothing but a handful of Cuisenaire rods - variously coloured wooden sticks used as a teaching aid - in their pocket and a few jokes, games or songs up their sleeves as preparation.</p> <p>Stoical, inventive and daring, they can pull off a perfor mance which would make the likes of Eddie Izzard or Marcel Marceau green with envy. But some people have less than pleasant memories: \u201cI find myself becoming nostalgic about tapas but then I remember the pressure,\u201d says Jill Valentine, who taught in Huelva, Andalucia, for a year.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the constant stress; standing up in front of the class and worrying about it all falling apart.\u201d Ms Valentine is now development manager at the University for Industry in Sheffield, where she is nevertheless still involved in education: she\u2019s responsible for national learning centres.</p> <p>Marcella McEvoy believes that some Tefl techniques always stay with you. \u201cIf I run a workshop I find myself grabbing those pens and drawing pictures on the white board,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m always chopping up lots of bits of paper and making people walk around the room and do silly things.\u201d</p> <p>At International House in London, Roger Hunt is director of teacher training and has been draw ing on white boards and chopping up bits of paper for quite a while. Proving that you can make a career out of ELT, and a successful one at that, Mr Hunt originally went to an affiliated International House school in Alexandria for three months in 1980 and ended up staying for four years. He\u2019s worked in Madrid and Budapest, has written books and travels widely.</p> <p>\u201cLanguage has always been divided up into little bits. It\u2019s a bit like trying to drive a car by learning how to use the accelerator first. In your first driving lesson you\u2019ve got to do everything, even if you don\u2019t do it very well. You\u2019ve got to be immersed in language in an holistic way.\u201d</p> <p>International House was founded in 1953 and now has 120 affili ated schools in more than 30 countries. \u201cI think some people think it\u2019s a young person\u2019s job,\u201d Mr Hunt says. \u201cBut now we get a lot of people applying for our courses who are middle-aged and successful and decided they want to see the world and teach English.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s something you can always go back to. International House offers a Tefl Update course at \u00a3250 for two weeks, should you feel like giving it another go.</p> <p>The experience of living away from your familiar surroundings and being forced to develop both inner resources and outer communication skills can stay with you for ever.</p> <p>For those who attempt to integrate and learn a language fluently, their prospects back in Blighty will increase - provided that they can think laterally enough to convey the benefits of their experience in a convincing way.</p> <p>And if you do get the bug, you can get ahead in ELT. But does it mean that you will always have itchy feet? Mr Hunt has been in London for four years now. \u201cI\u2019m off to Barcelona next month to visit our school there,\u201d he says with a smile.

Maybe I\u2019ll just stay.\u201d The Bell School, 01223-246 644/ www.bell-schools.ac.uk International House, 0171-491 2598/ www. international-house-london.ac.uk; Cambridge EFL exams, 01223-553-355/ www.cambridge-efl.org.uk Saxoncourt, 0171-491-1911/ www.saxon.court.comEL Gazette/ EL Prospects, 0171-255-1969/www.elgazette.com VSO, 020-8780-7500 www.vso.org.uk Brindisa, 0171-403-0282; Scope, 0171- 619-7100. On course for a new direction 7,000 people do the Celta course each year but 20%-30% of people do the course then decide not to teach. 30%-50% of the people doing Celta at the Bell School are going into ELT as a career change. Greece has the biggest ELT market in the world while Poland is the fastest growing. Industry experts predict that the demand for English Language Teaching in China could be \u201cinsatiable\u201d. At International House, if you are over 30, resident in the UK and receiving no other form of funding, you are eligible for a discount of 23% on the tuition fees for the Celta course. 51 UK institutions offer EL-related MAs. Jobs in ELT are advertised in EL Prospects, the Times Educational Supplement and the Guardian on Tuesdays. VSO offers yearly renewable ELT contracts in Laos, Cambodia, Kenya, Zambia, Vietnam and Mongolia.",

      "body": "<p>Why are movies growing longer? Why has every visit to the cinema become a test of buttock fortitude? Why is our film going patience being stretched liked a bungee cord tied to a bridge-jumper's ankle? Simply to go to a film now, you have to ask a neighbour to water your plants and walk your dog while you're gone. You have to mark it on your calendar, shift meal plans, dress comfortably, as if you were going into a six-month hypersleep. </p> <p>Sometimes packing a small bag seems appropriate - a change of underwear, canned food, some salt tablets. A movie isn't simply a movie any more; it's a crusade. It's easy to be outraged - one of our pre-eminent forms of public entertainment is being slowly morphed into an ordeal akin to attending all-day lecture seminars or the entire Ring cycle, and so who can blame us for growing resentful? </p> <p>If I added up the excess time I spent sitting in a movie theatre in 1999, there's about 36 hours I would, if I could, happily tack on to the end of my life. I'd like that time back, frankly, and if I tally up the hours from the last few years' maddening overruns, and the overruns sure to come in the next few, I've got approximately a week and a half coming to me. It'll make a difference when I'm 80, that's for sure, and all I'll have then as recompense are active fantasies about assassinating David Lean. </p> <p>Of course, Lean is long dead, and Lean's films usually justified their hyper-extended length. (Then again, couldn't you, with a pair of dull scissors, tighten Doctor Zhivago up so it takes less than three hours to endure?) </p> <p>Lean didn't even pioneer the Long Movie - DW Griffith practically invented feature films by letting The Birth Of A Nation run for over three hours. So the impulse to ravage the audience's gluteus maximus has always been there. </p> <p>But except for Lean and hothouse berserkers like Gone With The Wind (clocking in at a few minutes shy of four hours), long movies were rare. Extreme length was usually reserved for epics (a genre often hellishly dull at any length) and adaptations of novels so well-read and beloved (ie GWTW), that leaving large chunks of it out would have sparked riots in the streets. It should be noted that the normative length for movies ever since Griffith got over his gigantism in 1916 has been anywhere between 90 minutes and two hours. </p> <p>There are good reasons for this: after two hours of sitting in the dark, we get hungry (this was solved early on with concessions), our bodies get restless, the clothes we're wearing (unless we went in pyjamas) begin to chafe, our bladders beg for release, our eyes begin to strain. Still, the most vital industry reason why films have always normally adhered to the 90-120 minute spread was booking - theatre-owners could squeeze in more showings of a film per day. </p> <p>Apparently, these factors don't concern Hollywood any more. Just a cursory glance over the mainstream films released in 1999 is a chilling experience in watching your life's precious minutes disappear into the abyss. The Green Mile and Magnolia both run a brutal three hours, eight minutes, as if the former had been based on Tolstoy instead of Stephen King, and as if the latter didn't need to be winnowed down to the relatively modest length of, say, Nashville. Stanley Kubrick made sure we felt every one of the 159 minutes of Eyes Wide Shut, whereas Topsy-Turvy (160) and The Insider (155) are thoughtfully entertaining despite the fact that both needed to diet off 15 or 20 minutes before seeing the light of day. Titus came in at two hours, 42 minutes, despite the fact that even Anthony Hopkins seemed very aware that the ideal length was exactly zero. </p> <p>No one could be surprised that Luc Besson's The Messenger and Chen Kaige's The Emperor And The Assassin both ramble on for two hours, 40 minutes, but did Fight Club (139), Random Hearts (133), The Matrix (136), The Cider House Rules (131), Ride With The Devil (138) or The Talented Mr Ripley (139) have to be so damn long? A film-maker would, we'd hope, need a very good reason to breach the two-hour barrier, so what justification could one imagine for 8MM, American Beauty, The Mummy, Limbo, Cradle Will Rock and Snow Falling On Cedars all being well over 120 minutes long? What industry-wide derangement is responsible for the running times of Summer Of Sam (141), Angela's Ashes (145) and Anna And The King (147)? Haven't we had quite enough, before the films were even made, of Spike Lee, Frank McCourt and that stupid white-girl-in-Siam story? </p> <p>Likewise, 1998 movies as disparate as The General, Pleasantville, Lolita, Enemy Of The State and The Apostle all dipped deep into that third hour. If you wanted to compare and contrast the second world war epics Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, it meant spending virtually the length of an entire work day, minus lunch, to do so. Shakespeare In Love, which endearingly overshadowed them all, racked up a relatively modest 122 minutes, for which few can hold a grudge. Consider that if we were talking about ages past, every one of these movies would have been hammered into bearable length. </p> <p>In fact, a number of them were: The Talented Mr Ripley was made with a great deal more wit and suspense, and with 20 less minutes, by the French in 1960. Ride With The Devil is not unlike any number of normally-civil war dramas, like 1940's Dark Command, which is 92 minutes long. Random Hearts fails to do what any Douglas Sirk movie does, and at a 30% mark-up in running time. Any Given Sunday runs through the same football-is-hell clich\u008es as North Dallas Forty, but with an entire extra hour of montages. The original 1932 version of The Mummy is a brisk 72 minutes long. Of course, Angela's Ashes, Eyes Wide Shut, The Insider, Fight Club and Summer Of Sam wouldn't have been made at all. </p> <p>The reason for this cinerrhoea is probably a combination of the usual suspects: the freedom allotted to film-makers by digital editing, a runaway sense of egomanic self-indulgence, and a misguided marketing notion that audiences paying high ticket prices want a lot of movie for their money. All we can say for certain is that when it comes to movie length, less is indisputably more. </p> <p>Like all cultural forms with a fixed temporal length, movies are more than just the sum of their materials - they are, as well, the experience of having to endure those materials. The length of that experience is just as vital an aesthetic issue as theme and execution. If it's misjudged, a promising film can become a trial. Even the best of films, and the best of filmic ingredients, can wear on you like a grinder's wheel if they go on for too long. Nowadays, a film that attains depth and breadth and does so in under two hours (like Neil Jordan's The End Of The Affair) are the truffles in the filmgoer's search for delicacies. Movies that come in at 90 minutes or - God forbid - shorter are things of beauty.</p> <p>\u0095 The Green Mile is out next Friday</p>",

A film-maker would, we'd hope, need a very good reason to breach the two-hour barrier, so what justification could one imagine for 8MM, American Beauty, The Mummy, Limbo, Cradle Will Rock and Snow Falling On Cedars all being well over 120 minutes long? What industry-wide derangement is responsible for the running times of Summer Of Sam (141), Angela's Ashes (145) and Anna And The King (147)? Haven't we had quite enough, before the films were even made, of Spike Lee, Frank McCourt and that stupid white-girl-in-Siam story? Likewise, 1998 movies as disparate as The General, Pleasantville, Lolita, Enemy Of The State and The Apostle all dipped deep into that third hour. If you wanted to compare and contrast the second world war epics Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, it meant spending virtually the length of an entire work day, minus lunch, to do so. Shakespeare In Love, which endearingly overshadowed them all, racked up a relatively modest 122 minutes, for which few can hold a grudge. Consider that if we were talking about ages past, every one of these movies would have been hammered into bearable length. In fact, a number of them were: The Talented Mr Ripley was made with a great deal more wit and suspense, and with 20 less minutes, by the French in 1960. Ride With The Devil is not unlike any number of normally-civil war dramas, like 1940's Dark Command, which is 92 minutes long. Random Hearts fails to do what any Douglas Sirk movie does, and at a 30% mark-up in running time. Any Given Sunday runs through the same football-is-hell clich\u008es as North Dallas Forty, but with an entire extra hour of montages. The original 1932 version of The Mummy is a brisk 72 minutes long. Of course, Angela's Ashes, Eyes Wide Shut, The Insider, Fight Club and Summer Of Sam wouldn't have been made at all. The reason for this cinerrhoea is probably a combination of the usual suspects: the freedom allotted to film-makers by digital editing, a runaway sense of egomanic self-indulgence, and a misguided marketing notion that audiences paying high ticket prices want a lot of movie for their money. All we can say for certain is that when it comes to movie length, less is indisputably more. Like all cultural forms with a fixed temporal length, movies are more than just the sum of their materials - they are, as well, the experience of having to endure those materials. The length of that experience is just as vital an aesthetic issue as theme and execution. If it's misjudged, a promising film can become a trial. Even the best of films, and the best of filmic ingredients, can wear on you like a grinder's wheel if they go on for too long. Nowadays, a film that attains depth and breadth and does so in under two hours (like Neil Jordan's The End Of The Affair) are the truffles in the filmgoer's search for delicacies. Movies that come in at 90 minutes or - God forbid - shorter are things of beauty. \u0095 The Green Mile is out next Friday",

When he's content with the role of observer, he writes prose as well as Charles Bukowski or Raymond Carver, with exceptional clarity and lyricism as well as with a strong, communicated sense of the spatial solidity of objects and the clatter and untidiness of people. </p> <p>Mamet made his name writing plays about small-time urban low-life types inhabiting the no man's land between business and crime. He loved their corrupt, swaggering verbal glitter, their peacock-male sense of being street-smart and wised-up; and he was fascinated by the rules and rituals they lived by, their sense of macho honour and their fear of betrayal. </p> <p>In his early work the conversations felt as if they'd been overheard in bars or on street corners, transcribed and then somehow heightened. Mamet's skill was to take this material and shape it, to place his characters in contexts where their frustration and anger and sheer vitality had wider dramatic implications - where masculinity crossed the borderline into psychosis. He could elevate the coiled aggressions of people who don't trust each other into a hypnotic verbal poetry, full of violent psychological resonance. </p> <p>It was a gift Hollywood quickly learnt how to use. Because Mamet possessed a magnetic ability to capture and then unleash the unstable, irregular rhythms of a voice, he wrote rewardingly for big-name heavyweight actors. Jack Nicholson in The Postman Always Rings Twice and Paul Newman in The Verdict both drew a dilating intensity and sense of obsession from his writing; in The Untouchables Sean Connery won an Oscar speaking his lines. Not until Quentin Tarantino came along did anybody write screen dialogue that crackled quite like Mamet's, yet which also had such a lustre of high cultural self-awareness. </p> <p>Self-consciousness is an essential part of what Mamet does. Even in prose form, his dialogue is a fusion of opposites. It's very pared down, very sculpted; yet it also bursts with life, with a profane energy and speed. You don't read, you hear. As in this, from a piece called \"Cops and Cars\" in Jafsie and John Henry , where the young Mamet, working as a taxi driver, is hit by a patrol car: \"The cop jumped out of his car, all solicitude. 'Jeez', he said, 'are you okay? I wasn't looking. I took the corner too fast, Are you okay? I'm sorry...' \" Of course, the words don't really mean what they say. The cop books him anyway. </p> <p>Mamet has always been fascinated by the structure of language, the way rhythm and repetition can communicate what words themselves don't or can't. There are times when one seriously doubts whether he has a subject other than aesthetics, beyond locating a kind of formal beauty in patterns of speech and the cadences of prose, or, on a larger scale, in the persistent half-sinister, half-predictable symmetry of events. </p> <p>\"Cops and Cars\", the brevity of which functions sardonically as an attitude, shows off his sense of patterning. It begins with Mamet at street level, taking the rap. It ends, a lifetime later but only two blocks away, with Mamet, now internationally famous, directing a movie - and, because of a problem with the weather, urgently needing to clear a street of cars several hours earlier than he's asked the police to schedule. \"The street had been posted for days with a sign which read, 'Such-and-such-a-date, this street closed from (here, in a blank, was written NOON) - any cars found past this time will be towed.' The head of our police escort listened, as we wrung our hands, took out a magic marker, crossed out the word NOON and wrote in DAWN, and towed the cars.\" </p> <p>Mamet's writing finds its meaning through such epiphanies, distilling their significance into an angry, stinging shrewdness. In his world, everything comes down to having the inner dope. It's why one of his most richly achieved screen creations was the seen-it-all Irish cop Malone, played in The Untouchables by Sean Connery: entertainingly dour and trigger-happy in a Howard Hawks Western way, he also spoke in terse, antithetical sentences; we felt we were being addressed by a patriarch. </p> <p>It's easy, reading Mamet's prose, to see where the crazy, elegised voices in his drama come from. The essays in Jafsie and John Henry show how he loves to put an ancient, almost scriptural spin on the language of observation. In \"Six Hours Of Perfect Poker\" - most of which is a vividly concrete evocation of the adrenalin addiction of the game - we encounter high-aspiring parentheses such as this: \"It is my experience in the analysis of dreams, as in the constructing of Drama (which is nothing other than an inversion of the process), that it is invariably the overlooked, the seemingly innocuous, the dismissed 'connective' term, which is the clue to the mystery.\" </p> <p>This attitude, this inflection, is one very familiar from Mamet's dramatic writing - the voice of the old-timer, the One Who Knows, sitting in a bar with a drink or two inside him, imparting nuggets of wisdom to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. It has a dominating authority, a wonderful bright-burning paranoia, but it's hardly surprising that the positions it adopts are contradictory and self-defeating. Objective truth adjusts itself to the flow of rhetoric. </p> <p>One essay, \"Noach\", is a baroque but compelling attack on conformity in stacked-up, Mailerish language - \"we can see the very exuberance engendered by solidarity as a tool diagnostic of arrogance and the cruelty to which it leads\", Mamet thunders. Then, a few pages later, in a piece called \"Poor but Happy\", he's saying the opposite - suggesting a solution to the disease of American anti-semitism by exhorting his readers to \"proclaim and, so, to enjoy one's membership of the group\". </p> <p>You don't read Mamet for wisdom, because he doesn't possess it. When he tries to be wise he just gets tanked up on his own grand metaphysics. \"What causes race hatred?\" he shouts at us. \"It is caused by self-loathing.\" Does he seriously believe that the Nuremberg rallies were exercises in self-hatred? That the iniquities of the slave trade were caused by low self-esteem? </p> <p>I like Mamet best when the part of him that sounds like a scolding Freudian rabbi is not in the ascendant. In essays on whisky-tasting, sheath knives, deer hunting, he has a kind of perfect pitch. He writes better about the world of non-sexual sense impressions - the taste of Scotch, the weight of a rifle, the smell of a forest - than anyone since Ian Fleming. He's strongest when he's earthed and practical. </p> <p> Which is probably why I found his \"experimental\" novel, Wilson: A Consideration of The Sources, virtually unreadable. The book posits a future internet crash in which the entire collective memory of the 21st century is erased and the past has to be recreated from the textual fragments which survive, some of which are (or appear to be) the memories of the wife of ex-President Woodrow Wilson.</p> <p>The result is a bombastic patchwork of recondite jokes, verbal games and puns, padded out with slabs of parody or pastiche and governed not by narrative but by an overbearing impenetrability of tone. It has a theme of sorts - \"We have been raised to think of the past as 'what happened'. The 'past' is merely our idea of what happened\" - and moments of lucidity, when Mamet's disorganised, hectoring style snaps into focus and becomes poetic. </p> <p>It doesn't matter that it doesn't work. Mamet has never pretended to be a long-haul writer and sees time the way the early Elizabethans did, as a destroyer. His best work points us, often brutally fast, to endings which are not intended to console. As for the grandiose way he sometimes writes - the hard-nosed pontifications - he probably feels it's an authority he's earned. He reminds me a little of the US army officer in Michael Herr's Dispatches, to whose elaborate military schemes the only truthful answer was, \"Colonel, you're insane.\" But his voice - when it's telling us what he feels, not what to think - has enormous power to compel.</p>",

But as she slowly recovers, the necessity of a total reinvention of self begins to seem more appealing than appalling. </p> <p>So goes the basic premise of Mary Morrissy's second novel. But rather than create an entirely fictional surround for such an intriguing psychodrama, Morrissy has drawn on an extremely well-known, not to say notorious, example of delusion and self-creation. In The Pretender she explores the possible origins of Anna Anderson, the woman who claimed until her death in 1984 to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia. </p> <p>Whether one supported or dismissed Anderson's claims, the true story is fascinating. It revolves around the possibility that when the Romanov family were shot by their captors in 1918, one or even two of their children survived the gunfire and bayonets. The plot thickened when, a few years later, \"Anna Anderson\" appeared in the United States and declared herself to be Anastasia. She produced witnesses who recognised her from childhood, waving away her apparent inability to speak Russian. After her death, DNA tests on her hair proved \"conclusively\" (her acolytes, of course, counter that the tests were rigged) that she wasn't related to the Romanovs. </p> <p>Who was she, then? One line of investigation suggests that she might have been Franziska Schanzkowska, a Polish country-girl who worked in a munitions factory in Berlin during the first world war, where she sustained injuries consistent with the bullets and bayonet story, and from where she suddenly disappeared. Accepting the likely truth of this theory, Morrissy creates a fictional past for Schanzkowska. Her novel, which touches on Anna Anderson little save for atmospheric first and final chapters, is concerned with creating a set of psychological circumstances disturbing enough to be consistent with the personality of the long-term impostor. </p> <p>The novel has undoubted strengths and inevitable weaknesses. Perhaps the greatest concern is the most obvious; that the author appears to be constrained by the limits of her ambitious project. She must continually be laying down markers for the attentive reader. Have we, for example, noticed that Franziska's father always called her Princess, at least until her baby brother was born? That, as an impoverished runaway, she dreamed of somehow getting to America? That the existence of the adored younger brother parallels the presumed real-life relationship between Anastasia and Alexei? The themes that interest Morrissy - childhood trauma and dislocation, sibling rivalry, the constant yearning for escape - lack the room to breathe when they are projected onto the larger canvas. </p> <p>Far-fetched facts do not always demand far-fetched fiction, and Morrissy is at her best when observing and depicting more generalised scenes and atmospheres. Her description of the asylum in which Franziska first finds herself after her suicide attempt is stunningly good, full of vividly realised portraits of the unhinged and dispossessed and infused with a chilling sense of an enclosed world. She is acute, too, on wartime Berlin, and on the attempts of its embattled citizens to survive. </p> <p>And yet too much of the story is missing, despite Morrissy's valiant efforts to fill in the gaps. We see the beginning of transformation and its sad, lonely end, but very little of what went on in between. What was it like to live in someone else's skin for over 60 years? To be engulfed in a manic delusion so outrageous that it gripped the world? These are tough, if not impossible, questions to answer, but they are the heart of Anna Anderson's story.

      "body": "<p>When I was a boy, my great uncle, Lord Alfred Douglas - or Bosie, as he was known - was just the photograph of a beautiful young man in a dusty old book of his poetry. I loved, and still love, the soaring, Shakespearean line and musical quality to his poems; they beg to be read aloud - which is why I have recorded a CD of them. I felt I had to do something to re-establish his reputation, still completely dominated by his relationship with Oscar Wilde. </p> <p>As a child I knew nothing of the affair, which started after they met for tea at Wilde's house in Tite Street, Chelsea, in 1891. I doubt if any innocent event has ever had quite such dramatic repercussions, for it was to result in a scandal that rocked Victorian society and ruined both participants. Bosie's father, the ninth Marquess of Queensbury, accused Wilde of sodomy; Wilde sued for libel, lost his case and was himself prosecuted for homosexuality. However Bosie and Wilde's love, for so it was, survived trial, tragedy and disgrace, until Wilde's death in France in 1900. </p> <p>\"Your slim gilt soul walks between passion and poetry\", Wilde wrote to Lord Alfred once. Bosie began writing in his undergraduate days in Oxford before he met Wilde, and his first serious poem, Autumn Days, appeared in The Oxford magazine in 1890. His first collection, simply called Poems, was published in France in 1896 during Wilde's imprisonment, and in 1899 an anonymous English edition of his work was a huge success. His poetry remained in print for the rest of his life. He wrote mainly sonnets in the strict Petrarchan style, but also some fine lyrics, satires, and amusing nonsense rhymes, Tails with a Twist, which were a model for Hilaire Belloc's Bad Child's Book of Beasts. </p> <p>Poetry gleams like a silver thread through the dark history of the Douglas line, a curious distillation of beauty from bloodshed. The poetry comes from Gavin Douglas, the 16th-century bishop, one of Scotland's greatest poets, who translated Virgil's Aeneid from Latin to Gaelic, and William Douglas, who wrote the words to the song Annie Lawrie. Even Bosie's own brutish, thuggish father had poetry in his soul. His will stated that he should be buried \"in any place where stars shall ever shed their light, and sun still gild each rising morn_\" This from the man who tyrannised his wife (Bosie abhorred the mental cruelty he visited upon her), and cared more about his horses and his dogs than he did his own children. Bosie, when young, had revered his father's manliness - a fine boxer, the marquess devised the Queensbury rules that are still in use today. But the rift between them, fuelled by their famously insolent correspondence (Bosie once sent a telegram to his father calling him \"a silly little man\") was healed only shortly before Queensbury's death. And nothing could make up for the wasted years. </p> <p>\"The mad, bad line\", Wilde had written about us. How right he was. Barbarity runs thick in the Douglas blood. There was William Douglas, one of the two Black Douglases of tradition who died in 1390. \"Hush thee hush thee, dinna fret thee lest the Black Douglas come and get thee,\" was a refrain handed down by lowland Scottish families. James, his cousin, the other Black Douglas, was entrusted to take Robert the Bruce's heart in a silver casket to the Holy Land, to fulfil a vow to visit Jerusalem that the king could not keep while he was alive. James didn't make it either; he was hacked to death defending Christ in Spain. He died with ineffable courage, flinging the casket ahead of him when death was inevitable, with a wild battle cry: \"Now pass onward as thou were wont, and Douglas will follow thee or die!\" </p> <p>There could be a predisposition for human flesh in our family. His namesake, James, third Marquess of Queensbury, whose nickname was \"the cannibalistic idiot\", escaped in 1707 from his cell into the the kitchens of Holyrood Palace, where he seized a cookboy, killed him and roasted him on a spit before the fire. I wonder if poor Wilde had any idea what he was dealing with. Even Bosie's own son Raymond was deranged and spent much of his life in confinement. Once, when released from his institution to come out to lunch with my father, he attempted to throw the chambermaid out of the window. </p> <p>But along with this daunting heritage came qualities of courage and loyalty. Bosie was the only one to stick with Wilde at the time of his trial, when most upper-class gays were fleeing the country to avoid the scandal. </p> <p>As I grew older and became a teenager, gradually I learnt more about Bosie. About the bad boy who had ruined Wilde. About the loss of the family's vast Scottish estates and huge fortune, more or less as a result of the bitter family rift between the marquess and his sons over the Wilde affair. Queensbury had been so maddened by Bosie's behaviour and the support given him by Percy, his other son, that he took no care over the settlement of his wealth on future generations. As a result the estates were sold and the entire fortune left to Percy, a hopeless speculator who lost the lot, about \u00a3300,000, in one year. My father was fond of remarking that all he had inherited from the whole debacle were the keys to the family graveyard. </p> <p>Those were the stories. I was more interested in the poetry. I started to learn and recite the poems as my father, Francis Queensbury, had done before me. He was famous for his recitations at such places as Leeds Castle and Blenheim Palace. He had a fabulous voice and a unique style, and delivered Bosie's sonnets with a growling, stentorian grandeur. </p> <p>Bosie and I connect. I am a pianist and singer and so was he; it is my profession, and was his hobby - though he was asked to play the chapel organ, while serving time in Wormwood Scrubs (he was sentenced to six months for libelling Winston Churchill). Bosie fought his battles not in the fields of Spain, but in the courtrooms of England where he proved a ferocious litigant. He also wrote one of his finest works, In Excelsis, in prison. </p> <p>The poetry ranges from lines of passion and intensity: (\"You were a brute and more than half a knave/ Your mind was seamed with labyrinthine tracks/ Wherein walked crazy moods bending their backs/ Under grim loads\" - The Unspeakable Englishman) to delicate fancy and romance (\"Alas that Time should war against distress/ And numb the sweet ache of remembered loss/ And give for sorrow's gold the indifferent dross/ Of calm regret or stark forgetfulness_\"). The latter comes from a sonnet written about Wilde after his death. </p> <p>I love Bosie's contrary nature. His rigid adherence to an antique style of sonnet writing and his defiance of convention certainly make him an exceptional 20th-century figure. He was once highly regarded, gaining a place in the Oxford Book of English Verse. His poems, with their rigour and diamond-like strength, as clear and sharp as frost, should fascinate us today. </p> <p>Perhaps I can put Lord Alfred back on the bookshelf now. </p> <p>\u0095 To order a copy of the CD Poems of Lord Alfred Douglas Recited by Lord Gawain Douglas, price \u00a312.99, call 01304 375813.

Poetry gleams like a silver thread through the dark history of the Douglas line, a curious distillation of beauty from bloodshed. The poetry comes from Gavin Douglas, the 16th-century bishop, one of Scotland's greatest poets, who translated Virgil's Aeneid from Latin to Gaelic, and William Douglas, who wrote the words to the song Annie Lawrie. Even Bosie's own brutish, thuggish father had poetry in his soul. His will stated that he should be buried \"in any place where stars shall ever shed their light, and sun still gild each rising morn_\" This from the man who tyrannised his wife (Bosie abhorred the mental cruelty he visited upon her), and cared more about his horses and his dogs than he did his own children. Bosie, when young, had revered his father's manliness - a fine boxer, the marquess devised the Queensbury rules that are still in use today. But the rift between them, fuelled by their famously insolent correspondence (Bosie once sent a telegram to his father calling him \"a silly little man\") was healed only shortly before Queensbury's death. And nothing could make up for the wasted years. \"The mad, bad line\", Wilde had written about us. How right he was. Barbarity runs thick in the Douglas blood. There was William Douglas, one of the two Black Douglases of tradition who died in 1390. \"Hush thee hush thee, dinna fret thee lest the Black Douglas come and get thee,\" was a refrain handed down by lowland Scottish families. James, his cousin, the other Black Douglas, was entrusted to take Robert the Bruce's heart in a silver casket to the Holy Land, to fulfil a vow to visit Jerusalem that the king could not keep while he was alive. James didn't make it either; he was hacked to death defending Christ in Spain. He died with ineffable courage, flinging the casket ahead of him when death was inevitable, with a wild battle cry: \"Now pass onward as thou were wont, and Douglas will follow thee or die!\" There could be a predisposition for human flesh in our family. His namesake, James, third Marquess of Queensbury, whose nickname was \"the cannibalistic idiot\", escaped in 1707 from his cell into the the kitchens of Holyrood Palace, where he seized a cookboy, killed him and roasted him on a spit before the fire. I wonder if poor Wilde had any idea what he was dealing with. Even Bosie's own son Raymond was deranged and spent much of his life in confinement. Once, when released from his institution to come out to lunch with my father, he attempted to throw the chambermaid out of the window. But along with this daunting heritage came qualities of courage and loyalty. Bosie was the only one to stick with Wilde at the time of his trial, when most upper-class gays were fleeing the country to avoid the scandal. As I grew older and became a teenager, gradually I learnt more about Bosie. About the bad boy who had ruined Wilde. About the loss of the family's vast Scottish estates and huge fortune, more or less as a result of the bitter family rift between the marquess and his sons over the Wilde affair. Queensbury had been so maddened by Bosie's behaviour and the support given him by Percy, his other son, that he took no care over the settlement of his wealth on future generations. As a result the estates were sold and the entire fortune left to Percy, a hopeless speculator who lost the lot, about \u00a3300,000, in one year. My father was fond of remarking that all he had inherited from the whole debacle were the keys to the family graveyard. Those were the stories. I was more interested in the poetry. I started to learn and recite the poems as my father, Francis Queensbury, had done before me. He was famous for his recitations at such places as Leeds Castle and Blenheim Palace. He had a fabulous voice and a unique style, and delivered Bosie's sonnets with a growling, stentorian grandeur. Bosie and I connect. I am a pianist and singer and so was he; it is my profession, and was his hobby - though he was asked to play the chapel organ, while serving time in Wormwood Scrubs (he was sentenced to six months for libelling Winston Churchill). Bosie fought his battles not in the fields of Spain, but in the courtrooms of England where he proved a ferocious litigant. He also wrote one of his finest works, In Excelsis, in prison. The poetry ranges from lines of passion and intensity: (\"You were a brute and more than half a knave/ Your mind was seamed with labyrinthine tracks/ Wherein walked crazy moods bending their backs/ Under grim loads\" - The Unspeakable Englishman) to delicate fancy and romance (\"Alas that Time should war against distress/ And numb the sweet ache of remembered loss/ And give for sorrow's gold the indifferent dross/ Of calm regret or stark forgetfulness_\"). The latter comes from a sonnet written about Wilde after his death. I love Bosie's contrary nature. His rigid adherence to an antique style of sonnet writing and his defiance of convention certainly make him an exceptional 20th-century figure. He was once highly regarded, gaining a place in the Oxford Book of English Verse. His poems, with their rigour and diamond-like strength, as clear and sharp as frost, should fascinate us today. Perhaps I can put Lord Alfred back on the bookshelf now. \u0095 To order a copy of the CD Poems of Lord Alfred Douglas Recited by Lord Gawain Douglas, price \u00a312.99, call 01304 375813.

This droll writer (her tone is a little like Jane Austen's letters) records what solos from 19 to 90-something say - hardly a word of it psychobabble or victimspeak; no whinges, no self-deprecation, much rude humour. Shrewd, too. We adore her summary of the great American romance with solitude, in which traditionally only a man got to be lonely and free: \"Have you ever seen a tumbleweed follow a lone woman rider?\" </p> <p> <strong> Broadway Babies Say Goodnight</strong>&lt;BRMark Steyn <br>Faber, \u00a39.99<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501944660,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Steyn loves, too: he loves the Broadway musical; only he doesn't love Stephen Sondheim because Mr S will never unconditionally write \"I love you\", which refusal makes a lie of all the declarations of love and hope that sustained Broadway. Sometimes the wisecracks crackle too fast, so Steyn sounds like gum-snapping showgirl; but mostly the book (in the musical sense) would stage swell: it's got heart, class, rhythm, a perfect little biotuner of the life of Irving Berlin (or why White Christmas has traditional Jewish connotations and tragic personal ones). And an intermission. Do not read in public places, because you are certain to sing along. </p> <p> <strong> The Medieval Surgery</strong><br>Tony Hunt<br>Boydell, \u00a312.99 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502300828,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> After all that love, some pain: Roger of Parma's 1180 treatise on surgery, with a crisply professional commentary. The swollen right cheek of a wretch in a tunic is a \"an indication of mandibular dislocation\"; a grim scene in which a patient clutches the shins of a doctor who, with forceps, is \"neutralising the barbs\" before extracting an arrow. We suspect medical humour in the line \"the patient appears comfortable\", describing the wide-eyed face of a medieval man watching as his slit-open belly is stitched up. A foul world: scrofulas, fistulas and cranial fractures - any casualty on a bad Saturday night, except that no doctor here runs by the trolley; he sits on a kingly chair and pronounces.</p>",

Amidon uses this device cunningly, setting up a little crisis at a chapter's end and then rewinding the tape to start a few hours earlier, through different eyes. We know what's coming, but not why: a constant frisson of suspense. Amidon's choice of free indirect style over first-person narration, meanwhile, maintains a distance that allows him to soak sentiments in wrenching irony: he is superb at showing decent men deceiving themselves. \"Swope was not vindictive,\" we are told, as Swope wades ever deeper into a meticulous vengeance. </p> <p>All right, so this is a big American novel. But is it a Big American Novel? Well, the new city is of course America, the start-from-scratch dream of land, freedom and brotherhood. Then you have race, 'Nam, rock music, teenagers and the law. And Amidon scores his epic with gently tolling symbolism: the fish in the new lake knowingly turn belly-up, and Teddy gives his father a Newton's cradle, which pictures at once a predictable cosmic order and an Old Testament vengeance: knock something and it comes back at you just as hard. </p> <p>But a BAN ought to teem with plurally imagined life, and the people outside Amidon's privileged circle of quasi-narrators do not seem quite real. Joel is unfathomable: Teddy's devotion to him is something for which we are given excuses rather than reasons. Swope's wife wafts around ethereally to no apparent purpose, and Susan's mother Irma Truax is a nutty Kraut stereotype. There is also a slightly reticent sheen to the prose. The funniest line, \"The county magistrate entered the chamber like a small mammal looking for food\", sticks out as a rare moment of imaginative levity. </p> <p>This fascinating novel is perhaps, in the end, too careful. The last 100 pages are horrifically gripping, and yet at the last the novel seems to stop rather than to finish. Amidon's decision to deny readers the most obvious continuation, a courtroom thriller, is a brave one. But a more shameless thriller writer would certainly have reversed the linear narrative, and begun the story with this book's climax of murder and arrest. After all, Amidon spends 450 pages dramatising how cool, deliberate planning can degenerate into atavistic chaos. Maybe he should have gone for the jugular.</p>",

      "trailText": "<p>Charles Allen tells John Cunningham about his quest for Shangr-La</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Life was fine for Charles Allen when he was recording the memories of old colonials in India, Africa and Malaysia. Presented first as BBC radio documentaries, then packaged into books, the series - Plain Tales from the Raj, The Dark Continent and The South China Seas - were based on a simple formula. </p> <p>It worked for years, made Allen's name as an oral historian and licensed him to poke over the embers of empire. His father was the sixth generation of Allens to serve the Raj. Charles inherited the colonial gene but, as a leftie student, had to find a different, distanced way of using it. </p> <p>He's had his ups and downs since the 10 good years of the Plain Tales, but now, in his 50s, three constants in his work have come together in his book about Tibet: his addictions to Asia, mountains and unfashionable causes. </p> <p>The book is about his search for Shangri-La; the name was coined in a 1930s novel, The Lost Horizon, by James Hilton, but it came to be attached to a legendary bit of paradise on earth, hidden away beyond the Himalayas in western Tibet. </p> <p>Allen's own attempts to get there didn't quite succeed, and now he says he might never be able to go back. From the sanctuary of the British Library, which he uses as research base and semi-club when in London, Allen confides: \"I'm an awful traveller. I'm constantly sick; I can't stand Indian food and I've lost part of one lung.\" </p> <p>In spite of this, he looks totally robust, and his dogged approach to research is intact - that's why he's in the BL, the London building that, ironically, most resembles a Tibetan temple - working on another book on the sub-continent. </p> <p>Allen is an amalgam of classic traveller - hoping to discover an unexplored or lost destination - and wayward expert, clinging to a theory that academics revile. It's like being harangued by Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, but thankfully Allen has the redeeming ability to admit the shortcomings of his quest, while maintaining his belief in his basic premise. This, as he explains over a calming cup of Earl Grey in the BL caff, is that underneath Tibet's Buddhist culture lies an older, shadowy religion, known as Bon, which also preceded the Hinduism and Jainism of the region. Allen is keen to point this up because from the heartland of Bon came the idea of a perfect paradise - Shambhala. </p> <p>He explains that he'd overlooked the Bon civilisation when he wrote an earlier book on the region in 1981. This was A Mountain in Tibet, about Mount Kailas, the fabled site sacred to Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. </p> <p>\"I got it all wrong\", he says. However in 1996 and 97, he made return journeys to try to find Shambhala. He was wiser in some ways, but not in others. A meal of rancid buffalo meat nearly scuppered the expedition. He met a Bonbo abbot who said the ancient, abandoned capital city of Kyunglung was only a day's hike off. But it eluded him, and he was cheated again when he returned with a TV crew in 1998. </p> <p>\"I'll always regret not making the extra effort and pushing on, but we had already run out of funds and time,\" he says. The team was almost on the outskirts of the decayed capital city of the little paradise. </p> <p>\"If we'd been allowed half a day more, we'd have discovered something really radical. We'd have got into the complex of caves and temples.

      "bodyText": "Life was fine for Charles Allen when he was recording the memories of old colonials in India, Africa and Malaysia. Presented first as BBC radio documentaries, then packaged into books, the series - Plain Tales from the Raj, The Dark Continent and The South China Seas - were based on a simple formula. It worked for years, made Allen's name as an oral historian and licensed him to poke over the embers of empire. His father was the sixth generation of Allens to serve the Raj. Charles inherited the colonial gene but, as a leftie student, had to find a different, distanced way of using it. He's had his ups and downs since the 10 good years of the Plain Tales, but now, in his 50s, three constants in his work have come together in his book about Tibet: his addictions to Asia, mountains and unfashionable causes. The book is about his search for Shangri-La; the name was coined in a 1930s novel, The Lost Horizon, by James Hilton, but it came to be attached to a legendary bit of paradise on earth, hidden away beyond the Himalayas in western Tibet. Allen's own attempts to get there didn't quite succeed, and now he says he might never be able to go back. From the sanctuary of the British Library, which he uses as research base and semi-club when in London, Allen confides: \"I'm an awful traveller. I'm constantly sick; I can't stand Indian food and I've lost part of one lung.\" In spite of this, he looks totally robust, and his dogged approach to research is intact - that's why he's in the BL, the London building that, ironically, most resembles a Tibetan temple - working on another book on the sub-continent. Allen is an amalgam of classic traveller - hoping to discover an unexplored or lost destination - and wayward expert, clinging to a theory that academics revile. It's like being harangued by Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, but thankfully Allen has the redeeming ability to admit the shortcomings of his quest, while maintaining his belief in his basic premise. This, as he explains over a calming cup of Earl Grey in the BL caff, is that underneath Tibet's Buddhist culture lies an older, shadowy religion, known as Bon, which also preceded the Hinduism and Jainism of the region. Allen is keen to point this up because from the heartland of Bon came the idea of a perfect paradise - Shambhala. He explains that he'd overlooked the Bon civilisation when he wrote an earlier book on the region in 1981. This was A Mountain in Tibet, about Mount Kailas, the fabled site sacred to Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. \"I got it all wrong\", he says. However in 1996 and 97, he made return journeys to try to find Shambhala. He was wiser in some ways, but not in others. A meal of rancid buffalo meat nearly scuppered the expedition. He met a Bonbo abbot who said the ancient, abandoned capital city of Kyunglung was only a day's hike off. But it eluded him, and he was cheated again when he returned with a TV crew in 1998. \"I'll always regret not making the extra effort and pushing on, but we had already run out of funds and time,\" he says. The team was almost on the outskirts of the decayed capital city of the little paradise. \"If we'd been allowed half a day more, we'd have discovered something really radical. We'd have got into the complex of caves and temples. It's like a troglodyte city.\" He's convinced this belongs to the earliest civilisation in Tibet. \"But I can find no other Tibet expert who will back me up on this.\" However, the travel chapters of the Shangri-La book alternate with his summaries of what has been discovered about the beliefs and practices of the Bonpo - followers of a creed which, he believes, could have had its origins in Iran. The hardback wasn't widely reviewed when it appeared last year. Allen reckons that is because other experts don't like him rocking the boat. \"There's been a resounding silence,\" he says. \"It's a bit naughty, the way some of the leading Tibetologists here and in America have trotted out the [previous] Dalai Lama's view of history.\" That gives an essentially seamless account of Buddhism in Tibet. But, Allen reminds them, Buddhists persecuted Bons: \"Tibetan Buddhists are not the good guys in this story.\" Their religion is, he points out, an extraordinary hotch-potch of beliefs, practices, tantric texts, beasties, demons and superstitions. Western academics don't haven't much interest in Tibet - \"it's the poor boy of Asian studies\" - nor in sorting out the layered muddle of religion, culture and politics. Overall, we're too mawkishly sentimental in our attitude to Tibet, Allen concludes. But then he admits that he, too, is just as sentimental; just as hooked on the place. \"It is wonderful, this combination of spirituality and harshness; of people living on the edge of existence who smile when they meet you.\"",

Work in progress in 1875 included a history of 15th-century Florentine art in six volumes, a history of pre-Christian Attic art in three, serial lives of Scott, Xenophon and Hesiod and a \"general description of the geology and botany of the Alps, in 24 volumes\". Neither of his latest biographers, John Batchelor and Tim Hilton, offers a definitive total, but the final computation can't be much under 250 items. </p> <p>Equally difficult, too, not to imagine that this extraordinary torrent of print, an endless inky fountain of lectures, reflections and articles, wasn't somehow a replacement for something else - that the fervour with which Ruskin put pen to paper compensated for the dramatic fractures and absences of his emotional life.</p> <p>As both Batchelor and Hilton show, the latter in relentless detail, Ruskin's acquaintance was a Victorian Who's Who, taking in everyone from Turner to Swinburne, the pre-Raphaelites to William Morris, and yet his solitariness pulses away like a lighthouse beacon. Simultaneously indulged and kept up to the mark by wealthy parents, whose roots in \"trade\" gave him an edgy provincialism that he never quite shook off, he found it perfectly natural that his mother should follow him to Oxford.</p> <p>She despatched wonderfully snobbish letters home about his well-born chums: \"The only thing that occurred during the lecture that will please you particularly\", she informed Ruskin senior, \"was that Ld. March and Ld. Desart came and placed themselves by John, and Ld. March having forgot to bring a pencil asked John if he could lend him one.\" </p> <p>Other pencils - one pushes the metaphor because it seems so intimately bound up with Ruskin's creative sense - were conspicuously short on lead. The marriage to Effie Gray, first picked out as a pre-pubescent 12-year-old, was never consummated (it says something for Ruskin's detachment that when Effie went off with J E Millais, who she met during the sessions for her husband's portrait, Ruskin insisted that the picture be completed).</p> <p>Subsequently, he continued to exhibit the trademark Victorian weakness for young girls and even in old age was capable of proposing marriage to the 18-year-old Kathleen Olander (Miss Olander prudently declined). Certainly Ruskin was a passionate man - no one who reads a letter of his could think otherwise - but the passion, as Batchelor notes, was largely reserved for Venetian architecture. </p> <p>It would be odd if some of the evasions and concealments of the life didn't cross over into the work. Technically he was a mid-period Romantic (\"Derwent Water\", the poem penned at a precocious 11, is a creditable piece of pastiche Wordsworth) keen on Carlyle, but capable of giving his absorption in art an intensely practical focus.</p> <p>Naturally enough, this being the 1840s, this process began with a defence of Turner - Ruskin's failure to write Turner's biography must rank as one of his great omissions - but as early as half way through his 17-year stint on Modern Painters he was stressing art's social basis and its function in conveying social truths. As Batchelor points out, this kind of thing had serious implications for the view he took of Victorian culture as a whole. If art had any merit it had to be the product of a \"moral\" society; at the same it had to reflect a complete world, something that even George Eliot and Balzac - whose narrow realism he deplored - were incapable of achieving. </p> <p>If all this sometimes makes critic Ruskin sound like the last of the premodernists, vainly holding on to a centre that was fraying at the edges, then it gives social reformer Ruskin a lasting resonance. At the heart of a work like The Political Economy of Art is a simply held belief that art is the expression of human delight in labour. Again this had far-reaching implications for the whole Victorian concept of \"betterment\". It implied a society that was static, or perhaps organic, rather than linear.</p> <p>Amid the anthills of Victorian social advancement, \"not only is the natural discontentedness of humanity developed to an unheard-of extent, whatever a man's position, but it becomes a veritable shame to him to remain in the state he was born, and everybody thinks it is his duty to be 'a gentleman'\". This is a romantic view of work in excelsis. Plenty of writers have laboured the connection between wealth and power: few have done quite so much to set down its effect on the average human spirit. </p> <p>Thereafter the path led to F D Maurice and his working men's colleges, William Morris, social experiments and even an end-of-century mock-medievalism, steamrollered by the late Victorian machine age - as, of course, it was always bound to be.</p> <p>Though the extraordinary feats of production were kept up nearly to the end - the autobiographical Praeterita was unfinished at his death - Ruskin's last years were a decline. Hilton offers an awesome recreation of the pressures to which the 60-year-old savant was subject: the relationship with Rose la Touche ending in tragedy (\"the woman I hoped would have been my wife is dying\"), a defence of the freethinking Bishop Colenso turning into an assault on the whole episcopal hierarchy.</p> <p>Again, one has the feeling - which is Hilton's point - that Ruskin's real targets go beyond the bench of bishops, and the person being defended is himself. By the final quarter of his life he was becoming out of date, and he knew it. Late-Victorian aesthetics, which in a sense he had helped to create (art for art's sake and the rest of it) were anathema to him.</p> <p>Whistler's libel suit of 1877 - Ruskin had remarked of \"Nocturnes\" that he \"never expected to hear a coxcomb ask 200 guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face\" - was an unhappy symbol of the new aesthetic divides. In the end Whistler was awarded a derisory farthing's damages, but the real loser was Ruskin. Meeting him in 1880, the 18-year-old A C Benson noted that he \"seemed to have come from a different century\". Worn out and mentally unstable, he still managed to survive a further 20 years. </p> <p>John Batchelor's book is an excellent short study, keenly alert to the social and political environments in which Ruskin found himself, if sometimes a bit confusing chronologically; Tim Hilton's the second part of a prodigious month-by-month pursuit. Allowing for the differences in scale and treatment, their message is broadly the same.</p> <p>Critic Ruskin may have been the last premodernist, social-theorist Ruskin the last amateur in an age of specialists, and yet, compared to the social and aesthetic counter-terrorists of the 1880s who supplanted him, he looks bang up-to-date. What, for example, would Ruskin have had to say about the Millennium Dome or the stakeholder economy? Retreating to the narrower world of books, I remember the late Sir Kingsley Amis once claiming that the writer's only duty was to literature. Ruskin, you suspect, would have corrected this to \"the rest of humanity\". And Ruskin would have been right.</p>",

Technically he was a mid-period Romantic (\"Derwent Water\", the poem penned at a precocious 11, is a creditable piece of pastiche Wordsworth) keen on Carlyle, but capable of giving his absorption in art an intensely practical focus. Naturally enough, this being the 1840s, this process began with a defence of Turner - Ruskin's failure to write Turner's biography must rank as one of his great omissions - but as early as half way through his 17-year stint on Modern Painters he was stressing art's social basis and its function in conveying social truths. As Batchelor points out, this kind of thing had serious implications for the view he took of Victorian culture as a whole. If art had any merit it had to be the product of a \"moral\" society; at the same it had to reflect a complete world, something that even George Eliot and Balzac - whose narrow realism he deplored - were incapable of achieving. If all this sometimes makes critic Ruskin sound like the last of the premodernists, vainly holding on to a centre that was fraying at the edges, then it gives social reformer Ruskin a lasting resonance. At the heart of a work like The Political Economy of Art is a simply held belief that art is the expression of human delight in labour. Again this had far-reaching implications for the whole Victorian concept of \"betterment\". It implied a society that was static, or perhaps organic, rather than linear. Amid the anthills of Victorian social advancement, \"not only is the natural discontentedness of humanity developed to an unheard-of extent, whatever a man's position, but it becomes a veritable shame to him to remain in the state he was born, and everybody thinks it is his duty to be 'a gentleman'\". This is a romantic view of work in excelsis. Plenty of writers have laboured the connection between wealth and power: few have done quite so much to set down its effect on the average human spirit. Thereafter the path led to F D Maurice and his working men's colleges, William Morris, social experiments and even an end-of-century mock-medievalism, steamrollered by the late Victorian machine age - as, of course, it was always bound to be. Though the extraordinary feats of production were kept up nearly to the end - the autobiographical Praeterita was unfinished at his death - Ruskin's last years were a decline. Hilton offers an awesome recreation of the pressures to which the 60-year-old savant was subject: the relationship with Rose la Touche ending in tragedy (\"the woman I hoped would have been my wife is dying\"), a defence of the freethinking Bishop Colenso turning into an assault on the whole episcopal hierarchy. Again, one has the feeling - which is Hilton's point - that Ruskin's real targets go beyond the bench of bishops, and the person being defended is himself. By the final quarter of his life he was becoming out of date, and he knew it. Late-Victorian aesthetics, which in a sense he had helped to create (art for art's sake and the rest of it) were anathema to him. Whistler's libel suit of 1877 - Ruskin had remarked of \"Nocturnes\" that he \"never expected to hear a coxcomb ask 200 guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face\" - was an unhappy symbol of the new aesthetic divides. In the end Whistler was awarded a derisory farthing's damages, but the real loser was Ruskin. Meeting him in 1880, the 18-year-old A C Benson noted that he \"seemed to have come from a different century\". Worn out and mentally unstable, he still managed to survive a further 20 years. John Batchelor's book is an excellent short study, keenly alert to the social and political environments in which Ruskin found himself, if sometimes a bit confusing chronologically; Tim Hilton's the second part of a prodigious month-by-month pursuit. Allowing for the differences in scale and treatment, their message is broadly the same. Critic Ruskin may have been the last premodernist, social-theorist Ruskin the last amateur in an age of specialists, and yet, compared to the social and aesthetic counter-terrorists of the 1880s who supplanted him, he looks bang up-to-date. What, for example, would Ruskin have had to say about the Millennium Dome or the stakeholder economy? Retreating to the narrower world of books, I remember the late Sir Kingsley Amis once claiming that the writer's only duty was to literature. Ruskin, you suspect, would have corrected this to \"the rest of humanity\". And Ruskin would have been right.",

The latest Granta begins with a tale by Raymond Carver, recently discovered among his papers, which masterfully uses the stopping short of narration to enact the ending of love. A husband tells of an optimistic yet sad holiday with his wife, a last attempt to repair a finished marriage. Love flickers at the edges of the narrator's clipped sentences, then goes out. </p> <p>The other love stories in this collection are also about love's failures. Ruth Gershon tells of an affair between a Jewish woman from London visiting Israel and her Arab landlord. Orhan Pamuk, in a narrative translated from the original Turkish, offers us a child's view of his parents' break-up. Both write well of the queer poignancy of memory, the way it catches at irrelevant detail in order to dodge painful feelings. Both pieces feel like fragments of memoir rather than short stories. Giving us everything that can be remembered, they allow themselves to ramble as if recollection were its own justification. Carver's story, in contrast, is a spare, completed fiction, engrossing and satisfying because of all it must leave out. </p> <p>Other stories also contain elements of autobiography.

      "bodyText": "Granta 68: Love Stories Granta, \u00a38.99, 256pp A novel about love might end in a wedding, but a short story about love seems destined to leave us with separation. The latest Granta begins with a tale by Raymond Carver, recently discovered among his papers, which masterfully uses the stopping short of narration to enact the ending of love. A husband tells of an optimistic yet sad holiday with his wife, a last attempt to repair a finished marriage. Love flickers at the edges of the narrator's clipped sentences, then goes out. The other love stories in this collection are also about love's failures. Ruth Gershon tells of an affair between a Jewish woman from London visiting Israel and her Arab landlord. Orhan Pamuk, in a narrative translated from the original Turkish, offers us a child's view of his parents' break-up. Both write well of the queer poignancy of memory, the way it catches at irrelevant detail in order to dodge painful feelings. Both pieces feel like fragments of memoir rather than short stories. Giving us everything that can be remembered, they allow themselves to ramble as if recollection were its own justification. Carver's story, in contrast, is a spare, completed fiction, engrossing and satisfying because of all it must leave out. Other stories also contain elements of autobiography. Aleksander Hemon gives an account of a huge family get-together, the ethnic self-importance of his American-Serbian-Ukranian relations never becoming quite comic enough to justify all the genealogy. Keith Fleming contributes a droll piece on the surrogate parenting skills of his uncle, the writer Edmund White, with whom he lived as a teenager after his parents' terrible divorce (and whom he rather easily forgives for an admittedly polite seduction attempt). James Hamilton-Paterson recalls, in a voice unnerving for its absence of self-pity, the experience of being gang-raped by five Bedouins while living in Libya in the 60s. \"Asking For It\" is the opposite of fiction: a real secret shared with only one friend until now.

So far 74 of those on the plane have formally applied for asylum to remain in Britain. A further 30 are expected to join them.</p> <p>Last night, as Essex police continued to question the 22 people arrested for being directly involved in the hijack, a Kampuchea airlines Trident jet, chartered by the International Organisation for Migration on behalf of the foreign office, was on standby at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, ready to fly to Kandahar those who wish to return home.</p> <p>The preparations were being made yesterday against a background of Tory and tabloid newspaper hostility towards granting any asylum concession to the remaining hostages. Amnesty International last night wrote to Jack Straw urging him to give proper consideration to the claims for asylum and telling him that Afghanistan's appalling human rights record was a chilling reminder of why Britain's asylum laws existed in the first place. The home secretary is likely to come under more pressure this weekend.</p> <p>The 142 hostages are to be bussed from the Hilton hotel at Stansted airport to the fire service college at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, at today.

Some of the 14 crew members are believed to be among those seeking asylum, although one flight engineer has said he wants to join the flight back to Afghanistan. So far 74 of those on the plane have formally applied for asylum to remain in Britain. A further 30 are expected to join them. Last night, as Essex police continued to question the 22 people arrested for being directly involved in the hijack, a Kampuchea airlines Trident jet, chartered by the International Organisation for Migration on behalf of the foreign office, was on standby at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, ready to fly to Kandahar those who wish to return home. The preparations were being made yesterday against a background of Tory and tabloid newspaper hostility towards granting any asylum concession to the remaining hostages. Amnesty International last night wrote to Jack Straw urging him to give proper consideration to the claims for asylum and telling him that Afghanistan's appalling human rights record was a chilling reminder of why Britain's asylum laws existed in the first place. The home secretary is likely to come under more pressure this weekend. The 142 hostages are to be bussed from the Hilton hotel at Stansted airport to the fire service college at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, at today. A home office fast-track asylum unit has been set up there to process their claims for refugee status. A translator helping police with the interviewing process at Harlow police station said the majority of the hostages he had spoken to had indicated they wanted to stay in Britain: \"Of the 11 people I spoke to only one, and he was a flight engineer anyway, did not say he wanted to stay.\" The details emerged during a second day of questioning by police and immigration officials at the Hilton.

Ryutaro Hashimoto in Japan didn't get it and now he's the former prime minister. Get what? The internet economy, of course. What Hashimoto did not get specifically was one of Chambers' many presentational charts. This showed US and Japanese economic growth rates more or less tracking each other before the mid-1990s, when America's rate suddenly took off. \"Through the 1980s we all thought Japanese industry had all the answers. But while they were still building out for the [first] industrial revolution the US was starting to build out for the internet revolution. I told him to stop investing in building bridges and battery plants.\" He didn't listen. </p> <p>The reason Chambers expects to be listened to is that he is chief executive of the second-biggest company on the planet - by stock market value. This week, as <a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/\" target=\"_new\">Cisco</a> issued another set of quarterly figures showing dramatic revenue growth, this \"tech titan\" overtook Jack Welch's <a href=\"http://www.ge.com\" target=\"_new\">General Electric</a>. Cisco is 14 years old and capitalised at $430bn (\u00a3270bn). </p> <p><strong> Shovels for miners</strong><br> </p> <p> Wall Street suggests Cisco will overtake <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com\" target=\"_new\">Microsoft</a> around about May and by the end of the year Chambers could be heading the world's first trillion-dollar corporation. </p> <p>\"It's just a tremendous honour,\" he says, standing in Building Nine, East Tasman, San Jose, clearly enjoying every moment of his new status. You can see it on the fresh face of this 50 year old who, having served his time as a computer industry executive in the fun-free years of the 70s and 80s at Wang Laboratories and IBM, was parachuted in to Cisco by the venture capital industry in 1993. Within two years he was at the helm of a business producing today's equivalent of shovels for the miners during the 19th century gold rush. </p> <p>Cisco makes the hardware and software that is the internet's backbone: the routers, switches and other gizmos with indigestible acronyms that allow data to move around our networked world. It shipped its first email router in 1986 and went public in 1990 with revenue at $69m. Ten years on, Cisco is set for a $20bn turnover. </p> <p>Statistics are the punctuation of Cham ber's high-adrenaline presentations. He uses them to puncture each and every traditional notion of adequate business practice. His company has ballooned from 1,000 employees to about 26,000 in less than 10 years, thanks to the internet. Cisco has transformed the very landscape of northern California. A good portion of San Jose is given over to a company with 35 buildings in the city, spread over 5m square feet - excluding car parking. </p> <p>\"Every company, every country is in transition whether it realises it or not,\" Chambers says. \"I'd like to tell you the reason that this is occurring is because of enlightened leadership, because of global competition, because of organisational changes. But the real reason for this change is survival.\" </p> <p>The word \"survival\" gets the full Chambers treatment - the syllables are dragged out by his soft southern drawl, there's plenty of theatre with his hands and then a twist of the head, to make sure his audience has no excuse for not getting it. </p> <p>\"The second industrial revolution. We started saying that five years ago. People said 'nice marketing, never going to happen'.\" Nowadays, pilgrims to San Jose don't question things when they are told that the first industrial revolution took 200 years but when historians come to write about the \"internet economy\" it will have happened in the space of three decades. </p> <p>This vision thing is not just about business and profits and corporate development. This man wants to change everything. Scrub Mr Internet, this man considers himself Mr Globalisation. </p> <p>\"The point I'm making is that this technology levels the playing field between companies and between countries. We have a chance to change the world here. The majority of countries did not participate in the industrial revolution,\" Chambers notes, going on to explain that second and third division nations have the chance to leapfrog into the internet age. </p> <p>By way of illustration, Chambers turns to Cisco's short but eventful corporate experience. \"We are the most advanced users of the internet anywhere in the world.\" He details how the use of networked technology in every aspect of Cisco's business has given the company an edge over its competitors. </p> <p>\"With 26,000 employees we have just two people doing travel expenses. Of 32 [manufacturing] plants worldwide, only two are our own. We have a virtual global plant. The majority of our products are built and shipped to customers without a single Cisco person touching them.\" </p> <p>In short, this gives Cisco fatter margins, with annual \"savings\" put at around $500m. Having posted results this week for the three months to end-January, the company's revenues are rolling higher at an annual rate of 50% and Chambers points out that Cisco's technological development enables it to publish figures just days after the quarter-end. Top managers are able to monitor every inch of the business in detail, more or less in real time. </p> <p>\"Competitors who don't do this will not be competitors in the future.\" </p> <p>For Chambers there are three \"waves\" in the internet revolution. The first is investment in technology and \"if you're not already into that you're behind\". The second is new applications: the new business models, products and procedures that stem from development of the internet. As for the third wave, it is still \"out there on the ocean.\" He calls it \"e-learning\". </p> <p>\"It's not quite there yet, just like e-commerce, which wasn't there two years ago. E-learning will be the third way. In this new world there will be empowerment. You will see what you want to learn. You will select what elements you want to have. </p> <p>\"People should be paid on skill sets, rather than on a degree mentality. At Cisco we give stock options and raises for productivity and effort, not for degrees. I have a guy in my office who joined at 17. He's now 19, earning $77,000 a year.\" </p> <p>\"My message as I travel the world is very simple: are you educating your students for where the jobs were or where the jobs are going to be in the future?\" Cisco has set up about 300 \"network academies\" in Europe, half of them in Britain, and that figure should double over the coming year. </p> <p><strong> The right time</strong><br> </p> <p> For the moment, however, the old world of business rather than education is feeling the full force of the internet storm.

Jennie Page, the chief executive, has been sacked, the scapegoat for the mistakes of two ministers, Peter Mandelson and Charles Falconer.</p> <p>The business world has been stunned. Many chief executives are holding their breath, hoping that the idea of firing someone for just one month's bad figures does not catch on.</p> <p>Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, the Guardian produces a far from flattering story about the qualifications of the new chief executive, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau.</p> <p>He's jetted in from Disneyland Paris in a desperate ministerial bid to save some bacon from this pig of a project. He has no wish to change any of the zones, but is considering cutting the entrance prices.</p> <p>That gives everyone who was thinking of going to the dome an excellent reason to put it off.</p> <p>Regenerating brownfields in a bend of the river near some of the world's most beautiful buildings at Greenwich was a good idea. The dome itself is an exciting space, full of potential.</p> <p>But you are not allowed to go by car. At \u00a320 for each adult on top of the train and tube fares, it is a big outlay if you are coming from far away, and difficult to get to even if you are closer. If it is going to cost you more than \u00a3200 for a family of four and involve several hours travelling each way, it's got to be worth it.</p> <p>The dome was over-hyped. A government which has lived on burnished reflections of itself in polished, friendly newspaper stories was suddenly made to look unpopular and foolish.</p> <p>Some came to see the whole dome story as a political allegory. In advance of the opening there was a bravura performance of presentation and hype. The spirit zone was something of an afterthought and had to be filled up at the last minute. It seemed as if the organisers had to be reminded that the calendar we were celebrating was a Christian one.</p> <p>At the opening a whole series of politically correct messages were sent of New Britain. Christianity took second place to 60s pop and a new kind of monarchy held hands with the prime minister.

      "bodyText": "Six weeks into the new millennium, and the dome experience has been bleak for New Labour. Jennie Page, the chief executive, has been sacked, the scapegoat for the mistakes of two ministers, Peter Mandelson and Charles Falconer. The business world has been stunned. Many chief executives are holding their breath, hoping that the idea of firing someone for just one month's bad figures does not catch on. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, the Guardian produces a far from flattering story about the qualifications of the new chief executive, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau. He's jetted in from Disneyland Paris in a desperate ministerial bid to save some bacon from this pig of a project. He has no wish to change any of the zones, but is considering cutting the entrance prices. That gives everyone who was thinking of going to the dome an excellent reason to put it off. Regenerating brownfields in a bend of the river near some of the world's most beautiful buildings at Greenwich was a good idea. The dome itself is an exciting space, full of potential. But you are not allowed to go by car. At \u00a320 for each adult on top of the train and tube fares, it is a big outlay if you are coming from far away, and difficult to get to even if you are closer. If it is going to cost you more than \u00a3200 for a family of four and involve several hours travelling each way, it's got to be worth it. The dome was over-hyped. A government which has lived on burnished reflections of itself in polished, friendly newspaper stories was suddenly made to look unpopular and foolish. Some came to see the whole dome story as a political allegory. In advance of the opening there was a bravura performance of presentation and hype. The spirit zone was something of an afterthought and had to be filled up at the last minute. It seemed as if the organisers had to be reminded that the calendar we were celebrating was a Christian one. At the opening a whole series of politically correct messages were sent of New Britain. Christianity took second place to 60s pop and a new kind of monarchy held hands with the prime minister. It was neither socialist nor traditional. After the opening people felt let down, disappointed, not sure promises had been delivered, not sure they had enjoyed it all as much as they were told they had. The river of fire, one of the big events, was apparently invisible to those who turned out to watch it. Fortunately it had been captured by a lonely cameraman far away on the Post Office tower, so the fees could be paid. There were poignant contrasts between the way the cabinet had travelled to and from their party, and the way the rest of us were treated. Someone of ministerial rank now needs to get a grip and issue new instructions to M. Gerbeau, the Disney arrival, on what they want. If they want the dome to rival the strap-hanging, stomach-churning excitement of Alton Towers, Blackpool Leisure Beach or Thorpe Park, they need to put in an exciting ride or two. If they want it to rival the information and interest of the Science or Natural History museums, they need to rewrite the scripts and beef up the zones. If they want to use their man from the magic kingdom to good effect they should tell him to lift the standards of housekeeping and service to those of American Disney. At the moment the dome is not part of the have-a-nice-day culture: it's mired in we've-had-our-day attitudes. It needs to be cleaner, sharper, more fun. After a few minutes in Disney California or Florida even the most hard-bitten cynics can suspend their disbelief. You just want a bigger ice-cream from the Main Street store. You believe in Peter Pan as you go flying over London. The adrenaline flows as you hurtle in the runaway train.

      "body": "<p>Manchester United and Vodafone yesterday gave the clearest indication yet of how technological changes are revolutionising the way the public consumes information and spend its money by announcing a pioneering sponsorship deal that will allow fans to watch live football matches and buy replica kits through their mobile phones. The world's largest mobile phone service provider has agreed a \u00a330m four-year alliance that will see it become United's official shirt sponsor and provide wireless internet services to the club's 12m supporters worldwide. </p> <p>Although Vodafone believes it will be four years before fans can watch a game live on their mobile, from August fans with Wap (wireless application protocol) phones will be able to receive news and latest scores direct from their handsets. </p> <p>Analysts say the move is tangible evidence of how mobile internet devices are set to overtake PCs and televisions as the most popular way of accessing information and entertainment. </p> <p>The first replica kits to bear the Vodafone motif will also be available to buy over the phone. </p> <p>By the start of the 2002-03 season, when the next generation of mobile phones will be widely available, supporters will be able to watch live footage of the latest Ryan Giggs goals and David Beckham sending-offs. The service will be available worldwide and in dozens of different languages, United's deputy chief executive, Peter Kenyon, said. </p> <p>\"Fans from Stretford to Shanghai will be able to keep up with all the action from Old Trafford 24 hours a day, no matter what language they speak,\" he said. \"All they will have to do is push a button on their phone.\" </p> <p>Peter Bamford, chief executive of Vodafone UK, said: \"This ground-breaking agreement goes beyond a pure shirt sponsorship and will bring a new range of mobile information services to a loyal massive supporter base.\" </p> <p><strong> Shares up</strong><br> </p> <p> The sponsorship deal is the richest in football history and ends United's 18-year alliance with the Japanese electronics company Sharp. The stock market has long awaited the move - the club's shares have risen by 50% since the start of the year, valuing it at almost \u00a3800m. </p> <p>Analysts predict that it will widen the financial gap between the world's richest football club and its rivals in the UK and overseas. \"No other club could have pulled this off,\" said one analyst. \"Only now are we beginning to see the value of the Manchester United brand and its importance as a multi-media asset.\" </p> <p>The agreement ends United's 12 month search for a new sponsor. Vodafone beat off competition from Microsoft, Yahoo!, Emirates and British Airways. </p> <p>The deal is just the latest of a number of new services consumers will have to get used to as mobile phones connect them to the internet. Almost anything that can be digitised into the 1s and 0s of computer code - words, sounds, voices, images and video - can be put on to the internet and downloaded to mobiles in suitably abbreviated form. </p> <p>The first Wap phones are already on the streets. Swedish giant Ericsson said yesterday there could be 600m mobile phones in use worldwide by 2002, and that may prove to be an underestimate. </p> <p>Already the new WAP phones can be used to send email, receive news clips, stock market prices or football results, book theatres or restaurants, place bets, check your bank account or to create a direct link to parts of your own website. You can even watch a live mini-map showing traffic jams on the ring road around Paris. </p> <p>But we have hardly seen anything yet. The technology is about to explode, bringing phones with such huge bandwidth - the amount of data they can receive in a second - that they will be able to send and receive high quality moving pictures and CD-quality sound. </p> <p>Apart from watching a football match remotely, you could participate in lectures at Harvard from a beach in the south of France, or consult your doctor in his surgery while on holiday. By pointing the miniaturised camera to your open mouth you may be able to give enough data for the doctor to qualm your fears about that mouth ulcer. Or you could check on the babysitter, or an aged relative at home, from a cinema foyer by dialling into the web-camera in your living room. Wap phones will almost certainly make other products redundant, such as the Walkman and the current fad, the MP3 players that download music from the internet. The new mobiles will be able to do more. </p> <p>The new phones, equipped with tiny global positioning systems, will also know exactly where you are to within a few metres. This will enable restaurants or theatres in the area to win your custom by emailing you special deals (the internet start-up company Lastminute.com is already on some of the new Wap phones). Helsinki is building a virtual model of the city, complete with roads and buildings, one feature of which is that parents will be able to tell exactly where in the city their phone-carrying children are. </p> <p>For once the digital action is not in the United States but Europe. Finland's Nokia, with 29% of the world mobile phone market, has just rolled out its 7110, to be closely followed by Ericsson, the world's second largest mobile manufacturer, Motorola of the US, and Siemens. Vodafone is British, as is Psion, which is challenging Microsoft to provide the standard operating system for internet phones. </p> <p>In the end the market will decide which of a bewildering variety of models will win. Some will be light with small screens, able to fit in the pocket, others will have bigger screens and look more like palmtop computers than phones. Others will be worn as part of our clothing. It will be a trade-off between size and convenience. </p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,135982,00.html \">The Wap phone</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,135981,00.html\">Why the profitable future of football viewing could be in the hands of fans</a></p>",

Although Vodafone believes it will be four years before fans can watch a game live on their mobile, from August fans with Wap (wireless application protocol) phones will be able to receive news and latest scores direct from their handsets. Analysts say the move is tangible evidence of how mobile internet devices are set to overtake PCs and televisions as the most popular way of accessing information and entertainment. The first replica kits to bear the Vodafone motif will also be available to buy over the phone. By the start of the 2002-03 season, when the next generation of mobile phones will be widely available, supporters will be able to watch live footage of the latest Ryan Giggs goals and David Beckham sending-offs. The service will be available worldwide and in dozens of different languages, United's deputy chief executive, Peter Kenyon, said. \"Fans from Stretford to Shanghai will be able to keep up with all the action from Old Trafford 24 hours a day, no matter what language they speak,\" he said. \"All they will have to do is push a button on their phone.\" Peter Bamford, chief executive of Vodafone UK, said: \"This ground-breaking agreement goes beyond a pure shirt sponsorship and will bring a new range of mobile information services to a loyal massive supporter base.\" Shares up The sponsorship deal is the richest in football history and ends United's 18-year alliance with the Japanese electronics company Sharp. The stock market has long awaited the move - the club's shares have risen by 50% since the start of the year, valuing it at almost \u00a3800m. Analysts predict that it will widen the financial gap between the world's richest football club and its rivals in the UK and overseas. \"No other club could have pulled this off,\" said one analyst. \"Only now are we beginning to see the value of the Manchester United brand and its importance as a multi-media asset.\" The agreement ends United's 12 month search for a new sponsor. Vodafone beat off competition from Microsoft, Yahoo!, Emirates and British Airways. The deal is just the latest of a number of new services consumers will have to get used to as mobile phones connect them to the internet. Almost anything that can be digitised into the 1s and 0s of computer code - words, sounds, voices, images and video - can be put on to the internet and downloaded to mobiles in suitably abbreviated form. The first Wap phones are already on the streets. Swedish giant Ericsson said yesterday there could be 600m mobile phones in use worldwide by 2002, and that may prove to be an underestimate. Already the new WAP phones can be used to send email, receive news clips, stock market prices or football results, book theatres or restaurants, place bets, check your bank account or to create a direct link to parts of your own website. You can even watch a live mini-map showing traffic jams on the ring road around Paris. But we have hardly seen anything yet. The technology is about to explode, bringing phones with such huge bandwidth - the amount of data they can receive in a second - that they will be able to send and receive high quality moving pictures and CD-quality sound. Apart from watching a football match remotely, you could participate in lectures at Harvard from a beach in the south of France, or consult your doctor in his surgery while on holiday. By pointing the miniaturised camera to your open mouth you may be able to give enough data for the doctor to qualm your fears about that mouth ulcer. Or you could check on the babysitter, or an aged relative at home, from a cinema foyer by dialling into the web-camera in your living room. Wap phones will almost certainly make other products redundant, such as the Walkman and the current fad, the MP3 players that download music from the internet. The new mobiles will be able to do more. The new phones, equipped with tiny global positioning systems, will also know exactly where you are to within a few metres. This will enable restaurants or theatres in the area to win your custom by emailing you special deals (the internet start-up company Lastminute.com is already on some of the new Wap phones). Helsinki is building a virtual model of the city, complete with roads and buildings, one feature of which is that parents will be able to tell exactly where in the city their phone-carrying children are. For once the digital action is not in the United States but Europe. Finland's Nokia, with 29% of the world mobile phone market, has just rolled out its 7110, to be closely followed by Ericsson, the world's second largest mobile manufacturer, Motorola of the US, and Siemens. Vodafone is British, as is Psion, which is challenging Microsoft to provide the standard operating system for internet phones. In the end the market will decide which of a bewildering variety of models will win. Some will be light with small screens, able to fit in the pocket, others will have bigger screens and look more like palmtop computers than phones. Others will be worn as part of our clothing. It will be a trade-off between size and convenience. Related stories The Wap phone Why the profitable future of football viewing could be in the hands of fans",

      "body": "<p>Poor Reginald Perrin. He cut a sad pin-striped figure as he walked home. Wordsworth Avenue was followed by Tennyson Avenue which was followed by Coleridge Close. A little death at each corner. In The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin (BBC2) there was nothing to look forward to, certainly not on television. \"In tonight's programme: the reorganisation of British water boards - what does it mean for you? The oil sheikh who's bought Lincolnshire. And polystyrene wine racks - do they cause warts? Next, an award-winning Norwegian comedy about social problems in the tundra.\" </p> <p>Reggie turned the off switch. This was before remote controls, and, clearly, at a time when oil sheikh references were topical. It had been a hard day at the office with a crazy boss.\"I didn't get where I am today,\" CJ had said earlier, \"by wearing underpants decorated with Beethoven.\" CJ had been conducting an inquest in the office about the underwear of his underlings. The one who comments \"Great\" in response to everything that CJ says had a big picture of Beethoven on his pants. The one who says \"Super\" had blue Y-fronts that met with CJ's approval: \"Very sensible. A splash of colour but not inconsistent with executive dignity.\" </p> <p>Reggie looked benign, trying not to betray his contempt, but with just enough of it peeping through that we could share his real feelings. God, the late Leonard Rossiter was one of the greatest comic actors in British sitcom history. And yet Michael Winner still lives. But enough of such comparisons. What is the point of living when you're a man responsible for an instant puddings sales drive in Schleswig-Holstein? </p> <p>\"I've come about Mr Perrin, doctor,\" said Reggie's secretary, ogled into a chair by the slimeball behind the desk. \"Do you know what's wrong with him?\" \"Yes I do. Middle-aged exhaustion, boredom, anxiety, self-disgust, misery, insecurity, dislike of industry, dislike of instant pudding, 25-year itch, fear, insecurity, frustration.\" \"What can be done about it?\" \"I have no idea.\" Typical: the doctor didn't care about this middle-aged man. Instead he wanted to know if he could examine the secretary to determine if she was \"chesty\" and asked her to perform some cartwheels for him. But that was the 70s, when sitcom gags that sound like sexual harassment cases waiting to happen were not just tolerable but obligatory. </p> <p>It's not a surprise, is it, that middle-aged men are so troubled? When they have to stand in the boss's office with their trousers around their ankles. When they have to sell instant puddings for a living. When they have to perform rectal investigations on lower life forms when, frankly, they'd rather not. When they can't sustain meaningful relationships with women for more than a few minutes. </p> <p>That's right. Rectal investigations. In Beast (BBC1), Simon Nye's unexpectedly delightful sitcom about a veterinary practice, one of the vets had circumscribed the number of species with which he was prepared to work. No more would he deal with ferrets, pythons, yappy or indeed non-yappy dogs. No animals with big stary eyes. </p> <p>Instead the middle-aged vet decided he would become a pet therapist.

      "bodyText": "Poor Reginald Perrin. He cut a sad pin-striped figure as he walked home. Wordsworth Avenue was followed by Tennyson Avenue which was followed by Coleridge Close. A little death at each corner. In The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin (BBC2) there was nothing to look forward to, certainly not on television. \"In tonight's programme: the reorganisation of British water boards - what does it mean for you? The oil sheikh who's bought Lincolnshire. And polystyrene wine racks - do they cause warts? Next, an award-winning Norwegian comedy about social problems in the tundra.\" Reggie turned the off switch. This was before remote controls, and, clearly, at a time when oil sheikh references were topical. It had been a hard day at the office with a crazy boss.\"I didn't get where I am today,\" CJ had said earlier, \"by wearing underpants decorated with Beethoven.\" CJ had been conducting an inquest in the office about the underwear of his underlings. The one who comments \"Great\" in response to everything that CJ says had a big picture of Beethoven on his pants. The one who says \"Super\" had blue Y-fronts that met with CJ's approval: \"Very sensible. A splash of colour but not inconsistent with executive dignity.\" Reggie looked benign, trying not to betray his contempt, but with just enough of it peeping through that we could share his real feelings. God, the late Leonard Rossiter was one of the greatest comic actors in British sitcom history. And yet Michael Winner still lives. But enough of such comparisons. What is the point of living when you're a man responsible for an instant puddings sales drive in Schleswig-Holstein? \"I've come about Mr Perrin, doctor,\" said Reggie's secretary, ogled into a chair by the slimeball behind the desk. \"Do you know what's wrong with him?\" \"Yes I do. Middle-aged exhaustion, boredom, anxiety, self-disgust, misery, insecurity, dislike of industry, dislike of instant pudding, 25-year itch, fear, insecurity, frustration.\" \"What can be done about it?\" \"I have no idea.\" Typical: the doctor didn't care about this middle-aged man. Instead he wanted to know if he could examine the secretary to determine if she was \"chesty\" and asked her to perform some cartwheels for him. But that was the 70s, when sitcom gags that sound like sexual harassment cases waiting to happen were not just tolerable but obligatory. It's not a surprise, is it, that middle-aged men are so troubled? When they have to stand in the boss's office with their trousers around their ankles. When they have to sell instant puddings for a living. When they have to perform rectal investigations on lower life forms when, frankly, they'd rather not. When they can't sustain meaningful relationships with women for more than a few minutes. That's right. Rectal investigations. In Beast (BBC1), Simon Nye's unexpectedly delightful sitcom about a veterinary practice, one of the vets had circumscribed the number of species with which he was prepared to work. No more would he deal with ferrets, pythons, yappy or indeed non-yappy dogs. No animals with big stary eyes. Instead the middle-aged vet decided he would become a pet therapist. It was clean work, involving, so far as he could judge, little more than lying on a couch with a clipboard. \"Shouldn't the dog be sitting on the couch?\" asked a depressed dog's owner. \"I suppose so.\" They swapped places, but only for a while. What men want, you see, is a little bit of quiet time. Perhaps a doze. \"I came in when you were doing a session with the parrot,\" said the receptionist. \"You were asleep.\" \"No I wasn't.\" \"Yes you were.\" I wanted the sadly aborted pet therapist storyline to continue for several years.

I write a column for his online magazine, Slate, which I don't imagine is widely read in this country, even by enthusiasts for the internet, but which is nevertheless an admirable and entertaining publication. So I still look up to Bill Gates as one tends to look up to anybody who helps with the household bills. And, of course, I am obliged to look up to him as probably the richest person who has ever lived. But as a prophet, as a visionary, as the person who understands the future and will guide us there, Mr Gates suffered a huge blow to his credibility last weekend when he appeared on BBC1's Breakfast With Frost to announce that he was teaming up with Sir Richard Branson to take over the running of the British National Lottery. </p> <p>I have, by my bed, his book, The Road Ahead, which I haven't actually read but which I keep there, like a holy scripture, for easy reference in a spiritual crisis. But I don't think I will ever consult it now. The man of vision has feet of clay. He has chosen to become part of what the Independent, in a leading article this week, described as \"the culture of greed that is seeping through Britain\". The Independent rather understated the situation. The culture of greed is not \"seeping\" through Britain; it is swamping it. The urge to get rich quick without effort has become a national obsession, and its principal manifestation is the National Lottery. </p> <p>So why should Mr Gates want to be involved in such a sleazy enterprise? He certainly doesn't need the money he will earn if he and Sir Richard manage to wrest the franchise away from Camelot. There has to be some other reason. He told Sir David Frost that it is all part of the vision thing. He intends to improve the technology of the Lottery to make it \"a richer experience for the people who want to use it\". He explained: \"The Lottery terminals in the past have not used PC technology, and there hasn't been a way of leveraging all the things going on with the internet.\" I don't understand a word of that, but it doesn't sound very visionary to me. </p> <p>The \"richer experience\" he promises should probably be understood only in the sense that it will make people literally richer. Sir Richard pledged that a Lottery managed by him and Mr Gates would create a millionaire a day. It would also, he claimed, raise an extra \u00a32 billion for good causes. This, of course, is the entire justification for the Lottery's existence, that it produces money for good causes. Sir Richard says that 12 million people have stopped playing the Lottery under Camelot because they don't think it is sufficiently philanthropic. If people feel that all the profits are going into good causes, then around six million lost customers will return, Sir Richard says. </p> <p> I wish I could believe that, but I can't say I do. The reason why people have been abandoning the Lottery in their millions is that they see no prospect of making any money out of it. One cannot remain excited forever if one never wins. The advertising slogan \"It could be you\" was a seductive one to begin with, but most people now feel \"It is extremely unlikely to be me\". They feel they have a much better chance of getting rich quick by speculating in the shares of internet companies. Sir Richard's promise to create a new millionaire every day will be far more effective in attracting people back to the Lottery than his pledge that all its profits will go to good causes. Gambling is not an altruistic activity. It never has been and it isn't now. </p> <p> The irony is that Mr Gates did not set out to be fantastically rich. As he explained to Sir David, he had a vision of the future in computer software and singlemindedly pursued it. He didn't have \"some number in mind\" for the profits he could turn. \"I love doing software and, you know, I'm still stunned that it was such a good, good business to be in,\" he said. He gives away billions of dollars to good causes, such as the vaccination of children against disease. And he has stepped down as chief executive of Microsoft to indulge once again his creative side as the corporation's chief software architect. </p> <p>So what is he doing messing with the National Lottery? Sir Richard must have charmed him with his vision rhetoric, for Mr Gates is a sucker for visions. I have a vision for him. He should buy the Millennium Dome, which he can easily afford, and turn it into a giant exhibition of the future. He has promised developments in information technology that will \"blow people away\" in the next couple of years. Let us be blown away now. Let him give the Dome its missing \"wow\" factor. Then maybe I will believe in him as a prophet again.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u0095Something of a seismic shift (\u00a9 T Blair) has been spotted inside No 11, according to an agent lurking outside the chancellor's official residence a week or so back. Without a peep of publicity, Gordon Brown hosted a most agreeable symposium titled Keynes and Full Employment in the 21st Century, seemingly rehabilitating the K-word in polite Labour circles whence it has been banished since 1976. </p> <p>Rounding up the usual suspects from the Keynesian resistance - Steve Nickell and Richard Layard (LSE), plus Cantab's wholly unreconstructed Bob Rowthorn, Mr Brown then required the entire monetary policy committee to listen to them. This must have been something of an ordeal for most MPC types, given the committee's entire existence is predicated on the conviction that Keynes is a discredited old ninny whose silly ideas caused us no end of trouble. </p> <p>Charles Bean (also LSE) gave a paper on the difference between Keynesianisms old and new, while the Bank of England's Mervyn King spoke on the differences between the MPC and the US Federal Reserve Board; maybe fed-style semi-laxity is the MPC's fallback position. Anyway, this happy band (we won't describe it as \"Gordon Brown's personal think-tank\", but you feel free) has promised to meet again at No 11 after the budget. </p> <p>\u0095 Elsewhere in Whitehall, a final, fond farewell to the millennium bug, now destined for the great dustbin of super-scares of yesteryear, along with the \"new ice age\", the Bermuda triangle and the \"doomsday bomb\". The office for national statistics tells the world that \"because of the low number of companies being affected\" it is ending the collection of data on bug-related incidents. The penultimate collection - for the end of January - found 99% of firms suffering no ill-effects whatever. Of those that did, the largest single category was \"hotels and restaurants\". We thought aeroplanes were supposed to fall from the sky and nuclear plants melt down. Instead, it seems the occasional steak may have been a trifle underdone. </p> <p>\u0095 New technology forges ahead, however, east of Suez, where Hutchison, the mobile telephone company, is making great inroads into the Indian market. Whether it will continue to do so is more doubtful, given that Hutchison has decided to adopt over there the name under which it became famous over here: Orange. Harmless enough in Britain (give or take the occasional chap in a bowler hat) but a potential marketing disaster in the subcontinent, where saffron is the colour of the BJP, the Hindu nationalist party. The future's, er, bright? </p> <p>\u0095 Meanwhile, that bargain-basement Keynesian public works scheme known as the Dome is causing no end of trouble far and wide. Last weekend's resignation by supremo Jennie Page drove her partner in life, Jeremy Orme - ratcatcher-general for the financial services authority - from the house. As the press settled in for a long siege, Mr Orme, who had hoped to catch up on some FSA paperwork, was forced to drive his car way away into open country, where he set up a temporary office. </p> <p>\u0095 Elsewhere in the legal field, the Law Society is getting with the information age. A web page is under construction, but already looks very pretty, carrying the society's imposing crest and a little emblem showing a man at work.

      "bodyText": "\u0095Something of a seismic shift (\u00a9 T Blair) has been spotted inside No 11, according to an agent lurking outside the chancellor's official residence a week or so back. Without a peep of publicity, Gordon Brown hosted a most agreeable symposium titled Keynes and Full Employment in the 21st Century, seemingly rehabilitating the K-word in polite Labour circles whence it has been banished since 1976. Rounding up the usual suspects from the Keynesian resistance - Steve Nickell and Richard Layard (LSE), plus Cantab's wholly unreconstructed Bob Rowthorn, Mr Brown then required the entire monetary policy committee to listen to them. This must have been something of an ordeal for most MPC types, given the committee's entire existence is predicated on the conviction that Keynes is a discredited old ninny whose silly ideas caused us no end of trouble. Charles Bean (also LSE) gave a paper on the difference between Keynesianisms old and new, while the Bank of England's Mervyn King spoke on the differences between the MPC and the US Federal Reserve Board; maybe fed-style semi-laxity is the MPC's fallback position. Anyway, this happy band (we won't describe it as \"Gordon Brown's personal think-tank\", but you feel free) has promised to meet again at No 11 after the budget. \u0095 Elsewhere in Whitehall, a final, fond farewell to the millennium bug, now destined for the great dustbin of super-scares of yesteryear, along with the \"new ice age\", the Bermuda triangle and the \"doomsday bomb\". The office for national statistics tells the world that \"because of the low number of companies being affected\" it is ending the collection of data on bug-related incidents. The penultimate collection - for the end of January - found 99% of firms suffering no ill-effects whatever. Of those that did, the largest single category was \"hotels and restaurants\". We thought aeroplanes were supposed to fall from the sky and nuclear plants melt down. Instead, it seems the occasional steak may have been a trifle underdone. \u0095 New technology forges ahead, however, east of Suez, where Hutchison, the mobile telephone company, is making great inroads into the Indian market. Whether it will continue to do so is more doubtful, given that Hutchison has decided to adopt over there the name under which it became famous over here: Orange. Harmless enough in Britain (give or take the occasional chap in a bowler hat) but a potential marketing disaster in the subcontinent, where saffron is the colour of the BJP, the Hindu nationalist party. The future's, er, bright? \u0095 Meanwhile, that bargain-basement Keynesian public works scheme known as the Dome is causing no end of trouble far and wide. Last weekend's resignation by supremo Jennie Page drove her partner in life, Jeremy Orme - ratcatcher-general for the financial services authority - from the house. As the press settled in for a long siege, Mr Orme, who had hoped to catch up on some FSA paperwork, was forced to drive his car way away into open country, where he set up a temporary office. \u0095 Elsewhere in the legal field, the Law Society is getting with the information age. A web page is under construction, but already looks very pretty, carrying the society's imposing crest and a little emblem showing a man at work. Rather, it would look very pretty were it not that an individual who was clearly disgruntled with the society's discharge of its regulatory functions has posted an e-flyer on the page, warning that: \"The Law Society is the trade body which represents English solicitors ... You will get little help and a great deal of obfuscation.\" Surely not? \u0095 Finally, we recommend Ranald Michie's excellent book The London Stock Exchange (Oxford;1999) for the lurid light it throws on the practices of the pre-war City. For instance: \"An investigation by the stock exchange ... in 1930 uncovered the fact that a member, Cyril James, was involved in share-pushing, whereby investors were recommended to buy shares through false reports of a company's prospects in newspapers like British Industry and Finance.\" Furthermore, the Economist of November 10, 1928 warned against \"repeated oversubscription of speculative issues, the attraction of whose deferred shares as gambling counters were more regarded by the public than their merits as an investment.\" None of that sort of thing nowadays, thank heaven.",

The all-party standards and privileges committee is about to finalise a \"damning\" report on her, said one member. The outspoken Ms Gorman is accused of failing to register all her business interests, and of misleading Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary standards commissioner. She was forced to apologise to the Commons last May for failing to register her ownership of two bedsit houses in Streatham, south London. Ms Filkin had asked, \"for the sake of completeness\", whether Ms Gorman owned \"any land or property, other than any home used for [the Gorman's] personal residential purposes, which has a substantial value or from which substantial income is derived.\" Ms Gorman told Ms Filkin that she received no money, but former tenants of the two bed-sit houses have since alleged that they paid rent to the Billericay MP and her husband, Jim.

She said the process would remain unfair until recommendations by Lord Neill's committee on standards in public life, including a right of appeal and financial aid for defence, were implemented. Mrs Gorman is one of Westminster's most colourful characters but has been dogged by controversy. In 1994 it emerged that she had bought a house next door to her own, in Lord North Street, from Westminster council and sold it at a profit.

      "body": "<p>As time goes on, and as I see more of this country, I often get the feeling that it is less of a \"land\" than it used to be, and far more of a collection of small countries just waiting to break away. Perhaps the idea of devolution for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland has made each part of England think about its specialness, too; perhaps it is a fear of being blanded out into one, big, soulless Euro-portion by Brussels that makes us cleave to local custom. And perhaps this is why commentators are having trouble finding the \"real\" England; perhaps there isn't going to be one for much longer, but just the North, and the South, and the West, and the East. </p> <p>What exactly does a pig farmer in Cornwall have in common with an estate agent in Cheshire or a night-club dancer in Hammersmith, anyway? Vitally, and unlike almost every other nation, Britain does not have a collective chip on its shoulder holding it together; we had it all, and we let it go. Far from being a so-called \"young\" country, we are probably the most mature country there is, for good or ill; we don't go around panicking about being dissed like France or the US, and we look back in languor and amazement at our glorious past. It's not the worst way to be at all - but it does mean we lack a set of grievances to rally around. </p> <p>I'm not immune from this. As I get older, I find that, more and more, I yearn to hear the accent of my calf country, the South-west of England. More than any other, we are the people of England that have never spoken yet, and still do not, unless you count the \"Ooo- arr-Ambrosiar!\" advert. (Growing up, my only West Country role model was Cadbury's Caramel bunny.) </p> <p>For years as a London-dweller I kidded myself that The Archers was set in the South-west, but my Sunday-morning fix went the way of all flesh when I could block out no longer the fact that the Aldridges were always \"popping into Birmingham\" to see a ballet. I always forget how rarely the West Country accent is heard in the media until I go back and am surrounded by its lapping, quizzical sinuousness. I'm amazed when people find it odd or unattractive. </p> <p>When my Dartington-educated friend recently accompanied me home for my mother's funeral, I noticed she was talking far less than usual, and this is a girl who could talk for England. She admitted she couldn't understand the Bristol accent, and had been terrified of responding to a question the wrong way (\"Isn't it awful about Julie's mum?\" - \"Mmm, yes, super!\"). At first I thought this incredible; then I thought, well, where would she hear it? </p> <p>The broadcasting media is alive with the buzz of Scots and the burble of Irish, but where is the West, or Birmingham, or Newcastle? It's not just that the West Country voices lack the \"authority\" to read the news; anyone watching Casualty will be surprised to find that Nurse Lisa Duffin, played by Cathy Shipton, started life with a strong Bristol accent, which she was told to lose as viewers couldn't understand it. This would be insulting in any circumstances; considering Casualty is set and filmed in Bristol, it is downright surreal. Imagine the producers of EastEnders telling black or Asian characters to speak proper English because no one could understand them! </p> <p>It was I who first coined the word Capitalist (big C) to describe one who worships and fetishises London, and I was more than guilty of this myself during the 70s and 80s. But even then, when I went home to Bristol I was struck by the absolute lack of interest in London among even my liveliest and smartest Bristol friends. London was less than two hours on the train but might as well have been in Australia; they weren't frightened of it, but saw it as a place where people went who couldn't make it in Bristol! I got the impression that they considered London to be a city of whores - artistic, financial and sexual, more to be pitied than envied. I don't think they were far wrong. </p> <p>If anything, it's got worse; London can't even create the thing it was synonymous with - pop music - any more. In the 60s and 70s, London either produced its own great pop groups - the Who, the Kinks, the Small Faces - or drew the best work from those provincials who moved there - the Beatles. When was the last great London sound? And how easily the wild northern boys are ruined by its siren song. The last albums by the once great Pulp and Oasis might just as well both have been called \"London\", because that is surely what they're like: sound and fury, signifying nothing, all sucked dry. </p> <p> \"Perhaps you'll come home now?\" - the neighbours still say that to me, even after 23 years away. For the first time, their question makes more sense than my answer. More and more, I see my whole flight from my hometown to the capital as some sort of disorder, albeit one that plagues young people all over the world the moment hormones and ambition kick in. Politics and media in these islands are dominated by Scots who live in Islington and believe that every place in between doesn't matter a heap of beans; you're not telling me that's healthy. </p> <p>I don't think I could ever go home for good, but I can carry my home with my voice: better Minnie Mouse from Ooo-Arr country than the Talking Clock lady and gent any day of the week. To people of the regions, the banal pronunciation that passes as the English norm conjures up all the glamour and glory of the drab couple in the weather house. After 23 years in the media, and to some extent the public eye, I'm still amazed that people are so amazed at the way I talk. How is a journalist \"meant\" to talk - like a cosseted Oxbridge spawn whose Daddy was in the Cabinet and Mummy a minor aristo? Should I have realised while young that my accent was \"wrong\", as Sue Lawley and Joan Bakewell did, and changed it for something more Sanderson? </p> <p>Yes, I am from the western English working class. No, my name is not Lawson, Wyatt or Coren. Yes, I made it all by myself, with no old-school network and no trust-fund safety net. No, I have never had to wait for a parent to die or for a spouse to surrender worldly goods in a divorce court, because I made and spent my own first million by the endeavour of my own brain and hands (well, middle finger of right hand) before I was 35. Yes, I love my voice, because it speaks to me of all these things and of someone who is resourceful, unbowed, original and, above all, untamed. Would I swap it for a received pronunciation job, modulated and acceptable and like every other godawful boring journalist's voice? I'd rather have my tongue cut out.</p>",

Of course if the \"heroes\" are not western whites, but Afghans, they are afforded no such glamour and instead are heaped with vicious opprobrium by Widdecombe and Straw. Simon Gardner Leighton Buzzard, Beds \u0095 Is there any chance Mr Straw could accompany the hostages back to Afghanistan? I hear the rulers have some interesting ideas on law and order that he might learn about at first hand. On his way back he might try the treatment we mete out to asylum seekers. Dr Kimon Roussopoulos Cambridge kimon@kimon.demon.co.uk \u0095 Do the asylum seekers know that they would be required to share this small island with Ann Widdecombe? John Ratty Llangollen \u0095 I'm tired of hearing scapegoated Jenny Page referred to as \"bossy\" and schoolmarmish (Rollercoaster ride of Disney whizz kid, February 11). If she had been male, it would have been \"decisive and single-minded\". Mary Scott Aberdeen \u0095 Are the dome sponsors, disappointed they have acquired PY Gerbeau rather than Philippe Bourguignon, entitled to ask \"where's the beef?\" Peter Barnes Milton Keynes \u0095 Is there a person credited with turning the millennium wheel around?

Gerry Adams announced what could be a breakthrough: enough progress on decommissioning to enable General de Chastelain to furnish a fresh report offering substance where his first report offered mere aspirations. The decommissioning issue, Mr Adams maintained - and the Dublin government seemed to share his enthusiasm - had at last been surmounted. But too late. The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, had some 20 minutes earlier set in hand the process which, after little more than 70 days, would put the Northern Ireland assembly and its associated enterprises into cold storage. For him, the initiative was too little, too late. By the time these words are printed this morning, we may have learned what the general thinks of the terms which IRA has offered. The best hope may be that the formula now arrived at may perhaps form the basis for reviving the process later.</p> <p>This morning will see recriminations which will need to be controlled if they are not to inflame a delicate, perhaps dangerous, situation. The suspension of the institutions should ensure that David Trimble's threat to resign is not carried through, but moves were last night expected at the meeting of his Ulster Unionist Council which could make it near impossible to get negotiations going again: especially the demand that the price to be paid for any further Unionist participation must be the scrapping of Chris Patten's plans for reform of the RUC. The British government, as sensible unionists know, could not possibly meet a demand like that. For such a move to succeed would be a disaster.</p> <p>Though many of the participants were last night dismayed and depressed, as well as dog tired, this is not by any means the end of the story. Compared with what happened 25 years ago, when the last power-sharing venture collapsed, the portents are truly encouraging. The Sinn Fein leadership may not have swung the IRA round to even token decommissioning soon enough, but they have brought them a very long way. De Chastelain confirms it: he found them resolved not to return to violence and committed to the peace process. These may be dismissed as mere words, but they are words which not so long ago would have seemed quite extraordinary coming from such a source. There is no small irony, as Mr Adams recently observed, in an Irish Republican leader trying to persuade a Unionist leader and the British government not to collapse a partitionist administration at Stormont.</p> <p>Much of the new mood has to do with the fact that people in Northern Ireland, who dreamed vainly of peace for so many years, have now had a taste of it and do not want to let it go. The power-sharing phase, brief though it was, has been a success. It is in this context that any lingering recalcitrance has to be judged. If they refuse any move towards decommissioning, as the SDLP's wise Seamus Mallon was saying the other day, they are not simply trying their strength against political opponents: they are defying the settled will of the people of Ireland, north and south. That is why, possibly on the formula Mr Adams flourished last night, the process has a good chance of resuming and restoring in time the institutions frozen last night. It is a bleak moment; but there have been many such in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years and the potential for recovery this time looks better than most.</p>",

These may be dismissed as mere words, but they are words which not so long ago would have seemed quite extraordinary coming from such a source. There is no small irony, as Mr Adams recently observed, in an Irish Republican leader trying to persuade a Unionist leader and the British government not to collapse a partitionist administration at Stormont. Much of the new mood has to do with the fact that people in Northern Ireland, who dreamed vainly of peace for so many years, have now had a taste of it and do not want to let it go. The power-sharing phase, brief though it was, has been a success. It is in this context that any lingering recalcitrance has to be judged. If they refuse any move towards decommissioning, as the SDLP's wise Seamus Mallon was saying the other day, they are not simply trying their strength against political opponents: they are defying the settled will of the people of Ireland, north and south. That is why, possibly on the formula Mr Adams flourished last night, the process has a good chance of resuming and restoring in time the institutions frozen last night. It is a bleak moment; but there have been many such in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years and the potential for recovery this time looks better than most.",

      "body": "<p>Share tipping has become big business with scores of newsletters, magazines and newspaper columns aimed at experienced investors and first-time punters attracted by rocketing prices in dot.com and hi-tech companies.</p> <p>And that's not counting the financial chat rooms where stock aficionados swap market gossip with one another.</p> <p>But the battle between the Mirror and the Sun, and their mutual accusations of dirty dealing, have revealed the murky side of share tipping. Both sides in this redtop newspaper war claim journalists on the other tabloid bought shares before they were tipped in the hope that their recommendation would bring in more buyers and send the price soaring.</p> <p>Tipping comes in all shapes and sizes from the 32p a day Mirror with its two million plus circulation to specialist publications with subscription-only sales amounting to a few hundred. These can charge \u00a3500 a year or more.</p> <p>Marketmakers say newspaper and tipsheet recommendations have no effect on leading Footsie companies such as BT or Glaxo Wellcome. But tips do affect small companies, currently the favourite hunting ground of the new breed of internet investor. It takes only a few buyers, perhaps with no more than a few thousand pounds between them, to push a price sharply higher in a rarely traded share. And that often pulls in other investors.</p> <p>But tips could be part of a \"pump and dump\" exercise where holders of a share put out buy recommendations, often suggesting the price will soar - the \"pump\" - hoping to sucker in others who will buy their unwanted shares - the \"dump\".</p> <p>This week, the Financial Services Authority announced the formation of an e-commerce team to monitor tipping on the net.</p> <p>The Motley Fool (<a href=\"http://www.fool.co.uk),\" target=\"_NEW\">www.fool.co.uk),</a> which has held informal talks with the FSA, has message boards where members can pin up their thoughts. It is unregulated. The Fool's David Berger believes universal access to the net is an important safeguard.</p> <p>He says: \"Our whispers are in public, unlike those of City insiders, so ours can be challenged. We can track messages to e-mail addresses, although we do not demand identity checks or addresses to register as a member. But we encourage members to use our problem post and 'fool alerts' which we think are unique.\"</p> <p>The FSA's current rules to prevent conflicts of interest among print media tipsters are confused. It only controls some, as part of its regulation of \"investment advice\" - a term which includes tips on equities, unit and investment trusts or bonds but not savings accounts with banks and building societies.</p> <p>Writers on mainstream publications, whose primary purpose is wider than share tipping, do not need authorisation under the \"freedom of the press\" exemption.</p> <p>Sara Williams, who publishes the subscription only Growth Company Investor and a number of tipsheets, is covered by regulation. She says: \"I had to pass financial and investment planning exams to qualify. I insist that all writers sign a letter pledging to report any conflict of interest, such as holding a share which they tip. This will then be noted in the publication. Writers have to wait 48 hours after readers get the publication before they can deal.\"</p> <p>Andrew Griffiths, who publishes three share advice sheets including the AIM Newsletter, spends around \u00a35,000 a year on regulation and compulsory professional indemnity insurance.</p> <p>He says: \"I have to follow the rules. We cannot make exaggerated claims in our marketing. But there is nothing in the Financial Services Act about owning shares you then tip. Our writers are entitled to buy any shares they tip at the same time readers receive the publication. And if they mention them subsequently, they do not have to reveal ownership.\"</p> <p>Griffiths reckons tipsheet owners have either to employ writers who own no shares or those who put their money where their mouth is, using their experiences of winning and losing. He prefers the second variety.</p> <p>Shares, a weekly bookstall magazine, is not regulated. But it warns: \"Staff may hold shares in some of the securities written about in this magazine. All shareholdings will be disclosed where it [sic] may represent a conflict of interest.\" A Shares writer says this does not involve revealing whether the holder has one share or a million. Nor does the Shares code cover writers who suppress stories unfavourable to shares they own.</p> <p>The Investors Chronicle takes a tougher line. Managing director Michael Murphy says: \"You are not allowed to buy a share you have written about and you are not allowed to write about a share you own. Everyone has to register their shareholdings and regularly update them. This rule covers everyone. We also warn printers and distributors that they must not deal ahead of the Friday morning publication.\"</p> <p>But tipsheet writers think regulation is toothless. One says: \"The authorities are fools. There's a lot of insider trading and front running in small illiquid stocks. There are so many areas of leakage from bankers to secretaries. The FSA is not interested in tipping.\"</p> <p>But whatever the source of the tip, it is well to be aware of an old City saying: \"Where there's the tip, there's a tap\". This means that investors need to check why a share is being recommended before taking action. The motives can range from an honest desire to tell readers something they might not otherwise discover to an illegal attempt to \"ramp\" the shares by spreading false hopes about a stock in the hope that enough buyers will come in to ensure the price rises. Those connected with the company, including directors, brokers, bankers and public relations agents, may also place stories with tipsters, either to help their clients or to ensure they have a firm price into which they can sell stock.</p> <p>But some shares jump ahead without a single buyer - marketmakers subscribe to all the tipsheets and share magazines and often mark up the price of shares which are tipped. \"If we think there is going to be a lot of demand, we increase the price of the share in the hope of flushing out sellers. We're protecting our own position while making the tipper look clever,\" says a marketmaker.</p> <p><b>Choosing your tipsheet</b></p> <p>* Look at the past record.

      "bodyText": "Share tipping has become big business with scores of newsletters, magazines and newspaper columns aimed at experienced investors and first-time punters attracted by rocketing prices in dot.com and hi-tech companies. And that's not counting the financial chat rooms where stock aficionados swap market gossip with one another. But the battle between the Mirror and the Sun, and their mutual accusations of dirty dealing, have revealed the murky side of share tipping. Both sides in this redtop newspaper war claim journalists on the other tabloid bought shares before they were tipped in the hope that their recommendation would bring in more buyers and send the price soaring. Tipping comes in all shapes and sizes from the 32p a day Mirror with its two million plus circulation to specialist publications with subscription-only sales amounting to a few hundred. These can charge \u00a3500 a year or more. Marketmakers say newspaper and tipsheet recommendations have no effect on leading Footsie companies such as BT or Glaxo Wellcome. But tips do affect small companies, currently the favourite hunting ground of the new breed of internet investor. It takes only a few buyers, perhaps with no more than a few thousand pounds between them, to push a price sharply higher in a rarely traded share. And that often pulls in other investors. But tips could be part of a \"pump and dump\" exercise where holders of a share put out buy recommendations, often suggesting the price will soar - the \"pump\" - hoping to sucker in others who will buy their unwanted shares - the \"dump\". This week, the Financial Services Authority announced the formation of an e-commerce team to monitor tipping on the net. The Motley Fool (www.fool.co.uk), which has held informal talks with the FSA, has message boards where members can pin up their thoughts. It is unregulated. The Fool's David Berger believes universal access to the net is an important safeguard. He says: \"Our whispers are in public, unlike those of City insiders, so ours can be challenged. We can track messages to e-mail addresses, although we do not demand identity checks or addresses to register as a member. But we encourage members to use our problem post and 'fool alerts' which we think are unique.\" The FSA's current rules to prevent conflicts of interest among print media tipsters are confused. It only controls some, as part of its regulation of \"investment advice\" - a term which includes tips on equities, unit and investment trusts or bonds but not savings accounts with banks and building societies. Writers on mainstream publications, whose primary purpose is wider than share tipping, do not need authorisation under the \"freedom of the press\" exemption. Sara Williams, who publishes the subscription only Growth Company Investor and a number of tipsheets, is covered by regulation. She says: \"I had to pass financial and investment planning exams to qualify. I insist that all writers sign a letter pledging to report any conflict of interest, such as holding a share which they tip. This will then be noted in the publication. Writers have to wait 48 hours after readers get the publication before they can deal.\" Andrew Griffiths, who publishes three share advice sheets including the AIM Newsletter, spends around \u00a35,000 a year on regulation and compulsory professional indemnity insurance. He says: \"I have to follow the rules. We cannot make exaggerated claims in our marketing. But there is nothing in the Financial Services Act about owning shares you then tip. Our writers are entitled to buy any shares they tip at the same time readers receive the publication. And if they mention them subsequently, they do not have to reveal ownership.\" Griffiths reckons tipsheet owners have either to employ writers who own no shares or those who put their money where their mouth is, using their experiences of winning and losing. He prefers the second variety. Shares, a weekly bookstall magazine, is not regulated. But it warns: \"Staff may hold shares in some of the securities written about in this magazine. All shareholdings will be disclosed where it [sic] may represent a conflict of interest.\" A Shares writer says this does not involve revealing whether the holder has one share or a million. Nor does the Shares code cover writers who suppress stories unfavourable to shares they own. The Investors Chronicle takes a tougher line. Managing director Michael Murphy says: \"You are not allowed to buy a share you have written about and you are not allowed to write about a share you own. Everyone has to register their shareholdings and regularly update them. This rule covers everyone. We also warn printers and distributors that they must not deal ahead of the Friday morning publication.\" But tipsheet writers think regulation is toothless. One says: \"The authorities are fools. There's a lot of insider trading and front running in small illiquid stocks. There are so many areas of leakage from bankers to secretaries. The FSA is not interested in tipping.\" But whatever the source of the tip, it is well to be aware of an old City saying: \"Where there's the tip, there's a tap\". This means that investors need to check why a share is being recommended before taking action. The motives can range from an honest desire to tell readers something they might not otherwise discover to an illegal attempt to \"ramp\" the shares by spreading false hopes about a stock in the hope that enough buyers will come in to ensure the price rises. Those connected with the company, including directors, brokers, bankers and public relations agents, may also place stories with tipsters, either to help their clients or to ensure they have a firm price into which they can sell stock. But some shares jump ahead without a single buyer - marketmakers subscribe to all the tipsheets and share magazines and often mark up the price of shares which are tipped. \"If we think there is going to be a lot of demand, we increase the price of the share in the hope of flushing out sellers. We're protecting our own position while making the tipper look clever,\" says a marketmaker. Choosing your tipsheet * Look at the past record. Many sheets boast about successes but forget flops. * Compare their claimed growth rate against the markets they specialise in. Small companies and AIM stocks did well last year. * Does the tipster employ a scattergun approach, recommending scores of shares each issue? * Watch out for boasts based on the middle price between the offer price (at which you buy) and the bid (at which you sell). Ignoring this \"spread\", dealing costs and stamp duty means claims of bigger than deserved gains. * Is there a large \"free float\" - easily available shares to purchase rather those held by directors and their friends? Some tipsheets have boasted of turning \u00a310,000 into \u00a31m when it was not possible to buy even \u00a310,000 worth. * Does the tipster repeatedly recommend stocks associated with one broker or entrepreneur? * Is there sensible and regular \"sell\" advice?",

      "body": "<p>It's the DVD (digital versatile disc) everyone's been anticipating and desperately wanting to get their hands on,\" proclaims the press release from movie distributor Path\u00e9. The item in question is low-budget horror hit The Blair Witch Project, which arrives on the new home entertainment format on April 17, priced \u00a319.99.</p> <p>But what the release doesn't mention is that you don't need to wait until April to get your hands on a DVD copy of the film, or pay \u00a319.99. If you scour the specialist retailers or know where to look on the internet you can pick up The Blair Witch Project in the UK right now for just \u00a316.99.</p> <p>It's a similar story with the Will Smith blockbuster Wild Wild West. This comes out on DVD in this country on February 21, with a likely recommended retail price of \u00a319.99, but can already be found in a few places for \u00a314.99.</p> <p>So what's going on? How come a movie that's not yet available is available, and why such a difference in prices?</p> <p>What's going on is that the long-suffering UK public are once again getting a raw deal. In the wake of the furore over cars, designer goods and CDs, DVD is the latest manifestation of rip-off Britain.</p> <p>The villain in this saga of greed and global domination is Hollywood itself, which is attempting to control the way we watch its products on DVD. But there are ways of short-circuiting its efforts to restrict our viewing pleasure.</p> <p>Many experts are predicting that DVD will kill off the video cassette player in just a few years' time. It represents a giant technological leap forward from VHS, with CD-sized discs that can hold up to 266 minutes of digital-quality film and CD-quality sound. There's no more rewinding and you can instantly access different scenes of a movie. DVD, launched in Japan three years ago, arrived in this country in 1998, but has only really taken off during the last few months. Around 90,000 DVD players were snapped up in December alone, lifting the total sold so far in the UK to 250,000.</p> <p>There have been some teething problems with the new technology - some discs, notably sci-fi hit The Matrix, won't play on some players. But what has really got the goat of many movie fans is \"regional coding\" - the Hollywood-imposed system specifically designed to prevent UK DVD owners from watching discs from outside their \"region\".</p> <p>\"The system was set in place by the Hollywood studios, who only agreed to support the DVD format on the condition that they could impose some kind of control over release dates and distribution for the software,\" explains Chris Jenkins, editor of the monthly magazine Total DVD. \"They divided the planet into six regions, or zones - America is Region 1 and Europe is Region 2.\"</p> <p>With films usually showing in America months before they arrive in the UK the studios wanted to avoid a situation where people outside the US were able to watch a movie on DVD before they had paid money to see it at the cinema. So discs and players are encoded for a specific region, the aim being that discs from America can't play in places such as the UK, and vice versa.</p> <p>That would seem fair enough if everyone was able to get access to the same discs - but they're not. Our friends in America have a much larger choice of films than we do - there are currently less than 1,000 Region 2 discs available compared to almost 5,000 Region 1 discs. Region 1 DVDs come out months earlier - Double Jeopardy and Stigmata, both currently playing in UK cinemas, will be available on Region 1 disc from the end of this month, and pre-orders are already being taken for the R1 disc of Oscar-tipped drama American Beauty, which has only just opened here.</p> <p>And Region 1 films are cheaper too. The Blair Witch Project and Wild Wild West are two examples of this, with R1 discs of these films on sale here for up to 25% less than their belated UK counterparts. To add insult to injury, R1 DVDs often include extra features such as deleted scenes and making-of documentaries not found on their Region 2 equivalents.</p> <p>So it's no surprise that disgruntled movie fans are finding ways of cracking the regional codes in order to allow some UK players to play American discs.</p> <p>If you think that hacking into your DVD player in order to alter its settings sounds both illegal and highly technical, you'd be wrong. With some of the players on sale here, rejigging them so they can play R1 discs couldn't be easier - all you have to do is type in a series of numbers or commands using the remote control.

      "bodyText": "It's the DVD (digital versatile disc) everyone's been anticipating and desperately wanting to get their hands on,\" proclaims the press release from movie distributor Path\u00e9. The item in question is low-budget horror hit The Blair Witch Project, which arrives on the new home entertainment format on April 17, priced \u00a319.99. But what the release doesn't mention is that you don't need to wait until April to get your hands on a DVD copy of the film, or pay \u00a319.99. If you scour the specialist retailers or know where to look on the internet you can pick up The Blair Witch Project in the UK right now for just \u00a316.99. It's a similar story with the Will Smith blockbuster Wild Wild West. This comes out on DVD in this country on February 21, with a likely recommended retail price of \u00a319.99, but can already be found in a few places for \u00a314.99. So what's going on? How come a movie that's not yet available is available, and why such a difference in prices? What's going on is that the long-suffering UK public are once again getting a raw deal. In the wake of the furore over cars, designer goods and CDs, DVD is the latest manifestation of rip-off Britain. The villain in this saga of greed and global domination is Hollywood itself, which is attempting to control the way we watch its products on DVD. But there are ways of short-circuiting its efforts to restrict our viewing pleasure. Many experts are predicting that DVD will kill off the video cassette player in just a few years' time. It represents a giant technological leap forward from VHS, with CD-sized discs that can hold up to 266 minutes of digital-quality film and CD-quality sound. There's no more rewinding and you can instantly access different scenes of a movie. DVD, launched in Japan three years ago, arrived in this country in 1998, but has only really taken off during the last few months. Around 90,000 DVD players were snapped up in December alone, lifting the total sold so far in the UK to 250,000. There have been some teething problems with the new technology - some discs, notably sci-fi hit The Matrix, won't play on some players. But what has really got the goat of many movie fans is \"regional coding\" - the Hollywood-imposed system specifically designed to prevent UK DVD owners from watching discs from outside their \"region\". \"The system was set in place by the Hollywood studios, who only agreed to support the DVD format on the condition that they could impose some kind of control over release dates and distribution for the software,\" explains Chris Jenkins, editor of the monthly magazine Total DVD. \"They divided the planet into six regions, or zones - America is Region 1 and Europe is Region 2.\" With films usually showing in America months before they arrive in the UK the studios wanted to avoid a situation where people outside the US were able to watch a movie on DVD before they had paid money to see it at the cinema. So discs and players are encoded for a specific region, the aim being that discs from America can't play in places such as the UK, and vice versa. That would seem fair enough if everyone was able to get access to the same discs - but they're not. Our friends in America have a much larger choice of films than we do - there are currently less than 1,000 Region 2 discs available compared to almost 5,000 Region 1 discs. Region 1 DVDs come out months earlier - Double Jeopardy and Stigmata, both currently playing in UK cinemas, will be available on Region 1 disc from the end of this month, and pre-orders are already being taken for the R1 disc of Oscar-tipped drama American Beauty, which has only just opened here. And Region 1 films are cheaper too. The Blair Witch Project and Wild Wild West are two examples of this, with R1 discs of these films on sale here for up to 25% less than their belated UK counterparts. To add insult to injury, R1 DVDs often include extra features such as deleted scenes and making-of documentaries not found on their Region 2 equivalents. So it's no surprise that disgruntled movie fans are finding ways of cracking the regional codes in order to allow some UK players to play American discs. If you think that hacking into your DVD player in order to alter its settings sounds both illegal and highly technical, you'd be wrong. With some of the players on sale here, rejigging them so they can play R1 discs couldn't be easier - all you have to do is type in a series of numbers or commands using the remote control.

The United States blamed both Hizbullah and Syria for the setback. James Rubin, the US state department spokesman, said the attack was a \"deliberate disruption\" of the international meeting. Syria had influence over Hizbullah, he added, and should have exerted it \"more effectively\". The Hizbullah attack targeted an Israeli position at Beaufort castle, a crusader fortress in the central sector of Israel's self-styled \"security zone\" in south Lebanon. The latest Israeli fatality - the seventh in less than three weeks - triggered a swift riposte from Israeli aircraft and artillery, which struck at the outskirts of several villages just north of the zone. It also prompted the Israeli delegation to storm out of the meeting of the monitoring group. This body, which meets regularly at the headquarters of the UN interim force in Lebanon (Unifil) in the village of Naqoura, in Israeli-occupied Lebanon, comprises representatives of the US and France - its co-founders - Israel, Lebanon and Syria. It was born out of the US-brokered understandings of April 1996, which prohibit attacks on or from civilian areas - reached after an Israeli blitz in which at least 175 Lebanese were killed. \"The official plenary meeting did not take place,\" said a Franco-US statement. \"The co-chairs were informed by the Israeli delegate that, due to military actions on the ground earlier today, their delegation has been instructed to return to Israel.\" The Israeli delegation had been expected to press at the meeting for a change in the \"rules\" of warfare in south Lebanon, prohibiting Hizbullah attacks on Israeli soldiers in the security zone. The Lebanese prime minister, Salim al-Hoss, had flatly rejected this proposal, which, as the Lebanese see it, would be tantamount to authorising Israel to launch attacks on civilian infrastructure whenever Hizbullah killed its soldiers. Mr Hoss also strongly criticised the US for what he described as bias, taking issue with a remark made by the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, that in destroying Lebanese power stations Israel had merely been sending \"a very strong signal\" that the Israelis \"don't want this escalation\". \"How does any country allow itself to send signals through destroying infrastructure and attacking civilians?\" Mr Hoss said. Meanwhile, Hizbullah vowed to fight on, no matter what. It said the \"April understandings\" enshrined \"the full right of the resistance movement to go after enemy troops in the occupied zone\", and it would \"never accept a change in the rules of the game\". It also reserved the right to launch Katyusha rockets against targets in northern Israel in response to any attacks on Lebanese civilians. In Jerusalem the army confirmed yesterday's air strikes and Israeli casualties. An announcement said Sergeant Zachi Yitah, 19, was killed and another soldier seriously wounded when a missile hit a combat trench. Washington is concerned that the fighting in south Lebanon will escalate, complicating US attempts to bring Israel and Syria back to the negotiating table. Israeli and Syrian delegations spent more than a week at peace talks in west Virginia last month but left without progress on the Golan heights, Syrian territory captured by Israel in the 1967 war.",

      "body": "<p>Once upon a time, not so very long ago, there lived little girls and little boys who skipped and jumped and hopped and laughed and played together. Snails, sugar, spice and all things nice, that's what these little children were made of. We told them stories and tucked them up in bed at night, warmed by the certainty that the only monsters were in their storybooks. Childhood was an enchanted place that we all believed in. But this story doesn't have a happy ending: our cherubs aren't gently sent to the Land of Nod with a soft lullaby. In this story, our children become changelings, their chubby faces distorted and menacing. The little boy tucked in bed is no longer to be trusted. He's a harasser, an abuser, a sexual predator. He indecently assaults, masturbates, rapes and buggers other children. Childhood is no longer a fairy-tale haven. We are being asked to believe in something far worse than any wicked fairy - that there's a silent, violent epidemic of children sexually abusing other children.</p> <p>The NSPCC calculates that 40% of abuse on children is committed by other children, \"and the true scale is much deeper than that\". Kids just aren't kids any more. Boys won't just be boys; they'll be mini monstrous men. The NSPCC warns that \"too many young abusers are slipping through the net. There has got to be a major education campaign to make sure that professionals - social workers, the teaching and medical professions, and others - are properly informed about the abuse of children by other children so that their behaviour is not dismissed as 'horseplay' or 'natural experimentation'.\"</p> <p>These abusive acts are not confined to teenage tearaways, overcome by a surge of pubescent testosterone. Last weekend an 11-year-old was arrested in Lincolnshire on suspicion of raping a 12-year-old girl. \"There are more and more referrals from younger children - six-, seven-, eight-year-olds are not uncommon. Our experience tells us that children as young as five are sexually abusing,\" says the NSPCC, listing sadism, fetishism, cross-dressing, masturbation, exhibitionism, voyeurism, zoophilia (sex with animals) and \"digital and object penetration\" as the types of activities that even kindergarten kids engage in. In an adult attempt at a remedy, there are almost 50 centres throughout the country dedicated to the new field of tackling \"sexually inappropriate behaviour\" in adolescents and young people. And every week, another child is taken to court charged with rape or indecent assault on another child. In 1997, the last available statistics, more than 1,000 young people were found guilty of or cautioned for sexual offences. There is no way of calculating how many are currently on the Sex Offenders Register; there are probably around 200.</p> <p>In this new, unsettling moral universe, is our children's normal sexual development being criminalised? Does touching your sister's genitals, once, become an abusive act? Is experimentation between children being unnecessarily seen as a mighty problem that needs to be tackled? Is an over-zealous interest in Postman's Knock really the signature of an apprentice paedophile? Is French kissing another six-year-old assault? Is \"show me yours and I'll show you mine\" a sexually inappropriate request? Is the unimaginable really happening in the enchanted land? Is this the end of innocence?</p> <p>Johnny R is 10 years old. He supports Manchester United, plays midfield for the local under-11s, watches snooker on TV and wants a Sega Dreamcast for his birthday. He has also been on the Sex Offenders Register. Last August, Johnny was convicted of indecent assault. His alleged victim was a neighbour who lived opposite him in their wide suburban street, where all the houses have front and back gardens. They were in the same class at primary school. She liked to play goalie to his midfield, using a bike as a goalpost.</p> <p>Then, one day, when they were playing football together on a local building site, up past the smart new show-homes, she ran home to her Mum. \"I asked her what was wrong, and she burst into tears,\" says her mother, Mrs S. \"She went on to say that Johnny had pulled down her pants and touched her. I asked her again what was wrong, what happened. She said Johnny had touched her where she wees.\"</p> <p>The \"victim\", Nicky S, was eight years old. Johnny, small and blond, was first charged with rape - the youngest person ever to be so - though this was later reduced to indecent assault. It took until November to clear his name.</p> <p>It was Cup Final day last May. Johnny's story is this: \"We were watching United, and Eric [his best friend] knocked on the door and said, 'Do you want a game of football?' and I said, 'Yes'. And Nicky was playing on her bike. And Nicky came up to us and said, 'Can I play football?' I said, 'No, you can't.' I just said no. Then Eric said, 'Go on, then, let her.' We went up to the building site and just played a game of football until Nicky came and she put her bike down. I was sweating and I lied on the floor for about five minutes. She jumped on me, just jumped on me, playing. She bounced on me. When Eric got on the floor, he was sweating and all, she jumped on top of him. I said, 'Get off him. Get off him.' And Eric said, 'Get off me.' And she went up to the fence and she climbed over the top, it was all pointy, and when she got to the top she ripped her knickers, and when she got down she looked at her knickers, and she went home to her Mum crying. She blamed it all on me. I was her friend for a very long time, but she's not my friend any more.\"</p> <p>I met this Lilliputian sex offender in his grandmother's spick-and-span house. There was a constant burr from the washing machine. Nana R was endlessly wiping smudges of chocolate from her grandchildren's faces and her pea-green, velveteen three-piece suite. Although the house was full of children, it was an obsessively clean home. She hasn't been back to work at the supermarket since her grandson's arrest, and now spends her days dusting and polishing. \"I didn't used to be like this,\" she says. Johnny was feeding his baby sister a bottle filled with Coca-Cola and pulling funny faces, making her gurgle. He has one of those young boy mouths that are always slightly open, giving him the appearance of being in permanent shock. And he was dressed in a 10-year-old's kit of football top, track-suit bottoms with poppers up the sides, and trainers, not the cheap kind, but a proper brand name.</p> <p>Mrs R, Johnny's mother, is chain-smoking, her hands shaking with anxiety and anger. She has cut and dyed her hair into a blond bob since the trial, in the hope that fewer people will recognise her. \"He was arrested, read his rights, and led down to the cells, like an animal, for rape,\" she says. I asked Johnny, \"Did you know what rape was?\" He looks bemused, confused: \"No.\" His mother interrupts: \"They asked him in the first interview if he got an erection. He just looked at me and said, 'What's that?' They asked him questions, and sometimes they had to rearrange them because he didn't understand. They finger-printed him. They even had to stand him on a box for the photograph, because he wasn't tall enough.\"</p> <p>Johnny was bailed to his grandparents'. \"He wanted to know why he couldn't go home to his mum,\" says Nana R. \"He cried to go home. We had to explain to him that he must never leave this house and go home, even if he wants to. It's only about 10 minutes away, walking, only two roads, five minutes on his bike. He can't go out unless there's a grown-up with him. We found it a bit hard, really. Because the children he was used to around here - there was about eight of them - they'd all play football together. I don't want the children knocking on the door asking if he can go out and play. There's only so many excuses you can make. And then they start saying, 'Why can't he play?' We had to have a social worker here for two hours on a Sunday, so he could mix with his brother and sister. And if he went upstairs to play on his Play Station, this social worker had to go up and follow him.\"</p> <p>At his trial three months later, Johnny R was found guilty of indecent assault on Nicky S. He was placed under a three-year supervision order. He hadn't been at lessons since the Cup Final, as he would have had to share a classroom with his former friend. Johnny passed his days watching snooker on TV and waiting for the normal pattern of his life to resume - school, football, playing in the street with his mates.</p> <p>On the R family's tight, neat estate, gossip inevitably flies as freely as the kids' footballs. \"This is a very small town, so everything goes round,\" says Mrs R. \"Every child in that school knows. You'd be able to see that doubt in them.\" I ask Johnny to show me his Sex Offenders Register form; he called it \"that list, sex offenders thing\", and obviously had no idea what it meant. He found it quickly, by the mock-antique phone; everything is so ordered at Nana's. His name was written on it, and the simple words \"Indecent Assault on Female Under 16\". Then he put \"that list\" back in its registered envelope and went off to play on the Fischer Price \"Talk to Teddy\" phone. \"It's Granddad! It's Granddad!\" he pretends to his little sister.</p> <p>Johnny R was only 10, but that didn't stop him being categorised as an abuser. In the language of the sex-offender treatment-practitioners, Johnny was a \"denier\". Such children, it is believed, simply refuse to admit the true extent of the harm that they have caused. However hard a child protests the innocence of their actions, that they were just mucking around, it's not accepted. \"You expect people to deny at first,\" says Mark Dalton, team manager of the NSPCC's Midlands Project for Young People With Inappropriate Sexual Behaviour. \"Why would they admit? People deny the intent or seriousness of it, or aspects of the responsibility. They say he was leading me on. You only admit to get it over and done with. And it's not a question of simply going, 'It's a fair cop, Guv. I did it.' We want the emotion that goes with that.\"</p> <p>Projects have been established throughout Britain, by probation services, children's services and young-offender units, to enable young abusers to come to terms with what they have done, to have that \"emotion\". There are 18 NSPCC young-abuser projects throughout the country, with 12 more planned, \"to stop young abusers becoming the serial paedophiles in the future\". They provide sessions of individual or group therapy, over a period of three months to a year, designed to make the children \"address their abusive behaviour\", increase \"victim empathy\" (ie understand how hurtful it is to be abused by them) and motivate them to change, \"to replace anti-social thoughts and behaviour with more positive ones\".</p> <p>This is a new and burgeoning professional field. At a recent National Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers (NOTA) conference on Effective Research And Protective Practice, in York, there were more than 400 participants who work with sex offenders. Twelve workshops focused on young abusers, from Family Therapy with Incarcerated Young Sex Offenders to Focused Group Treatment for Sexually Acting Out Boys Aged 10-15 Years. The consensus among the participants was that \"sexually inappropriate behaviour\" generally begins between the ages of six and seven, and that it will have happened many times before it is detected, usually years later. The orthodoxy goes that, for each reported incident, there are scores more unreported. This is the model that would be applied to Johnny R.</p> <p>In this messy landscape of children's sexual development, measuring what is inappropriate is not a simple task. A recent referral to Dalton's Project For Young People With Inappropriate Sexual Behaviour is a seven-year-old who rubbed Smarties on his penis and fed them to a younger child. There is still no benchmark of \"appropriate\" behaviour against which such actions can be assessed. Health trust ethical committees are understandably reluctant for any research on children's sexual development to be carried out on their patch. Children's emerging sexuality remains an area of which we adults are simply ignorant. John Coleman, director of the Trust for the Study of Adolescents, says, \"What is normal? We don't know. We don't have the research to tell us. It's absurd how little concrete information we've got when it's so important and has so many implications. We don't know what is actually happening out there.\"</p> <p>Of course, there are indisputable cases of abuse. The Sex Offender Unit at Middlesex Probation Service has worked with gang rapists, abductors and stalkers, all in their early teens. Marcus Erooga, an NSPCC team manager and co-editor of the recently published Children And Young People Who Sexually Abuse Others: Challenges And Responses, argues that the area of what counts as abuse is not as fuzzy as it might seem. \"There's a very tight definition,\" he says. \"Inappropriate and non-consensual. It's quite explicit, deliberate, sexual acts.\"</p> <p>Our confusion arises from our refusal to take abuse by children seriously. What would count as clear abuse if perpetrated on a child by an adult is often not seen as such when the perpetrator is a child themselves. \"There's a myth that goes around that if a child has been abused by another child, it's not that bad,\" says Anne Blues, team manager of the NSPCC/Barnado's project Kaleidoscope, which specialises in treating very young children \"whose sexual behaviour harms others\". Kaleidoscope is \"pro-active\" in trying to get girl abusers, in particular, referred to them. \"Girls are defined as promiscuous when they're actually abusive,\" says Blues. \"And the boys won't tell you, because the overriding feeling is, 'Aren't they lucky'.\"</p> <p>But beyond obvious examples, there lies a hinterland of sexual activity where such certainties founder. Last March, Cheynes Infant School in Luton banned the playground game Kiss Chase because it involved \"unwanted physical attention\" and the \"exchange of bodily fluids\" (ie saliva). Headteacher Maureen Fitzgerald wrote a letter to parents explaining that she considered the game, with small children putting their tongues in each other's mouths, \"inappropriate behaviour\". Some believe that Doctors And Nurses will be next.</p> <p>Ann Furedi, columnist and director of communications at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, says that adults are unnecessarily proscribing childish actions. \"I believe children will explore their body, their genitals, and ask questions in an entirely unembarrassed and unawkward way, without really placing it in a sexual context. We then look at this through a particular prism. Increasingly, there's a tendency to interpret what would have been seen as quite innocent activities as being loaded with a sexual context.\"</p> <p>When is an act by a child sexual at all, rather than plain, old-fashioned bad behaviour? Marcus Erooga insists that, even if the child doesn't understand the notion of sexual and gets no sexual gratification from their actions, it should still be seen as sexual abuse. \"The reason that it's important that the word sexual remains there, whatever the motivation, is because the behaviour still has a sexual component and is likely to continue to effect their sexual development if not addressed,\" he says. In one recent case, an 11-year-old boy was convicted of assaulting a two-year-old relative. Her mother had called the police when she found him lying naked with her daughter. Although the boy pleaded guilty, a doctor's report was accepted by the judge that concluded he suffered from Attention Deficit Disorder and there was \"no clear evidence that sexual motivation was a part of this incident\". Nevertheless, the 11-year-old was placed on the Sex Offenders Register for 30 months.</p> <p>Increasingly, younger and younger children are being defined as sexual abusers. Anne Blues's youngest client was three years old. \"She was excluded from nursery for masturbating and for using implements on other children - pencils and things. She obviously didn't understand what she was doing, but she was doing things to other children and they did not want her to. It's important not to label children, but we have to describe the behaviour.\" But, unlike other childish crimes - pick-pocketing, shoplifting, joyriding - the argument is not simply whether the young person did it or not. The argument is whether what they did actually caused harm and was morally wrong. Once, God and Mother provided signposts through this murky emotional landscape. That job is being increasingly handed over to the young abuser professionals who decide what is acceptable and what is not. There's an understandable desire among these experts to get to grips with the grey area of nascent sexual development. They want to draw up some harder and faster rules.</p> <p>Attempts to codify \"appropriate sexual behaviour\" in children began in the US where, just 15 years ago, there was no such thing as a treatment programme for sexually-abusive kids. By 1996, there were 50 residential and 396 non-residential programmes for sex offenders under the age of 12. These centres needed clear-cut categories applied to the emotional mess of children's emerging sexuality.</p> <p>A plethora of handbooks were published, advising parents, teachers, health-care workers and children themselves what was \"appropriate sexual behaviour\". The most popular was Flirting Or Hurting?, first published in 1994 and selling more than 20,000 copies. This book charts the differences between flirting and harassment. Flirting, it suggests, includes comments such as, \"Like your hair\" and \"You look nice\". Harassment might be lip-licking and the very same phrase that might, with another tone of voice or facial expression, be appropriate: \"You look nice.\"</p> <p>But even in a society that believes it is having some success in codifying \"normal\" sexual behaviour, there is furious debate. In the autumn of 1996 in Lexington, North Carolina, first-grader Johnathan Prevette was punished for giving a classmate a peck on the cheek. The boy's defence - that the girl had asked for a kiss - was not accepted. His punishment included being forced to miss an ice-cream party for children with good attendance records.</p> <p>The six-year-old Prevette became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, and members of his family were invited on to TV chatshows as honoured guests. Jane Martin, a spokesperson for the school district, declared, \"A six-year-old kissing another six-year-old is inappropriate behaviour. Unwelcome is unwelcome at any age.\" She went on to point out that the rules on sexual harassment were clearly set out in a handbook.</p> <p>Few adults share this clear-cut sense of boundaries beyond which a child must not tread. The recent collapse of a case against 11-year-old Swiss boy Raoul Wuthrich, accused by a neighbour in Colorado of touching his five-year-old sister \"in an inappropriate way\" while helping her pee in the garden, demonstrates how difficult it is to set clear guidelines. Yet, whatever the uncertainties, it inevitably and rightly falls on us adults to guide and police children's sexual development. According to former teacher Neil Duncan, senior lecturer in education at the University of Wolverhampton and author of Sexual Bullying, we are seeing a teenage world through the prism of adult eyes: \"Staff have come to me to report 'disgusting' things they've heard about bodily fluids [semen] - the last taboo. You go along and speak to the kids, who say it was 'just a laugh'. That's all it meant. We're so uptight about the sexual behaviour of children that any contact can be reconstituted in terms of peer child abuse.\"</p> <p>Once the decision is reached that an act of abuse has occurred, the child is then judged a deviant. The NSPCC believes that he or she may well be an adult sex offender in the making. \"Paedophiles don't wake up at 23,\" they argue. \"We know adult paedophiles start fantasising sexual interest in children as adolescents.\"</p> <p>But not all young abuser professionals believe that there is an inevitable slippery slope from teenage groping to adult offending. \"The received wisdom 10 years ago was that if you didn't help people stop, they would never stop, and that juvenile abusers were just adult abusers in training. But that just doesn't stand up,\" says Mark Dalton. \"The most usual experience we get is a young teenage boy who is in a caring role with a child he knows and it's a grope, it's a fondle, it's that sort of thing. We can't say that that 15-year-old is going to become the next Fred West.\" Alison Hadley, national policy officer at Brooks Advisory Service, makes a plea for adult tolerance of our adolescents. \"We have to remember that they're children, and are needing guidance and support. People forget that it's a steep learning curve in your teens, and you do make mistakes.\"</p> <p>Mistakes can be costly for today's teenagers. One Monday morning in June, Pete K's mother received a phone call from his Catholic secondary school asking her to come and take her son back home. A girl, 14, had reported that, while she was sitting next to him in class the previous Wednesday, Pete, also 14, had taken hold of her hand and put it on his crotch. She then said that he had placed his hand on her leg and moved it towards her crotch. Pete admitted taking her hand, but denied placing his hand on her leg. This was said to have happened during a French lesson, with 28 other children and a teacher present.</p> <p>The girl's father reported the incident and Mrs K was asked to take her son down to the police station, where he was arrested for indecent assault and cautioned. \"Fair enough, he did act inappropriately,\" she says. \"He signed the caution, and then out came the Sex Offenders Register.\" Even those who have simply accepted a caution are required to be registered for two-and-a-half years. The police did not make the K family or their solicitor aware of this requirement before they accepted the caution. \"When we were asked to sign the register, we refused,\" says Mrs K. \"First, they were going to arrest me for not compelling him to sign. Then him, for not signing.\"</p> <p>Two weeks later, Pete was permanently excluded from school, just over a year before he was due to sit his GCSEs. His younger sister was sent away to live with her father, out of the district, as a condition of him returning home. He was allowed supervised visits to see her once a week. \"To me as a normal person, he's done nothing different from what millions of teenagers do,\" says Mrs K. \"That's why I wouldn't sign it. If they put all these adolescents on the register, it will be a very big one. They want to put children by the side of paedophiles. There's something wrong.\"</p> <p>Johnny R's appeal date was set in early November, three months after his conviction. There were no wigs, few formalities, and the grey-haired judge leaned over his bench and said, \"If Johnny wants to break off to go to the loo or to stretch his legs, just let me know.\" But courtrooms are not child-friendly, and the ceiling, as high as a church, made Johnny, in a blue fleece jacket and jogging pants, seem even smaller. His mouth was still hanging open a little, perhaps wondering what this was all about. The R family were all dressed ferociously neatly, with oiled-back hair and fiercely ironed suits, as if the slightest crease would somehow make them crumble. Only a courtroom away, a woman was being convicted for murdering her children.</p> <p>The tape of the initial police interview with Nicky S was played. The woman police officer was very gentle with her, constantly reassuring, \"You're doing very well,\" and muttering a soft, \"Okay, Okay.\" (In contrast, when Johnny started crying, he was told sharply by the same police officer, \"I don't want you snivelling all through the interview.\") \"He's very fond of me, he does love me, but I don't love him,\" Nicky told the kind police lady. As this declaration played in court, the prosecuting solicitor took a pen out of her Winnie the Pooh pencil case. In this strange arena, what counted as childish and adult seemed to have become confused. When we watched the tape of Johnny's best friend, Eric, trying to describe what went on, he said Johnny \"fancied her . . . they've been dating each other\". His words trespassed into dangerous territory. To the grown-ups, they sounded far too adult for his age. Eric was nine.</p> <p>Nicky, a tiny Nike fashion plate, was cross-examined by video link. At one point, she buried her head entirely inside her T-shirt, so all we could see on the screen was a giant Nike tick. She began to cry, \"It's not my fault I can't remember things when I was little.\" Six months, when she was eight-and-three-quarters rather than nine, is an age ago for a small child.</p> <p>There were moments when the moral nature of this trial was all too clear. The police interrogated Johnny for a second time: \"What's a snog?\" asked the officer.</p> <p>\"I didn't ask her,\" whimpers Johnny.</p> <p>\"You didn't ask her for a snog?\"</p> <p>\"No.\"</p> <p>\"You don't know what that word means? Does it mean kiss?\"</p> <p>\"Yes.\"</p> <p>\"But you didn't ask her for a snog?\"</p> <p>\"No.\"</p> <p>And I can't help thinking, so what if he did. It's not a crime - and surely not \"inappropriate sexual behaviour\" - for a 10-year-old to ask a girl he works with in maths group for a snog. Ask for a snog, not force one on her. The prosecuting barrister pursued the suggestion that Johnny \"fancied\" Nicky, imputing adult desires and intentions to these young children. He questioned Johnny: \"You like Nicky very much, don't you?\" (Yes) \"You thought she was nice?\" (Yes). \"Did you love her?\" (No) \"You wanted to be her boyfriend?\" (No). It was as if this, this fumbling for adolescence, had itself become a crime.</p> <p>My impression was that all the children were terrified of all the adults - whether the softly-spoken police woman in the interview room, the barking barristers, or even their own families. All the little interviewees seemed to be desperately trying to give answers that wouldn't get them in trouble. They knew they'd done something that grown-ups didn't like. The words used by the adults in court to describe the children's genitals was \"rude bits\", and their alleged actions were \"messing with\" and \"naughty\". The message was clear: whatever these children were doing, if anything at all, the grown-ups thought it was dirty.</p> <p>But the grey-haired judge decided otherwise. It took him less than four minutes to decide: \"They had all played together on numerous occasions, and on some of these occasions there had been horseplay,\" he said. \"Are we sure the conduct was indecent? We've come to the conclusion that we cannot be sure.\" The case against the 10-year-old was overturned. Johnny R won his appeal. He's started going to a new school, making new friends to play football with. He's just had his 11th birthday party. He got his Sega Dreamcast.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Once upon a time, not so very long ago, there lived little girls and little boys who skipped and jumped and hopped and laughed and played together. Snails, sugar, spice and all things nice, that's what these little children were made of. We told them stories and tucked them up in bed at night, warmed by the certainty that the only monsters were in their storybooks. Childhood was an enchanted place that we all believed in. But this story doesn't have a happy ending: our cherubs aren't gently sent to the Land of Nod with a soft lullaby. In this story, our children become changelings, their chubby faces distorted and menacing. The little boy tucked in bed is no longer to be trusted. He's a harasser, an abuser, a sexual predator. He indecently assaults, masturbates, rapes and buggers other children. Childhood is no longer a fairy-tale haven. We are being asked to believe in something far worse than any wicked fairy - that there's a silent, violent epidemic of children sexually abusing other children. The NSPCC calculates that 40% of abuse on children is committed by other children, \"and the true scale is much deeper than that\". Kids just aren't kids any more. Boys won't just be boys; they'll be mini monstrous men. The NSPCC warns that \"too many young abusers are slipping through the net. There has got to be a major education campaign to make sure that professionals - social workers, the teaching and medical professions, and others - are properly informed about the abuse of children by other children so that their behaviour is not dismissed as 'horseplay' or 'natural experimentation'.\" These abusive acts are not confined to teenage tearaways, overcome by a surge of pubescent testosterone. Last weekend an 11-year-old was arrested in Lincolnshire on suspicion of raping a 12-year-old girl. \"There are more and more referrals from younger children - six-, seven-, eight-year-olds are not uncommon. Our experience tells us that children as young as five are sexually abusing,\" says the NSPCC, listing sadism, fetishism, cross-dressing, masturbation, exhibitionism, voyeurism, zoophilia (sex with animals) and \"digital and object penetration\" as the types of activities that even kindergarten kids engage in. In an adult attempt at a remedy, there are almost 50 centres throughout the country dedicated to the new field of tackling \"sexually inappropriate behaviour\" in adolescents and young people. And every week, another child is taken to court charged with rape or indecent assault on another child. In 1997, the last available statistics, more than 1,000 young people were found guilty of or cautioned for sexual offences. There is no way of calculating how many are currently on the Sex Offenders Register; there are probably around 200. In this new, unsettling moral universe, is our children's normal sexual development being criminalised? Does touching your sister's genitals, once, become an abusive act? Is experimentation between children being unnecessarily seen as a mighty problem that needs to be tackled? Is an over-zealous interest in Postman's Knock really the signature of an apprentice paedophile? Is French kissing another six-year-old assault? Is \"show me yours and I'll show you mine\" a sexually inappropriate request? Is the unimaginable really happening in the enchanted land? Is this the end of innocence? Johnny R is 10 years old. He supports Manchester United, plays midfield for the local under-11s, watches snooker on TV and wants a Sega Dreamcast for his birthday. He has also been on the Sex Offenders Register. Last August, Johnny was convicted of indecent assault. His alleged victim was a neighbour who lived opposite him in their wide suburban street, where all the houses have front and back gardens. They were in the same class at primary school. She liked to play goalie to his midfield, using a bike as a goalpost. Then, one day, when they were playing football together on a local building site, up past the smart new show-homes, she ran home to her Mum. \"I asked her what was wrong, and she burst into tears,\" says her mother, Mrs S. \"She went on to say that Johnny had pulled down her pants and touched her. I asked her again what was wrong, what happened. She said Johnny had touched her where she wees.\" The \"victim\", Nicky S, was eight years old. Johnny, small and blond, was first charged with rape - the youngest person ever to be so - though this was later reduced to indecent assault. It took until November to clear his name. It was Cup Final day last May. Johnny's story is this: \"We were watching United, and Eric [his best friend] knocked on the door and said, 'Do you want a game of football?' and I said, 'Yes'. And Nicky was playing on her bike. And Nicky came up to us and said, 'Can I play football?' I said, 'No, you can't.' I just said no. Then Eric said, 'Go on, then, let her.' We went up to the building site and just played a game of football until Nicky came and she put her bike down. I was sweating and I lied on the floor for about five minutes. She jumped on me, just jumped on me, playing. She bounced on me. When Eric got on the floor, he was sweating and all, she jumped on top of him. I said, 'Get off him. Get off him.' And Eric said, 'Get off me.' And she went up to the fence and she climbed over the top, it was all pointy, and when she got to the top she ripped her knickers, and when she got down she looked at her knickers, and she went home to her Mum crying. She blamed it all on me. I was her friend for a very long time, but she's not my friend any more.\" I met this Lilliputian sex offender in his grandmother's spick-and-span house. There was a constant burr from the washing machine. Nana R was endlessly wiping smudges of chocolate from her grandchildren's faces and her pea-green, velveteen three-piece suite. Although the house was full of children, it was an obsessively clean home. She hasn't been back to work at the supermarket since her grandson's arrest, and now spends her days dusting and polishing. \"I didn't used to be like this,\" she says. Johnny was feeding his baby sister a bottle filled with Coca-Cola and pulling funny faces, making her gurgle. He has one of those young boy mouths that are always slightly open, giving him the appearance of being in permanent shock. And he was dressed in a 10-year-old's kit of football top, track-suit bottoms with poppers up the sides, and trainers, not the cheap kind, but a proper brand name. Mrs R, Johnny's mother, is chain-smoking, her hands shaking with anxiety and anger. She has cut and dyed her hair into a blond bob since the trial, in the hope that fewer people will recognise her. \"He was arrested, read his rights, and led down to the cells, like an animal, for rape,\" she says. I asked Johnny, \"Did you know what rape was?\" He looks bemused, confused: \"No.\" His mother interrupts: \"They asked him in the first interview if he got an erection. He just looked at me and said, 'What's that?' They asked him questions, and sometimes they had to rearrange them because he didn't understand. They finger-printed him. They even had to stand him on a box for the photograph, because he wasn't tall enough.\" Johnny was bailed to his grandparents'. \"He wanted to know why he couldn't go home to his mum,\" says Nana R. \"He cried to go home. We had to explain to him that he must never leave this house and go home, even if he wants to. It's only about 10 minutes away, walking, only two roads, five minutes on his bike. He can't go out unless there's a grown-up with him. We found it a bit hard, really. Because the children he was used to around here - there was about eight of them - they'd all play football together. I don't want the children knocking on the door asking if he can go out and play. There's only so many excuses you can make. And then they start saying, 'Why can't he play?' We had to have a social worker here for two hours on a Sunday, so he could mix with his brother and sister. And if he went upstairs to play on his Play Station, this social worker had to go up and follow him.\" At his trial three months later, Johnny R was found guilty of indecent assault on Nicky S. He was placed under a three-year supervision order. He hadn't been at lessons since the Cup Final, as he would have had to share a classroom with his former friend. Johnny passed his days watching snooker on TV and waiting for the normal pattern of his life to resume - school, football, playing in the street with his mates. On the R family's tight, neat estate, gossip inevitably flies as freely as the kids' footballs. \"This is a very small town, so everything goes round,\" says Mrs R. \"Every child in that school knows. You'd be able to see that doubt in them.\" I ask Johnny to show me his Sex Offenders Register form; he called it \"that list, sex offenders thing\", and obviously had no idea what it meant. He found it quickly, by the mock-antique phone; everything is so ordered at Nana's. His name was written on it, and the simple words \"Indecent Assault on Female Under 16\". Then he put \"that list\" back in its registered envelope and went off to play on the Fischer Price \"Talk to Teddy\" phone. \"It's Granddad! It's Granddad!\" he pretends to his little sister. Johnny R was only 10, but that didn't stop him being categorised as an abuser. In the language of the sex-offender treatment-practitioners, Johnny was a \"denier\". Such children, it is believed, simply refuse to admit the true extent of the harm that they have caused. However hard a child protests the innocence of their actions, that they were just mucking around, it's not accepted. \"You expect people to deny at first,\" says Mark Dalton, team manager of the NSPCC's Midlands Project for Young People With Inappropriate Sexual Behaviour. \"Why would they admit? People deny the intent or seriousness of it, or aspects of the responsibility. They say he was leading me on. You only admit to get it over and done with. And it's not a question of simply going, 'It's a fair cop, Guv. I did it.' We want the emotion that goes with that.\" Projects have been established throughout Britain, by probation services, children's services and young-offender units, to enable young abusers to come to terms with what they have done, to have that \"emotion\". There are 18 NSPCC young-abuser projects throughout the country, with 12 more planned, \"to stop young abusers becoming the serial paedophiles in the future\". They provide sessions of individual or group therapy, over a period of three months to a year, designed to make the children \"address their abusive behaviour\", increase \"victim empathy\" (ie understand how hurtful it is to be abused by them) and motivate them to change, \"to replace anti-social thoughts and behaviour with more positive ones\". This is a new and burgeoning professional field. At a recent National Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers (NOTA) conference on Effective Research And Protective Practice, in York, there were more than 400 participants who work with sex offenders. Twelve workshops focused on young abusers, from Family Therapy with Incarcerated Young Sex Offenders to Focused Group Treatment for Sexually Acting Out Boys Aged 10-15 Years. The consensus among the participants was that \"sexually inappropriate behaviour\" generally begins between the ages of six and seven, and that it will have happened many times before it is detected, usually years later. The orthodoxy goes that, for each reported incident, there are scores more unreported. This is the model that would be applied to Johnny R. In this messy landscape of children's sexual development, measuring what is inappropriate is not a simple task. A recent referral to Dalton's Project For Young People With Inappropriate Sexual Behaviour is a seven-year-old who rubbed Smarties on his penis and fed them to a younger child. There is still no benchmark of \"appropriate\" behaviour against which such actions can be assessed. Health trust ethical committees are understandably reluctant for any research on children's sexual development to be carried out on their patch. Children's emerging sexuality remains an area of which we adults are simply ignorant. John Coleman, director of the Trust for the Study of Adolescents, says, \"What is normal? We don't know. We don't have the research to tell us. It's absurd how little concrete information we've got when it's so important and has so many implications. We don't know what is actually happening out there.\" Of course, there are indisputable cases of abuse. The Sex Offender Unit at Middlesex Probation Service has worked with gang rapists, abductors and stalkers, all in their early teens. Marcus Erooga, an NSPCC team manager and co-editor of the recently published Children And Young People Who Sexually Abuse Others: Challenges And Responses, argues that the area of what counts as abuse is not as fuzzy as it might seem. \"There's a very tight definition,\" he says. \"Inappropriate and non-consensual. It's quite explicit, deliberate, sexual acts.\" Our confusion arises from our refusal to take abuse by children seriously. What would count as clear abuse if perpetrated on a child by an adult is often not seen as such when the perpetrator is a child themselves. \"There's a myth that goes around that if a child has been abused by another child, it's not that bad,\" says Anne Blues, team manager of the NSPCC/Barnado's project Kaleidoscope, which specialises in treating very young children \"whose sexual behaviour harms others\". Kaleidoscope is \"pro-active\" in trying to get girl abusers, in particular, referred to them. \"Girls are defined as promiscuous when they're actually abusive,\" says Blues. \"And the boys won't tell you, because the overriding feeling is, 'Aren't they lucky'.\" But beyond obvious examples, there lies a hinterland of sexual activity where such certainties founder. Last March, Cheynes Infant School in Luton banned the playground game Kiss Chase because it involved \"unwanted physical attention\" and the \"exchange of bodily fluids\" (ie saliva). Headteacher Maureen Fitzgerald wrote a letter to parents explaining that she considered the game, with small children putting their tongues in each other's mouths, \"inappropriate behaviour\". Some believe that Doctors And Nurses will be next. Ann Furedi, columnist and director of communications at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, says that adults are unnecessarily proscribing childish actions. \"I believe children will explore their body, their genitals, and ask questions in an entirely unembarrassed and unawkward way, without really placing it in a sexual context. We then look at this through a particular prism. Increasingly, there's a tendency to interpret what would have been seen as quite innocent activities as being loaded with a sexual context.\" When is an act by a child sexual at all, rather than plain, old-fashioned bad behaviour? Marcus Erooga insists that, even if the child doesn't understand the notion of sexual and gets no sexual gratification from their actions, it should still be seen as sexual abuse. \"The reason that it's important that the word sexual remains there, whatever the motivation, is because the behaviour still has a sexual component and is likely to continue to effect their sexual development if not addressed,\" he says. In one recent case, an 11-year-old boy was convicted of assaulting a two-year-old relative. Her mother had called the police when she found him lying naked with her daughter. Although the boy pleaded guilty, a doctor's report was accepted by the judge that concluded he suffered from Attention Deficit Disorder and there was \"no clear evidence that sexual motivation was a part of this incident\". Nevertheless, the 11-year-old was placed on the Sex Offenders Register for 30 months. Increasingly, younger and younger children are being defined as sexual abusers. Anne Blues's youngest client was three years old. \"She was excluded from nursery for masturbating and for using implements on other children - pencils and things. She obviously didn't understand what she was doing, but she was doing things to other children and they did not want her to. It's important not to label children, but we have to describe the behaviour.\" But, unlike other childish crimes - pick-pocketing, shoplifting, joyriding - the argument is not simply whether the young person did it or not. The argument is whether what they did actually caused harm and was morally wrong. Once, God and Mother provided signposts through this murky emotional landscape. That job is being increasingly handed over to the young abuser professionals who decide what is acceptable and what is not. There's an understandable desire among these experts to get to grips with the grey area of nascent sexual development. They want to draw up some harder and faster rules. Attempts to codify \"appropriate sexual behaviour\" in children began in the US where, just 15 years ago, there was no such thing as a treatment programme for sexually-abusive kids. By 1996, there were 50 residential and 396 non-residential programmes for sex offenders under the age of 12. These centres needed clear-cut categories applied to the emotional mess of children's emerging sexuality. A plethora of handbooks were published, advising parents, teachers, health-care workers and children themselves what was \"appropriate sexual behaviour\". The most popular was Flirting Or Hurting?, first published in 1994 and selling more than 20,000 copies. This book charts the differences between flirting and harassment. Flirting, it suggests, includes comments such as, \"Like your hair\" and \"You look nice\". Harassment might be lip-licking and the very same phrase that might, with another tone of voice or facial expression, be appropriate: \"You look nice.\" But even in a society that believes it is having some success in codifying \"normal\" sexual behaviour, there is furious debate. In the autumn of 1996 in Lexington, North Carolina, first-grader Johnathan Prevette was punished for giving a classmate a peck on the cheek. The boy's defence - that the girl had asked for a kiss - was not accepted. His punishment included being forced to miss an ice-cream party for children with good attendance records. The six-year-old Prevette became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, and members of his family were invited on to TV chatshows as honoured guests. Jane Martin, a spokesperson for the school district, declared, \"A six-year-old kissing another six-year-old is inappropriate behaviour. Unwelcome is unwelcome at any age.\" She went on to point out that the rules on sexual harassment were clearly set out in a handbook. Few adults share this clear-cut sense of boundaries beyond which a child must not tread. The recent collapse of a case against 11-year-old Swiss boy Raoul Wuthrich, accused by a neighbour in Colorado of touching his five-year-old sister \"in an inappropriate way\" while helping her pee in the garden, demonstrates how difficult it is to set clear guidelines. Yet, whatever the uncertainties, it inevitably and rightly falls on us adults to guide and police children's sexual development. According to former teacher Neil Duncan, senior lecturer in education at the University of Wolverhampton and author of Sexual Bullying, we are seeing a teenage world through the prism of adult eyes: \"Staff have come to me to report 'disgusting' things they've heard about bodily fluids [semen] - the last taboo. You go along and speak to the kids, who say it was 'just a laugh'. That's all it meant. We're so uptight about the sexual behaviour of children that any contact can be reconstituted in terms of peer child abuse.\" Once the decision is reached that an act of abuse has occurred, the child is then judged a deviant. The NSPCC believes that he or she may well be an adult sex offender in the making. \"Paedophiles don't wake up at 23,\" they argue. \"We know adult paedophiles start fantasising sexual interest in children as adolescents.\" But not all young abuser professionals believe that there is an inevitable slippery slope from teenage groping to adult offending. \"The received wisdom 10 years ago was that if you didn't help people stop, they would never stop, and that juvenile abusers were just adult abusers in training. But that just doesn't stand up,\" says Mark Dalton. \"The most usual experience we get is a young teenage boy who is in a caring role with a child he knows and it's a grope, it's a fondle, it's that sort of thing. We can't say that that 15-year-old is going to become the next Fred West.\" Alison Hadley, national policy officer at Brooks Advisory Service, makes a plea for adult tolerance of our adolescents. \"We have to remember that they're children, and are needing guidance and support. People forget that it's a steep learning curve in your teens, and you do make mistakes.\" Mistakes can be costly for today's teenagers. One Monday morning in June, Pete K's mother received a phone call from his Catholic secondary school asking her to come and take her son back home. A girl, 14, had reported that, while she was sitting next to him in class the previous Wednesday, Pete, also 14, had taken hold of her hand and put it on his crotch. She then said that he had placed his hand on her leg and moved it towards her crotch. Pete admitted taking her hand, but denied placing his hand on her leg. This was said to have happened during a French lesson, with 28 other children and a teacher present. The girl's father reported the incident and Mrs K was asked to take her son down to the police station, where he was arrested for indecent assault and cautioned. \"Fair enough, he did act inappropriately,\" she says. \"He signed the caution, and then out came the Sex Offenders Register.\" Even those who have simply accepted a caution are required to be registered for two-and-a-half years. The police did not make the K family or their solicitor aware of this requirement before they accepted the caution. \"When we were asked to sign the register, we refused,\" says Mrs K. \"First, they were going to arrest me for not compelling him to sign. Then him, for not signing.\" Two weeks later, Pete was permanently excluded from school, just over a year before he was due to sit his GCSEs. His younger sister was sent away to live with her father, out of the district, as a condition of him returning home. He was allowed supervised visits to see her once a week. \"To me as a normal person, he's done nothing different from what millions of teenagers do,\" says Mrs K. \"That's why I wouldn't sign it. If they put all these adolescents on the register, it will be a very big one. They want to put children by the side of paedophiles. There's something wrong.\" Johnny R's appeal date was set in early November, three months after his conviction. There were no wigs, few formalities, and the grey-haired judge leaned over his bench and said, \"If Johnny wants to break off to go to the loo or to stretch his legs, just let me know.\" But courtrooms are not child-friendly, and the ceiling, as high as a church, made Johnny, in a blue fleece jacket and jogging pants, seem even smaller. His mouth was still hanging open a little, perhaps wondering what this was all about. The R family were all dressed ferociously neatly, with oiled-back hair and fiercely ironed suits, as if the slightest crease would somehow make them crumble. Only a courtroom away, a woman was being convicted for murdering her children. The tape of the initial police interview with Nicky S was played. The woman police officer was very gentle with her, constantly reassuring, \"You're doing very well,\" and muttering a soft, \"Okay, Okay.\" (In contrast, when Johnny started crying, he was told sharply by the same police officer, \"I don't want you snivelling all through the interview.\") \"He's very fond of me, he does love me, but I don't love him,\" Nicky told the kind police lady. As this declaration played in court, the prosecuting solicitor took a pen out of her Winnie the Pooh pencil case. In this strange arena, what counted as childish and adult seemed to have become confused. When we watched the tape of Johnny's best friend, Eric, trying to describe what went on, he said Johnny \"fancied her . . . they've been dating each other\". His words trespassed into dangerous territory. To the grown-ups, they sounded far too adult for his age. Eric was nine. Nicky, a tiny Nike fashion plate, was cross-examined by video link. At one point, she buried her head entirely inside her T-shirt, so all we could see on the screen was a giant Nike tick. She began to cry, \"It's not my fault I can't remember things when I was little.\" Six months, when she was eight-and-three-quarters rather than nine, is an age ago for a small child. There were moments when the moral nature of this trial was all too clear. The police interrogated Johnny for a second time: \"What's a snog?\" asked the officer. \"I didn't ask her,\" whimpers Johnny. \"You didn't ask her for a snog?\" \"No.\" \"You don't know what that word means? Does it mean kiss?\" \"Yes.\" \"But you didn't ask her for a snog?\" \"No.\" And I can't help thinking, so what if he did. It's not a crime - and surely not \"inappropriate sexual behaviour\" - for a 10-year-old to ask a girl he works with in maths group for a snog. Ask for a snog, not force one on her. The prosecuting barrister pursued the suggestion that Johnny \"fancied\" Nicky, imputing adult desires and intentions to these young children. He questioned Johnny: \"You like Nicky very much, don't you?\" (Yes) \"You thought she was nice?\" (Yes). \"Did you love her?\" (No) \"You wanted to be her boyfriend?\" (No). It was as if this, this fumbling for adolescence, had itself become a crime. My impression was that all the children were terrified of all the adults - whether the softly-spoken police woman in the interview room, the barking barristers, or even their own families. All the little interviewees seemed to be desperately trying to give answers that wouldn't get them in trouble. They knew they'd done something that grown-ups didn't like. The words used by the adults in court to describe the children's genitals was \"rude bits\", and their alleged actions were \"messing with\" and \"naughty\". The message was clear: whatever these children were doing, if anything at all, the grown-ups thought it was dirty. But the grey-haired judge decided otherwise. It took him less than four minutes to decide: \"They had all played together on numerous occasions, and on some of these occasions there had been horseplay,\" he said. \"Are we sure the conduct was indecent? We've come to the conclusion that we cannot be sure.\" The case against the 10-year-old was overturned. Johnny R won his appeal. He's started going to a new school, making new friends to play football with. He's just had his 11th birthday party. He got his Sega Dreamcast.",

      "bodyText": "In clubs, men have a very formal dance that involves getting another beer and slumping in their chair. Eventually, he'll get up and dance with/ obstruct/tackle the woman of his choice. This movement is designed to get women off the dancefloor quickly, to somewhere where the man is not quite so vulnerable. Some women get up on the floor and dance alone with their arms above their heads. On no account try to dance with them, as they are obviously doing something intensely sensuous and won't want you suddenly grabbing them and spinning them. Rave dancing is pretty straightforward: you just take a little pill and the music tells you what to do. When you've finished dancing, you realise that you've been doing exactly the same movement for three hours, you're two stone lighter and you've forgotten where you live. At weddings and family parties, all generations can display their dancing skills. You can put on the Sex Pistols, and the over- 60s will immediately start a nice little quick-step that they perfected during the Blitz. Then, all parents who were alive in the 60s will re-create some of the groovy moves with which they attempted to cash in on free love. These get the same kind of response that they did back then. Most people who are forced on to the floor opt for the traditional shuffling-haddock routine, in which you step gingerly from one foot to the other and look intently at the floor as if you've just dropped 2p. Sadly, the people who look most ridiculous on the dancefloor are those people who really enjoy dancing and are just full of an insane urge to move their body to Gloria Gaynor.

      "body": "<p>Steaming was introduced to many post-war families via the pressure cooker. One of us remembers well the occasion when his mother chose to use the treasured new cooker to make some spinach: unfortunately, the jiggling weight on the pan's lid that controls the steam pressure came adrift and the spinach was expelled as a high-velocity green jet. With her kitchen ceiling festooned with stalactites of spinach, mother never repeated the experiment and from then on only boiled spinach was served.</p> <p>This was a pity. Steaming - whether under pressure or not - is an excellent way of cooking, especially vegetables. This is because it preserves texture that is more easily lost when the vegetables are boiled. (Steaming is also claimed to preserve water-soluble nutrients that are lost by boiling, but this is largely a myth.) The principal advantage of steaming over boiling is that steaming is easier to control, because it is a less efficient way of transferring heat. This means that it takes longer, so that small errors in the timing make less difference to the final product.</p> <p>In the roster of cooking efficiency, steaming occupies a place midway between boiling in water and roasting in the dry air of a hot oven. It is more efficient than roasting in dry air for two reasons. First, the steam condenses to form liquid droplets when it contacts the comparatively cool food surface, dumping its load of heat in a burst in the process. This load of latent heat is enormous - as hot, in fact, as the plate needed to boil the water in the first place. Moist air can also carry around three times as much heat as the same volume of dry air, which explains in part why we cook some foods in a bain-marie (that is, in a shallow dish of water in a hot oven).</p> <p>The efficiency of the steaming can be increased by raising the temperature of the steam. Of course, the easiest way to do this is in a pressure cooker, where the higher pressures raise the boiling point of the water. The increased pressure itself doesn't make much difference to cooking efficiency - it is the increased temperature of the steam that does it. The uniformity of the cooking is also improved, since the steam is contained within a closed vessel that maintains a uniform temperature throughout.</p> <p>There is considerable scope for using the imagination when it comes to steaming. One is to arrange for a gradient of cooking efficiency. Chefs do just this when cooking asparagus, by standing the spears vertically in an open steamer, so that the tender tips - being further away from the surface of the boiling water - are in a cooler environment than the bases and hence cook more slowly.</p> <p>For the more adventurous cooks among us, there is also room to experiment with steaming over wine or other alcohol. Wine boils at around 97C, while stronger alcoholic drinks such as vodka have a boiling point of around 90C, so both should give longer cooking times and enhanced flavours. One tip: keep the lid on, and preferably cooled with a moistened cloth. That way, you won't set fire to your kitchen (alcohol vapour is inflammable). Equally importantly, you won't waste the alcohol by cooking this way: it will condense on the inside of the cooled lid and run back down. So, if the food doesn't work out, you can always drink the juice.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> Potato pancakes</b><br> I love these simple names for brilliant and delicious foods. This recipe, in fact, uses two cooking methods, because once you've steamed the potatoes to go into the mix, you need to fry the resultant batter to make the pancakes <br></p> <p>450g good mashing potato<br> 3 whole eggs and 2 egg whites <br> 3 heaped tbsp self-raising flour <br> 150ml milk <br> 150ml double cream <br> 1 tsp freshly-grated nutmeg <br> Sea salt <br> Black pepper</p> <p>Peel and eye the potatoes. Cut them into small pieces and rinse under cold water. Set them in a steamer over furiously boiling water, and leave until cooked through. Once done, mash the potatoes until quite smooth, then set aside to cool. Place the mash in a food processor, add all the other ingredients and whizz until you have smooth, silky, and quite thick batter. Cover, and refrigerate for at least an hour. Cook the batter as you would pancakes - portion size depends on the size of pan you use, and whether you'd rather make individual pancakes or just a single large communal one. Serve with goodies such as smoked eel, crispy bacon, horseradish cream, chives, whatever takes your fancy.</p> <p><b> Steamed scallops in the shell</b><br> A gorgeous Cantonese recipe, simple and elegant, from Yan-Kit So. <br></p> <p>20 large scallops <br> Groundnut oil for frying<br> 6-8 cloves garlic, peeled and diced <br> 6 large spring onions, green parts only, cut into rounds</p> <p>For the sauce</p> <p>6 large spring onions, white parts only, cut into very fine threads <br> 60ml groundnut oil <br> 2cm fresh ginger root, peeled and cut into very fine threads <br> 3 fresh green chillies, seeded and cut into rounds <br> 30ml thick soy sauce <br> 30ml thin soy sauce<br> 30ml water <br></p> <p>Ask the fishmonger to open the scallops on the cup side of the shells, rather than on the flat side. Remove the frills, black impurities, muscles and corals (use these latter in a soup, say), leaving only the white meat. Rinse the meat and pat dry, leaving it on the shells.</p> <p>Prepare the sauce. Divide the spring onions into two serving bowls. Heat a wok until smoky, add the oil and swirl it around, lower the heat, then add the ginger and chilli. Remove from the heat. After a few seconds, add the soy sauces and water, bring to a simmer, then pour over the onion in the two bowls.</p> <p>Fill a wok or deep fryer with enough oil to cover the base of a small wire sieve in which you will cook the garlic, and heat to 180C. Put the garlic into the sieve, and dip briefly into the hot oil three or four times, until it has taken on colour. Sprinkle the fried garlic and the same amount of green spring onion over each scallop, then place the scallops in a steamer. Cook over boiling water for seven to 10 minutes, until the meat has turned opaque. Remove the shells from the steamer with care, as you do not want to spill the juice. Serve at once, with the sauce bowls alongside: the idea is to pour a little over each scallop, then fork up lightly so the shellfish absorbs the liquor - and don't forget to drink the juice in the shells, too.</p> <p><b> Steak and kidney pudding </b><br> A great dish to relieve the ennui of the long winter months. <br></p> <p>For the filling 1 kg rump steak<br> 250g veal kidneys <br> 250g button mushrooms <br> Vegetable oil, for frying <br> 1 glass red wine <br> 2 medium onions, finely chopped <br> 1 bayleaf <br> 1 sprig thyme <br> 290ml red wine <br> 290ml water <br> Sea salt and black pepper</p> <p>For the suet crust</p> <p>250g self-raising flour<br> 75g suet <br> 50g unsalted butter<br> Zest of 1 lemon, finely grated <br> Salt and pepper <br> Water to mix</p> <p>First make the braise - it will be all the better for being made the day before. Trim the excess fat from the beef, and cut the meat into 2.5cm cubes. Remove the fat and veins from the kidneys, cut them in half, then into slices, though not too thin. Wipe the mushrooms with a damp cloth.</p> <p>Liberally season the meat, then fry it in batches in a wide, heavy-bottomed, cast-iron pan, until brown and crusted all over. Put the cooked meat in a colander over a bowl, to collect the juices. Repeat until all the meat is browned. Pour the wine into the hot pan, scrape up any residue adhering to the base with a wooden spoon, pour into a bowl and reserve.</p> <p>In a large braising pot, first brown the onions in a little oil, then add the mushrooms and allow to colour lightly. Add the meat, the liquid from both the draining bowl and the pan, the herbs and the seasonings. Pour in the wine and water, bring to a gentle simmer, then bake in a preheated oven (16OC/ 325F/gas mark 3) for two hours.</p> <p>Lightly butter a 1.5-litre pudding bowl and lay a small circle of greaseproof paper on the bottom of the mould. Put a big pan of water on to simmer, ready to receive the pudding bowl. Now you're ready to make the suet crust. Sift the flour into a bowl, along with the seasoning, add the suet and lemon zest, and mix. Add a few tablespoons of cold water to make a soft dough, wrap well in cling-film, and refrigerate for half an hour. Cut the dough into two pieces, one smaller than the other. Roll out the larger piece so that it will line the pudding bowl, and the smaller one to act as the lid. Tip the steak and kidney into the crust, and pop on the lid.</p> <p>Seal the bowl with foil - absolutely no steam or liquid must come into contact with the crust. Place the package in the pan of water, cover and leave to simmer for an hour-and-a-half. Serve straight from the bowl.</p> <p><b> The steaming of vegetables </b><br> Not so much a recipe as a guide -reading Joy Larkcom's words on the subject is a real treat, so I put them down here, not least because they're so good.</p> <p>Steaming is a fast, efficient method of cooking vegetables. It preserves their delicate flavour, conserving more nutrients than when boiled. It is suitable for all leafy vegetables, and for root vegetables and beans, which should be sliced finely if they are large. Vegetables with a high moisture content, such as cucumber, are not generally very suited to steaming.</p> <p>If available, use a metal steamer or a Chinese bamboo steamer, which can be set into a wok. Or improvise with a wire sieve on top of a saucepan, covered with some sort of lid or cooking foil.</p> <p>Method</p> <p>A) Boil the water. Put the vegetables into the upper part of the steamer, making sure they don't touch the water but are permeated by the steam. <br> B) Cover and steam for a few minutes. <br> C) Test for readiness by breaking off a little piece of the vegetable and tasting. <br> D) Season after steaming with salt, pepper, lemon, fresh herbs etc (lemon and salt help to bring out other flavours). Fresh herbs tossed through freshly steamed vegetables are very good. Try it with chervil, Chinese chives, basil, mint or any fresh herbs to hand. Serve with sliced raw radishes on top, allowing them just to absorb the warmth of the vegetables</p>",

In the roster of cooking efficiency, steaming occupies a place midway between boiling in water and roasting in the dry air of a hot oven. It is more efficient than roasting in dry air for two reasons. First, the steam condenses to form liquid droplets when it contacts the comparatively cool food surface, dumping its load of heat in a burst in the process. This load of latent heat is enormous - as hot, in fact, as the plate needed to boil the water in the first place. Moist air can also carry around three times as much heat as the same volume of dry air, which explains in part why we cook some foods in a bain-marie (that is, in a shallow dish of water in a hot oven). The efficiency of the steaming can be increased by raising the temperature of the steam. Of course, the easiest way to do this is in a pressure cooker, where the higher pressures raise the boiling point of the water. The increased pressure itself doesn't make much difference to cooking efficiency - it is the increased temperature of the steam that does it. The uniformity of the cooking is also improved, since the steam is contained within a closed vessel that maintains a uniform temperature throughout. There is considerable scope for using the imagination when it comes to steaming. One is to arrange for a gradient of cooking efficiency. Chefs do just this when cooking asparagus, by standing the spears vertically in an open steamer, so that the tender tips - being further away from the surface of the boiling water - are in a cooler environment than the bases and hence cook more slowly. For the more adventurous cooks among us, there is also room to experiment with steaming over wine or other alcohol. Wine boils at around 97C, while stronger alcoholic drinks such as vodka have a boiling point of around 90C, so both should give longer cooking times and enhanced flavours. One tip: keep the lid on, and preferably cooled with a moistened cloth. That way, you won't set fire to your kitchen (alcohol vapour is inflammable). Equally importantly, you won't waste the alcohol by cooking this way: it will condense on the inside of the cooled lid and run back down. So, if the food doesn't work out, you can always drink the juice. All recipes serve six. Potato pancakes I love these simple names for brilliant and delicious foods. This recipe, in fact, uses two cooking methods, because once you've steamed the potatoes to go into the mix, you need to fry the resultant batter to make the pancakes 450g good mashing potato 3 whole eggs and 2 egg whites 3 heaped tbsp self-raising flour 150ml milk 150ml double cream 1 tsp freshly-grated nutmeg Sea salt Black pepper Peel and eye the potatoes. Cut them into small pieces and rinse under cold water. Set them in a steamer over furiously boiling water, and leave until cooked through. Once done, mash the potatoes until quite smooth, then set aside to cool. Place the mash in a food processor, add all the other ingredients and whizz until you have smooth, silky, and quite thick batter. Cover, and refrigerate for at least an hour. Cook the batter as you would pancakes - portion size depends on the size of pan you use, and whether you'd rather make individual pancakes or just a single large communal one. Serve with goodies such as smoked eel, crispy bacon, horseradish cream, chives, whatever takes your fancy. Steamed scallops in the shell A gorgeous Cantonese recipe, simple and elegant, from Yan-Kit So. 20 large scallops Groundnut oil for frying 6-8 cloves garlic, peeled and diced 6 large spring onions, green parts only, cut into rounds For the sauce 6 large spring onions, white parts only, cut into very fine threads 60ml groundnut oil 2cm fresh ginger root, peeled and cut into very fine threads 3 fresh green chillies, seeded and cut into rounds 30ml thick soy sauce 30ml thin soy sauce 30ml water Ask the fishmonger to open the scallops on the cup side of the shells, rather than on the flat side. Remove the frills, black impurities, muscles and corals (use these latter in a soup, say), leaving only the white meat. Rinse the meat and pat dry, leaving it on the shells. Prepare the sauce. Divide the spring onions into two serving bowls. Heat a wok until smoky, add the oil and swirl it around, lower the heat, then add the ginger and chilli. Remove from the heat. After a few seconds, add the soy sauces and water, bring to a simmer, then pour over the onion in the two bowls. Fill a wok or deep fryer with enough oil to cover the base of a small wire sieve in which you will cook the garlic, and heat to 180C. Put the garlic into the sieve, and dip briefly into the hot oil three or four times, until it has taken on colour. Sprinkle the fried garlic and the same amount of green spring onion over each scallop, then place the scallops in a steamer. Cook over boiling water for seven to 10 minutes, until the meat has turned opaque. Remove the shells from the steamer with care, as you do not want to spill the juice. Serve at once, with the sauce bowls alongside: the idea is to pour a little over each scallop, then fork up lightly so the shellfish absorbs the liquor - and don't forget to drink the juice in the shells, too. Steak and kidney pudding A great dish to relieve the ennui of the long winter months. For the filling 1 kg rump steak 250g veal kidneys 250g button mushrooms Vegetable oil, for frying 1 glass red wine 2 medium onions, finely chopped 1 bayleaf 1 sprig thyme 290ml red wine 290ml water Sea salt and black pepper For the suet crust 250g self-raising flour 75g suet 50g unsalted butter Zest of 1 lemon, finely grated Salt and pepper Water to mix First make the braise - it will be all the better for being made the day before. Trim the excess fat from the beef, and cut the meat into 2.5cm cubes. Remove the fat and veins from the kidneys, cut them in half, then into slices, though not too thin. Wipe the mushrooms with a damp cloth. Liberally season the meat, then fry it in batches in a wide, heavy-bottomed, cast-iron pan, until brown and crusted all over. Put the cooked meat in a colander over a bowl, to collect the juices. Repeat until all the meat is browned. Pour the wine into the hot pan, scrape up any residue adhering to the base with a wooden spoon, pour into a bowl and reserve. In a large braising pot, first brown the onions in a little oil, then add the mushrooms and allow to colour lightly. Add the meat, the liquid from both the draining bowl and the pan, the herbs and the seasonings. Pour in the wine and water, bring to a gentle simmer, then bake in a preheated oven (16OC/ 325F/gas mark 3) for two hours. Lightly butter a 1.5-litre pudding bowl and lay a small circle of greaseproof paper on the bottom of the mould. Put a big pan of water on to simmer, ready to receive the pudding bowl. Now you're ready to make the suet crust. Sift the flour into a bowl, along with the seasoning, add the suet and lemon zest, and mix. Add a few tablespoons of cold water to make a soft dough, wrap well in cling-film, and refrigerate for half an hour. Cut the dough into two pieces, one smaller than the other. Roll out the larger piece so that it will line the pudding bowl, and the smaller one to act as the lid. Tip the steak and kidney into the crust, and pop on the lid. Seal the bowl with foil - absolutely no steam or liquid must come into contact with the crust. Place the package in the pan of water, cover and leave to simmer for an hour-and-a-half. Serve straight from the bowl. The steaming of vegetables Not so much a recipe as a guide -reading Joy Larkcom's words on the subject is a real treat, so I put them down here, not least because they're so good. Steaming is a fast, efficient method of cooking vegetables. It preserves their delicate flavour, conserving more nutrients than when boiled. It is suitable for all leafy vegetables, and for root vegetables and beans, which should be sliced finely if they are large. Vegetables with a high moisture content, such as cucumber, are not generally very suited to steaming. If available, use a metal steamer or a Chinese bamboo steamer, which can be set into a wok. Or improvise with a wire sieve on top of a saucepan, covered with some sort of lid or cooking foil. Method A) Boil the water. Put the vegetables into the upper part of the steamer, making sure they don't touch the water but are permeated by the steam. B) Cover and steam for a few minutes. C) Test for readiness by breaking off a little piece of the vegetable and tasting. D) Season after steaming with salt, pepper, lemon, fresh herbs etc (lemon and salt help to bring out other flavours). Fresh herbs tossed through freshly steamed vegetables are very good. Try it with chervil, Chinese chives, basil, mint or any fresh herbs to hand. Serve with sliced raw radishes on top, allowing them just to absorb the warmth of the vegetables",

As I recall, it doesn't even have windows, but that's possibly because I was too dazzled by his \"skyscraper lights\" to notice.

Designers in this field would take one look at Dossett's studio and recommend a bit of \"task lighting\" or wall washing (among other techniques beyond the scope of an average 60-watt bulb).

      "body": "<p>L'Opportun doesn't immediately catch the eye. It's a bit scruffy and, to be honest, small - just a couple of back rooms seating maybe 20 people. But there's a queue at the bar awaiting tables, and another queue that reaches out of the door and on to the boulevard Edgar Quinet. It makes you think, hey ho, there must be something a bit special going on here. And so there is. My friend, Jean-Pierre, tells me that L'Opportun is the hottest table in Paris at the moment, and Jean-Pierre knows, because he decides which is the hottest table in Paris at any given moment. That's his job, or one of them at any rate.</p> <p>The Parisien gourmet bon ton , on the other hand, are not queuing up at L'Opportun looking for the rarified heights of creative cookery, for palatal pyrotechnics and for plate poetry. All that, according to Jean-Pierre, is a thing of the past. Oh, all right, Alain Ducasse, Pierre Gagnaire and Guy Savoy still weave their magic, but the great mass movement of the culinary arts has moved on, or rather, back - back to the plain, the hale, the hearty and the unashamedly provincial.</p> <p>Here are a few items off the ordonnance du jour (the chef/prop of L'Opportun and self-styled Beaujoloth\u00e9rapeute, Serge Alzerat, a man who bears the unmistakeable mark of his own cooking, is rather given to jokes along the lines of \"Centre de Beaujoloth\u00e9rapie - D\u00e9pistage de la P\u00e9pie, Prophylaxie de la Soif\"): la salade de groin d' \u00e2ne (\u00e2ne is donkey, to save you reaching for a dictionary), la t\u00eate de veau fa\u00e7on gribiche, la fricasse d'escargots et pleurotes, and le coq au vin du beaujolais. All these bear the hallmarks of a return to the regional roots of French cooking, earthy in both the sense that it is of a specific terroir - Lyons, in this case - and in its gastronomic characteristics.</p> <p>Such culinary simplicity depends for its impact of the quality of the raw materials, and this is the mast to which Alzerat has pinned his colours. The beef, declares the menu, comes from Pierrefort in the Cantal. Jean-Pierre Dutr\u00e9vis, \"artisan boucher\", selects the animals and prepares the meat. The cheeses are brought to perfect maturity by affineur Herv\u00e9 Mons. These are not the gestures of your average beaten-up bistrot.</p> <p>The value of such careful sourcing was immediately evident in the dinner through which Jean-Pierre, his wife Albertine, Jean-Claude and I worked our way: a plate of foie gras, plain on the plate, but for a few squares of meat jelly; oeufs cocotte aux truffes (eggs baked in cream with truffles); a plate of kidneys and sweetbreads for Albertine and myself, and a fillet steak the size of a small tree trunk with a kind of cheesy sauce for J-P and J-C; a plate of cheeses and a slab of fondant chocolate for me, and a tarte tatin for Albertine. The foie gras was good, the baked eggs outstanding, the kidneys and sweetbreads excellent, the steak fabulous (and the curious, creamy-cheesy sauce very good); the cheeses the finest I have eaten in France; and the fondant chocolate the definition of Keats's suggestion about \"ceasing upon the midnight with no pain\". (I have no idea what the tarte tatin tasted like, because by that time I was past it.)</p> <p>You could cavil that the vegetables weren't sourced with the same degree of fanaticism as the other elements (but then, L'Opportun doesn't seem to cater for vegetarians in any sense of the word), and they get fairly cavalier treatment on the menu, with the exception of some splendid pommes de terre lyonnaises. But when you're paying Ff95 (around \u00a39) for top-dog foie gras, Ff90 for the baked eggs and truffles, Ff1,330 for all our food, two bottles of old-fashioned light Gamay, two bottles of Beaune Marconnets 1994 and sundry other odds and ends (J-P picked up the tab, as is his generous wont), to nit-pick over vegetables seems pretty small-minded. I cannot think of a restaurant in this country that serves such stupendous food at such unstupendous prices</p>",

      "bodyText": "L'Opportun doesn't immediately catch the eye. It's a bit scruffy and, to be honest, small - just a couple of back rooms seating maybe 20 people. But there's a queue at the bar awaiting tables, and another queue that reaches out of the door and on to the boulevard Edgar Quinet. It makes you think, hey ho, there must be something a bit special going on here. And so there is. My friend, Jean-Pierre, tells me that L'Opportun is the hottest table in Paris at the moment, and Jean-Pierre knows, because he decides which is the hottest table in Paris at any given moment. That's his job, or one of them at any rate. The Parisien gourmet bon ton , on the other hand, are not queuing up at L'Opportun looking for the rarified heights of creative cookery, for palatal pyrotechnics and for plate poetry. All that, according to Jean-Pierre, is a thing of the past. Oh, all right, Alain Ducasse, Pierre Gagnaire and Guy Savoy still weave their magic, but the great mass movement of the culinary arts has moved on, or rather, back - back to the plain, the hale, the hearty and the unashamedly provincial. Here are a few items off the ordonnance du jour (the chef/prop of L'Opportun and self-styled Beaujoloth\u00e9rapeute, Serge Alzerat, a man who bears the unmistakeable mark of his own cooking, is rather given to jokes along the lines of \"Centre de Beaujoloth\u00e9rapie - D\u00e9pistage de la P\u00e9pie, Prophylaxie de la Soif\"): la salade de groin d' \u00e2ne (\u00e2ne is donkey, to save you reaching for a dictionary), la t\u00eate de veau fa\u00e7on gribiche, la fricasse d'escargots et pleurotes, and le coq au vin du beaujolais. All these bear the hallmarks of a return to the regional roots of French cooking, earthy in both the sense that it is of a specific terroir - Lyons, in this case - and in its gastronomic characteristics. Such culinary simplicity depends for its impact of the quality of the raw materials, and this is the mast to which Alzerat has pinned his colours. The beef, declares the menu, comes from Pierrefort in the Cantal. Jean-Pierre Dutr\u00e9vis, \"artisan boucher\", selects the animals and prepares the meat. The cheeses are brought to perfect maturity by affineur Herv\u00e9 Mons. These are not the gestures of your average beaten-up bistrot. The value of such careful sourcing was immediately evident in the dinner through which Jean-Pierre, his wife Albertine, Jean-Claude and I worked our way: a plate of foie gras, plain on the plate, but for a few squares of meat jelly; oeufs cocotte aux truffes (eggs baked in cream with truffles); a plate of kidneys and sweetbreads for Albertine and myself, and a fillet steak the size of a small tree trunk with a kind of cheesy sauce for J-P and J-C; a plate of cheeses and a slab of fondant chocolate for me, and a tarte tatin for Albertine. The foie gras was good, the baked eggs outstanding, the kidneys and sweetbreads excellent, the steak fabulous (and the curious, creamy-cheesy sauce very good); the cheeses the finest I have eaten in France; and the fondant chocolate the definition of Keats's suggestion about \"ceasing upon the midnight with no pain\". (I have no idea what the tarte tatin tasted like, because by that time I was past it.) You could cavil that the vegetables weren't sourced with the same degree of fanaticism as the other elements (but then, L'Opportun doesn't seem to cater for vegetarians in any sense of the word), and they get fairly cavalier treatment on the menu, with the exception of some splendid pommes de terre lyonnaises. But when you're paying Ff95 (around \u00a39) for top-dog foie gras, Ff90 for the baked eggs and truffles, Ff1,330 for all our food, two bottles of old-fashioned light Gamay, two bottles of Beaune Marconnets 1994 and sundry other odds and ends (J-P picked up the tab, as is his generous wont), to nit-pick over vegetables seems pretty small-minded. I cannot think of a restaurant in this country that serves such stupendous food at such unstupendous prices",

Like Robert Thompson and Jon Venables in the James Bulger murder trial in 1993, these boys were subjected to the rigours of a legal procedure that was lost on them. \"I thought the whole thing was entirely inappropriate,\" says Robin Grey QC, who defended one of the boys. \"It was a bit farcical that you had children and the spectacle of a three-week trial.

While European tea lovers have always rated top Ceylon estates highly, here the 60s Ceylon Tea centres - which served up a cup of heartburn-inducing tannic brew alongside some vaguely curried veg in cold pastry - did nothing to endear it to consumers. During the same period, UK tea brokers deserted Sri Lanka as the industry was nationalised, quality took a nosedive and the colonial planters either headed for home or for Kenya. To cap all that, the island's extensive tea plantations were hit by an outbreak of worms that were resistant to pesticides: a frightening development, as a similar outbreak had wiped out Ceylon's coffee production in perpetuity. A one-off, low-tech solution was found: children were paid manually to pick off the worms from the leaves.</p> <p>This salutary demonstration of the limitations of pesticides, however, set Sri Lanka on a course that is now making the country's teas some of the most exciting in the world. Since the crisis, the national policy has been to use pesticides only in extremis , never preventatively, and to encourage beneficial insect species as a mechanism for predator control. In the past few years, as the government has introduced the partial re-privatisation of the tea plantations, some of the best estates have taken pesticide-avoidance to its logical conclusion and converted to organic. And not just any old organic: many have adopted the most rigorous and sophisticated type of organic production possible, the biodynamic method of the Austrian philosopher, Rudolf Steiner.</p> <p>Steiner advocated the use of natural \"preparations\" (of which more below) and a lunar calendar to plot the optimum time for all operations in the growing cycle. Like homeopathy, the Steiner approach was once widely mocked as cranky mumbo jumbo, but today - and although the science behind it is still not fully understood - it is increasingly accepted that his methods can achieve remarkable results.</p> <p>The application of these biodynamic methods to Sri Lanka's tea production would have passed me by were it not for the efforts of Robert Wilson, a retired Ceylon tea planter, who is now importing into the UK a fabulous portfolio of \"Ceylon\" Teas - both organic and conventional - from top estates such as Brunswick, St James and Mahagastotte. Wilson's teas are bought in the most desirable dry season, when they are, in Ceylon tea-speak, at their most \"flavoury\".</p> <p>One of the most exceptional comes from the biodynamic Iddalgashinna Estate, which sits 6,500ft up in the Beragala Hills of Uva, and whose presence is announced at the lower levels with whitewashed road signs that declare the area a \"Toxic-Free Zone\". Iddalgashinna's natural environment shares much with the virgin rainforest on which it borders - superficially, it looks like a beautiful green jumble. While many tea plantations consist of concentric lines of tea bushes, here they are interspersed with diverse trees and plants, which produce not only vital shade but also beneficial green manures that are then supplemented with worm compost.</p> <p>The only spray the tea bushes get is a Steiner-style \"preparation\". Fresh dung from a lactating cow is mixed with rock phosphate and crushed eggshell, then packed into shallow brick trenches, covered with sacking and left for 30 days. The resultant mixture is then turned with a fork and left for a further 30 days, before being mixed with water and sprayed on the tea bushes. It has proven a remarkably effective alternative to pesticides, and aids the production of teas of supreme quality.</p> <p>I worked my way through all of Iddalgashinna's tea grades. The tea, which is always hand-picked, is manufactured in the traditional, skilled, \"orthodox\" manner. Among the stars on parade was a green orange pekoe that would cause a stampede of Japan's most devoted tea collectors - its large leaf unfurls beautifully on infusion, producing a pale-green liquor with an ultra-fresh, cut-grass bouquet and distinct peatiness - while even the most committed, first-flush Darjeeling lover would be left weak-kneed by \"silvery tips\", the newest growth, which produces a light, subtly smoky liquor. The other large-leaf black grades on offer are amazing, too, with pleasant bitterness and a nose of freshly-peeled oranges, caramel and cut flowers.</p> <p>And yet Iddalgashinna is not some inconsequential little tea garden. This \"bio-tea\" estate has a workforce of 1,400 and production to match. It is currently owned by a local company, has its own nursery school, house-building schemes and no less than three medical centres. This kind of infrastructure is standard in the traditional plantation system, but here the ethos is more egalitarian. On most estates, the workers stay respectfully outside the manager's office window. At Iddalgashinna, they are inside, working out the plantation's transition to community ownership.</p> <p>Many of Wilson's other Ceylon teas have an equally fascinating pedigree, and the sheer selection is paradise for anyone who likes to explore the intriguing nuances of a fine specialist product. Like malt whiskies, each estate has a unique style, as does each district, from the pungent, almost astringent Nuwara Eliyas to the more mellow Dimbulas or the delicate Uvas. Just one word of warning, however: dip your nose into these amazing teas and expect to get hooked \u0095</p> <p>Robert Wilson's Ceylon Teas, 01460 77508.</p>",

While many tea plantations consist of concentric lines of tea bushes, here they are interspersed with diverse trees and plants, which produce not only vital shade but also beneficial green manures that are then supplemented with worm compost. The only spray the tea bushes get is a Steiner-style \"preparation\". Fresh dung from a lactating cow is mixed with rock phosphate and crushed eggshell, then packed into shallow brick trenches, covered with sacking and left for 30 days. The resultant mixture is then turned with a fork and left for a further 30 days, before being mixed with water and sprayed on the tea bushes. It has proven a remarkably effective alternative to pesticides, and aids the production of teas of supreme quality. I worked my way through all of Iddalgashinna's tea grades. The tea, which is always hand-picked, is manufactured in the traditional, skilled, \"orthodox\" manner. Among the stars on parade was a green orange pekoe that would cause a stampede of Japan's most devoted tea collectors - its large leaf unfurls beautifully on infusion, producing a pale-green liquor with an ultra-fresh, cut-grass bouquet and distinct peatiness - while even the most committed, first-flush Darjeeling lover would be left weak-kneed by \"silvery tips\", the newest growth, which produces a light, subtly smoky liquor. The other large-leaf black grades on offer are amazing, too, with pleasant bitterness and a nose of freshly-peeled oranges, caramel and cut flowers. And yet Iddalgashinna is not some inconsequential little tea garden. This \"bio-tea\" estate has a workforce of 1,400 and production to match. It is currently owned by a local company, has its own nursery school, house-building schemes and no less than three medical centres. This kind of infrastructure is standard in the traditional plantation system, but here the ethos is more egalitarian. On most estates, the workers stay respectfully outside the manager's office window. At Iddalgashinna, they are inside, working out the plantation's transition to community ownership. Many of Wilson's other Ceylon teas have an equally fascinating pedigree, and the sheer selection is paradise for anyone who likes to explore the intriguing nuances of a fine specialist product. Like malt whiskies, each estate has a unique style, as does each district, from the pungent, almost astringent Nuwara Eliyas to the more mellow Dimbulas or the delicate Uvas. Just one word of warning, however: dip your nose into these amazing teas and expect to get hooked \u0095 Robert Wilson's Ceylon Teas, 01460 77508.",

      "body": "<b>Pilot jailed for \u00a31m kidnap plot</b> <p>A pilot was jailed for two-and-a-half years yesterday after demanding a \u00a31m ransom for the son of Anwar Pervez, the multi-millionaire owner of the Bestway cash-and-carry group. </p> <p>At Reading crown court, Peter Shadwell, 29, at one time the youngest airline captain in the country, admitted blackmail - though the kidnap never took place because he had been double-crossed by his co-defendant, David James, a private detective, who was earlier acquitted of blackmail. </p> <p>Shadwell, of Alderley Edge in Cheshire, claimed that after his home and car were repossessed he had hatched the plot with James to kidnap Dawood Pervez, an Oxford student whose elder brother he had known at public school. Shadwell said he paid \u00a350,000 to James after the detective had called and falsely said he had kidnapped Dawood. </p> <p>Sentencing Shadwell, Judge Stanley Spence commented: \"You were abused by a thoroughly dishonest co-defendant into believing the kidnap had taken place.\" </p> <p>James was earlier acquitted on the judge's order. He had claimed he was paid by Shadwell to follow relatives of Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson and BA chief executive Bob Ayling, which Shadwell denied. Shadwell, who had been employed by a BA subsidiary on \u00a340,000, sent Mr Pervez letters demanding \u00a31m. He was picked up by police after collecting a planted briefcase of money. </p> <p>Peter Nightingale, defending, said Shadwell was gay and had lived in a \"false world\", finding it difficult to admit his true feelings and becoming a binge spender; despite his \u00a3100,000 debts, he had put down \u00a3500 on a \u00a375,000 Mercedes. </p> <p><b>Police seek email date conwoman</b></p> <p>Police are looking for an internet temptress who calls herself Kirsty and cons her dates out of money. </p> <p>Her latest victim, Jamie Darlington, 17, a computer worker from Waltham Abbey in Essex, had an email romance for a month before being persuaded to travel more than 250 miles for a date on New Year's Eve. </p> <p>When the two met in Southampton, where he had booked five nights at a hotel, \"Kirsty\" asked him for \u00a3105 for some party tickets she said she had bought them, then got out of their taxi. </p> <p>The teenager was still waiting in the taxi when he got a message on his mobile: \"You are the most gullible person in the world. Thanks for the money - it will come in handy... Ha ha ha.\" </p> <p>Police in Southampton think many other men have also been tricked but are embarrassed to come forward. </p> <p>The teenager said yesterday: \"We used to exchange regular emails. In the middle of one internet conversation, she asked me what I was doing on New Year's Eve. </p> <p>\"I said that I was thinking about going into work to earn some extra money.

      "bodyText": "Pilot jailed for \u00a31m kidnap plot A pilot was jailed for two-and-a-half years yesterday after demanding a \u00a31m ransom for the son of Anwar Pervez, the multi-millionaire owner of the Bestway cash-and-carry group. At Reading crown court, Peter Shadwell, 29, at one time the youngest airline captain in the country, admitted blackmail - though the kidnap never took place because he had been double-crossed by his co-defendant, David James, a private detective, who was earlier acquitted of blackmail. Shadwell, of Alderley Edge in Cheshire, claimed that after his home and car were repossessed he had hatched the plot with James to kidnap Dawood Pervez, an Oxford student whose elder brother he had known at public school. Shadwell said he paid \u00a350,000 to James after the detective had called and falsely said he had kidnapped Dawood. Sentencing Shadwell, Judge Stanley Spence commented: \"You were abused by a thoroughly dishonest co-defendant into believing the kidnap had taken place.\" James was earlier acquitted on the judge's order. He had claimed he was paid by Shadwell to follow relatives of Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson and BA chief executive Bob Ayling, which Shadwell denied. Shadwell, who had been employed by a BA subsidiary on \u00a340,000, sent Mr Pervez letters demanding \u00a31m. He was picked up by police after collecting a planted briefcase of money. Peter Nightingale, defending, said Shadwell was gay and had lived in a \"false world\", finding it difficult to admit his true feelings and becoming a binge spender; despite his \u00a3100,000 debts, he had put down \u00a3500 on a \u00a375,000 Mercedes. Police seek email date conwoman Police are looking for an internet temptress who calls herself Kirsty and cons her dates out of money. Her latest victim, Jamie Darlington, 17, a computer worker from Waltham Abbey in Essex, had an email romance for a month before being persuaded to travel more than 250 miles for a date on New Year's Eve. When the two met in Southampton, where he had booked five nights at a hotel, \"Kirsty\" asked him for \u00a3105 for some party tickets she said she had bought them, then got out of their taxi. The teenager was still waiting in the taxi when he got a message on his mobile: \"You are the most gullible person in the world. Thanks for the money - it will come in handy... Ha ha ha.\" Police in Southampton think many other men have also been tricked but are embarrassed to come forward. The teenager said yesterday: \"We used to exchange regular emails. In the middle of one internet conversation, she asked me what I was doing on New Year's Eve. \"I said that I was thinking about going into work to earn some extra money. At that point, she invited me to Southampton and said we could go to some nightclubs. She wanted me to send some money in advance but I was a bit wary and said 'no'.\" \"Kirsty\" used the email address luckgirlSO15, suggesting by the postcode reference that she was from Southampton. She was ginger-blonde and possibly in her late teens, told her victim she was a hairdresser and left a black leather handbag containing an empty Barbie doll box in the taxi. Police yesterday released a photo of a woman wanted in connection with the fraud. Cannabis smuggler, 76, jailed A great-grandfather was jailed yesterday for six years for his part in a cannabis smuggling ring. Joseph Causton, 76, appeared to run a respectable business, ABC Canned Fruit Wholesale, importing cans of Spanish plum tomatoes. But a consignment concealed high-grade cannabis resin, worth up to \u00a35m on the streets, for distribution across Britain, Snaresbrook crown court in London was told. Judge Peter Ader told Causton: \"You lent to the operation an air of credibility and respectability. Your role was to give an appearance of legitimacy to the business.\" If it had not been for his age he could have expected a sentence of about 10 years, the judge said. Causton, of Dagenham, Essex, who had claimed he was an innocent dupe, had been convicted of possessing 2,061kg of cannabis resin with intent to supply. The court had heard how police uncovered a drug trail which saw the cannabis shipped from North Africa to Marbella, Spain, where it was packed into 4kg cans. Labelled as tomatoes, they joined genuine tins for shipment to Britain. Det Con Lloyd Hales said he believed Causton was Britain's oldest drug-dealer. His son-in-law, Alan Wheeler, 49, is in jail in Spain after being charged in connection with a separate 550kg cannabis haul. The judge said Causton would have to spend at least four years in prison before his sentence could be suspended. He was ordered to pay back \u00a310,492, his total benefit from the drugs operation. The court heard that Causton had a 50-year record of convictions for crimes including receiving stolen goods. School head downloaded child porn A headteacher was yesterday found guilty of possessing indecent pictures of youths under 16, downloaded from the internet on a school computer and his home PC. Robert Shepherd, 52, the suspended head of Holy Trinity Church of England primary school in Cuckfield, West Sussex, was also convicted by Haywards Heath magistrates of misusing a school computer. Shepherd, who is married with four children and lives in Cuckfield, had told the court he accessed the gay porn sites as a \"cry for help\" over having been raped at 18. The case was adjourned for psychological reports before sentencing on March 14, when Shepherd faces being put on the sex offenders' list. Nuclear fuel row 'may cost jobs' British Nuclear Fuels Limited last night admitted that a mistake which led to plutonium-based nuclear fuel being shipped to Japan with part-fabricated paperwork could cost jobs at the \u00a3300m Sellafield reprocessing plant, which has not yet opened. The Japanese government wants the suspect mixed oxide fuel to be returned to Britain after ignoring a British trade delegation's efforts to calm fears this week. Britain has apologised to Hirofumi Kawano, Japan's director-general of the agency of natural resources and energy, and the three BNFL workers blamed for falsifying data on the fuel pellets have been sacked, but a ban on imports of British Mox fuel imposed in December still stands. Tokyo's intransigence is a potential blow to BNFL, which is reported to count on Japan for 60% of its operating profits. Japan is also the biggest potential customer for the new Sellafield reprocessing plant, sparking fears of job losses and that the plant could be in serious trouble even before it goes into full operation. BNFL are to send their own delegation of senior managers to the customer, Kansai Electric Power, but last night, after GMB union bosses had warned that the problem could have an impact on the workforce, a BNFL spokeswoman said: \"The GMB obviously have got their members' concerns at heart but, yes, the worst case scenario would be job losses.\" The nuclear installations inspectorate is due to publish a report on the falsification incident next week. It is understood to recommend \"radical measures\" to ensure there is no repeat.",

      "bodyText": "The new wife of a Labour MP whose former wife claimed he beat her told a court yesterday: \"He is the kindest person I have ever met.\" Laura Wray, a solicitor, who married Jimmy Wray last July, said the only flaws in his character were untidiness and an obsession with DIY \"which he doesn't get round to finishing\". His former wife, Catherine Wray, claims that the MP for Glasgow Baillieston \"battered and abused\" her during their marriage, that he punched her, held a knife to her neck and grabbed her by the throat. Mr Wray, 64, who contests her claims, is suing Associated Newspapers for \u00a31.5m in the court of session in Edinburgh for defamation over an account of their marriage in the Mail on Sunday in 1998. The paper says its story is true. Catherine Wray, 50, of Milngavie, Glasgow, became the second wife of Mr Wray, a former boxer, in 1985. They separated 10 years later. Yesterday Laura Wray, 38, told the court that the portrayal of her husband in the newspaper was not one she recognised \"at all\". She said she met him in the House of Commons in 1994 through her work, and lobbied his support for a campaign over tobacco-related illness. They married when their divorces came through. They had a son, Frankie, in summer 1998. She told the court: \"He is the most easy-going, even-tempered person I have ever met. I don't think he has ever lost his temper. We have had the odd argument over domestic matters.\" She said he hated bad language. \"If somebody so much as swears, he objects and says he doesn't like to hear that kind of thing in front of a woman, especially his wife.\" Mrs Wray disputed his former wife's claim that he was possessive. \"I wouldn't describe him as possessive so much as caring,\" she said. When he learned of the Mail on Sunday story, her husband was \"shocked and visibly white. We both felt completely deflated and upset\". In the following weeks, she said, \"he was very ill looking. He had heart palpitations at one point. He became depressed and withdrawn. He needed constant reassurance that I wasn't going to up and leave him. \"I still think he seems to lack the kind of ebullience he once had _ he is much less willing to put his head above the parapet.\" He was a \"very caring father\" to Frankie, who has development problems.",

ITV's success is partly due to a reinvigorated Saturday night performance, which accounted for 13 of its top 100 entries. But the report contained bad news for the two mainstream channels, with increased competition eating into their audiences. On average, the top 100 programmes last year were viewed by 12.4m people, less than a quarter of the maximum potential audience, whereas in 1993 the equivalent figure was 14.3m. Carlton's inability to produce hit programmes continued with Carlton and Central, which it owns, contributing seven shows compared with the Granada group's 31. Despite BBC1 spending \u00a3558m and ITV \u00a3670m on shows, little fresh programming impacted on the top 100, with soaps, game shows and light dramas dominating. A BBC spokesperson said: \"We don't judge ourselves by pure numbers, we have different barometers of our success The BBC is here to do different things from ITV. We aim to give all licence fee payers a nourishing schedule filled with quality and diversity.\" An ITV spokeswoman said: \"1999 was a terrific year because we grew our share in peak time by 1% which was our target. ITV is a commercial channel which has a very simple ambition, which is to appeal to the largest possible audience.\" But the ratings boom for ITV may be ending. Last month its peak time share fell by 2% compared with January 1999, meaning that on average 500,000 fewer viewers see the programmes it relies on most to generate advertising revenues. Last year saw BBC1 record its lowest audience figures for the second year running, falling to 28.3%.",

That is this report. Since December, the commission has held further discussions with representatives of the IRA, the UVF and the UFF. 2 Our previous report stated our belief that the results of the Mitchell review and the designation of IRA and UFF contacts, in addition to the UVF contact already in place, gave the basis for an assessment that decommissioning will happen. While we believe that conclusion was well founded we await further evidence to substantiate it. 3 The IRA contact has assured us of the unequivocal continuing support of his organisation for the current political process. We have been made aware of, and recognise, the difficulties facing the IRA leadership in moving on decommissioning at this time. We are also conscious that the maintenance of the ceasefire, and of those of the UVF and UFF, have played and continue to play, an important part in the political advances that have been achieved to date and that are progressing. Further, our contact has very recently emphasised that there is no threat to the peace process from the IRA. All of these factors are significant. But our sole task is decommissioning and to date we have received no information from the IRA as to when decommissioning will start. 4 In our most recent discussion with the UVF contact, he reminded us of the discussions he held with the commission over a long period, including the UVF's early engagement on the issues of modalities. He has also reiterated the UVF stance that while it is prepared to consider moving on decommissioning, it will not do so until it has received an unequivocal statement from the IRA that the war is over. 5 Similarly, our most recent discussion with the representatives of the UFF has confirmed their position stated during our earlier meeting, to the effect that while that group too is prepared to consider moving on decommissioning, it will not do so until it is clear the IRA will decommission. 6 We will continue our efforts to continue the commission's role in the manner and within the time-frame approved by the political parties and the two governments.

Nor did Sinn Fein appear to believe Mr Mandelson would suspend.</p> <p>Mr Trimble's wrong-footing move threw that analysis into disarray. But the Sunday newspapers continued to publish details of how and when decommissioning was about to take place, much to the bemusement of General John de Chastelain, chairman of the Independent Commission on Decommissioning.</p> <p>British and Irish officials believe Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness would like to see IRA decommissioning. It would open up electoral possibilities for Sinn Fein both sides of the Irish border. But they agree Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness face a delicate task, with dissident republicans, like those responsible for last Sunday's bomb attack in Co Fermanagh, trying to entice disenchanted IRA members. They believe the dynamic within republicanism has changed in the past two months, and think Mr Trimble's move to put in public the nods and winks in private were a key.</p> <p>It will be hard to avoid the blame game over the next few weeks.

But it could be crucial. Trimble loyalists are less likely to turn up, and the council's complexion will be more hardline than in November.

      "body": "<p>Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, yesterday reluctantly announced the restoration of direct rule from midnight last night as Northern Ireland's unique experiment in inclusive government ended in angry farce after 72 days.</p> <p>Sinn Fein announced a new IRA initiative only after Mr Mandelson had already signed the papers returning power to Westminster.</p> <p>Government sources were furious. They said that Sinn Fein had earlier refused to divulge all the details of a fresh offer either to General John de Chastelain, chairman of the International Commission on Decommissioning, or to Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble. Mr Mandelson also said last night he was unaware of what it contained.</p> <p>Minutes before Mr Mandelson's announcement of the suspension, Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, released a statement reporting a \"major breakthrough\" after frantic negotiations involving London, Dublin and Washington.</p> <p>He said the IRA was willing to set out the context in which it would decommission. Mr Adams hailed it as a development of \"enormous significance\".</p> <p>He believed that taken with the IRA's recent statements conceding that the issue of arms had to be addressed, and that it was no threat to the peace process, it would prompt a positive report from Gen de Chastelain.</p> <p>That report, produced quickly last night for the governments, was said to give no clear answer to the two key issues: will the IRA decommission and, if so, when? It was still to be released late last night, but Mr Adams called for its publication.</p> <p>The two governments did publish Gen de Chastelain's report of January 31. It referred to the IRA linkman outlining its ongoing support for the peace process, but the commission said it had received no information as to when IRA decommissioning would start.</p> <p>It also indicated it would soon be unable to oversee the completion of decommissioning by May 22, the deadline in the Good Friday agreement, if there was no quick beginning.</p> <p>Mr Adams accused Mr Mandelson of moving pre-emptively to suspend. He said Mr Mandelson had caved in to Ulster Unionist threats, making the situation more difficult.</p> <p>Mr Adams said: \"Peter Mandelson was kept fully informed of all of this. He has signed the papers in the knowledge that there was a major breakthrough. It is ridiculous to suggest that he was not conscious or aware of what was happening.\"</p> <p>But Mr Mandelson countered: \"I still don't know what the offer was because I haven't seen it. The first I knew of Mr Adams' statement was 20 minutes after I suspended the institutions.\"</p> <p>Ulster Unionists suspected Mr Adams was trying to deflect blame. They said that Sinn Fein's statement took them by suprise.</p> <p>Mr Trimble, who said he was disappointed at the return to direct rule, said: \"The best information available to me is there were no significant breakthroughs. Although I had a meeting with Martin McGuinness and a conversa tion on the telephone with Mr Adams, they had nothing to put to me. Suspension became inevitable.\"</p> <p>Mr Trimble agreed in November to form the power-sharing executive with Sinn Fein after promising his party's 860-strong ruling council he would quit as first minister before today's reconvened meeting if there was no start by then to IRA decommissioning. He calculated it was the only way to win party backing for the move.</p> <p>The bitter recriminations underscored the difficulties ahead in resurecting the Good Friday agreement, now 22 months old. Mr Mandelson was unhappy at suspending, but believed allowing Mr Trimble to quit would have meant the end of the agreement.</p> <p>Dublin, taking the lead in negotiations with the IRA, was unhappy at suspension, and pushed in vain for the institutions to be put on ice for three weeks.</p> <p>The IRA's offer may be a good starting point to the second review of the agreement. Mr Mandelson said there had been movement, but the IRA had still to confirm it would decommission.</p> <p>He said: \"I regret very much having to do this. But we have got to clear up this issue of decommissioning once and for all. It has dogged the process throughout, and it has sapped confidence in the institutions. Real progress has been made, but not sufficient for me to withold suspension at this stage.\"</p> <p>Direct rule was last imposed in May 1974, following the collapse of the five-month Sunningdale executive. It was finally collapsed by the loyalist workers' strike, spearheaded by paramilitaries.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson said ex-US senator George Mitchell, who chaired the talks leading the the agreement and last autumn's 11-week review, would not be returning.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, yesterday reluctantly announced the restoration of direct rule from midnight last night as Northern Ireland's unique experiment in inclusive government ended in angry farce after 72 days. Sinn Fein announced a new IRA initiative only after Mr Mandelson had already signed the papers returning power to Westminster. Government sources were furious. They said that Sinn Fein had earlier refused to divulge all the details of a fresh offer either to General John de Chastelain, chairman of the International Commission on Decommissioning, or to Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble. Mr Mandelson also said last night he was unaware of what it contained. Minutes before Mr Mandelson's announcement of the suspension, Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, released a statement reporting a \"major breakthrough\" after frantic negotiations involving London, Dublin and Washington. He said the IRA was willing to set out the context in which it would decommission. Mr Adams hailed it as a development of \"enormous significance\". He believed that taken with the IRA's recent statements conceding that the issue of arms had to be addressed, and that it was no threat to the peace process, it would prompt a positive report from Gen de Chastelain. That report, produced quickly last night for the governments, was said to give no clear answer to the two key issues: will the IRA decommission and, if so, when? It was still to be released late last night, but Mr Adams called for its publication. The two governments did publish Gen de Chastelain's report of January 31. It referred to the IRA linkman outlining its ongoing support for the peace process, but the commission said it had received no information as to when IRA decommissioning would start. It also indicated it would soon be unable to oversee the completion of decommissioning by May 22, the deadline in the Good Friday agreement, if there was no quick beginning. Mr Adams accused Mr Mandelson of moving pre-emptively to suspend. He said Mr Mandelson had caved in to Ulster Unionist threats, making the situation more difficult. Mr Adams said: \"Peter Mandelson was kept fully informed of all of this. He has signed the papers in the knowledge that there was a major breakthrough. It is ridiculous to suggest that he was not conscious or aware of what was happening.\" But Mr Mandelson countered: \"I still don't know what the offer was because I haven't seen it. The first I knew of Mr Adams' statement was 20 minutes after I suspended the institutions.\" Ulster Unionists suspected Mr Adams was trying to deflect blame. They said that Sinn Fein's statement took them by suprise. Mr Trimble, who said he was disappointed at the return to direct rule, said: \"The best information available to me is there were no significant breakthroughs. Although I had a meeting with Martin McGuinness and a conversa tion on the telephone with Mr Adams, they had nothing to put to me. Suspension became inevitable.\" Mr Trimble agreed in November to form the power-sharing executive with Sinn Fein after promising his party's 860-strong ruling council he would quit as first minister before today's reconvened meeting if there was no start by then to IRA decommissioning. He calculated it was the only way to win party backing for the move. The bitter recriminations underscored the difficulties ahead in resurecting the Good Friday agreement, now 22 months old. Mr Mandelson was unhappy at suspending, but believed allowing Mr Trimble to quit would have meant the end of the agreement. Dublin, taking the lead in negotiations with the IRA, was unhappy at suspension, and pushed in vain for the institutions to be put on ice for three weeks. The IRA's offer may be a good starting point to the second review of the agreement. Mr Mandelson said there had been movement, but the IRA had still to confirm it would decommission. He said: \"I regret very much having to do this. But we have got to clear up this issue of decommissioning once and for all. It has dogged the process throughout, and it has sapped confidence in the institutions. Real progress has been made, but not sufficient for me to withold suspension at this stage.\" Direct rule was last imposed in May 1974, following the collapse of the five-month Sunningdale executive. It was finally collapsed by the loyalist workers' strike, spearheaded by paramilitaries. Mr Mandelson said ex-US senator George Mitchell, who chaired the talks leading the the agreement and last autumn's 11-week review, would not be returning.",

On a Downing Street website, launched yesterday, the nation can now download the wise words of a virtual prime minister at the touch of a button, any time of the day or night. The new site, which leapt into cyberspace with only a few grumblings from journalists unable to get the on-screen prime minister to talk (\"Well, we can hear him in Downing Street,\" said a spokesman), is the government's attempt to drag its communications technology into the same century inhabited by its voters. Tony Blair, a notorious Luddite far outpaced by his wife and children on IT, has been dragged along too, confessing in the first of weekly internet broadcasts to the nation that he is \"sitting here at my desk in Downing Street in front of my PC terminal, which I'm just getting to use after many years of not really wanting to come to terms with the new computer technology\". With his next breath, however, the prime minister is off on more certain ground, launching into a sermon on education. \"Thanks to the reforms of the literacy and numeracy hours, the results for English and maths for the tests for 11- year-olds have shot up to the best ever,\" he says, adding, with more than a flavour of Private Eye's spoof St Albion's Parish News, \"and that's good news.

      "body": "<p>I was there, 30 years ago now, when George Graham first got married. Not a member of the wedding, but a chance onlooker. There was this commotion down our street, so I rushed to our front gate and there was Marie Zia, daughter of our next-door-but-one neighbours, in her full bridal finery, going off to marry George Graham. He was Arsenal's handsome young midfielder, commonly known as Stroller, or sometimes Gorgeous George. Even then, he was always slinky-smart. I gave the bride a wave - plus, being a Spurs supporter, a pretend hiss. </p> <p>I was there, 28 years ago now, when Arsenal won the Double, with George as one of their star players. More hisses. And I was also there, seven years ago now, when they won the Double again, this time with George as their manager. Double hisses all round. </p> <p>But not seriously: despite being a Spurs fan, I've gone to Arsenal matches all these years, watched most of their home games. My first love is football, rather than any one club. Something most football fans don't understand. George does. </p> <p>I was there, too, if only in spirit, on that dramatic day, almost five years ago now, in February 1995, when George Graham got the sack. It had taken him eight-and-a-half years as Arsenal's manager to win six trophies for them. It took Arsenal's board only two-and-a-half minutes to kick him out. It was all to do with George accepting a \"bung\". I remember thinking, \"Oh, no, not George, of all people.\" I could have believed it of many other managers, but George seemed far too clever, too smart, too disciplined. As a manager, he had acquired this almost ascetic, holier-than-them presence. </p> <p>He was banned from football by the FA for a year, but returned to manage Leeds. Then, in another twist, he returned to London 16 months ago, to manage, of all teams, Spurs, Arsenal's traditional and hated rival. Most Spurs fans found this hard to take. I welcomed it. I thought that the fury he must have felt at Arsenal's treatment of him would act as an extra spur. </p> <p>He has refused to talk in recent years about Arsenal and the bung affair, though I hoped to drag it into the conversation, at some stage, if he appeared in a good mood. Then again, George Graham is not known for his good moods, either with his players or with the press. </p> <p>It was a Saturday midday - an extra training day, in preparation for a Monday-evening match - cold and chilly. The players trooped off the training pitches, letting out white steam like sweating horses. Spurs' newly-built, plush training ground is at Chigwell in Essex: rural close up, but surrounded by noisy motorways. </p> <p>I followed Graham into his office. Over his door, the sign said, \"Head Coach\". When I pointed this out, he didn't seem to be aware of the wording. But you're the manager, George, aren't you? </p> <p>\"I certainly am. I insisted on it in my contract. I wanted to be hired as manager. The previous manager [Christian Gross] had called himself Head Coach, in the continental fashion. I was having none of that. I'll change it sometime, but I've had other things to do first. Everyone knows I am the manager.\" How true. </p> <p>His office is neat, spare, immaculate, just like George himself. At the age of 55, he is roughly of the same generation as Manchester United's manager, Alex Ferguson, but looks about two decades younger, and fitter. Fergie's managerial career has been without a major blip, yet he now looks puffy, unhealthy. George's managerial nightmare might have driven weaker men to suicide, yet he radiates health and energy, as lean, toned and smooth as he appeared in his playing days. His hair is still Celtic dark. There's a bit of a bald patch at the back, sure, but no need to mention that. Not if I'm hoping to get on to the bung. </p> <p>Graham puts his passion for clothes, and his desire to be always well turned-out, down to the poverty and deprivations of his childhood. He was born in Bargeddie, outside Glasgow, on November 30, 1944, St Andrew's Day. (He shares a birthday with Winston Churchill and Gary Winston Lineker.) His father was a steelworker, who died when George was just three weeks old, leaving his mother to bring up seven children on her own. George has no memory of ever getting any new clothes until he was over 13. He wore hand-me-downs from his older brothers and sisters. George lived for football as a boy, as most footballers do. \"And I never had any doubts I would make it.\" </p> <p>Surely you merely hoped, rather than expected? \"No, I was one of the most talented in my area - played for Lanarkshire, then Scotland Schoolboys - so I was encouraged from the beginning to believe that I would become a professional.\" </p> <p>At 15, he had offers from Aston Villa, Chelsea and Newcastle, went to see them all, inspected their premises, listened to their promises. Plus their extra inducements? \"There were none.\" </p> <p>George stops smiling, suddenly doesn't appear quite so sleek, so charming. He narrows his eyes, knowing only too well what I might be leading up to. But it was normal then, I suggested, and still is, for schoolboy stars to be offered little treats: a free holiday, perhaps, or a new car for their mum and dad; sometimes even a house, as in the case of Paul Gascoigne, or so it was alleged at the time. </p> <p>\"Nothing - I got offered nothing, and I took nothing.\" </p> <p>He joined Villa, mainly because of the fatherly figure of Joe Mercer, whom his mother and older brother, Andy, liked. Then, in 1964, he moved on to Chelsea and, two years later, to Arsenal. It was the Arsenal move that changed his attitudes, to life and football. \"It had been all fun at Chelsea, the swinging 60s, lots of good times, living it up. It was a real jolt coming to Arsenal, because they were much more disciplined. It took me two years to get used to it. I had a lot of knocks at Arsenal.\" </p> <p>Knocks? My memory of George, the Gorgeous Stroller, quick in the mind if not always in foot, is of him being a vital part of the team, one of the team's recognised stars. I tell him I find it strange that he didn't see it that way at the time. \"Oh no. I was very often dropped, though that wasn't always said in public. Bertie Mee often left me out. He'd say I needed a challenge. It had a good effect on me, because that was when I first began to think to myself, 'I'll show them.' \" </p> <p>Which, of course, he did, when all those medals were won. Yet, when the time came for him to retire from football, he never thought of trying to stay in the game. \"I had no confidence, you see.\" </p> <p>Oh, come on, George. I can't think of anyone who exudes more confidence. </p> <p>\"As a player, yes, but at that stage I really had no confidence about being a coach. I had worked under Dave Sexton, Don Howe, Bertie Mee, and I could see that they were brilliant coaches. I could also see that my friend Terry Venables [best man at George's wedding] was going to be a brilliant manager. I knew that I couldn't compete with any of them. They were just so good. Honestly, coaching never entered my head. They were clearly gifted. I wasn't. </p> <p>\"I also had no desire to stay in football. As a player, I wasn't exactly a keen trainer. I was more interested in finishing and going off for a vodka and coke, or chasing the lassies. People I played with, knowing my lifestyle at the time, would never have predicted I'd become a manager. Frank McClintock [Arsenal's captain] still makes jokes about that whenever I meet him. </p> <p>\"George Graham, the footballer, is not the sort of person that George Graham, the manager, would want in his team . . . What I thought I'd do was run a pub. I started working in one owned by Frank. I pulled pints for several months, learned about the cellars, all the skulduggery to look out for. I was planning to buy my own pub when one day I got a call from Terry. </p> <p>\"He had become manager at Crystal Palace. He asked if I'd like to be his youth team coach. I had no coaching certificates, no training, no interest, really, but Terry said he thought I could do it. He said give it a year. If you don't like it, then fine, go off and buy your pub. I learned almost at once, in just a few weeks, that I loved teaching. I'd never been aware of that. So wasn't that lucky? </p> <p>\"So much of life, and football, is luck - if Terry had not rung me when he did, I would not be in football today. When I look at the success David O'Leary has made at Leeds since he took over [O'Leary was assistant manager when Graham left the club - somewhat acrimoniously, it must be said - for Spurs], I think back to the twist of fate that took him there. When I got the Leeds job, after my year out of football, I wanted to take Stewart Houston as my number two. He'd worked with me at Arsenal. But, by then, he'd got a manager's job at QPR, so I didn't offer it to him, though I would have done. Instead, I thought I'd try David, even though he was so young and inexperienced. I'd give him a chance. But even I didn't realise how brilliant he would turn out to be.\" </p> <p>Today, at Spurs, however, George has got Stewart Houston as his number two. Together, they have done a fair job - so far. Spurs won the Worthington Cup last season, and this season they have stuffed Arsenal at White Hart Lane, which cheered up every Spurs fan, and have also beaten Manchester United. </p> <p>On his arrival at Spurs in October 1998, on his first day at training, George got them outside on a grassy bank, all the players and coaching staff, and gave them the George Graham managerial pep talk, along the lines he's given a few times before. </p> <p>Saying what? \"Oh, just to tell them what I believe in.\" </p> <p>Yes, but what exactly? </p> <p>\"I told them, first, how fortunate they were to be in a job that was their living, but also their hobby, their love. I said not many people today can say that. I also pointed out how well rewarded they were, for following their hobby. I said what I look for in all players is technical ability, application, desire, ambition. If they are to stay at this club, then ambition is absolutely vital. I didn't want anyone here for the fun of it, to see out their career, put in a few years. I am here to win things, not have fun. The fun will be in the winning, when it comes. </p> <p>\"Looking around, I said I can see some amazing talent here. But, looking around, I can also see a lot of under-achieving. My job is to put that right. And, together, we'll achieve things.\" Good stuff, George. Let's hope some cheered, or at least puffed out their manly chests. </p> <p>Having delivered the message, he went on to make some immediate changes. \"Mobile phones were banned on the team coach. I ordered blazers to be worn by all the first team on match days.\" </p> <p>Blazers? You mean like back in the dark ages? I remember in the 70s, when I was following Spurs around, blazers were in, but I thought they'd gone, along with crinolines, except for cup finals. \"Oh, but I believe in them. The top Italian and Spanish clubs all wear them and look immaculate. I want footballers to have that sort of image, to be seen as great professionals, just as much as lawyers or doctors.\" </p> <p>On the team coach, on the way to the hotel, he does allow them to wear tracksuits, but once his players leave the hotel, heading for the ground, they must all be in club blazers. \"They're quite subtle, actually, in navy. There's not a proper badge, just a small cockerel. Quite discreet.\" </p> <p>He then imposed a new reign of terror - sorry, strict discipline - on the Tottenham training. Anyone who is even a minute late gets fined. Just a nominal amount, \u00a350, which doubles each time the offence is repeated. As the training ground is surrounded by so many hellish roads where hold-ups are frequent, this makes it rather tough. \"For a first offence, from, say, a new player, it's a warning only. After that, the fines start.\" (The fines, by the way, all go to charity, to Great Ormond Street Hospital. Last season, they received \u00a34,500.) </p> <p>George, you're not going soft in your middle years? </p> <p>\"It's not being petty insisting on punctuality, or wanting to be seen with a big whip - it's a matter of having a sense of professionalism. By turning up late, you are showing lack of respect for me, for the coaching staff, and also for your fellow players, whom you expect just to wait around for you to arrive. I want all players to have respect for other players.\" </p> <p>The treatment room at Spurs had become something of a standing joke for a good few years. Fans, both at Tottenham and around the country, made fun of players who seemed to spend their life there - Darren Anderton, for instance, is still referred to as Sick Note, having played fewer than 100 games in five years (top-flight players might reasonably expect to play at least 50 games a season). \"I have never accused any player of putting on an injury,\" says Graham, \"but what can happen is that the treatment room becomes too comfortable, so they stay too long, having nice massages. When I arrived, I changed the treatment hours - the last session now finishes at 4pm. That's just about the moment when the M25 becomes absolutely hellish. It's surprising how many people now manage to get out of the treatment room well ahead of the rush hour.\" </p> <p>As for changes to the team and tactics, they, too, have been noticeable to all. For the past 20 years, as a Spurs fan, I have had to close my eyes every time the other team got over the halfway line, for fear that our defence would either flap or freeze. We have had some good individuals -such as Hoddle, Waddle and Gazza - over the years, but rarely a solid defence. \"I think that became a psychological crutch for Spurs. During the years when their fans shouted 'boring, boring Arsenal', they comforted themselves by saying, 'Well, we might not win things, but at least we have the better players.' That was just an excuse. The whole team has not been good enough for a long time.\" </p> <p>George has clearly worked on the defence. It's not yet as solid as Arsenal's, but it is a lot better than it was. At Arsenal, he put into his defenders' minds the image of being tied together on the same piece of rope. A neat image. But was it original? \"I got the idea from watching the great Liverpool team. They always moved up and down as one unit, never as individuals, as if tied together. I was trying to explain how they had done it.\" Under George, for example, Stephen Carr, the young Irish fullback, has blossomed, and our goalkeeper, Ian Walker, no longer makes me scream - he used to take forever with his kicks. \"Yes, that was one change I made. It wasn't just a matter of wasting time, but losing the team's momentum.\" </p> <p>David Ginola, our only recognisable heart-stopper in recent years, was expected not to survive under Graham's managership; everyone - press, fans, me - thought that he and his lovely locks [not for nothing is Ginola the face of L'Or\u00e9al] would be on their way, not only for his habit of sometimes fannying around, losing the ball, then putting his hands on his waist and sighing, but also because Graham has a reputation for being unwilling to accommodate flair players. Today, however, Ginola works hard all the time, and last season was voted Player of the Year, both by his fellow professionals and by the football press. This season, he's not been quite as consistent. \"He hasn't been at his best recently, but that happens to all players. Look at Dennis Bergkamp [Arsenal's current star player]. He often has poor spells. It's just not true I don't like creative players. I do. But, in future, I think we'll stop talking about 'creative midfield players'. All players should be all-rounders.\" </p> <p>So I asked about Allan Nielsen, the Danish midfielder, who has not figured in the team much since George arrived, and appears to have been replaced by Steffen Freund, the hard-tackling German. Was George not a fan? \"It's not that. It's just that I didn't want a midfield man who goes forward as much as Allan does. I prefer the men in the middle to stay put, let the fullbacks do the forward attacks. So Allan didn't quite suit my formation. But that might change. And we do need him.\" </p> <p>What Spurs mainly needs, or so all Spurs fans believe, is some decent strikers. \"We probably need up to four new players to achieve success,\" says Graham. \"But, for that, I'll need \u00a320 million.\" </p> <p> So why doesn't Alan Sugar, the club chairman, let you have it? \"Alan Sugar is as keen as I am that I should find strikers, but we both feel that the club should not be held to ransom. Strikers these days cost fortunes. Leeds have been looking for a good one for a year. And they can afford more than I can.\" All the same, he feels that he is ahead of his game-plan. In his first season, his main aim was to avoid relegation; in the event, Tottenham finished safely in mid-table and won a cup. This season, Graham's aim is to finish in the top six, and thereby qualify for a European competition next year. With a third of the season to go, that is still within their reach. After that, it all depends on whether he gets those new players. \"I'm told that, by finishing in the top three, a club can make as much as \u00a340 million. But, of course, you need to invest \u00a320 million to do that. It's like life. You have to speculate to accumulate.\" </p> <p>Which brings us to his own little bit of accumulation. The \"bung\" details are complicated, but, in simple terms, George accepted two lumps of cash, totalling \u00a3425,000, from a Norwegian football agent with whom George, as manager of Arsenal, had been involved in various transfer deals. He had also helped this agent, giving him advice and contacts in British football in general. George, therefore, so he says, looked upon this money as an unsolicited gift. He didn't see it as having strings attached, either before or after. At the time, he didn't appear to see anything wrong at all. Arsenal, the club, didn't lose out. His \"gifts\" had come out of a middleman's pocket. No one, so he maintained, was cheated. </p> <p>Anyway, he lost his job at Arsenal, was banned by the FA from football for a year, but he did hand over all the money, with interest. So he gained nothing in the end. In fact, he lost money - in legal fees, plus around \u00a32 million in loss of earnings. Most of all, he lost a reputation. </p> <p>My reaction at the time, and those of many other fans, was to shrug and put it down to the culture of football, in which footballers have been brought up. As schoolboy stars, they are tempted with brown envelopes (though remember that George never was). As young first-team stars, they get used to free gifts, TV sets, cars. If they get to Wembley, they can make a nice profit selling their ticket allowance - against football's laws, yes, but it's always been done. Then, when they attain real stardom, there can be back-handers on transfers and contracts. That's what I believe, anyway. </p> <p>Then, in the world of management, should they get there, bung allegations have been heard for years at clubs throughout the divisions. In Alex Ferguson's recent book, for example, the Manchester United manager reveals that he once received \u00a340,000 in cash from a Russian agent for no apparent reason, though, sensibly, he shoved it in a safe and later returned it. The point is, most of us assume football has always been awash with readies, since the very first transfers began. </p> <p>\"This is you saying all this,\" replied George, after I had described what I like to think I know about football. \"It's not me saying it.\" </p> <p>Okay, then, do you regret it? </p> <p>\"Of course I do. I was wrong to accept the money. I concede that greed got the better of me. I should not have done it. But, really, is it any different from big business? It's commonplace in the commercial world for such gifts to be given - and received.\" </p> <p>He is clearly still incensed by the part Arsenal played, or didn't play, in the drama. It did look at the time as if the club must have known, or suspected, that such things were going on and, therefore, shared some of the responsibility. When the story first came out, in a newspaper expos\u00e9, George looked as though he would survive the storm. Behind the scenes, so he says, he had made an arrangement with Arsenal to leave quietly at the end of the season with an appropriate compensation. Then, suddenly, on February 21, 1995, he was told to clear his desk and received not a penny. He considers this a total stab in the back. </p> <p>The reasons are still a mystery. What, or who, made Arsenal suddenly change their mind? Did they fear other things coming out, or about other people? We still don't know. </p> <p>\"I don't want to talk about it. I never do, if I can help it. It's in the past. I have to be positive. What I did has made me grow up as a person. I could very well have collapsed. It's how you conduct yourself after such things have happened, that's what matters. I did not run away from it. I faced it, have overcome it, and like to think I am stronger by it.\" </p> <p>In some ways, it has made him a more understanding manager, more aware of the weaknesses of others than he was. Though not by a great deal. The George Graham school of management is still very much based on strong discipline, even a bit of fear. No player would dare give him cheek to his face, or even call him by his first name. Some managers believe that some players need a hug, need cheering up or an arm around their shoulder. Brian Little was good at this - but, in the end, it didn't get him far. There are those who believe star players need an extra bit of attention and leniency, just because, well, they are stars. Ron Atkinson was a bit prone to this. </p> <p>George belongs to neither of these schools. \"Perhaps I have got a bit softer than I was, compared with my Arsenal days. There, I was probably a bit hard on people such as Martin Keown, who can be a bit hyper-sensitive and nervous. I was probably a bit too tough on him at times, put too much pressure on him. I still wouldn't hug a player, but I think I'm more understanding of their feelings than I used to be. My basic belief, however, is still the same. I'm not interested in this idea of pressure. The man in the street has just as many pressures as footballers. I don't sympathise with those players who can't take the strain.\" </p> <p>In a book he wrote in 1995, Glory And The Grief, George laid out 10 commandments for young players, listing the things they should do or follow in order to succeed. I asked if he had some similar rules for managers, now that he's had 20 years in management. He didn't know if he could manage 10, he said, but he'd have a go . . . </p> <p>1) A manager must lay down at any club that he is the leader, more than the chairman, more than any star player. He must instil his character into the fabric of the whole club. That's what Alex Ferguson has done at Manchester United. I believe that 99% of people prefer to be led. Only 1% are leaders. </p> <p>2) I'm not against some players earning more than others, but once they come through my door they are all equal, and get treated equally, no matter who they are or what they have done. I don't make allowances for anyone. I make my rules clear, and everyone has to obey them. </p> <p>3) A manager has to be a bit of a psychologist. This takes time to acquire, comes with experience, knowing how to handle players, but I've also learned by reading about it, especially American books on sports psychology. </p> <p>4) A manager also has to be a bit of an actor. It's not a matter of lying - just not giving the whole truth. You can't tell the press, TV and radio what's really going on. Nor, sometimes, the players. You need a bit of acting when handling them. With the media, in my Arsenal days, I was deliberately not very media-friendly. Now, I like to think I'm more approachable. </p> <p>5) A manager must not want to be popular. A manager has to expect to be disliked. You must realise every decision will upset someone. I have never gone through my management life wanting to be liked. Being disliked doesn't bother me. </p> <p>Not bad, George, for straight off, but then, he is a very clever manager, and very fluent. He also had quite a bit of time to think about the arts of management during his enforced year out of the game, during those moments when he wasn't cultivating his garden. In fact, once I'd got him started, he could hardly stop. The teacher in him was just clamouring to come out. \"There are basically three types of managers,\" he continued. \"There's the training-ground manager, who likes to take a group of players and work on them until they have improved. There's the cheque-book manager, who builds teams by going out and buying players - it does take skill to do this, as a cheque will never guarantee success. Then there's the media manager, who is on TV and radio all the time, who is publicity-friendly and good at PR.\" </p> <p>So which are you George? </p> <p>\"The first type, of course. I leave you to put names to the other types.\" </p> <p>Apart from football management, and the theory thereof, George is also interested in football history. At Christie's in Glasgow in 1989, during the first sale of football memorabilia by a leading auction house, he bid for Alex James's 1930 Arsenal FA Cup Final medal, which was estimated at \u00a31,000. George bid \u00a31,500. It went for \u00a35,000. He has successfully bought other stuff, mainly of Arsenal interest: he has 18 out of a set of 30 Arsenal cartoon postcards from 1904. \"I think the only complete set in existence is in Woolwich Library.\" He's also proud of his programme for the match between Arsenal and Leicester Fosse in 1913. \"It's in mint condition and, of course, very significant.\" How come? \"It was Arsenal's first game at Highbury. Didn't you know that? I thought you were a collector. Arsenal won 2-1.\" </p> <p>I collect Spurs memorabilia, which he does not appear to be into so far, which surprised me. Bit of an insult to Spurs? </p> <p>\"No, it's not. I just haven't had time. Anyway, most of my Arsenal stuff is packed away.\" </p> <p>He has also kept some Arsenal shares, which he bought when he was at the club, as an investment. \"I'm keeping them because they should go up more, once the plans are announced for their new stadium. It will hold a lot more people, so that will make the club and the shares more valuable.\" He has some share options at Spurs, as part of his contract, but has so far not taken them. Not a bad judge, obviously: my own Spurs shares cost \u00a31 each when I bought them, and they were about 60p last time I looked. \"Davor Suker of Arsenal has bought shares in Man Utd, which is interesting. Perhaps, in future, clubs might offer shares to foreign players when they come here. It could be an extra inducement for them to play well, and, therefore, share in the success. It hasn't happened, as far as I know. Just an idea.\" </p> <p>What about the Arsenal's coat of arms that was rumoured to have been set into the patio of his Hampstead apartment? It was a particularly heated talking point among Spurs fans when he first arrived. \"That's just a myth. It never happened. Anyway, I don't live in that apartment any more.\" He recently moved into a new house, still in Hampstead, with his new American wife, Susan, whom he has known for six years. She was married before and has four children. George's first marriage, alas, collapsed some years ago, but he remains very close to his two children, Nicole, 31, an ardent football fan who went to all his Arsenal games, and those at Leeds, and who now passionately follows Spurs; and Daniel, 26, who is not interested in football - he prefers golf. Both went to school at Dame Alice Owen's in Potters Bar. Nicole went to Homerton College in Cambridge, and became a schoolteacher. She is currently a full-time wife and mother to 14-month old Mark, George's first grandchild. </p> <p>George has said that Arsenal ruined his first marriage: as a player, he explains, you have half of every day free and can be home at one o'clock; as a manager, you can't. At Arsenal, he was hardly ever at home, working and travelling all hours. Eventually his wife, so it was reported, went off with a drycleaner, which gave the tabloids a good excuse for a headline: \"George gets taken to the cleaners.\" </p> <p>Yes, Arsenal has a lot to answer for . . .</p>",

      "bodyText": "I was there, 30 years ago now, when George Graham first got married. Not a member of the wedding, but a chance onlooker. There was this commotion down our street, so I rushed to our front gate and there was Marie Zia, daughter of our next-door-but-one neighbours, in her full bridal finery, going off to marry George Graham. He was Arsenal's handsome young midfielder, commonly known as Stroller, or sometimes Gorgeous George. Even then, he was always slinky-smart. I gave the bride a wave - plus, being a Spurs supporter, a pretend hiss. I was there, 28 years ago now, when Arsenal won the Double, with George as one of their star players. More hisses. And I was also there, seven years ago now, when they won the Double again, this time with George as their manager. Double hisses all round. But not seriously: despite being a Spurs fan, I've gone to Arsenal matches all these years, watched most of their home games. My first love is football, rather than any one club. Something most football fans don't understand. George does. I was there, too, if only in spirit, on that dramatic day, almost five years ago now, in February 1995, when George Graham got the sack. It had taken him eight-and-a-half years as Arsenal's manager to win six trophies for them. It took Arsenal's board only two-and-a-half minutes to kick him out. It was all to do with George accepting a \"bung\". I remember thinking, \"Oh, no, not George, of all people.\" I could have believed it of many other managers, but George seemed far too clever, too smart, too disciplined. As a manager, he had acquired this almost ascetic, holier-than-them presence. He was banned from football by the FA for a year, but returned to manage Leeds. Then, in another twist, he returned to London 16 months ago, to manage, of all teams, Spurs, Arsenal's traditional and hated rival. Most Spurs fans found this hard to take. I welcomed it. I thought that the fury he must have felt at Arsenal's treatment of him would act as an extra spur. He has refused to talk in recent years about Arsenal and the bung affair, though I hoped to drag it into the conversation, at some stage, if he appeared in a good mood. Then again, George Graham is not known for his good moods, either with his players or with the press. It was a Saturday midday - an extra training day, in preparation for a Monday-evening match - cold and chilly. The players trooped off the training pitches, letting out white steam like sweating horses. Spurs' newly-built, plush training ground is at Chigwell in Essex: rural close up, but surrounded by noisy motorways. I followed Graham into his office. Over his door, the sign said, \"Head Coach\". When I pointed this out, he didn't seem to be aware of the wording. But you're the manager, George, aren't you? \"I certainly am. I insisted on it in my contract. I wanted to be hired as manager. The previous manager [Christian Gross] had called himself Head Coach, in the continental fashion. I was having none of that. I'll change it sometime, but I've had other things to do first. Everyone knows I am the manager.\" How true. His office is neat, spare, immaculate, just like George himself. At the age of 55, he is roughly of the same generation as Manchester United's manager, Alex Ferguson, but looks about two decades younger, and fitter. Fergie's managerial career has been without a major blip, yet he now looks puffy, unhealthy. George's managerial nightmare might have driven weaker men to suicide, yet he radiates health and energy, as lean, toned and smooth as he appeared in his playing days. His hair is still Celtic dark. There's a bit of a bald patch at the back, sure, but no need to mention that. Not if I'm hoping to get on to the bung. Graham puts his passion for clothes, and his desire to be always well turned-out, down to the poverty and deprivations of his childhood. He was born in Bargeddie, outside Glasgow, on November 30, 1944, St Andrew's Day. (He shares a birthday with Winston Churchill and Gary Winston Lineker.) His father was a steelworker, who died when George was just three weeks old, leaving his mother to bring up seven children on her own. George has no memory of ever getting any new clothes until he was over 13. He wore hand-me-downs from his older brothers and sisters. George lived for football as a boy, as most footballers do. \"And I never had any doubts I would make it.\" Surely you merely hoped, rather than expected? \"No, I was one of the most talented in my area - played for Lanarkshire, then Scotland Schoolboys - so I was encouraged from the beginning to believe that I would become a professional.\" At 15, he had offers from Aston Villa, Chelsea and Newcastle, went to see them all, inspected their premises, listened to their promises. Plus their extra inducements? \"There were none.\" George stops smiling, suddenly doesn't appear quite so sleek, so charming. He narrows his eyes, knowing only too well what I might be leading up to. But it was normal then, I suggested, and still is, for schoolboy stars to be offered little treats: a free holiday, perhaps, or a new car for their mum and dad; sometimes even a house, as in the case of Paul Gascoigne, or so it was alleged at the time. \"Nothing - I got offered nothing, and I took nothing.\" He joined Villa, mainly because of the fatherly figure of Joe Mercer, whom his mother and older brother, Andy, liked. Then, in 1964, he moved on to Chelsea and, two years later, to Arsenal. It was the Arsenal move that changed his attitudes, to life and football. \"It had been all fun at Chelsea, the swinging 60s, lots of good times, living it up. It was a real jolt coming to Arsenal, because they were much more disciplined. It took me two years to get used to it. I had a lot of knocks at Arsenal.\" Knocks? My memory of George, the Gorgeous Stroller, quick in the mind if not always in foot, is of him being a vital part of the team, one of the team's recognised stars. I tell him I find it strange that he didn't see it that way at the time. \"Oh no. I was very often dropped, though that wasn't always said in public. Bertie Mee often left me out. He'd say I needed a challenge. It had a good effect on me, because that was when I first began to think to myself, 'I'll show them.' \" Which, of course, he did, when all those medals were won. Yet, when the time came for him to retire from football, he never thought of trying to stay in the game. \"I had no confidence, you see.\" Oh, come on, George. I can't think of anyone who exudes more confidence. \"As a player, yes, but at that stage I really had no confidence about being a coach. I had worked under Dave Sexton, Don Howe, Bertie Mee, and I could see that they were brilliant coaches. I could also see that my friend Terry Venables [best man at George's wedding] was going to be a brilliant manager. I knew that I couldn't compete with any of them. They were just so good. Honestly, coaching never entered my head. They were clearly gifted. I wasn't. \"I also had no desire to stay in football. As a player, I wasn't exactly a keen trainer. I was more interested in finishing and going off for a vodka and coke, or chasing the lassies. People I played with, knowing my lifestyle at the time, would never have predicted I'd become a manager. Frank McClintock [Arsenal's captain] still makes jokes about that whenever I meet him. \"George Graham, the footballer, is not the sort of person that George Graham, the manager, would want in his team . . . What I thought I'd do was run a pub. I started working in one owned by Frank. I pulled pints for several months, learned about the cellars, all the skulduggery to look out for. I was planning to buy my own pub when one day I got a call from Terry. \"He had become manager at Crystal Palace. He asked if I'd like to be his youth team coach. I had no coaching certificates, no training, no interest, really, but Terry said he thought I could do it. He said give it a year. If you don't like it, then fine, go off and buy your pub. I learned almost at once, in just a few weeks, that I loved teaching. I'd never been aware of that. So wasn't that lucky? \"So much of life, and football, is luck - if Terry had not rung me when he did, I would not be in football today. When I look at the success David O'Leary has made at Leeds since he took over [O'Leary was assistant manager when Graham left the club - somewhat acrimoniously, it must be said - for Spurs], I think back to the twist of fate that took him there. When I got the Leeds job, after my year out of football, I wanted to take Stewart Houston as my number two. He'd worked with me at Arsenal. But, by then, he'd got a manager's job at QPR, so I didn't offer it to him, though I would have done. Instead, I thought I'd try David, even though he was so young and inexperienced. I'd give him a chance. But even I didn't realise how brilliant he would turn out to be.\" Today, at Spurs, however, George has got Stewart Houston as his number two. Together, they have done a fair job - so far. Spurs won the Worthington Cup last season, and this season they have stuffed Arsenal at White Hart Lane, which cheered up every Spurs fan, and have also beaten Manchester United. On his arrival at Spurs in October 1998, on his first day at training, George got them outside on a grassy bank, all the players and coaching staff, and gave them the George Graham managerial pep talk, along the lines he's given a few times before. Saying what? \"Oh, just to tell them what I believe in.\" Yes, but what exactly? \"I told them, first, how fortunate they were to be in a job that was their living, but also their hobby, their love. I said not many people today can say that. I also pointed out how well rewarded they were, for following their hobby. I said what I look for in all players is technical ability, application, desire, ambition. If they are to stay at this club, then ambition is absolutely vital. I didn't want anyone here for the fun of it, to see out their career, put in a few years. I am here to win things, not have fun. The fun will be in the winning, when it comes. \"Looking around, I said I can see some amazing talent here. But, looking around, I can also see a lot of under-achieving. My job is to put that right. And, together, we'll achieve things.\" Good stuff, George. Let's hope some cheered, or at least puffed out their manly chests. Having delivered the message, he went on to make some immediate changes. \"Mobile phones were banned on the team coach. I ordered blazers to be worn by all the first team on match days.\" Blazers? You mean like back in the dark ages? I remember in the 70s, when I was following Spurs around, blazers were in, but I thought they'd gone, along with crinolines, except for cup finals. \"Oh, but I believe in them. The top Italian and Spanish clubs all wear them and look immaculate. I want footballers to have that sort of image, to be seen as great professionals, just as much as lawyers or doctors.\" On the team coach, on the way to the hotel, he does allow them to wear tracksuits, but once his players leave the hotel, heading for the ground, they must all be in club blazers. \"They're quite subtle, actually, in navy. There's not a proper badge, just a small cockerel. Quite discreet.\" He then imposed a new reign of terror - sorry, strict discipline - on the Tottenham training. Anyone who is even a minute late gets fined. Just a nominal amount, \u00a350, which doubles each time the offence is repeated. As the training ground is surrounded by so many hellish roads where hold-ups are frequent, this makes it rather tough. \"For a first offence, from, say, a new player, it's a warning only. After that, the fines start.\" (The fines, by the way, all go to charity, to Great Ormond Street Hospital. Last season, they received \u00a34,500.) George, you're not going soft in your middle years? \"It's not being petty insisting on punctuality, or wanting to be seen with a big whip - it's a matter of having a sense of professionalism. By turning up late, you are showing lack of respect for me, for the coaching staff, and also for your fellow players, whom you expect just to wait around for you to arrive. I want all players to have respect for other players.\" The treatment room at Spurs had become something of a standing joke for a good few years. Fans, both at Tottenham and around the country, made fun of players who seemed to spend their life there - Darren Anderton, for instance, is still referred to as Sick Note, having played fewer than 100 games in five years (top-flight players might reasonably expect to play at least 50 games a season). \"I have never accused any player of putting on an injury,\" says Graham, \"but what can happen is that the treatment room becomes too comfortable, so they stay too long, having nice massages. When I arrived, I changed the treatment hours - the last session now finishes at 4pm. That's just about the moment when the M25 becomes absolutely hellish. It's surprising how many people now manage to get out of the treatment room well ahead of the rush hour.\" As for changes to the team and tactics, they, too, have been noticeable to all. For the past 20 years, as a Spurs fan, I have had to close my eyes every time the other team got over the halfway line, for fear that our defence would either flap or freeze. We have had some good individuals -such as Hoddle, Waddle and Gazza - over the years, but rarely a solid defence. \"I think that became a psychological crutch for Spurs. During the years when their fans shouted 'boring, boring Arsenal', they comforted themselves by saying, 'Well, we might not win things, but at least we have the better players.' That was just an excuse. The whole team has not been good enough for a long time.\" George has clearly worked on the defence. It's not yet as solid as Arsenal's, but it is a lot better than it was. At Arsenal, he put into his defenders' minds the image of being tied together on the same piece of rope. A neat image. But was it original? \"I got the idea from watching the great Liverpool team. They always moved up and down as one unit, never as individuals, as if tied together. I was trying to explain how they had done it.\" Under George, for example, Stephen Carr, the young Irish fullback, has blossomed, and our goalkeeper, Ian Walker, no longer makes me scream - he used to take forever with his kicks. \"Yes, that was one change I made. It wasn't just a matter of wasting time, but losing the team's momentum.\" David Ginola, our only recognisable heart-stopper in recent years, was expected not to survive under Graham's managership; everyone - press, fans, me - thought that he and his lovely locks [not for nothing is Ginola the face of L'Or\u00e9al] would be on their way, not only for his habit of sometimes fannying around, losing the ball, then putting his hands on his waist and sighing, but also because Graham has a reputation for being unwilling to accommodate flair players. Today, however, Ginola works hard all the time, and last season was voted Player of the Year, both by his fellow professionals and by the football press. This season, he's not been quite as consistent. \"He hasn't been at his best recently, but that happens to all players. Look at Dennis Bergkamp [Arsenal's current star player]. He often has poor spells. It's just not true I don't like creative players. I do. But, in future, I think we'll stop talking about 'creative midfield players'. All players should be all-rounders.\" So I asked about Allan Nielsen, the Danish midfielder, who has not figured in the team much since George arrived, and appears to have been replaced by Steffen Freund, the hard-tackling German. Was George not a fan? \"It's not that. It's just that I didn't want a midfield man who goes forward as much as Allan does. I prefer the men in the middle to stay put, let the fullbacks do the forward attacks. So Allan didn't quite suit my formation. But that might change. And we do need him.\" What Spurs mainly needs, or so all Spurs fans believe, is some decent strikers. \"We probably need up to four new players to achieve success,\" says Graham. \"But, for that, I'll need \u00a320 million.\" So why doesn't Alan Sugar, the club chairman, let you have it? \"Alan Sugar is as keen as I am that I should find strikers, but we both feel that the club should not be held to ransom. Strikers these days cost fortunes. Leeds have been looking for a good one for a year. And they can afford more than I can.\" All the same, he feels that he is ahead of his game-plan. In his first season, his main aim was to avoid relegation; in the event, Tottenham finished safely in mid-table and won a cup. This season, Graham's aim is to finish in the top six, and thereby qualify for a European competition next year. With a third of the season to go, that is still within their reach. After that, it all depends on whether he gets those new players. \"I'm told that, by finishing in the top three, a club can make as much as \u00a340 million. But, of course, you need to invest \u00a320 million to do that. It's like life. You have to speculate to accumulate.\" Which brings us to his own little bit of accumulation. The \"bung\" details are complicated, but, in simple terms, George accepted two lumps of cash, totalling \u00a3425,000, from a Norwegian football agent with whom George, as manager of Arsenal, had been involved in various transfer deals. He had also helped this agent, giving him advice and contacts in British football in general. George, therefore, so he says, looked upon this money as an unsolicited gift. He didn't see it as having strings attached, either before or after. At the time, he didn't appear to see anything wrong at all. Arsenal, the club, didn't lose out. His \"gifts\" had come out of a middleman's pocket. No one, so he maintained, was cheated. Anyway, he lost his job at Arsenal, was banned by the FA from football for a year, but he did hand over all the money, with interest. So he gained nothing in the end. In fact, he lost money - in legal fees, plus around \u00a32 million in loss of earnings. Most of all, he lost a reputation. My reaction at the time, and those of many other fans, was to shrug and put it down to the culture of football, in which footballers have been brought up. As schoolboy stars, they are tempted with brown envelopes (though remember that George never was). As young first-team stars, they get used to free gifts, TV sets, cars. If they get to Wembley, they can make a nice profit selling their ticket allowance - against football's laws, yes, but it's always been done. Then, when they attain real stardom, there can be back-handers on transfers and contracts. That's what I believe, anyway. Then, in the world of management, should they get there, bung allegations have been heard for years at clubs throughout the divisions. In Alex Ferguson's recent book, for example, the Manchester United manager reveals that he once received \u00a340,000 in cash from a Russian agent for no apparent reason, though, sensibly, he shoved it in a safe and later returned it. The point is, most of us assume football has always been awash with readies, since the very first transfers began. \"This is you saying all this,\" replied George, after I had described what I like to think I know about football. \"It's not me saying it.\" Okay, then, do you regret it? \"Of course I do. I was wrong to accept the money. I concede that greed got the better of me. I should not have done it. But, really, is it any different from big business? It's commonplace in the commercial world for such gifts to be given - and received.\" He is clearly still incensed by the part Arsenal played, or didn't play, in the drama. It did look at the time as if the club must have known, or suspected, that such things were going on and, therefore, shared some of the responsibility. When the story first came out, in a newspaper expos\u00e9, George looked as though he would survive the storm. Behind the scenes, so he says, he had made an arrangement with Arsenal to leave quietly at the end of the season with an appropriate compensation. Then, suddenly, on February 21, 1995, he was told to clear his desk and received not a penny. He considers this a total stab in the back. The reasons are still a mystery. What, or who, made Arsenal suddenly change their mind? Did they fear other things coming out, or about other people? We still don't know. \"I don't want to talk about it. I never do, if I can help it. It's in the past. I have to be positive. What I did has made me grow up as a person. I could very well have collapsed. It's how you conduct yourself after such things have happened, that's what matters. I did not run away from it. I faced it, have overcome it, and like to think I am stronger by it.\" In some ways, it has made him a more understanding manager, more aware of the weaknesses of others than he was. Though not by a great deal. The George Graham school of management is still very much based on strong discipline, even a bit of fear. No player would dare give him cheek to his face, or even call him by his first name. Some managers believe that some players need a hug, need cheering up or an arm around their shoulder. Brian Little was good at this - but, in the end, it didn't get him far. There are those who believe star players need an extra bit of attention and leniency, just because, well, they are stars. Ron Atkinson was a bit prone to this. George belongs to neither of these schools. \"Perhaps I have got a bit softer than I was, compared with my Arsenal days. There, I was probably a bit hard on people such as Martin Keown, who can be a bit hyper-sensitive and nervous. I was probably a bit too tough on him at times, put too much pressure on him. I still wouldn't hug a player, but I think I'm more understanding of their feelings than I used to be. My basic belief, however, is still the same. I'm not interested in this idea of pressure. The man in the street has just as many pressures as footballers. I don't sympathise with those players who can't take the strain.\" In a book he wrote in 1995, Glory And The Grief, George laid out 10 commandments for young players, listing the things they should do or follow in order to succeed. I asked if he had some similar rules for managers, now that he's had 20 years in management. He didn't know if he could manage 10, he said, but he'd have a go . . . 1) A manager must lay down at any club that he is the leader, more than the chairman, more than any star player. He must instil his character into the fabric of the whole club. That's what Alex Ferguson has done at Manchester United. I believe that 99% of people prefer to be led. Only 1% are leaders. 2) I'm not against some players earning more than others, but once they come through my door they are all equal, and get treated equally, no matter who they are or what they have done. I don't make allowances for anyone. I make my rules clear, and everyone has to obey them. 3) A manager has to be a bit of a psychologist. This takes time to acquire, comes with experience, knowing how to handle players, but I've also learned by reading about it, especially American books on sports psychology. 4) A manager also has to be a bit of an actor. It's not a matter of lying - just not giving the whole truth. You can't tell the press, TV and radio what's really going on. Nor, sometimes, the players. You need a bit of acting when handling them. With the media, in my Arsenal days, I was deliberately not very media-friendly. Now, I like to think I'm more approachable. 5) A manager must not want to be popular. A manager has to expect to be disliked. You must realise every decision will upset someone. I have never gone through my management life wanting to be liked. Being disliked doesn't bother me. Not bad, George, for straight off, but then, he is a very clever manager, and very fluent. He also had quite a bit of time to think about the arts of management during his enforced year out of the game, during those moments when he wasn't cultivating his garden. In fact, once I'd got him started, he could hardly stop. The teacher in him was just clamouring to come out. \"There are basically three types of managers,\" he continued. \"There's the training-ground manager, who likes to take a group of players and work on them until they have improved. There's the cheque-book manager, who builds teams by going out and buying players - it does take skill to do this, as a cheque will never guarantee success. Then there's the media manager, who is on TV and radio all the time, who is publicity-friendly and good at PR.\" So which are you George? \"The first type, of course. I leave you to put names to the other types.\" Apart from football management, and the theory thereof, George is also interested in football history. At Christie's in Glasgow in 1989, during the first sale of football memorabilia by a leading auction house, he bid for Alex James's 1930 Arsenal FA Cup Final medal, which was estimated at \u00a31,000. George bid \u00a31,500. It went for \u00a35,000. He has successfully bought other stuff, mainly of Arsenal interest: he has 18 out of a set of 30 Arsenal cartoon postcards from 1904. \"I think the only complete set in existence is in Woolwich Library.\" He's also proud of his programme for the match between Arsenal and Leicester Fosse in 1913. \"It's in mint condition and, of course, very significant.\" How come? \"It was Arsenal's first game at Highbury. Didn't you know that? I thought you were a collector. Arsenal won 2-1.\" I collect Spurs memorabilia, which he does not appear to be into so far, which surprised me. Bit of an insult to Spurs? \"No, it's not. I just haven't had time. Anyway, most of my Arsenal stuff is packed away.\" He has also kept some Arsenal shares, which he bought when he was at the club, as an investment. \"I'm keeping them because they should go up more, once the plans are announced for their new stadium. It will hold a lot more people, so that will make the club and the shares more valuable.\" He has some share options at Spurs, as part of his contract, but has so far not taken them. Not a bad judge, obviously: my own Spurs shares cost \u00a31 each when I bought them, and they were about 60p last time I looked. \"Davor Suker of Arsenal has bought shares in Man Utd, which is interesting. Perhaps, in future, clubs might offer shares to foreign players when they come here. It could be an extra inducement for them to play well, and, therefore, share in the success. It hasn't happened, as far as I know. Just an idea.\" What about the Arsenal's coat of arms that was rumoured to have been set into the patio of his Hampstead apartment? It was a particularly heated talking point among Spurs fans when he first arrived. \"That's just a myth. It never happened. Anyway, I don't live in that apartment any more.\" He recently moved into a new house, still in Hampstead, with his new American wife, Susan, whom he has known for six years. She was married before and has four children. George's first marriage, alas, collapsed some years ago, but he remains very close to his two children, Nicole, 31, an ardent football fan who went to all his Arsenal games, and those at Leeds, and who now passionately follows Spurs; and Daniel, 26, who is not interested in football - he prefers golf. Both went to school at Dame Alice Owen's in Potters Bar. Nicole went to Homerton College in Cambridge, and became a schoolteacher. She is currently a full-time wife and mother to 14-month old Mark, George's first grandchild. George has said that Arsenal ruined his first marriage: as a player, he explains, you have half of every day free and can be home at one o'clock; as a manager, you can't. At Arsenal, he was hardly ever at home, working and travelling all hours. Eventually his wife, so it was reported, went off with a drycleaner, which gave the tabloids a good excuse for a headline: \"George gets taken to the cleaners.\" Yes, Arsenal has a lot to answer for . . .",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Spring is an amorous season, which is why the feast of St Valentine anticipates its onset by a few weeks, as if to rouse our sensibilities from hibernation. Romance perfumes the air; flowers appear for the express purpose of being bunched into lovers' tributes; chocolate manufacturers count their profits. </p> <p>Yet despite appearances, the kinds of love that are most significant to us are not those that fill novels and cinema screens. They are instead those we have for family, friends and comrades; for these are the loves that endure through the greater part of our lives, and give us our sense of self-worth, our stability, and the framework for our other relationships. Romantic love, by contrast, is an episodic, usually short-lived, and often vivid turbulence in our emotional histories.</p> <p> To judge by the attention it receives, not least in poetry and song - our parliaments for discussing the heart's essentials - it is one of life's profoundest experiences. Yet, paradoxically, the official line is that, apart from a few experimental feints in early adulthood, its true heights should only be experienced once, with lifelong bonding as the appropriate outcome. Anyone who claims to fall in love frequently is deemed irresponsible, and with some justification: for it is such a time-consuming, exhausting, ecstatic, painful, transforming business that it requires a long recovery - in some cases, indeed, whole lifetimes. </p> <p> Sober folk claim that falling romantically in love is not a good way to get to know someone, for Stendhal's reason that we cloak the beloved in layers of crystal, and see a vision rather than a person for the whole period of our entrancement. On this view it is a delusional state, and the fact that it is short-lived is therefore good. Others think that romantic love is the only thing that allows us to burn through the layers that conventionally insulate people from one another, baring the soul of each to each, and making true communication possible - the kind that speaks the language of intimacy, not in words but in pleasures and desires. This is far from the only difference of opinion about romantic love.</p> <p> Another debate rages over the question whether a propensity for romance is an essential human trait, or whether it is a social and historical construction, present in some periods and societies but absent from others. As this crucial question shows, romantic love is a scarcely understood phenomenon, not least because in modern times we have conflated it with features and expectations drawn from other kinds of love, which latter we have ceased to reflect upon, as if their naturalness exempted them from consideration. The Greeks had different words for love's different manifestations. </p> <p>They spoke of agape , altruistic love (in Latin caritas, which gives us - but with what a cold ring - our word charity). They spoke of ludus , the playful affection of children and of casual lovers, and pragma , the understanding that exists between a long established married couple. They spoke of storge , the love that grows between siblings or comrades in arms who have been through much together, and of mania , which is obsession. And they allied the latter with eros or sexual passion.</p> <p> They thought that love in all its forms was divinely inspired, in the case of the last by Aphrodite. But divine inspiration was not always welcome; manic eroticism, they said, was often inflicted as a punishment by the gods, and its unreasoning and distracting character interfered with what they most valued, namely intellect and courage. Both Plato and his pupil Aristotle, in their different ways, placed friendship at the summit of emotional life, and consigned the love that craves bodily expression to a lower plane.</p> <p> For many Greeks, ataraxia, or peace of mind, was a great good that was always under threat from sexual love and its obsessions and jealousies, and that is why Sophocles applauded old age for releasing mankind from what he called the tyranny of sexual desire. In making these distinctions the Greeks showed an alertness to the fact that close relationships subserve a variety of ends. People need emotional satisfactions of many kinds, but chiefly those that stem from giving and receiving companionship, affection, and the affirmations of being liked and approved. People might occasionally enjoy solitude, but never loneliness; they need to feel connected and valued.</p> <p> All of the six loves of the Greeks are connections, and all but mania bring a sense of self-worth. In the Greek ideal, the best and strongest emotional bonds are those of friendship between equals. Romantic and erotic passion might be felt by a man for a boy or (not quite as acceptably) a woman, but this was a distraction, and too much of it was regarded as weakness. </p> <p> The downgrading of relations with women had a long and unhappy influence in the west. In the Christian era - despite what is suggested by the medieval side-show of courtly love as celebrated by troubadours - most marriages were economic and practical arrangements, with disparity in age, education and status making companionate marriage rare. It remained so until recent times: Thomas Hardy remarked that the reason men and women were unable to establish a genuine camaraderie even in his own day was that they associated with each other only in their pleasures, never in their labours. </p> <p> In saying this, Hardy presaged a new ideal of love as a combination of romance and comradeship. This was something really novel in western civilisation. Both romance and friendship have always been ideals, but quite separately; and romance has taken very different forms at different times in history. Romantic-companionate love as we now view it received its definitive statement very recently - at the hands of Hollywood in its golden age, between the 30s and 50s, in thousands of films. Of course, progress towards the acculturation of its ideals and norms had already begun, in 19th century literature, which established the now-familiar pattern: a couple fall romantically in love, and therefore commit themselves to an open-ended venture of exclusive cohabitation (marriage, or in more recent times its surrogates) with children in the garden and roses round the door. </p> <p> The standard denouement for a Victorian three-volume novel is the engagement of the hero and heroine in the last chapter. In Jane Austen, earlier in the century, this terminus is reached by more reflective and sober means; not with high passion, not even with palpitations and breathlessness, save for a faint simulacrum of these in an early phase of each novel's development, to show that Elizabeth is not indifferent to Darcy. </p> <p>The courtship of Emma and Mr Knightley is quintessential Austen: a matter of mind and morals, of character and decision. Not so by the time of Hardy. Love here takes the form either of mania or mature sexual passion. In Hardy's prophecy of the newly emerging pattern, romance is not an end in itself but a step towards love of the other kinds - it becomes the porch to friendship, comradeship, the equal or near-equal partnership in life's adventure.</p> <p> \"When I look up, there you'll be, and when you look up, there I'll be,\" says Gabriel Oak to Bathsheba Everdene, in a summary that would have curdled the passion of a medieval troubadour for whom romance was all in all, and domesticity its nemesis. In opposition to the view that romantic love was invented by the troubadours, some argue that it is a universal phenomenon. To claim this is to take sides in the debate between essentialists and constructionists. The constructionists claim that romantic love is one of the four great, intrinsic, inescapable upheavals which define the human condition (the others are: being born, having children, and dying). </p> <p>The latter claim that although loving, in all its variety of objects and modes, is one of the central human emotions, how it is expressed is an historically determined matter. Both are right; for people have always fallen in love - which is to say become infatuated, desirous, obsessed in some degree; usually enough to lose sleep and to forget mundane tasks - but its expression of that state, and the other forms of love it has been allied to, and the expectations nurtured by the parties to it, have been very variously conceived. </p> <p>A Greek of classical antiquity might become passionate about a boy, but sex was not the only point, for the lover's task was to educate his beloved in military and political ways, and help him in the early part of his career. In the love stories told by Plutarch the point was to illustrate the destructiveness of sexual mania - showing how the girl Aristocleia, or the boy Actaeon, were physically torn apart by competing suitors trying to snatch them away. Shakespeare's lovers are also sexually manic; they can scarcely restrain themselves before a priest is found.</p> <p> Fielding and Richardson divide between them the uproarious tumble in the hay and the unremittingly-threatened rape. Only with the increased education of women does the idea of a com panionable love-life after erotic mania - indeed, initiated by it - come into focus, bringing other models to mind. Some are, once again, drawn from our earliest literature, as with Hector bidding his last farewell to Andromache - a scene touchingly drawn by Homer, who says the hero had to remove his helmet because its nodding plumes frightened his small children as they clustered round Andromache's feet. </p> <p>Another example is the marriage of Penelope and Odysseus, the pattern of sustained fidelity, storge and pragma . Modern sensibility took these comradely marriages and added them to romantic infatuation as its proper sequel, and a kind of emotional economy was born: the passion, the friendship, the companionship, the partnership, the nurturing and the needing, once offered by different relationships, could now come in a single handy package marked Spouse. But the modern combination of romance and comradeship which is now our ideal often proves an unstable mixture. </p> <p>The obsessive character of romantic and erotic love cannot be understood without reference to sex, nor sex without reference to gender. Sex is about genitals and genital activity, gender is about social and psychological categories; their failure to pair neatly is a fruitful source of trouble. Companionate love does not exclude sexual love, but its premises and aims are very different. It is about the shared project of what is in effect a small business, purchasing and budgeting and managing other (usually small) people, and transporting and storing things, saving and spending, and dealing with problems, like illnesses and burst pipes. </p> <p>Gender differences, shaped and enhanced by social pressures, were thought to provide an apt division of labour for these tasks, but that division, and even the gender differences themselves, have in recent years been bitterly questioned, not least because - against feminist hopes and principles - science seems to suggest that in the competition between nature and nurture, the former has an insistent and irreducible role in determining sexual behaviour and gender characteristics. </p> <p>Irenic feminists say that this does not imply strict determinism: as rational beings we can adjust biology in the direction of justice, as we do when we control our aggression and selfishness. But others accuse science of bias, saying that it tries to conceal behind statistics an historical conspiracy against women. There is a measure of truth on both sides.</p> <p> On one crucial point, gender determinism has seemed to some men to explain a major source of trouble in monogamy. It is, they claim, that heterosexual relationships have always been shaped in the interests of women, who control and ration the amount of sex in them. If this is true, it would be natural enough; women have to be mindful of the fact that, in the form of pregnancy and childbirth, their potential investment in sex is far greater than a man's.</p> <p> We forget that safe and effective contraception is a very recent amenity; and old habits and needs die hard. It is for this reason, perhaps, that prostitution has been such an effective and long-standing friend to marriage, despite the hypocrisy that has usually surrounded it. </p> <p> One measure of the generally unsuccessful nature of modern romantic-companionate love is the high rate at which the relationships based upon it fail. Divorce in the contemporary west runs at 40% - for unmarried couples the rate is higher - and many of the marriages that survive do so at a high cost of compromise by one or both partners. </p> <p>Blame is variously assigned, often to causes that come down to maleness. Some writers extrapolate from Freudian theory the view that men suffer a psychological wound caused by separation from their mothers and their inability (in some writers, notably Sheila Sullivan in Falling In Love: A History of Torment and Enchantment [Books, page 11] their \"humiliating inability\") to give birth and suckle. </p> <p>They claim that this wound explains everything women deprecate in men, chiefly emotional immaturity, lack of communication about feelings, proneness to infidelity, latent or active misogyny, and - at the extreme - aggression. They cite these as what derails the project of equal romantic comradeship. Even without its dubious Freudian underpinning, this is improbable stuff, and no man will recognise what has been called \"the harsh anomie of masculine existence\" as accounting for his behaviour in relationships. The problem, more plausibly, lies elsewhere: in society's endeavours to manage, constrain, deny, re-route, prohibit, channel and manipulate sexual passion and romantic love. </p> <p>The dead hand of oppressive institutions - principally religions - explains why love can be a problem: which it only is when rationed and starved, as it is in the \"family values\" dispensation of monogamy and restrictive attitudes to sexual expression and variety. When rationed and starved, eros becomes destructive, prompting the moralisers, in their wisdom, to ration and starve it more. And thereby hangs many a long tale, as novels and films in their thousands show.</p> <p> If the modern experiment of romantic-companionate love is to succeed, it has to be freed from the institutional arrangements made centuries ago for a quite different kind of relationship - the practical-economic model of Christian monogamy - in which neither romance nor companionship was the most important thing. It is both a pun and a truth to say that the subject of love has always been left to amateurs to explain. There is no science of love because it is too various and protean to fit a theory. People attempt love as climbers attempt Everest; they scramble along, and end by camping in the foothills, or half way up, wherever their compromises leave them. </p> <p>Some get high enough to see the view, which we know is magnificent, for we have all glimpsed it in dreams. And that is what the feast of St Valentine is about: the dream of love. Life would be bitter if the dream never became reality, or if the main experiences of love in our lives - storge , pragma , ludus , agape - were not enduring and stabilising enough to save us when the storms of eros and mania sweep by, leaving bliss and havoc in their wake. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Spring is an amorous season, which is why the feast of St Valentine anticipates its onset by a few weeks, as if to rouse our sensibilities from hibernation. Romance perfumes the air; flowers appear for the express purpose of being bunched into lovers' tributes; chocolate manufacturers count their profits. Yet despite appearances, the kinds of love that are most significant to us are not those that fill novels and cinema screens. They are instead those we have for family, friends and comrades; for these are the loves that endure through the greater part of our lives, and give us our sense of self-worth, our stability, and the framework for our other relationships. Romantic love, by contrast, is an episodic, usually short-lived, and often vivid turbulence in our emotional histories. To judge by the attention it receives, not least in poetry and song - our parliaments for discussing the heart's essentials - it is one of life's profoundest experiences. Yet, paradoxically, the official line is that, apart from a few experimental feints in early adulthood, its true heights should only be experienced once, with lifelong bonding as the appropriate outcome. Anyone who claims to fall in love frequently is deemed irresponsible, and with some justification: for it is such a time-consuming, exhausting, ecstatic, painful, transforming business that it requires a long recovery - in some cases, indeed, whole lifetimes. Sober folk claim that falling romantically in love is not a good way to get to know someone, for Stendhal's reason that we cloak the beloved in layers of crystal, and see a vision rather than a person for the whole period of our entrancement. On this view it is a delusional state, and the fact that it is short-lived is therefore good. Others think that romantic love is the only thing that allows us to burn through the layers that conventionally insulate people from one another, baring the soul of each to each, and making true communication possible - the kind that speaks the language of intimacy, not in words but in pleasures and desires. This is far from the only difference of opinion about romantic love. Another debate rages over the question whether a propensity for romance is an essential human trait, or whether it is a social and historical construction, present in some periods and societies but absent from others. As this crucial question shows, romantic love is a scarcely understood phenomenon, not least because in modern times we have conflated it with features and expectations drawn from other kinds of love, which latter we have ceased to reflect upon, as if their naturalness exempted them from consideration. The Greeks had different words for love's different manifestations. They spoke of agape , altruistic love (in Latin caritas, which gives us - but with what a cold ring - our word charity). They spoke of ludus , the playful affection of children and of casual lovers, and pragma , the understanding that exists between a long established married couple. They spoke of storge , the love that grows between siblings or comrades in arms who have been through much together, and of mania , which is obsession. And they allied the latter with eros or sexual passion. They thought that love in all its forms was divinely inspired, in the case of the last by Aphrodite. But divine inspiration was not always welcome; manic eroticism, they said, was often inflicted as a punishment by the gods, and its unreasoning and distracting character interfered with what they most valued, namely intellect and courage. Both Plato and his pupil Aristotle, in their different ways, placed friendship at the summit of emotional life, and consigned the love that craves bodily expression to a lower plane. For many Greeks, ataraxia, or peace of mind, was a great good that was always under threat from sexual love and its obsessions and jealousies, and that is why Sophocles applauded old age for releasing mankind from what he called the tyranny of sexual desire. In making these distinctions the Greeks showed an alertness to the fact that close relationships subserve a variety of ends. People need emotional satisfactions of many kinds, but chiefly those that stem from giving and receiving companionship, affection, and the affirmations of being liked and approved. People might occasionally enjoy solitude, but never loneliness; they need to feel connected and valued. All of the six loves of the Greeks are connections, and all but mania bring a sense of self-worth. In the Greek ideal, the best and strongest emotional bonds are those of friendship between equals. Romantic and erotic passion might be felt by a man for a boy or (not quite as acceptably) a woman, but this was a distraction, and too much of it was regarded as weakness. The downgrading of relations with women had a long and unhappy influence in the west. In the Christian era - despite what is suggested by the medieval side-show of courtly love as celebrated by troubadours - most marriages were economic and practical arrangements, with disparity in age, education and status making companionate marriage rare. It remained so until recent times: Thomas Hardy remarked that the reason men and women were unable to establish a genuine camaraderie even in his own day was that they associated with each other only in their pleasures, never in their labours. In saying this, Hardy presaged a new ideal of love as a combination of romance and comradeship. This was something really novel in western civilisation. Both romance and friendship have always been ideals, but quite separately; and romance has taken very different forms at different times in history. Romantic-companionate love as we now view it received its definitive statement very recently - at the hands of Hollywood in its golden age, between the 30s and 50s, in thousands of films. Of course, progress towards the acculturation of its ideals and norms had already begun, in 19th century literature, which established the now-familiar pattern: a couple fall romantically in love, and therefore commit themselves to an open-ended venture of exclusive cohabitation (marriage, or in more recent times its surrogates) with children in the garden and roses round the door. The standard denouement for a Victorian three-volume novel is the engagement of the hero and heroine in the last chapter. In Jane Austen, earlier in the century, this terminus is reached by more reflective and sober means; not with high passion, not even with palpitations and breathlessness, save for a faint simulacrum of these in an early phase of each novel's development, to show that Elizabeth is not indifferent to Darcy. The courtship of Emma and Mr Knightley is quintessential Austen: a matter of mind and morals, of character and decision. Not so by the time of Hardy. Love here takes the form either of mania or mature sexual passion. In Hardy's prophecy of the newly emerging pattern, romance is not an end in itself but a step towards love of the other kinds - it becomes the porch to friendship, comradeship, the equal or near-equal partnership in life's adventure. \"When I look up, there you'll be, and when you look up, there I'll be,\" says Gabriel Oak to Bathsheba Everdene, in a summary that would have curdled the passion of a medieval troubadour for whom romance was all in all, and domesticity its nemesis. In opposition to the view that romantic love was invented by the troubadours, some argue that it is a universal phenomenon. To claim this is to take sides in the debate between essentialists and constructionists. The constructionists claim that romantic love is one of the four great, intrinsic, inescapable upheavals which define the human condition (the others are: being born, having children, and dying). The latter claim that although loving, in all its variety of objects and modes, is one of the central human emotions, how it is expressed is an historically determined matter. Both are right; for people have always fallen in love - which is to say become infatuated, desirous, obsessed in some degree; usually enough to lose sleep and to forget mundane tasks - but its expression of that state, and the other forms of love it has been allied to, and the expectations nurtured by the parties to it, have been very variously conceived. A Greek of classical antiquity might become passionate about a boy, but sex was not the only point, for the lover's task was to educate his beloved in military and political ways, and help him in the early part of his career. In the love stories told by Plutarch the point was to illustrate the destructiveness of sexual mania - showing how the girl Aristocleia, or the boy Actaeon, were physically torn apart by competing suitors trying to snatch them away. Shakespeare's lovers are also sexually manic; they can scarcely restrain themselves before a priest is found. Fielding and Richardson divide between them the uproarious tumble in the hay and the unremittingly-threatened rape. Only with the increased education of women does the idea of a com panionable love-life after erotic mania - indeed, initiated by it - come into focus, bringing other models to mind. Some are, once again, drawn from our earliest literature, as with Hector bidding his last farewell to Andromache - a scene touchingly drawn by Homer, who says the hero had to remove his helmet because its nodding plumes frightened his small children as they clustered round Andromache's feet. Another example is the marriage of Penelope and Odysseus, the pattern of sustained fidelity, storge and pragma . Modern sensibility took these comradely marriages and added them to romantic infatuation as its proper sequel, and a kind of emotional economy was born: the passion, the friendship, the companionship, the partnership, the nurturing and the needing, once offered by different relationships, could now come in a single handy package marked Spouse. But the modern combination of romance and comradeship which is now our ideal often proves an unstable mixture. The obsessive character of romantic and erotic love cannot be understood without reference to sex, nor sex without reference to gender. Sex is about genitals and genital activity, gender is about social and psychological categories; their failure to pair neatly is a fruitful source of trouble. Companionate love does not exclude sexual love, but its premises and aims are very different. It is about the shared project of what is in effect a small business, purchasing and budgeting and managing other (usually small) people, and transporting and storing things, saving and spending, and dealing with problems, like illnesses and burst pipes. Gender differences, shaped and enhanced by social pressures, were thought to provide an apt division of labour for these tasks, but that division, and even the gender differences themselves, have in recent years been bitterly questioned, not least because - against feminist hopes and principles - science seems to suggest that in the competition between nature and nurture, the former has an insistent and irreducible role in determining sexual behaviour and gender characteristics. Irenic feminists say that this does not imply strict determinism: as rational beings we can adjust biology in the direction of justice, as we do when we control our aggression and selfishness. But others accuse science of bias, saying that it tries to conceal behind statistics an historical conspiracy against women. There is a measure of truth on both sides. On one crucial point, gender determinism has seemed to some men to explain a major source of trouble in monogamy. It is, they claim, that heterosexual relationships have always been shaped in the interests of women, who control and ration the amount of sex in them. If this is true, it would be natural enough; women have to be mindful of the fact that, in the form of pregnancy and childbirth, their potential investment in sex is far greater than a man's. We forget that safe and effective contraception is a very recent amenity; and old habits and needs die hard. It is for this reason, perhaps, that prostitution has been such an effective and long-standing friend to marriage, despite the hypocrisy that has usually surrounded it. One measure of the generally unsuccessful nature of modern romantic-companionate love is the high rate at which the relationships based upon it fail. Divorce in the contemporary west runs at 40% - for unmarried couples the rate is higher - and many of the marriages that survive do so at a high cost of compromise by one or both partners. Blame is variously assigned, often to causes that come down to maleness. Some writers extrapolate from Freudian theory the view that men suffer a psychological wound caused by separation from their mothers and their inability (in some writers, notably Sheila Sullivan in Falling In Love: A History of Torment and Enchantment [Books, page 11] their \"humiliating inability\") to give birth and suckle. They claim that this wound explains everything women deprecate in men, chiefly emotional immaturity, lack of communication about feelings, proneness to infidelity, latent or active misogyny, and - at the extreme - aggression. They cite these as what derails the project of equal romantic comradeship. Even without its dubious Freudian underpinning, this is improbable stuff, and no man will recognise what has been called \"the harsh anomie of masculine existence\" as accounting for his behaviour in relationships. The problem, more plausibly, lies elsewhere: in society's endeavours to manage, constrain, deny, re-route, prohibit, channel and manipulate sexual passion and romantic love. The dead hand of oppressive institutions - principally religions - explains why love can be a problem: which it only is when rationed and starved, as it is in the \"family values\" dispensation of monogamy and restrictive attitudes to sexual expression and variety. When rationed and starved, eros becomes destructive, prompting the moralisers, in their wisdom, to ration and starve it more. And thereby hangs many a long tale, as novels and films in their thousands show. If the modern experiment of romantic-companionate love is to succeed, it has to be freed from the institutional arrangements made centuries ago for a quite different kind of relationship - the practical-economic model of Christian monogamy - in which neither romance nor companionship was the most important thing. It is both a pun and a truth to say that the subject of love has always been left to amateurs to explain. There is no science of love because it is too various and protean to fit a theory. People attempt love as climbers attempt Everest; they scramble along, and end by camping in the foothills, or half way up, wherever their compromises leave them. Some get high enough to see the view, which we know is magnificent, for we have all glimpsed it in dreams. And that is what the feast of St Valentine is about: the dream of love. Life would be bitter if the dream never became reality, or if the main experiences of love in our lives - storge , pragma , ludus , agape - were not enduring and stabilising enough to save us when the storms of eros and mania sweep by, leaving bliss and havoc in their wake.",

      "body": "<p>Alan Ayckbourn has always been obsessed by machines. In Henceforward he created an avant-garde composer living in a hi-tech bunker and striving to create the sound of love without understanding it. In Comic Potential he posits a future in which soaps are acted by programmed androids. And now in Virtual Reality, which has just opened at Scarborough's Stephen Joseph Theatre before going on a national tour, he gives us a hero who is hopeless at life but capable of designing virtual exteriors complete with seemingly real people. </p> <p>The play, which I liked very much, brings out two qualities little noticed in Ayckbourn: ambivalence and melancholy. If the play were simply a Luddite attack on an over-mechanised society, it would be wanly predictable: the trick is that the hero, Alex Huby, spends his life doing exactly what playwrights do, which is to create artificial worlds indistinguishable from reality. But the play also reminds us that in the theatre, from Shakespeare to Moli\u00e8re and Chekhov, there is no true comedy without sadness. As Peter Hall wrote to Ayckbourn, at the time of his 60th birthday, \"without the persistent strain of melancholy you might be thought just a brilliant boulevard dramatist.\" </p> <p>The striking thing about Virtual Reality - Ayckbourn's 56th play - is that it contains no great farcical set-pieces. He is content to let the comedy take its course while observing life with a wistful sadness. Indeed his hero, Alex, is almost Russian in his detached neutrality. While designing virtual landscapes he seems only marginally connected to his TV-presenter wife, who spends much of her life on a hands-free mobile phone, and to his closeted, gadget-freak son. When he meets an emotionally fraught young actress, who is doing casual work as the waitress from hell, he drifts into an affair with her almost because it would be impolite not to. In so doing, he brings a network of relationships crashing down like a house of cards. </p> <p>In one sense, Alex is simply the latest in a long line of Ayckbourn heroes who cause mayhem through their moral inertia. Colin, the recently bereaved protagonist of Absent Friends, destroys a whole group of sympathetic chums with his cheerfully vacuous smile. Guy, who joins the local amateur operatic society in A Chorus of Disapproval, is the innocent nonentity who wreaks social and sexual havoc by his simple inability to say no. But Alex is somewhat different in that he sees his own flaws as symptoms of a wider malaise. He tells his half-listening wife: \"We rely on each other for our identity these days, don't we? To tell us what our place is in the world, as it were. Most of us, we don't have a church, we don't have a God, we don't even have a clearly defined code of ethics. Let's face it, we have no real sense of self at all.\" </p> <p>This seems to me Ayckbourn's real theme: not just the emotional isolation induced by the new technology but the problems of living in a moral vacuum. Without a bedrock of belief, religious or political, and with family life under increasing strain, who are we and how on earth do we learn how to live? Because Ayckbourn's plays are set in middle-class worlds, he is often dumbly treated as if he were a conventional writer.

      "bodyText": "Alan Ayckbourn has always been obsessed by machines. In Henceforward he created an avant-garde composer living in a hi-tech bunker and striving to create the sound of love without understanding it. In Comic Potential he posits a future in which soaps are acted by programmed androids. And now in Virtual Reality, which has just opened at Scarborough's Stephen Joseph Theatre before going on a national tour, he gives us a hero who is hopeless at life but capable of designing virtual exteriors complete with seemingly real people. The play, which I liked very much, brings out two qualities little noticed in Ayckbourn: ambivalence and melancholy. If the play were simply a Luddite attack on an over-mechanised society, it would be wanly predictable: the trick is that the hero, Alex Huby, spends his life doing exactly what playwrights do, which is to create artificial worlds indistinguishable from reality. But the play also reminds us that in the theatre, from Shakespeare to Moli\u00e8re and Chekhov, there is no true comedy without sadness. As Peter Hall wrote to Ayckbourn, at the time of his 60th birthday, \"without the persistent strain of melancholy you might be thought just a brilliant boulevard dramatist.\" The striking thing about Virtual Reality - Ayckbourn's 56th play - is that it contains no great farcical set-pieces. He is content to let the comedy take its course while observing life with a wistful sadness. Indeed his hero, Alex, is almost Russian in his detached neutrality. While designing virtual landscapes he seems only marginally connected to his TV-presenter wife, who spends much of her life on a hands-free mobile phone, and to his closeted, gadget-freak son. When he meets an emotionally fraught young actress, who is doing casual work as the waitress from hell, he drifts into an affair with her almost because it would be impolite not to. In so doing, he brings a network of relationships crashing down like a house of cards. In one sense, Alex is simply the latest in a long line of Ayckbourn heroes who cause mayhem through their moral inertia. Colin, the recently bereaved protagonist of Absent Friends, destroys a whole group of sympathetic chums with his cheerfully vacuous smile. Guy, who joins the local amateur operatic society in A Chorus of Disapproval, is the innocent nonentity who wreaks social and sexual havoc by his simple inability to say no. But Alex is somewhat different in that he sees his own flaws as symptoms of a wider malaise. He tells his half-listening wife: \"We rely on each other for our identity these days, don't we? To tell us what our place is in the world, as it were. Most of us, we don't have a church, we don't have a God, we don't even have a clearly defined code of ethics. Let's face it, we have no real sense of self at all.\" This seems to me Ayckbourn's real theme: not just the emotional isolation induced by the new technology but the problems of living in a moral vacuum. Without a bedrock of belief, religious or political, and with family life under increasing strain, who are we and how on earth do we learn how to live? Because Ayckbourn's plays are set in middle-class worlds, he is often dumbly treated as if he were a conventional writer. In fact, the questions he poses are precisely those that have resounded through all the intelligent new writing of the past decade. Allowing for dif ferences of generational perspective and dramatic means, Ayckbourn is at one with David Hare, Patrick Marber, Sarah Kane and Mark Ravenhill in using theatre as a form of inquiry into how you inhabit a moral void. He is not the Grand Old Man of Scarborough: he is as restlessly inquisitive as any dramatist of the new generation. If there is a flaw in the play it is that Alex's negligent adultery leads too easily to the unravelling of all the dependent relationships: it is treated as a given rather than as something to be worked through.

      "bodyText": "Such emotions as guilt, shame and pride usually have oneself as their object, or things one closely identifies with, such as family or (for patriots) country. They are obviously self-referential feelings. Such emotions as love, hatred, contempt and pity, which are directed outwards, towards other people or things, appear not to be self-referential at first, but in an indirect way they are. The reason is that most emotions involve beliefs: if you are ashamed, you believe that you have done something that deserves the contempt of others; if you feel pity, you believe that the object of your compassion is suffering in a way that merits your concern. In both cases you remain in the equation, as a point of reference, and as the sensibility stirred by the beliefs in question. This is especially true of hatred, which is dislike and antipathy inflamed to a high degree and inspired by beliefs which stimulate a set of other emotions in the hater, chief among them fear, ignorance, jealousy, anger and disgust. But note that all these emotions, and especially the first three, are about the hater; thus hating says more about haters than what they hate.

When one dislikes a person on good grounds - because he is provenly dishonest, malevolent, or treacherous, say - the appropriate reaction is disdain, and a withholding of social courtesies. Someone truly contemptible does not merit the energy that stronger emotions require. And as La Rochefoucauld observed, \"When our hatred is too keen it puts us below those we hate,\" which is an allied point. The dinosaurs and moralists who would retain Section 28, and who seek to impose on everyone else their own timid conception of morality in the form of the historically recent and painfully failed \"family values\" ethos beloved by bishops and other old maids - among them the secretary of state for educa tion, who wishes lifelong monogamy to be preached in schools - are in a fair way to being haters of anyone who thinks that it is a simple, humane good that sexual expression and orientation should be matters of private liberty. Certainly the ingredients are there: fear of sex and those who enjoy it outside the limits of marriage's socially sanctioned repetitions, ignorance about homosexual experience, jealousy of the freedom that ensues upon frankness and acceptance of human variety, disgust and anger: these are the ingredients of hate, which, when wrapped in the pious rhetoric of Church and Establishment, breed repression, illiberality, and narrowness.

His third film, Heaven Fell That Night (1958), reunited him with Bardot, although by then they were divorced. A tale of fatal passion and smuggling across the Franco-Spanish border, it displayed the hallmarks of Vadim\u2019s direction - his use of wide screen and glossy presentation of landscape - and brought to a high pitch of intensity Bardot\u2019s combination of waywardness and vulnerability.</p> <p>Subsequently, Vadim became involved with Annette Stroyberg, his wife from 1958 until 1961. He won for her a subsidiary role in his most prestigious undertaking (so much so that the film was to appear on the curriculum of US universities): a modern dress version of Laclos\u2019s novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses (1959), starring Jeanne Moreau and G\u00e9rard Phillipe and made with monochrome austerity.</p> <p>His next inamorata was Catherine Deneuve, then less well-known than she would become.

The Cardiff West MP, 60, was unanimously elected leader of the Welsh Labour party at a special meeting of the party's executive and assembly members in Cardiff yesterday afternoon, two days after the shock resignation of his predecessor, Alun Michael. Opposition parties have indicated they will not oppose his nomination as first secretary when the assembly meets next Tuesday. Mr Morgan seized the opportunity presented by his sudden elevation to start healing the wounds caused by Downing Street's determination to install Mr Michael in the post following the downfall of Ron Davies. Resentment among many traditional voters at the way Mr Morgan was defeated in the second leadership contest cost Labour dear at the assembly elections and indirectly cost Mr Michael his job by leaving the party as a minority administration. Mr Morgan yesterday paid tribute to his predecessor's hard work and to the grace and dignity with which he had left the stage \"under such unfair circumstances\". And in a speech setting out his vision for devolution, he pledged himself to start rebuilding the bond of trust between the party and the people in its traditional heartlands. \"Labour's leader in the assembly is not there to be a thorn in the side of the UK Labour leader, but not to be a puppet either,\" Mr Morgan declared. \"Devolution must mean what it says, a defined transfer of power to Wales. Labour's leader in the assembly must try to embody the aspirations of ordinary Labour voters and members in Wales, and not be the tool of machine politics. \"Never again do I want to appear on an election broadcast to explain why Labour has lost the Rhondda, or Islwyn or Llanelli. That is why I want to see the Labour party in Wales embrace devolution and democracy in its own structures as well as in the national assembly.\" In a clear government attempt to prevent fallout from the Welsh assembly debacle damaging the entire policy of devolving power, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, yesterday delivered a forceful defence of devolution. Speaking in Edinburgh at a meeting of the joint ministerial committee, he warned that it was important, amid the day-to-day news about devolution, not to lose sight of the longer view. \"The case for devolution starts from the over-centralised, remote and insensitive machinery of government that we inherited in 1997. \"The old, uniform and rigid state - with everything directed from London - denied expression to our regions and nations.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Only time will tell if the US is now experiencing the birth of a new economy or the dying days of a stock market-fuelled economic bubble.</p> <p>US economic performance since 1996 - about the midpoint of this record-breaking expansion - does makes a strong case for a \"new economy\".</p> <p>Gross domestic product (GDP) adjusted for inflation has grown 4.4% per year. Productivity - an index of how much the economy produces in an hour of work - has risen at an impressive 2.7% annual rate. And, after nearly two decades of decline, the inflation-adjusted wages of the typical worker have risen about 2.5% per year.</p> <p>The early days of this expansion, however, were particularly disappointing - remember the \"jobless recovery\"?. Over the entire expansion, which began in March 1991, GDP has grown at a slower, 3.6% annual rate - tying as the slowest rate in the eight expansions since 1949. Productivity growth has averaged 2.2% per year - better than the late 1970s and 1980s, but slower than every other postwar expansion. Despite strong growth since 1996, real wages are today barely 2% better than they were at the peak of the last business cycle in 1990 and are still about 1% below their 1973 level.</p> <p>Without more data - particularly on how the economy fares through the next recession - economists would probably do best withholding final judgment on the roaring 90s.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the main lessons from the \"new economy\" may turn out to be decidedly old-fashioned.</p> <p>First, low unemployment is good for workers. Wages for the typical worker showed no signs of recovery until unemployment fell below 6% in March 1996. Workers at the bottom have benefited disproportionately from low unemployment - and the 1996-97 increases in the federal minimum wage - with wages up almost 10% since 1996. (Meanwhile, a huge untapped supply of labour and the burst in productivity prevented wage rises from translating into higher prices.)</p> <p>Second, the distribution of economic growth matters. While wages have become somewhat more equal since 1996, income inequality (which includes nonwage income) and wealth inequality (driven by the stock market) have worsened considerably over the full business cycle.</p> <p>Third, markets can con tribute only so much to solving social problems.

      "bodyText": "Only time will tell if the US is now experiencing the birth of a new economy or the dying days of a stock market-fuelled economic bubble. US economic performance since 1996 - about the midpoint of this record-breaking expansion - does makes a strong case for a \"new economy\". Gross domestic product (GDP) adjusted for inflation has grown 4.4% per year. Productivity - an index of how much the economy produces in an hour of work - has risen at an impressive 2.7% annual rate. And, after nearly two decades of decline, the inflation-adjusted wages of the typical worker have risen about 2.5% per year. The early days of this expansion, however, were particularly disappointing - remember the \"jobless recovery\"?. Over the entire expansion, which began in March 1991, GDP has grown at a slower, 3.6% annual rate - tying as the slowest rate in the eight expansions since 1949. Productivity growth has averaged 2.2% per year - better than the late 1970s and 1980s, but slower than every other postwar expansion. Despite strong growth since 1996, real wages are today barely 2% better than they were at the peak of the last business cycle in 1990 and are still about 1% below their 1973 level. Without more data - particularly on how the economy fares through the next recession - economists would probably do best withholding final judgment on the roaring 90s. Meanwhile, the main lessons from the \"new economy\" may turn out to be decidedly old-fashioned. First, low unemployment is good for workers. Wages for the typical worker showed no signs of recovery until unemployment fell below 6% in March 1996. Workers at the bottom have benefited disproportionately from low unemployment - and the 1996-97 increases in the federal minimum wage - with wages up almost 10% since 1996. (Meanwhile, a huge untapped supply of labour and the burst in productivity prevented wage rises from translating into higher prices.) Second, the distribution of economic growth matters. While wages have become somewhat more equal since 1996, income inequality (which includes nonwage income) and wealth inequality (driven by the stock market) have worsened considerably over the full business cycle. Third, markets can con tribute only so much to solving social problems. The average low-wage worker made about $5.37 (\u00a33.37) in 1996. The 10% real-wage growth since then translates into an extra 54 cents an hour. These market-driven gains fall far short of what is necessary to put health care within the reach of the 45m Americans still lacking even basic cover. Nor will these gains provide safe, affordable child care for working mothers, or decent housing and quality public education for the 12.7% of the population below the official poverty line. The overvalued stock market, the yawning trade deficit and consumer spending far ahead of income growth - all key ingredients of the boom - point to what may be the hardest lesson from our prosperity: we haven't licked the business cycle yet.

Researchers at the St Jude children's research hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, discovered in December that genetically modified cells implanted in more than a score of patients could have been contaminated. But according to yesterday's Washington Post, the scientists only decided to warn patients and their families on Thursday, when the newspaper told them it had learned of the problem. The hospital was last night expected to make a statement on the issue. The Memphis revelations come at a time of intense anxiety over the pace and style of gene therapy research in the US. The death last year of the teenage gene therapy trial volunteer Jesse Gelsinger; the subsequent government shutdown of all gene therapy trials at the respected Pennsylvania institute where Gelsinger was being treated; and the discovery that gene therapy research teams nationwide had failed to properly report deaths and complications among trial patients have all contributed to a widespread fear in the US that researchers are putting the interests of science and commerce before the interests of patients. The Memphis trials, run jointly with a smaller study at the Baylor college of medicine in Houston, Texas, began in 1995 and involved patients aged under 26 who were dying of cancer.

Earlier this week President Bill Clinton said that federal health agencies would have to speed up their review of US gene therapy rules and guidelines to see whether patients who volunteered to be guinea pigs needed better protection. The agencies responsible for licensing gene therapy tests in Britain, which have given permission for 40 trials since 1992, argue that procedures here are already tighter than in the US. Despite the slow pace of gene therapy research, the scientific community remains optimistic that it will, eventually, start to produce results.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland will hand out \u00a3265m in fees and taxes to pay for the takeover of NatWest, which itself faces a \u00a360m bill for its unsuccessful defence. Royal Bank also faces a hefty bill to remove the top executives at NatWest, who can each demand at least \u00a31m to leave. For Gordon Pell, lured by NatWest from Lloyds TSB last month, it could be a case of \u00a31m for a fortnight's work if Royal Bank decides not to retain him. Ron Sandler, parachuted in as chief operating officer, will also cost as much as \u00a31m to get rid of, while Sir David Rowland, the chairman and chief executive, can expect to be able to command a similar package. Royal Bank's financial advisers at Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Warburg along with lawyers and public relations firms, will share in a \u00a3143m bonanza. NatWest's payout will go to its financial advisers and lawyers. Unlike its predators, NatWest has not disclosed its fees although it is estimated that JP Morgan and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, the investment banking advisers to NatWest, can expect a flat fee of \u00a317.5m each, while the broker Cazenove is estimated to receive \u00a310m. The rest will go on lawyers fees and sundries associated with the bid, such as printing costs. BoS, which has thrown in the towel, will still face a bill from its financial advisers at CSFB, Morgan Stanley and lawyers who had expected to receive \u00a3171m if the bid was successful. They will now have to take a much smaller slice. At least BoS will not have to incur the \u00a3129m stamp duty it faced if successful. BoS will admit the official cost of the bid when it publishes its figures next month but talk in City yesterday still focused on a healthy reward for the unsuccessful advisers after four months of gruelling work.",

      "bodyText": "France Telecom targets Orange France Telecom said it would join in the bidding for Orange, which Vodafone Airtouch must sell under the terms of its takeover of Mannesmann. \"We confirm declarations made yesterday to financial analysts by finance director Jean-Louis Vinciguerra,\" a France Telecom spokesman said. Mr Vinciguerra had noted that the acquisition of Orange would complement France Telecom's investment in cable operator NTL. Manufacturing recovery stalls The recovery in manufacturing industry is showing signs of faltering, according to official figures published yesterday. The office for national statistics reported that manufacturing output in December was down 0.3% on the previous month, while industrial production fell back 0.5%. The falls follow six months of uninterrupted growth in manufacturing output. Compared to a year ago, manufacturing was up 2.1% and total industrial production grew by 1.8% - considerably weaker than the City was expecting. But the ONS also revised down estimates for month-on-month growth in November from 0.6% to 0.3% for manufacturing while overall production was flat compared to a previous estimate of 0.4% growth. Clinton tackles hacker attacks President Bill Clinton will meet next Tuesday with executives from some of America's largest internet companies to discuss ways of preventing hacker attacks against websites. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president called the meeting to \"talk about what our overall long-term plan is and to work through whether we're doing everything we can now\". The move follows several attacks by hackers against popular websites this week that halted service at Yahoo, Buy.com, EBay, Amazon.com, and CNN.com. The attacks are also being looked into by the FBI. 1,500 new rail cars ordered A rail regulatory chief yesterday submitted his own order for new train carriages to speed up the replacement of old slam-door rolling stock. Rail franchising director Mike Grant wants 1,500 new carriages to replace the slam-door trains, beginning with those run on the busy south-east England commuter routes operated by Connex South Central and South West Trains. The unusual move is an attempt to put pressure on Connex and SWT to replace all their slam-door carriages, known as Mk 1 stock. Kelda shuffles top positions Kelda Group announced that John Napier will be succeeding Brandon Gough as non-executive chairman when he retires on March 31. Also with effect from March 31, Jonson Cox will step down from his executive position as managing director of Yorkshire Water Services. He will complete a period of handover and leave the group on July 31. His replacement will be Kevin Whiteman, formerly of the environment agency and now a director of YWS and head of the waste water business unit.",

To be innumerate, according to Collins, is to have neither knowledge nor understanding of mathematics or science. Things are not quite that bad. However, you do not have to have been reading a newspaper, any newspaper, over a very long period to detect a certain unease with figures. We mix metric and imperial, we have lots of trouble with square and cubic measures, we sometimes distort our graphs by scaling them at irregular intervals, we score quite poorly in calculating percentages, we do almost everything you should not do, except perhaps - or only very rarely - succumb to the silliest journalistic naivety, that big numbers are preferable to little ones. </p> <p>This has its most distasteful expression in the tendency to compete in casualty figures after a disaster, something that we deliberately try to ensure we do not do.

      "body": "<p>Dmitri Hvorostovsky has a polished stage presence - almost too much so. Though by his own admission he's a nervous performer, he doesn't so much give to the audience as assume that they will take whatever he offers. But behind the \"because I'm worth it\" looks there's a true musician with a remarkable voice, and to hear a really fine Russian singer perform Russian music is something special. Hvorostovsky has a seemingly bottomless depth of tone and he glides up and down his extensive range betraying no weak points of technique. Though in this challenging recital we had to wait until the very end to hear him at his magical best, there was plenty to intrigue the audience along the way. </p> <p>Three songs by Glinka, regarded as the father of Russian composition, made an interesting start. Doubt, a setting of a poem by Kukolnik, found Hvorostovsky on expressive, lyrical form, though the atmosphere was jolted a little by his too-audible gasps for breath. </p> <p>After the hailstorm of consonants that was Glinka's Travelling Song, Mahler's Kindertotenlieder called for a swift change of mood. Hvorostovsky put some new colours onto his palette, opening the cycle with a flatter, resigned tone and moving to a barely-there, floated sound for the close. These songs are usually heard with orchestra, and the sparser sound of the solo piano highlighted the mournful, slender counterpoint. Mikhail Arkadiev, the accompanist, couldn't quite get around the piano fast enough to come near reproducing the orchestral depiction of a storm in the final song, but the eerie music-box accompaniment in the last verse was haunting. </p> <p>Shostakovich's Suite on Verses of Michelangelo, written 25 years ago in the composer's penultimate year, comes from the same dark world.

      "bodyText": "Dmitri Hvorostovsky has a polished stage presence - almost too much so. Though by his own admission he's a nervous performer, he doesn't so much give to the audience as assume that they will take whatever he offers. But behind the \"because I'm worth it\" looks there's a true musician with a remarkable voice, and to hear a really fine Russian singer perform Russian music is something special. Hvorostovsky has a seemingly bottomless depth of tone and he glides up and down his extensive range betraying no weak points of technique. Though in this challenging recital we had to wait until the very end to hear him at his magical best, there was plenty to intrigue the audience along the way. Three songs by Glinka, regarded as the father of Russian composition, made an interesting start. Doubt, a setting of a poem by Kukolnik, found Hvorostovsky on expressive, lyrical form, though the atmosphere was jolted a little by his too-audible gasps for breath. After the hailstorm of consonants that was Glinka's Travelling Song, Mahler's Kindertotenlieder called for a swift change of mood. Hvorostovsky put some new colours onto his palette, opening the cycle with a flatter, resigned tone and moving to a barely-there, floated sound for the close. These songs are usually heard with orchestra, and the sparser sound of the solo piano highlighted the mournful, slender counterpoint. Mikhail Arkadiev, the accompanist, couldn't quite get around the piano fast enough to come near reproducing the orchestral depiction of a storm in the final song, but the eerie music-box accompaniment in the last verse was haunting. Shostakovich's Suite on Verses of Michelangelo, written 25 years ago in the composer's penultimate year, comes from the same dark world. This is an intensely moving work, and Hvorostovsky will do it full justice when he no longer needs to read it from a music stand. His communication with the audience lost its edge because of this obstacle, leaving room for Arkadiev to come into his own, thundering, hanging back, holding tension and, at times, violently reminding the audience that the piano is indeed a percussion instrument. The tick-tock of chords that closed the final song, Immortality, was followed by the first real silence of the evening from a previously restless audience.

This device drags the play away from its strong and convincing emotional core and feels forced, pretentious. \"Wave wave wave waves,\" Jo says twice. The play already has currents and characters overwhelming enough to sweep us away; such linguistic play feels as out of place as the four women do in their home. Touring Scotland until 5 March",

The Miras loss varies between around \u00a315 and \u00a320 depending on the interest level of the individual mortgage. A \u00a3100,000 interest-only borrower is likely to be paying nearly \u00a3100 a month more by April after the Miras loss if this week's rate is passed on in to borrowers in full. </p> <p>And the current rate rise may not be the last.

There are typically seven savings accounts for each home loan. But the reality is that savers are likely to emerge with as nearly as much misery as borrowers. On previous experence, they will have to wait longer before they are told what increases will emerge on their accounts.

This week these stocks hit new lows. Base rates now stand at 6%. And assuming mortgage lenders pass on the base rate gain in full the variable interest rate at market leader Halifax will be 7.74%, or 1.74% above base rate. </p> <p>Figures from Moneyfacts magazine show that mortgages were only higher than that on one of the previous four occasions when the base rate was 6%. In January 1993, base rates fell from 7% to 6%. The mortgage rate fell to 7.99% in March 1993. The next time rates were at 6% was again on the way down in March 1996. This converted into a 7.25% variable Halifax rate or 1.25% above base rate. </p> <p>In October of the same year the Bank's base rate was again 6% .This time the Halifax did not respond immediately, but held its interest levels at 6.99% before raising them to 7.25% in early 1997. And when interest rates fell to 6% in January 1999, the mortgage cost 7.45%. Now it looks like a 1.74% margin over base rates. </p> <p>But the Halifax argues that its margins over all products did not widen in 1998 compared with 1997. It does not yet have figures for 1999. </p> <p>Savers have not fared better. In January 1993 the Abbey National instant access rate on a \u00a35,000 deposit stood at 4.5% before tax, or 1.5% below base rates. In March 1996 the gap had doubled to 3.1% to produce a gross 2.9%. By October of that year the Abbey had cut their rate to 2.7%, despite base rates standing again at 6%. </p> <p>The reaction to the January 1999 6% base rate was to slash the instant-access rate to just 1.65%, or little more than a third of the 1993 level despite the same underlying base rate. And now, in the unlikely - on past performance - case that the Abbey passes on the whole of the increase to savers, they would still receive no more than 1.55% on \u00a35,000 before tax. </p> <p>Savings banks argue that it is fairer to quote 90-day notice accounts for savings at the \u00a35,000 level. Here, thanks to competition from newcomers such as Standard Life Bank, Scottish Widows Bank and, more recently, the Prudential's online Egg, whose instant access accounts beat most 90-day schemes, average rates quoted in Moneyfacts have held up better. </p> <p>Most lenders are reluctant to discuss rate rises until they announce them. The Abbey National, contented itself with a \"reviewing options\" statement although it seems set to raise costs for borrowers. But the Nationwide, the biggest remaining building society which has kept its variable rates around 0.5% below the stockmarket quoted lenders, has more ominous views. </p> <p>It says: \" We have to consider our position carefully bearing in mind we believe in the strong possibility that base rates may continue to rise over the next few months. We also have to balance the needs of borrowers and savers.\" </p> <p>This could mean an above average increase for Nationwide borrowers next month. Mutuality is no guarantee against margin building. Its current variable mortgage rate is unchanged on a year ago, although base rates have fallen from 6% to 5.75%. And its rates to savers are nothing to get excited about. Its Cashbuilder instant access account is down 0.35% on \u00a35,000 to 2.9%, although it has gone up from 1% to 1.2% on sums from \u00a31 to \u00a3500. </p> <p>Mr Boulger at John Charcol believes that the latest base rate increase \"is highly unlikely to deter those who have made the decision to move home\". And he forecasts that: \"Rates are not going to rocket out of control. I would not be surprised to see an increase in stamp duty at the next budget to help take the heat out of home prices.\" </p> <p>He is also optimistic for borrowers. \"It is generally predicted that 2001 will see interest rates falling as the UK begins to move in line with Europe,\" he says. </p> <p>But a year ago the experts were forecasting exactly the same - for 1999-2000.

Whatever you've been doing your return to work is likely to be both a daunting and exciting prospect as you face a new world of work where voicemails, emails and the latest hand-held computers have taken over the office. </p> <p>Peter Richards, who taught in a secondary school in London before setting off to teach school children in Namibia for two years, describes his return to the UK in 1997 as a culture shock. \"It took me time to readapt,\" admits Peter who read economics at York University. \"In the time that I was abroad the internet was just taking off, and it was something I knew very little about.\" Peter was also unfamiliar with PCs as he had used an Apple Mac at his previous school in London. But thanks to the help of friends in the know Peter learnt how to use the internet, send emails and familiarise himself with a PC in no more than a couple of days. </p> <p>So, if your knowledge of the latest technology is somewhat limited don't panic. </p> <p>A refresher course or the help of a friend will put you on track in no time. It's far more beneficial to plan how you are going to acquire the knowledge you don't have while focusing on the invaluable skills you have acquired while abroad. </p> <p>These skills, coupled with the experience that you have gained while abroad, mean that you will have an edge over your peers who have worked only in the UK. </p> <p>Jim Grassick a development manager responsible for the recruitment of expatriates for Cussons International in Africa and Asia, is a firm believer in the value of experience abroad. He says: \"One of the difficulties we have recruiting from the UK is that most people have no idea of the difficulties associated with working in Africa. Many believe it is one big safari park.

      "bodyText": "Are you about to return to work after a long break? Perhaps you have been working or travelling abroad during your time off. Whatever you've been doing your return to work is likely to be both a daunting and exciting prospect as you face a new world of work where voicemails, emails and the latest hand-held computers have taken over the office. Peter Richards, who taught in a secondary school in London before setting off to teach school children in Namibia for two years, describes his return to the UK in 1997 as a culture shock. \"It took me time to readapt,\" admits Peter who read economics at York University. \"In the time that I was abroad the internet was just taking off, and it was something I knew very little about.\" Peter was also unfamiliar with PCs as he had used an Apple Mac at his previous school in London. But thanks to the help of friends in the know Peter learnt how to use the internet, send emails and familiarise himself with a PC in no more than a couple of days. So, if your knowledge of the latest technology is somewhat limited don't panic. A refresher course or the help of a friend will put you on track in no time. It's far more beneficial to plan how you are going to acquire the knowledge you don't have while focusing on the invaluable skills you have acquired while abroad. These skills, coupled with the experience that you have gained while abroad, mean that you will have an edge over your peers who have worked only in the UK. Jim Grassick a development manager responsible for the recruitment of expatriates for Cussons International in Africa and Asia, is a firm believer in the value of experience abroad. He says: \"One of the difficulties we have recruiting from the UK is that most people have no idea of the difficulties associated with working in Africa. Many believe it is one big safari park. The result is a culture shock when they get there, and often an early departure.\" Going abroad will have given you a chance to sharpen your planning, problem solving and communication skills. \"When you go out to a developing country you find yourself with more responsibilities than you imagined, whereas here, your job description is usually very clearly defined and you stick to it,\" says Carol Milner, head of return volunteer services at VSO. Peter Richards is certain he has boosted his skills portfolio considerably by going abroad. \"I've developed the ability to reach a different type of student and became more resourceful because I taught in a classroom with fewer facilities - all I had was a black board, a few chairs and some desks. Yet despite the lack of resources Peter describes the experience as \"the best two years of my life. I'm a far better teacher as a result\". Once you are fully aware of what you have to offer you can begin to take steps to ensure a smooth transition back to work. Try to return to work you know well in a place you know well, as this will ensure you don't have too many adjustments to make. But if you decide that you don't want to go back to the same job, consider a skills updating course and even shadowing someone who is pursuing the career path you want. If you travelled abroad with an organisation like VSO or Raleigh International, make the most of the career days they offer. These often include guidance on CVs and interviews. Revive contacts with old col leagues and get hold of the latest industry journals. Peter reckons he would have found the transition back to work in the UK much harder without the latter. \"During my last six months in Namibia, VSO sent me out newspapers, so that I was able to keep abreast of current issues.\" If you don't remember anything else, remember this... Overcome any self-doubt by reminding yourself of the skills and talents honed abroad. You might want to consider going freelance initially as you ease your way back into the workforce. This may also help you make an informed decision about where exactly you want to work.

      "bodyText": "Lloyds TSB is rebuilding its acquisitions warchest after buying Scottish Widows, ready for a fresh assault on rivals in Britain and mainland Europe. Peter Ellwood, the bank's chief executive, stressed yesterday he was still looking for deals to accelerate the bank's growth but refused to indicate when or where he might pounce. His comments came against a further fall in the bank's share price to 626p, even though it reported a 20% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a33.6bn in 1999. The bank acknowledged that the movement in its shares, which traded at more than \u00a310 eight months ago, was causing some anguish. \"There's not much doubt somebody thinks we're going to fall off a cliff,\" Sir Brian Pitman, chairman of Lloyds TSB, said. The bank, which has been the star performer in the sector through a series of highly regarded mergers, tried to woo investors yesterday by announcing plans to cut jobs and launch a separately branded internet bank spanning continental Europe and Britain. It also set a target to cut its cost-income ratio - a measure of its efficiency - to 35% by 2002 which Mr Ellwood hoped would become a tough benchmark for the rest of the sector. However, even that target, which would put Lloyds TSB among the most efficient banks in the world, disappointed some analysts who said they had been expecting more. Mr Ellwood said the bank's focus was on \"revenue growth\" generated by selling its customers more products, including life insurance after the takeover of Scottish Widows is completed next month. He also made it clear the bank had ambition and scope for another acquisition in the UK, although he admitted that competition concerns would prevent it tying up with Barclays or NatWest, which last night surrendered to Royal Bank of Scotland. While the bank had also spent most of is much-heralded stash of surplus capital, he insisted the pile would build up rapidly to help fund further deals. \"We spent the warchest when we spent \u00a35.5bn on Scottish Widows but each year it goes up [again],\" Mr Ellwood said. He estimated the surplus capital would increase by \u00a31bn a year. Sir Brian also hinted at expansion in Europe to diversify its revenues, 90% of which are derived in Britain. The bank outlined its strategy to set up a new internet bank in Spain this year, likely to be called e-bank, which would also be rolled out to cus tomers at home later in the year. In the meantime, customers in Britain are already signing up to the domestic Lloyds TSB internet bank which has set its sights on winning 1m customers by the end of the year, a 20% share of the market. While the bank has been criticised for taking too long to develop an internet presence, Hugh Pye, banking analyst at Robert Fleming, said Lloyds had a \"robust and credible\" internet venture. \"They could blow new entrants out of the water,\" Mr Pye said. Lloyds TSB's profit figures showed that its share of the mortgage market had dropped during the year and that growth in its core retail banking business had slowed in the second half of the financial year. The bank will pay a final dividend of 18.5p a share, taking it to a total of 26.6p, a rise of 20%.",

His debut single, Please Don't Send Me Away, was recently Mark and Lard's record of the week on Radio 1, and the assured, alternative folk of his Four Songs EP has already garnered favourable reviews. </p> <p>Here the 21-year-old from Abergavenny is understandably nervous. The place is packed with a \"look and see\" crowd who have been contentedly chattering throughout the previous act (a group of men enthusiastically strumming acoustic guitars). Jay perches uncomfortably on a high chair on the tiny stage, says: \"Phew, it's fucking hot in here,\" in dulcet tones, and launches into Four Minute Rebellion, a song that packs a punch with its intricate guitar work and an engaging mix of vulnerability and braggadocio. \"You're breaking my nose from 25 feet,\" he sings and, for the moment, holds the crowd's attention. </p> <p>Then the band come on - the bassist, drummer and keyboard player - to normalise the proceedings. Jay's wavery, gentle voice doesn't match the power of his guitar-playing, and the band submerges his quirky style. He races through a smoothly melodic Please Don't Send Me Away and a driving, upbeat I Hope She's All Right. By now, though, the crowd are discussing what they had for dinner. Jay wins them back for the slower-paced, more intriguing song Meteorology, with its laid-back 70s feel and metaphorical references to the weather, but shifts again into cheery and chirpy for the penultimate number, sounding like a cross between The La's and Elliot Smith. </p> <p>The short set leaves little time for Jay to overcome his nerves and get into his stride. It isn't until the end, when the band leave the stage and Jay performs the last song alone, that you feel the strong, subtle force of his music. He finishes with a percussive strum, murmurs \"thank you\" and disappears through the exit as fast as possible. This boy has burning potential and an ear for McCartney-esque melody. He just has to learn how to project it. </p> <p><em>Matthew Jay plays The Social, Nottingham (0115-950 5078), on February 15</em></p>",
