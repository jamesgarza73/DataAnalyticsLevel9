She and his first two wives fell prey to substance abuse. He would humiliate them (as he did Margaret Dumont on and off screen). But his targets were not just women, they were the 'insecure, the submissive, the powerless'. He came down hard on those who showed weakness, be they his son, friends, writers or waiters.

He won't take off on me because I'm as fresh as he is. So he leaves me alone and loves me dearly on account of it.' </p> <p>The ups and downs are carefully chronicled - year after year of soul-destroying touring, Broadway hits and flops, the disastrous first foray into film, eventual international triumphs, the Wall Street crash (when Groucho's many prudent investments became worthless), the caprices of studio executives and the onset of radio and TV, over which Groucho triumphed as host of You Bet Your Life. </p> <p>But even he couldn't conquer colour television. How could an audience cope with a man who had been in black and white his whole career? Yet he continued into his eighties, never really coming to terms with the notion of retirement, even after winning an honorary Oscar. </p> <p>The brothers seem to have been as unruly off-camera as on - turning up late, removing producers' trousers and locking them in rooms - yet Groucho would often fret over lines. In A Day at the Races, eyed by a baddie, he chucks his watch in a basin of water: 'I'd rather have it rusty than missing.' On the pre-filming tour dates (several of their movies were road-tested in advance), he tried out 'gone' and 'disappear' 44 times and 'missing' 50. The latter always got the biggest laugh. Asked why some words worked better than others, Groucho said: 'I don't know. I really don't care. I only know the audiences told us it was funny.' </p> <p>His performing style, apparently so artless, was finely honed. His character was a rich creation, 'because he managed to be a wise guy and a sympathetic antihero at the same time', said Chuck Jones, creator of Bugs Bunny. </p> <p>This book is likely to become the definitive commentary on Groucho's life. Kanfer has interviewed everyone he can and read every book, review and interview. He elegantly captures the sheer joy the Marx Brothers can engender. He traces the development of their onstage personas (in which Minnie's brother, Al, a popular entertainer, played a part) and comedic armoury, perhaps at its best when deployed against the pomposity of government and business, targets for which the American public were initially cool. </p> <p>For Kanfer, Groucho was 'a socially ambitious scamp, a loving and insensitive father, a faithful and contemptuous husband, a scripted ad-libber, an infantile grown-up, a fearful iconoclast and, above all, a depressive clown'. </p> <p>Maureen O'Sullivan, on whom he had a crush, observed: 'Groucho never knew when to talk normally.

While other modernists took the incoherence of the world as an affront, or a tragic fact to be stared down, Henry Green (the pen name of Henry Yorke) seems to have accepted it in his fiction simply as a given. His prose isn't difficult as difficulty is normally understood, but it is demanding. Grammar is loosened disconcertingly, punctuation light, so that the reading brain must constantly reassess the relationships between parts of a sentence. </p> <p>Mannerism is pressed into the service of realism. Precisely notated dialogue gives way to lyrical passages whose texture can become scumbled or even blobby. Changes of tone are more often stark than modulated. </p> <p>If Green didn't win a huge readership in his lifetime (1905-73), he also had a tendency to exaggerate setbacks, or even to invent them. Early stories of his were sent by his mother for assessment to John Buchan, a family friend, and even Green's son, Sebastian, believed the verdict was unfavourable ('strongly advised him to give it all up as a bad job'); in fact, the letter survives in a family scrapbook and is quoted here. Buchan was enthusiastic about the writing, but wary of literary careers in general. </p> <p>Perhaps it was because he could be said to have followed this advice that Green had a distorted memory of it. He had a full career in the family business, Pontifex (manufacturers, among other things, of high-pressure filling machines for beer-bottling), starting on the shop floor, and he did a lot of his later writing at head office or else at lunchtimes or after work. The early experience of labour was filtered into Living (1929), his first mature novel, but Green can be exonerated equally of taking a job simply to generate copy or of seeking to overturn the existing power structures. His professional life was one long attempt, long and doomed, to win the approval of a flinty father. </p> <p>Jeremy Treglown's excellent critical biography was authorised by Green's family, if only for a short time (they had earlier given their blessing to Paul Bailey, by whose preliminary work Treglown has profited). Until a late stage, his subtitle was 'The Life and Work of Henry Yorke and Henry Green', but he seems to have realised that the division between the two was anything but stable. If Henry Yorke could privately be snobbish and insensitive, on one occasion rhapsodising in a letter to a needy girlfriend about the diamonds he was buying for his wife, Dig, then Henry Green could also (in his 1940 memoir Pack My Bag) vacillate, as Treglown puts it, between 'class guilt and flagrant snobbery'. </p> <p>Perhaps it's not surprising that he should have been a better observer when a subordinate, whether at the firm's works in Birmingham or in the Auxiliary Fire Service, which he joined in 1949. Caught (1943), the novel based on his AFS experiences, departed so far from the propagandistic pieties that Green himself had doubts about whether it should be translated into German, though several references to firemen stealing had already been suppressed from the published version. </p> <p>Treglown shows an admirable unwillingness to damp down the contradictions in Green's attitudes and behaviour, and extends the same courtesy to many of his sources. Green was friendly with Evelyn Waugh, who was slightly older, and also Anthony Powell, an exact contemporary. Waugh's attitude went from sustained and generous early praise to seething postwar rancour, a characteristic trajectory, though any rancour might be expected to flow in the other direction. </p> <p>In 1945, both Green and Waugh published novels set in country houses, but it was Brideshead Revisited rather than the exquisite Loving which caught or created a national mood. </p> <p>Powell's testimony shows a more veiled hostility to his old friend. He once left a cheque after spending a few days as a guest in the Yorkes' house, and was astounded when Green accepted it (with a letter saying the sum was 'far too much', but 'very good of you in these hard times'). By a number of codes, not all of them patrician, nothing could be ruder than offering to pay for hospitality. Clearly, Green had a sharpened awareness of money, an awareness more paranoid than practical. But perhaps he was simply calling Powell's bluff.</p> <p>That Powell was capable of using politeness as an aid to rudeness is shown by an anecdote of Eudora Welty's. On a 1950 visit to promote a book of her own (during which she and Green were to make an enormous mutual impression), she gathered that Powell had published a book. She asked for its title, and was told: 'That question is not asked.' With an obliqueness that might appeal to the book's subject, Treglown delegates criticism of one of his sources to another. </p> <p> Romancing takes its title from Green's hobby as listed in Who's Who: 'Romancing over the bottle, to a good band.' Evidently, 'romancing' has two meanings, but the bottle, alas, has only one. How far Green's wife was aware of his affairs (including one with her younger sister) isn't clear; perhaps that question, too, was not asked. Green's drinking and the collapses it provoked were talked about essentially as a series of bad colds. </p> <p>After two unusually controlled novels - Nothing (1950) and Doting (1952) - he entered a long silence. His relationship with his writing had always been precarious - the art shoring up the life and vice versa. From outside, the mutual collapse seems wilful, but his earlier comments have an edge of panic - he refers to 'a frightful surge of power and ideas' while writing Back (1946). </p> <p>In a 1958 interview, he announced that once it's printed you can't kill a book the way you can a child, 'by putting your hands round its wet little neck'. In a writer, it's not the mock-murderousness towards children that is alarming, but the hostility towards books. Green's unstrangulated novels are as fresh as when they were written, as radiant and unconsoling.</p>",

Buchan was enthusiastic about the writing, but wary of literary careers in general. Perhaps it was because he could be said to have followed this advice that Green had a distorted memory of it. He had a full career in the family business, Pontifex (manufacturers, among other things, of high-pressure filling machines for beer-bottling), starting on the shop floor, and he did a lot of his later writing at head office or else at lunchtimes or after work. The early experience of labour was filtered into Living (1929), his first mature novel, but Green can be exonerated equally of taking a job simply to generate copy or of seeking to overturn the existing power structures. His professional life was one long attempt, long and doomed, to win the approval of a flinty father. Jeremy Treglown's excellent critical biography was authorised by Green's family, if only for a short time (they had earlier given their blessing to Paul Bailey, by whose preliminary work Treglown has profited). Until a late stage, his subtitle was 'The Life and Work of Henry Yorke and Henry Green', but he seems to have realised that the division between the two was anything but stable. If Henry Yorke could privately be snobbish and insensitive, on one occasion rhapsodising in a letter to a needy girlfriend about the diamonds he was buying for his wife, Dig, then Henry Green could also (in his 1940 memoir Pack My Bag) vacillate, as Treglown puts it, between 'class guilt and flagrant snobbery'. Perhaps it's not surprising that he should have been a better observer when a subordinate, whether at the firm's works in Birmingham or in the Auxiliary Fire Service, which he joined in 1949. Caught (1943), the novel based on his AFS experiences, departed so far from the propagandistic pieties that Green himself had doubts about whether it should be translated into German, though several references to firemen stealing had already been suppressed from the published version. Treglown shows an admirable unwillingness to damp down the contradictions in Green's attitudes and behaviour, and extends the same courtesy to many of his sources. Green was friendly with Evelyn Waugh, who was slightly older, and also Anthony Powell, an exact contemporary. Waugh's attitude went from sustained and generous early praise to seething postwar rancour, a characteristic trajectory, though any rancour might be expected to flow in the other direction. In 1945, both Green and Waugh published novels set in country houses, but it was Brideshead Revisited rather than the exquisite Loving which caught or created a national mood. Powell's testimony shows a more veiled hostility to his old friend. He once left a cheque after spending a few days as a guest in the Yorkes' house, and was astounded when Green accepted it (with a letter saying the sum was 'far too much', but 'very good of you in these hard times'). By a number of codes, not all of them patrician, nothing could be ruder than offering to pay for hospitality. Clearly, Green had a sharpened awareness of money, an awareness more paranoid than practical. But perhaps he was simply calling Powell's bluff. That Powell was capable of using politeness as an aid to rudeness is shown by an anecdote of Eudora Welty's. On a 1950 visit to promote a book of her own (during which she and Green were to make an enormous mutual impression), she gathered that Powell had published a book. She asked for its title, and was told: 'That question is not asked.' With an obliqueness that might appeal to the book's subject, Treglown delegates criticism of one of his sources to another. Romancing takes its title from Green's hobby as listed in Who's Who: 'Romancing over the bottle, to a good band.' Evidently, 'romancing' has two meanings, but the bottle, alas, has only one. How far Green's wife was aware of his affairs (including one with her younger sister) isn't clear; perhaps that question, too, was not asked. Green's drinking and the collapses it provoked were talked about essentially as a series of bad colds. After two unusually controlled novels - Nothing (1950) and Doting (1952) - he entered a long silence. His relationship with his writing had always been precarious - the art shoring up the life and vice versa. From outside, the mutual collapse seems wilful, but his earlier comments have an edge of panic - he refers to 'a frightful surge of power and ideas' while writing Back (1946). In a 1958 interview, he announced that once it's printed you can't kill a book the way you can a child, 'by putting your hands round its wet little neck'. In a writer, it's not the mock-murderousness towards children that is alarming, but the hostility towards books. Green's unstrangulated novels are as fresh as when they were written, as radiant and unconsoling.",

He takes us on a fairground ride through the British Culture Zone, noting glibly, for example, that by 1954, the House, 'the BBC, the Church, the Royal Navy and the England football team were all struggling with questions of identity and strategy'. In the Swinging Sixties, under Wilson's Labour government, the ROH was becoming increasingly \u00e9litist, with Nureyev and Fonteyn as hot (and expensive) tickets as Domingo and Callas. </p> <p>By the 1970s, the dilemma was painfully obvious. Seat prices were too high, touring and TV recording fees too expensive. The House needed a huge subsidy but taxpayers could not continually be squeezed for performances they could never see. The cosy consensus between the great and the good on the ROH board, the Cabinet and the Arts Council started to unravel. The redevelopment saga, from the 1980s onwards, imposed further strains. Lebrecht joins the plot in person as he chronicles the soap-opera cliffhangers in his newspaper column. </p> <p>This is no more an untold story than the latest Diana revelations. But Lebrecht tells it vividly, as he stalks the wings and corridors of the beleaguered building. His pen-portraits of key personalities, dead and alive, are persuasive, prejudiced, kind and cruel in equal measure. He makes some howlers where ballet is concerned, though he describes convincingly how it lost out to opera on the sociocultural battlefield. </p> <p>The twists and turns in the ROH's struggle for survival are by no means over. Lebrecht throws in the towel in his conclusion, opting for privatisation. In giving up state subsidy, he imagines the ROH would have nothing to lose but its chains. And its ballet company.</p>",

He takes us on a fairground ride through the British Culture Zone, noting glibly, for example, that by 1954, the House, 'the BBC, the Church, the Royal Navy and the England football team were all struggling with questions of identity and strategy'. In the Swinging Sixties, under Wilson's Labour government, the ROH was becoming increasingly \u00e9litist, with Nureyev and Fonteyn as hot (and expensive) tickets as Domingo and Callas. By the 1970s, the dilemma was painfully obvious. Seat prices were too high, touring and TV recording fees too expensive. The House needed a huge subsidy but taxpayers could not continually be squeezed for performances they could never see. The cosy consensus between the great and the good on the ROH board, the Cabinet and the Arts Council started to unravel. The redevelopment saga, from the 1980s onwards, imposed further strains. Lebrecht joins the plot in person as he chronicles the soap-opera cliffhangers in his newspaper column. This is no more an untold story than the latest Diana revelations. But Lebrecht tells it vividly, as he stalks the wings and corridors of the beleaguered building. His pen-portraits of key personalities, dead and alive, are persuasive, prejudiced, kind and cruel in equal measure. He makes some howlers where ballet is concerned, though he describes convincingly how it lost out to opera on the sociocultural battlefield. The twists and turns in the ROH's struggle for survival are by no means over. Lebrecht throws in the towel in his conclusion, opting for privatisation. In giving up state subsidy, he imagines the ROH would have nothing to lose but its chains. And its ballet company.",

Perhaps you have a postcard of his painting of Samuel Beckett directing Waiting for Godot, superscribed with the immortal remark: No Matter. Try Again. Fail Again. Fail Better.

Or read his translation of The Inferno ? Or his 'treated novel', A Humument, in which certain words in the Victorian text have been highlighted to create weird poetry, visual and verbal?

Following his nose, driven by his subtle curiosity, he digs deeper and deeper into whatever it is that has caught his fancy, with many a complex joke along the way, getting closer and closer to the heart of the matter - a spy in the house of art. Very often, the point of entry has seemed most unpromising. But Mole Phillips knows better. If you keep going, you end up at the centre of the world. So it is with The Postcard Century. </p> <p>It sounds like the idea of madman, a Pooterish activity taken to a pitch of absurd ambition, a life's work invented by some wickedly satirical novelist: to tell the history of the twentieth century through postcards. Postcards - the very word seems to belong to another epoch. They are things sent by maiden aunts from Bexhill to their sisters in Sydenham, surely? But Phillips would answer, quite fiercely, first, that maiden aunts and their sisters are deeply interesting, as everything is if examined properly and compassionately, and second, that everyone has at one time or another sent and received postcards. </p> <p>It is (or was) a universal habit. Postcards were first approved by the Post Office as late as 1894, so they almost perfectly coincide with the twentieth century (Phillips doubts whether they will outlast it), providing a constantly changing pictorial record of fashion and taste. But beyond that, he says: 'It has defined life rather than mirrored it, giving a more human picture of the world than any other medium.' </p> <p>The picture is only the half of it. Phillips is as concerned with what is written on the cards, 'these marvellous receptacles of memory, bearers of image and carriers of news'. </p> <p>Examining the formulas adopted by most writers of cards - inquiries about health, weather report, comment on delights of place depicted what he calls the haiku of the medium - he uncovers whole worlds of experience in their brief and frequently ungrammatical phrases, a poetry which discloses the 'authentic inconsequentiality' of lived life. His interest in all human activity, probing, tender, precise, respectful, as if he were a surgeon of the human condition, lends this book a deeply touching dimension. </p> <p>The story of Max Church, for example, author of a series of postcards during and after the Second World War, culminates in what Phillips rightly calls 'a message that could be expanded into a novel': 'Dear Dad. When you write next time could you include Pierre Braun's name, it will make him feel that my parents have accepted him as he has accepted me.' </p> <p>The author's labyrinthine mind, encompassing history, sociology, psychology and the further reaches of philosophy, finds its perfect expression in the annotations attached to each card - 20 or so per year - quietly (that word again) delivering a detailed meditation on twentieth-century life. It is, he says, his millennium project and it is worth a thousand Domes. </p> <p>It is a monument, of sorts, an intimate portrait both of the last century, but also of Phillips himself. His affection for mankind in all its quirkiness extends to the collectors of cards themselves, the deltiologists, if they're American, or, if they're French, les cartophiles. The Goat Man (they are identified like Freudian case histories) has discovered a hidden caprine world in which the supposed main event of the postcard is, for him, subservient to the glimpse of goat it obscurely contains; inevitably, Phillips notes, he sports a little grey beard. </p> <p>One signs himself Old Mr Postcard, which is almost what Phillips has become. His obsessive odyssey now at an end, a tinge of melancholy pervades the pages of what is a perfect and a perfectly original book, splendidly produced by Thames and Hudson, whose name is celebrated with the inclusion of an annual postcard depicting, side by side, Piccadilly Circus and the Manhattan skyline. </p> <p>It has the appearance of a coffee-table book, but beware - open it at any page and you will be there for the duration.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Rimbaud </strong><br>Graham Robb<br>Picador \u00a320, pp562<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000000758,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>One of the nice things about Graham Robb's superb biography of Rimbaud is that it reminds you that, when it comes to shocking behaviour, our present-day bohemians are lightweights. Our poets write thousand-line epics about the Millennium Dome; Damien drops his trousers in the Groucho; Tracey gets drunk and tells everyone that she wants her mum; our rock stars Just Say No to everything but a cup of cocoa and an early night. </p> <p>They have no idea. In 1871, the preferred hang-out of the 16-year-old Rimbaud was a caf\u00e9 called the Dead Rat. One evening, a bored Rimbaud put sulphuric acid in his friend Charles Cros's drink while he was in the loo. They were always stabbing each other without provocation, sometimes seriously, but it's the last incident which makes you wonder what you had to do to be barred from the Dead Rat. Fed up with the artist Forain's praise of paint as a medium, Rimbaud dropped his trousers, shat on the table and started to draw in this 'powerful impasto'. </p> <p>Rimbaud's story remains utterly incredible. Born into a poor provincial family, he was performing feats of prodigious intelligence by his early teens. Poetry came quickly, but it was quite unlike the usual productions of the prodigious teenage poet; it showed, from the start, a complete mastery of French classical forms and prosody, combined with an alarmingly original style. No one could have seen what Rimbaud was doing, because it was completely unprecedented and unimaginable; a schoolboy somehow writing some of the greatest masterpieces of French poetry. </p> <p>The poetry is hard to describe and exhilarating, mad, exhausting in effect. 'Le Bateau Ivre' and 'Ce Qu'on Dit Au Poete' are alarming poems, following a train of thought without self-consciousness, a stream of images constrained, it seems, only by the classical perfection of the verse. You can hardly ever hear any kind of influence; 'Chercheuses de poux' is surely meant as a parody of Baudelaire, not a homage to him. Poets are made by what they read, but nothing will help you come to the 'Vowels' sonnet; it is as unprecedented as the 'Sonnet to the Arsehole'. As for the two little books with which Rimbaud concluded his life's work, the Saison en Enfer and Les Illuminations, there is nothing like them in world literature, and there never will be. </p> <p>At 15, Rimbaud had done with Charleville, the dreary little town where he grew up, and set off to Paris. What followed has been told many times, but remains fascinating; he attracted the attention of Paul Verlaine by sending him five of his lewdest poems, and quickly moved in with the elder poet and his wife. A short seduction followed; it was part of Rimbaud's plan to persuade Verlaine to spend vast amounts of money, drink implausible amounts of absinthe and copulate ceaselessly (Rimbaud took the passive role; he said that Verlaine was too dirty to bugger, though Rimbaud, who hardly bathed more than twice a year, could hardly have presented a very inviting prospect himself). </p> <p>Almost incredible amounts of bad behaviour followed. Verlaine's marriage broke down; the pair fled to Brussels and then London. Their idea of a quiet night in was to stab each other with kitchen knives wrapped in towels, so as not actually to kill each other, followed by an energetic bout of sodomy. London suited Rimbaud; he was one of nature's \u00e9migr\u00e9s, and the fogs, the secrecy and the odd, disorderly language started to work their way into his poetry. Les Illuminations is full of English idioms, literally translated, and we know from Verlaine's transliteration that the title is pronounced in an English accent, Illumin\u00e9cheunes. </p> <p>Given the fecundity and inventiveness of Rimbaud's last poems, what followed remains almost incredible. He gave up and, after the age of 21, never wrote again. Instead, he went to Africa where, according to Robb, he became a hard-headed and successful trader, dealing in anything from guns to slaves. He grew out of literature, as he had always expected to grow out of Europe. He only returned to die, aged 36, just as his poetic reputation was growing to colossal proportions. Auden said that he dreamt of a 'truth acceptable to lying men'; it would be more accurate to say, after reading, slack-jawed, the oeuvres po\u00e9tiques, that Rimbaud represents a glorious and radiantly deplorable set of lies, thrown in the face of the habitually truthful. </p> <p>In one sense, Rimbaud is a biographer's dream; it is the most extraordinary story, and it practically tells itself. But in another, more practical aspect, he is a complete nightmare. We know some surprising things about him, such as (thanks to a Brussels police report) the appearance of his penis ('short and not very voluminous') and anus ('can be dilated quite markedly'). More obviously interesting things remain obscure. His life was so rackety that there are long periods when he quite simply disappears. The second half of his life was spent in a largely unmapped Africa where he tried to conceal his business dealings and how much money he was making. He disappeared for weeks and months at a time, sleeping rough and leaving no record. </p> <p>He wrote everything so young that hardly anyone who met him thought of making the sort of useful, respectful record of his conversation which a biographer needs; his fame was posthumous. Poems, letters, documentation were lost, and may still surface; someone saw a suitcase of manuscripts in Africa after the Second World War, which has now disappeared. </p> <p>Robb has written a marvellous biography, which pieces all this together from scraps of evidence.

      "bodyText": "Rimbaud Graham Robb Picador \u00a320, pp562 Buy it at BOL One of the nice things about Graham Robb's superb biography of Rimbaud is that it reminds you that, when it comes to shocking behaviour, our present-day bohemians are lightweights. Our poets write thousand-line epics about the Millennium Dome; Damien drops his trousers in the Groucho; Tracey gets drunk and tells everyone that she wants her mum; our rock stars Just Say No to everything but a cup of cocoa and an early night. They have no idea. In 1871, the preferred hang-out of the 16-year-old Rimbaud was a caf\u00e9 called the Dead Rat. One evening, a bored Rimbaud put sulphuric acid in his friend Charles Cros's drink while he was in the loo. They were always stabbing each other without provocation, sometimes seriously, but it's the last incident which makes you wonder what you had to do to be barred from the Dead Rat. Fed up with the artist Forain's praise of paint as a medium, Rimbaud dropped his trousers, shat on the table and started to draw in this 'powerful impasto'. Rimbaud's story remains utterly incredible. Born into a poor provincial family, he was performing feats of prodigious intelligence by his early teens. Poetry came quickly, but it was quite unlike the usual productions of the prodigious teenage poet; it showed, from the start, a complete mastery of French classical forms and prosody, combined with an alarmingly original style. No one could have seen what Rimbaud was doing, because it was completely unprecedented and unimaginable; a schoolboy somehow writing some of the greatest masterpieces of French poetry. The poetry is hard to describe and exhilarating, mad, exhausting in effect. 'Le Bateau Ivre' and 'Ce Qu'on Dit Au Poete' are alarming poems, following a train of thought without self-consciousness, a stream of images constrained, it seems, only by the classical perfection of the verse. You can hardly ever hear any kind of influence; 'Chercheuses de poux' is surely meant as a parody of Baudelaire, not a homage to him. Poets are made by what they read, but nothing will help you come to the 'Vowels' sonnet; it is as unprecedented as the 'Sonnet to the Arsehole'. As for the two little books with which Rimbaud concluded his life's work, the Saison en Enfer and Les Illuminations, there is nothing like them in world literature, and there never will be. At 15, Rimbaud had done with Charleville, the dreary little town where he grew up, and set off to Paris. What followed has been told many times, but remains fascinating; he attracted the attention of Paul Verlaine by sending him five of his lewdest poems, and quickly moved in with the elder poet and his wife. A short seduction followed; it was part of Rimbaud's plan to persuade Verlaine to spend vast amounts of money, drink implausible amounts of absinthe and copulate ceaselessly (Rimbaud took the passive role; he said that Verlaine was too dirty to bugger, though Rimbaud, who hardly bathed more than twice a year, could hardly have presented a very inviting prospect himself). Almost incredible amounts of bad behaviour followed. Verlaine's marriage broke down; the pair fled to Brussels and then London. Their idea of a quiet night in was to stab each other with kitchen knives wrapped in towels, so as not actually to kill each other, followed by an energetic bout of sodomy. London suited Rimbaud; he was one of nature's \u00e9migr\u00e9s, and the fogs, the secrecy and the odd, disorderly language started to work their way into his poetry. Les Illuminations is full of English idioms, literally translated, and we know from Verlaine's transliteration that the title is pronounced in an English accent, Illumin\u00e9cheunes. Given the fecundity and inventiveness of Rimbaud's last poems, what followed remains almost incredible. He gave up and, after the age of 21, never wrote again. Instead, he went to Africa where, according to Robb, he became a hard-headed and successful trader, dealing in anything from guns to slaves. He grew out of literature, as he had always expected to grow out of Europe. He only returned to die, aged 36, just as his poetic reputation was growing to colossal proportions. Auden said that he dreamt of a 'truth acceptable to lying men'; it would be more accurate to say, after reading, slack-jawed, the oeuvres po\u00e9tiques, that Rimbaud represents a glorious and radiantly deplorable set of lies, thrown in the face of the habitually truthful. In one sense, Rimbaud is a biographer's dream; it is the most extraordinary story, and it practically tells itself. But in another, more practical aspect, he is a complete nightmare. We know some surprising things about him, such as (thanks to a Brussels police report) the appearance of his penis ('short and not very voluminous') and anus ('can be dilated quite markedly'). More obviously interesting things remain obscure. His life was so rackety that there are long periods when he quite simply disappears. The second half of his life was spent in a largely unmapped Africa where he tried to conceal his business dealings and how much money he was making. He disappeared for weeks and months at a time, sleeping rough and leaving no record. He wrote everything so young that hardly anyone who met him thought of making the sort of useful, respectful record of his conversation which a biographer needs; his fame was posthumous. Poems, letters, documentation were lost, and may still surface; someone saw a suitcase of manuscripts in Africa after the Second World War, which has now disappeared. Robb has written a marvellous biography, which pieces all this together from scraps of evidence. He has the right qualifications; he sees how fine the poetry is and how loathsome Rimbaud must have been. He can be drily amusing at the expense of Rimbaud and his often embarrassing biographers, while never entertaining doubts about the value of the poetry. It's rare for a biographer to have more than one really good biography in him; by his third, passionate involvement has generally given way to a sense of duty. By following his sensationally good lives of Balzac and Hugo with this unforgettably truthful Rimbaud, Robb elevates himself into the Hilary Spurling class. It has one virtue which, though it was never of much interest to his subject, is quite indispensable to a great biographer; it is always tactful.",

His chapter on the great plagues of medieval Britain, and their impact on high policy and everyday life, is at once terrifying and moving, sympathetic and suggestive. </p> <p>From these sombre pages, Schama makes an easy transition to the cruel majesty of Henry VIII, whose destruction of Anne Boleyn was 'one part pornography, one part paranoia'; to the crazed and bloody religious persecutions of Queen Mary; and finally to the accession of Good Queen Bess. The Elizabethan climax to this volume (part two, from 1603-2001, will appear in the new year) shows Schama at his narrative best and thematically most inspired. There's a splendid passage on the cult of the Virgin Queen, a horror movie rendering of Mary Queen of Scots' execution and, perhaps best of all, an exquisite aside on the place of the oak in English history: </p> <p> 'Ancient Britons were thought to have worshipped them; righteous outlaws are sheltered by them; kings on the run hide in them; hearts of oak go to sea and win empires.' </p> <p> For all that, Schama's Europhile preferences colour his account of that supreme 'hearts of oak' episode: the Spanish Armada. Having described how the Spanish fleet was almost comically vulnerable to Drake's quick-fire fleet and the treacherous waters of the Channel, he concludes that: 'It was in the waters between Scotland and Ireland that the Enterprise of England truly came to grief: the sailors and soldiers were drowned, starved, ravaged by typhus, or picked off by the Irish.' </p> <p>Schama also writes with witty eloquence about the excesses of 'Bessiemania', but in truth he is not the first historian to be more than half seduced by Elizabeth's extraordinary combination of ice-cool statecraft and hot-blooded chauvinism. Determined to show that it was Elizabeth who gave coherence to the fledgling idea of Great Britain, Schama brings down the curtain on his performance with a fine flourish: 'By remaining unmarried, she had, in the end, brought about a momentous union: that of Scotland and England, not yet in one kingdom, but in one person... she had not been barren then, after all.' </p> <p>With a bit of luck, this book will remind the Prime Minister that we still enjoy that Elizabethan inheritance, by the skin of our teeth.</p>",

From these sombre pages, Schama makes an easy transition to the cruel majesty of Henry VIII, whose destruction of Anne Boleyn was 'one part pornography, one part paranoia'; to the crazed and bloody religious persecutions of Queen Mary; and finally to the accession of Good Queen Bess. The Elizabethan climax to this volume (part two, from 1603-2001, will appear in the new year) shows Schama at his narrative best and thematically most inspired. There's a splendid passage on the cult of the Virgin Queen, a horror movie rendering of Mary Queen of Scots' execution and, perhaps best of all, an exquisite aside on the place of the oak in English history: 'Ancient Britons were thought to have worshipped them; righteous outlaws are sheltered by them; kings on the run hide in them; hearts of oak go to sea and win empires.' For all that, Schama's Europhile preferences colour his account of that supreme 'hearts of oak' episode: the Spanish Armada. Having described how the Spanish fleet was almost comically vulnerable to Drake's quick-fire fleet and the treacherous waters of the Channel, he concludes that: 'It was in the waters between Scotland and Ireland that the Enterprise of England truly came to grief: the sailors and soldiers were drowned, starved, ravaged by typhus, or picked off by the Irish.' Schama also writes with witty eloquence about the excesses of 'Bessiemania', but in truth he is not the first historian to be more than half seduced by Elizabeth's extraordinary combination of ice-cool statecraft and hot-blooded chauvinism. Determined to show that it was Elizabeth who gave coherence to the fledgling idea of Great Britain, Schama brings down the curtain on his performance with a fine flourish: 'By remaining unmarried, she had, in the end, brought about a momentous union: that of Scotland and England, not yet in one kingdom, but in one person... she had not been barren then, after all.' With a bit of luck, this book will remind the Prime Minister that we still enjoy that Elizabethan inheritance, by the skin of our teeth.",

But there is a very good reason for this - it is not yet 6am. Having spent most of the night thinking about work rather than sleeping, I am cutting my losses and going in. </p> <p>That was a few years ago and I have changed my working practices and attitudes a lot since. At the time I would have said I had no choice as I was overworked, but I still remember the buzz I felt sitting on that empty train. That feeling, when I analysed it later, disturbed me. Was I becoming a work addict? </p> <p>Could this apply to you? </p> <p>The phrase 'work addiction' was not in our vocabularies when I made that trip to Waterloo, but there appears to be a lot of it about now. A survey conducted by the Institute for Personnel and Development shows that more than a million workers in Britain consider themselves 'addicted' to their jobs and voluntarily work extra hours. A third of these self-diagnosed addicts were self-employed. </p> <p>Adrian Cole is senior addiction therapist at the Priory Clinic, Bristol, and regularly treats work addicts. 'Addiction is a pathological relationship with an object or event, which means it can happen in any job,' he says. 'Although we see more men than women, it's not related to occupation or to how high up the ladder you are - we see the full range, from managing directors to technicians.' The clinic uses a 40-point questionnaire to assess a patient's degree of addiction. </p> <p>How many of the million in the IPD survey would be diagnosed as addicts by Cole? Perhaps more than you think. 'Work addiction is becoming more prevalent at the clinic,' he says, 'and like any other drug, it can, if pursued to its conclusion, be fatal. In Japan, 10 per cent of male deaths are work-related.' </p> <p>Addiction often manifests itself in long hours. In the IPD research, one in three of the people working more than 48 hours a week - the threshold under the Working Time Regulations - said they were addicted. But, says Cole, you don't need to be working all hours to be hooked. 'You may be working nine to five - but if all the time you're at home watching TV you're actually thinking about work, you need to think about what that means. We also see binge working, like binge drinking.' </p> <p>Comparisons with alcohol addiction go further. The Priory's treatment programme uses the first four of the famous 12 steps used by Alcoholics Anonymous. However, there is an important difference. 'Unlike alcohol addiction, we're not asking work addicts to give it up completely,' says Cole. 'That's not possible. The idea is to regain a healthy relationship with work. But while the act of not drinking may be difficult, the idea itself is simple. The ideas around work are more complex.' </p> <p>At the Priory, work addicts are admitted as either inpatients or outpatients to the treatment programme - four to five weeks of group sessions, videos and written work, including keeping a diary. 'Most people don't work while they are on the programme,' says Cole. 'But once they leave, some go back full-time, others part-time. Some retire. About 70 per cent will experience better lives as a result.' </p> <p>Cole believes all of us are potential addicts. 'Everyone likes to change the way they feel,' he says. 'When we find something that works for us, we go back to it. For some, it gets out of control. The point is that, initially, addiction works.' </p> <p>Work addiction is particularly insidious in this way. For a time it brings praise, promotion and higher pay. 'At first, work addiction is beneficial to the individual, their family, their company and society,' says Cole. 'But as returns diminish, addicts will strive even harder to chase that rainbow - even when deep down inside they know it isn't working.' </p> <p>Perfectionism, a need to be in control, low self-esteem and a preference for working alone rather than in teams are the classic character traits in work addicts. Cole is keen not to blame modern working culture - 'addicts use whatever is around; it's not new'. But when working practices exacerbate those characteristics, it is a cause for concern. </p> <p>Long hours, less job security and performance-related pay all make addiction easier to hide or to rationalise. Last year's Joseph Rowntree study, which showed that job insecurity had increased, also found a high correlation between poor general health and job insecurity. </p> <p>Nick Isles of the IPD says businesses gain nothing from overwork. 'When they work long hours, workers make mistakes and their relationships suffer,' he says. 'Businesses are realising that and we're seeing a backlash against the long-hours culture and presenteeism [being there to match or outdo colleagues' hours]. It's about working smarter, not longer.' </p> <p>Cole agrees. 'We have more and more companies coming here for seminars in healthy working. Work addicts are unproductive: no company wants that.' </p> <p>But Isles has a worry for the future: 'It's difficult to get the healthy working message over to self-employed people who love what they're doing.' 'Look at dotcom companies, for example.' This will be the IPD's next area of research, Isles says. </p> <p>But can you get addicted to addiction research? </p> <p>\u0095 There are 13 Priory hospitals in the UK. They take NHS and private patients and offer a free initial assessment to anyone who thinks they may be addicted. Call 0117 952 5255 for details. </p> <p><strong>Awkward questions to ask yourself</strong></p> <p> Do I regularly do any of the following things? </p> <p> \u0095 Get impatient in slow-moving queues </p> <p> \u0095 Find myself doing two or three things at once, such as eating lunch and writing a memo </p> <p> \u0095 Tend to put myself under pressure with self-imposed deadlines </p> <p> \u0095 Get upset with myself for the smallest mistake </p> <p> \u0095 Prefer to do things myself rather than ask for help</p> <p>These are five out of 25 questions asked of potential addicts (chosen simply because they struck a chord with me).

At the Priory, work addicts are admitted as either inpatients or outpatients to the treatment programme - four to five weeks of group sessions, videos and written work, including keeping a diary. 'Most people don't work while they are on the programme,' says Cole. 'But once they leave, some go back full-time, others part-time. Some retire. About 70 per cent will experience better lives as a result.' Cole believes all of us are potential addicts. 'Everyone likes to change the way they feel,' he says. 'When we find something that works for us, we go back to it. For some, it gets out of control. The point is that, initially, addiction works.' Work addiction is particularly insidious in this way. For a time it brings praise, promotion and higher pay. 'At first, work addiction is beneficial to the individual, their family, their company and society,' says Cole. 'But as returns diminish, addicts will strive even harder to chase that rainbow - even when deep down inside they know it isn't working.' Perfectionism, a need to be in control, low self-esteem and a preference for working alone rather than in teams are the classic character traits in work addicts. Cole is keen not to blame modern working culture - 'addicts use whatever is around; it's not new'. But when working practices exacerbate those characteristics, it is a cause for concern. Long hours, less job security and performance-related pay all make addiction easier to hide or to rationalise. Last year's Joseph Rowntree study, which showed that job insecurity had increased, also found a high correlation between poor general health and job insecurity. Nick Isles of the IPD says businesses gain nothing from overwork. 'When they work long hours, workers make mistakes and their relationships suffer,' he says. 'Businesses are realising that and we're seeing a backlash against the long-hours culture and presenteeism [being there to match or outdo colleagues' hours]. It's about working smarter, not longer.' Cole agrees. 'We have more and more companies coming here for seminars in healthy working. Work addicts are unproductive: no company wants that.' But Isles has a worry for the future: 'It's difficult to get the healthy working message over to self-employed people who love what they're doing.' 'Look at dotcom companies, for example.' This will be the IPD's next area of research, Isles says. But can you get addicted to addiction research? \u0095 There are 13 Priory hospitals in the UK. They take NHS and private patients and offer a free initial assessment to anyone who thinks they may be addicted. Call 0117 952 5255 for details. Awkward questions to ask yourself Do I regularly do any of the following things? \u0095 Get impatient in slow-moving queues \u0095 Find myself doing two or three things at once, such as eating lunch and writing a memo \u0095 Tend to put myself under pressure with self-imposed deadlines \u0095 Get upset with myself for the smallest mistake \u0095 Prefer to do things myself rather than ask for help These are five out of 25 questions asked of potential addicts (chosen simply because they struck a chord with me). Score 1 for never, 2 for sometimes true, 3 for often true and 4 for always true. The questionnaire first appeared in Addiction Today (www.addictiontoday.co.uk ) Verdict 5-10: you are not overdoing it ; 10-14: you are mildly overdoing it ; 14-20: you are seriously overdoing it.",

So, before you sign your name on that first job contract, listen up. </p> <p>First, let's get something straight. There's nothing wrong with taking the first job you're offered, as long as it's the \"right\" job. And what with parental pressures (\"We're not supporting you anymore\", \"It's time you found your own place\" etc), the burden of student debts and the desire to join your peers on the career ladder, it's easy to make a first job mistake. There are many: joining a company where you don't fit in; realising the industry bores you; finding out you're trapped (for example, media sales is not a launch-pad into a career as a war correspondent); simply being unrealistic (you might have great ideas to turn round Marks &amp; Spencer's fortunes, but no-one will make you chairman straight out of college). </p> <p>It's obvious, but if you don't apply for the wrong first job, you won't be offered it. The trick, according to Imogen Daniels, adviser to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, is to do as much pre-application research as possible - and that requires a little navel-gazing. </p> <p>\"Do an MOT on yourself before you start applying and make it a continuous process,\" she suggests. \"Ask yourself why you're attracted by certain jobs, what your motivations are, why you're applying to particular organisations in certain industries? Do you want to earn lots of money? Are you prepared to work long hours at the cost of your social life? Will you really be happy in a large organisation or would you feel more at home in a small, intimate environment?\" </p> <p>Next, says Lawrence Wilson, director of careers and student development at Canterbury, Christchurch, thoroughly research the industry and organisations that attract you. Be realistic - some sectors, particularly creative ones, won't pay the average graduate starting-salary, so waiting for the perfect job with the perfect package may be a waste of time. Read up about your chosen sector and company, in newspapers and on the internet and, if possible, try to speak to people who know what the company culture is like.</p> <p>If you get a job interview, use it as an opportunity to observe the company's working environment, the dress-code and stress-levels. But, Lawrence admits, \"For many people, the only way to decide their suitability for a certain job or area is to do it. If you discover you've made a mistake, unless it's so bad that it's making you ill or destroying your confidence, you should give it at least six months so it looks credible on your CV. You won't be trapped in your first job for life - the 40 hours a week, 40 years with the company ethos has long gone - and downsizing has changed the concept of commitment and loyalty within society.\" </p> <p>So, should you take the first job you're offered? \"In general, it's better to be in employment than unemployed - not just from a financial point of view but from a psychological one,\" says Lawrence. </p> <p>\"Working gives you confidence and structure. You should avoid the shock of the dole queue at all costs. If you really can't find the job you want - or have no idea what you want to do - temp for a while, or even do voluntary work.\" </p> <p>One day, perhaps, they'll invent sophisticated computers which can take your genetic code and match it to the industry, company, role and workmates that are best suited to you. </p> <p>Until then, mistakes will continue to be made.

      "body": "<p>No doubt you had some kind of paid employment while you were at university. Maybe you spent the summer holidays delivering pizzas or perhaps you cleaned toilets at the weekends. Whatever you did, it probably wasn't very well paid or all that much fun, but at least you knew it wouldn't be forever. But now you've got your degree and it's time to get serious, the idea of commitment to a full-time, salaried, suit-wearing, \"proper\" job can seem, for some people, kind of scary. </p> <p>If you've got a problem with the c-word, ask yourself why you're frightened, says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. \"Is it because you don't want to be controlled or is it because you like being independent? </p> <p>\"Are you afraid of competing? Perhaps you don't like the thought of being swallowed up by corporate culture? You must try to work out where the fear's coming from. If, for example, you're nervous about being swallowed up by a large organisation, you might actually find it's nothing like you imagined.\" </p> <p>But more importantly, Professor Cooper stresses that these days, your employer is unlikely to have any commitment to you either, so you probably won't be stuck in a job for long, anyway. \"We're into a new era,\" he says. </p> <p>\"We're much more of a short-term contract workforce. Research has shown that people over 55-years old have had, on average, four significant jobs in their lives whereas people under 30 have already had four significant jobs. And I think that trend will continue. </p> <p>\"Even young people know that you no longer have a job for life,\" he carries on. \"The perception is that employers want a lot from their staff but if they don't need you any more, they'll get rid of you. People feel the psychological contract between employer and employee has been broken.\" </p> <p>Julie Hoolihan, for example, left art college in the late 1980s. \"I've had hundreds of jobs but only two of them have been permanent,\" she explains. \"It's just how it's worked out. After I graduated, I did some waitressing, then I got a Christmas job in M&amp;S. After that, I temped until I got a permanent job as a graphic designer but I left that to go travelling. </p> <p>\"I've done lots of other jobs since then and there were times when I would have liked permanent work but it wasn't always available. Now I work freelance as a designer and after all this time, I think I'd be terrified if I was offered a permanent job.\" </p> <p>Given that job-hopping is the way forward whether you like it or not, how can employees make the most of the situation? \"I hate to say it but most people are disposable so it's very important that you look after your own career,\" says Professor Cooper. \"It's not selfish, particularly if you perceive that your employer doesn't value you. </p> <p>Of course, if you're working for a good brand name, the job fits and you can see a clear career progression, then you should definitely consider staying. </p> <p>\"I would advise recent graduates to get a job somewhere where they can learn,\" says Cooper. \"Whatever job you take, take whatever training is offered to you. Young graduates should also network. Join the professional association that's relevant to your job and go to the meetings. It's very important that you meet your professional peer group. You might hear of vacancies in other organisations but you can also learn about things that other people are doing which you could introduce into your own company and make your job more bearable.\" </p> <p><strong>If you don't remember anything else...</strong> </p> <p>If 40 years of faithful service and a gold clock are not for you, you've never been better positioned to create the kind of career you want. \"There's a lot of flexibility around these days,\" says Professor Cooper. \"If you're frightened of commitment for positive reasons, because you like freedom and independence, then why commit? </p> <p>\"Take a job and if you don't like it, ask to go part-time. Ask to work on a contract basis. Until now, freelance or contract work has usually been done by older, more experienced people. But I think it might spread to a younger workforce.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "No doubt you had some kind of paid employment while you were at university. Maybe you spent the summer holidays delivering pizzas or perhaps you cleaned toilets at the weekends. Whatever you did, it probably wasn't very well paid or all that much fun, but at least you knew it wouldn't be forever. But now you've got your degree and it's time to get serious, the idea of commitment to a full-time, salaried, suit-wearing, \"proper\" job can seem, for some people, kind of scary. If you've got a problem with the c-word, ask yourself why you're frightened, says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. \"Is it because you don't want to be controlled or is it because you like being independent? \"Are you afraid of competing? Perhaps you don't like the thought of being swallowed up by corporate culture? You must try to work out where the fear's coming from. If, for example, you're nervous about being swallowed up by a large organisation, you might actually find it's nothing like you imagined.\" But more importantly, Professor Cooper stresses that these days, your employer is unlikely to have any commitment to you either, so you probably won't be stuck in a job for long, anyway. \"We're into a new era,\" he says. \"We're much more of a short-term contract workforce. Research has shown that people over 55-years old have had, on average, four significant jobs in their lives whereas people under 30 have already had four significant jobs. And I think that trend will continue. \"Even young people know that you no longer have a job for life,\" he carries on. \"The perception is that employers want a lot from their staff but if they don't need you any more, they'll get rid of you. People feel the psychological contract between employer and employee has been broken.\" Julie Hoolihan, for example, left art college in the late 1980s. \"I've had hundreds of jobs but only two of them have been permanent,\" she explains. \"It's just how it's worked out. After I graduated, I did some waitressing, then I got a Christmas job in M&amp;S. After that, I temped until I got a permanent job as a graphic designer but I left that to go travelling. \"I've done lots of other jobs since then and there were times when I would have liked permanent work but it wasn't always available. Now I work freelance as a designer and after all this time, I think I'd be terrified if I was offered a permanent job.\" Given that job-hopping is the way forward whether you like it or not, how can employees make the most of the situation? \"I hate to say it but most people are disposable so it's very important that you look after your own career,\" says Professor Cooper. \"It's not selfish, particularly if you perceive that your employer doesn't value you. Of course, if you're working for a good brand name, the job fits and you can see a clear career progression, then you should definitely consider staying. \"I would advise recent graduates to get a job somewhere where they can learn,\" says Cooper. \"Whatever job you take, take whatever training is offered to you. Young graduates should also network. Join the professional association that's relevant to your job and go to the meetings. It's very important that you meet your professional peer group. You might hear of vacancies in other organisations but you can also learn about things that other people are doing which you could introduce into your own company and make your job more bearable.\" If you don't remember anything else... If 40 years of faithful service and a gold clock are not for you, you've never been better positioned to create the kind of career you want. \"There's a lot of flexibility around these days,\" says Professor Cooper. \"If you're frightened of commitment for positive reasons, because you like freedom and independence, then why commit? \"Take a job and if you don't like it, ask to go part-time. Ask to work on a contract basis. Until now, freelance or contract work has usually been done by older, more experienced people. But I think it might spread to a younger workforce.\"",

      "body": "<p>Competition in the credit card market hotted up further this week with newcomer Thomas Cook cutting its rate for balance transfers to one of the lowest on the market, and American Express adding benefits to its green charge card. </p> <p>Travel agent Thomas Cook has signed up more than 10,000 customers since launching its own-brand card in April, and hopes to recruit many more by reducing its introductory annual percentage rate (APR) on balance transfers from 3.9 to 2.9, shaving its rate for purchases from 16.9 to 15.9, and adding a cashback facility for people who use the card to buy their holiday at Thomas Cook. </p> <p>The special offer balance transfer rate lasts for six months - after that it reverts to 15.9 APR. The cashback scheme will give those who book their holiday at the travel agent money back at the rate of 0.5% for up to \u00a32,000 spent and 1% back for \u00a32,000-plus, though this is taken straight off their credit card bill. The card already has a loyalty scheme where customers earn between 0.5% and 2% back in the form of Thomas Cook \"travel pounds,\" which can be redeemed against travel purchases made in its branches. </p> <p>This week also saw American Express sign a deal with online retailer <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">Lastminute.com</a> to offer \"exclusive\" late deals and special offers to its army of green charge card holders. The link-up is part of a multi-million pound revamp of the card. The deals and offers will range from \"experiences\", such as learning to race a power boat or taking a tiger moth flight, to book ing holidays and concert tickets. Card-holders can find out more by logging on to the new Amex website: <br><a href=\"http://www.americanexpress.co.uk/green\">www.americanexpress.co.uk/green</a> </p> <p>The two announcements came hot on the heels of the launch of a new credit card from Capital One with an APR for purchases of zero for the first six months. After that it reverts to 12.9 APR. And for cardholders transferring balances in the first six months, Capital One is offering a lifetime rate of 7.9 APR on the amount transferred. </p> <p>However, research from the company illustrates the challenge it and other newcomers face in persuading the public to ditch their less competitive plastic and sign up for their cards. Its survey found that only one in 10 of us are happy with our current card - but 58% of people would still think twice about changing to a card with a lower rate. When asked why, the most common reason given was that they \"couldn't be bothered,\" says Capital One, which has calculated that inertia is costing UK cardholders billions of pounds. </p> <p>Capital One's offer was slightly overshadowed by a row over the way it, and many other companies, calculate interest. It's common practice in the UK that if an individual has chunks of debt on their card coming from both balance transfers and purchases, what tends to happen is that the interest accumulated on purchases gets paid off after the interest on balance transfers. This effectively means that the more expensive debt is paid last and the cheaper debt is paid first, which clearly isn't beneficial to consumers. Capital One says it is not alone in operating such a system and adds that it has started a review of its charging regime which could result in changes being made. </p> <p>This week also saw Abbey National's internet bank, Cahoot, rated number one in a survey of internet credit cards.

      "bodyText": "Competition in the credit card market hotted up further this week with newcomer Thomas Cook cutting its rate for balance transfers to one of the lowest on the market, and American Express adding benefits to its green charge card. Travel agent Thomas Cook has signed up more than 10,000 customers since launching its own-brand card in April, and hopes to recruit many more by reducing its introductory annual percentage rate (APR) on balance transfers from 3.9 to 2.9, shaving its rate for purchases from 16.9 to 15.9, and adding a cashback facility for people who use the card to buy their holiday at Thomas Cook. The special offer balance transfer rate lasts for six months - after that it reverts to 15.9 APR. The cashback scheme will give those who book their holiday at the travel agent money back at the rate of 0.5% for up to \u00a32,000 spent and 1% back for \u00a32,000-plus, though this is taken straight off their credit card bill. The card already has a loyalty scheme where customers earn between 0.5% and 2% back in the form of Thomas Cook \"travel pounds,\" which can be redeemed against travel purchases made in its branches. This week also saw American Express sign a deal with online retailer Lastminute.com to offer \"exclusive\" late deals and special offers to its army of green charge card holders. The link-up is part of a multi-million pound revamp of the card. The deals and offers will range from \"experiences\", such as learning to race a power boat or taking a tiger moth flight, to book ing holidays and concert tickets. Card-holders can find out more by logging on to the new Amex website: www.americanexpress.co.uk/green The two announcements came hot on the heels of the launch of a new credit card from Capital One with an APR for purchases of zero for the first six months. After that it reverts to 12.9 APR. And for cardholders transferring balances in the first six months, Capital One is offering a lifetime rate of 7.9 APR on the amount transferred. However, research from the company illustrates the challenge it and other newcomers face in persuading the public to ditch their less competitive plastic and sign up for their cards. Its survey found that only one in 10 of us are happy with our current card - but 58% of people would still think twice about changing to a card with a lower rate. When asked why, the most common reason given was that they \"couldn't be bothered,\" says Capital One, which has calculated that inertia is costing UK cardholders billions of pounds. Capital One's offer was slightly overshadowed by a row over the way it, and many other companies, calculate interest. It's common practice in the UK that if an individual has chunks of debt on their card coming from both balance transfers and purchases, what tends to happen is that the interest accumulated on purchases gets paid off after the interest on balance transfers. This effectively means that the more expensive debt is paid last and the cheaper debt is paid first, which clearly isn't beneficial to consumers. Capital One says it is not alone in operating such a system and adds that it has started a review of its charging regime which could result in changes being made. This week also saw Abbey National's internet bank, Cahoot, rated number one in a survey of internet credit cards. Gomez, a company which rates online offerings, said that out of the nine internet credit card issuers it looked at, Cahoot topped its league table, followed by Egg and Smile, the Co-op Bank's online bank. A spokesman for Gomez says its league tables \"will ensure that consumers make informed decisions before signing up with an internet credit card service\".

Crete is ideal for late-October sunshine. A week in one of Sunvil's (020-8568 4499) apartment complexes with pool, 15 minutes' walk from Kalives in western Crete, costs from \u00a3349pp based on a family of four, including flights. The temperature in north-eastern Corfu reaches the low 70s by lunchtime, and al-fresco evening meals are still possible, although you may need a light sweater. Strongilo Villa from CV Travel (0870 606 0013) is on the hillside between St Stephano and Kerasia, has three bedrooms, a pool and fantastic views, and costs \u00a3365pp for the week based on a family of four. Another CV villa, Anassa, up behind Kassiopi, sleeps 10 and would be perfect for two families or a group of friends, offering oceans of space and a pool. It costs \u00a3360pp for a week based on eight sharing.

There's no easier route to an activity-based family break than an all-inclusive club holiday. Club Med (0700 2582633) has space at two family holiday villages during half term. The Ibiza village welcomes children of all ages and costs \u00a31,894 for a family of four for the week starting October 22, including full board with wine, most activities and children's clubs from four years. Kamarina in Sicily is similarly family-friendly. The same deal, same week, costs \u00a31,802. Malta's smaller, quieter sister, Gozo, has a spectacular rocky coastline, ancient hill top villages and steep inland valleys. It's a perfect island for gentle family walking, which Headwater Holidays (01606 813367) combines with plenty of relaxation. Its independent walking holiday is based at the five-star Ta'Cenc hotel with air-conditioned stone bungalows, two enormous pools, tennis courts and a private beach. The price for the week starting October 21 is \u00a3736 per adult, \u00a3496 for children under 12, including flights, helicopter transfers, and seven nights' half-board with five-course dinners. Half-term demand has prompted Cadogan (023- 808 28313) to arrange nearly 1,000 additional charter seats to Tunisia. A week's half-board in a three-star hotel in Monastir costs \u00a3517pp, a four-star in Hammamet from \u00a3594. Sailing Several yachting companies still have berths on boats or beds ashore until mid-November. You can charter a bareboat yacht or join a flotilla with Sunsail (02392 222222) from Palma in the Balearics or St Raphael in the Cte d'Azur from \u00a3449pp based on four sharing a 30ft yacht (larger vessels also available). If not all the family is keen on sailing, you may prefer Sunsail's Club holidays. All the Med Clubs are now full, but a week at Club Colonna in Antigua costs \u00a3695pp, two weeks \u00a3995. A week's Caribbean yacht charter costs from \u00a3549pp based on four in a 32ft boat. Portugal The Waterside Village Beachfront Apartments, part of the Luz Ocean Club Complex at Praia da Luz on the Algarve, have three pools and a five-court tennis centre with tuition available. One week with Sovereign (08705 768373) costs \u00a31,477 for a family of four including villa, car hire and flights. France Children are welcome to help out with the chickens, ducks and geese in a three-bedroomed gte near Dol de Bretagne in Brittany, reference B12288 in the Brittany Ferries programme (08705 360360). A week starts at \u00a369pp based on five sharing. Similarly, a two-bedroom cottage (ref BM5219) sleeping four near Ploermel, also in Brittany, with a large garden and free rental of bicycles, starts at \u00a392pp. Both prices include ferry crossings to St Malo with Brittany Ferries. Spooky goings on are guaranteed at Disneyland Paris where the Halloween celebration will be in full swing. Frontierland, will be transformed into a ghost town of Halloweenland, with scarecrows and skeletons at every turn. As well as the nightly Halloween parade, children can enjoy a traditional Trick or Treat sweet hunt, or take part in face-painting, pumpkin sculpting, and costume- and mask-making workshops. Special tickets for extra-spooky Halloween parties on the evenings of October 27 and 28 are available to guests booking Halloween packages. A two-night Classic Package staying at Disney's Newport Bay Club starts at \u00a3281 per adult, \u00a3114 per child in a family room, with B&amp;B, direct travel on Eurostar and unlimited access to the park. Details from Disneyland Paris (08705 030303). Italy Castellare di Tonda, in the heart of Tuscany, is a wine estate with 10 houses widely scattered among the olive trees and cypresses. There's plenty to do on the estate in the autumn sunshine, with tennis courts, mountain bikes, waymarked footpaths and a weekly guided walk. There's also a restaurant, bar and shop on site selling chianti and olive oil. A four-person apartment for the week from October 21 costs \u00a3245 per adult (children free), self-drive with Inntravel (01653 629010). Holland As one of the most compact, lived-in and traffic-free capitals of Europe, Amsterdam is built on a scale that works well for kids. The Saturday-morning farmers' gathering in the Jordaan, the New Metropolis science museum and Anne Frank's house can all be followed by a visit to a crafty little toy shop called Bell Tree and supper at the Pancake Bakery. Then there's a Puppet Theatre held on Dam Square on Wednesday afternoons, bikes for hire and museums and galleries galore. But the biggest Dutch treat is the Kinderkookkafe, where children prepare and cook the food, serve drinks from the bar, wait on tables and present you with a bill at the end (book in advance on 0031 20 625 3257). Two nights in a two-star hotel with Amsterdam Travel Service (01992 456056) costs \u00a3199pp with flights, with longer holidays and self-drive/Eurostar combinations also available. Middle East The Hilton Dubai Jumeira, beside a white sandy beach, has everything for parents and children, including a health club, gym, kids club, pool, watersports and several restaurants. Golf, desert-dune safaris, scuba diving and dhow cruises can be easily arranged. A week's B&amp;B with Classic Connection (0870 7519320) in a deluxe sea-view room for a family of four costs \u00a35,043 in half term. Oman is another hot possibility. Seven nights with Arabian Odyssey (01242 224482) at the four-star Plaza Hotel in Muscat, overlooking sandy Mina Al Fahl beach with the Hajar mountains behind, costs \u00a3815 per adult, \u00a3312 per child sharing the room, including flights and B&amp;B. And at home . . . Don't dismiss Britain, now dressed in autumnal browns and golds. Take advantage of this seasonal magnificence in a self-catering cottage - all the major agencies have a few vacancies left on their books. For a full listing of companies and personally-visited properties, pick up a copy of The Good Holiday Cottage Guide 2000 - Britain and Ireland (Swallow Press, \u00a35.95).

      "body": "<p>Trees, fast streets, tango and meat sum up Buenos Aires. The streets are European - shaped at the turn of the century by a wave of immigrants, including seven million Italians. Narrow Italian streets and wide Parisian boulevards were filled with lilac blooms of feathery jacarandas and pink-flowered palo borracho, \"drunken stick\", whose tall bottle-shaped trunks lurch drunkenly in Palermo Park, amid lakes, Japanese gardens and dog walkers. </p> <p>The venerable Hotel Bristol was our home, right by The Obelisk, on Avenida 9 July, the world's widest boulevard, which was modelled on the Champs Elys\u00e9es but is bigger. Crossing the 20 lanes was a daily challenge. A good stride would get us three-quarters of the way across, racing the blinking red man. The cars and bikers, with their helmets hanging over their arms, would be straining at the leash for the off. </p> <p>To feel the true headlong rush, take the colectivos, buses that race around the city carving up everybody. We regularly hurtled over to the peeling streets of San Telmo for the Sunday market, and to relish the spot on Defensa where in 1807 the locals, porte\u00f1os, chased out the invading English with boiling oil. Plaza Dorrego was full, the sun burned down and tango dancers arched and twisted for the crowds. Tourists sweated and bought gaucho and tango memorabilia. </p> <p>We ate meat regularly in El Viejo Bazar, one of a thousand Buenos Aires parrillas (barbeque grills). Meat, salt and fire, very simple, and tops anything you know. You can taste the grass, for that is all the animal has eaten. No hormones and no antibiotics. Every cut of beef tastes different. We would start with matambrito, \"hunger killer\", a tasty flank to chew on while deciding what meat to eat next - steaks and ribs, sweetbreads and black pudding. The meat is so succulent that vegetables seem an irrelevance. Grilled peppers are an exception. </p> <p>My favourite haunt was La Estancia (Lavalle 941), where a meal costs $20-$25 a head with wine. Two rent-a-gauchos sweat over a big fire with ribs and goats on spits. Inside, the walls are covered with exuberant murals of gauchos on the ranch rounding up happy steers. Gloomy-looking waiters brought good wine and mountains of hot meat. Twelve hundred people stuff themselves silly late every Saturday night. When we left after midnight, grannies and their grandchildren were still pouring in to eat more meat. Be brave and try the offal: the black pudding is smooth and fine, the mollejas (thyroid sweetbreads) are sweet and rich, and chinchulines (intestines) are delicious if cooked very crispy. Trust me. I am a doctor with a high cholesterol count. </p> <p>Spettus (Avenida Alicia Moreau de Justo 876) is smart and stylish, with London prices by night, but a staggering $15 all-you-can-eat lunch that's hard to recover from. Darkly handsome tango waiters come round with various meats on long skewers. An astonishing salad bar taunts you. Flan and dulce de leche, Argentina's caramelised condensed milk, is the sweet treat. </p> <p>In the end, there isn't a bad restaurant in Buenos Aires. As you get sucked deeper into meat addiction, your pulses quicken every time you see the sign \"Parrilla\". Go with it, you can't go wrong. After all the themed holidays - trekking, fishing and the rest - there's an argument for a meat-eating holiday in Argentina. Do yourself a favour, fly to Buenos Aires and just eat meat for two weeks. </p> <p>But tango is the lifeblood of Buenos Aires, which even has a 24-hour FM tango station. It's in the air, old-fashioned music that won't go away. Carlos Gardel is the porte\u00f1os' favourite son, the personification of tango. He came from the back streets, wrote and sang impassioned tangos, and was laughably handsome. He had a seductive smile. He died in 1935 in a plane crash, but his records still fill the music shops. They say, \"Carlitos is singing better and better every day.\" It's true. Visit his grave and believe. </p> <p>The taxi driver sped down Chacarita cemetery to Gardel's corner. There stands a lifelike bronze Carlitos in his tuxedo, hair slicked back, smiling, with red flowers stuck in his crooked arm and a cigarette inserted by loving fans between his fingers. Two old men were repainting the tomb downstairs. \"You want to see Carlitos?\" I went down and touched a massive mahogany coffin with a wooden rail and solid silver handles. Underneath was a smaller coffin for his mother. After living with her all his life, Carlitos has come back to mama. </p> <p>We took the Subte to Carlos Gardel, to walk in the Abasto, Carlitos' run-down barrio. His and his mum's little house was wrapped in corrugated iron, ripe for restoration. Gardel Alley was a hive of activity. Tomorrow, a statue of the \"Creole Thrush\" would be unveiled. Tango would be sung. Down the alley boys finished spray-can pictures of the famous smile. Carlos looked impressive and spooky wrapped up in his shroud like a body about to be offered to the sea. </p> <p>Played by true \"tangueros\", tango is dark, dangerous music. Hear Ruben Juarez at Club Homero (Cabrera 4946; $30 cover charge per person). Standing with his foot on a chair, his bandoneon - the big black German concertina that is the plaintive sound of tango - on his knee, he hunches over singing, sweat dripping from his forehead. He battles with his bandoneon , stretching and squeezing it and beating it against his knee. He has more passion than is medically safe. </p> <p>It is not surprising that tango clubs should feel like New York jazz clubs in the 1950s. Jazz and tango both came from brothels and low life, booze and drugs. Other great players? Sexto Mayor with Nestor Marconi. In March, Buenos Aires had a tango conference packed with devotees from all over the world. Delegates tangoed in the salons for 10 hours a day, retiring to their hotels to put their feet in ice. Not everyone tangoes, though. It is still vulgar and lowlife, and, even now, smart young porte\u00f1as can dance the Gay Gordons but can't tango. </p> <p>In La Boca, the garish painted port area, people tango regularly in the streets. Some of the raucous canteens on Necochea still pump out loud tango. Full of tourists, Caminito's gaudy pastel walls are worth seeing. The port itself is a graveyard, rotting hulks entombed in a mattress of diesel sludge. If you want to visit this funky waterside setting and still pay London prices, go to Patagonia Sur, an intimate and expensive restaurant serving delicious Argentine-French nouvelle cuisine with large portions and bills. </p> <p> Despite the urban sprawl, an hour or two from the heart of Buenos Aires can see you riding over the pampa. San Antonio de Areco was the frontier between the capital and the unknown. Its bridge was the toll bridge to the interior and the Indians. Now it is a ranching town and the centre of the cattle culture that built Buenos Aires, out here because the city mistrusts the gaucho, symbol of Argentina more than the cowboy is to America. Every November, they hold the nation's biggest gaucho celebration here. </p> <p>Ricardo Guiraldes from Areco wrote Don Segundo Sombra, a dreamlike rites of passage into gaucho life. Before the whirlwind success of Don Segundo, Guiraldes' work brought critical scorn. I went to his estancia, La Porte\u00f1a, to see the well where he had jettisoned his earlier books. Some have been saved and are on show in the excellent museum (Museo Gauchesco Ricardo Guiraldes, tel: 0054 02326 455990, admisssion $3). </p> <p>As well as gauchesque art and memorabilia, they have Walter Owen's manuscript of his translation of the epic gaucho poem Martin Fierro. This is the world epicentre of cowboy literature. </p> <p>Areco silversmiths like Juan Draghi make exquisite silver and gold daggers, stirrups, bridles and mat\u00e9s, for the wealthy horseman with gaucho yearnings. Cowboys have a passion for flash, but gauchos lead the pack. They wear a rastra , a wide belt clanking with silver and gold dollars, chains, horses, flowers, eagles. Stuck in the back is their facon , an all-purpose knife, ornamented with cattle and flowers. Draghi's mat\u00e9s and bombillas for drinking mat\u00e9 tea are richly embellished with leaves and flowers. It is an ostentatious art, tasteful in its vulgarity. </p> <p>Many estancias like Guiraldes' La Porte\u00f1a take guests. We stayed at La Bamba (c/o Ricardo Aldao, tel/fax: 0054 02326 456293, <a href=\"http://www.la-bamba.com.ar\">www.la-bamba.com.ar</a>), with wonderful old colonial rooms and a story-book terrace. Romantic and unruffled, indulged after the mad pace of Buenos Aires. A siesta after lunch, a ride out on the pampa afterwards. Expensive at $260 a night for a double room with full board, but heaven. Great for honeymooners. You can even do a daytrip, go to the museum and visit an estancia for an afternoon ride. </p> <p>We took a bus pilgrimage to Lujan. The Historic Museum has more gaucho and colonial history. In the Transport Museum (tel: 0054 02323 420245, admission $2, open Wed - Sun noon to 6pm), we saw the stuffed carcasses of Mancha and Gato, the horses who walked Tschiffely's Ride. Their transcontinental journey from BA to Washington was a legendary 1930s true-life adventure. Now two heroic horses, saddled up forever, stare blankly with glass eyes out of their glass case. </p> <p>The cathedral's gothic spires modelled on St Pancras station, incongruously rising out of the pampa, shelter the miraculous Virgin of Lujan. Outside, in deference to Her, a sign says \"No Shorts! and No Cameras!\" Inside, at the head of a long queue, pilgrims in shorts are being photographed prostrating themselves in front of the miraculous Virgin. She is Argentina's Guadalupe, her most important Virgin. Her miracle was to get stuck here and refuse to move from this spot. With perfect irony, she is the patron saint of Argentina's moribund railways. </p> <p> <strong> The practicals</strong></p> <p>Hank Wangford flew to Buenos Aires with British Airways (0345 222111), which offers return fares from \u00a3445 + \u00a347.50 tax for a minimum stay of seven days. He stayed at the Hotel Bristol (tel: 00 5411 43825400, fax: 43823284, <a href=\"http://www.hotelbristol.com.ar\">www.hotelbristol.com.ar</a>, e-mail: reservas@hotel bristol.com.ar), where a room costs $75 for a single, $90 for a double.

There are quite a few of these here, outside Penrith in Cumbria, and it's not immediately clear why this one should be any different - until our car swings round a concealed bend and draws up beside a pair of heavy brown doors set into the hillside. They glide open in the manner of the top-secret lair of a movie villain bent on world domination. </p> <p>As it happens, the ambitions of the newly-opened Rheged Discovery Centre, which lies behind the doors, don't quite run to world domination. This vast underground visitor attraction - the largest earth-covered building in England - has a more modest aim, but one that may prove equally tricky: to break the stranglehold on Cumbrian tourism of the honeypots of Windermere, Ambleside and Grasmere - the traditional Lake District haunts crammed with traffic jams and Beatrix Potter merchandise. </p> <p>The strange, dark beauty of the cloud-shrouded crags and fells of northern Cumbria has had a bad press ever since Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins made a disastrous journey up Carrock Fell in 1871 (Dickens moaned about the views, while Collins sprained his ankle and sulked for the rest of the trip). The \u00a315m Rheged complex is an unashamedly populist attempt to set things right. </p> <p>It will find few friends among those devotees of the region who would be quite happy for it to remain neglected and unvisited. For everyone else, Rheged offers a \"visitor experience\" centred on a vast, Imax-sized cinema screen which slices through six of the building's seven levels, complemented by numerous themed exhibitions, shops and workshops selling local goods, an excellent restaurant with a menu by leading northern chef Paul Heathcote, a caf\u00e9 and a bar. </p> <p>Rheged is worth a visit for the architecture alone. Heated entirely by the surrounding earth, the building is lit by pillars of light from a series of atriums hidden in the grass above. The main large-screen film is rather less satisfying: a cheesy trawl through the region's Celtic mythology - something about a gipsy girl and an ancient king and a mysterious talisman, although I lost track of the plot long before half way. </p> <p>Nevertheless, in providing a much-needed introduction to the northern crags and fells, Rheged has done the region a service - just as long as it doesn't prove too popular and threaten their appealing emptiness. </p> <p>Either way, it is worth arranging a visit to northern Cumbria in haste. The town of Keswick serves as a good springboard to the two most alluring areas of rugged countryside - Skiddaw and Bassenthwaite Lake, and the fells beyond known locally as the Back o' Skiddaw. </p> <p> <strong> Details </strong> Rheged Discovery Centre, Redhills, Penrith, Cumbria CA11 0DQ (tel 01768 868000, <a href=\"http://www.rheged.com\">www.rheged.com</a>) is open 10am-6pm daily, adults \u00a34.95, children \u00a33.50. </p> <p> The picturesque market town that serves the northern fells' major population positively heaves with decent pubs and tea-rooms, and it's easy to spend a day here only emerging from one to visit another. But it really is also worth suppressing one's cynicism for a visit to the much-mocked Cumberland Pencil Museum (017687 73626). </p> <p>The world's largest pencil may be strangely anticlimactic at only 6ft, but the story of the discovery and exploitation of graphite in these hills and the subsequent collapse of the industries built upon it is told with a verve rare in traditional museums.

It is actually the description of the route taken by the \"comely knight\" Sir Gawain to his fateful rendezvous in the 14th-century alliterative poem, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. </p> <p>A painstaking essay in literary geography by Professor Ralph Elliott of Keele University in 1958 firmly placed the scene of that monumental encounter in the Roaches area of the Staffordshire moorlands, which get their name from the Norman-French \"roches\", or rocks. </p> <p>Amazingly, you can still follow Gawain's route to the scene of the poem's dramatic denouement through the National Park's Roaches estate, east of Leek. </p> <p>The route starts between the beetling crags of the Roaches and the isolated outlier of Hen Cloud near Rockhall Cottage. Partly built into the overhanging rocks of the Roaches, Rockhall Cottage is now a well-appointed climbers' bothy, rebuilt in memory of Don Whillans, something of a cult figure from the 1950s \"working-class revolution\" in rock climbing. With others like Joe Brown and equipped with nothing much more than plimsoles and their mother's washing line for a rope, they took the sport to new extremes of boldness and sustained difficulty. </p> <p>Climbs such as the Sloth (named for the amount of time spent suspended upside down), Valkyrie and the Mincer still test the modern rockjocks, and astound passing pedestrians. </p> <p>Rockhall Cottage was originally built as a gamekeepers' hut and for many years was the squalid home of the legendary Dougie Moller, self-styled \"King of the Roaches\". Moller was a thorn in the side of the National Park authority and became the anti-establishment hero of the climbing fraternity until he was finally moved out to more salubrious accommodation. </p> <p>The walk makes for the col between the Roaches and Hen Cloud, whose 1,345ft summit looks from here like a miniature Rock of Gibraltar. </p> <p>A gentle scramble brings you to the crest of the Roaches, whose serrated summits, so well seen as you approach the Peak along the A53 Buxton road from Leek, must be the \" . . . great crooked crags, cruelly jagged, the bristling barbs of rock seemed to brush the sky\" seen by Gawain as he sought out the Green Chapel. </p> <p>Here, he was due to face the Green Knight exactly a year after he had perhaps unwisely accepted the challenge for a return match, after beheading him with a well-swung axe at a Christmas feast at Camelot. </p> <p>This part of Staffordshire is as rich in myths and legends as the frequent mists that descend on these spiky summits. There are stories of a headless rider and a tall man dressed in green, which could be folk recollections of the Gawain story. </p> <p>Nearing the 1,675ft summit of the Roaches ridge, with its fine views across the pastoral Staffordshire plain to the glittering mirror of Tittesworth reservoir, you pass the dark, peaty hollow which contains the murky waters of Doxey Pool, said to be the home of Jenny Greenteeth, a seductive mermaid who lures travellers to a watery grave. </p> <p>The way follows a partly-paved path through weirdly-eroded pinkish gritstone tors to the road at Roach End, from where a stile on the left leads down through scrubby birches into a beechy bower marking the entrance to Back Forest. </p> <p>According to the unknown poet, \"wonderfully wild was their way through the woods\" and Gawain and his guide saw \" brooks burst forth above them, boiling over their banks/ And showering down sharply in shimmering cascades\". </p> <p>The description matches perfectly as the path descends to Forest Bottom, through the oaks, pines and beeches of Forest Wood to the dashing waters of the Black Brook, which joins the infant River Dane at Castor's Bridge.

About 50ft deep and some 100 yards long, it is still an unaccountably eerie and mysterious place, whose constantly wet walls drip with mosses, ferns and grasses.

      "body": "<p>I think it was when my girlfriend went haring off down the terraces after Ivan Zamorano that I realised it's easy to get carried away at San Siro. The Chilean centre-forward had just given Internazionale a dream start with a goal after only nine minutes of the crunch game against Lazio. </p> <p>This wasn't my first time at Inter. I had been an occasional visitor for a couple of seasons by then. Why not? It was a weekend away and a different way of watching football. In fact, given that I was born and brought up to devote myself solely to the cause of Liverpool FC, it was rather like sex without the commitment. </p> <p>So, I'd brought Maria to meet my bit on the sidelines, and within minutes here they were, flirting together outrageously. It was all a far cry from 24 hours earlier, at Bar Giamaica, one of Milan's oldest drinking establishments, in the heart of the city's Brera district. Beers in hand, it was clear that Maria was more concerned with planning a mazy run through the main shopping street of Monte Napoleone. </p> <p>Giamaica is one of those reassuringly lived-in places that gives tourists a self-satisfied feeling of having broken away from the well-trodden path around the Duomo and the smart but expensive bars and restaurants that lie in wait for the unsuspecting credit card in the nearby Galleria. </p> <p>Aware that there would be no escape from the commercial equivalent of the passeggiata down Monte Napoleone, I decided lunch in Coccopazzo was in order. The restaurant stands a few doors down from Inter's headquarters on Via Durini, and club officials mix with the usual crowd of those who live to lunch. </p> <p>The entrance to the restaurant opens out into a large room, but it is a regular haunt on my solo excursions because there are enough corners where those who only need a table for one can find refuge from pitying glances. </p> <p>Not surprisingly for a people at the mercy of the temperamental weather that rolls in from the Alps, the Milanese rely on a cuisine with a backbone of sturdy fare. The city is no stranger to l'alta cucina but the real beauty of Italian food is that almost every establishment does the basics very well. Certainly, tortellini in a meat sauce, a huge cotoletta of veal and bottle or two of Lombardian white is ample insulation against the chill that envelops the San Siro on one of those long autumnal nights. </p> <p>After three hours covering every inch of Monte Napoleone, we headed for San Babila station to catch the red Line 1 metropolitana that cuts through the centre of town before heading north to the suburbs and San Siro. One stop in the other direction from San Babila is Piazzale Loreto, where an angry mob strung up the bodies of Benito Mussolini and his mistress in 1945. It was under Il Duce's regime that Inter were forced to change their name to Ambrosiana because the authorities felt Internazionale had too much of a Marxist-Leninist ring to it. </p> <p> On leaving the train at Lotto, rather than getting caught up in the crush, it is best to jump on the last in the line of free buses that ship the supporters, tightly packed, down the tree-lined avenue, past the Ippodromo where Europe's best horses can be seen battling it out over the furlongs, and on to the edge of the concourse that surrounds the stadium itself. A five-minute stop-start passage as the driver negotiated a succession of cars and scooters, the hiss of the opening doors and the entire contents of the orange bus emptied out to be greeted by the stalls selling a myriad of unofficial merchandise and the catering vans stacked high with panini stuffed with cured meat, cheese and chicken escalope. </p> <p>Even on big match nights, when Juventus or the Roman clubs come to town, the sheer breadth of the concourse means there is no feeling of claustrophobia amid the milling crowd, and it is worth taking the time to grab a beer from one of the vans and watch the atmosphere develop around what has to be the most instantly recognisable edifices in European football. Officially called the Giuseppe Meazza, in honour of Inter's greatest player (247 goals in 355 appearances, for the record), San Siro's towering walkways spiral upwards towards the dark-red scaffolding that forms the roof. Beautiful, no; rather it's a beast. </p> <p>The idea of sharing a stadium is alien to most British supporters, but followers of Inter and AC Milan, while not exactly basking in domestic bliss, have given each other enough space to make a home together by claiming opposite ends of the arena. In Inter's case, the Curva Nord, specifically the second ring, is the heart of pre-match rituals involving flares, drums and promptings from the supporters' very own master of ceremonies, who leads the crowd via loudhailer through a familiar songbook expressing in equal measure love for the black-and-blue flag, and hatred of Juve and AC Milan. </p> <p>The tension of the occasion against Lazio was relieved by the vain attempts of the stewards to extinguish flares thrown on to the pitch. The resulting blanket of smog that descended on the two teams as they ran out took a long time to lift, and the first five minutes of action was played in the type of peasouper beloved of Victorian serial killers. But no sooner had the smoke cleared than Zamorano slotted the ball past the Lazio keeper, the stadium erupted and Maria went charging off. </p> <p>I haven't seen her since. Well, not at San Siro anyhow. I don't know why; maybe it was the late equaliser that brought her back down to earth, although sitting in front of a late beer in the Galleria, watching the last of the Scala crowd amble past in their tuxedos, she looked happy enough. </p> <p>With a new season kicking off tomorrow, Maria tells me she will be back. So will I, as a season-ticket holder this time. </p> <p><strong> Where to eat </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Trattoria Milanese </strong> (Via Santa Marta 11, metro Duomo/Cordusio). As the name suggests, it considers itself one of the standard bearers of the city's cuisine, offering risotto with saffron and marrowbone, and casoeula (pork and cabbage stew) among other Lombardian classics. Around \u00a320 a head excluding wine. </p> <p> <strong> Lungolanotte </strong> (Via Ludovico il Moro 133, metro Porta Genova). A relative newcomer, this canalside osteria offers refuge from the crowds that swarm around the Navigli district. Around \u00a315-\u00a320, excluding wine, for dishes according to season, including spaghetti with a ragu of rabbit, and guinea fowl. </p> <p> <strong> Coccopazzo</strong> (Via Durini 24 metro San Babila). Substantial Lombardian fare, plus pizzas. Two courses plus wine and coffee for around \u00a320 a head. </p> <p> <strong> Osteria Del Cinema</strong> (Via Milazzo 9, metro Moscova). An ambitious undertaking on the fringes of Brera, it is set within a multiplex cinema, offering set menus from \u00a312, excluding wine. See an Italian film, improve your language skills and swear never to buy a bowl of popcorn ever again. </p> <p> <strong> Brerino</strong> (Via Arco, off Foro Buonaparte, metro Cairoli/ Lanza). Pre-match pizza and a beer will set you back around \u00a36. </p> <p><strong> Where to drink</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Bar Giamaica</strong> (Via Brera 32 metro Cairoli). Best sampled by staying in the front bar - there is a small dining area in the back. Beer and wine by the glass from around \u00a32.50. </p> <p> <strong> Bar Galleria</strong> (Galleria Vittorio Emmanuele, metro Duomo). Great for people-watching but not cheap. Beer with snack \u00a34, coffee \u00a32, light meal \u00a35. </p> <p> <strong> Tango</strong> (Via Casale 7, metro Porta Genova). Bloody Marys and margharitas (around \u00a34 a time) with Caribbean and Mexican specialties on offer. In the canal district. Open until 2am. </p> <p> <strong> Cantine Isola</strong> (Via Sarpi 30, metro Moscova). North of Parco Sempione. Sample French and Italian wines accompanied by snacks such as meatballs and rice croquettes. Price by the glass dependent on how expensive your taste is. </p> <p> <strong> Fish &amp; Fish</strong> (Via Conca de Naviglio, metro San Agostino). Modern American bar with happy hour (6.30pm-9.30pm), when beer and cocktails start from around \u00a32.50. </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Duomo </strong> (metro Duomo). The third largest cathedral in the world and Milan's most instantly-recognisable landmark, evidenced by the thousands that throng around it every day of the year. Don't miss the rooftop view of the city and the Alps. Visit the museum on the south side (open every day 9.30am-12.30pm, 3pm-6pm; admission \u00a33). </p> <p> <strong> Castello Sforzesco</strong> (Piazza Castello, metro Cairoli). Fortress and home to Milan's main art collection (open daily 9am-1pm, 2pm-5.30pm; free). Walk through the castle's imposing courtyard and out into the expanse o Parco Sempione (open 9am-7pm). </p> <p> <strong> Teatro alla Scala</strong> (Piazza dellla Scala metro Duomo/ Monte Napoleone). Recently restored and housing an exhibition tracing the history of operatic works and personalities that have made it world famous (open 9.30am-noon, 2pm-5.30pm; \u00a32). Recently in the news due to protests over the decision to abolish standing room. Tickets can be bought at <a href=\"http://www.lascala.milano.it\">www.lascala.milano.it</a>. </p> <p> <strong> Cenacolo Vinciano</strong> (The Last Supper). Santa Maria delle Grazie (metro Cadorna). Leonardo da Vinci's depiction of Christ's Last Supper (open Tues-Sat 9am-7pm, Sun and festival days 9am-8pm; \u00a34). </p> <p> <strong> Pinacoteca di Brera</strong> (Via Brera 28 metro Montenapoleone). Housed in a 17th-century palazzo and boasting works by Rembrandt, El Greco and Van Dyck. However, the gallery is primarily devoted to celebrating Lombardian and Venetian art (open Tues-Sun 8.30am-7.15pm, sometimes until 11pm in the summer months; \u00a33). </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong><br> </p> <p> For first-time visitors, <strong> Hotel Garda</strong> (0039 2 66982626) and <strong> Mennini</strong> (0039 2 6690951) have singles for \u00a350 and doubles for \u00a380 and can be found in Via Napo Torriani, just across the square from Stazione Centrale where airport buses pick up and drop off. Alternatively, try <strong> Mercure Relais</strong> (0039 2 66047955, similiar pricing structure), Via Conca Del Naviglio 20, which is close to the restaurants and bars of the canal district. In Brera, <strong> Antica Locanda Solferino</strong> (0039 2 6570129, Via Castelfidardo) is a 19th-century inn. There must be something good about it, because they're always fully booked. On the web, <a href=\"http://www.venere.it\">www.venere.it</a> has a good range of Milan hotels. </p> <p> <strong>Buying tickets </strong> </p> <p> Tickets for games involving Inter and AC Milan can be bought through <a href=\"http://www.ticketweb.it\">www.ticketweb.it</a>, and cost from \u00a320 plus commission fee. The agency can either send the tickets via UPS or you can pick them up from its office on Via Cappuccini 11, open Tuesday to Saturday 10am-6pm. </p> <p>A number of other Serie A teams sell tickets over the net, including the champions Lazio (<a href=\"http://www.sslazio.it\">www.sslazio.it</a>), but not Juventus, which only lists authorised vendors in and around Turin and other Italian cities. Tickets for San Siro (right) can also be bought in Milan from authorised news vendors and caf\u00e9s but for the big games it is advisable to pre-book. </p> <p>Don't buy from the touts that greet you at Lotto station - if the tickets are genuine, they will generally be for the third tier (not a place for those with vertigo). </p> <p>Remember that matches are often rescheduled due to TV/European commitments - the Italian football league (<a href=\"http://www.legacalcio.it\">www.legacalcio.it</a>) publishes fixture times including any rescheduling two weeks prior to each round of championship matches. Alternatively, book your flights to cover either the match being brought forward to Saturday night or back to Sunday night. </p> <p>Tickets are included in the two-night Italian football packages to Milan and Rome run by Italiatour (01883 621900), including Oct 14/15 Inter v Napoli, Oct 21/22 AC Milan v Juventus. A stay in a three-star hotel costs \u00a3379, four-star \u00a3405. </p> <p>Travelscene Specialist Sales (0870 7774445) can organise tickets for any Italian matches played in one of its featured cities (Rome, Venice, Florence, Milan, Turin). To calculate the cost of a break, take the package price for each city and add \u00a370 for a ticket. Thus Milan on October 22 for the AC v Juventus or on November 1 for Inter v Roma would be \u00a3247pp (lead price)+ \u00a370 ticket. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p>Both the main budget airlines out of Stansted, Go (<a href=\"http://www.go-fly.com\">www.go-fly.com</a>) and Buzz (<a href=\"http://www.buzzaway.com\">www.buzzaway.com</a>), fly to Milan from around \u00a390 return. Go flies to both Malpensa (50 minutes out of town (bus L13,000 to either Stazione Centrale or Piazza Castello) and Linate (on the outskirts of the city, bus ticket L5,000 one-way, 20 minutes to centre). Buzz only flies to Linate. Milan tourist office: Via Marconi 1 ( opposite the Duomo).</p>",

It was all a far cry from 24 hours earlier, at Bar Giamaica, one of Milan's oldest drinking establishments, in the heart of the city's Brera district. Beers in hand, it was clear that Maria was more concerned with planning a mazy run through the main shopping street of Monte Napoleone. Giamaica is one of those reassuringly lived-in places that gives tourists a self-satisfied feeling of having broken away from the well-trodden path around the Duomo and the smart but expensive bars and restaurants that lie in wait for the unsuspecting credit card in the nearby Galleria. Aware that there would be no escape from the commercial equivalent of the passeggiata down Monte Napoleone, I decided lunch in Coccopazzo was in order. The restaurant stands a few doors down from Inter's headquarters on Via Durini, and club officials mix with the usual crowd of those who live to lunch. The entrance to the restaurant opens out into a large room, but it is a regular haunt on my solo excursions because there are enough corners where those who only need a table for one can find refuge from pitying glances. Not surprisingly for a people at the mercy of the temperamental weather that rolls in from the Alps, the Milanese rely on a cuisine with a backbone of sturdy fare. The city is no stranger to l'alta cucina but the real beauty of Italian food is that almost every establishment does the basics very well. Certainly, tortellini in a meat sauce, a huge cotoletta of veal and bottle or two of Lombardian white is ample insulation against the chill that envelops the San Siro on one of those long autumnal nights. After three hours covering every inch of Monte Napoleone, we headed for San Babila station to catch the red Line 1 metropolitana that cuts through the centre of town before heading north to the suburbs and San Siro. One stop in the other direction from San Babila is Piazzale Loreto, where an angry mob strung up the bodies of Benito Mussolini and his mistress in 1945. It was under Il Duce's regime that Inter were forced to change their name to Ambrosiana because the authorities felt Internazionale had too much of a Marxist-Leninist ring to it. On leaving the train at Lotto, rather than getting caught up in the crush, it is best to jump on the last in the line of free buses that ship the supporters, tightly packed, down the tree-lined avenue, past the Ippodromo where Europe's best horses can be seen battling it out over the furlongs, and on to the edge of the concourse that surrounds the stadium itself. A five-minute stop-start passage as the driver negotiated a succession of cars and scooters, the hiss of the opening doors and the entire contents of the orange bus emptied out to be greeted by the stalls selling a myriad of unofficial merchandise and the catering vans stacked high with panini stuffed with cured meat, cheese and chicken escalope. Even on big match nights, when Juventus or the Roman clubs come to town, the sheer breadth of the concourse means there is no feeling of claustrophobia amid the milling crowd, and it is worth taking the time to grab a beer from one of the vans and watch the atmosphere develop around what has to be the most instantly recognisable edifices in European football. Officially called the Giuseppe Meazza, in honour of Inter's greatest player (247 goals in 355 appearances, for the record), San Siro's towering walkways spiral upwards towards the dark-red scaffolding that forms the roof. Beautiful, no; rather it's a beast. The idea of sharing a stadium is alien to most British supporters, but followers of Inter and AC Milan, while not exactly basking in domestic bliss, have given each other enough space to make a home together by claiming opposite ends of the arena. In Inter's case, the Curva Nord, specifically the second ring, is the heart of pre-match rituals involving flares, drums and promptings from the supporters' very own master of ceremonies, who leads the crowd via loudhailer through a familiar songbook expressing in equal measure love for the black-and-blue flag, and hatred of Juve and AC Milan. The tension of the occasion against Lazio was relieved by the vain attempts of the stewards to extinguish flares thrown on to the pitch. The resulting blanket of smog that descended on the two teams as they ran out took a long time to lift, and the first five minutes of action was played in the type of peasouper beloved of Victorian serial killers. But no sooner had the smoke cleared than Zamorano slotted the ball past the Lazio keeper, the stadium erupted and Maria went charging off. I haven't seen her since. Well, not at San Siro anyhow. I don't know why; maybe it was the late equaliser that brought her back down to earth, although sitting in front of a late beer in the Galleria, watching the last of the Scala crowd amble past in their tuxedos, she looked happy enough. With a new season kicking off tomorrow, Maria tells me she will be back. So will I, as a season-ticket holder this time. Where to eat Trattoria Milanese (Via Santa Marta 11, metro Duomo/Cordusio). As the name suggests, it considers itself one of the standard bearers of the city's cuisine, offering risotto with saffron and marrowbone, and casoeula (pork and cabbage stew) among other Lombardian classics. Around \u00a320 a head excluding wine. Lungolanotte (Via Ludovico il Moro 133, metro Porta Genova). A relative newcomer, this canalside osteria offers refuge from the crowds that swarm around the Navigli district. Around \u00a315-\u00a320, excluding wine, for dishes according to season, including spaghetti with a ragu of rabbit, and guinea fowl. Coccopazzo (Via Durini 24 metro San Babila). Substantial Lombardian fare, plus pizzas. Two courses plus wine and coffee for around \u00a320 a head. Osteria Del Cinema (Via Milazzo 9, metro Moscova). An ambitious undertaking on the fringes of Brera, it is set within a multiplex cinema, offering set menus from \u00a312, excluding wine. See an Italian film, improve your language skills and swear never to buy a bowl of popcorn ever again. Brerino (Via Arco, off Foro Buonaparte, metro Cairoli/ Lanza). Pre-match pizza and a beer will set you back around \u00a36. Where to drink Bar Giamaica (Via Brera 32 metro Cairoli). Best sampled by staying in the front bar - there is a small dining area in the back. Beer and wine by the glass from around \u00a32.50. Bar Galleria (Galleria Vittorio Emmanuele, metro Duomo). Great for people-watching but not cheap. Beer with snack \u00a34, coffee \u00a32, light meal \u00a35. Tango (Via Casale 7, metro Porta Genova). Bloody Marys and margharitas (around \u00a34 a time) with Caribbean and Mexican specialties on offer. In the canal district. Open until 2am. Cantine Isola (Via Sarpi 30, metro Moscova). North of Parco Sempione. Sample French and Italian wines accompanied by snacks such as meatballs and rice croquettes. Price by the glass dependent on how expensive your taste is. Fish &amp; Fish (Via Conca de Naviglio, metro San Agostino). Modern American bar with happy hour (6.30pm-9.30pm), when beer and cocktails start from around \u00a32.50. What to see Duomo (metro Duomo). The third largest cathedral in the world and Milan's most instantly-recognisable landmark, evidenced by the thousands that throng around it every day of the year. Don't miss the rooftop view of the city and the Alps. Visit the museum on the south side (open every day 9.30am-12.30pm, 3pm-6pm; admission \u00a33). Castello Sforzesco (Piazza Castello, metro Cairoli). Fortress and home to Milan's main art collection (open daily 9am-1pm, 2pm-5.30pm; free). Walk through the castle's imposing courtyard and out into the expanse o Parco Sempione (open 9am-7pm). Teatro alla Scala (Piazza dellla Scala metro Duomo/ Monte Napoleone). Recently restored and housing an exhibition tracing the history of operatic works and personalities that have made it world famous (open 9.30am-noon, 2pm-5.30pm; \u00a32). Recently in the news due to protests over the decision to abolish standing room. Tickets can be bought at www.lascala.milano.it. Cenacolo Vinciano (The Last Supper). Santa Maria delle Grazie (metro Cadorna). Leonardo da Vinci's depiction of Christ's Last Supper (open Tues-Sat 9am-7pm, Sun and festival days 9am-8pm; \u00a34). Pinacoteca di Brera (Via Brera 28 metro Montenapoleone). Housed in a 17th-century palazzo and boasting works by Rembrandt, El Greco and Van Dyck. However, the gallery is primarily devoted to celebrating Lombardian and Venetian art (open Tues-Sun 8.30am-7.15pm, sometimes until 11pm in the summer months; \u00a33). Where to stay For first-time visitors, Hotel Garda (0039 2 66982626) and Mennini (0039 2 6690951) have singles for \u00a350 and doubles for \u00a380 and can be found in Via Napo Torriani, just across the square from Stazione Centrale where airport buses pick up and drop off. Alternatively, try Mercure Relais (0039 2 66047955, similiar pricing structure), Via Conca Del Naviglio 20, which is close to the restaurants and bars of the canal district. In Brera, Antica Locanda Solferino (0039 2 6570129, Via Castelfidardo) is a 19th-century inn. There must be something good about it, because they're always fully booked. On the web, www.venere.it has a good range of Milan hotels. Buying tickets Tickets for games involving Inter and AC Milan can be bought through www.ticketweb.it, and cost from \u00a320 plus commission fee. The agency can either send the tickets via UPS or you can pick them up from its office on Via Cappuccini 11, open Tuesday to Saturday 10am-6pm. A number of other Serie A teams sell tickets over the net, including the champions Lazio (www.sslazio.it), but not Juventus, which only lists authorised vendors in and around Turin and other Italian cities. Tickets for San Siro (right) can also be bought in Milan from authorised news vendors and caf\u00e9s but for the big games it is advisable to pre-book. Don't buy from the touts that greet you at Lotto station - if the tickets are genuine, they will generally be for the third tier (not a place for those with vertigo). Remember that matches are often rescheduled due to TV/European commitments - the Italian football league (www.legacalcio.it) publishes fixture times including any rescheduling two weeks prior to each round of championship matches. Alternatively, book your flights to cover either the match being brought forward to Saturday night or back to Sunday night. Tickets are included in the two-night Italian football packages to Milan and Rome run by Italiatour (01883 621900), including Oct 14/15 Inter v Napoli, Oct 21/22 AC Milan v Juventus. A stay in a three-star hotel costs \u00a3379, four-star \u00a3405. Travelscene Specialist Sales (0870 7774445) can organise tickets for any Italian matches played in one of its featured cities (Rome, Venice, Florence, Milan, Turin). To calculate the cost of a break, take the package price for each city and add \u00a370 for a ticket. Thus Milan on October 22 for the AC v Juventus or on November 1 for Inter v Roma would be \u00a3247pp (lead price)+ \u00a370 ticket. The practicals Both the main budget airlines out of Stansted, Go (www.go-fly.com) and Buzz (www.buzzaway.com), fly to Milan from around \u00a390 return. Go flies to both Malpensa (50 minutes out of town (bus L13,000 to either Stazione Centrale or Piazza Castello) and Linate (on the outskirts of the city, bus ticket L5,000 one-way, 20 minutes to centre). Buzz only flies to Linate. Milan tourist office: Via Marconi 1 ( opposite the Duomo).",

      "body": "<p>'I went down to the crossroads/ And fell down on my knees./ Asked the Lord up above: 'Have mercy,/ Save poor Bob if you please'.\" </p> <p>The legend has it that Robert Johnson, the tortured but brilliant blues singer, went down to the crossroads and sold his soul to the devil in exchange for what must have been one of the greatest guitar lessons of all time. The crossroads are where Highways 49 and 61 meet in deepest Mississippi. </p> <p>In African folklore, Esu, guardian of the crossroads, is an intermediary between gods and humans; he must have come over to the cotton plantations in a slave ship, mistaken for the devil. Whatever transpired that dark and steamy night, there's no doubt that this is the home of the blues - devil's music to most white folk of the time. </p> <p>It's not a long ride from Johnson's crossroads, where the dog's still howl at night, the heat is oppressive and the stars shine like the sun flicking off chromed fenders, to the old Stovall Plantation on the edge of Clarksdale. Here you'll still find the ruins of the timber cabin Muddy Waters grew up in. </p> <p>\"Muddy took the music of the Delta plantation,\" says Eric Clapton, \"transplanted it in a Chicago nightclub, surrounded it with an electric band, and changed the course of popular music forever.\" </p> <p>Just about. What's missing from Clapton's mix is the other sounds that Mississippi spawned, which spun together to form rock'n'roll, pop and just about every sound, techno aside, that leaps from radios and stereos worldwide today. </p> <p>There's Clarksdale's other stars, Howlin' Wolf, Son House, John Lee Hooker, Ike Turner and Sam Cooke, but the missing link is Elvis Aron Presley, a white country boy from Mississippi (\"My grandma used to pick cotton alongside Elvis,\" says the check-out clerk in Tupelo's Billion Books store). </p> <p>Elvis, said his first producer Sam Philipps of Sun Records, Memphis, \"sang like a black man\". The two cultures were acceptably joined at a wiggling hip and the records sold like hotcakes. </p> <p>Elvis was born in Tupelo ... </p> <p>\"Tupelo ... Tupelo,/ Everybody's welcome down in Tupelo/ Birthplace of Elvis Presley, the King of rock'n'roll/ The Tupelo symphony will thrill your musical soul/ There's blues and country music, bluegrass and gospel too/ And everybody's listening to good ol' fiddle-tee\" [insert barn- dancing fiddle break here]. </p> <p>That was Buddy and Kay Bain, erstwhile stars of TV's Mornin' with Buddy and Kay. With an oddball gang of Americans and Brits, I went to the Elvis Presley Festival in good ol' Tupelo; we sang this yee-hi song with Kay herself in the parking lot of Estes Fish House on a bellyfull of deep-fried this, that and whaddyagot. No question about it, Tupelo, like much of Mississippi is a friendly place. </p> <p>God knows what lurks behind its big, toothy-grinned smile, but the \"southern welcome\" is real enough. This steamy, underpopulated, agricultural state wandering up from the Gulf of Mexico to the Tennessee River along the mighty Mississippi remains, for many outsiders, the stuff of rednecks and lynching, racism and Mississippi Burning, of gun culture and the Ku Klux Klan. </p> <p>The times, though, are a changing. My Mississippi trail was a hot (95-100F), slow shoe-shuffle through the landscape of the blues and country music, bluegrass and gospel too. And, of course, rock'n'roll. </p> <p>That story begins, as much as it begins anywhere, in good ol' Tupelo. This small, sun-scorched city has been home to the annual Elvis Presley Musical Festival for two years now, attracting something like 35,000 people both times, but, as yet, very few tourists from outside the US, or the Confederacy as I far as I could detect from the accents. </p> <p>\"I ain't got no accent,\" says a local ma-an (ie man, but any word worth its weight in catfish here has more than one syllable). </p> <p>The festival is held, outdoors of course, in the parking lot alongside the hardware store where Elvis's mum, Gladys, brought him his first guitar (the future king of rock'n'roll had asked, as you do in Mississippi, for a gun). And just down the road from the school where, accompanied by that first guitar, Elvis won second prize in a talent competition with a tear-jerking rendition of Ol' Shep, a song about a hound dog. It dies. </p> <p>And we know they cried, because you can't turn a crossroads in Tupelo without being introduced to one of Elvis's old school mates, or Scotty Moore, who played lead guitar on That's Alright Mama back in 1954, Elvis's oldest friend Becky Martin, who invites me home to look at old photos, or Presley cousins galore. Cousin Willy sings a rueful rendition of Blue Moon of Kentucky at Estes Fish House. And who's this down at the town's County Jail to greet us, but none other than Sherriff Harold Ray Presley. </p> <p>You get to meet and hear Elvis impersonators at the festival. Here's Ronnie McDowell backed by Scotty Moore, and Elvis's drummer D J Fontana. Here's Travis LeDoyt who does young Elvis down to a fried peanut butter and banana sandwich. It could almost have been Elvis himself up on the stage. The King returned to play Tupelo big-time after Heartbreak Hotel hit number one in 1956 and even though he had gone to live at his Liberace-style mansion, Graceland, in Memphis, Tennessee, some three hours drive north. </p> <p>First thing he did when he had his big hit was to buy an open-top Ford and drive home to take his pals out to Johnnie's Drive-In on East Main Street. It's still here. A neon-framed cabin where men with arms the size of your waist sit down to dine in denim dungarees, where the pony-tailed waitress is the stuff of Hollywood dreams and the pie is a la mode, and much more. Closed Sundays; the sign reads \"Gone to church\". As do most folks in Mississippi. </p> <p>There are places of worship at every turn. It would be a miracle if you could squeeze a bible between two of them. Linda, Roy, Jeannine and me went to the Good News Church on West Jackson Street. \"Welcome in the name of Jesus, brother.\" </p> <p>Everybody's welcome down in Tupelo, as at Estes Fish House, as in the House of God. The service was one of the best soul and gospel gigs I've been to. No disrespect. \"If only religion had been as fun as this,\" Jeannine said to me above the funkiest rendition of Amazing Grace you've ever heard, \"we'd be saints by now.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Elvis festival rocks on, with Dr Zarr's Amazing Funk Monster, the Mississippi Mass Choir and live music in wired-up bars. Big-haired barflies out sluttin' for the night. More piss-poor beer than you'd ever want to drink. Guys with long grey hair picking Fenders and Gibsons, although the music shops here sell nothing but Yamaha guitars and electric pianos. Where, I couldn't help thinking were the 12-string, rhinestone-set, semi-acoustic Gretches, the whirring Hammonds of yesterday? </p> <p>Back in your motel, the crickets, bigger than a Cadillac, bigger even than your TV, are singing in your room. Twelve - I counted them all out - hopped lazily from a shirt I'd left draped across my ba-ag. But, then, the whole level Mississippi landscape from the Delta and up to Memphis across the border in Tennessee, is alive with the sound of crickets, frogs and man-made music from every passing truck and car. Yet, there are havens where the music is turned down low and an older, grander culture than popular music prevails. </p> <p> W e stop in Oxford, a delightful university town based around a real arcaded square rather than lined along \"strips\" like good ol' Tupelo. The bookstore here is about as good as they get. The caf\u00e9s are fine, the clothes shops a zoo of snakeskin, rhinestone and sequins sewn up the sides of slits and slashes. </p> <p>We eat takeaway deep-fried pickles. \"We'd deep-fry our grandmothers if it was legal,\" suggests Roy. </p> <p>The architecture drifted by as we headed upstate to the sounds of Matreca Berg, the Dixie Chicks, Faith Hill and Johnny Lang to Holly Springs, a town that hosts dozens of supremely-elegant neoclassical clapboard houses and Phillips Grocery which is said to serve the \"finest hamburger in America\" (or so says USA Today). </p> <p>Well, it was mighty fine, but finer still is the setting that, like so many in Mississippi, looks as if it hasn't changed much since the birth of rock'n'roll. A big shack of a building standing by a yard full of lumbering freight trains. Big Coke machine. Big burgers. Big fries. Big, big heat. Mississippi burning. August isn't the month to go way down in Dixie; in fact the Elvis festival, timed to coincide with the King's untimely collapse on a toilet seat in Graceland, is likely to move to the fall next year. </p> <p>We crossed the state boundary into Tennessee, to Memphis and Sun Studios where rock'n'roll took off and where you can cut your disc, burn your own CD for $75 an hour. Just like Elvis. Despite the heat - by now my brain was deep-fried - I wanted to turn around and do it all over again. The Delta. The legends. The music. Meeting astonishingly generous people with a lust for life. And getting deeper under the deep-fried skin of this enigmatic state. Not forgetting Tupelo: \"Now in this friendly city down in Dixieland/ Y'all come to see us anytime you can/ When you're in the southlands and you want some place to go/ Y'all come down to visit us in good ol' Tupelo.\" </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong></p> <p> Delta Vacations (0870 900 5001) organises seven-night fly-drive holidays to Tennessee and Mississippi, flights London Heathrow to Memphis from \u00a3315, fully-inclusive basic car hire from \u00a3189, per week.

Elvis, said his first producer Sam Philipps of Sun Records, Memphis, \"sang like a black man\". The two cultures were acceptably joined at a wiggling hip and the records sold like hotcakes. Elvis was born in Tupelo ... \"Tupelo ... Tupelo,/ Everybody's welcome down in Tupelo/ Birthplace of Elvis Presley, the King of rock'n'roll/ The Tupelo symphony will thrill your musical soul/ There's blues and country music, bluegrass and gospel too/ And everybody's listening to good ol' fiddle-tee\" [insert barn- dancing fiddle break here]. That was Buddy and Kay Bain, erstwhile stars of TV's Mornin' with Buddy and Kay. With an oddball gang of Americans and Brits, I went to the Elvis Presley Festival in good ol' Tupelo; we sang this yee-hi song with Kay herself in the parking lot of Estes Fish House on a bellyfull of deep-fried this, that and whaddyagot. No question about it, Tupelo, like much of Mississippi is a friendly place. God knows what lurks behind its big, toothy-grinned smile, but the \"southern welcome\" is real enough. This steamy, underpopulated, agricultural state wandering up from the Gulf of Mexico to the Tennessee River along the mighty Mississippi remains, for many outsiders, the stuff of rednecks and lynching, racism and Mississippi Burning, of gun culture and the Ku Klux Klan. The times, though, are a changing. My Mississippi trail was a hot (95-100F), slow shoe-shuffle through the landscape of the blues and country music, bluegrass and gospel too. And, of course, rock'n'roll. That story begins, as much as it begins anywhere, in good ol' Tupelo. This small, sun-scorched city has been home to the annual Elvis Presley Musical Festival for two years now, attracting something like 35,000 people both times, but, as yet, very few tourists from outside the US, or the Confederacy as I far as I could detect from the accents. \"I ain't got no accent,\" says a local ma-an (ie man, but any word worth its weight in catfish here has more than one syllable). The festival is held, outdoors of course, in the parking lot alongside the hardware store where Elvis's mum, Gladys, brought him his first guitar (the future king of rock'n'roll had asked, as you do in Mississippi, for a gun). And just down the road from the school where, accompanied by that first guitar, Elvis won second prize in a talent competition with a tear-jerking rendition of Ol' Shep, a song about a hound dog. It dies. And we know they cried, because you can't turn a crossroads in Tupelo without being introduced to one of Elvis's old school mates, or Scotty Moore, who played lead guitar on That's Alright Mama back in 1954, Elvis's oldest friend Becky Martin, who invites me home to look at old photos, or Presley cousins galore. Cousin Willy sings a rueful rendition of Blue Moon of Kentucky at Estes Fish House. And who's this down at the town's County Jail to greet us, but none other than Sherriff Harold Ray Presley. You get to meet and hear Elvis impersonators at the festival. Here's Ronnie McDowell backed by Scotty Moore, and Elvis's drummer D J Fontana. Here's Travis LeDoyt who does young Elvis down to a fried peanut butter and banana sandwich. It could almost have been Elvis himself up on the stage. The King returned to play Tupelo big-time after Heartbreak Hotel hit number one in 1956 and even though he had gone to live at his Liberace-style mansion, Graceland, in Memphis, Tennessee, some three hours drive north. First thing he did when he had his big hit was to buy an open-top Ford and drive home to take his pals out to Johnnie's Drive-In on East Main Street. It's still here. A neon-framed cabin where men with arms the size of your waist sit down to dine in denim dungarees, where the pony-tailed waitress is the stuff of Hollywood dreams and the pie is a la mode, and much more. Closed Sundays; the sign reads \"Gone to church\". As do most folks in Mississippi. There are places of worship at every turn. It would be a miracle if you could squeeze a bible between two of them. Linda, Roy, Jeannine and me went to the Good News Church on West Jackson Street. \"Welcome in the name of Jesus, brother.\" Everybody's welcome down in Tupelo, as at Estes Fish House, as in the House of God. The service was one of the best soul and gospel gigs I've been to. No disrespect. \"If only religion had been as fun as this,\" Jeannine said to me above the funkiest rendition of Amazing Grace you've ever heard, \"we'd be saints by now.\" Meanwhile, the Elvis festival rocks on, with Dr Zarr's Amazing Funk Monster, the Mississippi Mass Choir and live music in wired-up bars. Big-haired barflies out sluttin' for the night. More piss-poor beer than you'd ever want to drink. Guys with long grey hair picking Fenders and Gibsons, although the music shops here sell nothing but Yamaha guitars and electric pianos. Where, I couldn't help thinking were the 12-string, rhinestone-set, semi-acoustic Gretches, the whirring Hammonds of yesterday? Back in your motel, the crickets, bigger than a Cadillac, bigger even than your TV, are singing in your room. Twelve - I counted them all out - hopped lazily from a shirt I'd left draped across my ba-ag. But, then, the whole level Mississippi landscape from the Delta and up to Memphis across the border in Tennessee, is alive with the sound of crickets, frogs and man-made music from every passing truck and car. Yet, there are havens where the music is turned down low and an older, grander culture than popular music prevails. W e stop in Oxford, a delightful university town based around a real arcaded square rather than lined along \"strips\" like good ol' Tupelo. The bookstore here is about as good as they get. The caf\u00e9s are fine, the clothes shops a zoo of snakeskin, rhinestone and sequins sewn up the sides of slits and slashes. We eat takeaway deep-fried pickles. \"We'd deep-fry our grandmothers if it was legal,\" suggests Roy. The architecture drifted by as we headed upstate to the sounds of Matreca Berg, the Dixie Chicks, Faith Hill and Johnny Lang to Holly Springs, a town that hosts dozens of supremely-elegant neoclassical clapboard houses and Phillips Grocery which is said to serve the \"finest hamburger in America\" (or so says USA Today). Well, it was mighty fine, but finer still is the setting that, like so many in Mississippi, looks as if it hasn't changed much since the birth of rock'n'roll. A big shack of a building standing by a yard full of lumbering freight trains. Big Coke machine. Big burgers. Big fries. Big, big heat. Mississippi burning. August isn't the month to go way down in Dixie; in fact the Elvis festival, timed to coincide with the King's untimely collapse on a toilet seat in Graceland, is likely to move to the fall next year. We crossed the state boundary into Tennessee, to Memphis and Sun Studios where rock'n'roll took off and where you can cut your disc, burn your own CD for $75 an hour. Just like Elvis. Despite the heat - by now my brain was deep-fried - I wanted to turn around and do it all over again. The Delta. The legends. The music. Meeting astonishingly generous people with a lust for life. And getting deeper under the deep-fried skin of this enigmatic state. Not forgetting Tupelo: \"Now in this friendly city down in Dixieland/ Y'all come to see us anytime you can/ When you're in the southlands and you want some place to go/ Y'all come down to visit us in good ol' Tupelo.\" The practicals Delta Vacations (0870 900 5001) organises seven-night fly-drive holidays to Tennessee and Mississippi, flights London Heathrow to Memphis from \u00a3315, fully-inclusive basic car hire from \u00a3189, per week.

The players, administrators as well as cricket lovers are the custodians of the game. It is our responsibility to guard the game against such scandals.\" Kent coach <strong>John Wright</strong> is rumoured to be about to replace Kapil Dev as Indian coach.</p> <p> <strong>Monday September 4<br>AC Muthiah</strong>, president of the BCCI, says that a decision on the future of Kapil Dev will be announced shortly. \"I will announce the decision a week before the conditioning camp [for the provisional squad selected for the ICC Trophy tournament at Nairobi] begins in Chennai on September 14.\" </p> <p> <strong>Tuesday September 5</strong><br> PCB chairman Lt Gen Tauqir Zia confirms that <strong>Salim Malik</strong> has been asked to confirm whether he is to instigate court proceedings in an attempt to overturn the life ban afforded him in the Qayyum report. \"What he was supposed to tell us was whether he plans to challenge the decision or not. In his reply, he has not responded to this. The PCB has written him a fresh letter directing him to be precise and stay on track. He has been asked whether he intends to go to the court of law or not.\" </p> <p><strong>Wednesday September 6</strong><br> The Sindh High Court orders eight Pakistani cricketers - <strong>Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Salim Malik, Saeed Anwar, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Akram Raza, Mushtaq Ahmed</strong> and <strong>Ata-ur-Rehman</strong> - to appear before it on September 25. The summons is in connection with a citizen's petition calling for the players to be banned from the game and prosecuted over match-fixing. </p> <p><strong>Thursday September 7</strong><br>The CBI finally question <strong>Kapil Dev</strong> about allegations made by Manoj Prabhakar that Dev had tried to bribe him to underperform in a Singer Cup match in Sri Lanka 1994. He is one of the last people to be questioned by the CBI, who are to submit an interim report on their investigations shortly. </p> <p>Salim Malik's lawyer <strong>Shahid Hamid</strong> says that his client's life ban was not legally imposed and he is ready to challenge it. \"To the best of my knowledge Malik is not in receipt of any order of Pakistan Cricket Board imposing on him the punishment recommended in Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum's report. PCB served a show-cause notice on Malik asking him why recommendations of Justice Qayyum be not imposed and Malik has given a detailed reply and gave reasons why the punishments be not imposed. Personal hearing is [Malik's] right so that he can clarify his side.\"</p> <p>CBI officials have an informal meeting with <strong>Sachin Tendulkar</strong> in Mumbai, in which he is asked for his opinion on a number of matters, including the atmosphere in the dressing-room, relationships between players, and whether outsiders were found in the dressing-room on a regular basis.</p> <p>Having been questioned by the CBI, <strong>Kapil Dev</strong> says that he is \"very happy and relieved. I will be able to sleep well tonight.\"</p> <p><strong>Friday September 8</strong><br> Sources close to the CBI suggest that their interim report into \"an exhaustive picture of corruption\" is likely to be released on September 29. </p> <p>Reports suggest that this report will implicate two English cricketers, and three Pakistanis, who have apparently been exposed by CBI investigations.</p> <p>BCCI selection committee chairman <strong>Chandu Borde</strong> suggests that the match-fixing investigation should be expedited to restore the image of the game. \"Cricket stands maligned after the match-fixing scandal and spectators have become suspicious about the game. If cricket in the country has to restore its lost glory, match-fixing cases should be solved immediately.\"</p> <p>On rediff.com, <strong>R N Savani</strong>, the joint director of investigations for the CBI, says that the agency is debating asking <strong>Manoj Prabhakar</strong> to undergo a lie-detector test. \"This might become necessary as all those who had been summoned as witnesses at the instance of Prabhakar have refused to testify in his favour. We have now examined Kapil Dev as well and there is no-one else who can tell us more. We have been on the job since May this year and now we want to know if there is any truth in these allegations or someone has sent the CBI on a wild-goose chase. There is no way we can find this out unless we ask Prabhakar to undergo a lie-detector test.\"</p> <p><strong>Saturday September 11</strong><br> The Indian Minister of State for Sports, <strong>Shahnawaz Hussain</strong>, says that it is not just players who are likely to be affected by the CBI's imminent report. \"Many icons of Indian cricket could fall from the pedestal once the CBI wraps up its probe into betting and match-fixing in the game. Besides the superstars of the game, the CBI report is also likely to point an accusing finger at some other bigwigs associated with the game.\"</p> <p><strong>Sunday September 10</strong><br> In The Sunday Telegraph, <strong>Det. Supt Steve Gwilliam</strong>, the head of the Scotland Yard probe into allegations of bribery made by <strong>Chris Lewis</strong>, says that he would be \"very surprised\" if two English players were to be named in the CBI interim report. \"I know absolutely nothing about this at all. I'd be very surprised if this was true bearing in mind that we do talk to the Indians regularly.\"</p> <p>BCCI secretary <strong>Jaywant Lele</strong> reasserts his belief that the integrity of the spine of the Indian team should stop the match-fixing problem breaking the back of Indian cricket. \"Saurav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and Javagal Srinath are free from any allegations and the Indian team is safe in their hands.\" He also reiterates that any player found guilty of match-fixing will be banned for life.</p> <p><strong>Sunil Gavaskar</strong> echoes Lele's sentiments at a function in Mumbai. \"Just as one corrupt policeman will not make the entire department corrupt and one corrupt journalist would not put the entire media into shame, one shady cricketer could not bring darkness into the world of cricket.\"</p> <p><strong>Tuesday September 12</strong><br>Despite speculation that he is to be replaced as Indian coach, <strong>Kapil Dev</strong> is asked to take charge of the Indian team at their preparatory camp in Chennai on September 14. BCCI president <strong>AC Muthiah</strong> says that, \"the BCCI's stand that it will not take any action on players or administrators, unless they were proved guilty, will remain.\"</p> <p> <em>But later on the same day...</em><br><strong>Kapil Dev</strong> resigns as coach of India. In a letter to BCCI president <strong>AC Muthiah</strong>, Kapil said, \"I was waiting to be cleared by the investigating agencies before I gave in my resignation as I did not wish it to look like some kind of admission of guilt. Even though I know the investigation report will be submitted only later this month, unfortunately I cannot wait until that happens as the [preparatory] camp for our boys [ahead of the ICC Knockout Tournament in Kenya next month] begins in two days and I would not like to start a job I will not finish.\"</p> <p><strong> Jaywant Lele</strong>, secretary of the BCCI, expresses his surprise at Kapil's resignation. \"We were not expecting it, especially after we sent him a letter asking him to proceed to Nairobi for the ICC Knockout tournament between October 3 and 15.\" Kapil is to be replaced on a temporary basis by former opening batsman, and his predecessor as coach, <strong>Anshuman Gaekwad</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday September 13</strong><br>In <em>The Times of India</em>, Kapil Dev says that cricket has been \"murdered\" and criticises his treatment by the BCCI. \"The game that gave me everything has now taken its pound of flesh from me. I have taken what came to me, but I would request the Board to be kinder to the next coach and give him his due respect, if they have the welfare of the game at heart. This is not a battle of flexing our muscles. The game which has been murdered has to slowly be brought back to life.\"</p> <p><strong>Friday September 15</strong><br><strong>Manoj Prabhakar</strong> says that he is ready to take a lie-detector test, but that he should not be alone in doing so. \"I am ready to take [the test], but only on the condition that the other people involved in the controversy also take it. Why should I be the only one to take the test? I would like all of them to sit there when I take the test and ask me questions. And then I would like to sit through their questioning and have them answer my questions too. I think that is quite fair. And I don't think anybody should say no if they believe they have been honest all the while.\"</p> <p>New Indian coach <strong>Anshuman Gaekwad</strong> calls on the media to help restore cricket's integrity. \"I have had a word with the boys, and I have told them that along with trying to win, we also have the duty of trying to clean up our tarnished image. They have agreed and are prepared to do it. And to do that, I sincerely believe that I need the help of the media a great deal. The media is responsible to a great deal in causing the situation and now we have to rectify it together. See, look at it my way - cricketers will come and cricketers will go, but if cricket as a game dies, there'll be no return.\"</p> <p><strong>Saturday September 16</strong><br> CBI director <strong>RK Raghavan</strong> says the agency are \"burning midnight oil\" to submit their interim report as quickly as possible. When asked whether the report will name any Indian cricketers, Raghavan says, \"there may be one or two [but] it will be dishonest on my part to say that I have come to that conclusion.\"</p> <p><strong>Monday September 18</strong><br> Press Trust of India reports that the King Commission Chief Prosecutor <strong>Shamila Batohi</strong> is to meet Delhi Police Commissioner <strong>Ajay Raj Sharma</strong> today. Batohi, along with investigation captain <strong>Geoff Edwards</strong>, left Johannesburg on Saturday for a week-long visit in which she hopes to obtain copies of the Cronjegate tapes that originally sparked the match-fixing scandal.</p> <p>Former Indian opener <strong>Pankaj Roy</strong> describes the handling of the match-fixing controversy as a \"total farce.\" \"The Board as well as the Government didn't handle the situation well. Where is even the preliminary report of the investigating agencies?\"</p> <p><strong>Tuesday September 19</strong><br> Initial discussions between <strong> Shamila Batohi</strong>, the King Commission's chief prosecutor, and Delhi Police are deadlocked by legal formalities. Batohi is keen to gain access to the police tapes of an alleged conversation between a bookmaker and Cronje. \"Since it is a criminal case, the court's permission has to be obtained before the tapes are handed over,\" says Crime Branch Deputy Police Commissioner <strong> Pradeep Srivastava</strong>.</p> <p><strong> Wednesday September 20 </strong> <br> Reports from India suggest that <strong> Shamila Batohi </strong> is likely to return home without the Cronjegate tapes. Police chief <strong> Ajay Raj Sharma </strong> says that South African authorities will have to appeal to the Indian judiciary for copies of the tapes which have been sealed by the Delhi Police crime branch detectives as court property.</p> <p><strong> Batohi </strong> asks Delhi Police to authenticate transcripts of the tapes. \"The tapes are in the custody of the court and it could be obtained only after completing certain legal formalities. But as of now, I have asked the Delhi police to authenticate the transcript of the taped conversation.\" Batohi also has a two-hour meeting with CBI director <strong> RK Raghavan </strong> and joint director <strong> RN Savani</strong>, which she describes as \"satisfactory.\"</p> <p><strong> Thursday September 21 </strong> <br> The CBI completes its report into the match-fixing scandal. Sources suggest it may be released in the first week of October.</p> <p>South African authorities promise to release details of Cronje's bank accounts and telephone calls to Delhi Police in return for transcripts of the tapes. \"Cronje's bank details will be of immense help to us as entries will show what money was deposited in the account, which we will use as collaborative evidence when the case goes to trial. The details will also show the origin of the dirty money,\" says a Delhi Police official.</p> <p><strong> Saturday September 23 </strong> <br> <strong> Shamila Batohi </strong> returns to South Africa with transcripts of the Cronje tapes. \"We have authenticated copies of the transcripts of the taped conversations. I am satisfied they are what we're looking for. We need to decide whether they are sufficient for our purposes and whether we need to make an application for the original tapes.\"</p> <p><strong> Sunday September 24 </strong> <br> <strong> Nidesh Gupta</strong>, Manoj Prabhakar's lawyer, confirms that his client is to undertake a lie-detector test. \"We have replied to the CBI's request for a lie-detector test and also put forward some suggestions before <strong> Prabhakar </strong> agrees to undertake such a test.\" He also confirms the conditions under which he will undertake the test. \"I have no problem in undergoing a lie-detector test, but it would only be fair if others involved in the CBI cricket inquiry are also called for the same test.\"</p> <p><strong>Monday September 25</strong><br> <strong>Justice Sabihuddin Ahmed</strong> of the Sindh High Court dismisses a petition from lawyer <strong>Qadir Khan Mandokhail</strong>, which had called for those implicated in the Qayyum Report to be jailed. The court ruled that Qadir was \"seeking personal publicity.\"</p> <p><strong>Tuesday September 26</strong><br> <strong>Wasim Akram</strong> says that he is considering an appeal against the fine imposed upon him by the Qayyum report. \"I received a show-cause notice from Pakistan Cricket Board, and will consult my lawyer before appealing against the fine.\"</p> <p> <strong>Thursday September 28</strong><br> The PCB sets a deadline of Saturday for players to appeal against fines meted out in the Qayyum Report. The deadline has been imposed to clear the matter up before the team depart for the ICC Knockout Trophy in Kenya. The squad includes four of the six implicated players: <strong>Wasim Akram</strong>, <strong> Waqar Younis</strong>, <strong> Inzamam-ul-Haq </strong> and <strong> Saeed Anwar</strong>. A spokesman said, \"If the players don't appeal against the penalties, fines would be deducted from their salaries before the team leaves for Kenya.\"</p> <p> The CBI rejects <strong>Manoj Prabhakar\u00d5s</strong> assertion that all players questioned in connection with match-fixing should be asked to undertake a lie-detector test along with him.</p> <p>Sources close to the CBI confirm that the interim match-fixing report will be submitted to Sports Minister <strong>SS Dhindsa</strong> in the first week of October. The report was originally to be handed in at the end of September.</p> <p><strong>Saturday September 30</strong></p> <p><strong>Wasim Akram</strong> lodges an official appeal with the PCB against the fine imposed upon him as a result of the Qayyum Report. \"I hope the fine against Wasim will be withdrawn because he was exonerated by Justice Qayyum,\" Akram's lawyer <strong>Khwaja Tariq Rahim</strong> tells a news agency in Karachi.</p>",

It's all unauthorised, unethical and not acceptable.\" Sir Richard Hadlee urges players and officials to protect cricket from further problems. \"We can never accept bribery and match fixing. The players, administrators as well as cricket lovers are the custodians of the game. It is our responsibility to guard the game against such scandals.\" Kent coach John Wright is rumoured to be about to replace Kapil Dev as Indian coach. Monday September 4 AC Muthiah, president of the BCCI, says that a decision on the future of Kapil Dev will be announced shortly. \"I will announce the decision a week before the conditioning camp [for the provisional squad selected for the ICC Trophy tournament at Nairobi] begins in Chennai on September 14.\" Tuesday September 5 PCB chairman Lt Gen Tauqir Zia confirms that Salim Malik has been asked to confirm whether he is to instigate court proceedings in an attempt to overturn the life ban afforded him in the Qayyum report. \"What he was supposed to tell us was whether he plans to challenge the decision or not. In his reply, he has not responded to this. The PCB has written him a fresh letter directing him to be precise and stay on track. He has been asked whether he intends to go to the court of law or not.\" Wednesday September 6 The Sindh High Court orders eight Pakistani cricketers - Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Salim Malik, Saeed Anwar, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Akram Raza, Mushtaq Ahmed and Ata-ur-Rehman - to appear before it on September 25. The summons is in connection with a citizen's petition calling for the players to be banned from the game and prosecuted over match-fixing. Thursday September 7 The CBI finally question Kapil Dev about allegations made by Manoj Prabhakar that Dev had tried to bribe him to underperform in a Singer Cup match in Sri Lanka 1994. He is one of the last people to be questioned by the CBI, who are to submit an interim report on their investigations shortly. Salim Malik's lawyer Shahid Hamid says that his client's life ban was not legally imposed and he is ready to challenge it. \"To the best of my knowledge Malik is not in receipt of any order of Pakistan Cricket Board imposing on him the punishment recommended in Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum's report. PCB served a show-cause notice on Malik asking him why recommendations of Justice Qayyum be not imposed and Malik has given a detailed reply and gave reasons why the punishments be not imposed. Personal hearing is [Malik's] right so that he can clarify his side.\" CBI officials have an informal meeting with Sachin Tendulkar in Mumbai, in which he is asked for his opinion on a number of matters, including the atmosphere in the dressing-room, relationships between players, and whether outsiders were found in the dressing-room on a regular basis. Having been questioned by the CBI, Kapil Dev says that he is \"very happy and relieved. I will be able to sleep well tonight.\" Friday September 8 Sources close to the CBI suggest that their interim report into \"an exhaustive picture of corruption\" is likely to be released on September 29. Reports suggest that this report will implicate two English cricketers, and three Pakistanis, who have apparently been exposed by CBI investigations. BCCI selection committee chairman Chandu Borde suggests that the match-fixing investigation should be expedited to restore the image of the game. \"Cricket stands maligned after the match-fixing scandal and spectators have become suspicious about the game. If cricket in the country has to restore its lost glory, match-fixing cases should be solved immediately.\" On rediff.com, R N Savani, the joint director of investigations for the CBI, says that the agency is debating asking Manoj Prabhakar to undergo a lie-detector test. \"This might become necessary as all those who had been summoned as witnesses at the instance of Prabhakar have refused to testify in his favour. We have now examined Kapil Dev as well and there is no-one else who can tell us more. We have been on the job since May this year and now we want to know if there is any truth in these allegations or someone has sent the CBI on a wild-goose chase. There is no way we can find this out unless we ask Prabhakar to undergo a lie-detector test.\" Saturday September 11 The Indian Minister of State for Sports, Shahnawaz Hussain, says that it is not just players who are likely to be affected by the CBI's imminent report. \"Many icons of Indian cricket could fall from the pedestal once the CBI wraps up its probe into betting and match-fixing in the game. Besides the superstars of the game, the CBI report is also likely to point an accusing finger at some other bigwigs associated with the game.\" Sunday September 10 In The Sunday Telegraph, Det. Supt Steve Gwilliam, the head of the Scotland Yard probe into allegations of bribery made by Chris Lewis, says that he would be \"very surprised\" if two English players were to be named in the CBI interim report. \"I know absolutely nothing about this at all. I'd be very surprised if this was true bearing in mind that we do talk to the Indians regularly.\" BCCI secretary Jaywant Lele reasserts his belief that the integrity of the spine of the Indian team should stop the match-fixing problem breaking the back of Indian cricket. \"Saurav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and Javagal Srinath are free from any allegations and the Indian team is safe in their hands.\" He also reiterates that any player found guilty of match-fixing will be banned for life. Sunil Gavaskar echoes Lele's sentiments at a function in Mumbai. \"Just as one corrupt policeman will not make the entire department corrupt and one corrupt journalist would not put the entire media into shame, one shady cricketer could not bring darkness into the world of cricket.\" Tuesday September 12 Despite speculation that he is to be replaced as Indian coach, Kapil Dev is asked to take charge of the Indian team at their preparatory camp in Chennai on September 14. BCCI president AC Muthiah says that, \"the BCCI's stand that it will not take any action on players or administrators, unless they were proved guilty, will remain.\" But later on the same day... Kapil Dev resigns as coach of India. In a letter to BCCI president AC Muthiah, Kapil said, \"I was waiting to be cleared by the investigating agencies before I gave in my resignation as I did not wish it to look like some kind of admission of guilt. Even though I know the investigation report will be submitted only later this month, unfortunately I cannot wait until that happens as the [preparatory] camp for our boys [ahead of the ICC Knockout Tournament in Kenya next month] begins in two days and I would not like to start a job I will not finish.\" Jaywant Lele, secretary of the BCCI, expresses his surprise at Kapil's resignation. \"We were not expecting it, especially after we sent him a letter asking him to proceed to Nairobi for the ICC Knockout tournament between October 3 and 15.\" Kapil is to be replaced on a temporary basis by former opening batsman, and his predecessor as coach, Anshuman Gaekwad. Wednesday September 13 In The Times of India, Kapil Dev says that cricket has been \"murdered\" and criticises his treatment by the BCCI. \"The game that gave me everything has now taken its pound of flesh from me. I have taken what came to me, but I would request the Board to be kinder to the next coach and give him his due respect, if they have the welfare of the game at heart. This is not a battle of flexing our muscles. The game which has been murdered has to slowly be brought back to life.\" Friday September 15 Manoj Prabhakar says that he is ready to take a lie-detector test, but that he should not be alone in doing so. \"I am ready to take [the test], but only on the condition that the other people involved in the controversy also take it. Why should I be the only one to take the test? I would like all of them to sit there when I take the test and ask me questions. And then I would like to sit through their questioning and have them answer my questions too. I think that is quite fair. And I don't think anybody should say no if they believe they have been honest all the while.\" New Indian coach Anshuman Gaekwad calls on the media to help restore cricket's integrity. \"I have had a word with the boys, and I have told them that along with trying to win, we also have the duty of trying to clean up our tarnished image. They have agreed and are prepared to do it. And to do that, I sincerely believe that I need the help of the media a great deal. The media is responsible to a great deal in causing the situation and now we have to rectify it together. See, look at it my way - cricketers will come and cricketers will go, but if cricket as a game dies, there'll be no return.\" Saturday September 16 CBI director RK Raghavan says the agency are \"burning midnight oil\" to submit their interim report as quickly as possible. When asked whether the report will name any Indian cricketers, Raghavan says, \"there may be one or two [but] it will be dishonest on my part to say that I have come to that conclusion.\" Monday September 18 Press Trust of India reports that the King Commission Chief Prosecutor Shamila Batohi is to meet Delhi Police Commissioner Ajay Raj Sharma today. Batohi, along with investigation captain Geoff Edwards, left Johannesburg on Saturday for a week-long visit in which she hopes to obtain copies of the Cronjegate tapes that originally sparked the match-fixing scandal. Former Indian opener Pankaj Roy describes the handling of the match-fixing controversy as a \"total farce.\" \"The Board as well as the Government didn't handle the situation well. Where is even the preliminary report of the investigating agencies?\" Tuesday September 19 Initial discussions between Shamila Batohi, the King Commission's chief prosecutor, and Delhi Police are deadlocked by legal formalities. Batohi is keen to gain access to the police tapes of an alleged conversation between a bookmaker and Cronje. \"Since it is a criminal case, the court's permission has to be obtained before the tapes are handed over,\" says Crime Branch Deputy Police Commissioner Pradeep Srivastava. Wednesday September 20 Reports from India suggest that Shamila Batohi is likely to return home without the Cronjegate tapes. Police chief Ajay Raj Sharma says that South African authorities will have to appeal to the Indian judiciary for copies of the tapes which have been sealed by the Delhi Police crime branch detectives as court property. Batohi asks Delhi Police to authenticate transcripts of the tapes. \"The tapes are in the custody of the court and it could be obtained only after completing certain legal formalities. But as of now, I have asked the Delhi police to authenticate the transcript of the taped conversation.\" Batohi also has a two-hour meeting with CBI director RK Raghavan and joint director RN Savani, which she describes as \"satisfactory.\" Thursday September 21 The CBI completes its report into the match-fixing scandal. Sources suggest it may be released in the first week of October. South African authorities promise to release details of Cronje's bank accounts and telephone calls to Delhi Police in return for transcripts of the tapes. \"Cronje's bank details will be of immense help to us as entries will show what money was deposited in the account, which we will use as collaborative evidence when the case goes to trial. The details will also show the origin of the dirty money,\" says a Delhi Police official. Saturday September 23 Shamila Batohi returns to South Africa with transcripts of the Cronje tapes. \"We have authenticated copies of the transcripts of the taped conversations. I am satisfied they are what we're looking for. We need to decide whether they are sufficient for our purposes and whether we need to make an application for the original tapes.\" Sunday September 24 Nidesh Gupta, Manoj Prabhakar's lawyer, confirms that his client is to undertake a lie-detector test. \"We have replied to the CBI's request for a lie-detector test and also put forward some suggestions before Prabhakar agrees to undertake such a test.\" He also confirms the conditions under which he will undertake the test. \"I have no problem in undergoing a lie-detector test, but it would only be fair if others involved in the CBI cricket inquiry are also called for the same test.\" Monday September 25 Justice Sabihuddin Ahmed of the Sindh High Court dismisses a petition from lawyer Qadir Khan Mandokhail, which had called for those implicated in the Qayyum Report to be jailed. The court ruled that Qadir was \"seeking personal publicity.\" Tuesday September 26 Wasim Akram says that he is considering an appeal against the fine imposed upon him by the Qayyum report. \"I received a show-cause notice from Pakistan Cricket Board, and will consult my lawyer before appealing against the fine.\" Thursday September 28 The PCB sets a deadline of Saturday for players to appeal against fines meted out in the Qayyum Report. The deadline has been imposed to clear the matter up before the team depart for the ICC Knockout Trophy in Kenya. The squad includes four of the six implicated players: Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Inzamam-ul-Haq and Saeed Anwar. A spokesman said, \"If the players don't appeal against the penalties, fines would be deducted from their salaries before the team leaves for Kenya.\" The CBI rejects Manoj Prabhakar\u00d5s assertion that all players questioned in connection with match-fixing should be asked to undertake a lie-detector test along with him. Sources close to the CBI confirm that the interim match-fixing report will be submitted to Sports Minister SS Dhindsa in the first week of October. The report was originally to be handed in at the end of September. Saturday September 30 Wasim Akram lodges an official appeal with the PCB against the fine imposed upon him as a result of the Qayyum Report. \"I hope the fine against Wasim will be withdrawn because he was exonerated by Justice Qayyum,\" Akram's lawyer Khwaja Tariq Rahim tells a news agency in Karachi.",

In his retirement, the critic would sometimes wonder if he had dreamed it all.</p> <p>But currently running at the Theatre Royal, Windsor - and about to begin a short UK tour before reaching London - is a production which makes the German horse Hamlet look about as surreal as the plays of Terence Rattigan. For three hours each night, Lord Jeffrey Archer sits in a mock-up of court one of the Old Bailey, playing a prominent man defending himself in a court case which centres on whether or not he lied about a sexual relationship, the existence of distinguishing disfigurements on his torso and the possibility that he might have perjured himself to win a case.</p> <p>When Archer was forced to step down as the Tories' London mayoral candidate, cautious newspaper profile writers warned that his life always tended to contain another twist. This duly arrived with the news that he planned to make his professional acting debut, aged 61, in his third play, a courtroom drama called The Accused.

      "bodyText": "A veteran theatre critic told me that he had once seen a German production of Hamlet in which the prince was played by a horse. The equine thespian was led around the set by a handler while the words, delivered by a human, were projected on the PA system. Ophelia and Gertrude both mounted the lead actor during the scenes of sexual intensity. And, in a more surprising directorial touch, during the \"To be or not to be\" soliloquy, the gelding revenger urinated into a golden chalice held beneath him, leading to fears that a translator's shaky English had encouraged the belief that the speech was about the wisdom of peeing or ceasing to pee. In his retirement, the critic would sometimes wonder if he had dreamed it all. But currently running at the Theatre Royal, Windsor - and about to begin a short UK tour before reaching London - is a production which makes the German horse Hamlet look about as surreal as the plays of Terence Rattigan. For three hours each night, Lord Jeffrey Archer sits in a mock-up of court one of the Old Bailey, playing a prominent man defending himself in a court case which centres on whether or not he lied about a sexual relationship, the existence of distinguishing disfigurements on his torso and the possibility that he might have perjured himself to win a case.

The floor is wood the colour of corn, as are the tables and chairs, which softens the cool of the white. The menu is interesting without being in-your-face. No first course is more than \u00a35.50, no main course more than \u00a313.50, and the puddings are \u00a35 or less. And yet the bill for Bill and I came to \u00a382.60. It just seems impossible these days for two to eat out reasonably well (and our lunch at Chives was rather better than reasonably well) in London for less than \u00a380. </p> <p>That will probably get me a whole raft of letters from readers, chefs and their PRs telling me about some gem of gems where you can get three courses of the finest food on God's own acre for less than a tenner and with a magnum of bottled sunshine thrown in for good measure. But, in my experience, such places are so few and far between that you are more likely to win the lottery. </p> <p>That is not to say that you cannot eat pleasurably and decently for less than \u00a340 a head. You can, and I have reviewed a few places along those lines. But when it comes to your common-or-garden smart, metropolitan eating house with style and social ambition, then 80 quid for two seems the norm - and that means 90-odd quid, if you add in a fairly standard 12.5% service charge (tip, gratuity, call it what you will). </p> <p>Of course, drinks account for a certain amount of the total. We drank a bottle of juicy Tuscan Morellino di Scansano that weighed in at \u00a322 - probably a mark-up of around 200%, which isn't extravagant by restaurant standards - and this was very well worthwhile drinking from a list largely devoted to Italian wines. To that we must add a brace of Campari sodas, \u00a310 the pair, which is excessive but not abnormal; one double espresso and a single, \u00a33.60 all-in. So, the total for non-food items was \u00a335.60, a shade under half the total. That left \u00a347 on food, or \u00a323.50 for three courses each, which doesn't seem so bad - and, in fact, wasn't bad, considering the quality of the grub. </p> <p>You can tell a lot about a chef from the way in which he or she treats small details. A little cup of cauliflower soup came our way before the main show kicked off. It was smooth and velvety from passing through sieves, and indubitably cauliflowery, with the vegetable flavours seamed into top-quality chicken stock. It was the stock that made this little dish something of a show-stopper. </p> <p>Bill went the way of a brochette of crispy salmon with vinaigrette of capers and chives (I give you menu-speak raw and unadorned). The salmon was average-quality farmed stuff, but the treatment gave that unremarkable protein a real touch of class. The top was, indeed, crisp, bringing out a certain meatiness, and the vinaigrette was luscious, fresh, tingling the tongue, without killing the flavour of the fish. </p> <p>The ravioli of duck confit with a velout\u00e9 of lentils on which I lavished a good deal of time was quite the opposite. Whereas Bill's dish sprang around the mouth with zip and energy, mine was subtle, comforting, elegantly muscular, gradually filling out as I chewed and swallowed. There was only one raviolo, but its casing was made of delicate, lightweight pasta, as it needs to be. The filling was delicately fibrous, the sweet meat devoid of all fattiness. On top was a little frizz of what I take to have been shredded skin roasted to a crunch. The earthy nature of the lentils had been given an additional authority by a superb duck stock cut with a shade of vinegar. </p> <p>This sophisticated handling of the underlying materials helped make my next course of roast cod with shellfish ragout and bouillabaisse sauce a class act, too. The sauce tasted resolutely and resoundingly of shellfish, that wonderful toasted sweetness that comes from roasting lobster, langoustines and prawn shells before you start making the stock. The cod had also been given the crispy treatment, which, I suspect, involves a judicious bit of salting beforehand to draw out some of the liquid. The flesh underneath broke away in easy, glistening sections. It was a bit of a star turn. </p> <p>The salad that I had asked to go with it was one of the few disappointments: the leaves were a run-of-the-mill jumble of torn-up bits that you can find in most supermarkets, with a dressing from which someone appeared to have omitted the oil. It was inedible. </p> <p>Some cost-cutting on the raw ingredients also cast a shadow over Bill's rump of lamb with crushed potatoes and jus Ni\u00e7oise. It was a dish that would have worked if the lamb had had any kind of distinctive flavour, but this particular beast had a fugitive, slightly watery quality, which provided no focus for the dish. The other parts were fine, although I do long for a chef who can think of something other than some variation on the Ni\u00e7oise/ Proven\u00e7al/olive-crusted/garlic-and-something approach to lamb. This wasn't bad, just disappointing in view of the surrounding quality. </p> <p>We returned to the sunny uplands with our puddings - a pear-and-almond tart with exemplary pastry and a sublime pear sorbet, and some wonderful light, crisp peach beignets with a showcase vanilla ice cream. </p> <p>So, I paid up \u00a382.60 (or \u00a392.84 including service charge, tip or gratuity). I pondered on the price. It had been worth it - I felt very well fed, and not fed up. Still, \u00a382.60 is no small potatoes. How do you get away for less these days?</p>",

      "body": "<p>John Vickers is the new consumers' champion. The new director general of fair trading is prepared to take on anything from dodgy secondhand car dealers to multinational corporations. It is this Harry Potter lookalike who will ensure the consumer is not being ripped off. After two years at the Bank of England helping to set the nation's interest rates, Mr Vickers explains that his new job to bust cartels and prevent monopolies is not just an unattainable utopia dreamt up by academics - like himself. </p> <p>\"An important ingredient in getting a good deal is being in a situation where there's rivalry between those who want to sell to you. So I think competition isn't some sort of lofty end in itself,\" he says. </p> <p><strong> Strictly business</strong><br> </p> <p> Oxford-educated and a former professor of economics at All Souls College, Vickers sees \"practical, pragmatic, prudent\" reasons for ensuring that companies are forced to behave competitively. And he will have more powers than any of his predecessors to ensure they do. His manner is strictly business: he is quick to deny a funny anecdote regarding a college ritual involving a duck. </p> <p>Vickers will be the first \"DGFT\", as staff refer to the director general, to levy potentially hefty fines against offending companies. As much as 10% of a company's turnover for three years, the first could be handed out within weeks of him taking office when cases initiated by his controversial predecessor, John Bridgeman, reach their conclusion. </p> <p>Under the new competition act which came into force in March, Vickers also has the power to prevent companies abusing their market power. To encourage cartel-busting, he will be able to grant amnesties to companies which snitch on their cohorts. But other increases to his powers look threatened by the apparent decision to leave a new consumer rights bill out of the Queen's speech at the start of the next parliament. </p> <p>The government has also put procedures in place to keep his powers in check. The Department of Trade and Industry is taking views on setting up a board to run the OFT. </p> <p>Vickers, a surprise choice for the \u00a3170,000 a year role, insists he is \"supportive\" of a plan which would also require the OFT to publish the minutes of case discussions at the board meetings. \"It will bring a variety of perspectives to the OFT and its decision makers,\" says Vickers, who has experience of the controversy over the publication of minutes from his tenure on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. </p> <p>The son of an Eastbourne handbag retailer is steadfast in his refusal to discuss monetary policy. For the record, the studious 42-year-old was one of the hawks who argued unsuccessfully for a rise in interest rates in August to keep inflation in check. </p> <p>Vickers maintained a low profile in his time as the Bank's chief economist, allowing Mervyn King, who did the job before his promotion to deputy governor, to take the leading role. Even when King gave him the opportunity for a swansong at his final media briefing, Vickers declined and let King do the talking. </p> <p>In his new role it will be tougher for him to lurk in the shadows. He is taking on a position which took six months to fill. As Bridgeman found to his cost, the job regularly pitches the OFT against government. It is widely believed that Vickers is filling a job which the incumbent was forced to relinquish after disagreeing with the government's \"rip off Britain\" campaign. </p> <p>Not willing to react to the rumours, Vickers deftly sidesteps the issue and credits Bridgeman with transforming the OFT. He compares it to the MPC, which he also joined just as it started to increase its transparency. </p> <p><strong> Real independence</strong><br> </p> <p> \"The key to what's happening with monetary policy is that there's a clearly independent monetary policy committee which is seen to be independent. The credibility of the arrangement depends in a large part on that independence,\" says Vickers. </p> <p>The same is true of his new role. \"I am, and the OFT is, independent,\" he says. This stand, he points out, must be seen to be real to make the office work effectively. He is reluctant to discuss specifics of the caseload which he inherits on Monday morning. His first day coincides with the start of a potentially high profile OFT attempt to smash the price fixing agreements of over-the-counter medicines such as Lemsip and Nurofen. </p> <p>These items, found in millions of medicine cabinets around the country, are the only ones left in the UK where manufacturers and suppliers can legally set minimum resale prices to the public. The arrangement, granted 30 years ago, is less well known than that for books which was abandoned so publicly three years ago. </p> <p>The case, to be heard in the restrictive practices court, follows a five year investigation by the competition authority. As it begins, news of the OFT's decisions on supermarket pricing and the \"beer orders\" - including moves to put full measures in pubs - is eagerly awaited. The OFT is already working on the \"professions\", such as accountancy and the law, and on motorway services after complaints from consumers about prices and quality. </p> <p>Vickers thinks such investigations should take place in a European and international context. EU rules are already influencing the OFT, particularly over the scrutiny of \"unfair terms\" in contracts with consumers. Europe's human rights rules also keep the OFT in check while the globalisation of business means that healthy relationships need to be maintained with transatlantic regulators. </p> <p>He expects to start to feel impact of e-commerce and the internet, with their potential for keeping prices low. \"The internet will increase competition. The upside is large. It increases competition and the richness of information for the customer,\" says Vickers, pointing out that the \"downside\" is the potential for fraud in cyberspace. </p> <p>This is where his language belies his economist background, as he emphasises that it is a \"long-term trend\" and talks about the \"longer run\". He is still very much the academic, a career from which he has only been parted for two years and where he became associated with detailed economic analysis of competition policy and regulatory reform. </p> <p>He was chosen by New Labour to help devise recent competition policy but despite this link to the government, his CV lacks any mention of political activity. He says his interest in regulation and competition began during the privatisation of the utilities by the Thatcher government when he was researching business and public policy. </p> <p>He is the first of acknowledge that the work of the OFT can be very theoretical and dry but insists it should be as \"down to earth\" as possible. \"I say this because I really do think the benefits of competition are practical,\" he says. </p> <p>To turn theory into populist measures, Vickers will have to get used to the public eye and to becoming more widely recognised. Just so long as it does not stop him paddling anonymously with his three young children in the pool near his Cotswold home.</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Vickers is the new consumers' champion. The new director general of fair trading is prepared to take on anything from dodgy secondhand car dealers to multinational corporations. It is this Harry Potter lookalike who will ensure the consumer is not being ripped off. After two years at the Bank of England helping to set the nation's interest rates, Mr Vickers explains that his new job to bust cartels and prevent monopolies is not just an unattainable utopia dreamt up by academics - like himself. \"An important ingredient in getting a good deal is being in a situation where there's rivalry between those who want to sell to you. So I think competition isn't some sort of lofty end in itself,\" he says. Strictly business Oxford-educated and a former professor of economics at All Souls College, Vickers sees \"practical, pragmatic, prudent\" reasons for ensuring that companies are forced to behave competitively. And he will have more powers than any of his predecessors to ensure they do. His manner is strictly business: he is quick to deny a funny anecdote regarding a college ritual involving a duck. Vickers will be the first \"DGFT\", as staff refer to the director general, to levy potentially hefty fines against offending companies. As much as 10% of a company's turnover for three years, the first could be handed out within weeks of him taking office when cases initiated by his controversial predecessor, John Bridgeman, reach their conclusion. Under the new competition act which came into force in March, Vickers also has the power to prevent companies abusing their market power. To encourage cartel-busting, he will be able to grant amnesties to companies which snitch on their cohorts. But other increases to his powers look threatened by the apparent decision to leave a new consumer rights bill out of the Queen's speech at the start of the next parliament. The government has also put procedures in place to keep his powers in check. The Department of Trade and Industry is taking views on setting up a board to run the OFT. Vickers, a surprise choice for the \u00a3170,000 a year role, insists he is \"supportive\" of a plan which would also require the OFT to publish the minutes of case discussions at the board meetings. \"It will bring a variety of perspectives to the OFT and its decision makers,\" says Vickers, who has experience of the controversy over the publication of minutes from his tenure on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. The son of an Eastbourne handbag retailer is steadfast in his refusal to discuss monetary policy. For the record, the studious 42-year-old was one of the hawks who argued unsuccessfully for a rise in interest rates in August to keep inflation in check. Vickers maintained a low profile in his time as the Bank's chief economist, allowing Mervyn King, who did the job before his promotion to deputy governor, to take the leading role. Even when King gave him the opportunity for a swansong at his final media briefing, Vickers declined and let King do the talking. In his new role it will be tougher for him to lurk in the shadows. He is taking on a position which took six months to fill. As Bridgeman found to his cost, the job regularly pitches the OFT against government. It is widely believed that Vickers is filling a job which the incumbent was forced to relinquish after disagreeing with the government's \"rip off Britain\" campaign. Not willing to react to the rumours, Vickers deftly sidesteps the issue and credits Bridgeman with transforming the OFT. He compares it to the MPC, which he also joined just as it started to increase its transparency. Real independence \"The key to what's happening with monetary policy is that there's a clearly independent monetary policy committee which is seen to be independent. The credibility of the arrangement depends in a large part on that independence,\" says Vickers. The same is true of his new role. \"I am, and the OFT is, independent,\" he says. This stand, he points out, must be seen to be real to make the office work effectively. He is reluctant to discuss specifics of the caseload which he inherits on Monday morning. His first day coincides with the start of a potentially high profile OFT attempt to smash the price fixing agreements of over-the-counter medicines such as Lemsip and Nurofen. These items, found in millions of medicine cabinets around the country, are the only ones left in the UK where manufacturers and suppliers can legally set minimum resale prices to the public. The arrangement, granted 30 years ago, is less well known than that for books which was abandoned so publicly three years ago. The case, to be heard in the restrictive practices court, follows a five year investigation by the competition authority. As it begins, news of the OFT's decisions on supermarket pricing and the \"beer orders\" - including moves to put full measures in pubs - is eagerly awaited. The OFT is already working on the \"professions\", such as accountancy and the law, and on motorway services after complaints from consumers about prices and quality. Vickers thinks such investigations should take place in a European and international context. EU rules are already influencing the OFT, particularly over the scrutiny of \"unfair terms\" in contracts with consumers. Europe's human rights rules also keep the OFT in check while the globalisation of business means that healthy relationships need to be maintained with transatlantic regulators. He expects to start to feel impact of e-commerce and the internet, with their potential for keeping prices low. \"The internet will increase competition. The upside is large. It increases competition and the richness of information for the customer,\" says Vickers, pointing out that the \"downside\" is the potential for fraud in cyberspace. This is where his language belies his economist background, as he emphasises that it is a \"long-term trend\" and talks about the \"longer run\". He is still very much the academic, a career from which he has only been parted for two years and where he became associated with detailed economic analysis of competition policy and regulatory reform. He was chosen by New Labour to help devise recent competition policy but despite this link to the government, his CV lacks any mention of political activity. He says his interest in regulation and competition began during the privatisation of the utilities by the Thatcher government when he was researching business and public policy. He is the first of acknowledge that the work of the OFT can be very theoretical and dry but insists it should be as \"down to earth\" as possible. \"I say this because I really do think the benefits of competition are practical,\" he says. To turn theory into populist measures, Vickers will have to get used to the public eye and to becoming more widely recognised. Just so long as it does not stop him paddling anonymously with his three young children in the pool near his Cotswold home.",

      "body": "<p><strong> The Blind Assassin</strong> </p> <p> Margaret Atwood </p> <p>521pp, Bloomsbury</p> <p> \u00a316.99 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502453121,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> <br></p> <p> In her tenth novel, Margaret Atwood again demonstrates that she has mastered the art of creating dense, complex fictions from carefully layered narratives, making use of an array of literary devices - flashbacks, multiple time schemes, ambiguous, indeterminate plots - and that she can hook her readers by virtue of her exceptional story-telling skills. The Blind Assassin is not a book that can easily be put to one side, in spite of its length and the fact that its twists and turns occasionally try the patience; yet it falls short of making the emotional impact that its suggestive and slippery plot at times promises. </p> <p>Initially, the omens are good, with the introduction of a familiar Atwood protagonist. Iris Chase Griffen, like the heroines of Surfacing and Cat's Eye , has embarked on a return journey to her past from the isolated outpost of the present. Unlike them, her voyage is not literal, but literary; she is determined to write down the story of her life before her failing heart finally gets the better of her, hoping that this process of setting the story straight might lead to reconciliation with her estranged granddaughter Sabrina. Her tentative, halting account, pregnant with false starts and blind alleys, is interspersed with chapters from her sister Laura's novel The Blind Assassin, published posthumously in the 1940s after Laura committed suicide by driving off a bridge. </p> <p>The book did more than make Laura famous; it made her a martyr. As Iris, now in her 80s, hobbles fretfully around the small town in which the sisters grew up, she still comes across weeping young women laying flowers on Laura's grave and finds their impassioned graffiti on washroom walls. Worse, she must deal with the attentions of the academic \"corpse flies\", which she does with much asperity: \"Dear Ms X, I acknowledge your letter concerning your proposed thesis, though I can't say its title makes a great deal of sense to me - I cannot give you any help. Also you do not deserve any. 'Deconstruction' implies the wrecking ball, and 'problematize' is not a verb.\" </p> <p> The Blind Assassin's celebrity does not wholly rest on the premature death of its author, nor on the whiff of scandal that attaches to the family (the Chase daughters were the surviving remnants of a wealthy, industrial line, and Iris, at the time of its publication, was married to a prominent businessman and would-be politician). From the fragments we are given, we begin to understand that it is also a compelling love story, in which the participants in a clandestine affair scurry from park bench to squalid borrowed room, forever fleeing unnamed pursuers. She, we infer, is a prisoner of some kind of domestic regime, while he is under threat of imminent arrest following a botched strike action. During their meetings, they comfort one another with escape into the imagined world of the planet Zycron, where the city of Sakiel-Norn teeters on the brink of disaster. In one strand of their shared story, a blind assassin - one of the city's children, made sightless through enforced labour sewing carpets - rescues a sacrificial virgin who has had her tongue cut out. </p> <p>We can see, as Iris wryly points out, what fun the women's studies brigade would have had with that subplot, and indeed, the symbolism of the lovers' inspired science fiction resonates with their own position and with the events Iris retells as she traces the sisters' lives from childhood to catastrophic adulthood. Yet at times there are simply too many threads for Atwood to weave into the carpet, as she muses on themes of authorship and confession, the simultaneous empowerment and impotence of secret storytelling, and the hopeless position of women whose fates, through blood, money or love, are tied to men. </p> <p>Where Atwood succeeds, and succeeds magnificently, is in the evocation of childhood, the territory that she mined so productively and memorably in Cat's Eye . Here it is invested with all the drama and intensity of a gothic horror story, as we spy on Iris and Laura in Avilion, their monstrous Victorian castle of a home. There, saintly mother slips away in childbirth, war-wrecked father shuts himself up in the turrets with the whisky bottle, and a succession of ill-fated tutors attempt in vain to drum Tennyson and calculus into their unruly charges. </p> <p>Atwood is terrific on the circumstances that cause the sisters to wander down different but equally doomed paths; pragmatic Iris offering herself up to a forced marriage in mute, furious self- sacrifice, wayward Laura engaged in \"loony metaphysics\", driving bargains with God to stave off further loss and destruction. Their creator, knowing well the love, hatred and indifference of family bonds, draws a relationship that goes deeper than sibling rivalry and into the far more treacherous waters of mutual dependence. </p> <p>But as the present-day Iris (stumbling around her ramshackle cottage and fending off the attentions of do-gooders) continues with her tale, it mutates into all-out melodrama, complete with a pair of grotesque villains - emissaries from the world outside Avilion - who infiltrate the family and appropriate the sisters with all the ease of asset-strippers closing down a factory. Iris's story now comes to resemble something from the world of Dynasty or the Kennedys, with plutocrats found dead aboard yachts, privileged heiresses discovered with their necks broken in grimy houses, snaffled telegrams, renegade political activists and wrongful inheritances. For the reader, this uncontrollable proliferation of events makes for urgent, fast-paced narrative; but it also distracts and detracts from the novel's more subtle themes. </p> <p>Atwood has always sought to collapse and subvert different genres, so it isn't surprising that her family saga should encompass pulp sci-fi, clue-strewn detective novel, newspaper reportage and tragic confessional romance. The ingenuity of its chameleon narrative, and Atwood's assured handling of atmosphere, constitute an impressive attempt to cover an awful lot of ground - not least the whirlwind of social and political change that makes the sisters' rarefied childhood a dangerous anachronism - at the same time as exploring the hidden history of one family. The Blind Assassin also contains a sophisticated meditation on the uses and perils of fiction: this ushers in a daring ambiguity about the nature of authorship that ups the novel's ante and all but breaks the bank. What we have, at the end, is a mystery story whose chief character is absent. If Atwood hasn't quite managed to pull off this vanishing act, it is largely because her particular brand of fictional magic- making relies on stealth and invisibility; and in this novel we get a little too close to seeing how the trick is performed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cable group NTL yesterday announced a joint venture with Hollywood studio Universal for a film channel that will form part of the group's basic package of channels. The Studio has already signed a line-up of films including Born on the Fourth of July, Babe, The Flintstones and True Lies. The joint venture is part of NTL's aim to build its own content instead of relying too heavily on products from Sky, as well as generating additional revenues by selling the channels to other broadcasters. NTL owns British Eurosport, has the rights to pay-per-view Premiership football and is a shareholder in the ITN 24-hour news channel. It is also an investor in pay-per-view movie brand, Front Row, and is understood to be planning another sports channel. Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB has so far led the way, with the development of pay-TV channels in Britain. \"Content is critically important to us,\" said Steven Wagner, managing director of media and marketing at NTL. \"We want to be in the key genres of programming including movies, sport and news.\" The Studio will feature films from various producers in addition to Universal products. Mr Wagner said discussions were under way with other platforms including Sky Digital, ONdigital and Telewest to secure distribution deals. \"We are trying to expand our basic channel universe to get more people watching multi-channel TV, and then you have a very powerful way of cross-promoting premium channels,\" he added. Many of the movies will appear on premium pay channels between three and six months before reaching The Studio. The agreement gives Universal a second pay-TV business in Britain in addition to the Sci-fi Channel .",

Ministers must be seriously wondering whether it is worth investing the enormous political capital necessary to have a chance of persuading an increasingly sceptical nation of joining an organisation that Danes rejected. They did so despite an almost unified pro-euro campaign by government, opposition parties and industry. It was much less of a jump for them than us because Denmark's currency has been shadowing the euro and its predecessors for nearly 20 years. It is quite likely that euros will start circulating in Denmark since they will have virtually the same value as the Krone. All the same, it was a sobering reminder to Gordon Brown and Tony Blair that, for all their protestations that joining the euro is a matter of technical economics (meeting Mr Brown's five criteria), it is and will remain a profoundly political decision. Danes voted for all sorts of reasons from cocking a snook at the establishment to genuine scepticism about further integration. But there was also a strong element of nationality as Danes asked themselves a question beginning to be asked elsewhere in Europe: who are we and what control do we want to exercise over our own destinies?</p> <p>This is not to say that economic factors weren't important: if the euro had become the strong currency so many of its advocates predicted, it might have moved the votes of enough floating voters to swing the balance. For this reason, the economic circumstances in which a future Labour government would decide whether to hold a referendum could look more favourable for the euro than they do now. Forecasting foreign currency movements is notoriously difficult but there is nevertheless a strong chance that the circumstances which brought about the 25% collapse of the euro will be thrown dramatically into reverse. In this scenario the unexpectedly robust US economy (driven by the internet and high corporate profitability), which has sucked in huge capital flows from Europe, would slow down. This would bring down the value of the dollar, thereby boosting the lost value of the euro (which even the IMF regards as seriously undervalued). If the pound went down as the euro went up then the chronic loss of competitiveness that industry rightly complains about would be reversed. The worry here is not that the dollar will fall - that is almost bound to happen sooner or later - but that the credit-driven expansion of the US economy might go into free fall, triggering the crash that many pundits have been predicting for years but which has stubbornly refused to happen.

To ditch the euro now because of special circumstances in one small European country would hand a gift to the opposition that it would flaunt before ministers for years.

Mr O'Neill told Radio 4's World At One programme he had hoped the euro's decline would have been reversed thanks to last week's central bank intervention to put a floor under its fall. \"That has not happened. Until it happens, I think we will find that the Labour government is quite capable of saying we cannot risk a massive devaluation which would be required for us to harmonise with the euro, and that therefore there will be a continuing delay. Mr O'Neill added: \"The value of your currency is not a subjective economic test. It is one that is there for all to see. Unless there is a marked improvement in the value of the euro, I think it would be very difficult for people like myself who want us to join...quickly to advocate an accelerated process because it would mean devaluation and the threat of inflation.\" In Copenhagen, the aftermath of Thursday's referendum saw policymakers desperately trying to defend the krone from speculative attack. The government raised interest rates by half a percentage point to 5.6% and insisted that its commitment to Europe remained strong despite the resounding No to the single currency. \"We'll do all we can to safeguard our fixed currency link to the euro,\" said the prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, who led the Yes campaign in its defeat by 53.1% to 46.9%. Holger Nielsen, of the Socialist People's Party, said: \"The referendum has shown that there is a huge gap between law-makers and voters.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Danish referendum verdict was, in the words of one City analyst, one small step for Denmark, and one giant leap backwards for the single currency. The fall out in the market yesterday was small scale - the euro fell back below 88 cents to its lowest point for three days before recovering in late trading - but traders are bracing themselves for bigger quakes ahead. Senior eurozone policy makers yesterday attempted to shrug off the impact of the Danish decision to say no to the euro, but the European Central Bank president, Wim Duisenberg, could barely conceal his irritation that tiny Denmark had spurned his pride and joy, and warned that the Danes would lose out in the long term. \"The Danish people have chosen to deprive themselves of the benefits that Denmark would have derived from joining the euro such as an increase in the rate of growth and the welfare of the economy,\" he said. Analysts said the forex reaction to Thursday's referendum was muted yesterday because traders fear if they drive down the euro too far, the world's main central banks may stage a repeat of last Friday's surprise intervention in the market to prop up the currency. \"The only reason for the euro's buoyancy at the moment is that it is being kept afloat by market worries that it will be rapped across the knuckles with intervention again by the Group of Seven central banks,\" said David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns. But Mr Brown believes the veneer of G7 invincibility will wear thin in coming weeks as the shock to confidence in the currency from the referendum sinks in. The big worry for the euro's supporters is that the Danish no vote will cause a domino effect in at least two of the three other European members still outside the eurozone - Sweden, Britain and Greece. Athens is still likely to join - the euro may not be one of the world's rock solid currencies but the drachma's reputation is worse. Sweden, like Britain, must hold a referendum first. Sweden's prime minister, Goran Persson, yesterday did his best to play down the impact of the Danish result but will know in his heart that it will be all the more difficult for him to persuade his people to sign up to the euro now that Denmark has spurned it in such a public fashion. \"There is no rush. We have a good year ahead of us and we are not in a corner,\" he said. \"When our referendum comes, no one will talk about the Danish one.\" Mr Persson's ruling Social Democratic party declared its support for the single currency earlier this year but other parties in his coalition are anti-euro and he has said that a referendum will not take place until 2004 or 2005. As in Britain, public opinion is hostile, with polls showing that two in three Swedes are opposed to the euro. In fact, Thursday's decision raises the chances that the next countries to join the single currency after Greece may not even yet be members of the EU. Five countries are lining up to join the EU - the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. For new members no opt-outs are allowed - joining the union means joining the euro. Many of these countries are effectively running their currencies in \"lock step\" with the euro anyway, so the impact of joining on their economies will be limited. However, the effect on the euro of absorbing a wave of less than solid currencies is more uncertain. Some analysts believe that without solid economies like Britain and Sweden bolstering the mix, it is less likely that the would-be euro members from eastern Europe will be offered the chance to join. In that case, the whole euro project may have to return to the drawing board.",

Major manufacturers are launching ranges of their models which can run on liquid propane gas (LPG) or compressed natural gas (CNG) and hybrid cars that are a combination of electricity and petrol driven engines.</p> <p>And if you have a car that is less than 12 months old, the government may even give you some financial help towards the cost of converting it from a simple petrol engine to a dual fuel machine. The reason? Gas-powered cars are far cheaper to run and they are streets ahead of petrol in the clean burn, low emissions stakes. People in the know say they will be the cars of the future.</p> <p>Dual fuel cars have two tanks, one containing petrol and one containing either CNG or LPG. In theory, a car can run on gas alone and cars of the future probably will but, in the meantime, because there are not a large number of places where you can refuel on gas, you need a petrol tank in case you run out. That is all set to change, but more of that later.</p> <p>So, CNG - what's that? Compressed natural gas is the stuff you have piped into your home for cooking and central heating. Swedish manufacturer Volvo, which is big in the dual fuel car market, introduced the first CNG/petrol driven car to the UK in 1996. But CNG is proving less practical and less popular as an alternative fuel for the private motorist than LPG.</p> <p>Although CNG is cleaner in terms of emissions, it needs a much bigger tank which makes it less suitable for the small private car. At the moment there are only 13 CNG compressors in the UK, so there are very few places where you can refuel. Some councils and bus companies are using CNG vehicles and have their own high compression units installed which can fill up in three minutes.</p> <p>It is possible to have a compression unit in your own home, but because of mains pressure to private properties you need to fuel up your car overnight, which takes about seven hours. And the cost of a compressor at \u00a31,500 to \u00a32,000 is another turn-off.</p> <p>\"At the moment CNG is a niche player in the market,\" says Volvo's environmental manager John Pitts, \"but if the price of a home compressor came down then natural gas would become a big player.\"</p> <p>LPG is a different matter. Manufacturers are rolling out more and more LPG cars and in response fuel suppliers are bringing more and more fuel stations where you can buy it, on line. It is estimated that five new outlets open each week and there are now 500 in Britain with a target of 1,000 by the end of 2001. LPG works out at 39.9p a litre, as opposed to the average 84p a litre for petrol. The government takes a much lower rate of duty from LPG - 13.4p a litre, about 33% of the total price, and 61p a litre from petrol, about 76% of the price.</p> <p>BP Oil UK is building a network of LPG stations called BP Autogas - its Plymouth site was the UK's 500th, and opened a fortnight ago.</p> <p>\"We have 72 sites up and running and a further 12 in build at the moment with a target of 300 by the end of 2003,\" says spokesman Clive Kirkham. \"LPG makes sense because of the substantial financial savings and environmental benefits. The majority of car manufacturers are looking in this direction.\"</p> <p>British Gas, which supplies CNG and LPG, is working with Elf and Sainsbury's to supply to the private motorist.</p> <p>There are other advantages to running an LPG-fuelled car. Richard Wilson, head of direct services for Sevenoaks District Council in Kent, explains: \"Because LPG is a much cleaner fuel oil changes are every 15,000 miles, compared to 6,000 miles for a petrol engine, and engine tuning is every 40,000 miles instead of every 10,000 miles for a petrol engine.\"</p> <p>The council's fleet of seven LPG vans is used by pest control officers, the dog warden and parking attendants. \"We had no problems during the petrol crisis,\" says Wilson.</p> <p>Government backing for alternative fuel cars is another reason for the sudden upsurge in interest. Not only can you buy an LPG-fuelled car, but also it is possible to convert your vehicle if it is less than 12 months old and get a grant to do it.</p> <p>Powershift, which is funded by the Energy Savings Trust, aims to promote cleaner cars. With \u00a310m funding, Powershift will subsidise your conversion costs on a scale from 25% to 75% depending on the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. Powershift will also help fund the extra cost of buying a dual fuel car using the same criteria.</p> <p>Volvo is confident that its V40 range, due for launch at Christmas, will qualify for a 75% rebate on the \u00a31,800 estimated extra cost of the vehicle.

With lorry drivers and oil companies apparently reluctant to keep supplies moving in the face of opposition, few attempts were made to breach the blockades and the police were, in effect, powerless to intervene.</p> <p>Police were unable to effectively prevent go-slow protests on major routes as driving slowly is not illegal unless it is persistent. Video evidence or other proof is required before arrests can be made. The removal of hauliers' licences is also complex and could not be enforced overnight.</p> <p>The memorandum commits all parties to work together to ensure that fuel always reaches essential services, but contains no detail on how the police, criticised for a lack of action earlier this month, will change their approach to deal with future protests.</p> <p>With ministers considering extending civil duties legislation to oil companies, requiring them to ensure supply to users in the same way as the major utilities, the oil companies agreed to try to ensure their lorries got through future blockades. The home secretary, Jack Straw, conceded that the plan drawn up by the taskforce would not guarantee disruption-free supply of fuel.</p> <p>\"The idea of the memorandum is to ensure that every signatory - the oil companies, central government, the devolved administrations, the police, the trade unions - is involved in taking the necessary contingency action against possible future disruption,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Straw described the memorandum as a \"medium-term programme of work\" and said legal changes were being considered, to impose a civil duty on oil companies to keep supplies flowing, or to alter criminal laws on blockades. \"Changes in the law could not be introduced until the end of this year at the earliest,\" he said.</p> <p>He added: \"One difference we anticipate is that the speed and the scale of the response will be different.\"</p> <p>Under the taskforce plan, early warning systems would be put in place to alert authorities to the threat of protest; joint crisis management systems would be put in place and action would be taken to prevent intimidation of tanker drivers.</p> <p>Welcoming the move, Malcolm Brinded, chairman of Shell UK said: \"We are happy to commit to this memorandum. We have a great interest in maintaining continuity of oil supplies to all our customers and, like other signatories, will do all we can to minimise future disruption.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Police will not be used to break future fuel blockades in the way they were used to smash the miners' strike in the 1980s, under an agreement signed yesterday aimed at preventing a repeat of fuel shortages. The fuel supply taskforce yesterday released a memorandum of understanding aimed at preventing a repeat of last month's disruption to fuel supplies. Police had to rely on existing public order legislation during the demonstrations as they were not trade disputes and anti-picketing legislation did not apply. With lorry drivers and oil companies apparently reluctant to keep supplies moving in the face of opposition, few attempts were made to breach the blockades and the police were, in effect, powerless to intervene. Police were unable to effectively prevent go-slow protests on major routes as driving slowly is not illegal unless it is persistent. Video evidence or other proof is required before arrests can be made. The removal of hauliers' licences is also complex and could not be enforced overnight. The memorandum commits all parties to work together to ensure that fuel always reaches essential services, but contains no detail on how the police, criticised for a lack of action earlier this month, will change their approach to deal with future protests. With ministers considering extending civil duties legislation to oil companies, requiring them to ensure supply to users in the same way as the major utilities, the oil companies agreed to try to ensure their lorries got through future blockades. The home secretary, Jack Straw, conceded that the plan drawn up by the taskforce would not guarantee disruption-free supply of fuel. \"The idea of the memorandum is to ensure that every signatory - the oil companies, central government, the devolved administrations, the police, the trade unions - is involved in taking the necessary contingency action against possible future disruption,\" he said. Mr Straw described the memorandum as a \"medium-term programme of work\" and said legal changes were being considered, to impose a civil duty on oil companies to keep supplies flowing, or to alter criminal laws on blockades. \"Changes in the law could not be introduced until the end of this year at the earliest,\" he said. He added: \"One difference we anticipate is that the speed and the scale of the response will be different.\" Under the taskforce plan, early warning systems would be put in place to alert authorities to the threat of protest; joint crisis management systems would be put in place and action would be taken to prevent intimidation of tanker drivers. Welcoming the move, Malcolm Brinded, chairman of Shell UK said: \"We are happy to commit to this memorandum. We have a great interest in maintaining continuity of oil supplies to all our customers and, like other signatories, will do all we can to minimise future disruption.\"",

      "body": "<p>In my capacity as editor of a men's fashion magazine, I was once invited onto Radio 5's breakfast programme and asked to explain why David Beckham would want to wear a skirt. The dolts. If you're in any way fashion-minded, you'll know of course it was a sarong, not a skirt. Duuuhh. Plus, Becksy was on holiday in the south of France, not popping to the shops in Salford. Did you wear this summer's Speedos/sombrero/flip-flops combo when you got back home? Like hell you did.</p> <p>So why all the fuss? Because men wearing \"women's\" clothes excites uproar among the average British male. Millions of south-east Asian males happily wear sarongs every day, and do people get dragged from their beds to explain why?</p> <p>It's a cultural thing. We live in a trussed-up, hemmed-in society that frowns on men wearing skirts, yet giggles itself split-sides when they go the whole hog and actually dress like a woman. And I'm not just talking about Lily Savage, Dame Edna, Hinge &amp; Brackett, and that new and surprising Super Noodles ad. All ships in the Royal Navy's submarine fleet keep a wardrobe of women's outfits on-board. Correct-a-mundo - the Ents committee will don frocks to cheer up the crew in times of gloom. </p> <p>Like the poor, drag-stars have always been with us. From music hall to panto, to It Ain't Half Hot, Mum to The Rocky Horror Picture Show (Jason Donovan obviously enjoyed playing Frank'N'Furter - he stars as a tranny DJ in Sorted, which opens on Friday). Yes, cocks in frocks is as British as heart disease and gout. Dear God, even some of our finest have stooped. See Alec Guinness in Kind Hearts and Coronets or Terence Stamp in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.</p> <p>Now prepare to be captivated by the latest batch, this time with an American flavour. Described as Danny La Rue meets Meat Loaf on speed, Hedwig Schmidt is the central character of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, a new rock musical about a Berlin transsexual that opened in London last week. The show has gone down a storm in the States, with celebs tripping over themselves to get a seat, and a film version is now in production. If you can't wait for that to hit our screens, look out for Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, where Eddie Murphy takes on a range of female roles.</p> <p>Early next year, Johnny Depp will be with us in Before Night Falls, playing Bon Bon, a boa-wearing floozy with a blonde bob and what Variety magazine alarmingly describes as \"a talent for rectal smuggling\". Hot on his kitten heels comes Mel Gibson, donning slinky underwear and doing the full leg-wax thing in What Women Want. Then there's Philip Seymour Hoffman piling on the sequins to lead a drag troupe in Flawless.</p> <p>So what's the appeal? Go on, ask yourself. What's so clever about a man dressed as a woman? I put this to dozens of mates and there were blank faces all round. Let me put words to this blankness: THERE'S NOTHING CLEVER ABOUT IT, that's what.</p> <p>It's not sexy; I don't know a woman who thinks it a turn-on. It's not funny, as such. Well, it is for the first nanosecond - Ho, ho! Doesn't Des Lynam look silly in that outfit? Five minutes later: yawn. It is simply tired, sad and desperate.</p> <p>Yet when I return to my same friends and ask who their favourite man-dressed-as-woman is, the blank faces light up. Giggles, anecdotes and impressions gush forth. Everyone has their favourite tranny moment. These can be categorised as comedy-drag, bad-drag, mad-drag and alarmingly convincing-drag.</p> <p>In the comedy category, for me it has to be the be-curlered Les Dawson doing his northern housewife bit, hoiking up his right tit and silently mouthing the tastiest bits of the latest gossip. Contesting the next three places I'd have Melvyn Hayes in It Ain't Half Hot, Mum, Charles Hawtrey infiltrating the Fakir's harem in his specs-and-veil in Carry On Up the Khyber and Dick Emery's \"You Are Awful, But I Like You\". Klinger's hairy-legged bid for mental discharge in M*A*S*H takes the special Best International Award.</p> <p>Bad-drag is easy. If Klinger wasn't so funny he'd be in with a bullet. Mrs Doubtfire is good because it caused fat, grumpy golfer Colin Montgomerie a whole load of embarrassment. And then there's the bad-drag buddy sub-category, where two men alternate between liking and loathing their get-ups.</p> <p>Some Like it Hot with Marilyn Monroe is the clear pick here. Tony Curtis's purposefully poor attempt plays against the superb Jack Lemmon, in turns both hilarious and convincing. Especially the bit where he returns in the morning, maracas in hand, having accepted an offer of marriage. Class. Eric Idle and Robbie Coltrane were dreadful in Nuns On The Run. And the name escapes me, but the film that saw Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes getting into dresses was very, very bad. All four of the latter should be taken outside and bull-whipped.</p> <p>Mad-drag? Simple. Norman Bates in Psycho. That bloke in The Silence Of The Lambs scared the living bejesus out of me, but I could barely make out what he was wearing. At this point, I must explain that I choose not to include Ed Wood, Eddie Izzard and ex-Dexy Kevin Rowland in any of these lists because I believe them to be wearers of individual women's clothes. Not ensembles. There is a difference, dammit. Angora feels nice.</p> <p>The final category is the one that generates the most heated response. For your bog-standard straight bloke, men-that-look-alarmingly-good-dressed-as-women are devil-sent. FHM recently ran a feature on Thai chick-boys, and I know of several fellas in this office who rushed into looking at the pictures before reading the explanatory copy. Their whistles of admiration will shame their cheeks for eternity.</p> <p>Terence Stamp in Priscilla, Ru Paul, Queen drummer Roger Taylor in the video for I Want To Break Free, Stephen Dorff's Candy Girl and Lou Reed on the cover of Transformer are all too good. As, I expect, will be Depp's Bon Bon. For the life of me I can't remember the storyline to The Crying Game (the IRA were in it? You're kidding me!), but I'll never forget \"the penis scene\" and hundreds of heads bolting back in their chairs as the dress dropped. Mercifully, Les Dawson always kept the dress on. </p> <p>\u0095 Nutty Professor II: The Klumps opens on Friday; Some Like it Hot has a limited rerelease on Oct 20; Hedwig And The Angry Inch is at The Playhouse, Northumberland Avenue, London WC2</p>",

And I'm not just talking about Lily Savage, Dame Edna, Hinge &amp; Brackett, and that new and surprising Super Noodles ad. All ships in the Royal Navy's submarine fleet keep a wardrobe of women's outfits on-board. Correct-a-mundo - the Ents committee will don frocks to cheer up the crew in times of gloom. Like the poor, drag-stars have always been with us. From music hall to panto, to It Ain't Half Hot, Mum to The Rocky Horror Picture Show (Jason Donovan obviously enjoyed playing Frank'N'Furter - he stars as a tranny DJ in Sorted, which opens on Friday). Yes, cocks in frocks is as British as heart disease and gout. Dear God, even some of our finest have stooped. See Alec Guinness in Kind Hearts and Coronets or Terence Stamp in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Now prepare to be captivated by the latest batch, this time with an American flavour. Described as Danny La Rue meets Meat Loaf on speed, Hedwig Schmidt is the central character of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, a new rock musical about a Berlin transsexual that opened in London last week. The show has gone down a storm in the States, with celebs tripping over themselves to get a seat, and a film version is now in production. If you can't wait for that to hit our screens, look out for Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, where Eddie Murphy takes on a range of female roles. Early next year, Johnny Depp will be with us in Before Night Falls, playing Bon Bon, a boa-wearing floozy with a blonde bob and what Variety magazine alarmingly describes as \"a talent for rectal smuggling\". Hot on his kitten heels comes Mel Gibson, donning slinky underwear and doing the full leg-wax thing in What Women Want. Then there's Philip Seymour Hoffman piling on the sequins to lead a drag troupe in Flawless. So what's the appeal? Go on, ask yourself. What's so clever about a man dressed as a woman? I put this to dozens of mates and there were blank faces all round. Let me put words to this blankness: THERE'S NOTHING CLEVER ABOUT IT, that's what. It's not sexy; I don't know a woman who thinks it a turn-on. It's not funny, as such. Well, it is for the first nanosecond - Ho, ho! Doesn't Des Lynam look silly in that outfit? Five minutes later: yawn. It is simply tired, sad and desperate. Yet when I return to my same friends and ask who their favourite man-dressed-as-woman is, the blank faces light up. Giggles, anecdotes and impressions gush forth. Everyone has their favourite tranny moment. These can be categorised as comedy-drag, bad-drag, mad-drag and alarmingly convincing-drag. In the comedy category, for me it has to be the be-curlered Les Dawson doing his northern housewife bit, hoiking up his right tit and silently mouthing the tastiest bits of the latest gossip. Contesting the next three places I'd have Melvyn Hayes in It Ain't Half Hot, Mum, Charles Hawtrey infiltrating the Fakir's harem in his specs-and-veil in Carry On Up the Khyber and Dick Emery's \"You Are Awful, But I Like You\". Klinger's hairy-legged bid for mental discharge in M*A*S*H takes the special Best International Award. Bad-drag is easy. If Klinger wasn't so funny he'd be in with a bullet. Mrs Doubtfire is good because it caused fat, grumpy golfer Colin Montgomerie a whole load of embarrassment. And then there's the bad-drag buddy sub-category, where two men alternate between liking and loathing their get-ups. Some Like it Hot with Marilyn Monroe is the clear pick here. Tony Curtis's purposefully poor attempt plays against the superb Jack Lemmon, in turns both hilarious and convincing. Especially the bit where he returns in the morning, maracas in hand, having accepted an offer of marriage. Class. Eric Idle and Robbie Coltrane were dreadful in Nuns On The Run. And the name escapes me, but the film that saw Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes getting into dresses was very, very bad. All four of the latter should be taken outside and bull-whipped. Mad-drag? Simple. Norman Bates in Psycho. That bloke in The Silence Of The Lambs scared the living bejesus out of me, but I could barely make out what he was wearing. At this point, I must explain that I choose not to include Ed Wood, Eddie Izzard and ex-Dexy Kevin Rowland in any of these lists because I believe them to be wearers of individual women's clothes. Not ensembles. There is a difference, dammit. Angora feels nice. The final category is the one that generates the most heated response. For your bog-standard straight bloke, men-that-look-alarmingly-good-dressed-as-women are devil-sent. FHM recently ran a feature on Thai chick-boys, and I know of several fellas in this office who rushed into looking at the pictures before reading the explanatory copy. Their whistles of admiration will shame their cheeks for eternity. Terence Stamp in Priscilla, Ru Paul, Queen drummer Roger Taylor in the video for I Want To Break Free, Stephen Dorff's Candy Girl and Lou Reed on the cover of Transformer are all too good. As, I expect, will be Depp's Bon Bon. For the life of me I can't remember the storyline to The Crying Game (the IRA were in it? You're kidding me!), but I'll never forget \"the penis scene\" and hundreds of heads bolting back in their chairs as the dress dropped. Mercifully, Les Dawson always kept the dress on. \u0095 Nutty Professor II: The Klumps opens on Friday; Some Like it Hot has a limited rerelease on Oct 20; Hedwig And The Angry Inch is at The Playhouse, Northumberland Avenue, London WC2",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Brian Keenan recalls every moment of his release from captivity in Beirut. How, after four and a half years chained to a wall in cells never more than six foot by four, they came to him, out of the blue - \"You go home Braham.\" They had always confused his name, calling him a mixture of Abraham and Brian. How they tricked him out of saying goodbye to his friend, fellow hostage John McCarthy - \"Later, later you see him\" - then bundled him into a car and took him blindfolded, his head on one guard's lap. \"And him stroking my face.\" First to one room, where he tried to leave a message in a book, writing with a burnt-out match. Then, in another car, to the hills above the city, where Keenan was passed over to the Syrians. As they walked towards the Syrians, the young guard held his hand - not roughly, but like they were mates. Two people who would not meet again. \"I guess they are all dead now. I don't say that with relish. And I don't know it for sure. But it's what I imagine.\" </p> <p>At the Dutch Embassy in Damascus, after a two-day debriefing by the Syrians, they treated him lavishly, like a returning hero. He was offered anything he wanted. What he wanted, he said, was first an Irish coffee and then some chocolate and an ice cream. \"Which is odd, because I don't even like chocolate.\" Kids' comfort food. But they brought him a full-blown meal, anyway. \"Insisted on it\" - knowing, or thinking they knew, better than he what a man who had endured so much deprivation must desire. \"I couldn't eat a thing.\" </p> <p>And so it began. His re-emergence into a world he thought he knew, the world he had left behind, but different now. Not so much because the world had changed, or even because he himself had changed. But because his place in the world had changed. He went into the cell Brian Keenan, an unknown university teacher from Belfast. He then became Brian Keenan, the disappeared. </p> <p>\"Not to myself. To myself I never disappeared, I knew exactly where I was.\" Crucial, this. All the time that the world knew nothing of his existence, he hadn't ceased to exist, though he had transposed worlds. His reality, confined though it was, was his own. He didn't look outside. \"My recollection is that if you focus on the real world, which isn't your real world, because your world is here in your head, then you are going to make life very difficult.\" </p> <p>In his account of this time, An Evil Cradling, he describes \"a world in which nothing happens, and yet everything happens\", and his struggle to retain control over this world. Now, he says, \"In these conditions the mind opens up.\" As if the external constraints somehow operate to remove inner constraints. \"You are in the dark, there are no windows, you can't see. But, tiny and oppressive as it is, you find in your mind ways to push the walls back.\" What he's describing is kind of liberation. It's a paradox he is well aware of - that in captivity he was somehow free. And yes, he says, there have been times when he has wanted to go back there. \"Because the mind was so lucid and so fascinating. But, of course, I am not going back.\" </p> <p>He came out and the world embraced him and he became Brian Keenan the man from Beirut. Not his choice. He describes his arrival back in Dublin, on a private government jet, as a series of baffled sensations. The noise. \"People in the viewing gallery cheering.\" The sudden lights. \"Flashing cameras. I was blinded.\" The red carpet under his feet. \"I instinctively stepped off it. I hadn't walked on a carpet in over four years. Charles Haughey, the Irish prime minister of the day, pulled me back on.\" </p> <p>Later, in the hospital where he was sent for routine tests, he suddenly noticed that the walls were the same colour as the last place he had been held. He asked a friend to get him out. The world's press was waiting for him at the hospital doors. \"So Frank suggested taking me out in the boot of his car. And that's how we did it.\" He laughs because of the obvious irony - as though he'd been hijacked again. Which, in a way, he had. Caught in the captive glare of fame. </p> <p>He hates it, and he hasn't got used to it. \"It embarrasses me.\" A shy, modest man, he accepts it when people come up to him in the pub, offering him drinks, asking to shake his hand. He is polite and politely unimpressed. He doesn't want this fame. \"I don't really understand it. What have I done? I didn't ask to be kidnapped.\" </p> <p>He talks about a letter he received recently from a woman whose daughter is dying of leukaemia. \"There's far more heroism in that woman than there will ever be in me.\" Now, he says, he turns down offers to speak about his experience. \"It's the past. Why would I want to do that?\" He has always refused to go to America to lecture. \"I am asked and I say, 'No.'\" Money couldn't tempt him. \"Money has always been the last thing on my mind. Though I don't have a lot of it. I have to work, my wife has to work.\" </p> <p>Stubbornly - it is stubbornness that he considers his principal trait - he has resisted having an identity foisted on him. And this has served him well. But intransigence, as he points out, can carry its own terrible consequences. \"If I believe something, I believe it passionately and no one will change it. It's awful. I am old enough to know better, old enough to rationalise things. But, with me, belief has to be a hundred per cent.\" So he can understand, he says, what happened in Beirut. \"The ramifications of that sort of belief. Why they took hostages. How they came to murder six people. I don't approve. But I can understand it.\" </p> <p>John McCarthy once explained to me how between them they developed a way of dealing with the guards. \"Brian would confront them, refuse to give in to their ludicrous little demands. Make a stand. Then I would negotiate away from this ...\" And, as with the guards, Keenan is not renowned for his easy co-operation. No one could persuade him, after he came out, to write his memoirs before he was ready. \"I had decided I would not write a book until everyone was out. They would all have their own stories, no way would I pre-empt anyone by getting in first.\" And if some of them hadn't come home? \"Maybe I would still have written it, but I would have asked the families first. I would have had to. I couldn't have lived with myself if I had caused any hurt, because then I would have become my own little terrorist.\" </p> <p>He had to wait a year before McCarthy was released in August 1991. And almost six months more before first Terry Waite, in November 1991, and then Terry Anderson, a month later, were released. These must have been terrible times for him. \"No,\" he says, \"not really. I worried at first, but I was always confident they would come home.\" Even after he knew about the deaths of the Americans? \"I can't remember,\" he says, \"when I found out that the Americans had been killed.\" He wrote in An Evil Cradling, and he reiterates now, that he felt bad about leaving McCarthy alone. He still thinks about it, and is not clear in his mind if he did the wrong thing. Though he had no choice, there was a mutual debt between them. That's what he learned in captivity, he says. </p> <p>\"That survival is mutual. Everyone there had to put a part of themselves on the table for everyone else to take what they needed.\" So, until the debt was clear, he would not be free to act. He is a very unusual man, in many ways no doubt. But in one way in particular. He is not prepared to be cynical. Unmodern, you could say, in that way. </p> <p> There is some irony but no coincidence that Keenan was born in Belfast - \"the most political city I have ever been in\". His personality was formed in that divide - the weight of one group oppressively bearing down on another. He was brought up a Protestant. \"For what that's worth.\" And he was 18 when the Troubles started in 1968. \"I suppose I could have got caught up in it. If I'd been a bit younger, had less of a head on my shoulders, I could have been locked up in a prison in Belfast rather than in Beirut.\" </p> <p>His mother, a housewife, used to say to him: \"Politics stops at your doorstep.\" \"But I never knew if she meant coming in or going out.\" His father was a telephone engineer and before that he worked on the buses. A sweet man. \"I remember him bringing home all these injured animals he'd find on the road and mum telling him to get them out.\" </p> <p>Keenan took his destiny in his hands, dropping out of the plumber's apprenticeship he started, getting himself to university to read English literature, and then becoming a teacher: the only kid in his street, as he has often said - and not in a self- congratulatory manner - to do so. </p> <p>Though he loves Belfast, he kept trying to get out. He lived in Spain, in Brussels, did a community care course in Aberdeen. But he kept going back. \"It's my city, my home and things were happening.\" But by the mid-80s, he'd had enough. \"Belfast was falling apart.\" He had given up teaching, \"because what the kids needed to learn they were learning on the streets and not in my classroom. And maybe they were right about that. WB Yeats wasn't going to get them through it.\" </p> <p>Community work was more frustrating. \"Because, whatever you tried to do, it just came back to politicians fighting and bitching.\" He was 34, \"very discontent\", so he made a plan to go to Australia via Beirut, where he had a contract in the American University to work for one year. He knew Beirut was a dangerous place. But then, from anyone's perspective, so was Belfast. He almost changed his mind. \"I suddenly felt very apprehensive.\" Then the stubbornness kicked in. \"And I am afraid of being afraid.\" So he made himself go. </p> <p>Keenan is an odd mixture of the literal and the intensely poetic - both these helped to preserve him in prison. He used his willpower and his practical intelligence to make what sense he could of what was happening to him - he could kid himself for only a few days that they'd let him out as soon as they found he was an Irishman. And, as he has said, he used his imagination to escape into himself. Alone, for five months, he invented or rather elaborated a character, Turlough O'Carolan, Ireland's national musician, a 17th-century itinerant blind harpist, who became his companion. A strange choice, you might think, when he could have imagined some sexy seductress. But, as he knew, or was beginning to know, survival depended somehow on suspending desire, not promoting it. Men in prison, he says, think of sex far less than you'd believe. \"That's an invention from movies. The men I knew in captivity didn't talk about sex much at all.\" They couldn't bear to. </p> <p>O'Carolan became his companion. A way of distancing himself from what was happening to him. He helped to keep him sane. Psychiatrists, Keenan says, would probably have declared him clinically insane for much of this time. \"And they may be right. But they may also be wrong.\" For Keenan, Turlough was a lifeline and he made a deal with himself. When he came out, if he came out, he would commit himself to two tasks. He would build a house on the west coast of Ireland, which he has done: a traditional cottage with the view out of one window of Clare Island and out of the other a view of Croagh Patrick, the holiest mountain in Ireland. And he would write a book, a novel, about this man who came to him in his cell and would comfort him. </p> <p>Someone, trying to be clever, once said that the Irish are sentimental about causes but never about people. Keenan is a living rebuke to this. The only debts he wants to repay are to people - those who have helped him. In spite of his temper, which he says is terrific, his passion and his conviction, he seems utterly without vengeance. Anyway, he kept to his deal - built first the cottage and then set about writing the book. \"It was a debt of honour,\" he says. \"I was doing it for him and for me. To get the monkey off my back.\" </p> <p>It was almost impossible, he says. He couldn't find a way of inhabiting Turlough's head. \"I am no historian, I am musically illiterate, I can't play the harp. I am not blind.\" And apart from this he had never written a work of fiction. Quite simply, he didn't know how to do it. He'd start, chuck it in. Start again. He couldn't get rid of it. He was invited to give a lecture in Alaska on writing. It seemed a good place to go to get away, but even here he found himself talking about Turlough. </p> <p> Some time after he got home to Ireland, he received a letter from an Inuit woman who had heard him speak. He could hardly make out her name and she didn't give an address. \"I always reply to people who write to me however mad they may seem.\" She told him that Turlough is what is known in native American mythology as a dreamwalker. \"Someone who inhabits dreams, who sees in his dreams. Who has, what this woman called, blindsightedness.\" Keenan thought she was nuts. But then she wrote again, and again no address. And as she explained more about dreamwalkers in her letter, he began to see a way through to the man. </p> <p>What was known about Turlough was his music, his art. He is honoured and revered by many musicians through the centuries, in contemporary times particularly by the Chieftains, who have been playing Turlough's music for 30 years. Yet nothing was known \"of Turlough's head and his heart\". </p> <p>This is the book Keenan has written. An imaginative exploration of the man. Another kind of cradling, you could say, though this time benevolent. Keenan visits Turlough on his deathbed, comes into the room where he is dying, much as Turlough came to him in his room when he was in despair. And through Keenan's book Turlough is reborn not as a musician, not as a historical character, but as a man. \"Fleshy, honest, frail, complex.\" And if this sounds like a self-portrait, it may be that, too. There are echoes here, too, of Eliot's lines in his great poem Journey Of The Magi: \"I had seen birth and death/ But had thought they were different; this birth was/ Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.\" And ... \"I should be glad of another death.\" </p> <p>In allowing himself this other death, Keenan himself is reborn. He doesn't see it this way, couldn't be expected to - rejecting as he always has the identity of the man from Beirut. But it is there in the parallels between the two men: the sensory deprivation; the interior journey; Turlough's estrangement from his own background - he comes out of the peasant community and is taken up by the Irish ruling class as their itinerant minstrel - much as the west would have had Keenan play its tune. And all this, as Keenan says, at one of the most brutal times in Irish history, the late 17th century, when the Protestant ascendancy finally crushed the Catholic opposition. </p> <p>\"It marked the end of old Ireland, the end of the Gaelic order, when everything was taken from us, even our language was taken from us. If the term ethnic cleansing has any meaning, it was there in Ireland three centuries before it was manifest in eastern Europe.\" </p> <p>Much as Turlough was able to reconcile his two worlds - Ireland the physical place with all its history, \"which, though he couldn't see what was going on around him, he could sense\", and his own inner life, through music - this book becomes Keenan's reconciliation, the means finally by which he can take control again of his own destiny. You could also say that it signals Ireland's destiny - which is not English control. \"I do believe that this island should be one land.\" All of which makes it a bold book. Keenan is nervous, he says. \"It hasn't gone out to the public yet. I think that maybe the people who have read my books before will find this a strange departure.\" But then this is, of course, its point. </p> <p>When he was in the cell, he tried not not to think about love, and when he came out he wasn't ready to. \"Coming out of that place, where there was so little in the way of affection, I was very aware that I could just fall into something.\" So he took his time, went off to live in a house in County Mayo lent to him by a priest. \"I'd never met him, but he wrote to me offering the house.\" It was away from the media, there was no phone, no television. \"No one could find me there.\" And he started to think and eventually to put on to tape his experience of those four years. One day, he was playing it back to himself, \"and I realised I was just weeping, it all came flooding out, like Vesuvius. There I was listening to this man, who was me, talking out that cell, the tears streaming down my face.\" He remembers the day. It was, he says, exactly nine months after he came out. That's how long it took to give birth to the human being again. </p> <p>It was soon after this that he rang Audrey, a physiotherapist he had met while he was in hospital. \"I had rather cheekily taken her number from one of the duty rosters.\" Five years ago, they married and they now have two sons, Jack, three and Colum, 10 months. \"People say Colum is a Scots name. But it's not. It's an old Irish name that was stolen by the Scots.\" </p> <p>He wasn't sure about fatherhood. \"I was anxious, still am. I thought, at 45, I was too old. But they are nice kids, lovely people.\" And tall, both of them are going to be over six foot. \"As a small person I always wanted to be tall.\" When he was, his mum used to say to him, \"'Be careful with what you want, you may get it.' So, she was right. I did get it.\" </p> <p>In his book he writes. \"It is memory that ages us not time.\" The mind forgets nothing, he says. \"I may forget things, but the mind doesn't.\" In captivity he found himself remembering details from his childhood, things that he didn't even know he knew. \"I could smell the linoleum in the house I grew up in. I could feel, twirl in my hand, the earrings that my mother wore when I was a child and she'd carry me in her arms.\" So he knows, however much he says, what happened in Beirut is the past. \"It's like a book I can take down from a shelf and read it and replace.\" </p> <p>Beirut is part of him. Next week he is coming to London to see Terry Anderson, who is over from the States. Soon after, John McCarthy is going to Dublin to celebrate Keenan's 50th birthday. \"Audrey said we have to do something, so that's what we're doing.\" So he says he is not the anti-social melancholic he has sometimes been cast as. \"I have a lot of friends. And I made sure of holding on to all the friendships I had in Belfast before I became famous.\" What he is saying here and in his book is that there is not one past, but many different pasts. Pasts before Beirut to which he also owes a debt </p> <p> \u0095 Turlough, by Brian Keenan, will be published by Jonathan Cape on October 5, priced \u00a316.99.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Brian Keenan recalls every moment of his release from captivity in Beirut. How, after four and a half years chained to a wall in cells never more than six foot by four, they came to him, out of the blue - \"You go home Braham.\" They had always confused his name, calling him a mixture of Abraham and Brian. How they tricked him out of saying goodbye to his friend, fellow hostage John McCarthy - \"Later, later you see him\" - then bundled him into a car and took him blindfolded, his head on one guard's lap. \"And him stroking my face.\" First to one room, where he tried to leave a message in a book, writing with a burnt-out match. Then, in another car, to the hills above the city, where Keenan was passed over to the Syrians. As they walked towards the Syrians, the young guard held his hand - not roughly, but like they were mates. Two people who would not meet again. \"I guess they are all dead now. I don't say that with relish. And I don't know it for sure. But it's what I imagine.\" At the Dutch Embassy in Damascus, after a two-day debriefing by the Syrians, they treated him lavishly, like a returning hero. He was offered anything he wanted. What he wanted, he said, was first an Irish coffee and then some chocolate and an ice cream. \"Which is odd, because I don't even like chocolate.\" Kids' comfort food. But they brought him a full-blown meal, anyway. \"Insisted on it\" - knowing, or thinking they knew, better than he what a man who had endured so much deprivation must desire. \"I couldn't eat a thing.\" And so it began. His re-emergence into a world he thought he knew, the world he had left behind, but different now. Not so much because the world had changed, or even because he himself had changed. But because his place in the world had changed. He went into the cell Brian Keenan, an unknown university teacher from Belfast. He then became Brian Keenan, the disappeared. \"Not to myself. To myself I never disappeared, I knew exactly where I was.\" Crucial, this. All the time that the world knew nothing of his existence, he hadn't ceased to exist, though he had transposed worlds. His reality, confined though it was, was his own. He didn't look outside. \"My recollection is that if you focus on the real world, which isn't your real world, because your world is here in your head, then you are going to make life very difficult.\" In his account of this time, An Evil Cradling, he describes \"a world in which nothing happens, and yet everything happens\", and his struggle to retain control over this world. Now, he says, \"In these conditions the mind opens up.\" As if the external constraints somehow operate to remove inner constraints. \"You are in the dark, there are no windows, you can't see. But, tiny and oppressive as it is, you find in your mind ways to push the walls back.\" What he's describing is kind of liberation. It's a paradox he is well aware of - that in captivity he was somehow free. And yes, he says, there have been times when he has wanted to go back there. \"Because the mind was so lucid and so fascinating. But, of course, I am not going back.\" He came out and the world embraced him and he became Brian Keenan the man from Beirut. Not his choice. He describes his arrival back in Dublin, on a private government jet, as a series of baffled sensations. The noise. \"People in the viewing gallery cheering.\" The sudden lights. \"Flashing cameras. I was blinded.\" The red carpet under his feet. \"I instinctively stepped off it. I hadn't walked on a carpet in over four years. Charles Haughey, the Irish prime minister of the day, pulled me back on.\" Later, in the hospital where he was sent for routine tests, he suddenly noticed that the walls were the same colour as the last place he had been held. He asked a friend to get him out. The world's press was waiting for him at the hospital doors. \"So Frank suggested taking me out in the boot of his car. And that's how we did it.\" He laughs because of the obvious irony - as though he'd been hijacked again. Which, in a way, he had. Caught in the captive glare of fame. He hates it, and he hasn't got used to it. \"It embarrasses me.\" A shy, modest man, he accepts it when people come up to him in the pub, offering him drinks, asking to shake his hand. He is polite and politely unimpressed. He doesn't want this fame. \"I don't really understand it. What have I done? I didn't ask to be kidnapped.\" He talks about a letter he received recently from a woman whose daughter is dying of leukaemia. \"There's far more heroism in that woman than there will ever be in me.\" Now, he says, he turns down offers to speak about his experience. \"It's the past. Why would I want to do that?\" He has always refused to go to America to lecture. \"I am asked and I say, 'No.'\" Money couldn't tempt him. \"Money has always been the last thing on my mind. Though I don't have a lot of it. I have to work, my wife has to work.\" Stubbornly - it is stubbornness that he considers his principal trait - he has resisted having an identity foisted on him. And this has served him well. But intransigence, as he points out, can carry its own terrible consequences. \"If I believe something, I believe it passionately and no one will change it. It's awful. I am old enough to know better, old enough to rationalise things. But, with me, belief has to be a hundred per cent.\" So he can understand, he says, what happened in Beirut. \"The ramifications of that sort of belief. Why they took hostages. How they came to murder six people. I don't approve. But I can understand it.\" John McCarthy once explained to me how between them they developed a way of dealing with the guards. \"Brian would confront them, refuse to give in to their ludicrous little demands. Make a stand. Then I would negotiate away from this ...\" And, as with the guards, Keenan is not renowned for his easy co-operation. No one could persuade him, after he came out, to write his memoirs before he was ready. \"I had decided I would not write a book until everyone was out. They would all have their own stories, no way would I pre-empt anyone by getting in first.\" And if some of them hadn't come home? \"Maybe I would still have written it, but I would have asked the families first. I would have had to. I couldn't have lived with myself if I had caused any hurt, because then I would have become my own little terrorist.\" He had to wait a year before McCarthy was released in August 1991. And almost six months more before first Terry Waite, in November 1991, and then Terry Anderson, a month later, were released. These must have been terrible times for him. \"No,\" he says, \"not really. I worried at first, but I was always confident they would come home.\" Even after he knew about the deaths of the Americans? \"I can't remember,\" he says, \"when I found out that the Americans had been killed.\" He wrote in An Evil Cradling, and he reiterates now, that he felt bad about leaving McCarthy alone. He still thinks about it, and is not clear in his mind if he did the wrong thing. Though he had no choice, there was a mutual debt between them. That's what he learned in captivity, he says. \"That survival is mutual. Everyone there had to put a part of themselves on the table for everyone else to take what they needed.\" So, until the debt was clear, he would not be free to act. He is a very unusual man, in many ways no doubt. But in one way in particular. He is not prepared to be cynical. Unmodern, you could say, in that way. There is some irony but no coincidence that Keenan was born in Belfast - \"the most political city I have ever been in\". His personality was formed in that divide - the weight of one group oppressively bearing down on another. He was brought up a Protestant. \"For what that's worth.\" And he was 18 when the Troubles started in 1968. \"I suppose I could have got caught up in it. If I'd been a bit younger, had less of a head on my shoulders, I could have been locked up in a prison in Belfast rather than in Beirut.\" His mother, a housewife, used to say to him: \"Politics stops at your doorstep.\" \"But I never knew if she meant coming in or going out.\" His father was a telephone engineer and before that he worked on the buses. A sweet man. \"I remember him bringing home all these injured animals he'd find on the road and mum telling him to get them out.\" Keenan took his destiny in his hands, dropping out of the plumber's apprenticeship he started, getting himself to university to read English literature, and then becoming a teacher: the only kid in his street, as he has often said - and not in a self- congratulatory manner - to do so. Though he loves Belfast, he kept trying to get out. He lived in Spain, in Brussels, did a community care course in Aberdeen. But he kept going back. \"It's my city, my home and things were happening.\" But by the mid-80s, he'd had enough. \"Belfast was falling apart.\" He had given up teaching, \"because what the kids needed to learn they were learning on the streets and not in my classroom. And maybe they were right about that. WB Yeats wasn't going to get them through it.\" Community work was more frustrating. \"Because, whatever you tried to do, it just came back to politicians fighting and bitching.\" He was 34, \"very discontent\", so he made a plan to go to Australia via Beirut, where he had a contract in the American University to work for one year. He knew Beirut was a dangerous place. But then, from anyone's perspective, so was Belfast. He almost changed his mind. \"I suddenly felt very apprehensive.\" Then the stubbornness kicked in. \"And I am afraid of being afraid.\" So he made himself go. Keenan is an odd mixture of the literal and the intensely poetic - both these helped to preserve him in prison. He used his willpower and his practical intelligence to make what sense he could of what was happening to him - he could kid himself for only a few days that they'd let him out as soon as they found he was an Irishman. And, as he has said, he used his imagination to escape into himself. Alone, for five months, he invented or rather elaborated a character, Turlough O'Carolan, Ireland's national musician, a 17th-century itinerant blind harpist, who became his companion. A strange choice, you might think, when he could have imagined some sexy seductress. But, as he knew, or was beginning to know, survival depended somehow on suspending desire, not promoting it. Men in prison, he says, think of sex far less than you'd believe. \"That's an invention from movies. The men I knew in captivity didn't talk about sex much at all.\" They couldn't bear to. O'Carolan became his companion. A way of distancing himself from what was happening to him. He helped to keep him sane. Psychiatrists, Keenan says, would probably have declared him clinically insane for much of this time. \"And they may be right. But they may also be wrong.\" For Keenan, Turlough was a lifeline and he made a deal with himself. When he came out, if he came out, he would commit himself to two tasks. He would build a house on the west coast of Ireland, which he has done: a traditional cottage with the view out of one window of Clare Island and out of the other a view of Croagh Patrick, the holiest mountain in Ireland. And he would write a book, a novel, about this man who came to him in his cell and would comfort him. Someone, trying to be clever, once said that the Irish are sentimental about causes but never about people. Keenan is a living rebuke to this. The only debts he wants to repay are to people - those who have helped him. In spite of his temper, which he says is terrific, his passion and his conviction, he seems utterly without vengeance. Anyway, he kept to his deal - built first the cottage and then set about writing the book. \"It was a debt of honour,\" he says. \"I was doing it for him and for me. To get the monkey off my back.\" It was almost impossible, he says. He couldn't find a way of inhabiting Turlough's head. \"I am no historian, I am musically illiterate, I can't play the harp. I am not blind.\" And apart from this he had never written a work of fiction. Quite simply, he didn't know how to do it. He'd start, chuck it in. Start again. He couldn't get rid of it. He was invited to give a lecture in Alaska on writing. It seemed a good place to go to get away, but even here he found himself talking about Turlough. Some time after he got home to Ireland, he received a letter from an Inuit woman who had heard him speak. He could hardly make out her name and she didn't give an address. \"I always reply to people who write to me however mad they may seem.\" She told him that Turlough is what is known in native American mythology as a dreamwalker. \"Someone who inhabits dreams, who sees in his dreams. Who has, what this woman called, blindsightedness.\" Keenan thought she was nuts. But then she wrote again, and again no address. And as she explained more about dreamwalkers in her letter, he began to see a way through to the man. What was known about Turlough was his music, his art. He is honoured and revered by many musicians through the centuries, in contemporary times particularly by the Chieftains, who have been playing Turlough's music for 30 years. Yet nothing was known \"of Turlough's head and his heart\". This is the book Keenan has written. An imaginative exploration of the man. Another kind of cradling, you could say, though this time benevolent. Keenan visits Turlough on his deathbed, comes into the room where he is dying, much as Turlough came to him in his room when he was in despair. And through Keenan's book Turlough is reborn not as a musician, not as a historical character, but as a man. \"Fleshy, honest, frail, complex.\" And if this sounds like a self-portrait, it may be that, too. There are echoes here, too, of Eliot's lines in his great poem Journey Of The Magi: \"I had seen birth and death/ But had thought they were different; this birth was/ Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.\" And ... \"I should be glad of another death.\" In allowing himself this other death, Keenan himself is reborn. He doesn't see it this way, couldn't be expected to - rejecting as he always has the identity of the man from Beirut. But it is there in the parallels between the two men: the sensory deprivation; the interior journey; Turlough's estrangement from his own background - he comes out of the peasant community and is taken up by the Irish ruling class as their itinerant minstrel - much as the west would have had Keenan play its tune. And all this, as Keenan says, at one of the most brutal times in Irish history, the late 17th century, when the Protestant ascendancy finally crushed the Catholic opposition. \"It marked the end of old Ireland, the end of the Gaelic order, when everything was taken from us, even our language was taken from us. If the term ethnic cleansing has any meaning, it was there in Ireland three centuries before it was manifest in eastern Europe.\" Much as Turlough was able to reconcile his two worlds - Ireland the physical place with all its history, \"which, though he couldn't see what was going on around him, he could sense\", and his own inner life, through music - this book becomes Keenan's reconciliation, the means finally by which he can take control again of his own destiny. You could also say that it signals Ireland's destiny - which is not English control. \"I do believe that this island should be one land.\" All of which makes it a bold book. Keenan is nervous, he says. \"It hasn't gone out to the public yet. I think that maybe the people who have read my books before will find this a strange departure.\" But then this is, of course, its point. When he was in the cell, he tried not not to think about love, and when he came out he wasn't ready to. \"Coming out of that place, where there was so little in the way of affection, I was very aware that I could just fall into something.\" So he took his time, went off to live in a house in County Mayo lent to him by a priest. \"I'd never met him, but he wrote to me offering the house.\" It was away from the media, there was no phone, no television. \"No one could find me there.\" And he started to think and eventually to put on to tape his experience of those four years.

It was soon after this that he rang Audrey, a physiotherapist he had met while he was in hospital. \"I had rather cheekily taken her number from one of the duty rosters.\" Five years ago, they married and they now have two sons, Jack, three and Colum, 10 months. \"People say Colum is a Scots name. But it's not. It's an old Irish name that was stolen by the Scots.\" He wasn't sure about fatherhood. \"I was anxious, still am. I thought, at 45, I was too old. But they are nice kids, lovely people.\" And tall, both of them are going to be over six foot. \"As a small person I always wanted to be tall.\" When he was, his mum used to say to him, \"'Be careful with what you want, you may get it.' So, she was right.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502428083,00.html\">Buy The Blue Book at BOL</a> <br></p> <p> The death earlier this week of R S Thomas has left a huge gap in Welsh literary life, yet it comes at a time when the future of Welsh poetry is looking brighter than it has for years. The most talked-about young writer is 26-year-old Owen Sheers. Andrew Motion praises his work as \"sharp, fresh, clear and ambitious\", and fellow Welsh poet Dannie Abse describes him as \"the real thing\". Sheers was awarded an Eric Gregory award last year for his poems and his debut collection, The Blue Book, has now been shortlisted for the Forward Prize best first collection. </p> <p>\"I used to buy the annual Forward anthology,\" says Sheers, \"so it is brilliant to actually be in it this year. I know this sounds a bit stupid, but with the book all I thought about was pre-publication. It didn't really sink in that people would read it and comment on it, so the response to it has been a bonus.\" </p> <p>The collection draws on a wide range of references. There are poems about the Gwent farms and schools where he was brought up, as well as love poems and memories of adolescent violence. More exotically, he writes about a return visit to Fiji, his birthplace, to find the woman who buried his umbilical cord under a coconut tree. He found the woman, but the tree had been destroyed years earlier in a hurricane.

When he was 10 he won the Abergavenny agricultural show poetry competition, and by the time he went to read English at Oxford he had amassed a sizeable body of work. However, \"the stultifying academic atmosphere there\" temporarily halted his production, and it wasn't until he was offered a place on a poetry masterclass given by Paul Muldoon at the Hay festival that he started to write again. \"I had a wonderful week being knocked into shape by Paul Muldoon. It gave me my appetite back for poetry.\" Sheers then enrolled on the poetry section of the creative writing course at the University of East Anglia, where he was tutored by Andrew Motion. </p> <p>\"When I signed on for the course I was dubious about the concept of being taught to write. But it was a huge help. Writing had always been at the periphery of what I did, so it was wonderful to put it at the centre of my life.\" He praises Motion for guiding his reading - \"he put me on to Keith Douglas, who I had never read before, and I learned a lot\" - and as a constructive critic. \"But I wasn't conscious of being tutored, and it is only after I left that I realised how much I had learnt.\" </p> <p>Motion was obviously also impressed with Sheers, and identified him in the Times as a poet to watch in the new millennium. But despite this high-profile boost, Sheers claims never to have conceived of poetry as a career. \"I don't think it would be especially helpful to be a poet full-time. I always want to do other things as well.\" </p> <p>These other things have so far not been the typical extra-curricular work of a literary poet. As well as being a keen sportsman - captain of rugby, modern pentathlete and runner, who completed the Paris marathon earlier this year - he has been a researcher on The Big Breakfast . \"I've tried to keep the poetry and TV separate, but it can still be difficult because you are working with words and scripts,\" he explains. \"I did worry that my language was being constrained and wasn't being able to develop.

      "bodyText": "Buy The Blue Book at BOL The death earlier this week of R S Thomas has left a huge gap in Welsh literary life, yet it comes at a time when the future of Welsh poetry is looking brighter than it has for years. The most talked-about young writer is 26-year-old Owen Sheers. Andrew Motion praises his work as \"sharp, fresh, clear and ambitious\", and fellow Welsh poet Dannie Abse describes him as \"the real thing\". Sheers was awarded an Eric Gregory award last year for his poems and his debut collection, The Blue Book, has now been shortlisted for the Forward Prize best first collection. \"I used to buy the annual Forward anthology,\" says Sheers, \"so it is brilliant to actually be in it this year. I know this sounds a bit stupid, but with the book all I thought about was pre-publication. It didn't really sink in that people would read it and comment on it, so the response to it has been a bonus.\" The collection draws on a wide range of references. There are poems about the Gwent farms and schools where he was brought up, as well as love poems and memories of adolescent violence. More exotically, he writes about a return visit to Fiji, his birthplace, to find the woman who buried his umbilical cord under a coconut tree. He found the woman, but the tree had been destroyed years earlier in a hurricane. As he puts it in the poem, the tree had been \"taken like a match in the wind, / that nothing was left, / just a perfect belly button of dark brown soil.\" The poems exhibit a subtle facility for observation and insight, and many of them can be read as being autobiographical. \"A friend of mine, who didn't know that I wrote, said he felt as if he had read my diary,\" says Sheers. \"Obviously that's not completely true, as it is a constructed art form and there is as much fiction as truth in it.

      "body": "<p><strong> Mo Mowlam: The Biography</strong> <br> Julia Langdon<br> 299pp, Little, Brown<br> \u00a316.99 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502379837,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> <br></p> <p> She is brave, ebullient, effective and immensely popular. A year after the general election of May 1997 that brought Tony Blair's New Labour government to power, her rating among the public stood at 86 per cent, exceeding that of any of her colleagues, the Prime Minister included. She seemed to be the politician elected governments long for. But now she has announced her intention to leave parliament, cabinet and government at the next election. Few shooting stars have climbed so rapidly and fallen so fast. Why? </p> <p>The easy answer is envy. A government whose leaders are intensely conscious of poll ratings, popularity and their own standing cannot tolerate, it is alleged, the presence among them of someone so loved. The explanation, however, is much more complex, and Julia Langdon explores it in a biography that is sympathetic and insightful, but lapses from time to time into repetitive hagiography. The litany of Mowlam's virtues - bright, funny, touchy-feely, direct, blunt, open - is repeated in quotation after quotation from former friends and lovers. The analysis of her colleagues' motives for sidelining and then dropping her is fascinating, but less fully explored. </p> <p>Mo had several counts against her. She came from a family under strain, held together by her determined mother, Tina; her charming and likeable father, Frank, drifted into alcoholism, and shamed his family with his capricious drunken rages. His second child, Mo, coped by escaping into homework. In these difficult circumstances, reminiscent of Bill Clinton's troubled boyhood, she learned how to please people - for she needed both appreciation and affection - and how to protect her own most private feelings. </p> <p>Her earliest ambitions were for academic achievement, and those ambitions took her through school (a good Coventry comprehensive) to the University of Durham, where she was an active and iconoclastic student leader in the turbulent late 1960s, and the University of Iowa, where she took her doctoral degree. It seemed that she was destined for academia. But she was not to be deflected from a political career, and she set about achieving it with determination, returning to to teach first at Newcastle University, and then at an adult education college in Barnsley. Those choices were directly related to her political aspirations. And here she encountered the first hurdle - being a woman. </p> <p>It was never easy for a woman to be selected for a winnable Labour seat; the macho culture of manufacturing industry went deep into Labour's soul. That culture was much stronger in the North than in the South. Mowlam found out during her years of local party involvement in Newcastle that women were expected to organise social events and make the tea. Much the same was true of South Yorkshire. During the miners' strike, she organised help for miners' families, but was not called upon to take a political role. She had, though, made a valuable contact in Charles Clarke, by then head of Neil Kinnock's office, and worked for him during the summer of 1983. </p> <p>Kinnock, who had no reservations about women in public life, admired her. \"Mo is one hell of a lass,\" he told his colleagues. His support encouraged her, but it was a stroke of luck that brought her a safe Labour constituency, Redcar, when its long-standing MP James Tinn decided to retire. </p> <p>In the House of Commons, Mo chose to become one of the lads: direct, blunt and at ease with what Julia Langdon delicately calls \"industrial language\". Her parliamentary pair, Michael Portillo, described her as \"a new sort of MP\". She didn't stay on the back benches long. Ten months after entering parliament, Mo was appointed junior spokeswoman on Northern Ireland. She was clearly being groomed for higher office, and after only 18 months she was moved to a key job in Gordon Brown's Treasury team as City and corporate affairs shadow minister. How well she did that job is a matter of controversy. What became clear was that she did not endear herself to Brown, nor he to her. </p> <p>And this was the second hurdle. For Mowlam was not only a woman, she was an unconventional one. The quotations in Langdon's biography are telling. One unnamed colleague said: \"She doesn't recognise the distance between other people's bodies and her own.\" It wasn't only that she trampled on the conventions - she took delight in doing so. One interview, 11 months after her election as member for Redcar, began with Mowlam declaring to the reporter, Colin Brown of the Independent , \"I've got a new bra on and it's killing me\". She insisted on telling ministerial colleagues that she asked her security police to buy tampons for her. And she made little secret of past lovers, though she made it clear she was no one's parliamentary bimbo. </p> <p>Not everyone was pleased. \"She stands too close when talking to you and uses your Christian name excessively,\" wrote Lynn Barber in the Mail on Sunday in February 1998. She ascribed it to the New Labour style. But that was wrong. It was Kinnock who liked such forthrightness, sometimes amounting to vulgarity; New Labour was altogether more uptight, seeking to establish its respectability in the eyes of the all important middle class. </p> <p>That was why it was surprising that Mo was appointed as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. She had, of course, already been the shadow spokeswoman in opposition, a job she made it clear at the time she did not want. She had established close contacts with many key people in the province - and with many ordinary citizens too. Furthermore, her directness, her warmth and her body language of hugs and embraces was in sharp contrast to the patrician distance adopted by many of her predecessors. She opened up Hillsbrough's gardens for parties, and broke down the barriers between the establishment and the republicans, to the horror of some officials in the Northern Ireland office, who briefed the media against her. </p> <p>Blair's gamble, however, worked. Without Mowlam's reaching out to the nationalist community it is doubtful whether the Good Friday agreement would ever have come about. The tragedy was that her value in bringing in the nationalists offended the unionists - and she was not at all the kind of woman the unionists warmed to. Indeed, few women have played even a minor part in the deliberations of the unionist parties. When the Women's Coalition managed to get two women elected to the Northern Ireland assembly - one Protestant, one Catholic - both were subjected to considerable abuse from fellow Assembly members. </p> <p>So she was at first indispensable, and then, some time towards the autumn of 1998, dispensable. It was clear that David Trimble was no longer prepared to work with her. Tony Blair became, in the words of Peter Mandelson, his own Northern Ireland Secretary. Mowlam was reduced to a secondary role. At a meeting with Blair and Bill Clinton, when the President asked her to sit down and join them, she responded with uncharacteristic bitterness: \"Oh, didn't you know? I'm the new tea lady round here.\" Mandelson, once a close enough friend to be a holiday companion, was now a savage critic. He characterised her as \"terminally undisciplined\": a very New Labour comment. </p> <p>No one can take away Mo Mowlam's achievement, or the impact that her warmth and her courage in the face of serious illness made on a public deeply suspicious of politicians. But she lost the good will of New Labour's quartet of leaders - or else never had it. First there was Gordon Brown, who would not have her on his team after that first shadow post; then there was Peter Mandelson; then Jack Straw, whom she had replaced in 1995 on the National Executive Committee, and who had been chosen by Blair ahead of Mowlam to manage his bid for the leadership. Blair himself was the last to abandon her, offering her the job of Secretary of State for Health in the reshuffle of June 1999. Mowlam, bent on becoming Foreign Secretary, refused. It was probably the greatest mistake of her political life. She believed Brown would have held back funds for the department if she were the minister, but the political imperatives made that unlikely. The post of Foreign Secretary was never a serious possibility. So she ended up with a portentous non-job, that of Cabinet enforcer. After Jack Cunningham's time there, it had begun to look like an ante-room to dismissal. </p> <p>Mowlam is a free spirit, and cannot easily be confined to a message or to a form of behaviour. That is one reason for her immense popularity - she has never distanced herself from ordinary people. Her style once irritated Arthur Scargill, tsar of the Yorkshire miners. Today it irritates Millbank. But it is a style that commends itself to the electors, and to her own party, a hybrid of new and old Labour. </p> <p>I met Mo earlier this year at a breakfast after the Frost programme. She indicated that I should sit beside her. With her usual frankness, she made it clear that life was pretty hellish and that she could not see what her job was about. She feared, however, that her resignation would damage the government's standing with its own supporters. It was one among the many lessons the government has learned painfully in these last few weeks.</p>",

It soon transferred to London's west end. The following summer, Nichols took his wife, Thelma, two younger daughters Louise and Catherine, and son Dan, to New York for the Broadway opening of the play, with Albert Finney in the lead as the child's father. Later that year, other productions were staged in Paris, Rome and Berlin. </strong></p> <p><strong> September 1968</strong> </p> <p>At our hotel beside the Schlosspark-Theater, a sort of annexe of the Schiller, we were met by Boleslaw Barlog, the general intendant of the whole outfit. More photos, capturing us before a poster advertising Ein Tag im Sterben von Joe Egg . The rehearsal was encouraging, though the worst errors weren't obvious at first: one, that the child is played by an adult actress; and two, we couldn't see any affection in the way the parents handled her. </p> <p>The woman doing Joe has made a great effort imitating the physical distortions of a spastic child, a spectacle so repulsive that Herr Barlog has turned her wheelchair to face upstage. All this helps to create an atmosphere not so much homely as horrific. I thought of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. The achievement of Mike's production was to show the mundane exchanges and routines that constitute life with such a daughter. </p> <p> <strong> January 1969</strong> </p> <p>Peter Medak is the sleepy young Hungarian who'll be directing the Joe Egg film. I showed him \"my\" Bristol, where the action was set, took him to tea with my mother, Grace in the script; toured the undistinguished houses that the teacher-hero could afford to buy and that should be the film location, showed him the usual tourist sights and visited Abigail in her mental hospital, Hortham. </p> <p>Our oldest daughter has declined a great deal since we last saw her nine months ago. Her legs are withering entirely with lack of use. You can almost circle them at the calf with thumb and middle finger. She cried a few times while Thelma nursed her. The other inmates sat in their invalid chairs or on seats around the walls, watching us or busy with their own repetitive gestures. One pretty child rhythmically struck the back of her head against the padded chair-back with a violence that could have been either suicidal or therapeutic. Glum-faced, the sister told us Abo wasn't so well. </p> <p>\"She's going down, I'm afraid.\" </p> <p>I can't say I was overjoyed but certainly felt some cold comfort from knowing she won't have to survive this much longer. Of course, one can't help being haunted by the thought that she feels and knows far more than she can tell. Why else cry so bitterly, sedated and anaesthetised as she is? Is her consciousness like her mother's during her birth? A point I failed to make in the film. This is my last chance to say what I have to on the subject of our poor daughter, whose misfortune has given us a certain fame and a safe future, but who can't share either. </p> <p>Peter and I walked in the grounds while Thelma sat nursing her daughter. Children in the furthest wing were penned behind wire-netting, like zebras in a zoo. </p> <p> <strong> July 17</strong> </p> <p>After breakfast, Thelma left to catch the Bristol train. Abigail nearly died last week and her ward sister asked Thelma to visit. There'd been no detectable pulse for some time and we hourly expected to hear of her death. Uncle Frank, the male nurse, was sent to see her and reported her to be pathetically wasted. We all hoped they wouldn't strive too officiously to keep her alive. </p> <p>I drove to Guy's where Michael Blakemore was joining me for his first glimpse of the operating theatres (for my new play The National Health). His labyrinthine adulteries put him out of touch for some days, while I was eager to work. </p> <p>After garbing in white, we watched a young girl undergoing an operation on her heart. On the anaesthetist's side of the protective screen, her sweet face with the unspoilt child's hair, so healthy after the pallid adult's faces; on the other side, a shambles of blood and puckered flesh. The anaesthetist gently laid his hand on her brow, which I thought a lovely and reassuring gesture, then realised he was noting the pulse in her temple. </p> <p>Poor Abo, our parcel of faulty goods, lives on, despite repeated promises. The doctor who delivered her has never spoken to us from that day to this. The Euthanasia Bill, which I supported, was defeated in the Lords and the Times rejoiced. Our next-door neighbour, Doctor Alan Norton - in his book New Dimensions in Medicine - agrees. In person, he told me it would do more harm than good to alter the vague conditions in which doctors are able to help the dying out of their misery. All right, I argued, but it's in places like Hortham that one looks for courage and mercy from the outside world. What's easier than to sweep those poor idiots under the carpet and forget them? By sustaining such lives, society is relieved of the guilt of their deaths. </p> <p><strong> November 11</strong> </p> <p>For the Bristol home of Bri and Sheila [Joe's parents] in the Egg film, Medak has chosen Freeland Place, a choice Regency location, where only TV producers can afford to live. I went to see Van Eyssen of Columbia, and said it wasn't the best time to discuss the film rights of The National Health as I was very unhappy. He at once rang and ticked them off for prettifying the film. In the morning we heard from Hortham that Abigail's worse again. She can't last much longer, they say. So shall we go down tomorrow, sit by her bed and hope she won't recover yet again? No wonder I've written two plays about sickness and my latest TV play describes a funeral. She'll soon be nine, if she makes it. </p> <p>The unanimous praise in Paris still hadn't managed to attract audiences but now we've been sent an Italian magazine with pictures of the Rome production where the action takes place in a marble palazzo with chandeliers, ornate inlaid ceiling, and old-master paintings. </p> <p>Charles [Wood, the playwright] met us at Temple Meads [a railway station] and drove us in bright sunshine to Hortham hospital, offering a flask of brandy to fortify our spirits. We stayed at our daughter's bedside from 11am to 3.30pm. She can't be moved without causing her to cry. The slightest disturbance hurts and upsets her. The bedclothes were at first pulled up to her chin but, after she'd wet herself, the nurses had to change her sheets and nightdress and there was no hiding the pitiful twisted body. </p> <p>Her ribcage juts through skin stretched like a membrane, merely a bag keeping in the organs. It's muscles that make us attractive. Her thighs are bone with a thin covering of flesh and, everywhere the bones touch the bed, she's sore. One elbow's bandaged. Her legs are doubled up and have to be disposed so as to inflict the minimum discomfort. She made a good deal of noise and cried whenever Thelma moved her too abruptly. </p> <p>In the opposite bed is a pretty girl, some years younger than Abo but obviously damaged in similar ways. Having seen our daughter's decline over the last two years, we know this child will end like her. She has a future only of pain and misery. </p> <p>Some cases are more bearable than these: the hunchback mongol pushing herself about the floor on her knees at least finds a lot to smile about; a fat bald woman in a wheelchair who likes to propel herself; and a handsome boy who's clever enough to go to \"school\", which probably means that hall I visited where they assemble the lids of bubble-blowers. </p> <p>Above these, the slightly happier, are those capable of helping nurse the others, young women obsessed with the hospital's social calendar, bossing one another, flaring into quick resentments. One of 63 was sick of the place and made repeated attempts to walk out during our visit. She could be one of those who were institutionalised, committed here before sedative drugs were common, leave alone psychiatric treatment, so now incapable of making her way in the world. </p> <p>Above the level of capable patients are the nurses themselves, brusque, jocular, doing a job few of us would consider. They content themselves with mundane grumbling about the injustices of hospital admin and their low pay. </p> <p>One of the kids was, we found, the son of a woman who had written to me about Joe Egg, telling me both her children are handicapped. One's at Hortham, one waiting for a place. So much for the lies they told us about disability never striking in the same place twice.In the wire pen, semi-caged humans performed their inexplicable movements. I wanted Harold Hobson to take the guided tour and then look at his notice again. </p> <p>(The critic Hobson had allowed his own experience to distort his view of Joe Egg. He was lame and walked with sticks, due to his parents having trusted Christian Science to cure his infantile polio. He allowed that I'd \"taken a limiting case\", as though I'd gone shopping for it, but thought I had too easily scorned The Laying-On of Hands. \"Miracles do sometimes happen,\" he wrote, then went on to exemplify his own history (presumably) where a doctor had said he'd never be able to earn his living and that child \"went on subsequently to earn about \u00a36,000 a year more than the doctor ever did. But I admit the author has chosen [my italics] an instance graver than this.\") </p> <p>The matron apologised for calling us. </p> <p>\"You never know. She seems to be dead. For days there isn't a even a pulse then suddenly she revives like this.\" </p> <p>We've decided not to visit again until we hear the good news that she's gone. This trip at least convinced Thelma we can't have her home. She can't even bear being moved a few inches but must lie there being fed and bathed and revived by drugs and brandy (yes!) until the mechanism finally overcomes their cruel and crazy efforts to keep it working. Someone give me permission and a painless sedative and I'll kill her without a qualm. </p> <p> <strong> January 14 1970</strong> </p> <p>To Bristol to observe shooting of their picturesque, TV-commercial version of Joe Egg. </p> <p>Medak, in a fur coat, smooth and benign as ever.,\"Some of this stuff is beautiful, doorlink. There is one moment when she brings the baby back from the hospital and she just wipes away a tear ... my God, it's the whole bloody play in one shot!\" </p> <p>But not the play I wrote. </p> <p>I see now what he's turning it into: Georgy Girl with tears. </p> <p>Later at dinner, Trevor Nunn was over-respectful to me and I had no idea how to deal with this as so far the only show of his I'm aware of seeing is Much Ado and didn't much care for it. Surely he couldn't have thought as much of me as he made out. Supporting Janet [Suzman, an actress, Nunn's then wife, who was up for the part in the film] I suppose. </p> <p>\"Oh, Peter,\" he said as we munched our way through the delicious venison, \"what a play! Hw I wish you'd sent it to us first - the Royal Shakespeare!\" </p> <p>\"Oh, Trevor,\" I answered, \"I did. And we didn't even get a reply.\" </p> <p> <strong> May 26</strong> </p> <p>Invited to a Wardour Street viewing-theatre to see the Egg film. I was pleasantly surprised at times, only because my expectations had been so low. Melodrama instead of light comedy. He's denied any possibility of living a decent life with a handicapped child. Of course, the play, too, failed to state that case well enough but at least it tried. I'd have done better to understate the difficulties than exaggerate them. </p> <p> <strong> December 16</strong> </p> <p>Abigail's 10th birthday. Thelma rang Hortham hospital and was told she's unchanged, except that her bedsores have healed. \"A small miracle,\" said the sister. No other miracles to report. They're having a little celebration for her. What, cake? Jelly? Musical chairs? Postman's knock? No crackers, they could start a fit. The only cause for celebration is that she won't know a thing about it. </p> <p> <strong> May 8 1971 </strong> </p> <p>Lovely day. Tennis with [Michael] Frayn at Ranger's House, then with Louise in our garden. A friend came with his son and daughter to watch the Cup Final. Then Bristol hospital was on the line. Not another crisis? It wasn't likely, I thought, as they hadn't bothered us with false alarms for some time now. </p> <p>\"Hullo?\" </p> <p>\"Are you Mister Nichols, the father of Abigail Nichols?\" </p> <p>The professional voice of death. I knew it at once. </p> <p>\"Yes.\" </p> <p>\"Well, I'm sorry to have to inform you that she passed away peacefully at half-past six this evening.\" </p> <p>About an hour ago. We'd been eating. </p> <p>\"Well, in the cirumstances that can only be seen as a good thing.\" </p> <p>We exchanged the obligatory cliches - happy release, blessing all round, end of her suffering, stopping short only at \"good innings\". </p> <p>\"She was seen by Doctor yesterday and there appeared to be nothing unusual. Her chest finally couldn't stand the strain.\" </p> <p>Thelma cried when I told her. For a while I held her in my arms. Louise had already gone to bed complaining that she was ill. I went to see her. </p> <p>\"Abigail's dead,\" she said. </p> <p>\"Yes. I'm glad too, aren't you?\" </p> <p>\"She might be happier in another life after death. If there is one.\" </p> <p>\"She could hardly be less happy, as far as we can see.\" </p> <p>\"If I'd been the first, it could have been me.\" </p> <p>She's always been the most conscious of her eldest sister's existence. </p> <p>We sat in a dazed mood, rang our parents, decided to tell the Frayns and Woods. Thelma suggested putting a notice in the Times. I asked whatever for, as no one knew her, and then only as a disaster. Even we knew only what we'd invented, a personality based on accidental gestures and reflexes. We comforted ourselves with the thought that her state had helped us understand each other and strengthened our marriage. Deepened it even. She dies obscurely, this well-known invalid who had smiled a few times, cried a great deal, never learnt to sit up. Her death had been postponed 11 years by drugs, her fits suppressed, those outward signs of her inner chaos. </p> <p> <strong> May 9</strong> </p> <p>Drove to Bourne End for Tom's (Stoppard's) party. He was pouring wine in the marquee. Entertainments laid on included Punch-and-Judy, a Shetland pony, croquet and the pool. Our girls were soon in the shallow end and the actor John Stride was the only adult to brave the water. </p> <p>Thelma suddenly said, \"Is Lou in trouble?\" I stared at our daughter's face, submerging and surfacing, and thought she'd find her feet in a moment. But Tom moved at once, lay on the side, reached out and pulled her towards him. Stride swam promptly to her aid. I arrived too late to be of any use. Louise cried as her pride took a bruising but was otherwise unhurt. </p> <p>Later, I was watching the conjuror when a sudden splash made me turn in the slow-motion mode that I'd adopted for the day and saw Thelma comforting Catherine. Stride, now fully dressed and soaked to the skin, had jumped in to save her. To lose one daughter may be a misfortune. To stand about while other men save the other two is emblematic of my trance-like incompetence. 2 </p> <p><strong> May 10</strong> </p> <p>Thelma and I joined Joe Melia at the Embassy, Swiss Cottage, to watch the Central School's production of Egg. Those lines about whether the child could outlive 'us' had a new depth and there were moments when I felt like standing and announcing, \"She's dead, ever y one. It's over.\" </p> <p><strong> May 11</strong> </p> <p>Notice in the Times' column of Births, Marriages and Deaths. </p> <p>\"Nichols, Abigail, eldest daughter of Peter and Thelma, at Hortham Hospital, Bristol. Funeral Friday, Canford Cemetery: family flowers only. Donations, if required, to the hospital.\" </p> <p> <strong> May 14</strong> </p> <p>An easy train ride to Bristol. Sat in the Co-op limousine staring out at Clifton college, the Zoo, the Downs, Badminton school and at last Canford, where the hearse was waiting. </p> <p>\"There she is, Mum,\" I said to Thelma, expecting it would be the last time we'd use this manner of speech, invented to give Abigail some character, even to make her falsely articulate. It was a child-size coffin, of course. As we reached the chapel, one of the undertakers whispered, \"Give me a nod when you've stood enough and the coffin will go down.\" </p> <p>What ceremony else? We now doubted whether we'd been right to insist on a non-religious cremation. Should I make a speech? There'd be nothing, no minister or music. </p> <p>We followed the coffin in, borne by four men. Only the box could have weighed much; she had wasted away to nothing with lack of exercise. We were in the front row and behind us our family and two of the nurses who'd cared for her. When the coffin was set in place on the lift, we decided to kneel, a position that at least suggests humility, but to what? To some far-fetched sadist who could have allowed a cruelty like this? </p> <p>I wish now I'd had the guts to stand. But at least it meant that those who were capable of praying were already on their knees. And this occasion wasn't for us but others. I held Thelma's hand very tight as she started giving convulsive sobs. Afterwards she said, \"It was the size of the box.\" When she'd spent her tears, I gave a nod and the coffin sank. </p> <p>I shook hands with the nurses and one said she was lovely and her little heart was strong but she'd at last succumbed when her lung collapsed. She'd even shown signs of knowing them, she said, and I thought \"Not bad for a 10-year-old.\" Nothing anyone said made me feel anything but relief that her long-delayed death had at last been allowed by our clumsy ethics. </p> <p>(During one of our visits to Hortham, I'd asked a nurse if it wouldn't be kinder to let her die. </p> <p>\"But she's a holy innocent,\" she replied, with a smile so sanctimonious I could have hit her. Whatever doctors may feel, their actions are circumscribed by these simple priest-ridden women.) </p> <p>As we drove back, the driver gave a covert wave to a mate of his arriving with the next coffin. </p> <p>\u00a9 2000 Peter Nichols.

      "bodyText": "A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, Peter Nichols's award-winning play about life with a handicapped child, opened at the Glasgow Citizen's Theatre in 1967, directed by Michael Blakemore. It soon transferred to London's west end. The following summer, Nichols took his wife, Thelma, two younger daughters Louise and Catherine, and son Dan, to New York for the Broadway opening of the play, with Albert Finney in the lead as the child's father. Later that year, other productions were staged in Paris, Rome and Berlin. September 1968 At our hotel beside the Schlosspark-Theater, a sort of annexe of the Schiller, we were met by Boleslaw Barlog, the general intendant of the whole outfit. More photos, capturing us before a poster advertising Ein Tag im Sterben von Joe Egg . The rehearsal was encouraging, though the worst errors weren't obvious at first: one, that the child is played by an adult actress; and two, we couldn't see any affection in the way the parents handled her. The woman doing Joe has made a great effort imitating the physical distortions of a spastic child, a spectacle so repulsive that Herr Barlog has turned her wheelchair to face upstage. All this helps to create an atmosphere not so much homely as horrific. I thought of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. The achievement of Mike's production was to show the mundane exchanges and routines that constitute life with such a daughter. January 1969 Peter Medak is the sleepy young Hungarian who'll be directing the Joe Egg film. I showed him \"my\" Bristol, where the action was set, took him to tea with my mother, Grace in the script; toured the undistinguished houses that the teacher-hero could afford to buy and that should be the film location, showed him the usual tourist sights and visited Abigail in her mental hospital, Hortham. Our oldest daughter has declined a great deal since we last saw her nine months ago. Her legs are withering entirely with lack of use. You can almost circle them at the calf with thumb and middle finger. She cried a few times while Thelma nursed her. The other inmates sat in their invalid chairs or on seats around the walls, watching us or busy with their own repetitive gestures. One pretty child rhythmically struck the back of her head against the padded chair-back with a violence that could have been either suicidal or therapeutic. Glum-faced, the sister told us Abo wasn't so well. \"She's going down, I'm afraid.\" I can't say I was overjoyed but certainly felt some cold comfort from knowing she won't have to survive this much longer. Of course, one can't help being haunted by the thought that she feels and knows far more than she can tell. Why else cry so bitterly, sedated and anaesthetised as she is? Is her consciousness like her mother's during her birth? A point I failed to make in the film. This is my last chance to say what I have to on the subject of our poor daughter, whose misfortune has given us a certain fame and a safe future, but who can't share either. Peter and I walked in the grounds while Thelma sat nursing her daughter. Children in the furthest wing were penned behind wire-netting, like zebras in a zoo. July 17 After breakfast, Thelma left to catch the Bristol train. Abigail nearly died last week and her ward sister asked Thelma to visit. There'd been no detectable pulse for some time and we hourly expected to hear of her death. Uncle Frank, the male nurse, was sent to see her and reported her to be pathetically wasted. We all hoped they wouldn't strive too officiously to keep her alive. I drove to Guy's where Michael Blakemore was joining me for his first glimpse of the operating theatres (for my new play The National Health). His labyrinthine adulteries put him out of touch for some days, while I was eager to work. After garbing in white, we watched a young girl undergoing an operation on her heart. On the anaesthetist's side of the protective screen, her sweet face with the unspoilt child's hair, so healthy after the pallid adult's faces; on the other side, a shambles of blood and puckered flesh. The anaesthetist gently laid his hand on her brow, which I thought a lovely and reassuring gesture, then realised he was noting the pulse in her temple. Poor Abo, our parcel of faulty goods, lives on, despite repeated promises. The doctor who delivered her has never spoken to us from that day to this. The Euthanasia Bill, which I supported, was defeated in the Lords and the Times rejoiced. Our next-door neighbour, Doctor Alan Norton - in his book New Dimensions in Medicine - agrees. In person, he told me it would do more harm than good to alter the vague conditions in which doctors are able to help the dying out of their misery.

November 11 For the Bristol home of Bri and Sheila [Joe's parents] in the Egg film, Medak has chosen Freeland Place, a choice Regency location, where only TV producers can afford to live. I went to see Van Eyssen of Columbia, and said it wasn't the best time to discuss the film rights of The National Health as I was very unhappy. He at once rang and ticked them off for prettifying the film. In the morning we heard from Hortham that Abigail's worse again. She can't last much longer, they say. So shall we go down tomorrow, sit by her bed and hope she won't recover yet again? No wonder I've written two plays about sickness and my latest TV play describes a funeral. She'll soon be nine, if she makes it. The unanimous praise in Paris still hadn't managed to attract audiences but now we've been sent an Italian magazine with pictures of the Rome production where the action takes place in a marble palazzo with chandeliers, ornate inlaid ceiling, and old-master paintings. Charles [Wood, the playwright] met us at Temple Meads [a railway station] and drove us in bright sunshine to Hortham hospital, offering a flask of brandy to fortify our spirits. We stayed at our daughter's bedside from 11am to 3.30pm. She can't be moved without causing her to cry. The slightest disturbance hurts and upsets her. The bedclothes were at first pulled up to her chin but, after she'd wet herself, the nurses had to change her sheets and nightdress and there was no hiding the pitiful twisted body. Her ribcage juts through skin stretched like a membrane, merely a bag keeping in the organs. It's muscles that make us attractive.

Her legs are doubled up and have to be disposed so as to inflict the minimum discomfort. She made a good deal of noise and cried whenever Thelma moved her too abruptly. In the opposite bed is a pretty girl, some years younger than Abo but obviously damaged in similar ways. Having seen our daughter's decline over the last two years, we know this child will end like her. She has a future only of pain and misery. Some cases are more bearable than these: the hunchback mongol pushing herself about the floor on her knees at least finds a lot to smile about; a fat bald woman in a wheelchair who likes to propel herself; and a handsome boy who's clever enough to go to \"school\", which probably means that hall I visited where they assemble the lids of bubble-blowers. Above these, the slightly happier, are those capable of helping nurse the others, young women obsessed with the hospital's social calendar, bossing one another, flaring into quick resentments. One of 63 was sick of the place and made repeated attempts to walk out during our visit. She could be one of those who were institutionalised, committed here before sedative drugs were common, leave alone psychiatric treatment, so now incapable of making her way in the world. Above the level of capable patients are the nurses themselves, brusque, jocular, doing a job few of us would consider. They content themselves with mundane grumbling about the injustices of hospital admin and their low pay. One of the kids was, we found, the son of a woman who had written to me about Joe Egg, telling me both her children are handicapped. One's at Hortham, one waiting for a place. So much for the lies they told us about disability never striking in the same place twice.In the wire pen, semi-caged humans performed their inexplicable movements.

Someone give me permission and a painless sedative and I'll kill her without a qualm. January 14 1970 To Bristol to observe shooting of their picturesque, TV-commercial version of Joe Egg. Medak, in a fur coat, smooth and benign as ever.,\"Some of this stuff is beautiful, doorlink. There is one moment when she brings the baby back from the hospital and she just wipes away a tear ... my God, it's the whole bloody play in one shot!\" But not the play I wrote. I see now what he's turning it into: Georgy Girl with tears. Later at dinner, Trevor Nunn was over-respectful to me and I had no idea how to deal with this as so far the only show of his I'm aware of seeing is Much Ado and didn't much care for it. Surely he couldn't have thought as much of me as he made out. Supporting Janet [Suzman, an actress, Nunn's then wife, who was up for the part in the film] I suppose. \"Oh, Peter,\" he said as we munched our way through the delicious venison, \"what a play! Hw I wish you'd sent it to us first - the Royal Shakespeare!\" \"Oh, Trevor,\" I answered, \"I did. And we didn't even get a reply.\" May 26 Invited to a Wardour Street viewing-theatre to see the Egg film. I was pleasantly surprised at times, only because my expectations had been so low. Melodrama instead of light comedy. He's denied any possibility of living a decent life with a handicapped child. Of course, the play, too, failed to state that case well enough but at least it tried.

They're having a little celebration for her. What, cake? Jelly? Musical chairs? Postman's knock? No crackers, they could start a fit. The only cause for celebration is that she won't know a thing about it. May 8 1971 Lovely day. Tennis with [Michael] Frayn at Ranger's House, then with Louise in our garden. A friend came with his son and daughter to watch the Cup Final. Then Bristol hospital was on the line. Not another crisis? It wasn't likely, I thought, as they hadn't bothered us with false alarms for some time now. \"Hullo?\" \"Are you Mister Nichols, the father of Abigail Nichols?\" The professional voice of death. I knew it at once. \"Yes.\" \"Well, I'm sorry to have to inform you that she passed away peacefully at half-past six this evening.\" About an hour ago. We'd been eating. \"Well, in the cirumstances that can only be seen as a good thing.\" We exchanged the obligatory cliches - happy release, blessing all round, end of her suffering, stopping short only at \"good innings\". \"She was seen by Doctor yesterday and there appeared to be nothing unusual. Her chest finally couldn't stand the strain.\" Thelma cried when I told her. For a while I held her in my arms. Louise had already gone to bed complaining that she was ill. I went to see her. \"Abigail's dead,\" she said. \"Yes. I'm glad too, aren't you?\" \"She might be happier in another life after death. If there is one.\" \"She could hardly be less happy, as far as we can see.\" \"If I'd been the first, it could have been me.\" She's always been the most conscious of her eldest sister's existence. We sat in a dazed mood, rang our parents, decided to tell the Frayns and Woods. Thelma suggested putting a notice in the Times. I asked whatever for, as no one knew her, and then only as a disaster. Even we knew only what we'd invented, a personality based on accidental gestures and reflexes. We comforted ourselves with the thought that her state had helped us understand each other and strengthened our marriage. Deepened it even. She dies obscurely, this well-known invalid who had smiled a few times, cried a great deal, never learnt to sit up. Her death had been postponed 11 years by drugs, her fits suppressed, those outward signs of her inner chaos. May 9 Drove to Bourne End for Tom's (Stoppard's) party. He was pouring wine in the marquee. Entertainments laid on included Punch-and-Judy, a Shetland pony, croquet and the pool. Our girls were soon in the shallow end and the actor John Stride was the only adult to brave the water. Thelma suddenly said, \"Is Lou in trouble?\" I stared at our daughter's face, submerging and surfacing, and thought she'd find her feet in a moment. But Tom moved at once, lay on the side, reached out and pulled her towards him. Stride swam promptly to her aid. I arrived too late to be of any use. Louise cried as her pride took a bruising but was otherwise unhurt. Later, I was watching the conjuror when a sudden splash made me turn in the slow-motion mode that I'd adopted for the day and saw Thelma comforting Catherine. Stride, now fully dressed and soaked to the skin, had jumped in to save her. To lose one daughter may be a misfortune. To stand about while other men save the other two is emblematic of my trance-like incompetence. 2 May 10 Thelma and I joined Joe Melia at the Embassy, Swiss Cottage, to watch the Central School's production of Egg. Those lines about whether the child could outlive 'us' had a new depth and there were moments when I felt like standing and announcing, \"She's dead, ever y one. It's over.\" May 11 Notice in the Times' column of Births, Marriages and Deaths. \"Nichols, Abigail, eldest daughter of Peter and Thelma, at Hortham Hospital, Bristol. Funeral Friday, Canford Cemetery: family flowers only. Donations, if required, to the hospital.\" May 14 An easy train ride to Bristol. Sat in the Co-op limousine staring out at Clifton college, the Zoo, the Downs, Badminton school and at last Canford, where the hearse was waiting. \"There she is, Mum,\" I said to Thelma, expecting it would be the last time we'd use this manner of speech, invented to give Abigail some character, even to make her falsely articulate. It was a child-size coffin, of course. As we reached the chapel, one of the undertakers whispered, \"Give me a nod when you've stood enough and the coffin will go down.\" What ceremony else? We now doubted whether we'd been right to insist on a non-religious cremation. Should I make a speech? There'd be nothing, no minister or music. We followed the coffin in, borne by four men. Only the box could have weighed much; she had wasted away to nothing with lack of exercise. We were in the front row and behind us our family and two of the nurses who'd cared for her. When the coffin was set in place on the lift, we decided to kneel, a position that at least suggests humility, but to what? To some far-fetched sadist who could have allowed a cruelty like this? I wish now I'd had the guts to stand. But at least it meant that those who were capable of praying were already on their knees. And this occasion wasn't for us but others. I held Thelma's hand very tight as she started giving convulsive sobs. Afterwards she said, \"It was the size of the box.\" When she'd spent her tears, I gave a nod and the coffin sank. I shook hands with the nurses and one said she was lovely and her little heart was strong but she'd at last succumbed when her lung collapsed. She'd even shown signs of knowing them, she said, and I thought \"Not bad for a 10-year-old.\" Nothing anyone said made me feel anything but relief that her long-delayed death had at last been allowed by our clumsy ethics. (During one of our visits to Hortham, I'd asked a nurse if it wouldn't be kinder to let her die. \"But she's a holy innocent,\" she replied, with a smile so sanctimonious I could have hit her. Whatever doctors may feel, their actions are circumscribed by these simple priest-ridden women.) As we drove back, the driver gave a covert wave to a mate of his arriving with the next coffin. \u00a9 2000 Peter Nichols.

We certainly have no grounds for smugness about it in this country. The radical right's nihilistic violence and intolerance make life a misery for ethnic minorities and others exposed to a climate of fear on a daily basis. </p> <p>In Germany, the problem is particularly pronounced in the eastern provinces which, until 1990, formed part of the German Democratic Republic and still suffer from relative economic deprivation. Though serious incidents of neo-Nazi terror have frequently taken place in cities such as Rostock, on the Baltic coast, conditions for foreigners - especially from eastern Europe or non-European countries - are in some ways even worse outside the big cities where, as was the case with Jews in Nazi Germany, they represent particularly exposed targets. </p> <p>The neo-Nazi organisations have no coherent ideology to speak of. Like the Nazis of the 1920s, their worldview is made up of a crude amalgam of phobias and resentments fixed, inevitably, on the vicious search for scapegoats. Unlike the original Nazis, however, they have no possibility of latching on to important strands of an existing political culture. </p> <p>In the 20s, the aim of building an ethnically pure \"national community\" which would eradicate social divisions and bring power and prosperity was beguiling for more than just hardline Nazi supporters. And it was a vision which Hitler offered to a country wracked by the deepest of fissures, running through state and society, underpinned by a profound sense of national humiliation after the loss of the first world war and the imposition of the Treaty of Versailles. </p> <p>This fertile ground is simply not present today. Neo-Nazi imagery is backward-looking, finding an ideological lowest common denominator in a glorified but completely distorted image of Hitler and the Third Reich. They need a hero - someone who represented a macho-Germany, the power, might and national grandeur which is lacking in their often dismal, unappealing and powerless everyday reality of the present. </p> <p>It is evidently asking too much of latter-day Hitler admirers to see that the \"good times\" of the 1930s led inexorably to the disasters of the 1940s, and that their hero bears the chief personal responsibility for the catastrophe. But most Germans today recognise this plainly. </p> <p>However appalling the actions of the neo-Nazis are, short of the onset of a mega-political and social crisis such as only a war - or perhaps a total collapse of the world-economic system - could bring, they pose no threat to the existing state systems, in Germany or elsewhere. Without such preconditions, they will remain an intense social pest, but one confined to the lunatic fringes of society and politics, not a threat to their substance. </p> <p>In the 20s, the fragile democracy of the Weimar Republic was increasingly devoid of support, both from the masses and from the powerful elites in business, agriculture, the civil service and - not least - the army, biding their time until they could bring back an authoritarian system of rule. </p> <p>As the Depression paralysed the economy in the early 1930s, democracy was as good as friendless. In contrast to Britain, where there were certainly economic, and for a time governmental, difficulties, Germany suffered from a total, comprehensive crisis of the state system itself. Where the structures of the British parliamentary system held firm, depriving Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists of the \"political space\" in which they might have gained support, in Germany the terminal collapse of pluralist, democratic structures left the door gaping wide open for Hitler's takeover of power. </p> <p>Today, Germany is a modern, well-functioning, consolidated parliamentary democracy enjoying overwhelming backing from the vast majority of the population. The pockets of neo-Nazi support would, in the event of elections tomorrow, almost certainly fail to be converted into a single seat in the Bundestag. Far from being tormented by economic crisis, today's Germany is among the wealthiest countries in the world. </p> <p>Its problems are for the most part those shared with other modern capitalist economies. The incorporation of the former GDR has been, and still is a specific problem - there is still a good way to go before the economic and social disparities with the wealthier western parts of the country are ironed out. And the pyschological scars from the perceived disadvantaging of the east will no doubt take still longer to heal. But unless there is unforeseen calamity, Germany's economic prosperity ought to see the problems diminish greatly over the next generation. The residual illusory hopes invested in a new F\u00fchrer will probably then evaporate, as they did following a short-lived upsurge of the radical right in the 60s - apart, doubtless, from an unreconstructed 2-4% of the population (as in other countries). </p> <p>Meanwhile, intensified controls on neo-Nazi activity, more education aimed at heading off recruitment, and, not least, more channelled funding to give disillusioned and sometimes despairing youth in the eastern regions hope for the future and a greater stake in today's democracy, ought to help. </p> <p>There is one further barrier to the radical right. The European Union, for all its faults, provides a level of political co-operation which, coupled with the imperatives of a global economy, offers a strong bulwark against the type of political and economic storm- waves of the 20s and early 30s. </p> <p>Imagine the neo-Nazi problem in a Germany decoupled from the EU (and especially, from its pivotal relationship with France), in a Europe with serious national and economic tensions and conflicts, and reflect whether European integration has been a positive or negative development. </p> <p>Of course, the EU has itself been a source of the resentment that has flowed into the new nationalisms, not least with J\u00f6rg Haider in Austria. Politicians recognise, behind the rhetoric around immigration, objective problems of freedom of population in the post-cold-war Europe have to be tackled. And Haider and his like have succeeded in influencing the agenda of conservative parties. </p> <p>But democratic structures have not been threatened. And were they to be so, then more rigorous and concerted international action than the ill-conceived boycott against Austria would provide serious obstacles to any individual country within the EU wanting to go its own way.

      "body": "<p>Other people's homes always look so enviably cosy and confident, particularly at dusk, just before curtains are drawn and shutters closed - when the rooms facing the street are lit up to show passers-by tantalising glimpses of another life that is infinitely more easy and stylish than their own. </p> <p>This belief in the superiority of other people's style - and insecurity about our own - is why many of us flick through interiors magazines, employ interior decorators or have an as yet unfulfilled desire to knock on the door of nice houses in leafy streets and ask if we can swap lives with them, please. </p> <p>How many of us secretly lack confidence in our own individual taste? When we are really forced to show our hand, such as moving into a new home, it can send some of us into a state of near stylistic breakdown. As Edith Wharton, the American novelist who also wrote about interior and garden design, said: \"It seems easier to most people to arrange a room like someone else's than to analyse and express their own needs\". </p> <p>Which is where a new self-help book comes in. Personal Space, by Kate Worsley, takes the reader through a series of hugely enjoyable exercises in which the reader is stylistically \"diagnosed\" through a combination of multiple choice and questionnaires about taste. Working through a choice of photos and text, the reader moves from choosing their dream house and favourite landscape to preferred colour range, texture and mood. </p> <p>Once the reader has been diagnosed into either a \"type\" - are you \"Pure\", \"Easy\", \"Maverick\", \"Urban\", \"Sensuous\" or \"Wild\", or a combination of two or more of them? - the book then moves on to helpful chapters that illustrate rooms according to your specified \"space character\". All of which aims to help the reader achieve an understanding of their \"own sensibilities\". The result, the book claims, is that you arrive at \"a home that projects your individuality to the world - your very own personal space\". Who could not be intrigued? </p> <p>I am too far gone and my \"taste\" is dictated by inherited furniture that I can do little about. But I have a friend, let's call her \"J\", who suffers from a full-blown decorative personality disorder. She is mostly mock Indian, very bright colours, Elle Decoration circa 1998, with borderline National Trust-Georgian tendencies, interspersed by phases of cosy-bungalow-in-Southampton, just like her elderly parents. </p> <p>In fact, she has not just bought her home - where she lives with her rather patient, bumbling husband, in a sought-after area of London - but you would be forgiven for thinking so. There are oblongs of colour all over the walls of the house, where J has tried to commit to a colour once and for all by painting a sample from a trial tub. Different kinds of fabric are draped over everything, in an attempt to help her make a firm decision about upholstery. And, having ripped out the carpet to expose the floorboards, she has changed her mind and flung dozens of rugs in opposing styles and patterns. She is a fashion designer, too, so she and everyone else around her thinks that she ought to know what she is doing when it comes to doing up her home. </p> <p>J could not deny that she needed therapy and so, with a free evening ahead, we started our multiple choice, which, we hoped, would reveal something about ourselves and our influences and attitude towards homemaking. </p> <p>It was even more enjoyable than those women's magazine questionnaires J and I used to do when we were teenagers - \"Is your man the love of your life or just a time-waster?\" - which, after you had answered some difficult questions such as \"Ring up your man and ask him the colour of your eyes\", would usually advise you to \"dump him\". </p> <p>We had to work our way through 14 exercises, ranging from our attitudes to \"Indulgence And Denial\" and \"Order And Chaos\", to the kind of \"Mood\", \"Texture\", \"Pattern\" and \"Ornament\" we preferred. For \"Home\", we had to pick our dream dwelling from a choice of photos - Ranch House, Chateau, Penthouse, Cottage, Tropical Beach Hut or Tower? - and then write down up to three key words that went with our choice. I was the Ranch, no question, and J was, oddly enough, the extraordinarily architectural glass Tower. </p> <p>We surprised ourselves by how quickly and confidently we moved through each of the exercises, and how we raced through the subsequent \"statement choices\". (How right they were, I mused, that in my chaotic household, \"The laundry basket is usually full\", and, \"Often I cannot find where I put my bills\".) </p> <p>A couple of hours and a bottle of wine later, we fed all this data into the book's personal space \"spectrum diagnoser\", which distilled the exercise results, the statement choices and \"key words\" that related to our lives - was I \"ramshackle\" or \"serene\"? - to arrive at a stylistic type. I was a down-the-line \"Maverick\", my bedlinen is \"a riot\", my key words including \"haphazard\" and \"ramshackle\".

      "bodyText": "Other people's homes always look so enviably cosy and confident, particularly at dusk, just before curtains are drawn and shutters closed - when the rooms facing the street are lit up to show passers-by tantalising glimpses of another life that is infinitely more easy and stylish than their own. This belief in the superiority of other people's style - and insecurity about our own - is why many of us flick through interiors magazines, employ interior decorators or have an as yet unfulfilled desire to knock on the door of nice houses in leafy streets and ask if we can swap lives with them, please. How many of us secretly lack confidence in our own individual taste? When we are really forced to show our hand, such as moving into a new home, it can send some of us into a state of near stylistic breakdown. As Edith Wharton, the American novelist who also wrote about interior and garden design, said: \"It seems easier to most people to arrange a room like someone else's than to analyse and express their own needs\". Which is where a new self-help book comes in. Personal Space, by Kate Worsley, takes the reader through a series of hugely enjoyable exercises in which the reader is stylistically \"diagnosed\" through a combination of multiple choice and questionnaires about taste. Working through a choice of photos and text, the reader moves from choosing their dream house and favourite landscape to preferred colour range, texture and mood. Once the reader has been diagnosed into either a \"type\" - are you \"Pure\", \"Easy\", \"Maverick\", \"Urban\", \"Sensuous\" or \"Wild\", or a combination of two or more of them? - the book then moves on to helpful chapters that illustrate rooms according to your specified \"space character\". All of which aims to help the reader achieve an understanding of their \"own sensibilities\". The result, the book claims, is that you arrive at \"a home that projects your individuality to the world - your very own personal space\". Who could not be intrigued? I am too far gone and my \"taste\" is dictated by inherited furniture that I can do little about. But I have a friend, let's call her \"J\", who suffers from a full-blown decorative personality disorder. She is mostly mock Indian, very bright colours, Elle Decoration circa 1998, with borderline National Trust-Georgian tendencies, interspersed by phases of cosy-bungalow-in-Southampton, just like her elderly parents. In fact, she has not just bought her home - where she lives with her rather patient, bumbling husband, in a sought-after area of London - but you would be forgiven for thinking so. There are oblongs of colour all over the walls of the house, where J has tried to commit to a colour once and for all by painting a sample from a trial tub. Different kinds of fabric are draped over everything, in an attempt to help her make a firm decision about upholstery. And, having ripped out the carpet to expose the floorboards, she has changed her mind and flung dozens of rugs in opposing styles and patterns. She is a fashion designer, too, so she and everyone else around her thinks that she ought to know what she is doing when it comes to doing up her home. J could not deny that she needed therapy and so, with a free evening ahead, we started our multiple choice, which, we hoped, would reveal something about ourselves and our influences and attitude towards homemaking. It was even more enjoyable than those women's magazine questionnaires J and I used to do when we were teenagers - \"Is your man the love of your life or just a time-waster?\" - which, after you had answered some difficult questions such as \"Ring up your man and ask him the colour of your eyes\", would usually advise you to \"dump him\". We had to work our way through 14 exercises, ranging from our attitudes to \"Indulgence And Denial\" and \"Order And Chaos\", to the kind of \"Mood\", \"Texture\", \"Pattern\" and \"Ornament\" we preferred. For \"Home\", we had to pick our dream dwelling from a choice of photos - Ranch House, Chateau, Penthouse, Cottage, Tropical Beach Hut or Tower? - and then write down up to three key words that went with our choice. I was the Ranch, no question, and J was, oddly enough, the extraordinarily architectural glass Tower. We surprised ourselves by how quickly and confidently we moved through each of the exercises, and how we raced through the subsequent \"statement choices\". (How right they were, I mused, that in my chaotic household, \"The laundry basket is usually full\", and, \"Often I cannot find where I put my bills\".) A couple of hours and a bottle of wine later, we fed all this data into the book's personal space \"spectrum diagnoser\", which distilled the exercise results, the statement choices and \"key words\" that related to our lives - was I \"ramshackle\" or \"serene\"? - to arrive at a stylistic type. I was a down-the-line \"Maverick\", my bedlinen is \"a riot\", my key words including \"haphazard\" and \"ramshackle\". (In fact, although the author warns that most people will be a mix of a couple of choices, all mine were in the same category, so I suppose that means my house can stay a jumbled mess.) J, however, was a more interesting mixture of \"Easy\" - with her order/chaos statements such as, \"My bed is where a lot of living is going on\" - and \"Pure\", with her picture choice of Tower as a dream Home, Foreshore as a Place and Zen as a Mood.

      "body": "<p>\u0095 Was Booker Prize chair Simon Jenkins's appearance at Jeanette Winterson's launch - held at Gordon Brown's wedding party venue, the Jerwood Space Gallery - a foretaste of the eagerly awaited shortlist, revealed next week? Those looking for clues in a noticeably leak-free year might wonder, but the connection was (probably) innocuous, both authors having appeared The Word festival. One participant not present was Michael Heseltine, whose tete-\u00e0-tete with his Henley successor, Boris Johnson, was cancelled due to lack of interest. The only explanation the Loafer can come up with for this ignominious no-show is that Heseltine, as a new member of the literati, had opted for one of the evening's other parties - hosted by Maeve Binchy and Barbara Windsor. </p> <p> \u0095 The extravagantly bearded Joseph Connolly, a charming addition to any gathering, is in hot water over the convergence of fiction and reality in his latest novel, It Can't Go On. It's one thing to create a drunken, boorish character, quite another to make him the employee of a real-life institution. The thoroughly upright Manchester Building Society has taken issue with its appearance in a trendy metropolitan novel - it doesn't even have a London office, for heaven's sake! - and is currently considering having recourse to the law. The last time the Loafer encountered Mr Connolly he was in fine fettle, having returned home from an evening's sport at 7am, showing no sign of fatigue - from which one might infer that this little difficulty is unlikely to strike the fear of God into him. </p> <p> \u0095 An early entry for the most entertainingly fatuous jacket puff of the year. The Islington Gazette on historical novelist Elizabeth Hawksley's previous work: \"Like Jane Austen, only faster.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Inspired by evidence of back-biting among cooks, the poetry world is muscling in on the act with a series of dinners at London's Poetry Caf\u00e9. Each scribbler takes on a world cuisine, with Michael Donaghy going Mexican, Sarah Maguire opting for Lebanese, and so forth. Donaghy, as even his friends will testify, has trouble with a slice of toast, so the results might be interesting. Far less ambitiously, the Poet Laureate has decided to kick off next week's National Poetry Day with a \"Power Breakfast\" - there being far less scope for disaster with cornflakes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Was Booker Prize chair Simon Jenkins's appearance at Jeanette Winterson's launch - held at Gordon Brown's wedding party venue, the Jerwood Space Gallery - a foretaste of the eagerly awaited shortlist, revealed next week? Those looking for clues in a noticeably leak-free year might wonder, but the connection was (probably) innocuous, both authors having appeared The Word festival. One participant not present was Michael Heseltine, whose tete-\u00e0-tete with his Henley successor, Boris Johnson, was cancelled due to lack of interest. The only explanation the Loafer can come up with for this ignominious no-show is that Heseltine, as a new member of the literati, had opted for one of the evening's other parties - hosted by Maeve Binchy and Barbara Windsor. \u0095 The extravagantly bearded Joseph Connolly, a charming addition to any gathering, is in hot water over the convergence of fiction and reality in his latest novel, It Can't Go On. It's one thing to create a drunken, boorish character, quite another to make him the employee of a real-life institution. The thoroughly upright Manchester Building Society has taken issue with its appearance in a trendy metropolitan novel - it doesn't even have a London office, for heaven's sake! - and is currently considering having recourse to the law. The last time the Loafer encountered Mr Connolly he was in fine fettle, having returned home from an evening's sport at 7am, showing no sign of fatigue - from which one might infer that this little difficulty is unlikely to strike the fear of God into him. \u0095 An early entry for the most entertainingly fatuous jacket puff of the year. The Islington Gazette on historical novelist Elizabeth Hawksley's previous work: \"Like Jane Austen, only faster.\" \u0095 Inspired by evidence of back-biting among cooks, the poetry world is muscling in on the act with a series of dinners at London's Poetry Caf\u00e9. Each scribbler takes on a world cuisine, with Michael Donaghy going Mexican, Sarah Maguire opting for Lebanese, and so forth. Donaghy, as even his friends will testify, has trouble with a slice of toast, so the results might be interesting. Far less ambitiously, the Poet Laureate has decided to kick off next week's National Poetry Day with a \"Power Breakfast\" - there being far less scope for disaster with cornflakes.",

People of the 18th century knew they were enlightened. \"There is a mighty light which spreads itself over the world, especially in those two free Nations of England and Holland,\" wrote the Earl of Shaftesbury early in the century. He wasn't talking about a comet, but \"the establishment of an intire philosophicall Liberty\". Gibbon called England \"his free and enlightened country\", and Tom Paine, who designed smokeless candles as well as a revolutionary state of mind, said: \"What we have to do is as clear as light.\" </p> <p>Such a statement wasn't just metaphor. France may have had a Sun King, but Newton's Opticks represented a scientific discovery of light. \"God said, let Newton be!\" wrote Pope, \"and all was light.\" Enlightenment was also literal truth: the urban English were brighter than other people. \"In Oxford-street alone there are more lamps than in all of Paris,\" wrote an astonished Prussian. And the British went on improving their vision: though he was created by an Irishman, Lemuel Gulliver, Porter points out, was English literature's first bespectacled hero. </p> <p>But these instances are just sparks struck off the anvil of Porter's argument, that there was indeed a British Enlightenment (there was never any argument about the lumi\u00e8res or illuminati across the Channel). After the bloodshed, religious bigotry, witch-burning and political upheavals of the 17th century, something had changed. </p> <p>\"In France we cringe to the great, in England the great cringe to the people,\" said a pithy Frenchwoman. The meritocracy had arrived, and with it a kind of limited democracy that Porter calls \"inclusiveness\". Some of this was more metropolitan than national, and one agency of this inclusiveness was the coffee house, where wits and thinkers used debating societies, gazettes and journals to brew not just business or commerce but a culture of openness. </p> <p>\"We are become a Nation of Statesmen,\" said the Craftsman magazine. \"Our Coffee-Houses and Taverns are full of them.\" It must indeed have been something to repair to the Turk's Head in Gerrard Street, Soho, and hear Samuel Johnson presiding over gatherings that included Oliver Goldsmith, Joshua Reynolds, David Garrick, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Edward Gibbon and Adam Smith. And there were other agencies of change more powerful still: the pleasure gardens, the museums (the British Museum was founded by an act of parliament in 1753) and the theatre (Gay's Beggar's Opera was seen by more than 40,000 people in its first season in 1728). Then there were the rigours of science after Newton, and the appeals to reason of the philosophers Locke and Hume. </p> <p>The 18th century of Addison, Steele, Defoe and Swift was also hack heaven. Between 1660 and 1800, more than 300,000 books and pamphlets were printed and sold - perhaps 200 million copies. Modern print culture was invented then: one entrepreneur (whose Finsbury Square headquarters boasted the sign \"Cheapest Booksellers In the World\") turned over 100,000 volumes a year by inventing the art of remaindering. </p> <p>The newspapers took coffee-house wit to county towns. The Salisbury Journal sold 4,000 copies, more than most Paris newspapers. Print had become the dynamo of change. This was the world of Grub Street and Henry Fielding's hack Blotpage; of the novel and that new breed \"author by trade\"; of publishing deals, partworks and paperbacks, children's books, how-to-do-it books and circulating libraries. What circulated above all were ideas. \"It is with great pleasure I observe,\" said David Hume, \"that men of the world are proud of borrowing from books their most agreeable topics of conversation.\" </p> <p>Among these ideas were tolerance, generosity and that favourite word of the era, reason. Locke talked of \"the reasonableness of Christianity\"; Newton had established a physical universe capable of being understood by reason. Could God's laws be different? And if religion was rational, and basic truths plain, what justification could there be for compulsion? Tolerance prepared men to look in all directions. Captain Cook - surely the perfect exemplar of his century's mental mobility and decency, for he joined the Royal Navy at 28 as an able seaman and rose to become the greatest navigator of all - began the first serious study of Polynesian language and culture, and started to dismantle both romantic and dismissive attitudes to \"savagery\". In 1772, the law turned against slavery in Britain, and attitudes in Britain turned against slavery itself. Mary Astell in 1700 asked the other great question: \"If all Men are born free, how is it that all Women are born slaves?\" </p> <p>This was the century that interpreted the planet as a kind of self-sustaining, cyclic, terrestrial system, that began the process of systematic mastery of wilderness and saw the economy of nature as there to finance the march of mankind. \"Three fourths of the habitable globe are now uncultivated,\" complained William Godwin, but already the begetters of the agricultural revolution had begun the process of making two blades of grass grow where one grew before. And this was a century of an insular self-satisfaction that echoes our own: \"With what joy and gratitude must every Englishman reflect on the happiness of his own nation in comparison of any other,\" said a traveller back from Lisbon in 1775. </p> <p>This headlong, heady book takes hold as Henry V took Harfleur - by storm, and with some great phrases. Porter doesn't so much argue as hammer home his brilliantly selected evidence. The marvellous anti-Enlightenment figures of Blake and Coleridge are also among the makers of modern Britain, but somehow Porter accommodates them. Occasionally, you wonder rebelliously whether someone so much the master of his material could not just as deftly have produced an entirely different thesis, with different, equally dazzling quotations. Every now and then he makes modern parallels - the daily post with email, Restoration theatre with television, Christian economists with Thatcherism -that jar a little. Yet the only real complaint is that this book feels about 500 pages too short. </p> <p>The era ended in reaction: evangelical, political, romantic, conformist. \"Oh God, teach him to think like other people,\" said Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, child of the Enlightenment, of her son by Percy Shelley. She sent him to Harrow. \"He rose without trace to become a member of Parliament and, reassuringly, a conformist nonentity,\" says Porter. The great adventure, not so much in thought as in thinking, came to a close with \"a mad monarch, with enlightened men like Hazlitt mourning the triumph of unreason, and with Swift's ghost cackling in the background\".</p>",

What emerges from this exhaustive biography is that, unlike Kirk and most stars, Burt didn't have to pretend. He was a genuine article - he did his own stunts, his name was his own, his screen height was his real height. Running his own production company, at a time when few actors did, meant he controlled his career, which cut out a lot of Hollywood sucking-up. Perhaps he suffered fewer insecurities as a result, but the abundance of confidence in its turn bred an unpredictable monster. </p> <p>While he thought of himself as somewhat bookish and worrisome, everyone else remarked on his blazing temper. Directors were frequently fired and Harold Hecht, his business partner, was believed to have hired a gag-writer to provide replies to Lancaster's putdowns (Lancaster, after getting new dental caps, described Hecht as having his old teeth). After one spectacular row, Lancaster wandered casually into Hecht's office with a Utrillo under his arm as a making-up present. One observer noted that Lancaster was canny enough to surround himself with people less pleasant than himself, and another said that, if pushed, \"he could come street on you real quick\". </p> <p>The temper came from his mother - of whom, Lancaster said, he lived in mortal fear. Born in 1913 of Irish stock, he was raised decent but poor in east Harlem. Unusually, he held on to the values instilled by his upbringing after becoming famous, and remained liberal and politically active. His demeanour was more statesmanlike than Ronald Reagan's; he was also a man of extraordinary physical grace, a fact which is as evident in the small gestures of the late film Conversation Piece as it is in the broad swashbuckling pictures. </p> <p>Balance, poise, and a head for heights - the higher you go the easier it gets, he liked to say - were developed in his early years as an acrobat travelling across Depression-era America. Later on, when he took his male circus partner to Hollywood, there was gossip about his sexual leanings, with further rumours of attendance at homosexual parties. Buford nags at this issue only to conclude, for lack of hard evidence, that Lancaster was in some way pan-sexual. A more prosaic interpretation would be that he remained loyal to friends when it was unfashionable to do so, didn't mind what company he was seen in and was too smart to let anyone pin him down. Few, apart from his last wife, talk as though they knew him. Serial reinvention is a Hollywood staple, but Lancaster must have had several characters on the go at once - how else to account for so many contradictory versions? One telling detail is that he always travelled light. Visconti described him as the most perfectly mysterious man he had ever met. </p> <p>Visconti was one of the few directors to get the better of him. Robert Siodmak, who directed his first film, The Killers, in 1946, found little gratitude once Lancaster was a star. On The Crimson Pirate he was appalled by the transformation. Lancaster was a victim of his own megalomania and quite unmanageable, he said, as well as being overbearing and foul-mouthed - so much so that the English crew wrote an open letter of complaint (which, given the capacity of the average film crew for fluent swearing, is quite something). But the system had its revenge: once Lancaster had peaked as a star and his production company had overreached itself - ironically with the flop The Sweet Smell of Success, now considered one of his lasting achievements - he had to work for reduced fees to pay off his earlier profligacy as a producer. Yet with hindsight his work shows a discipline and an appetite for risk that makes the output of an equivalent star such as Warren Beatty look flabby and listless. </p> <p>In spite of his vitality, Lancaster was never a natural actor. The effort of keeping his temper could make his measured politeness appear psychopathic, and he was drawn to playing repressed men. He collaborated well with directors such as Robert Aldrich and John Frankenheimer, but shied away from working with obviously great ones, perhaps fearing that his limitations would be exposed - though he benefited from Visconti's refinement and fussiness on The Leopard , which gave him his greatest sense of worth as an actor. A point Buford misses is his similarity to another Visconti prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Dirk Bogarde, who also needed to prove that he was more than a lightweight. Both men worried about the fraudulent nature of their business, struggled between profanity and culture, and were granted a late flourish. </p> <p>Buford's reading of the films relies too much on second-hand opinion, but in the long run her cumulative efforts prove a match for her elusive subject. Rarely for a film actor - and even more rarely for a star - Lancaster is revealed as more complex than the sum of his parts; the result is the most interesting book on an actor since The Man Who Kept the Secrets, the biography of Peter Lawford. Lancaster was everything that Lawford was not: his own man, and a real star who avoided clich\u00e9, except in the extra-marital department, where he was predictably active despite promoting himself as a man of family values. For all the monstrosity, Buford makes a case for her subject as a man of dignity who, although coarsened and corrupted by the Hollywood process, achieved by effort and hard work some kind of redemption.</p>",

An explosion in the number of television channels and newspaper sections has coincided, paradoxically, with a period in which nothing much seems to be happening in the western world, at least in terms of politics and culture: no cold war, no grand ideological conflict, no great artists. </p> <p>But business is business. The acres of newsprint and the thousands of news bulletins must all be filled with something. Celebrities must somehow be created to be fed into this ravening maw, if only to be spat out in disgust a few months later. What else was the point of Channel 4's Big Brother, except to provide a fresh supply of warm bodies to be dissected in the media? </p> <p>Andrew Rawnsley's new book about the Labour government is the political equivalent of Big Brother. It takes us behind the shiny black door of the Big Brother House at No 10 Downing Street to show us a dozen or so people, apparently completely cut off from the outside world, falling out and making up, bitching and back-stabbing. Indeed, Servants of the People may well stand as the first example of a new kind of post-modernist contemporary history: a book which is itself part of the process it describes. Gossip permeates it; gossip surrounds it. Reading it becomes a physical as well as a mental exercise. It's like one of those detective novels of the 1930s sold with an accompanying box of clues. You have to flip back and forth between the main text and the notes, trying to establish for yourself the various layers of meaning, for what is important here is not just who has said what anonymously about whom, but who has passed it on to Rawnsley and why. </p> <p>It works like this. Someone says something controversial to the author off the record. Rawnsley prints it, flags it with a number, and then sources it in his notes to \"private information\". For example, on page one, we are told that in a phone call on election day, Tony Blair encouraged Paddy Ashdown to believe he \"would be foreign secretary\" in a Lib-Lab coalition. The footnote tells us this is \"private information\". The following day, Ashdown is described watching television. Suddenly he sees Robin Cook appear on the screen captioned as foreign secretary. \"Ashdown asked himself whether he minded. He decided he was relieved.\" Hmm. We thumb to the back of the book to find, once again, the familiar, nose-tapping footnote: \"private information\". By this point, of course (to use a typical Rawnsley formulation), even a \"one-eyed inner Mongolian\" can work out that the source must be Ashdown himself. So when, a couple of pages later, in a private conversation, Blair reportedly tells Ashdown what he thinks of Charles Kennedy - \"all that talent: why is he so idle?\" - we can't help but conclude that this \"private information\", too, has come from Ashdown, who is using Blair (and by extension Rawnsley) to have a little dig at his successor. </p> <p>After a while, these footnotes, like those in Martin Amis's Experience, become almost as diverting as the main text. When we are told how Ed Balls, Yvette Cooper and their baby were lying in bed one Sunday watching Blair on Breakfast With Frost, and how Gordon Brown rang to complain about the PM's performance, the curious reader immediately wonders: who is the source? Presumably not - not even in New Labour - the baby. And presumably not Brown either, unless he takes a particularly lubricious interest in his supporters' domestic arrangements. Which leaves Ed and Yvette. </p> <p>The smart money must be on Ed, if only because there are so many other pieces of damaging \"private information\" strewn about the book that have emanated from the Treasury. Maybe it was Ed, for instance, who described how he, Brown and Charlie Whelan were listening to Blair's party conference speech on a car radio when Brown suddenly started heckling (\"He didn't want that ... He opposed that ...\") And surely it could only have been Whelan, still spinning even in his political grave, who described the Chancellor's fury after being \"ambushed\" about the Ecclestone donation on the Today programme, for who else but our Charlie would say \"Gordon went mental\"? </p> <p>And so it goes on. To paraphrase Nye Bevan: why would Tony Blair need a crystal ball to discover who is briefing against whom in his government when he can read it in the book? It's all here. Even his two closest aides, Anji Hunter and Alastair Campbell, for reasons best known to themselves, have clearly decided to give a minute-by-minute account of the chaos behind the scenes at Number 10 when Peter Mandelson was forced to resign. \"Why the fuck are you landing this on me now?\" Blair is reported to have complained to Campbell, when the news of the Robinson loan was brought to him in the middle of the Kosovan crisis. \"Because it can't fucking wait,\" was Campbell's contemptuous retort. It's hard to imagine Blair himself repeating this to Rawnsley, so presumably the \"private information\" was provided by Campbell - which is strange, given that Campbell's job is to make his boss look prime-ministerial and commanding, rather than panicky and bullied by his subordinates. </p> <p>So why are they thrusting themselves forward like this? One can only assume it is because all these backroom people - Ed, Charlie, Alastair, Anji and the rest - secretly want to become celebrities in their turn, for in the Age of Gossip how else does one define one's existence except by the spread in Hello! or inclusion in the Observer 's list of \"Britain's 100 most influential people\"?

In his first speech to a Tory conference in four years, the former prime minister will say that Mr Hague's harsh language in recent months has appealed to core supporters but failed to appeal to voters on the centre ground who decide elections. Mr Major has underlined his growing frustration with Mr Hague's lurch to the right by saying in private that he could not join today's Conservative party if he were a young man. Mr Major told a dinner of the Conservative Group for Europe in June that the party of Mr Hague was different to the party of Ted Heath, who was leader when he joined. It is understood that Mr Major, who first made his mark as an anti-racist Tory councillor in Lambeth in the late 1960s, has been dismayed by Mr Hague's harsh language over asylum seekers. Friends say he has also been disappointed by Mr Hague's exploitation of the Northern Ireland peace process, which he launched as prime minister and regards as one of his finest achievements. The intervention by Mr Major in Bournemouth on Monday, the first day of the Tory conference, will come as a severe embarrassment to Mr Hague, who is attempting to present a united front in the run-up to the general election. Mr Major will win a rapturous reception from the party's left when he addresses the \"wet\" Conservative mainstream group, set up by the former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine to oppose Mr Hague's swing to the right. In his speech, Mr Major will focus on Mr Hague's decision to abandon the language of inclusivity, which characterised the first year of his leadership. One wet Tory source said: \"John Major will say that one-nation Conservatism is an important strand of Conservatism without which you cannot form a government. \"He will welcome the Tory rise in the polls but will say that that will only move beyond 40% - where you can think of forming a government - if the leadership moves to the centre ground.\"",

      "body": "<p>The truth about the Conservatives' leader is to emerge on the eve of their party conference. William Hague is not the hardline populist of his family. His father, Nigel, admits to being far worse.</p> <p>In a revealing portrait on Channel 4 tomorrow night, the Tory leader emerges as startlingly self-confident - devoted to Yorkshire and his wife, Ffion, in that order. A stickler for punctuality, he believes he can win the coming election, and he does not blame the media for his image problems - \"It's like living with the weather.\"</p> <p>Stella, his famously sensible mother, is seen in the kitchen saying: \"I think William's much more tolerant than his father.\" She describes Nigel Hague, the soft drink entrepreneur whose deliverymen set his son on the road to that 14-pint binge, as non-political and sports mad.</p> <p>Nigel chips in to explain: \"I'm a hang and plug 'em brigade ... \" before Stella cuts him off with: \"We don't want that on television.\"</p> <p>His mother also explains the family thought that William, the youngest by six years, would grow out of his politics craze after his precocious 1977 speech to the Tory conference, or \"swing the other way\" when he went to Oxford.</p> <p>The Tory leader's three older sisters also appear in Charlotte Metcalf's film, Just William ... and Ffion. Veronica, the one who dubbed William \"Tory Pig\" when he became a teenage political anorak in the 1970s, is seen describing a meeting of fellow rightwingers as a \"yawner\". She also says she will go to see her brother at the conference because \"I think this might be the last chance. How can I put this politely?\"</p> <p>Her sister-in-law, Ffion, is loyally supportive of her spouse but clearly not keen on the camera's intrusion. She does not say much. Asked if it was it love at first sight, she replies: \"You can't ask things like that.\"</p> <p>Unexpectedly, the friends Mr Hague volunteered for inspection by the TV crew turn out to be David Risby, the farmer with whom he went to school (who sold his Hague wedding photos to the Mail) and Doreen Whitehead, a cheerful matron and proprietor of the Mother Goose B&amp;B at Swaledale, the Hagues' favourite beauty spot.</p> <p>Hague aides in London appear frequently, but the shadow cabinet is conspicuous by its absence; apparently its filmed sessions were too boring. As a consequence the film is long on Yorkshire and laughter (he makes good jokes), but short on political philosophy.</p> <p>Charlotte Metcalf is a self-confessed Labour supporter who once made a party broadcast for Tony Blair, but Mr Hague will be pleased with her film. How viewers react may depend on their politics or on their attitude to alcohol. More drink is cheerfully consumed in the Hague circle than any leader has thought wise to show on camera since Churchill smoked and drank his way to victory in 1945.</p> <p>Sister Veronica has the best joke. Discussing cars around the family table (William seems ignorant), she waspishly asks: \"What's the difference between a Range Rover and a porcupine? The porcupine has the pricks on the outside.\"</p> <p>There goes the Range Rover vote.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The truth about the Conservatives' leader is to emerge on the eve of their party conference. William Hague is not the hardline populist of his family. His father, Nigel, admits to being far worse. In a revealing portrait on Channel 4 tomorrow night, the Tory leader emerges as startlingly self-confident - devoted to Yorkshire and his wife, Ffion, in that order. A stickler for punctuality, he believes he can win the coming election, and he does not blame the media for his image problems - \"It's like living with the weather.\" Stella, his famously sensible mother, is seen in the kitchen saying: \"I think William's much more tolerant than his father.\" She describes Nigel Hague, the soft drink entrepreneur whose deliverymen set his son on the road to that 14-pint binge, as non-political and sports mad. Nigel chips in to explain: \"I'm a hang and plug 'em brigade ... \" before Stella cuts him off with: \"We don't want that on television.\" His mother also explains the family thought that William, the youngest by six years, would grow out of his politics craze after his precocious 1977 speech to the Tory conference, or \"swing the other way\" when he went to Oxford. The Tory leader's three older sisters also appear in Charlotte Metcalf's film, Just William ... and Ffion. Veronica, the one who dubbed William \"Tory Pig\" when he became a teenage political anorak in the 1970s, is seen describing a meeting of fellow rightwingers as a \"yawner\". She also says she will go to see her brother at the conference because \"I think this might be the last chance. How can I put this politely?\" Her sister-in-law, Ffion, is loyally supportive of her spouse but clearly not keen on the camera's intrusion. She does not say much. Asked if it was it love at first sight, she replies: \"You can't ask things like that.\" Unexpectedly, the friends Mr Hague volunteered for inspection by the TV crew turn out to be David Risby, the farmer with whom he went to school (who sold his Hague wedding photos to the Mail) and Doreen Whitehead, a cheerful matron and proprietor of the Mother Goose B&amp;B at Swaledale, the Hagues' favourite beauty spot. Hague aides in London appear frequently, but the shadow cabinet is conspicuous by its absence; apparently its filmed sessions were too boring. As a consequence the film is long on Yorkshire and laughter (he makes good jokes), but short on political philosophy. Charlotte Metcalf is a self-confessed Labour supporter who once made a party broadcast for Tony Blair, but Mr Hague will be pleased with her film. How viewers react may depend on their politics or on their attitude to alcohol. More drink is cheerfully consumed in the Hague circle than any leader has thought wise to show on camera since Churchill smoked and drank his way to victory in 1945. Sister Veronica has the best joke. Discussing cars around the family table (William seems ignorant), she waspishly asks: \"What's the difference between a Range Rover and a porcupine? The porcupine has the pricks on the outside.\" There goes the Range Rover vote.",

Chris Ford, who was part of the research team, said: \"It has been known for many years that women who smoke whilst trying to get pregnant decrease their chances of conceiving. \"The results of our study provide more compelling reasons for couples trying to start a family to give up smoking themselves and avoid places where smoking is allowed.\"",

With the Olympic flame due to be put out at tomorrow's closing ceremony, British sports officials in Sydney are desperate to ensure that the momentum generated by the success of the team is not lost in post-Olympic euphoria. By last night Great Britain had won 23 medals, including eight golds - the most golds since the 1924 Paris games. National lottery funding has been identified as one of the main reasons for this success. Yvonne McGregor, who won a bronze in cycling, said if it had not been for lottery funding she would not have been in the sport.

That was in 1960, the first ever televised contest, in which he faced a little-known senator from Massachusetts. No one has ever made the same mistake again.</p> <p>John F Kennedy came to the debate looking tanned and healthy, having prepared for the event on the rooftop of his hotel. Vice-president Nixon had shrugged off advice to spend a few hours under a sun lamp and his naturally pallid complexion highlighted what seemed like a perpetual five o'clock shadow.</p> <p>As he arrived at the Chicago studio, Mr Nixon knocked an already infected knee against the car door. The pain drained the blood from his face and he began to sweat profusely but he waved away offers of make-up. When the debate went live across the nation, the visual contrast was startling. A vigorous and handsome challenger against a nervous and sweating office-holder. It arguably swung the closest US election of the 20th century.</p> <p>Forty years on, almost to the day, the nation is facing another presidential race which is too close to call. The campaigns are focusing on little more than 1m floating voters in a handful of swing states, where many people say they are waiting for this year's three debates between the vice-president, Al Gore, and governor George W Bush to make up their minds.</p> <p><b> Defining moment</b><br></p> <p>There is, of course, nothing in the US constitution stipulating presidential debates, but it has become the defining moment of the campaign, when the two (or occasionally three) contenders face each other in direct combat.</p> <p>After his disaster in 1960, Mr Nixon refused to debate with anyone again, and the next televised head-to-head was not until 1976. Since then they have become unavoidable, as Mr Bush discovered when his attempt to renegotiate the debates, shifting the encounters to chat shows, made him look nervous and evasive.</p> <p>Ted Sorensen, a key Kennedy aide who later helped to coach Jimmy Carter and Mike Dukakis for their presidential debates, believes they have become an essential part of the democratic process.</p> <p>\"You can memorise arguments, but it is understanding issues which is necessary to avoid stumbles. And it can't be bad having the next president be forced to understand all the issues,\" Mr Sorensen said in an interview this week.</p> <p>The importance of debates is reflected in the enormous lengths the opposing camps go to in grooming their candidates for the event. Preparations start months in advance. This weekend, in the run-up to the first debate in Boston on Tuesday, both candidates will leave the campaign trail for dress rehearsals as meticulously prepared as anything on Broadway.</p> <p>Each nominee has publicly played down the extent of his preparations, but their studied insouciance is all part of the ritual manoeuvring. Governor Bush has been practising since May.</p> <p>This weekend he will hold a mock debate at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, where the family gym has been converted into a television studio, complete with lecterns, lights, cameras and a mock Al Gore, who will be played by a New Hampshire senator, Judd Gregg. It is a role he has perfected since performing as the slightly stiff and earnest vice-president in 1996, when he was advising the Republican nominee for the job, Jack Kemp.</p> <p>However, Mr Bush's preparations look slapdash compared to the lengths the vice-president is going to.

      "bodyText": "Richard Nixon was the last candidate not to take a presidential debate seriously. That was in 1960, the first ever televised contest, in which he faced a little-known senator from Massachusetts. No one has ever made the same mistake again. John F Kennedy came to the debate looking tanned and healthy, having prepared for the event on the rooftop of his hotel. Vice-president Nixon had shrugged off advice to spend a few hours under a sun lamp and his naturally pallid complexion highlighted what seemed like a perpetual five o'clock shadow. As he arrived at the Chicago studio, Mr Nixon knocked an already infected knee against the car door. The pain drained the blood from his face and he began to sweat profusely but he waved away offers of make-up. When the debate went live across the nation, the visual contrast was startling. A vigorous and handsome challenger against a nervous and sweating office-holder. It arguably swung the closest US election of the 20th century. Forty years on, almost to the day, the nation is facing another presidential race which is too close to call. The campaigns are focusing on little more than 1m floating voters in a handful of swing states, where many people say they are waiting for this year's three debates between the vice-president, Al Gore, and governor George W Bush to make up their minds. Defining moment There is, of course, nothing in the US constitution stipulating presidential debates, but it has become the defining moment of the campaign, when the two (or occasionally three) contenders face each other in direct combat. After his disaster in 1960, Mr Nixon refused to debate with anyone again, and the next televised head-to-head was not until 1976. Since then they have become unavoidable, as Mr Bush discovered when his attempt to renegotiate the debates, shifting the encounters to chat shows, made him look nervous and evasive. Ted Sorensen, a key Kennedy aide who later helped to coach Jimmy Carter and Mike Dukakis for their presidential debates, believes they have become an essential part of the democratic process. \"You can memorise arguments, but it is understanding issues which is necessary to avoid stumbles. And it can't be bad having the next president be forced to understand all the issues,\" Mr Sorensen said in an interview this week. The importance of debates is reflected in the enormous lengths the opposing camps go to in grooming their candidates for the event. Preparations start months in advance. This weekend, in the run-up to the first debate in Boston on Tuesday, both candidates will leave the campaign trail for dress rehearsals as meticulously prepared as anything on Broadway. Each nominee has publicly played down the extent of his preparations, but their studied insouciance is all part of the ritual manoeuvring. Governor Bush has been practising since May. This weekend he will hold a mock debate at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, where the family gym has been converted into a television studio, complete with lecterns, lights, cameras and a mock Al Gore, who will be played by a New Hampshire senator, Judd Gregg. It is a role he has perfected since performing as the slightly stiff and earnest vice-president in 1996, when he was advising the Republican nominee for the job, Jack Kemp. However, Mr Bush's preparations look slapdash compared to the lengths the vice-president is going to. Mr Gore is the supreme master of detail. He likes to ensure that the practice room is set at the precise temperature expected in the television studio, even allowing for the warming effect of the bodies of the audience. In his dress rehearsal, his opponent was to have been played by Tom Downey, a friend and former congressman who had been taking professional acting classes for the role. He had reportedly perfected Mr Bush's mannerisms and even his malapropisms. But this month Mr Downey received a package in the post containing a video of Mr Bush rehearsing for the debate together with a batch of briefing notes. An FBI investigation has been launched. Meanwhile, the Gore campaign, anxious not to be seen taking advantage of the leaks, disqualified a disappointed Mr Downey from the rehearsal. His place has been taken by Paul Begala, a former Clinton aide who shares Mr Bush's Texas accent and has just written a book about Bush's record as governor. Mr Gore has gone even further. When he retreats this weekend to his debate boot camp in a Florida marine laboratory, he will take with him not just the usual entourage of advisers, technicians and supporters, but also 13 specially selected \"regular folks\" from a cross-section of the population in swing states. They include a 76-year-old pensioner, a 14-year-old schoolgirl (chaperoned by her mother) an Hispanic construction worker and a black headmaster.

Enough to fill this city of Detroit.\" Dole's credibility suffered from the suggestion that the two world wars had been political. 1980 Reagan vs Carter Ronald Reagan: \"There you go again.\" This became Reagan's catchphrase and it blunted Carter's fact-laden attacks. 1984 Reagan vs Mondale Ronald Reagan: \"I will not make age an issue in this campaign.

      "body": "<p>From the prosperous high streets to the dreary council estates and comfortable suburbs edging into the garden of England two words are repeated endlessly: trust and confidence. They are losing both in Tony Blair.</p> <p>Pensioners, low-paid workers, housewives, businesspeople - Labour loyalists, wavering Tories, floating voters - have heard his commitment to listen, to \"get the message\". They know his speech in Brighton was labelled inspiring, electrifying, his best ever; that delegates left the conference with a spring in their step.</p> <p>Yet in Kent, a corner of marginal middle-Britain, evenly split between Tory and Labour MPs, the people who helped to put Mr Blair into Downing Street appear restless, embittered and often isolated. For the moment, no mainstream party, least of all the Tories under William Hague, appears attractive.</p> <p>The mood in England's most populous county - true blue until 1997 - should set a few alarm bells ringing in New Labour's electoral machine - particularly after a council byelection where voters registered their protest by staying at home and letting the Tories in.</p> <p>For young and old the gulf between government and the people, between platform rhetoric and political reality, is wide. \"I voted for Tony Blair, and was very enthusiastic about a new government,\" says Natalie, a young catering entrepreneur in Gillingham (Labour majority 1,980). \"Now he's wrecked my confidence and the trust people had in him has gone.\"</p> <p>Outside her cafe, Philip Turnbull, 78, shakes his head wearily while walking his dog. \"I am Labour, but no more, after what he did to us,\" he says.</p> <p><b> Discontent</b><br></p> <p>Ministers should take note. Few seem impressed by a platform commitment from the chancellor and prime minister to respond to the pensioners' revolt with more cash. \"I shall not vote Labour again,\" says Mr Turnbull, who fought in the second world war. \"A lot of pensioners are thinking the same. He promised a lot, but this 75p [this year's pension increase] will barely buy a loaf of bread. I can't afford to visit my grandchildren in the south-west because petrol is so expensive.\"</p> <p>Running for a bus Frances Ebery, another pensioner, underlines the discontent of old Labour loyalists. \"He has disappointed his own people by doing what he did and he will have to fight a lot harder to win them back.\"</p> <p>A few miles away in Maidstone, drinkers in a large pub are watching the closing scenes of the Labour conference on television. Roy, 68, is not impressed. A lifelong Labour voter, he says he has been forced back to work as a part-time lorry driver to make ends meet. \"It's terrible when you've got to do that at my age. We are worse off now than ever.\" He recounts the tale of a friend with a heart complaint who had difficulty getting treatment in the local hospital because of a bed shortage. \"They kept him in for three days and he had to go home. Terrible, isn't it?\"</p> <p>Two weeks ago Ivor Jones, a former mayor of Dartford and a Labour town and district councillor since 1955, was fighting his party's corner extremely hard in a county council byelection at Swanscombe and Stone. No one can recall the seat being anything other than Labour. Yet the Tories won on a 15% turnout, leaving Mr Jones, a retired headmaster, badly bruised and \"terribly, terribly sad\". \"It couldn't have happened at a worse time,\" he says. \"Everyone was whingeing about everything. People are beginning to distrust all politicians.\"</p> <p>So have things improved for Labour over the past week? \"I wish I could say that they have,\" says Mr Jones. \"I have a great admiration for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. They are very sincere but we have to get our act together nationally.\" On the back of the fuel crisis a whole string of grievances have come to the surface, from pensioner poverty to the millions wasted on the Millennium Dome.</p> <p>Bob Peters, a former lorry driver who now runs a secondhand bookshop in Rochester High Street, strikes a popular chord when he says: \"People are beginning to see through Tony Blair's toothy smile. They have lost trust in him.\" One of his customers is the Labour MP for Medway, Bob Marshall-Andrews (majority 5,354), one of the government's more outspoken backbench critics. Stephen Hubbard, the MP's researcher and a local councillor, highlights the political dilemma facing Mr Blair. On the one hand, the local economy is much stronger than when Labour came to power. On the other, there is a perception that politicians - local and national - \"no longer address people's problems\".</p> <p>In 1997 Labour gained eight seats in Kent, leaving the Tories with nine MPs. \"We were going to have to fight hard to retain these seats and now we'll have to fight even harder,\" says Mr Hubbard.</p> <p>Part of Labour's problem is that some people thought they were voting for big boosts in education and health in 1997. In reality, they had to wait until this year for anything to be announced and will have to wait considerably longer before seeing much difference in the services offered. This leads to the constant cry that \"things haven't changed since the Tories\".</p> <p><b> Expectations</b><br></p> <p>Paul Clark, the Gillingham MP who overturned a 16,700 Tory majority on a 16% swing, is quick to stress that the government is already delivering a better health service and much improved schooling. \"People had a preconceived idea about what we would be like,\" he says. \"Their expectations were high and they were waiting for us to turn things around very quickly. You have to balance that with what was realistically possible.\"</p> <p>In the museum shop she runs in Rochester, Tara Keating says she has lost faith in almost everyone. As a lone parent and a Tory voter, she is grateful for help from Labour's new deal and the working families tax credit scheme. \"I was more than half way round to backing Tony Blair.\" Then the fuel crisis came. \"They behaved arrogantly in the extreme and I've gone off them.\" Will she vote Tory instead? \"No, Hague is personality zero - he puts off Tory voters.\" Ms Keating says she is now considering voting Green because there is nowhere else to go.</p>",

      "bodyText": "From the prosperous high streets to the dreary council estates and comfortable suburbs edging into the garden of England two words are repeated endlessly: trust and confidence. They are losing both in Tony Blair. Pensioners, low-paid workers, housewives, businesspeople - Labour loyalists, wavering Tories, floating voters - have heard his commitment to listen, to \"get the message\". They know his speech in Brighton was labelled inspiring, electrifying, his best ever; that delegates left the conference with a spring in their step. Yet in Kent, a corner of marginal middle-Britain, evenly split between Tory and Labour MPs, the people who helped to put Mr Blair into Downing Street appear restless, embittered and often isolated. For the moment, no mainstream party, least of all the Tories under William Hague, appears attractive. The mood in England's most populous county - true blue until 1997 - should set a few alarm bells ringing in New Labour's electoral machine - particularly after a council byelection where voters registered their protest by staying at home and letting the Tories in. For young and old the gulf between government and the people, between platform rhetoric and political reality, is wide. \"I voted for Tony Blair, and was very enthusiastic about a new government,\" says Natalie, a young catering entrepreneur in Gillingham (Labour majority 1,980). \"Now he's wrecked my confidence and the trust people had in him has gone.\" Outside her cafe, Philip Turnbull, 78, shakes his head wearily while walking his dog. \"I am Labour, but no more, after what he did to us,\" he says. Discontent Ministers should take note. Few seem impressed by a platform commitment from the chancellor and prime minister to respond to the pensioners' revolt with more cash. \"I shall not vote Labour again,\" says Mr Turnbull, who fought in the second world war. \"A lot of pensioners are thinking the same. He promised a lot, but this 75p [this year's pension increase] will barely buy a loaf of bread. I can't afford to visit my grandchildren in the south-west because petrol is so expensive.\" Running for a bus Frances Ebery, another pensioner, underlines the discontent of old Labour loyalists. \"He has disappointed his own people by doing what he did and he will have to fight a lot harder to win them back.\" A few miles away in Maidstone, drinkers in a large pub are watching the closing scenes of the Labour conference on television. Roy, 68, is not impressed. A lifelong Labour voter, he says he has been forced back to work as a part-time lorry driver to make ends meet. \"It's terrible when you've got to do that at my age. We are worse off now than ever.\" He recounts the tale of a friend with a heart complaint who had difficulty getting treatment in the local hospital because of a bed shortage. \"They kept him in for three days and he had to go home. Terrible, isn't it?\" Two weeks ago Ivor Jones, a former mayor of Dartford and a Labour town and district councillor since 1955, was fighting his party's corner extremely hard in a county council byelection at Swanscombe and Stone. No one can recall the seat being anything other than Labour. Yet the Tories won on a 15% turnout, leaving Mr Jones, a retired headmaster, badly bruised and \"terribly, terribly sad\". \"It couldn't have happened at a worse time,\" he says. \"Everyone was whingeing about everything. People are beginning to distrust all politicians.\" So have things improved for Labour over the past week? \"I wish I could say that they have,\" says Mr Jones. \"I have a great admiration for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. They are very sincere but we have to get our act together nationally.\" On the back of the fuel crisis a whole string of grievances have come to the surface, from pensioner poverty to the millions wasted on the Millennium Dome. Bob Peters, a former lorry driver who now runs a secondhand bookshop in Rochester High Street, strikes a popular chord when he says: \"People are beginning to see through Tony Blair's toothy smile. They have lost trust in him.\" One of his customers is the Labour MP for Medway, Bob Marshall-Andrews (majority 5,354), one of the government's more outspoken backbench critics. Stephen Hubbard, the MP's researcher and a local councillor, highlights the political dilemma facing Mr Blair. On the one hand, the local economy is much stronger than when Labour came to power. On the other, there is a perception that politicians - local and national - \"no longer address people's problems\". In 1997 Labour gained eight seats in Kent, leaving the Tories with nine MPs. \"We were going to have to fight hard to retain these seats and now we'll have to fight even harder,\" says Mr Hubbard. Part of Labour's problem is that some people thought they were voting for big boosts in education and health in 1997. In reality, they had to wait until this year for anything to be announced and will have to wait considerably longer before seeing much difference in the services offered. This leads to the constant cry that \"things haven't changed since the Tories\". Expectations Paul Clark, the Gillingham MP who overturned a 16,700 Tory majority on a 16% swing, is quick to stress that the government is already delivering a better health service and much improved schooling. \"People had a preconceived idea about what we would be like,\" he says. \"Their expectations were high and they were waiting for us to turn things around very quickly. You have to balance that with what was realistically possible.\" In the museum shop she runs in Rochester, Tara Keating says she has lost faith in almost everyone. As a lone parent and a Tory voter, she is grateful for help from Labour's new deal and the working families tax credit scheme. \"I was more than half way round to backing Tony Blair.\" Then the fuel crisis came. \"They behaved arrogantly in the extreme and I've gone off them.\" Will she vote Tory instead? \"No, Hague is personality zero - he puts off Tory voters.\" Ms Keating says she is now considering voting Green because there is nowhere else to go.",

Rod Ireland, northern European HR development manager for Intel says: \"We all compete so hard for people that making it easier to recruit from a wider marketplace will be of real benefit.\"</p> <p>Clare Starmer, resourcing executive at Xerox , agrees: \"Generally, we've avoided permit workers because procedures are too time-consuming. This new approach is a bonus.\"</p> <p>So desperate are IT companies for experts in the latest programming skills that certain firms have captalised on the opportunity.</p> <p>RedBrigade, a subsidiary of US firm iGate Capital Partners, is an IT services-provider to top consultancies such as Cap Gemini. It recruits top-flight software engineers from all over the world, particularly eastern Europe and India.</p> <p>RedBrigade recruits the engineers on to its own payroll and contracts them out to clients. After gaining 600 permits in four years, it is an old hand at the permit system. \"It's not that complex if you follow the rules,\" assures chief executive Guil Hastings. \"The trick is good communication and a certain amount of patience.\"</p> <p>Mr Hastings perceives a sea change in the industry's attitude to overseas workers. \"Two years ago, some companies were resistant. They questioned their English and had concerns about their ability because they couldn't meet them first. You encountered racism as well as valid concerns. However, desperation is a great motivator. Now no company looks askance; they're conscious of the depth of Indian talent.\"</p> <p>As to why India has such a wealth of expertise, Mr Hast ings explains: \"In the 80s, the US put an embargo on India which prevented them from using mainframes. That forced them to work with PCs. Ten years later PCs and client servers have taken over. Basically, India's 10 years ahead of the game.\"</p> <p>Not every industry is so enthusiastic about migration. Anne Bailey, head of education and training at the Engineering Employers Federation says: \"If an overseas student has studied here, people would be happy to have them. But to take people from other countries, we'd have to be sure that they understand our standards. When our workers go abroad we send them on courses to show them what it's like working abroad. Is anyone planning that kind of orientation for people coming here?\"</p> <p>In the health sector, the picture is confusing. On one hand, Tory health spokesman Dr Liam Fox accuses overseas doctors of poor English; on the other, the government says they are the answer to shortfalls.</p> <p>Aside from Dr Fox's assertions, there are other, more altruistic, concerns. A spokesperson for the British Medical Association (BMA) says: \"We'd rather our doc tors were homegrown because you couldn't rely on the overseas sources not drying up; also it's unethical to poach them from developing countries where they are badly needed.\"</p> <p>However, Dr Surendra Kumar, national chairman of the overseas doctors association, points out: \"The fact is the NHS needs more doctors now and has to recruit from overseas. We must ensure they get good training and a choice of specialisms so they return home with something to offer. The NHS can't simply use them to fill gaps.\"</p> <p>He also points out that 20% of UK doctors currently come from non-EU countries. \"Their contribution is rarely recognised and Dr Fox's comments are extremely insulting.\"</p> <p>But why can't the NHS draw on the pool of qualified doctors already here and desperate to work?</p> <p>It is estimated that there are around 2,000 refugee doctors in the UK yet the Refugee Council believes that 80% of them will never practise again.</p> <p>Obstacles include the expense of the medical and language exams to be eligible for work here and registration with the General Medical Council. Totalling nearly \u00a31,000, it's a prohibitive sum for a refugee; yet it costs the NHS \u00a3200,000 to train a doctor. Wouldn't it make economic sense for the government to give training grants to refugee doctors?</p> <p>After heavy lobbying, the issue is being recognised. A parliamentary advisory group has been set up while the BMA is looking into mentoring schemes and information networks.</p> <p>Finally, if doctors of all races and backgrounds are to compete on a level playing field, racism must be tackled. In an experiment reported in the British Medical Journal, half the applications were in Asian names, half in western-sounding names. The Asian names had significantly less chance of being shortlisted. \"The evidence tells us that racism prevents many overseas doctors from climbing the ranks,\" says Dr Kumar. \"Until that's dealt with, it's not a fair system.\"</p> <p><b>The doctor who's not wanted</b></p> <p>Zhargona Tanin, 44, was medical director and consultant gynaecologist at Malaly University Hospital, Kabul, Afghanistan. Currently she is doing some translation work.</p> <p>\"I fled from Afghanistan with my family in the early 90s just before the Mujahadeen came to power. My husband, a prominent journalist, and I were both associated with human rights activities; we knew if we didn't escape we would be in danger and, as a woman, I would lose my civil rights. We arrived in France with the clothes we wore and $800; fortunately we had French visas and gained asylum relatively easily.</p> <p>\"In France, working as a doctor was easy. After a language course and a voluntary hospital attachment, I was offered a part-time position running an obstetrics and gynaecology and family planning outpatients clinic.</p> <p>\"In 1995, my husband was offered a position in the UK and we moved. For a year I worked on a voluntary attachment at a London hospital. Since then I've applied for more than 300 positions both in gynaecology and for the GPVTS (General Practitioners Vocational Training Scheme) and I've had just one interview.</p> <p>\"First I applied for Senior House Officer positions but apparently I'm overqualified. But for more senior positions I must pass the MRCOG exams (Membership of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecology). I've passed Part 1 but now I'm told I can't sit Part 2 unless I have two to four years of work experience, so it's Catch 22. Without an interview, or even any feedback, I can't display my experience. In Kabul, I worked as a GP and a gynaecologist. I saw patients daily; I performed hundreds of operations; I lectured students; I published research papers. Here that counts for nothing. Judging an experienced refugee doctor purely on their application seems discriminatory.</p> <p>\"I miss my work desperately. Being a housewife is a kind of death. There's a terrible irony here; I left a country where women weren't going to be allowed to work to go to somewhere where they were free. But I can't work here either. And every day I hear this country desperately needs experienced doctors.\"</p> <p>It must be said that Dr Tanin's specialism faces particular problems. A BMA spokesperson says: \"We need more gynaecology consultants but the planners didn't create enough posts, so it's competitive.\"</p> <p>However, her failure to gain consideration in junior positions is probably due to a combination of racism and ageism. Dr Sheila Cheeroth, co-ordinator of the refugee doctors project says: \"Rather than think, 'great, somebody with fantastic experience' they'll dismiss her expertise because it's not British. Basically, they'd rather have a UK-trained doctor at the standard age of mid-20s.\"</p> <p>One senior gynaecologist who didn't want to be named commented: \"For a refugee doctor, various factors, including racism, are going to bend the system one way. What they need are senior-level mentors who can bend it in the other.\"</p> <p><b>The software engineer who is wanted</b></p> <p>Niranjan Joshi, 33, took a degree in Mechanical Engineering at Bombay University. With specialist knowledge of wireless technology, he is now working for RedBrigade as a team-builder. He lives in Bracknell, Berkshire, with his wife and three-year-old son.</p> <p>\"I left Bombay in April 1999 to go and work for a US-based company as a software manager. That first time was hard. The culture shock was huge; America seemed so casual compared to India, but there was no sense of community. Also there are practical things. We were given an unfurnished house; and I had to buy a car because the streets aren't safe. These things are a challenge in a strange country.</p> <p>\"Coming here was much easier. It's a good idea to wait until you're settled before bringing over the whole family so I came over alone. Then the firm found me a furnished house in Bracknell; it's a nice, neighbourly community where we feel at home. My son has settled well in the local nursery school. Making friends has been easier, too. I've been here for six months, and I'm on a year's permit. If the company wants me to stay I'd love to.\"</p>",

Finally, if doctors of all races and backgrounds are to compete on a level playing field, racism must be tackled. In an experiment reported in the British Medical Journal, half the applications were in Asian names, half in western-sounding names. The Asian names had significantly less chance of being shortlisted. \"The evidence tells us that racism prevents many overseas doctors from climbing the ranks,\" says Dr Kumar. \"Until that's dealt with, it's not a fair system.\" The doctor who's not wanted Zhargona Tanin, 44, was medical director and consultant gynaecologist at Malaly University Hospital, Kabul, Afghanistan. Currently she is doing some translation work. \"I fled from Afghanistan with my family in the early 90s just before the Mujahadeen came to power. My husband, a prominent journalist, and I were both associated with human rights activities; we knew if we didn't escape we would be in danger and, as a woman, I would lose my civil rights. We arrived in France with the clothes we wore and $800; fortunately we had French visas and gained asylum relatively easily. \"In France, working as a doctor was easy. After a language course and a voluntary hospital attachment, I was offered a part-time position running an obstetrics and gynaecology and family planning outpatients clinic. \"In 1995, my husband was offered a position in the UK and we moved. For a year I worked on a voluntary attachment at a London hospital. Since then I've applied for more than 300 positions both in gynaecology and for the GPVTS (General Practitioners Vocational Training Scheme) and I've had just one interview. \"First I applied for Senior House Officer positions but apparently I'm overqualified. But for more senior positions I must pass the MRCOG exams (Membership of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecology). I've passed Part 1 but now I'm told I can't sit Part 2 unless I have two to four years of work experience, so it's Catch 22. Without an interview, or even any feedback, I can't display my experience. In Kabul, I worked as a GP and a gynaecologist. I saw patients daily; I performed hundreds of operations; I lectured students; I published research papers. Here that counts for nothing. Judging an experienced refugee doctor purely on their application seems discriminatory. \"I miss my work desperately. Being a housewife is a kind of death. There's a terrible irony here; I left a country where women weren't going to be allowed to work to go to somewhere where they were free. But I can't work here either. And every day I hear this country desperately needs experienced doctors.\" It must be said that Dr Tanin's specialism faces particular problems. A BMA spokesperson says: \"We need more gynaecology consultants but the planners didn't create enough posts, so it's competitive.\" However, her failure to gain consideration in junior positions is probably due to a combination of racism and ageism. Dr Sheila Cheeroth, co-ordinator of the refugee doctors project says: \"Rather than think, 'great, somebody with fantastic experience' they'll dismiss her expertise because it's not British. Basically, they'd rather have a UK-trained doctor at the standard age of mid-20s.\" One senior gynaecologist who didn't want to be named commented: \"For a refugee doctor, various factors, including racism, are going to bend the system one way. What they need are senior-level mentors who can bend it in the other.\" The software engineer who is wanted Niranjan Joshi, 33, took a degree in Mechanical Engineering at Bombay University. With specialist knowledge of wireless technology, he is now working for RedBrigade as a team-builder. He lives in Bracknell, Berkshire, with his wife and three-year-old son. \"I left Bombay in April 1999 to go and work for a US-based company as a software manager. That first time was hard. The culture shock was huge; America seemed so casual compared to India, but there was no sense of community. Also there are practical things. We were given an unfurnished house; and I had to buy a car because the streets aren't safe. These things are a challenge in a strange country. \"Coming here was much easier. It's a good idea to wait until you're settled before bringing over the whole family so I came over alone. Then the firm found me a furnished house in Bracknell; it's a nice, neighbourly community where we feel at home. My son has settled well in the local nursery school. Making friends has been easier, too. I've been here for six months, and I'm on a year's permit. If the company wants me to stay I'd love to.\"",

The move opens up a real possibility of overthrowing Mr Milosevic's hold on his legislative power base within the Serbian republic government by the end of this year.</p> <p>The Radicals are the most strident force in Yugoslav politics and their support for the Democratic Opposition of Serbia marks a major political shift.</p> <p>Mr Seselj is a former paramilitary, active during the war in Bosnia. He is famous in Belgrade for waving a gun on the streets on more than one occasion. Most recently, he threatened local journalists, saying they should be \"liquidated\".</p> <p>The Radicals are in the republican government of Serbia with the Socialist party of Slobodan Milosevic and the Yugoslav Left party of his wife, Mira Markovic.</p> <p>Mr Seselj, a highly intelligent man who came top of his class at law school in Belgrade, appears to be a populist, but he is also a political survivor. Many people label him, above all, a \"fascist\".</p> <p>The Radicals' support for Mr Kostunica's coalition is all the more surprising because the blocs were rivals in the election. But soon after the opposition and the Centre for Freedom and Democracy (Cesid) announced their results - both independently declaring Mr Kostunica the winner - the Radicals corroborated the claims with their results.</p> <p>The Radicals' own presidential candidate, Zoran Nikolic, performed miserably.</p> <p>Mr Seselj publicly recognised Mr Kostunica as president on Thursday. He congratulated him and sent a formal letter.</p> <p>Opposition sources say that Mr Seselj also offered the Kostunica camp political help because of the Radicals' power base in the Serbian republic's government.</p> <p>However, Mr Seselj is said to have pointed out that he is a pragmatic politician and explained that he would want something in return for his backing now.</p> <p>The Radicals have in recent days been going back dramatically on their past deeds. Mr Seselj, who signed the order for police to storm the Studio B television studio in May, has now called on Studio B to be brought back under the control of Belgrade city hall.</p> <p>He has called for a repeal of the information law which gagged journalists and newspapers - even though it was a law which he personally wrote.</p> <p>He is also calling for changes in the law governing the state newspaper, Politika. An attack on this by non-regime forces would deny Mr Milosevic a monopoly on information.</p> <p>Mr Seselj and his party have the power to provoke a crisis in the republic's government - but it may be that they decide to stay in government and to work against Mr Milosevic from within.</p> <p>\"It's easy to bring down a government, but we are not in a hurry,\" Mr Seselj said yesterday.</p> <p>Another key political party at republican level is the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) of Vuk Draskovic. His party suffered a terrible drubbing at the federal elections because of his failure to back the Kostunica coalition.</p> <p>He has admitted the error and has congratulated Mr Kostunica. The SPO is currently boycotting republic government sessions, but if it chooses to work with the Radicals, their joint representation in parliament could politically smash the regime at republic level. They could form a government together or, more likely, force republic elections.</p> <p>Mr Kostunica's coalition has made it clear that it wants republican elections by the end of the year. Mr Seselj has so far shown every indication that he will help the opposition to achieve this.</p>",

Mr Seselj is a former paramilitary, active during the war in Bosnia. He is famous in Belgrade for waving a gun on the streets on more than one occasion. Most recently, he threatened local journalists, saying they should be \"liquidated\". The Radicals are in the republican government of Serbia with the Socialist party of Slobodan Milosevic and the Yugoslav Left party of his wife, Mira Markovic. Mr Seselj, a highly intelligent man who came top of his class at law school in Belgrade, appears to be a populist, but he is also a political survivor. Many people label him, above all, a \"fascist\". The Radicals' support for Mr Kostunica's coalition is all the more surprising because the blocs were rivals in the election. But soon after the opposition and the Centre for Freedom and Democracy (Cesid) announced their results - both independently declaring Mr Kostunica the winner - the Radicals corroborated the claims with their results. The Radicals' own presidential candidate, Zoran Nikolic, performed miserably. Mr Seselj publicly recognised Mr Kostunica as president on Thursday. He congratulated him and sent a formal letter. Opposition sources say that Mr Seselj also offered the Kostunica camp political help because of the Radicals' power base in the Serbian republic's government. However, Mr Seselj is said to have pointed out that he is a pragmatic politician and explained that he would want something in return for his backing now. The Radicals have in recent days been going back dramatically on their past deeds. Mr Seselj, who signed the order for police to storm the Studio B television studio in May, has now called on Studio B to be brought back under the control of Belgrade city hall. He has called for a repeal of the information law which gagged journalists and newspapers - even though it was a law which he personally wrote. He is also calling for changes in the law governing the state newspaper, Politika. An attack on this by non-regime forces would deny Mr Milosevic a monopoly on information. Mr Seselj and his party have the power to provoke a crisis in the republic's government - but it may be that they decide to stay in government and to work against Mr Milosevic from within. \"It's easy to bring down a government, but we are not in a hurry,\" Mr Seselj said yesterday. Another key political party at republican level is the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) of Vuk Draskovic. His party suffered a terrible drubbing at the federal elections because of his failure to back the Kostunica coalition. He has admitted the error and has congratulated Mr Kostunica. The SPO is currently boycotting republic government sessions, but if it chooses to work with the Radicals, their joint representation in parliament could politically smash the regime at republic level. They could form a government together or, more likely, force republic elections. Mr Kostunica's coalition has made it clear that it wants republican elections by the end of the year. Mr Seselj has so far shown every indication that he will help the opposition to achieve this.",

None of his circle knew he was gay: such things were all but impossible to admit in his hometown of Plean, a rundown former mining community in Stirlingshire.</p> <p>That night, Gair, a petty crook with a string of previous convictions, was staying in a shabby B&amp;B in west Glasgow. At 10.45pm a friend arrived with bags of chips to share. Gair wanted butties, so he persuaded the night porter to let him in to the locked kitchen. During his trial, the night porter backed up his alibi for this time. After his buttie, Gair went back to the room he shared with Hector Wood, a stranger. Another stranger, Danny Marshall, was also there. The three sat talking.</p> <p>At 11.15pm Smith was murdered. Mr Marshall and Mr Wood could offer alibis for Gair. But, though a special defence of alibi was lodged, the two were never called to give evidence.</p> <p>On April 12, Gair was called in by police investigating a robbery. By his admission, he was cocky. When detectives found he was from Plean, however, the atmosphere changed. Gair says he had never met Smith, but he was charged with his murder.</p> <p>Three weeks later a man called Willie MacLeod was stopped by a police officer in Glasgow, who told him he resembled a photofit, and took him in for questioning. Detectives asked MacLeod if he knew Smith and Gair. He now says he did not know them, but lyingly said he did. \"They told me they had witnesses that had seen us, and then they said it was a murder; and I panicked. Next thing I knew I had been charged with murder,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Mr MacLeod told detectives he and Gair had taken Smith down an alleyway to mug him, Gair had stabbed Smith, and he had run away. He now says this was a lie, proffered only because he was terrified.</p> <p>Mr MacLeod was remanded in Glasgow's notorious Barlinnie prison. It was there, he says, he first met Gair. On the morning of the trial, all charges against Mr MacLeod were dropped. But when he took the stand he told what he says is the truth. In the afternoon he changed his story; then he changed it again. That night he was charged with perjury. The next morning he was asked to take the stand again. Facing seven years in jail, he fingered Gair.</p> <p>Three others testified, a gay man and two rent boys. They say they lied because they were intimidated. A fourth man now admits he picked Gair at an identity parade because a police officer had shown him a photo beforehand.</p> <p>Only two people who placed Gair around the murder scene have not withdrawn their testimony - a policeman and policewoman out on the beat that night. One is now dead, the other says she now does not remember; neither was otherwise involved in the case.</p> <p>On conviction, by a jury's eight-to-seven majority, Gair spent much time in solitary confinement until, at Glenochil prison, he met Dr McGregor. He began a campaign on Gair's behalf and found him a new solicitor, John Macaulay, who drew up Gair's appeal; Dr McGregor's campaigning, however, meant he was forced to resign. But he was successful, even convincing Mr Smith's sister, Anne, that Gair was innocent. Yesterday she welcomed his release: \"I am glad to see Stuart go free, but I am angry justice has not been done for my brother.</p> <p>\"Hopefully the truth will come out. The trial was a farce, it was a disgrace, and people have the right to know the truth.\"</p>",

Gair wanted butties, so he persuaded the night porter to let him in to the locked kitchen. During his trial, the night porter backed up his alibi for this time. After his buttie, Gair went back to the room he shared with Hector Wood, a stranger. Another stranger, Danny Marshall, was also there. The three sat talking. At 11.15pm Smith was murdered. Mr Marshall and Mr Wood could offer alibis for Gair. But, though a special defence of alibi was lodged, the two were never called to give evidence. On April 12, Gair was called in by police investigating a robbery. By his admission, he was cocky. When detectives found he was from Plean, however, the atmosphere changed. Gair says he had never met Smith, but he was charged with his murder. Three weeks later a man called Willie MacLeod was stopped by a police officer in Glasgow, who told him he resembled a photofit, and took him in for questioning. Detectives asked MacLeod if he knew Smith and Gair. He now says he did not know them, but lyingly said he did. \"They told me they had witnesses that had seen us, and then they said it was a murder; and I panicked. Next thing I knew I had been charged with murder,\" he told the Guardian. Mr MacLeod told detectives he and Gair had taken Smith down an alleyway to mug him, Gair had stabbed Smith, and he had run away. He now says this was a lie, proffered only because he was terrified. Mr MacLeod was remanded in Glasgow's notorious Barlinnie prison. It was there, he says, he first met Gair. On the morning of the trial, all charges against Mr MacLeod were dropped. But when he took the stand he told what he says is the truth. In the afternoon he changed his story; then he changed it again. That night he was charged with perjury. The next morning he was asked to take the stand again. Facing seven years in jail, he fingered Gair. Three others testified, a gay man and two rent boys. They say they lied because they were intimidated. A fourth man now admits he picked Gair at an identity parade because a police officer had shown him a photo beforehand. Only two people who placed Gair around the murder scene have not withdrawn their testimony - a policeman and policewoman out on the beat that night. One is now dead, the other says she now does not remember; neither was otherwise involved in the case. On conviction, by a jury's eight-to-seven majority, Gair spent much time in solitary confinement until, at Glenochil prison, he met Dr McGregor. He began a campaign on Gair's behalf and found him a new solicitor, John Macaulay, who drew up Gair's appeal; Dr McGregor's campaigning, however, meant he was forced to resign. But he was successful, even convincing Mr Smith's sister, Anne, that Gair was innocent. Yesterday she welcomed his release: \"I am glad to see Stuart go free, but I am angry justice has not been done for my brother. \"Hopefully the truth will come out. The trial was a farce, it was a disgrace, and people have the right to know the truth.\"",

And if they miss what might prove to be an extremely tight flotation/trade sale window, a vicious circle might even set in where credit rating agencies downgrade the telecoms' credit worthiness, raising their cost of borrowing just at a point when they need to invest heavily to roll out new phone services. </p> <p>Scary stuff - and also deeply ironic, since the regulators now doing the inquiries were set up by the governments who milked the mobile phone industry in the first place. By the time auctions and allocations across Europe are finished, the 3G license windfall is expected to be close to \u00a3100bn. </p> <p>But should banks be top of the fret-list? Among British institutions, HSBC is believed to have \u00a312bn of exposure to telecoms firms and Barclays about \u00a38.5bn. Yet Vodafone and BT still carry a combined stock market capitalisation of around \u00a3200bn (despite their lousy performance) and Finland's Nokia is worth a further \u00a3130bn. </p> <p>Since these huge companies carry premium weightings in benchmark investment indices such as the FTSE 100 and Dow Jones Stoxx 50, just about all major European investment funds (using real pension and insurance money) are heavily exposed. Pressuring the banks to reduce their exposures now might simply be transferring the problem. </p> <p>That bright spark at the Treasury, who came up with the auction wheeze in the first place, may have a lot to answer for. </p> <p><strong> Bad Apple </strong><br> </p> <p>Rotten jokes were strewn all over the place yesterday as an overnight profits warning from Apple poisoned the markets and caused shares in the alternative computer firm to halve in value. </p> <p>The news looked all the more significant coming just a week after a warning on earnings from computer chip company Intel. Apple reported weak demand in one of its key markets, education, and also owned up to slower than expected sales of its new Cube processor. Intel blame weakness in the euro for its woes, and also the decline of dot.com mania in Europe. </p> <p>Yet the bad news from these two companies has not infected the rest of the IT barrel in the United States. </p> <p>In fact, a recent statement from database specialist Oracle said, in as many words, that the firm did not know what Intel was talking about. And, despite all the talk about a sector-wide slowdown, shares in PC supplier Gateway actually went up yesterday. </p> <p>Intel and Apple, of course, have their own specific problems. Intel has been hit by a string of embarrassments over new products and also resurgent competition from the likes of AMD. </p> <p>In the case of Apple, expectations over the rebirth of the firm, hinging on hopes that desktop couture might outweigh limitations on compatibility, had become heavily overblown. </p> <p>As for the severity of yesterday's share price fall at Apple, founder Steve Jobs already knows how unforgiving the markets can be.</p>",

And if they miss what might prove to be an extremely tight flotation/trade sale window, a vicious circle might even set in where credit rating agencies downgrade the telecoms' credit worthiness, raising their cost of borrowing just at a point when they need to invest heavily to roll out new phone services. Scary stuff - and also deeply ironic, since the regulators now doing the inquiries were set up by the governments who milked the mobile phone industry in the first place. By the time auctions and allocations across Europe are finished, the 3G license windfall is expected to be close to \u00a3100bn. But should banks be top of the fret-list? Among British institutions, HSBC is believed to have \u00a312bn of exposure to telecoms firms and Barclays about \u00a38.5bn. Yet Vodafone and BT still carry a combined stock market capitalisation of around \u00a3200bn (despite their lousy performance) and Finland's Nokia is worth a further \u00a3130bn. Since these huge companies carry premium weightings in benchmark investment indices such as the FTSE 100 and Dow Jones Stoxx 50, just about all major European investment funds (using real pension and insurance money) are heavily exposed. Pressuring the banks to reduce their exposures now might simply be transferring the problem. That bright spark at the Treasury, who came up with the auction wheeze in the first place, may have a lot to answer for. Bad Apple Rotten jokes were strewn all over the place yesterday as an overnight profits warning from Apple poisoned the markets and caused shares in the alternative computer firm to halve in value. The news looked all the more significant coming just a week after a warning on earnings from computer chip company Intel. Apple reported weak demand in one of its key markets, education, and also owned up to slower than expected sales of its new Cube processor. Intel blame weakness in the euro for its woes, and also the decline of dot.com mania in Europe. Yet the bad news from these two companies has not infected the rest of the IT barrel in the United States. In fact, a recent statement from database specialist Oracle said, in as many words, that the firm did not know what Intel was talking about. And, despite all the talk about a sector-wide slowdown, shares in PC supplier Gateway actually went up yesterday. Intel and Apple, of course, have their own specific problems. Intel has been hit by a string of embarrassments over new products and also resurgent competition from the likes of AMD. In the case of Apple, expectations over the rebirth of the firm, hinging on hopes that desktop couture might outweigh limitations on compatibility, had become heavily overblown. As for the severity of yesterday's share price fall at Apple, founder Steve Jobs already knows how unforgiving the markets can be.",

It was good to hear John Prescott denounce the bullying hypocrites of the Countryside Alliance (Prescott mobilises activists, September 29). These people should have been denounced right from the day of their first march. If the government now takes a firm stand and crushes any further attempt to disrupt fuel supplies, public confidence will soon be restored. The moaning minnies who sit whingeing in the corners of bars will still be whingeing, but then they always will. David Burgess Hawkhurst, Kent \u0095The sight of Blair basking in the reflected glory of Nelson Mandela (Feelgood factor, September 29) prompts the thought that it was the much derided \"hard left\" of the political spectrum whom Mandela needs to thank. It was they who spent year after year picketing Barclays and the South African embassy. How would New Labour treat such activists? Val Mainwood Wivenhoe \u0095Nelson Mandela's wrap-up speech at the Labour party conference made me wonder which senior statesman of impeccable standing and with strong links to the party could do a similar job for the Tories.

Start work and every thought will be interrupted by that familiar ping, as another email drops into your in-tray. </p> <p>Steven Roberts, a freelance copywriter, is concerned by the impact email has had on office communication. \"Recently,\" he recalls, \"I was working in the offices of a large television company. Nobody spoke to each other - virtually all information was communicated by email. Several times, I announced to my boss that I'd finished a job, only to be told to repeat this information by email and then to await my next instructions by email too. And my boss was sitting right next to me!\" </p> <p>I'm old enough (just) to remember the days before email became a ubiquitous feature in the workplace. The days when people spoke to each other, arranged meetings using diaries and only asked the appropriate person if they had a query, not the entire company. </p> <p>I'm not a Luddite. I can navigate my way round the web, possess a fax and a mobile phone and, as I write this, digital television is being installed in my living room. But I can't be the only person who feels that email is taking over the office, at the cost of conversation and efficiency. </p> <p>According to the experts, I'm being alarmist. Psychologist Guy Fielding, a communications specialist at Oxford University, does not agree that email is replacing other forms of office communication. \"Most people mistakenly believe in the substitution model for how communication channels work,\" he says. \"We think that when a new form of communication comes along it eliminates the others - the telephone, for example, stops people travelling to see each other or writing letters. </p> <p>\"There's a lot of evidence that this isn't the case. In fact, people who use the telephone the most also travel the most - and every year the number of letters sent increases by 5% to 10%.\" </p> <p>Guy believes all channels of communication work as a network, feeding each other. For example, the person you're most likely to telephone is someone you already know face to face. And phonecalls are often made to set up face-to-face meetings. </p> <p>\"When you introduce a new communications medium like email, it has more of an impact on how the other channels are used, not on whether they're used,\" he states. \"People shift some of their activity out of the old channels but continue to use them, but only for the purpose best suited to them.\" </p> <p>The problem is that this process can take time. When a new medium is first introduced, people get a little over-excited about its potential, which leads to overuse - hence the flurry of email jokes, chain letters and inane messages wending their way around your office. </p> <p>Blame it on the innovators of the system, says Guy. \"Naturally, they claim it's the system to replace all other systems, but that's not true. In the first flush of enthusiasm people try to do everything using the new medium. </p> <p>\"After a while they learn it doesn't work. When they return to the old systems, their use is refined because they've added another channel of communication. Email is not destructive of other forms of communication. In fact, it probably has the opposite effect.\" </p> <p>Adam Joinson, a psychologist at the Open University, says that far from inhibiting or disrupting office communication, email has many benefits. \"It's a great tool for brainstorming, decision-making and getting diverse groups in organisations - such as marketing and accounts - to talk to each other. If someone puts you on the spot by asking a question, you may answer rashly. </p> <p>But using email gives you the time to craft a sensible, articulate response. It's also a great aid to memory: rather than reminding people one by one of a meeting organised weeks ago, you can send a single email.\" </p> <p>Adam believes that we tend to over-emphasise how great face-to-face communication is. \"When you listen to people talking face-to-face, most of it is not as coherent as you'd expect. In speech, a lot is implied. But in writing you have to focus on your message and spell it out.\" </p> <p>Adam has just completed a study comparing levels of self-disclosure in email and face-to-face communication. In the first part of the study, people using a computer chat programme were compared with a group talking face to face. Observers rated how many times they self-disclosed in the course of the conversation. The result? The people using email disclosed four times as much as those conversing face-to-face. </p> <p>The second part of the study compared email users with those using email and a video-conferencing camera. Again, those who couldn't see each other disclosed more. \"Being able to see each other actually reduces the amount of social communication,\" says Adam. \"When they can't see each other, people are more focused and less concerned about being judged. We spend a lot of time focusing on controlling our non-verbal communication - maintaining eye contact, the way we sit, the tone of our voice etc. When using email we can concentrate on the message, not the way we present it.\" </p> <p>Email is a great tool for breaking down boundaries. Disability, accent, ethnic origin, dress sense and attractiveness become irrelevant. Instead - and this is the downside - we are judged on the speed of our response and our way with words. </p> <p>Adam says workers need to be trained in email use. \"Research has shown that people who have problems with the amount of emails coming in don't know how to organise them into folders. People aren't properly trained in who to send messages to, or basic email etiquette - like not sending jokes or requests to everyone. Bosses should teach their staff to only check their emails a certain number of times per day so they're not constantly being interrupted.\" </p> <p>Many workplaces are cracking down on email use, by forbidding chain emails and personal messages. Adam says that it's important to maintain a balance, so that the social benefits of email aren't lost. \"If email use is too tightly controlled, it will stop brainstorming and the forming of communities.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government has revealed that the retired navy commander who recruited Hull seamen as amateur spies in the cold war years, up to the mysterious sinking of the fishing trawler Gaul in 1974, was a member of the secret intelligence service MI6. The admission, made in a two-page affidavit from the Ministry of Defence to the high court, has angered the families of the 36 Gaul crew who lost their lives. They have always suspected that the trawler, which went down in the Barents sea off the coast of Norway, was scuttled by the Russians while on an espionage mission for the Royal Navy. But their effort to get at the facts has been a long and frustrating journey. \"For 26 years we have had lots of lies and deceit and this shows yet another one,\" said Roy Clark, a member of the Gaul Family Association who lost his son Paul. Mike Sturgeon, whose father Maurice was the crew's mate, said he now hoped that MI6 would open its files on the intelligence operation. \"I just want the truth,\" he said. MI6's supervision of the spying operation may explain why it was not until three years ago that the Ministry of Defence made the limited admission that Hull boats had been used for surveillance of Russian ships and submarines during the 1960s and early 1970s. The fate of the Gaul has been one of the enduring mysteries of the cold war and it is still under formal investigation by the former wreck commissioner, high court judge Sir David Steel. His inquiry is not expected to begin until next year after the wreck is officially reinspected. It was set up last year after a report by the maritime accident investigation branch concluded that the vessel had been swamped by heavy seas entering unsecured deck hatches. But an examination of the wreck by remote cameras failed to find any human remains or personal effects. To assist Sir David's inquiry, the MoD asked Commander Timothy Clark, a member of the defence intelligence staff, to review ministry records. In his affidavit he says: \"I have seen in the MoD records reference to a Cdr Brookes as an intelligence liaison officer in Hull with the crews of fishing trawlers. He retired from the Royal Navy in 1960 and I understand that from then until his death in January 1971 he was a member of the secret intelligence services.\" Until now everyone concerned about the case has assumed that Brookes was merely a retired officer who provided the skippers with specialised cameras and recording equipment to gather intelligence for the Royal Navy. Cdr Clark's affidavit reiterates government information finally released in 1998 that up to 40 trawlers, occasionally carrying surveillance navy personnel, were used for intelligence gathering during the period. In a carefully worded conclusion he said: \"I can confirm from MoD records I have examined, that no record is held which indicates that any member of the crew of the MV Gaul was, or had been, engaged in intelligence activities for the Royal Navy.\" But since \"no records of trawler personnel involved in this activity exist in MoD files\", Cdr Clark adds: \"It cannot be stated with absolute certainty that none of the crew... had been briefed on intelligence collection, or issued with photographic or radio equipment, during the 12 months before the loss.\" Former Hull seamen have recently testified that both Maurice Sturgeon and the skipper, Peter Nellist, had been on surveillance and hardware recovery operations on other vessels in 1968 and 1972. Cdr Clark leaves open the possibility that MI6's operations were more extensive than anyone involved in the case has realised. \"It is apparent that other intelligence organisations were also involved in intelligence gathering in the Barents sea area in the 1960s,\" he says. Max Gold, the Hull solicitor who represents the crew's families, said yesterday: \"It is vital new information, very peculiar but not surprising. There has been deliberate deception all along.\" Mr Gold has written to the Russian ambassador asking for Moscow's intelligence records to be opened. \"What the families really want to know is, what happened to their loved ones and where are their remains,\" he said.",

This is not surprising, given the fact Interactive is one of the better funded net companies, with around \u00a360m of cash on its balance sheet. Blue-chip shares, meanwhile, closed a volatile session higher helped by a strong performance from index heavyweight Vodafone, which rose 4.25p to 252.5p. At the the close the FTSE 100 index was 30.1 points higher at 6,294.2, with BAT putting on the best performance.

Consumer goods company Unilever advanced 14.5p to 438p as the market warmed to Thursday's EU clearance of its \u00a314.5b acquisition of US food company group BestFoods. Completion of the deal is expected next week. Railtrack rose 28.5p to \u00a311.09 after UBS Warburg lifted its rating to \"strong buy\" from \"buy\". On the down side, music-publishing group EMI slipped 15p to 540p amid fresh concerns over European regulatory opposition to its proposed merger with Time Warner's music division Thursday's news that FTSE International, the index provider, will introduce new rules that will led to a radical re-weighting of UK indices hit cable company Telewest, 6p lower at 147.75p, and BSkyB, off 35p at \u00a310.41. As things stand, Telewest weighing in the FTSE 100 will fall 70% and BSkyB's will decline 60% once the changes are implemented Retail group Marks &amp; Spencer fell 5p to 203p on talk CSFB has slashed its profits forecasts again. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 gained 4.2 points to 6,676.9, while the Techmark advanced 19.61 points to 3,734.85. Media group SMG stood out among the mid caps, rising 20.5p to 277p, with dealers attributing the rise to bargain hunting. In the past four trading sessions SMG shares have fallen more than 50p. Conglomerate Tomkins dipped 7.5p to 165p after it said it had detected signs of a slowdown in its major market. Steel group Corus dropped 2.25p to 51.25p unsettled by the claim of a Dutch trade union leader who is reported to have said the group could be dead within the year.

Mr Girling said: \"It is disappointing to report that, after investing so much time and effort, we have been unable to reach agreement within the time frame anticipated. We have, however, made significant progress in the second half and remain hopeful of reaching agreement on satisfactory commercial terms.\" Brokers downgraded their forecasts for this year accordingly but the profit warning failed to make a longer term impact. House broker UBS Warburg is holding its pre-exceptional profits forecast at \u00a314.9m for 1999/2000 while the following year forecast is for \u00a317.3m. Despite the increased provisioning, Warburg has set a \u00a310 target on the shares. Yesterday's statement should be a blip. Earlier this week, the government announced an extension of the national grid for learning programme which has increased funding for IT in the education sector from \u00a3450m between 2000/2002 to \u00a3710m over 2003/2004.",

They were strong supporters of Tudjman's nationalist government.</p> <p>In the letter they noted \"with bitterness\" that the 1991 war against Yugoslavia has been presented \"as a crime and something filthy, while in fact it was the foundation of Croatia's freedom, independence and sovereignty\".</p> <p>They accused Mr Mesic and the government of \"waging a campaign to smear the independence struggle through recent spectacular arrests\".</p> <p>The generals were referring to the new government's decision to hold trials as well as to cooperate with the war-crimes tribunal in the Hague, even if the perpetrators were Croats.</p> <p>Investigators from the tribunal began looking for the graves of an estimated 120 Serbs in Gospic, central Croatia, earlier this year.</p> <p>In forcing them into retirement, Mr Mesic cited a constitutional ban against senior military officials publicly airing political views. \"My message to those who think they can bring down the government with pamphlets is that they are playing the wrong hand,\" he said, adding that the army must be \"depoliticised\".</p> <p>\"Whoever wants to be involved in politics has the right to do so; I won't suggest which party they should join. But while they are in the army they will not be publishing pamphlets,\" Mr Mesic said.</p> <p>The generals' protest follows the arrest earlier this month of four Croats suspected of killing Serb civilians in Gospic in 1991. Police also arrested several soldiers accused of slaughtering civilians in neighbouring Bosnia.</p> <p>Angry war veterans have been demonstrating against the arrests in Gospic on a daily basis for several weeks.</p> <p>In September, Milan Levar, a key witness, was killed by a bomb outside his home in Gospic. He had helped to defend the town in 1991 when local Serbs rebelled against Croatia's declaration of independence. But he was so shocked by his own side's actions that he decided to give evidence to the war-crimes tribunal in the Hague.</p> <p>Reporters in Gospic were threatened by the crowd during an arrest there two weeks ago. A radio reporter in Zagreb was also accosted by a man who put a pistol into his mouth, threatening to kill him.</p> <p>Ironically, despite Croatia's willingness to work with the Hague tribunal as well as to conduct its own trials, there is some resentment in Zagreb about the west's rush to lift sanctions on Yugoslavia and forget the war-crimes issue once Mr Milosevic leaves power. \"I don't think sanctions should be lifted until Yugoslavia does what we did: adopt a law on cooperation with the Hague tribunal and extradite its war-crimes suspects,\" Mr Mesic said this week.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The president of Croatia, Stipe Mesic, yesterday sacked seven army generals for complaining that the government was insulting the memory of the country's war for independence by prosecuting alleged war criminals for atrocities committed against Serbs. Mr Mesic's tough move was a sign of how far things have moved since the death of President Franjo Tudjman and the election of a liberal government which wants to restore links with the rest of Europe. As well as being a rare case of a country willing to try its former military elite - not just for corruption but for war crimes - Croatia's trials could be a precursor to similar action in Serbia, if the opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, succeeds in removing Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, from power. Although he has criticised the international criminal tribunal in the Hague for being an instrument of US interests, Mr Kostunica has left open the option of starting war crimes trials or a state-sponsored \"truth commission\" in Serbia. He says Serbia must confront its role in the last decade of Yugoslavia's civil wars. The seven Croatian generals who were sacked yesterday - Ante Gotovina, Kresimir Cosic, Damir Krsticevic, Ivan Kapular, Milenko Filipovic, Davor Domazet-Lose and Mirko Norac - were among 12 active and retired generals who made their allegations in an open letter published on Thursday. They were strong supporters of Tudjman's nationalist government. In the letter they noted \"with bitterness\" that the 1991 war against Yugoslavia has been presented \"as a crime and something filthy, while in fact it was the foundation of Croatia's freedom, independence and sovereignty\". They accused Mr Mesic and the government of \"waging a campaign to smear the independence struggle through recent spectacular arrests\". The generals were referring to the new government's decision to hold trials as well as to cooperate with the war-crimes tribunal in the Hague, even if the perpetrators were Croats. Investigators from the tribunal began looking for the graves of an estimated 120 Serbs in Gospic, central Croatia, earlier this year. In forcing them into retirement, Mr Mesic cited a constitutional ban against senior military officials publicly airing political views. \"My message to those who think they can bring down the government with pamphlets is that they are playing the wrong hand,\" he said, adding that the army must be \"depoliticised\". \"Whoever wants to be involved in politics has the right to do so; I won't suggest which party they should join. But while they are in the army they will not be publishing pamphlets,\" Mr Mesic said. The generals' protest follows the arrest earlier this month of four Croats suspected of killing Serb civilians in Gospic in 1991. Police also arrested several soldiers accused of slaughtering civilians in neighbouring Bosnia. Angry war veterans have been demonstrating against the arrests in Gospic on a daily basis for several weeks. In September, Milan Levar, a key witness, was killed by a bomb outside his home in Gospic. He had helped to defend the town in 1991 when local Serbs rebelled against Croatia's declaration of independence. But he was so shocked by his own side's actions that he decided to give evidence to the war-crimes tribunal in the Hague. Reporters in Gospic were threatened by the crowd during an arrest there two weeks ago. A radio reporter in Zagreb was also accosted by a man who put a pistol into his mouth, threatening to kill him. Ironically, despite Croatia's willingness to work with the Hague tribunal as well as to conduct its own trials, there is some resentment in Zagreb about the west's rush to lift sanctions on Yugoslavia and forget the war-crimes issue once Mr Milosevic leaves power. \"I don't think sanctions should be lifted until Yugoslavia does what we did: adopt a law on cooperation with the Hague tribunal and extradite its war-crimes suspects,\" Mr Mesic said this week.",

In unusually direct criticism of his successor, the former president told a South African newspaper that he shared the \"dominant opinion that prevails throughout the world\" that HIV causes Aids, and that he would only change his mind if science proved \"conclusively that that view is wrong\". Mr Mandela, who this week told the Labour party conference in Brighton that Aids was killing 10 teachers a week in South Africa, went on to say that public figures should not flirt with unscientific theories when so much was at stake. \"I would like to be careful because, for people in our position, when you take a stand, you might find that established principles are undermined, sometimes without scientific backing,\" he said. Mr Mandela has previously shied from open criticism of his successor on Aids and other issues, but the former president had said that he believed the disease was the greatest threat facing Africa. He said the government's focus should be on combating Aids through education and treatment, not on debates about its causes. The ground for Mr Mandela's condemnation was laid last week by similarly direct attacks on Mr Mbeki's stance on Aids: South Africa's powerful trade union confederation called the link between HIV and the disease \"irrefutable\", and the Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, Njongonkulu Ndungane, likened the government's refusal to supply drugs to HIV-positive people as \"as serious a crime against humanity as apartheid\".

      "bodyText": "The most hallowed ground in the holy city - and the volatile core of the Israeli-Arab conflict - was doused in blood yesterday as rioting between Muslim worshippers and Israeli police left four Palestinians dead, and as many as 200 wounded. The violence erupted at the close of afternoon prayers when Israeli riot police stormed the Haram al-Sharif, the site of the Dome of the Rock that is the third-holiest shrine in Islam, firing live rounds and rubber bullets at stone-throwing Palestinian youths. Dozens of police, including the Jerusalem police chief, were hit by stones after the violence was stoked by the arrival of more than 22,000 people for prayer. With peace negotiations locked for weeks over the fate of the Haram - which Jews claim as the site of their destroyed temple - and Israel mourning a border policeman who was killed by a member of the Palestinian security forces earlier yesterday, the clashes could escalate out of control; violence also broke out in several areas of the West Bank. It was the second consecutive day of rioting on the Haram, following the provocative visit there on Thursday by the leader of the hardline Likud party, Ariel Sharon, in a blatant display of Israel's iron grip on the heart of Muslim Jerusalem. By the time the muezzin called the faithful to prayer yesterday, tempers were menacingly high, with Palestinians bridling at the large Israeli presence on their hallowed ground. \"It is forbidden for them to come inside with their sticks. This makes our young men explode,\" said Sami Bibi, who lives in east Jerusalem, occupied illegally by Israel since 1967. \"When I was praying they were hanging over my head.\" The Israelis say scuffles broke out when Palestinians began raining stones on the heads of Jewish worshippers at the Wailing Wall, below the Haram.

His disdain for Quebec nationalism, belief in a bilingual, multicultural federation and commitment to the constitutional entrenchment of civic rights and freedoms were the hallmarks of his 17 years in government.</p> <p>Elected to the Canadian parliament in 1965, he rose meteorically to the leadership of the Liberal party in 1968. He won three successive general elections, lost to the Conservatives in 1979, then led the Liberals back to power in 1980. In his final government, he secured a clear No vote in Quebec's first referendum on sovereignty-association, and entrenched Canada's constitution with a charter of rights and freedoms.</p> <p>Trudeau was born in Montreal in 1919 - a date confirmed only after he won the Liberal leadership, claiming to be a year younger than he was. His mother had Scottish and French-Canadian roots. His father was pur laine Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, an ambitious Montreal lawyer from a long line of unilingual peasant-farmers. Though his early death traumatised Pierre, his shrewd business deals secured the family a $1m fortune.</p> <p>By all accounts, Trudeau was a competitive young man, encouraged by his father to achieve athletic prowess and educated with disciplined intensity at Br\u00e9buf, the Jesuit college for Quebec's francophone elite. Physically and intellectually agile, he had a need to win or have the final word.</p> <p>After completing law school in 1943 - while campaigning against conscription - and articling for a year in Montreal, he took courses in political economy at Harvard, the Sorbonne and the London School of Economics, where he mastered ideas of constitutional liberalism, Parisian personalism and British Fabianism, before heading home via a year-long journey through the Middle East and Asia.</p> <p>Back in Quebec in 1949, Trudeau was shocked to find Quebec gripped by the regressive, Catholic nationalism that underscored Maurice Duplessis's corrupt Union Nationale govern- ment. Gerard Pelletier, a journalist he befriended in Paris, invited him to witness an asbestos workers' strike, an event that reinforced Trudeau's determination to oppose Duplessis and brought him and Pelletier into contact with the union leader, Jean Marchand, for the first time.</p> <p>Like many Quebec intellectuals who loathed Duplessis, Trudeau escaped to Ottawa and a junior job in the Privy Council Office preparing background material for constitutional conferences. He found the federal capital dull, and its bureaucracy patronising to French-Canadians, so returned to Quebec in 1951, worked as a civil liberties lawyer for the labour movement and edited a collection, The Asbestos Strike, challenging Duplessis. Consequently blocked from an academic law position at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, he co-founded Cit\u00e9 Libre, a journal that called for reason over nationalist passion. Federalism, by virtue of bringing diverse ethnic groups into a single state, he argued, would allow Frenchness to thrive in Canada.</p> <p>Duplessis died in 1959 and Quebec underwent a quiet revolution. The provincial Liberals won the 1960 election and created a welfare state to replace the Catholic church in healthcare and education. While most Quebec intellectuals welcomed this period, Trudeau used the university post he quickly acquired to attack the secular neo-nationalism of the Quebec state and the separatist movement it spawned. On November 5 1965, he stood with Marchand and Pelletier in the federal election, determined to address the French-Canadian question from Ottawa.</p> <p>Had the Quebec wing of the Liberal party been stronger, and Prime Minister Lester Pearson not been facing nationalist militancy in the province, the three men might have had fewer opportunities to influence the debate. As it was, in December 1965, Marchand persuaded Pearson to make Trudeau his parliamentary secretary, a job that gave him status within the Quebec caucus, access to the centres of government power and the international experience of travelling through the Francophonie to build support against Quebec separatism. In April 1967, Trudeau entered Pearson's cabinet as justice minister.</p> <p>It was the centennial summer, when President de Gaulle, touring Canada, called for \"Le Qu\u00e9bec Libre\". But the erudite bachelor Trudeau, who rode a Harley-Davidson and wore sandals in the legislature, worked through it, doggedly revising the criminal code. He modernised laws on divorce, homosexuality and abortion, arguing that \"the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation\".</p> <p>Precisely what went on in Trudeau's own bedroom was always a subject of speculation. His extended bachelorhood and homosexual law reform encouraged rumours. But it was his liaisons with women that inverted his mantra of \"reason over passion\". There was nightclubbing at Commonwealth conferences, an affair with Barbra Streisand, and his secret marriage in 1971 to Margaret Sinclair, a beautiful, west coast flower child of a former cabinet minister. Some 30 years his junior, she bore him three children, helped win the 1974 election and then rebelled with doped-out indiscretions.</p> <p>Trudeaumania took root in February 1968, when he announced his candidacy for the Liberal leadership, soon after a televised showdown with Quebec's premier. He was the only French-Canadian running to head a party that alternates between francophone and anglophone leaders. His charisma and ability to reason clearly in both languages appealed at a time when Quebec tensions were, quite literally, exploding in mail-boxes around Montreal. Canadians adored this sexy genius, who wanted to create a \"just society\".</p> <p>On April 6 1968, after four ballots and seven-and-a-half hours of voting, Trudeau set out to rebuild Canada in his own image... \"this beautiful, rich and energetic country of ours can become a model in which every citizen will enjoy his fundamental rights, in which two great linguistic communities and people of many cultures will live in harmony and in which every individual will find fulfilment.\" Three weeks later, sworn in as Canada's 15th prime minister, he called a general election and, on June 25 1968, the day after nationalist demonstrators stoned him in Montreal, he secured the first federal Liberal majority since 1953.</p> <p>Trudeau set Canada on as independent a foreign policy course as possible in north America, opening diplomatic relations with China and reducing Canada's commitment to Nato. But his primary concerns were to counter Quebec nationalism, build national unity, overhaul government and ensure Canada's constitutional decolonisation.</p> <p>The 1969 Official Languages Act was his key response to state-centred nationalism in Quebec. It institutionalised bilingualism, created a federal bureaucracy that employs French-Canadians at every level, and delivers services in French and English. The strategy aimed to attract bright young francophones to work in Ottawa, not Quebec, and ensure that the provincial francophone majority, and the francophone minorities elsewhere, identified with the federal state.</p> <p>Like so many of Trudeau's ideas, it was brilliant in principle but problematic in practice. It granted individual rights and new employment opportunities to French-Canadians, reduced the domination of anglophone mandarins in Ottawa, but failed to counter Quebec nationalism's mystical appeal or anticipate the backlash. Although Trudeau tried to enhance national unity with a department of regional and economic expansion, he never undercut the resentment that citizens west of Winnipeg felt about his obsession with Quebec. Trudeau restructured the cabinet committee system, expanded the prime minister's office, and engaged the Liberal party in a massive, exercise of policy innovation, establishing task forces on everything. Though designed to build policy on liberal principles and encourage participation in his \"just society\", these measures frustrated the party faithful, who were used to brokerage politics, and irritated the electorate when policymaking took too damn long.</p> <p>Trudeau's rationality was fundamentally challenged on October 5 1970, when the terrorist Front de Lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) kidnapped James Cross, the British trade commisioner in Montreal. Five days later, the FLQ abducted (and later murdered) the Quebec labour minister, Pierre Laporte. Urged on by Quebec's liberal premier, Robert Bourassa, Trudeau took the drastic step of invoking the War Measures Act in peacetime.</p> <p>His popularity soared, but the promoter of civil liberties had put the military on the streets, suspended habeas corpus and legitimised massive arrests of FLQ suspects. Civil libertarians and Quebec nationalists never forgave him.</p> <p>When Trudeau called a general election in 1972 - with the slogan \"The Land is Strong\" - his campaign strategy proved weak. The love-in was over, and unemployment had soared. In his drive to bilingualise Canada, calm insurrection in Quebec, and overhaul Ottawa, he had forgotten to oil the party machine, failed to curb inflation and dismissed the bilingual backlash as bigotry. The Liberals scraped back to power with 109 seats, against the Tories' 107, and Trudeau formed a minority government with support from the New Democratic party (NDP).</p> <p>Trudeau, the pragmatist, now surrounded himself with professional party men. His speeches became emotional, his contacts with the party faithful more personal, and policy implementation was faster as deals were forged with the NDP. Pensions and family allowances increased, and the Foreign Investment Review Agency was created to boost economic sovereignty. After two years, he went back to the electorate with Margaret at his side, and the Liberals secured a majority third term.</p> <p>Although Trudeau and his cabinet reverted to protracted planning exercises, creating a new tax structure to redistribute resources from richer to poorer provinces, he ensured Canada's entry to the G7 group and initiated trade contracts with the EEC, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific rim. Petro-Canada was created to placate westerners and, in 1978, the Canadian Human Rights Commission was established to root out discrimination. But inflation and unemployment spiralled as the Liberals found themselves unable to cope with the impact of the 1973 oil crisis.</p> <p>In October 1976, they reversed their election promise, established the Anti-Inflation Board and imposed wage and price controls. To cap it all, in November 1976, Trudeau's old rival, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e8vesque, led the nationalist Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) to victory in the provincial election, determined to seek a new sovereign-association between Quebec and Canada. PQ's victory re-energised Trudeau's fight against nationalism, but by now Margaret was against him. She spent their sixth wedding anniversary at a Rolling Stones concert, and told People magazine that her nipple outlines excited state visitors. Two months later, the couple separated.</p> <p>In May 1979, the Liberals' inability to boost the Canadian economy brought Joe Clark's Conservatives to minority government. Trudeau was shattered and, in November, he announced his retirement.</p> <p>But it was not the end. Three weeks later, the Conservative government was defeated. Trudeau stayed on, and, in February 1980, won another majority government. In that final term, there was the second oil crisis, an intensification of energy battles with western Canada and new tensions in the US-Canadian relationship after Ronald Reagan won the presidency. But the May 1980 Quebec referendum produced a clear 60-40 victory for the federalists, and a historic battle between Levesque and Trudeau.</p> <p>For Levesque it was horrendous. If the Conservatives had stayed in power, his social-democratic government would have had an easier time promoting sovereignty-association. But Trudeau's icy logic exposed sovereignty association as a weak compromise that would ensure Quebec's eventual secession. Days before the plebiscite, he promised Quebeckers that if they voted No he would renew the constitution.</p> <p>He did just that. On May 21 1980, he set about getting the constitution patriated from Britain. Over lunch at Downing Street, he informed Mrs Thatcher that the Canadian constitution was coming home - although neither she, nor her advisers, had enough understanding of Canadian constitutional politics to anticipate what followed.</p> <p>In October 1980, having failed yet again to get the provincial premiers to agree on a constitutional amendment formula, Trudeau announced that he was taking unilateral action on a \"people's package\" to patriate the constitution and entrench it with a charter of rights. He was challenged by three provinces in the Canadian supreme court, who all used provincial diplomats in London to lobby British backbenchers.</p> <p>In September 1981, the supreme court decided that although Trudeau's initiative was constitutionally legitimate, it betrayed conventions which held that the majority of premiers should agree to constitutional amendments. On November 5 1981, 16 years to the day that Trudeau was first elected to parliament, the federal government and nine provinces came to a patriation deal that Quebec would not sign.</p> <p>Aboriginal leaders were livid, claiming that their contract with the Crown had been negated. But the process for patriating Canada's constitution, complete with a charter of rights and a clause allowing governments to opt out of certain sections for five years at a time, went ahead in Westminster. On April 17 1982, in pouring rain, the Queen and Trudeau signed the proclamation of a new Canadian constitution and the Quebec government was bound by a charter it loathed.</p> <p>In many senses, Trudeau had won his battle against Quebec nationalism. He had overseen the creation of a charter that will have a lasting impact on Canadian jurisprudence, but he had not managed to create the pan-Canadian nation-building instrument that would fully clarify the relationship between all Canadians and the federal state.</p> <p>Two years later, he left office and found a perch in a Montreal law firm. He raised his sons, produced a self-justifying memoire, canoed his heart out and fathered a daughter by the constitutional lawyer, Deborah Coyne. He read lots, wrote less and travelled more.</p> <p>He re-emerged in full force in 1987 and 1991 to speak out against new constitutional proposals to recognise Quebec as a distinct society, a stance that won him some respect in western Canada, but rekindled nationalist loathing in Quebec. Indeed, in October 1995, when Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien staged a desperate, mass-Canadian rally in Montreal to save Canada from its closest call ever in the second Quebec referendum, Trudeau, the man who had championed federalism all his life, was asked to stay away.</p> <p>He kept custody of his three sons Justin, Sacha, and Michel after his separation and later divorce. Michel died in a skiing accident in 1998. His other two sons and daughter survive him.</p> <p><b> Annis May Timpson</b></p> <p>Joseph Phillippe Pierre Yves Elliot Trudeau, politician, born October 18 1919; died September 28 2000</p>",

      "body": "<p>Last Saturday afternoon, I was picking my way down the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, taking in the view of the city wall and the Dome of the Rock, when one of my companions pointed out that in the Jewish cemetery to our left lay the body of Robert Maxwell. I had forgotten that Maxwell had been buried there after his mysterious death almost nine years ago, after which Israel had given him a sendoff worthy of a king, with a lying-in-state at which the then president, Chaim Herzog, noted Maxwell's \"significant involvement\" in the country's struggle \"for economic independence, for the absorption of the Russian immigration, for the security of our country, and for the achievement of peace\". </p> <p>At the funeral itself, where the vast corpse of this preposterous man lay wrapped in a prayer shawl, the eulogies continued: the then leader of the Israeli Labour Party, Shimon Peres, said, \"In those waters he lost his breath but not his soul. It will float above the waves as a marker to anyone believing that a man can be bigger than the cards he was dealt.\" The enormity of Maxwell's financial wrongdoing had not then been exposed, but even now there is little embarrassment in Israel about its unqualified admiration of him. His enduring status as a Jewish hero is symptomatic of the Israeli tendency to regard selflessness in service to the Jewish state (a quality that Maxwell undoubtedly had) as a virtue compelling forgiveness of most other sins. </p> <p>At the Anglo-Israel Colloquium on The Role of the Media in the Information Age, an event for which I had been invited to Israel, there were gasps among the British participants when Tommy Lapid, a member of the Knesset and a celebrated television pundit, said that when he had been editor of the daily newspaper, Ma'ariv, under Maxwell's ownership, he had suffered no proprietorial interference. If true, this is further evidence of Maxwell's application of different standards towards Britain and Israel - his treatment of the Mirror was not so much interference as rape. </p> <p>The Anglo-Israel Association, which organised the colloquium, is a fairly new institution, but it deserves a bright future. Last weekend's event brought together an impressive collection of media and political big shots from both countries under the amiable joint chairmanship of John Tusa, the former BBC broadcaster who now runs the Barbican Centre in London, and Lord Samuel, grandson of the first British High Commissioner in Palestine after the first world war and professor emeritus of chemistry at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

      "bodyText": "Last Saturday afternoon, I was picking my way down the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, taking in the view of the city wall and the Dome of the Rock, when one of my companions pointed out that in the Jewish cemetery to our left lay the body of Robert Maxwell. I had forgotten that Maxwell had been buried there after his mysterious death almost nine years ago, after which Israel had given him a sendoff worthy of a king, with a lying-in-state at which the then president, Chaim Herzog, noted Maxwell's \"significant involvement\" in the country's struggle \"for economic independence, for the absorption of the Russian immigration, for the security of our country, and for the achievement of peace\". At the funeral itself, where the vast corpse of this preposterous man lay wrapped in a prayer shawl, the eulogies continued: the then leader of the Israeli Labour Party, Shimon Peres, said, \"In those waters he lost his breath but not his soul. It will float above the waves as a marker to anyone believing that a man can be bigger than the cards he was dealt.\" The enormity of Maxwell's financial wrongdoing had not then been exposed, but even now there is little embarrassment in Israel about its unqualified admiration of him. His enduring status as a Jewish hero is symptomatic of the Israeli tendency to regard selflessness in service to the Jewish state (a quality that Maxwell undoubtedly had) as a virtue compelling forgiveness of most other sins. At the Anglo-Israel Colloquium on The Role of the Media in the Information Age, an event for which I had been invited to Israel, there were gasps among the British participants when Tommy Lapid, a member of the Knesset and a celebrated television pundit, said that when he had been editor of the daily newspaper, Ma'ariv, under Maxwell's ownership, he had suffered no proprietorial interference. If true, this is further evidence of Maxwell's application of different standards towards Britain and Israel - his treatment of the Mirror was not so much interference as rape. The Anglo-Israel Association, which organised the colloquium, is a fairly new institution, but it deserves a bright future. Last weekend's event brought together an impressive collection of media and political big shots from both countries under the amiable joint chairmanship of John Tusa, the former BBC broadcaster who now runs the Barbican Centre in London, and Lord Samuel, grandson of the first British High Commissioner in Palestine after the first world war and professor emeritus of chemistry at the Weizmann Institute of Science. (He also studied chemistry with Margaret Thatcher at Oxford, where he found her very mousy and lacking in confidence.) One could say, I suppose, that the Israeli delegates were not wholly representative of their country, for many of them were of British birth and education, while many British delegates were Jewish.

If one is of a conspiracist set of mind, one might imagine that Paula had been sleeping with the president (sorry, prime minister), perhaps - as her great heroine Marilyn Monroe had done in her day - and that, when she threatened, in a last desperate midnight phone call to make their affair public, MI5 was sent in to do their stuff with a vodka bottle and a hypodermic. Just in time for the party conference. </p> <p>What's that, you say? It's a load of old codswallop? Well, yes, if you want to nitpick. But it's certainly no more ludicrous than the rest of the swill that has been written about this woman since her death. The one truly alarming thing that Yates's death did reveal to me was not about the madness of modern society, but rather about the silliness of serious newspapers. It revealed, rather shockingly, that the broadsheet press is now home to even more Sob Sisters than the traditionally mocked tabloids. </p> <p>Come on down, Muriel, Justine, Jane, Deborah, Yvonne. The byline was different, but the sob remained the same: Paula Yates Died For Our Sins; Paula Yates, Innocent Victim Of A Feeding-Frenzied Media; Tragic Paula, Broken Butterfly On The Wheel Of Misogyny. Paula, We Hardly Knew You! What Are We Doing? What Does It Mean? Where Are We Going? Where Have We Been? What's It All About, Alfie! Muriel Gray, who I can only hope has since been sedated, went so far as to write of Yates that she was the most powerful British female role model of our age - a role model, in a country that contains Barbara Castle, Dr Sheila Cassidy and Kate Moss. A role model whose currency was blowjobs and breast enhancement. In the words of the great Jim Royle: Arse. </p> <p>I'll put my cards on the table here. I met Paula when we were both 17, and we loathed each other from the word go. I came back to my desk at the NME one afternoon, and she was sitting on it, legs wide apart, no knickers, screeching at the top of her voice about sex. I was, without doubt, a stuck-up little madam, but I'd never seen anything so gross in my life. </p> <p>I've read many times since that Paula was a part of \"the London punk scene\", but this wasn't true at all; she never went to the Roxy or the Vortex, and she didn't know any of the groups - the Clash, Sex Pistols, the Jam or even, God help her, the Damned. I actually knew the groupies of the time, and they were intelligent, hard-working young women of working-class extraction, with names such as Sue and Tracey and Debbie, who were (and punk was unique in this, as far as I know) respected by the bands as mates and equals who just happened to get a lot of shagging done. None of these girls would have dreamed of giving any musician a blowjob 20 minutes after meeting him (and especially not Bob Geldof - Jesus!); that was sad, tacky, 60s free-love shit. </p> <p>Touchingly, Paula couldn't even be a groupie properly. She was too needy, too clammy. No wonder the other Boomtown Rats called her \"The Limpet\"; as Queen Groupie titles go, it's hardly \"The Mouth\" or \"Platinum Pussy\", is it? </p> <p>She envied me my cred; I envied her her confidence. We never stopped loathing each other. Our last point of contact was when a mutual friend tried to make peace, and she spat at him, \"Don't talk about that woman to me, because it's like talking to the Jews about Hitler\" - a remark, it must be said, that in its sheer self-importance and tastelessness was typical of Paula. Nevertheless, our lives ran parallel. We both got married at 19 to stroppy, bossy horrors, and had children. In 1995, we both left our husbands for rather more exciting young lovers. I remember being in bed with my girlfriend at Blakes Hotel when I heard that Paula and Michael Hutchence had just been ambushed by the paparazzi coming out of a hotel - not as classy a one as Blakes, though - a few streets away; I remember feeling really clever that I was \"invisible\", and that I could commit adultery without paying the price of public ridicule and reprimand. Eight weeks later, my lady love and I were splashed all over the tabloid press and my mother was crying inconsolably down the phone, on top of nursing my dad through the cancer that would soon kill him. Served me right. </p> <p>We both lost custody of our children to bitter, self-righteous men, and suffered further media bullying about our suitability as mothers. We both took up with younger men, though mine turned out to be a total gem and hers turned out to be a parade of junkies, jokes and kiss-and-sellers. We both bought houses by the seaside, but, whereas I turned my back on London, Paula hung on in there, falling out of her dress at pap-infested parties and premieres. Keeping one foot in this arena meant, inevitably, that Paula would fret about her fading beauty, which was not a problem for me. Though I was a beautiful young woman, my looks were only ever the icing on the cake - writing was what really mattered. A good writer, when she could be bothered, Paula neglected her craft in favour of frocks and famous men; she expected to have an easy ride through life because she was blonde and fluffy. </p> <p> For a reputedly smart woman, why didn't she realise that being blonde and fluffy is no basis on which to build a life, and that Baby Doll turns to Baby Jane pretty damned quick if held a beat too long? F Scott Fitzgerald wrote of poor mad, dead Zelda, \"Too late, she realised that work is the only dignity.\" Paula, with her fantasies of being a perfect 50s homemaker, never realised this. </p> <p>No doubt having learned from our initial rejection and belated recognition of Monroe as a comrade in the sex war, we are always ready to claim any woman as a \"sister\" when she dies young. But there is a happy medium between being catty and being over-emotional. Paula was not Marilyn, and she was certainly not the Princess of Wales; she had no resonance or significance for society as a whole, just to the people who loved her, which was surely enough. Let her be remembered, then, as a person, and by those who knew her; not as a symbol, a syndrome or a modern malaise by the Sob Sisters, however sympathetic, who didn't. Let her go.</p>",

The law there says that it is not enough to be truthful when testifying in court, you have to be logical too; for you commit perjury not only if you make a statement under oath which, as the statute has it, you either know to be false or which you do not believe to be true - a nice distinction - but also if you make two or more statements which are inconsistent with each other to such an extent that at least one of them has to be false. Since almost all of us hold inconsistent beliefs, we would do well to say as little as possible if we find ourselves in an Indiana witness stand. </p> <p>The actual wording of Indiana's perjury statute is that statements have to be \"inconsistent to the degree that one of them is necessarily false,\" which in enjoining logic on the populace by law, is itself illogical - not in the sense that it is illogical to wish people to be logical, however hopeless an ambition that may be, but rather in the sense that the statute itself, on a literal reading, is illogical. And even on a generous reading it requires far too much. </p> <p>The problem is loose wording, a fault that drafters of legal instruments are usually keen to avoid. The statute should require that statements are inconsistent to the degree that they cannot be true together, but it cannot require that whichever of them is false should be a \"necessary falsehood.\" In the strict technical sense of logic, a statement is necessarily false when it cannot possibly be true - when, in short, it is self-contradictory. But both members of an inconsistent pair of statements can be self-consistent, in the sense that their respective truth and falsity could have been the other way round if the world had been different. </p> <p>This is what distinguishes a commonplace falsehood from a necessary one; the latter cannot be true under any circumstances. The mere fact that one statement is inconsistent with another is no guarantee that either of them is necessarily false in this sense. And it is too lenient on perjurers to indict them for contradictions only. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the intention of the Indiana statute is clear, and it captures the aim of perjury laws everywhere. Perjury is a serious crime because it directly undermines the purpose of proceedings at law, which is to do justice. Justice cannot be done unless the parties to a case provide the court with statements they sincerely believe to be true, and which convey all the relevant information in their possession. Since the very possibility of justice depends on this, all jurisdictions are severe in their punishment of perjury when they detect it. </p> <p>Naturally enough perjury is committed all the time, usually because someone wishes to save his skin, but occasionally in hopes of serving a greater good.

A party to a proceedings swears to the court, either on the Bible or by affirmation, to tell the truth. Taking an oath is no light matter; it is an undertaking to play a responsible part in the serious business of getting jus tice done. Membership of society carries with it a tacit commitment to play a responsible part in general, but the deliberate and public avowal of that pledge in court is a special act, and perjury is the perversion of it. </p> <p>Optimistically, the law assumes that there is such a thing as truth, and that any individual can tell all of it, not only with no trace of falsehood tainting it, but without any admixture of mere probability or surmise. But the delicate question of whether truth exists, or is attainable, is in this sphere not the point.

      "body": "<p>Last week, my colleague Francis Wheen found a book of parliamentary sketches, published in 1871, and he kindly gave it to me. They're a little like modern political sketches, being a series of longish essays about different aspects of Commons life, written not by a hack but by an anonymous and irascible Tory MP who called himself \"A Silent Member\". </p> <p>I doubt if any paper would publish them today. He includes large chunks of Latin, assuming that all his readers would easily translate. One of the debates he describes is the second reading of the Irish Coercion Bill, which is at least honest, though not a title a modern spin doctor might suggest. The Commons was evidently much rowdier then than now, and when they didn't want to hear someone, they simply howled him down with the mysterious cry of \"Sw-e-e-e-p!\" </p> <p>Then there are lines like this, in an otherwise admiring profile of Disraeli: \"Somehow Englishmen have never yet been able to give their confidence to any one who bears the unmistakeable traces of Jewish origins ... had he been of British descent, like his lifelong rival Mr Gladstone, everything would have been forgiven.\" </p> <p>But there are also rather sharp analyses of the state of the Conservative party. Then as now they had suffered a humiliating defeat at the polls, and the Liberals had a majority of 126. Then as now it was a time of bewildering technological change; the penny post, the email of its day, had come in only 31 years before. \"In these days of sudden agitation and tumultuous changes, it was evident that themes based upon the past which had no reference to the present must have to submit to reconsideration. The Tory party failed in discerning the signs and the times. Instead of guiding the new current of political thought, they were content to sit still, and oppose and repress it. Vain, weak, unstatesmanlike endeavour! Never could they reach the point proposed. The world would not stand still to please a political party.\" </p> <p>How true that is today, as it was 129 years ago. Of course, nowadays my colleagues and I just fill the sketch with cheap jokes. </p> <p>Normally I dislike Fords. They're naff, and they speak of Little Chefs, coathooks and Lisa Stansfield cassettes. But as I walked past a couple of tiny vehicles along Brighton front yesterday, a Ford rep leaped out at me and asked if I'd like to test drive their new electric car. It has only two seats, though plenty of luggage space, it looks and sounds like an armoured milk float, but it was amazingly nippy, and we charged up and down the prom very easily and agreeably. </p> <p>It does seem quite pricey - apparently when and if it goes on sale it'll probably cost \u00a310,000 - but the amazing sales point is that it can go 55 miles on a single battery charge, which will cost around 50p at night rates. And, best of all, it's the kind of car that would cause Jeremy Clarkson to fall down in a whimpering, mewling conniption. </p> <p>Of course, even Ford cars aren't quite as naff as the Labour party conference these days. They have a theme song, a particularly loud and boomy version of the Canned Heat hit Let's Work Together. This is played before the start of every session, and when - as with the prime minister - the session starts half an hour late it is simply repeated over and over again, so giving the delegates the authentic horrible feeling of what it must be like to work in a discount jeans store on Oxford Street. </p> <p>I learned of a startling scene this week. A chap I know found himself in the royal box for the men's singles final at Wimbledon; the reasons for his presence are too complicated to describe. The royals in the box that day were the Kents and, as he put it, \"that one with the non-existent chin and his wife,\" whom I take to be the Gloucesters. If you recall, the rain poured down for most of the afternoon and it added greatly to my friend's annoyance that the royals were the only people in the box who had access to alcoholic refreshment. </p> <p>But then, to his astonishment, they commanded a flunkey to go out and buy a Monopoly set. I wouldn't know where to find one in Wimbledon on a Sunday afternoon, but he managed it, and they began a particularly acrimonious game, starting with a row about who got which playing pieces. </p> <p>It is a marvellous thought: \"No, you have the Mayfair card, but I actually own Mayfair...\" or \"Goody, I've got a complete set and I can put a palace on the Old Kent Road.\" At this point my friend discovered there was a bar on the other side of the court, and left them to their game. \"It topped up my Republican principles very nicely,\" he told me. </p> <p>Now that the Pope has asked Pepsi-Cola to \"help deliver his message to the world\" there seems no limit to the power and penetration of corporate sponsorship. It can lead to embarrassment. Third World charities, for example, loathe Nestl\u00e9, which sells expensive, unnecessary baby formula to mothers who would be much better off in every way if they breast fed their babies. As does Cherie Blair, who is a keen supporter of the Kids' Club Network, which is in turn sponsored by Nestl\u00e9. To the charities, it's as bizarre and unacceptable as an organic food chain taking a donation from Monsanto. </p> <p>Delia Smith's onslaught on other TV chefs this week was marvellous. When I see her programme - \"Here's a kettle I boiled earlier\" - I sense that nothing could ruffle that round, solid, middle-aged, middle-class demeanour. I used to imagine what it would be like to go to a dinner party at her house. After the jokey inquiry, \"Is this a Delia then?\" as the grey mullet in cranberry sauce arrived, there would be eager, polite but ultimately flagging conversation about Norwich's hopes for promotion. </p> <p>After this week's amazing outburst (\"Dreadful, just repulsive,\" of Anthony Worrall Thompson, and \"Yuk!\" about Michael Barry) we now know that can't be the case. It would be effing and blinding all night. There must be yards of BBC film showing what happens when she drops an egg on her foot, or a souffl\u00e9 fails to rise. </p> <p>\"Now this is the whisk I like best. I put it into the cream and sugar mixture, and, oh, no, for crying out loud, Jesus H. Christ, f***, f***, f*** f***ing a***holes...\" At Christmas we would be able to buy tapes called \"Delia, Live and Uncut\" - rated 18, with a sticker saying: \"Warning, contents may offend.\"</p>",

It is supported by extra permanent staff in the area - they can no longer be counted on the fingers of one hand - the first increase since the paper moved its editorial headquarters from Manchester to London in 1964 (it had dropped Manchester from its title, by the way, almost five years earlier). </p> <p>In recent years the staff journalists based in the region, vigorous though they are, have been crying out for help. One told me, not all that long ago, that they moved around a lot to give the impression there were more of them. They, like many readers, felt there was a metropolitan bias in the paper to a degree that was alienating if not actually offensive, damaging both to their efforts and to the paper's circulation. Although the bias was perhaps no worse than might be detected in other broadsheets, better was expected from the Guardian because of its origins. </p> <p>Guardian North has already met with what is being seen inside the paper as a modest but encouraging success. The circulation in the area covered by it has gone up, and there has been a marked improvement in coverage all round, but perhaps most conspicuously in sport and the arts. </p> <p>On the first night there was an unprecedented number of changes (21 in all) to sports pages to give a stronger emphasis to football matches involving northern clubs, including Manchester United and Leeds United. There will also be greater scope now for enhanced rugby league coverage, something that many readers have been demanding. </p> <p>The improvement in arts coverage in the region is part of a general improvement affecting all readers, brought about by the release of more space on what was the Miscellany page of the main paper. The cartoon strips and the country diary have been moved, the weather (to some protest) has lost a very small amount of space, and the page now renamed \"Reviews\" can, with edition changes, carry up to 3,000 words of theatre, music and art reviews every day. Reviews of events anywhere in the country, including the north, that seem to argue their case strongly enough will run through all editions. </p> <p>There has been a certain amount of dissenting or sceptical mail, some of which we published on the Letters page on September 19. I have read all the unpublished correspondence sent to the northern editor. The main anxiety was summed up by one writer like this: \"I buy what I had thought was a national newspaper to get a wide perspective ... If I wanted to buy a parochial newspaper I would do so.\" Henry David Thoreau made the same point in his book Walden, nearly 150 years ago, \"Why should our life be in any respect provincial? If we will read newspapers, why not skip the gossip of Boston and take the best newspaper in the world at once?\" </p> <p>I read this to the editor of the paper when we were discussing the reaction to Guardian North. He said: \"I keep on saying that it is not a local paper, but at the same time there are matters of regional importance that may not be of national importance.\" It was a question of emphasis. By revitalising the news operation, more stories of particular significance to the north should run nationwide. It had already had that effect. </p> <p>The Guardian is in the process of setting up an archive (more about that on another occasion) and I asked the editor whether his involvement in this project had been influential. He said it was impossible to read about the history of the paper without being struck again by the strength of its roots in Manchester, and perhaps that had had some effect. But there were other factors. </p> <p>He drew attention to the debate that has been going on, particularly in the US, asking whether newspapers had become too distant from the communities they were supposed to serve. One writer, James Fallows, in his book Breaking the News (Pantheon), had urged journalists to consider the part they were playing in creating a mood of \"fatalistic disengagement\" among people who felt cynical about politics and increasingly so about newspapers. </p> <p>Those who feel that there is something patronising in this development will perhaps let us know what their thoughts are when Guardian North has been sustained for a bit longer.

      "body": "<p>Copernicus would have been impressed, or that bloke with the metal nose. Watching this week's soaps was like scanning the heavens, as huge spherical bodies circled each other or collided with a crash that would wipe out dinosaurs. </p> <p>Leading this astral dance, of course, were Frank and Pat in <strong> EastEnders</strong> (BBC1), he looming large in noisy jumpers and she in even louder blouses. They were clearly created for each other. They are, unfortunately, married to completely different people. </p> <p>Frank's smouldering passion for Pat has recently been rekindled, and he is now panting after her with his ears swinging and his tongue hanging out. She escapes as fast as her earrings permit. It is like the worst excesses of Tosca. </p> <p>This week Frank used a cunning plan patented by King David: send the husband to Manchester to sell dodgy motors. While he is mired in this desperate endeavour, his wife will be easy prey. Pat, however, is made of sterner stuff, and plenty of it. With a toasting fork and a hard hat, she could go on as Britannia without rehearsal, and she rebuffs his blandishments: \"I wouldn't have you if you came gift-wrapped in your birthday suit with a revolving bow tie!\" </p> <p>Frank's response on Tuesday was fast and full frontal. The camera, of course, has to stop just above the watershed. </p> <p>Meanwhile in <strong> Emmerdale </strong> (ITV), Paddy, the cuddly vet, is on his way to collect his abundant wife, Mandy, who has been looking after her sick dad in Southampton (which is often used as Siberia in northern soaps.) Mandy, or most of her, is found wrapped in the arms of a nurse called Neil. A cheering feature in this sad affair is Mandy's dad. Caleb is an aged nuisance who sees the world from the standpoint of the sun. Clutching his chest in an implausible fashion, he whined: \"They went out last night, made me tea, swanned off into town and that's the last I saw of them. I 'aven't 'ad a cup of tea since dinner. Anything could have 'appened to me with them lot being gone all that time. I could peg it any minute. I could be laid dying on me bed and she Would Not 'Ave A Clue.\" </p> <p>When the air is filled with the sound of breaking hearts and bow ties, Caleb reminds us that, eventually, being able to find your teeth in the morning will be happiness enough for one day. </p> <p>Dylan Moran's superbly funny and laid-back performance in <strong> How Do You Want Me?</strong> (being deservedly repeated on BBC 2) made you sit up. He is now in another comedy, <strong> Black Books</strong> (Channel 4), and you can sit down again. </p> <p>This time he is a savagely misanthropic bookshop owner with a sweet-natured assistant, played by Bill Bailey. (The spidery shadow of Basil Fawlty falls over this idea.) I found this slightly surreal series offered one helpless yelp of laughter per episode. In the first show it is the welcome arrival of Jehovah's Witnesses, as Moran is vainly trying to fill in his tax return. \"Hello! Great! Come in! I'd love to hear about Jesus. What's he doing now?\" The eyes of the Witness rolled white, like a horse being offered an unexpected trip to France. </p> <p>I wonder if, by any chance, they have got the casting the wrong way round. Bill Bailey, who is very good indeed, is potentially the more terrifying of the two, while Dylan Moran can do endearing lying down. God knows where the girl-next-door is supposed to fit in. Good sitcoms are usually about lifers, shackled together by celibacy, poverty, family, necessity, history, somethingy. What chain gang are these three in? </p> <p>\"I have argued quite eloquently,\" concluded Jonathan Ross on Room 101 (BBC2), pausing at last for breath, as even blue whales must. \"You haven't stopped talking,\" said Paul Merton. \"That's not the same.\" Discuss eloquently or at length.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Copernicus would have been impressed, or that bloke with the metal nose. Watching this week's soaps was like scanning the heavens, as huge spherical bodies circled each other or collided with a crash that would wipe out dinosaurs. Leading this astral dance, of course, were Frank and Pat in EastEnders (BBC1), he looming large in noisy jumpers and she in even louder blouses. They were clearly created for each other. They are, unfortunately, married to completely different people. Frank's smouldering passion for Pat has recently been rekindled, and he is now panting after her with his ears swinging and his tongue hanging out. She escapes as fast as her earrings permit. It is like the worst excesses of Tosca. This week Frank used a cunning plan patented by King David: send the husband to Manchester to sell dodgy motors. While he is mired in this desperate endeavour, his wife will be easy prey. Pat, however, is made of sterner stuff, and plenty of it. With a toasting fork and a hard hat, she could go on as Britannia without rehearsal, and she rebuffs his blandishments: \"I wouldn't have you if you came gift-wrapped in your birthday suit with a revolving bow tie!\" Frank's response on Tuesday was fast and full frontal. The camera, of course, has to stop just above the watershed. Meanwhile in Emmerdale (ITV), Paddy, the cuddly vet, is on his way to collect his abundant wife, Mandy, who has been looking after her sick dad in Southampton (which is often used as Siberia in northern soaps.) Mandy, or most of her, is found wrapped in the arms of a nurse called Neil. A cheering feature in this sad affair is Mandy's dad. Caleb is an aged nuisance who sees the world from the standpoint of the sun. Clutching his chest in an implausible fashion, he whined: \"They went out last night, made me tea, swanned off into town and that's the last I saw of them. I 'aven't 'ad a cup of tea since dinner. Anything could have 'appened to me with them lot being gone all that time. I could peg it any minute. I could be laid dying on me bed and she Would Not 'Ave A Clue.\" When the air is filled with the sound of breaking hearts and bow ties, Caleb reminds us that, eventually, being able to find your teeth in the morning will be happiness enough for one day. Dylan Moran's superbly funny and laid-back performance in How Do You Want Me? (being deservedly repeated on BBC 2) made you sit up. He is now in another comedy, Black Books (Channel 4), and you can sit down again. This time he is a savagely misanthropic bookshop owner with a sweet-natured assistant, played by Bill Bailey. (The spidery shadow of Basil Fawlty falls over this idea.) I found this slightly surreal series offered one helpless yelp of laughter per episode. In the first show it is the welcome arrival of Jehovah's Witnesses, as Moran is vainly trying to fill in his tax return. \"Hello! Great! Come in! I'd love to hear about Jesus. What's he doing now?\" The eyes of the Witness rolled white, like a horse being offered an unexpected trip to France. I wonder if, by any chance, they have got the casting the wrong way round. Bill Bailey, who is very good indeed, is potentially the more terrifying of the two, while Dylan Moran can do endearing lying down. God knows where the girl-next-door is supposed to fit in. Good sitcoms are usually about lifers, shackled together by celibacy, poverty, family, necessity, history, somethingy. What chain gang are these three in? \"I have argued quite eloquently,\" concluded Jonathan Ross on Room 101 (BBC2), pausing at last for breath, as even blue whales must. \"You haven't stopped talking,\" said Paul Merton. \"That's not the same.\" Discuss eloquently or at length.",

A small group of largely middle-aged men were hovering outside the building with headphones clamped to their ears, unsure whether to go in and watch the Kirov Opera's Mazeppa. I know because I was one of them. The dilemma was that Dominic Cork and Darren Gough were slowly inching England towards an umbrella-chewing victory over the West Indies at Lords as the curtain was due to rise. If ever you wanted proof that sport can be as suspenseful as anything the stage has to offer, this was it. </p> <p>Sport is theatre. What is striking, however, is how rarely theatre acknowledges sport. A couple of exceptions this week only proved the rule. The Beautiful Game, the new Lloyd Webber-Ben Elton musical, captures both the fluent rhythms and fanatacism associated with soccer. And the turning point in Julian Mitchell's Another Country comes when the flannelled hero despatches a love note to a junior boy while awaiting his turn to bat. But, on the whole, theatre and sport are rare bedfellows, which is odd when you think that drugs, race, sex and money dominate the back pages of our papers. </p> <p>Obviously sport is hard to represent theatrically. But it offers a vivid social metaphor, as one or two dramatists have cannily realised. The best sporting play of recent years is David Storey's The Changing Room, in which you never actually see a ball kicked in anger. What Storey shows us are the rituals surrounding a Rugby League game: the daubing of frozen bodies in oils and embrocations, the injury to a fading, over-the-hill forward, the wan, post-match celebrations as these muscular heroes prepare to re-enter the outside world. But it is the visit by the club chairman, all banal encouragement and paunchy patronage, that characterises the play as a sharp example of sport as a metaphor for class. </p> <p>That was 1971, and both life and Rugby League have radically changed since: only this week I read of the Leeds coach facing an industrial tribunal because one of his players had accused him of racial discrimination. But, although we are now into the age of Super Leagues and TV contracts, the game exerts a strong spell over northern dramatists. John Godber's most famous play remains Up'n'Under, in which he actually puts a Rugby League Sevens match on stage and shows an amateur pub team almost triumphing over their mighty Castleford opponents. The thrill comes not just from seeing sport in action but from Godber's ability to use Rugby League as a metaphor for male machismo. </p> <p>But few dramatists have realised that sport is both central to our culture and an expression of our confusions about race, money, individualism and society. It is fun to list some of the exceptions. Soccer stars in Peter Terson's Zigger Zagger and David Farr's Elton John's Glasses, which had the misfortune to open at the height of the 1998 World Cup. Athletics is the subject of Louise Page's Golden Girls, which gives the lie to the idea that sport is a peculiarly male obsession. Cricket is the starting point for Richard Harris's Outside Edge, which explores the marital pain beyond the boundary: a play that Frank Keating wittily described as \"Ayckbourn off a shorter run\". </p> <p>But Ayckbourn is the only modern British dramatist who has consistently realised sport's dramatic potential. He obviously relishes the technical challenge of playing theatrical games. More crucially, he understands that sport, even at its most humdrum level, is a revelation of character. In Time and Time Again, the under-achieving Leonard pinches a sports fanatic's girl while cluelessly fielding on the boundary. Tennis is brilliantly used in Joking Apart, where the effortlessly gifted Richard contrives to lose to his Swedish business partner by playing left-handed. \"At least,\" cries the humiliated Sven, \"you paid me the compliment of not hopping on one leg as well.\" And in A Game of Golf, part of the multiple-choice Intimate Exchanges, we are reminded that other things than balls sometimes get lost in a bunker. </p> <p>Sport is central to Ayckbourn: in other dramatists, it has a more subterranean influence. Cricket is the abiding passion of all the best dramatists and subtly affects their work. Beckett, the only Nobel prize-winner to appear in Wisden, loved the game's formalised rituals. Pinter once spoke of cricket's \"hidden violence\" and in No Man's Land significantly names his characters after four pre-1914 legends. The most eloquent speech in Stoppard's The Real Thing comes when the writer-hero describes how, at its best, prose can fly in the same way as a ball off a bat. The one writer to have made cricket his sole subject was Rattigan in his none-too-brilliant film The Final Test: even given the English selectors' penchant for experience, it beggars belief to see the 58-year-old Jack Warner going out to face the Australian quickies on an Oval snorter. </p> <p>When you tot it up, it sounds as if British drama is a steady procession of muddied oafs and flannelled fools, and I haven't even begun on American works such as Golden Boy (boxing), That Championship Season (basketball) or Damn Yankees (baseball). But the reality is that hardly any dramatist has woken up to the fact that professional sport is an all-too-accurate reflection of society at large. Sport, partly because of the Murdochisation of the media, is currently big business in Britain. That, in itself, introduces all kinds of new conflicts: between star performers and managers, between traditional values and the win-at-all-costs ethos, between natural achievement and drug-enhanced performance. </p> <p>You can even argue that sport itself has become a dangerous national opiate used to distract us from the problems of the real world: Olympic medallists, in most papers, get more headlines than Yugoslav elections. You may hate sport. What you can't do is ignore it. Which is why, for all the virtues of Storey, Godber and Ayckbourn, one impatiently awaits a British play that recognises sport has passed way beyond a Saturday recreation or an enjoyable part of life and has become both a ruthless capitalist business and a source of dreams for a muddled, insecure nation. </p> <p>\u0095 The Beautiful Game is at the Cambridge Theatre, London WC2 (020 7494 5080). Another Country is at the Arts Theatre, London WC2 (020 7836 3334).</p>",

Tennis is brilliantly used in Joking Apart, where the effortlessly gifted Richard contrives to lose to his Swedish business partner by playing left-handed. \"At least,\" cries the humiliated Sven, \"you paid me the compliment of not hopping on one leg as well.\" And in A Game of Golf, part of the multiple-choice Intimate Exchanges, we are reminded that other things than balls sometimes get lost in a bunker. Sport is central to Ayckbourn: in other dramatists, it has a more subterranean influence. Cricket is the abiding passion of all the best dramatists and subtly affects their work. Beckett, the only Nobel prize-winner to appear in Wisden, loved the game's formalised rituals. Pinter once spoke of cricket's \"hidden violence\" and in No Man's Land significantly names his characters after four pre-1914 legends. The most eloquent speech in Stoppard's The Real Thing comes when the writer-hero describes how, at its best, prose can fly in the same way as a ball off a bat. The one writer to have made cricket his sole subject was Rattigan in his none-too-brilliant film The Final Test: even given the English selectors' penchant for experience, it beggars belief to see the 58-year-old Jack Warner going out to face the Australian quickies on an Oval snorter. When you tot it up, it sounds as if British drama is a steady procession of muddied oafs and flannelled fools, and I haven't even begun on American works such as Golden Boy (boxing), That Championship Season (basketball) or Damn Yankees (baseball). But the reality is that hardly any dramatist has woken up to the fact that professional sport is an all-too-accurate reflection of society at large. Sport, partly because of the Murdochisation of the media, is currently big business in Britain. That, in itself, introduces all kinds of new conflicts: between star performers and managers, between traditional values and the win-at-all-costs ethos, between natural achievement and drug-enhanced performance. You can even argue that sport itself has become a dangerous national opiate used to distract us from the problems of the real world: Olympic medallists, in most papers, get more headlines than Yugoslav elections. You may hate sport. What you can't do is ignore it. Which is why, for all the virtues of Storey, Godber and Ayckbourn, one impatiently awaits a British play that recognises sport has passed way beyond a Saturday recreation or an enjoyable part of life and has become both a ruthless capitalist business and a source of dreams for a muddled, insecure nation. \u0095 The Beautiful Game is at the Cambridge Theatre, London WC2 (020 7494 5080).

They rise above the lower valley of the River Rother, 200 acres of ancient woodlands of birch and oak, hiding open heathland at the very top. In Victorian times, naturalists travelled to Canklow Woods by coach from Birmingham to collect holly blue butterflies. Sadly, there is little holly or ivy, their larval food plants, now, but the butterflies have returned in recent years.

They rise above the lower valley of the River Rother, 200 acres of ancient woodlands of birch and oak, hiding open heathland at the very top.

Sadly, there is little holly or ivy, their larval food plants, now, but the butterflies have returned in recent years.

      "body": "<p>Saffron and cardamom are two of the great exotics, sought after by princes, potentates, panjandrums and, of course, chefs. Made from the hand-picked stigmas of the purple Crocus sativus, saffron has, not surprisingly, always been of fabulous reputation, equalled only by its price. Cardamom is no less distinguished, however, its various forms being celebrated in the Mahabharata, lusted after by the Romans and celebrated in Chinese poetry.</p> <p>Although neither originated there, both spices come together in the cooking of southern India, where they are used sparingly. Both have powerful flavouring qualities, which, if used in excess, bring out unpleasant, bullying and, in saffron's case, markedly bitter tones. Separately, they have marched through the culinary cultures around the world.</p> <p>The British have had a particular affinity for saffron, perhaps because the crocus actually grew in our climate. The curiously named Saffron Hill in the City of London is so called because it was once part of the gardens of Ely Palace, where saffron was grown, presumably for abstemious bishops. And the arms of Saffron Walden, Essex, bear three saffron flowers, a mark of when it was the centre of saffron production, its heyday being Tudor times. It found its way into a host of dishes, as well as buns and cakes, which is a splendid Cornish tradition that is still very much alive today. In retrospect, however, it seems rather odd that it was never used to bring colour and pizzazz to a stew of the fish that are native to our waters, in much the same way that countries around the Mediterranean have done.</p> <p>As with all spices, you have to treat saffron with respect. I have already noted its bullying tendencies if used with a heavy hand (although they are no worse than the herbs rosemary and sage), which may go some way to explaining why saffron has not always had the best press in these matters. The great herbalist, Nicholas Culpeper, noted that it was a \"useful aromatic, of a strong pungent bitterish taste\", while the French gastronome and writer, Alexandre Dumas, described it as near fatal. However, when it comes to adding the drama of colour to a dish, few spices can match saffron, and its distinctive flavour adds a curious and pleasing note.</p> <p>Because of the laborious nature of its production (and the consequent great cost), there is probably more fake saffron about than any other spice. You can find good quality saffron from Kashmir and Turkey, although the best comes from La Mancha in Spain. Remember that heat and, in particular, light are the enemies of all spices, so buy it only in small quantities (you probably won't be able to afford to do anything else, anyway) when you need it.</p> <p>Cardamom similarly loses its vitality when kept for too long. Pliny was spot on when he said that the green pods are the best, but if you're really picky check that the seeds inside are still sticky - if not, those heady aromas to which the Arab world (and, oddly, Sweden and Finland) is so addicted as a flavouring for coffee will be mere shadows. Likewise, ground cardamom. If you are a serious connoisseur, you will insist on your cardamom being the pale green Alleppey cardamom of Kerala, although it is grown all over southern India, Sri Lanka and Indochina, as well as Tanzania, Guatemala, El Salvador and New Guinea.</p> <p>Cardamom, like saffron, has a complicated history. There was some confusion in ancient days between Amomum cardamomum - or \"false\" or \"bastard\" cardamom, which the Greeks and Romans set great store by - and what was designated Elettaria cardamomum , which we know and love today. Quite how the former or the latter found their way into common usage has been obscured by wars, invasions and other such matters, although by the first century AD, Pliny was able to establish that there were four grades of cardamom, and Andrew Dalby in Dangerous Tastes (British Museum Press, \u00a316.99) gives us a recipe from the \"illustrious Vinidarius\", which puts him in mind of one of Jeeves's pick-me-ups that produced the feeling that \"somebody had touched off a bomb inside the old bean and was strolling down my throat with a lighted torch\".</p> <p>Perhaps it isn't surprising, then, that cardamom is a relative of another potent spice, ginger, and was most probably introduced to India from the east, where it was originally appreciated more for its medicinal qualities - as a decongestant, in particular - than for its culinary ones. Bearing in mind these characteristics, while saffron and cardamom pair happily in rice, whether for stuffing or as an accompaniment, it is as well to remember that with these spices less is definitely more.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> Saffron broth</b> This is a wonderful way of using the broth left over after cooking the chicken below. The delicate liquid is freshened up with some chopped, lightly cooked vegetables and then simmered. A few spoonfuls of an aromatic vinaigrette are added just before serving. <br></p> <p><b> 1.5 litres chicken liquor (from cooking the bird, above) <br> 2 medium courgettes <br> 2 small onions <br> 6 spring onions <br> 1 leek <br> 3 plump, ripe tomatoes <br> 2 tbsp fresh peas (if available) <br> 1 generous pinch saffron <br> 1 clove garlic<br> 1 small handful chopped parsley <br> 1 tbsp chopped coriander leaves <br> 2 tbsp very good olive oil <br> 1 tsp white-wine vinegar <br> Salt and pepper<br></b></p> <p>Wash the vegetables. Top and tail the courgettes, and cut them into small, vaguely square pieces. Peel the onions and leek, and finely chop them. Remove the eye from the tomatoes and finely chop the flesh.</p> <p>Put the strained liquor into a generous pot and bring to the boil, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. Add the onions and courgettes, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer, then, after 10 minutes, add the peas, leek and saffron.</p> <p>For the vinaigrette, trim and thinly slice the spring onions. Chop the herbs and garlic, and place them in a bowl with the spring onions, olive oil and vinegar. After the soup has been simmering for half an hour, stir in the vinaigrette and serve at once.</p> <p><b> Poularde \u00e0 la d'albufera </b> I remember a dish of boned chicken stuffed with saffron rice that I cooked years back, and it has since become an old friend. The original version of the recipe was named after the Mar\u00e9chal Suchet, who was made Duc d'Albufera by a grateful Napoleon, after the general's victories in Spain. It is an elaborate dish that I have simplified somewhat here, though, by removing the truffles and foie gras, I suspect that I have merely made it cheaper. The addition of cardamom is a happy one. Once the dish is prepared, it is elegance itself to serve. <br></p> <p><b> 1 2.5kg top-quality free-range chicken</b></p> <p>For the stuffing</p> <p><b> 2 chicken livers and 1 chicken heart (they should be in a little bag inside the cavity of the bird, along with its giblets) <br> 40g unsalted butter <br> 2 medium onions, peeled and finely chopped <br> 60g white rice <br> 35ml white wine <br> 35ml Noilly Pratt (or other white vermouth) <br> 430ml chicken stock <br> 1 generous pinch saffron <br> 6 cardamom pods, cracked <br> 1 bayleaf <br> Salt and pepper <br> 1 egg<br></b></p> <p>Cut the livers and heart into smallish pieces, then fry in just a little of the butter in a heavy-based pot for 45 seconds or so. Transfer to a plate and melt the rest of the butter in the pot. Fry the onions over a gentle heat until softened. Add the rice and stir for two minutes or so, until it becomes translucent. Pour in the white wine and vermouth, then add the chicken stock, saffron, bayleaf, cardamom and a little pepper. Leave the rice to cook, undisturbed, for 15 minutes, until just done. Add the fried liver and heart, and then gently scrape the whole lot into a large bowl. Carefully stir in the egg, then cover and leave to cool.</p> <p>Meanwhile, carefully make an incision along the centre of the breastbone and cut out the two breasts. With a pair of scissors, cut away the exposed breastplate. Season the inside of the chicken with salt and pepper. Put the cooked rice inside the chicken, pushing it gently into the cavity and up against the backbone. Replace the breasts of the chicken on top of the rice, thereby emulating the bird's original form, and with a trussing needle and thread, sew the breasts back together. Finally, tie the bird in several layers of muslin until completely secure. Place the bird in a very heavy pot along with:</p> <p><b> 2 peeled carrots <br> 2 peeled onions <br> 1 stick celery <br> 1 clove <br> 4 cardamom pods, cracked <br> 1 bayleaf <br> 50ml white wine <br> The breastbones from the bird<br></b></p> <p>Fill the pot with ample water to cover the bird and bring to a simmer. Once bubbling, skim off any foam that rises to the surface, then put a lid on the pot and leave to cook quietly for an hour and a quarter. Turn off the heat, and leave the fowl to sit in the stock for at least half an hour undisturbed.</p> <p>The dish may be served cold or warm (my favourite is when it is just warm). Remove the chicken from the pot and keep covered while making the broth (below). There is a pimenton sauce that goes well with this, but I prefer a generous helping of a\u00efoli (then again, I would), along with some boiled waxy spuds.</p> <p><b> Orange and cardamom parfait </b> A recipe of Josceline Dimbleby's that is very, very good. It is worth mentioning the splendid Sicilian oranges that are about right now, which would be excellent for this ice. <br></p> <p><b> 1 can frozen concentrated orange juice <br> 3 large eggs <br> tsp salt <br> 175g caster sugar <br> 6 cardamom pods <br> 300ml whipping cream<br></b></p> <p>Thaw the orange juice in advance. Whisk the eggs and the salt with an electric beater. In a saucepan, dissolve the sugar in six tablespoons of water, then bring to a boil and leave to bubble away undisturbed for three minutes. Pour the hot syrup over the egg/salt mix, beating continuously, and continue beat until the mixture thickens and increases in volume. Remove the seeds from the cardamom pods and then roughly crush the vacant pods. Add these to the egg mixture, along with the orange slush. Mix well. Whip the cream into soft peaks, then fold it into the mixture.</p> <p>Line a terrine or the like with cling-film, and pour in the mixture. Cover and freeze for at least 12 hours.

      "body": "<p>Surely \u00a32.79 for a cabernet sauvignon has to be some kind of joke, doesn't it? Of course it is. We can smile as we satisfyingly glug, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer can guffaw as he sneaks off with more profit from the wine than any participant in its manufacture, distribution or sale. But this is a Bulgarian wine, so that's all right, then. How long such prices can be maintained now that the Bulgars are inching into the real world (ie, one with no subsidies) is anyone's guess, but as far as Tesco, which sells the wine under the non-vintage Reka Valley label, is concerned, so far so good. And this wine is good, being a solid cabernet with firm, rich tannins of impressive demeanour. It rates 14.5 points (out of 20), and goes splendidly with bangers and mash. </p> <p>Tesco would have you pay 69p more for its own-label Fitou, from which you get a mite more in the fruit department. The wine has charm and character, and the cherry-rich jamminess of the fruit is well-controlled, putting up with no unruliness from the earthy tannins. It rates 14.5 points and costs \u00a33.48. </p> <p>With the Chilean Santa Catalina Merlot 1999 (Tesco, 16 points, \u00a34.49), we enter a somewhat more sumptuous arena. There are fumacious riches here, of the cheroot variety, and the fruit, harnessing this aromatic intensity to great effect, is deep, rich, savoury and broad-shouldered. It is hardly a quaffing wine - it's far too concentrated for that - but with roast meat or spicy vegetable dishes it would be superb. </p> <p> Errazuriz Chardonnay 1999 (16 points, \u00a35.79) is also from Chile, and there is a very distinguished feel to the wine as it courses over the taste buds, proving, if any further proof were really necessary, that Chile makes abundantly toothsome chardonnays with exceptional textures at remarkable prices (notwithstanding the Chancellor's customary rapacity). Domaine Cazal Viel Viognier 1999 (16 points, \u00a35.99) is also a treat, offering subtle apricot fruit, lemon edging and a hint of nuttiness. This is a lovely, elegant wine of some class that compares favourably with more expensive viogniers, a chic Rhne white grape, from Condrieu. </p> <p> Normans Unwooded Chardonnay 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99), from Australia, has utterly gorgeous, buttery, slightly baked richness and depth, but none of that lust-to-be-liked which often makes Aussie chardonnays so over-the-top and unbalanced. Last at Tesco (and Thresher, incidentally), there is, from Argentina, 'Q' Tempranillo 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a37.99). This is what more riojas should be like: energetic, rich, tobacco-tinged, deep, jammy but dry, and full of flavoursome layers of surprises. </p> <p>Now, if one wonders how Tesco achieves some of its prices, what about our friends at the Co-Op? The CWS's Romanian Prairie Merlot 1999 (14.5 points) is down to \u00a32.59 until October 15 and, though no great claims can be made for its complexity, it soothes the tongue and warms the heart. Adiseno Tempranillo 1999 (15 points, \u00a33.99), from Argentina, does all this, too, but also clogs the throat, too, for it's as thick as a wine sauce, and just as meaty and rich. 'Laid Back Ruby' California Ruby Cabernet 1999 (15 points, \u00a33.99) bristles with food-friendly fruit, offering an unusually bravura performance from the much-despised ruby cabernet grapes. </p> <p> Mission Peak Argentine Red (15.5 points, \u00a32.99, also at Booths) has marvellous texture, rich fruit and throbs with pleasure-giving generosity and depth. Mission Peak Argentine White (15.5 points, \u00a32.99) is also a delicious bargain, parading rich yet not obscenely plump fruit, and is marvellous with fish curries. Goiya Kgeisje Chardonnay Sauvignon Blanc 2000 (15 points, \u00a33.99), from South Africa, also likes fish, but not of the spicy sort, since this wine's deft blend of soft fruit and crisp acids - where ogen melon and pineapple/ lemon freshness harmonise so purposefully - is delicately poised, and so simple grilled mackerel with herb butter is perfect. </p> <p>Last, another \u00a32.79 bargain, news of which reached me only as this column was going to press (slapped wrist, Somerfield). This is that retailer's scrumptious own-label Chilean Sauvignon Blanc 1999, which is beautifully compacted with 16-point gooseberry fruit and frisky on the finish. It stays in its lowly state until October 3 only.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The board game, Doley, was invented by Paul Noble, one of the five artists who have won this year's Paul Hamlyn Awards. It is a game \"for three or more players over the age of 16\", who choose to be represented by one of five characters on the board, Oblivious (&amp; Other-worldly), Burnt Out, Formless &amp; Misshapen, Ineffectual, and Aimless. \"You are now a player in Doley,\" explain the rules. \"This is what happens to you. Once every two weeks you sign on and then, a couple of days later, your Giro comes. Sometimes your Giro comes in the second post, which means hanging around, watching the letterbox, waiting for the postman ...\" </p> <p>The postman has brought something much nicer for Noble and the other winners of the Paul Hamlyn Awards, Philippe Bradshaw, Jim Lambie, Hilary Lloyd and Hew Locke. Each of the five has been told that they will receive \u00a330,000, to be paid in three annual instalments of \u00a310,000 - with no strings attached. </p> <p>The Paul Hamlyn Awards are different from any other British art prize. This is no Turner, where one of the nominated artists walks away with the prize and the rest spend the next few years getting over the whole thing. The Paul Hamlyn Awards have previously been given to artists in other fields, including composers and poets, but since 1998 have been dedicated to visual arts (publisher Paul Hamlyn's daughter, Jane Hamlyn, who runs London's Frith Street Gallery, is the guiding force). </p> <p>The aim is to provide artists with a secure income with which to nurture creativity, as well as to reward achievement. This is especially welcome for artists who do not currently make a living wage from their work and so have to supplement it with other forms of employment (or, like Noble, spend years on the dole). The judges consider need as well as merit. </p> <p>For many of us, it is hard to get too tearful about the lot of young artists. British art is rarely out of the papers, the wallet of Charles Saatchi is celebratedly capacious, and if artists have to supplement their income with day jobs, so what? </p> <p>If you went to a museum in New York in the 60s and 70s, the person taking your ticket was probably a famous artist in the making (the monochrome painter Robert Ryman and Jeff Koons both worked as attendants at the Museum of Modern Art), and if you went to the legendary toy shop FAO Schwarz in the early 70s you might have been served by Robert Mapplethorpe. Going back further, in the 50s Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg were able to keep working only because they formed a business designing window displays for Fifth Avenue stores. </p> <p>Artists have been half-bourgeois, half-social outsiders ever since they won independence from traditional systems of aristocratic patronage. Artists earn almost nothing until and unless they become stars, names, figures of a certain perceived significance in contemporary art history. </p> <p>\"To be successful as an artist,\" wrote Andy Warhol with candour, \"you have to have your work shown in a good gallery for the same reason that, say, Dior never sold his originals from a counter in Woolworth's ... If a guy has, say, a few thousand dollars to spend on a painting, he doesn't wander along the street until he sees something lying around that 'amuses' him. He wants to buy something that's going to go up and up in value.\" </p> <p>There is a huge division between the handful of artists whose work is valued in this way and the rest for whom the occasional sale is less about a serious contribution to their income than a sign that they are, after all, an artist rather than a teacher or a decorator. In Britain today, there is a vast culture of making art, but most people who call themselves artists will never make an income from their work - until they were taken up by Jay Jopling's White Cube, for example, Jake and Dinos Chapman, notoriously, were penniless. </p> <p>Artists of the post-YBA generation are particularly skint. The style of new British art has changed, and these neo-conceptual artists, often with a political edge to their work, don't expect ever to sell that much. The Paul Hamlyn Awards are particularly suited to this new climate in the British art scene. But they are also prizes, a recognition of talent, and the five artists who have been rewarded this year include some of the most promising figures around. </p> <p>Philippe Bradshaw makes kinky decorations for the modern home. His art has a decadent, rococo feel, and his affinities for the 18th century were made explicit when he reproduced Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard's cheeky painting, The Swing (1767), in the Wallace Collection, as an image glimpsed in the shiny links of a screen of chains. This piece of chainmail erotica - combining the soft frilly art of Fragonard with a hard, modern material, fragmenting a historical work of art in a field of glimmer and glamour - is typical of the work Bradshaw is doing. </p> <p>Until recently, Bradshaw was, with Andrea Mason, part of a collaborative duo, Andrea + Philippe; they carried out site-specific interventions with a subversively decorative quality, on one occasion glazing abandoned wartime bunkers around the country and offering these desirable residences for sale at a phoney estate agency that they had set up in a gallery off the King's Road. \"This brick-rendered hexagonal pillbox has a flat concrete roof with jutting corners,\" went one parodic estate agent's blurb under a colour photo of a ruined military structure in south Wales. \"It is easily accessible via a brick porch entrance. Inside ... two pairs of pink panties have been casually tossed into the corner.\" </p> <p>Since 1998, however, Bradshaw has been working on his own, and his art has become increasingly sensuous and aesthetically ambitious, offering visions of sexy, voluptuous interiors. He plans to make a chain forest, in which he will project images from the story of Hansel and Gretel, and a chain waterfall with a papier-mch\u00e9 coracle. He says he will use the money to \"establish a secure studio\" and \"invest in a computer and digital editing set-up\". </p> <p>Jim Lambie is a psychedelic nostalgist. In ZOBOP (2000), a work that can be installed in any room, he covers the entire floor in groovy, concentric bands of multicoloured vinyl. The bands of colour vibrate and dance like a poster from Haight Ashbury; orange, magenta, lime green. ZOBOP suggests that changing the world begins at home, with a bit of crazy interior decor. We colour walls, we colour doors - why not floors? Do we leave floors plain (in today's anti- carpeting age) because they make the world feel more solid beneath our feet? If you lived with Lambie's Technicolor floor, would it change anything? </p> <p>Lambie's art looks back to a time when delirium was the tool of revolution and altered states of mind were actively pursued. At the same time, ZOBOP is a formally seductive work of art, evoking abstract painting. Twentieth-century art wanted to disrupt perceptions, destroy preconceptions and open up new Utopian ways of seeing things; Lambie wittily links these high ideals to hippy colours and psychedelic pop. </p> <p>Lambie, who studied at Glasgow School of Art, is one of the growing number of Glasgow-based artists who are making an international impact. Like other artists who work in the city, he combines dreaminess and wit, and his art is hugely engaging. The thing he hopes this award will give him is, he says, \"time\" - to plan and develop new work in an unrushed way. He also plans to get a proper studio. </p> <p>Hilary Lloyd is a Warholian observer of young people, their manners, preoccupations, dress. She makes videos of studied nonchalance, which she shows simply on TV monitors mounted on steel pedestals. There is a joke about sculpture, especially the forgotten art of portrait sculpture, in the way she shows her work. Her videos are portraits; they feature young people not doing much, wasting their time in stupid games, or doing less than that - Monika (2000) tries to build a house of cards; Dawn (1999) just sits in a chair in her lime-green suit. We are invited to study them, to see what we can see about them. </p> <p>Warhol is a specific rather than general source: Lloyd's pieces resemble his Screen Tests, in which an unblinking camera would watch people mercilessly as they tried to be funny or broke down and cried. Lloyd is more collaborative with her subjects, and the method of display makes her work more intimate. The monitors are at average human height, so it's as if we are seeing someone in the room with us. At the same time, it is like coming face to face with an 18th-century statue or portrait bust. </p> <p>Hilary Lloyd is radically different from the video artists who emerged in the early 90s: whereas, say, Douglas Gordon and Steve McQueen are intensely cinematic, she is resolutely small-scale, televisual and deliberately slight. </p> <p>Hew Locke recently created an installation at the Victoria and Albert Museum called Hemmed In II. Bulging, growing, bursting between porphyry pillars in the museum's vast entrance hall, it resembled a building, perhaps a bathhouse, a market or a religious building - it was hard to tell. In its organic clutter, it seemed to be a parody of the rambling V&amp;A itself. Locke's architectural jumble - made of nothing but cut-up cardboard stuck together with glue - was the unconscious of the museum spilling out, and the work of an artist who messes about at the margins of high culture. </p> <p>Born in Edinburgh, Locke went to school in Guyana and has said that when he returned to Britain he felt for the first time that he was seen as \"other\". His response has been to make art that engages with European high art, doing grotesque charcoal and pastel drawings based on Vel\u00e1zquez and Hogarth and, with Hemmed In II, confronting the V&amp;A with its jokey other, at once a celebration and travesty. Next year, he will develop further work in museums with a residency at the Horniman Museum in Forest Hill, south London. He is also developing his long-term plan to build a structure large enough for people to walk into, the Cardboard Palace. </p> <p>Paul Noble is a kitchen visionary, a brilliantly original satirist and producer of vile dreams whose work has almost nothing in common with what we think of as contemporary British art. Noble is a politically-minded artist - he is co-curator of the exhibition Protest And Survive at the Whitechapel Gallery - who communicates a detailed vision of the world through drawings, paintings and other activities. </p> <p>However, it is the drawing project he has been working on since 1995 that is Noble's most impressive achievement to date. He is the planner and administrator of Nobson Newtown, a modern British community that he has mapped out from the Nobslums to the Lidonob to the Nobjobclub. Noble's drawings resemble the work of MC Escher, logically extrapolating basic forms. These forms are the letters of a computer font he has designed - called Nobson. The town has its own history, archaeology and geology; in Introduction To Nobson Newtown, Noble recounts how it was built out of a unique stone found in the Nobhill Downs called Nobrock, which the earliest inhabitants of the area mistook for \"the fossilised remains of God's brains\". </p> <p>In fact, Nobrock consists of language. Every building in the town has what it is written in its fabric; the Nobslums, built in a pit into which raw sewage cascades, are little houses made of letters that together say \"nobslum\". In his latest book, Noble portrays Nobson in ruins - a cross between Milton Keynes and Pompeii. The fact that it is built out of language makes you feel it is full of secret meanings and that real life, too, is written according to a secret language in which history, location and politics determine who we are. </p> <p>Nobson is an image of narcissistic and tyrannical creativity - within the town Noble gives himself The Architect's House (Paul's Palace). Noble says he wants to use his award to complete Nobson Newtown - every building, with its elaborate construction, takes him six months to draw - and the money will be especially welcome as he has been surviving by paying low rent on his studio and living in a squat, but \"this is all due to change\". </p> <p>The British art scene today is full of young artists who say the last thing they want is to be the next Damien Hirst or Tracey Emin. Forget glamour and provocation; say hello to books of theory and the pursuit of idiosyncratic ends. </p> <p>It's an inevitable reaction, repeating the history of the 60s, when the glamour of Pop was rejected by the late 60s generation who turned to conceptual art that rejected the market. Yet it's a tricky business pinpointing precisely what's going on in contemporary British art. One moment, it looks as if art has returned to colour and decoration and all the things conceptual artists are supposed to hate; the next, young artists are all political, dry-as-dust thinkers - the tendency reflected in Intelligence: New British Art 2000 at Tate Britain. </p> <p>The truth is, the best artists around now are developing obscure, even eccentric lines of thought that are not connected to any movement or fashion; Paul Noble is one of these major talents, and if there were a first prize in the Paul Hamlyn Awards it should go to him. The unstarry, unpressured Paul Hamlyn Awards are perfectly suited to this mood, encouraging artists not to worry about anything - except making art </p> <p> <strong> Philippe Bradshaw</strong> born 1965 <br></p> <p> From Lincolnshire.

      "bodyText": "The board game, Doley, was invented by Paul Noble, one of the five artists who have won this year's Paul Hamlyn Awards. It is a game \"for three or more players over the age of 16\", who choose to be represented by one of five characters on the board, Oblivious (&amp; Other-worldly), Burnt Out, Formless &amp; Misshapen, Ineffectual, and Aimless. \"You are now a player in Doley,\" explain the rules. \"This is what happens to you. Once every two weeks you sign on and then, a couple of days later, your Giro comes. Sometimes your Giro comes in the second post, which means hanging around, watching the letterbox, waiting for the postman ...\" The postman has brought something much nicer for Noble and the other winners of the Paul Hamlyn Awards, Philippe Bradshaw, Jim Lambie, Hilary Lloyd and Hew Locke. Each of the five has been told that they will receive \u00a330,000, to be paid in three annual instalments of \u00a310,000 - with no strings attached. The Paul Hamlyn Awards are different from any other British art prize. This is no Turner, where one of the nominated artists walks away with the prize and the rest spend the next few years getting over the whole thing. The Paul Hamlyn Awards have previously been given to artists in other fields, including composers and poets, but since 1998 have been dedicated to visual arts (publisher Paul Hamlyn's daughter, Jane Hamlyn, who runs London's Frith Street Gallery, is the guiding force). The aim is to provide artists with a secure income with which to nurture creativity, as well as to reward achievement. This is especially welcome for artists who do not currently make a living wage from their work and so have to supplement it with other forms of employment (or, like Noble, spend years on the dole). The judges consider need as well as merit. For many of us, it is hard to get too tearful about the lot of young artists. British art is rarely out of the papers, the wallet of Charles Saatchi is celebratedly capacious, and if artists have to supplement their income with day jobs, so what? If you went to a museum in New York in the 60s and 70s, the person taking your ticket was probably a famous artist in the making (the monochrome painter Robert Ryman and Jeff Koons both worked as attendants at the Museum of Modern Art), and if you went to the legendary toy shop FAO Schwarz in the early 70s you might have been served by Robert Mapplethorpe. Going back further, in the 50s Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg were able to keep working only because they formed a business designing window displays for Fifth Avenue stores. Artists have been half-bourgeois, half-social outsiders ever since they won independence from traditional systems of aristocratic patronage. Artists earn almost nothing until and unless they become stars, names, figures of a certain perceived significance in contemporary art history. \"To be successful as an artist,\" wrote Andy Warhol with candour, \"you have to have your work shown in a good gallery for the same reason that, say, Dior never sold his originals from a counter in Woolworth's ...

After the recent drama over petrol and the titanic clash between market forces and the environment, I decided to find a third way. I explored fuels other than the wretched Opec juice. Among the sites I found under 'electric car', I was most impressed by <a href=\"http://www.car-stuff.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.car-stuff.com</a>, with its broad range of links, dealers and much relevant information.</p> <p>However, image matters, and none of the electric cars looked nearly as cool as the VW Beetle. Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.volkswagen.com.br\" target=\"_NEW\">www.volkswagen.com.br</a>, I discovered that the Brazilian version of the Beetle is powered by sugar-cane alcohol. Just imagine: no blackmail from the sheikhs, no fuel tax from Gordon... The only problem is that sugarcane alcohol is not that easy to find here (Bacardi is even more expensive than Shell's best), so I'd have to import a tanker-load of the stuff from Rio. It might be more realistic to do like the Queen and convert my car to liquified petroleum gas. Pleasantly scented, highly eco-friendly and lightly taxed (I mean the fuel, but HM is, too). The only drawback of LPG is that you can find it only in a few petrol stations for the time being. If you are interested, check <a href=\"http://www.autogas.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.autogas.co.uk</a>.</p> <p>Fighting with a ghastly woman at our local late-night shop over the last loaf of bread (and it wasn't Duchy of Cornwall organic!) made me realise the importance of essentials. Never again will I be caught unprepared. I ordered a bread-maker from <a href=\"http://www.divertimenti.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.divertimenti.co.uk</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.breadworld.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.breadworld.com</a> has recipes for every type of bread I can think of. Next time farmers and friends revolt, I'll be able to come out to my minimalist Zen-inspired terrace and shout: 'Laissez-les manger du gateau!'

      "bodyText": "Two weeks have gone by, but the turmoil of those uncertain days remains seared on my mind. After the recent drama over petrol and the titanic clash between market forces and the environment, I decided to find a third way. I explored fuels other than the wretched Opec juice. Among the sites I found under 'electric car', I was most impressed by www.car-stuff.com, with its broad range of links, dealers and much relevant information. However, image matters, and none of the electric cars looked nearly as cool as the VW Beetle. Thanks to www.volkswagen.com.br, I discovered that the Brazilian version of the Beetle is powered by sugar-cane alcohol. Just imagine: no blackmail from the sheikhs, no fuel tax from Gordon... The only problem is that sugarcane alcohol is not that easy to find here (Bacardi is even more expensive than Shell's best), so I'd have to import a tanker-load of the stuff from Rio. It might be more realistic to do like the Queen and convert my car to liquified petroleum gas. Pleasantly scented, highly eco-friendly and lightly taxed (I mean the fuel, but HM is, too). The only drawback of LPG is that you can find it only in a few petrol stations for the time being. If you are interested, check www.autogas.co.uk. Fighting with a ghastly woman at our local late-night shop over the last loaf of bread (and it wasn't Duchy of Cornwall organic!) made me realise the importance of essentials. Never again will I be caught unprepared. I ordered a bread-maker from www.divertimenti.co.uk, and www.breadworld.com has recipes for every type of bread I can think of. Next time farmers and friends revolt, I'll be able to come out to my minimalist Zen-inspired terrace and shout: 'Laissez-les manger du gateau!' ('Let them eat cake' - www.learnfrenchlanguage.com). \u0095 Email Tanya at: tanya@gorgeoustanya.co.uk; or visit her website at: www.gorgeoustanya.co.uk",

      "byline": "Lindsay Baker",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When they first emerged in 1997, All Saints were a breath of fresh air. Scruffy, authentic, this was no put-together, cynically marketed band - these girls were friends, they actually hung out together. And they wrote their own songs - or at least one of them did. They may not have been an all-black band, but with songs such as the smooth, soulful hit Never Ever, they displayed that all-important feel for the nuances of R&amp;B and hip hop, not to mention a penchant for the kind of dance moves more usually seen in gangsta-girl rap. </p> <p>Not only that, but their look - tomboyish, oh-so-casual but sexy, with trainers, and baggy combat trousers slung low to reveal ever so gently rounded tummies - was a sudden and huge hit, transforming within a few months how young girls wanted to look. They didn't have to proclaim girl power; they embodied it. They followed up the single with an accomplished eponymous album in a similarly glossy and seductive vein. It went multi-platinum - that's more than 10 million copies worldwide. The following year, they scooped up two Brit awards for Never Ever and its video. </p> <p>After such an auspicious start, however, it has not been a smooth ride. Over the past couple of years, you couldn't glance at a gossip column without spotting them. First, there were the public rows and fallings out, with one or other of them threatening to leave the band. Then they began to be snapped by the tabloid press while out on the town (usually the Appleton sisters, with their latest high-profile boyfriends). Before long they were vilified for their incessant partying, drunken antics and string of suitors, the very things that had attracted the press in the first place. </p> <p>At one show, a member of the audience displayed a huge banner with the words Pure Whores emblazoned on it, a play on the title of this summer's single, Pure Shores. They gained a reputation for being stroppy and arrogant. \"The bitches are back\" went the headline for a recent men's magazine article, while one women's magazine ran the cover line, \"Why the world hates the Appleton sisters\". And then there was that venture into movies with Honest, in which all of them (bar Shaznay) acted and which bombed in the UK earlier this year. But still, the mellow, infectious Pure Shores was a huge hit - so far, it remains the biggest-selling UK single this year. And now the band are releasing a second album, Saints And Sinners. </p> <p>Today, All Saints have gathered in a north London photographic studio with a 13-strong entourage - including management, minder, hair, make-up, wardrobe, PA, PR. Nicole Appleton takes frequent calls on her mobile, gossiping and giggling happily. Natalie, her older sister, is cool but chirpy enough. Melanie Blatt is slightly stony-faced. Shaznay Lewis is quiet and amenable. </p> <p>Shaznay is the songwriter - and the one with the extraordinary helium-voiced singing style. She grew up on the Caledonian Road, north London, and says there was always music playing at home: Bob Marley, Johnny Mathis, Calypso, Curtis Stigers. \"I never for a split-second thought about doing anything else,\" she says. She's in jeans, a grey \"Harlem\" sweatshirt and no make-up. She's startlingly beautiful, big-eyed and long-lashed: a child-woman face. Now 25, she wrote her first song at 13, while attending a music workshop at her local youth club. Unusually, around that same time she converted to Catholicism, although she went to a Church of England school. She was taken to Mass by a neighbour. \"I'm amazed my mum let me do it. I think the idea of me being able to dress up in a bright gown and take bread in front of the altar boys was appealing to me,\" she laughs. </p> <p>She didn't get a job when she left school, but signed on the dole to pursue her music, which her mother found slightly weird, \"because no matter what job she'd done in life, she'd never depended on government money to bring me and my sister up\". Her Jamaican mother still works as a dinner lady. \"Not for herself. It's in case I hit a rainy day, or my sister, or anyone in my family. That's the kind of person she is.\" Her father is Barbadian and a retired bus driver. \"We were the richest of the poor,\" she says of her childhood. </p> <p>Shaznay met Melanie Blatt at All Saints studio in west London, where both were session singers, experimenting with demos. They joined forces, and spent three years signing on and fronting All Saints. They reckoned they were given \"bad advice\", and decided to take matters into their own hands. They were soon joined by the Appleton sisters - and signed up by London Records. </p> <p>Shaznay wrote the melancholy Never Ever and the debut album just after she and her ex-boyfriend had split up. For this new album, she says, she couldn't \"dig out the sad songs\", because for the past couple of years she's been in a happy, stable relationship with Christian Storm, a dancer. So, Saints And Sinners is a more upbeat affair (both Natalie and Mel wrote tracks, too, but the rest are Shaznay's work), and there are four tracks (including the particularly infectious Black Coffee) produced by William Orbit, who has also worked with Madonna. The vocals are tighter this time around, though the formula is similar to before - breakbeats or samples, with harmonies over the top. Shaznay is proud of the \"quirky, comical\" tracks on the album, and makes no excuses for her \"commercial lyrics\". Not that all of the music she listens to is uniformly commercial - she cites Alanis Morissette, Everlast, House of Pain, Sonique and Artful Dodger as current favourites. And she loves rap: \"Not the violent kind of rap, but I look at it as an interesting form of poetry.\" During the making of the album, there was some pressure from the record company to \"do a Destiny's Child\", as Shaznay puts it. \"They were going through that phase, you know, they'd been watching too much MTV. So we went off and tried it, but it sounded too R&amp;B, so we kind of closed our ears to everybody after a while.\" </p> <p>In the past few years, Shaznay has been far less visible than the other All Saints. She says that she doesn't party so much any more, and that when she does it's only for a \"big occasion\". Her relatively low profile has also, no doubt, been due to her non-appearance in Honest, which featured Natalie, Nicole and Mel as East End sisters involved in a heist in London's swinging 60s. Although the girls' performances were praised, the hugely hyped gangster movie failed dismally, despite a glitzy premiere at Cannes this year, with director Dave Stewart blaming its 18 certificate (there are drug-taking and orgy scenes). Shaznay wasn't invited to audition because there was no role suitable for her. </p> <p>She hasn't seen the film yet, she says. She chose not to go to the premiere - it was the day before a promotional trip, she explains carefully, and she wanted to spend time with her loved ones. She had planned to see it in Los Angeles, but it had been withdrawn early from general release. Was she upset that she wasn't asked to be involved? \"Maybe I would have been a bit peeved if I'd been sat at home doing nothing. But at the time the girls were doing the film, I went into the recording studio in LA and wrote Pure Shores.\" She pauses, and smiles. \"So it worked out fine.\" </p> <p>Wasn't there ever some inkling of feeling exploited, of grafting while the others swanned around? \"If I look at it from their point of view, the girls probably felt even more the need to find something that they could call their own - though the music that I write they could never not call their own: it is theirs, it's for all of us. I don't class them as my songs; I class them as our songs. But something that they could go off and say, 'Yeah, I did that by myself', that's what they needed to do, so who am I to throw a fit about it?\" </p> <p>She concedes, however, that she had misgivings about the film. \"The only thing I was a bit gutted about was that, during the whole lead-up to the film, I kept pointing out, 'They're calling it an All Saints film, and it's not.'\" This had nothing to do with the fact that she wasn't in it, she says. Just that, good or bad, she wanted the girls to be able to come back to the band afterwards untouched by it and able to continue with their musical careers. \"It wasn't the girls themselves who were trying to associate it with All Saints,\" she's quick to point out. \"What they were trying to do at the time was get away from being All Saints.\" Dave Stewart, then? \"Yeah, totally. People are going to do that to bring in the buyers and the attention. They're going to call it an All Saints film.\" </p> <p>If anyone in the group is the leader, it's Shaznay. Not only is she the songwriter, but she also has a level-headedness about her that you'd imagine would come in handy in a band such as this one. \"People may look to me as a group leader, though I like to be in the background. But I show people both sides of the coin.\" She is the diplomatic one. When she does lose her temper, it shocks people, she says. \"Nat can take a leadership role in the sense where she'll blow her top in the first few seconds. A lot of the time I'll go, 'Oh, Natalie', and be embarrassed, then there are other times when it's called for - and, then again, there are times when it is really called for and she doesn't do it, and you're like, 'Go on, Nat'.\" </p> <p>Because they came together as friends, rather than as a money-making proposition, All Saints have always behaved as such - hence the public rows and drunken exploits. \"Young commercial bands don't really do things like that,\" she says. \"That sort of stuff is associated with the rock'n'roll bands. But I'm really glad that we've always been who we were from the beginning.\" The music industry is \"a big money-making machine, and the ones who get, excuse my French, fucked over are the ones who are really into music. The industry isn't interested in that. That's why record companies will always love manufacturing bands because it's a case of being told what to do, when to do it: 'Sing this hit song that's been written by so-and-so, and it's a smash and you look fabulous.' \" </p> <p>But then, All Saints have hardly turned their backs on glamour, have they? From the start, their look has been unequivocally sexy. \"We're four kind of cheeky girls, we're quite daring. But the funny thing is, we never actually tried to be sexy. At the time, we wanted to be like tomboys. You've got a lot of these female artists that come out now in bikinis. It's too try-hard and 'Please say I'm sexy'. With us, it was baggy pants and maybe a g-string hanging out because the pants were so big and heavy, but people took to that more.\" </p> <p>Most of their fans are young girls, she says, most are white and most have their favourite - which is always Nicole, Natalie or Mel. \"Which I can understand, because they're not going to relate to me - they're not going to be able to do their hair like me, or whatever. But it has made me wonder if I appeal to little black girls. I hope I do.\" She admires artists such as Lauryn Hill, who have an audience that is racially mixed. \"In the beginning, you don't think of those things. In the area where I grew up, it was very mixed and it was never an issue to me. I was never brought up to think of black or white in any way, shape or form, but now I'm dead proud when I've looked down and seen black people at the front!\" </p> <p>Shaznay has no plans to go solo for the moment, and says that, when she eventually has children, she won't want to be doing what she's doing now. \"I'll want to be at home, just being a mum.\" Fame and success have made her \"tougher\", but they have also made her \"long for normality. I have kind of regained that. When I go home and shut the door, I'm just Shaznay Lewis from Caledonian Road. But then it's Shaznay Lewis getting into a flash car,\" she adds with a laugh. She owns a convertible Audi and a Jeep Cherokee - as the writer in the band, she gets considerably larger royalties than the others. </p> <p>When it comes to celebrity, however, Shaznay maintains that you have to take the rough with the smooth. She was \"surprised\" when she was photographed on holiday with her boyfriend in Barbados earlier this year, but not angry. \"I keep my guard up so that I'm unaffected by all of it. Sometimes the girls get upset about things that are said about them, and sometimes they're quite happy to see it. I think, personally, you should feel one way about all of it, so that regardless of whatever's been printed you're always going to feel a certain way inside. You will always be able to keep your composure.\" </p> <p>Melanie Blatt used to be known as the \"mouthy\" one. Not any more, she says. \"I've calmed down a lot.\" She slouches on the sofa with a picturesquely petulant look about her. She lives in south London with Stuart Zender, former bass player with Jamiroquai, and their little girl, Lily. Zender co-produced one of the tracks on Saints And Sinners, along with former Young Disciple, Femi Williams. </p> <p>Mel's French mother and English father were hippies who named her after the 60s singer Melanie and took her to Glastonbury when she was nine months old. She had ambitions to be a ballet dancer, but that was ruled out after an operation on her spine, so she went to the Sylvia Young Theatre School, where she met Nicole and Natalie (along with Emma Bunton, later to be Baby Spice). </p> <p>Much of Blatt's childhood was spent in France, and Shaznay was her first real female friend in London. \"We're very compatible,\" she says. The early years weren't always easy: \"When you look back on it, it was a struggle sometimes, but I'm glad we went through those years, really working hard. I like to work.\" </p> <p>She never thought that they'd be a pop band; rather an \"underground\" band, famous perhaps in west London. Not that she minds, of course. When they first became well known, she had \"a good six months\" of going out and being seen, \"when it was all new and exciting. It's nice to walk in somewhere and everyone goes, 'Ooh!' \" she laughs. \"That's nice, but it can only last so long.\" </p> <p>Mel doesn't seem bothered by the band's reputation for stroppiness.\"There are certain rules that you have to play by, which we don't, which is why we have press attention. And it's like they always say: if a man doesn't want to do something, he's strong, but if you're a woman you're a fucking bitch.\" Has it made her tougher, being in this industry? \"You can never trust anybody 100% in this business, that's why you have to be strong.\" </p> <p>She didn't much enjoy making the film, she says. \"No, not really. It was too long on one project.\" As for more acting, \"maybe, but I wouldn't take it seriously. I'm a singer.\" She's a no-nonsense kind of girl, Mel - she has a life outside all of this, and that is her priority. She thinks she may buy a house in France eventually, but for the moment they'll stay in south London. How long does she think she'll continue with All Saints? \"I'd like there to be a tenth album, just to say 'ha ha' to people who've doubted us. But, realistically, with Lily I can't do this for the rest of my life.\" </p> <p>In contrast to Mel, Nicole Appleton has a breezy way about her, smiley, sunny and irrepressibly cheerful - as well she might. New album, new man: life is just peachy for the beautiful (they're all beautiful) Nicole. She is unrelentingly upbeat, even on the subject of her film debut. \"I thought I didn't really do such a bad job, so I'm not going to feel totally ripped to pieces. I've become fairly ballsy about it.\" She finds it hard when people close to her are affected by criticism of her. \"But otherwise, I couldn't give a shit. I'd be in the madhouse if I did. It's just part of my job.\" </p> <p>She beams broadly. From the age of 18 or 19, Nicole (now 25) was always the one who wanted to go out, to have fun, she says in her transatlantic drawl (which she's \"dying\" to get rid of). And she always wanted to perform. She and her sisters (there are two others, as well as Natalie) were born and raised in Canada to British parents. When their parents split, they lived first with their mother in New York state and then in London with their father, where they attended Sylvia Young's school. Then came a return to the US and unsuccessful attempts to get into showbusiness. Their parents got back together, and the sisters returned to Britain, where a chance meeting with Mel's father at the Sports Cafe in London, where Nicole was waitressing, led to a reunion with their old theatre-school friend. Mel asked the sisters to join a band she had formed with Shaznay. All Saints became a foursome, and their careers took off. </p> <p>After the success of the first album, Nicole found that suddenly she was \"a somebody\". She received a lot of \"positive attention\" when she and Robbie Williams got engaged. She loved it. \"Totally. The world was my best friend. I would say to the reporters, 'This is what Robbie and I are doing', and, 'We're going to move here.'\" But after they split up, she found that the tone of the stories changed, and became more and more lurid - there was always a list of men attached to her name. \"It all started going fucking AWOL for me. It was, like, everything I did ... I'm supposed to have this reputation. I'm considered this bad person and I'm so not.\" </p> <p>There have been a few stories that she says are just not true. The in-the-toilet-with-Leonardo-DiCaprio was one such: \"That was kind of embarrassing for my family, and so not my style, anyway. I would never, even in some private house with a guy I'm seeing - in the toilet! It just doesn't work like that.\" Some of the men she's been linked to (such as Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt), she claims never to have even met. Men don't get that, she says. Whereas figures such as Robbie Williams are congratulated in the press for their string of affairs (Williams encourages girlfriends to sell stories about his sexual prowess, she claims), it's a different story for women. The plastic surgery story (it was reported that she'd had a liposuction operation on her thighs) she says was also untrue: \"I did have a dream that I had a breast job, and I was surrounded by people and I was standing there going, 'Don't touch me, don't touch me!' It was a dream, though.\" </p> <p>There were other, more serious difficulties to contend with, as well - such as the stalker who harassed her for a month earlier this year. She reacted angrily, going out in the evenings by herself. \"It was really wrong of me to do that, and I got yelled at about it by my family, but it's just your natural reaction if someone's invading you.\" In the end, she and a male friend confronted the stalker, and it stopped. \"I just got really worried about my family, that's the only thing that can really get to me. Someone fucks with my family and that's it.\" She seems a robust kind of girl, but not quite as combative as she, in common with the rest of the band, has been characterised. How does she think they gained that reputation? \"Well, if we're gonna have a fight, we're gonna fight. We're not going to say, 'Let's go somewhere in private and have a fight.' We've had loads of fights.\" </p> <p>At one point it was reported that she was leaving the band. She wasn't getting on with their then manager, she says, she'd begun to feel like a \"robot\" and simply wanted a break. \"It's very difficult to be friends and have a business relationship.\" The differences they had were caused by the people around them. \"That's why we got rid of a lot of people at the beginning of the year. We changed our management, got rid of lawyers. It was just not working, it wasn't right. We were just not getting anywhere.\" It was she who initiated all of that, she says. \"There were a lot of blowouts because I felt like I was the only one trying to make a point.\" Of course, the situation may not have been helped by the fact that three of them went off for a prolonged period to make the film. How must Shaznay have felt? \"She was so supportive,\" says Nicole, \"but I don't know if that's how she felt ...\" </p> <p>Now all of these difficulties are behind her, and Nicole is thoroughly delighted with life. Her new boyfriend, Liam Gallagher of Oasis, is an \"absolute top gem\" and \"totally rooted\". She's certainly not fazed by his hell-raiser reputation; in fact, she's suspicious of \"squeaky-clean\" celebrities - the ones who are portrayed as the bad ones are generally the more honest, she says. \"If they want to tell someone to fuck off, then they will.\" She grins contentedly - she is smitten, and is not pretending otherwise. It sounds like love's young dream. With Robbie, she says, she sensed a certain, albeit unspoken, competitiveness in the relationship, but with Liam it's \"totally different\", and he is supportive of her music and career. And he's met her mother. He surprised her: she'd had a vision in her head of how he might be with her, \"like everyone else, thinking, 'Oh my God.' But they were sitting there - yak, yak, yak.\" </p> <p>Nicole does not get involved in Liam's troubles with Patsy Kensit, from whom he is now divorced: as far as she's concerned, it's none of her business. \"He doesn't come to me and tell me his problems. That's something he's had to deal with, and still has to deal with. I just want him to be happy and that's it.\" </p> <p>\"I've learnt my lesson,\" she says, puffing on a Silk Cut. \"I've been there, I've been everywhere, every club, had a great time, but it's time to calm down.\" Whether that ambition is altogether realistic remains to be seen, but she loves England, she loves the rain, the pubs, the food. If she were to buy another home, it would be in Ireland (her mother is Irish, she says). She's not ready to settle down and have babies, though. \"Work's too full-on at the moment, I just couldn't handle it. If I was pregnant now I'd probably, I don't know, just be really emotional and sick all over the place.\" </p> <p>Nicole's enthusiasm about Liam is touching. \"You'd love him! You'd think, Nic was right, he's great.\" She thinks the fact that they are both so busy will help keep the relationship exciting. She doesn't know if she's in love yet, but, \"It feels really right. That's what's scary. I don't want to get hurt, no one ever does, do they? But you know,\" she beams, \"I think if I can't do it, I don't know who can.\" </p> <p>Nicole's older sister, Natalie, who's 26, used to be an aerobics instructor - probably a very fierce and effective one. Her eyes brim with indignation. She was particularly unamused by the \"Why the world hates the Appleton sisters\" line: \"I thought, 'Holy shit, what is that all about?' The world hates us? Are we responsible for the war in Bosnia? Are we responsible for the Millennium Dome?\" </p> <p>She is famous for flying off the handle on a regular basis. Get her on certain topics, and she seethes with rage. \"They put Nic and me down, and say we're party animals. And women can be very catty about us. It's upsetting because I'm a woman's woman, and I'm against all that home-wrecking stuff. You don't fuck around with your friends' boyfriends. It happens a lot in this business, and everyone pretends to be goody-two-shoes, and Nic and I are the only ones who get any shit, and we're the ones who don't do stuff like that. I could just expose so many goody-two-shoes.\" Her mobile phone rings. It's Donna Air, the MTV presenter. \"She's moving in next door,\" she says, more calmly. \"She'll be coming round to borrow the sugar - or the vodka.\" She laughs. </p> <p>Natalie has a daughter, Rachel, who is eight years old. The father left the short-lived marriage one year after she was born, \"when I needed the help more than anything. I was on my own, no help, nothing.\" Being a single parent is \"the toughest thing in the world\". In the past year, the father has started seeing his daughter again, once a week or so. Natalie is \"kind of bitter\", and \"totally cynical\" about men (hardly any wonder, given the unedifying kiss-and-tell conduct of some of her exes). Still, that may have changed by now. A week or so after our chat, she started seeing Liam Howlett of the Prodigy (the Appleton sisters went on holiday this summer to the south of France, with both Liams in tow). She finds success sexy, she says, which may account both for Howlett and her past two long-term boyfriends - TV presenter Jamie Theakston (\"We're good friends now. He's an adult and he's smart. I get advice from him every now and then\") and actor Jonny Lee Miller. </p> <p>She approves of her sister's latest choice of man. \"He is such a big pussycat, and he's honest. He's spent a lot of time with my family. He's just a great, great person. He's always got a good thing to say. If people upset him, he'll have a go because he gets hurt. But, you know, everything we do musically, he's just, like, 'That's fuckin' great.' You can't condemn him if it doesn't work out, because he's still a young guy, and he got married at 22, and he needs to enjoy his life. Whatever happens between him and Nic, it doesn't matter. I'll always love him to death, and he'll always have us as friends.\" </p> <p>Does she want more children? \"I so want more. I want a home and family and husband. That's what I'm after now. The day I can afford to retire, I will, and I'll sing for fun. Even if All Saints don't exist, I'll still be Natalie Appleton, I'll still want to perform.\" </p> <p>Perhaps it's the Sylvia Young showbiz training. The Appleton sisters, like Mel, give the impression that All Saints is a job, not an all-consuming passion. If they hadn't done this, they would no doubt have found some other careers in the performing arts. With Shaznay, it's different: she never wanted to do anything else - for her, it is a compulsion. She, too, has a life outside All Saints, but you get the feeling that her love of music is something that she would have pursued regardless of success and the convertible parked outside. </p> <p>Just so long as Shaznay keeps those songs coming, All Saints should do fine. Without her songs, however - and, I'd guess, without her calming influence - they wouldn't exist. For a while it looked as if All Saints would implode, but not now. </p> <p>They may fall out, they may get drunk and lairy, but, if anything, it's their sulky, stroppy, bad-girl ways that is their appeal. It always has been. They probably know that - why else call the album Saints And Sinners? There's a what-you-see-is-what-you-get quality about them. They tell it like it is. It's tough being a single mother. Men can be crap. It's fun going out with Liam Gallagher. It's fun to drink vodka, or pints of lager. It's nice to be famous, up to a point. </p> <p>It's six o'clock, and the photoshoot is done. The girls are scooped up by their minder into a top-of-the-range people-carrier. Natalie and Nicole are off out for a drink with some starry friends at a newly opened bar. Mel's off home to south London. And Shaznay's working day has just begun - it's back to the recording studio for her, to put some final touches to the album </p> <p> \u0095 The album Saints And Sinners is released on October 16.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When they first emerged in 1997, All Saints were a breath of fresh air. Scruffy, authentic, this was no put-together, cynically marketed band - these girls were friends, they actually hung out together. And they wrote their own songs - or at least one of them did. They may not have been an all-black band, but with songs such as the smooth, soulful hit Never Ever, they displayed that all-important feel for the nuances of R&amp;B and hip hop, not to mention a penchant for the kind of dance moves more usually seen in gangsta-girl rap. Not only that, but their look - tomboyish, oh-so-casual but sexy, with trainers, and baggy combat trousers slung low to reveal ever so gently rounded tummies - was a sudden and huge hit, transforming within a few months how young girls wanted to look. They didn't have to proclaim girl power; they embodied it. They followed up the single with an accomplished eponymous album in a similarly glossy and seductive vein. It went multi-platinum - that's more than 10 million copies worldwide. The following year, they scooped up two Brit awards for Never Ever and its video. After such an auspicious start, however, it has not been a smooth ride. Over the past couple of years, you couldn't glance at a gossip column without spotting them. First, there were the public rows and fallings out, with one or other of them threatening to leave the band. Then they began to be snapped by the tabloid press while out on the town (usually the Appleton sisters, with their latest high-profile boyfriends). Before long they were vilified for their incessant partying, drunken antics and string of suitors, the very things that had attracted the press in the first place. At one show, a member of the audience displayed a huge banner with the words Pure Whores emblazoned on it, a play on the title of this summer's single, Pure Shores. They gained a reputation for being stroppy and arrogant. \"The bitches are back\" went the headline for a recent men's magazine article, while one women's magazine ran the cover line, \"Why the world hates the Appleton sisters\". And then there was that venture into movies with Honest, in which all of them (bar Shaznay) acted and which bombed in the UK earlier this year. But still, the mellow, infectious Pure Shores was a huge hit - so far, it remains the biggest-selling UK single this year. And now the band are releasing a second album, Saints And Sinners. Today, All Saints have gathered in a north London photographic studio with a 13-strong entourage - including management, minder, hair, make-up, wardrobe, PA, PR. Nicole Appleton takes frequent calls on her mobile, gossiping and giggling happily. Natalie, her older sister, is cool but chirpy enough. Melanie Blatt is slightly stony-faced. Shaznay Lewis is quiet and amenable. Shaznay is the songwriter - and the one with the extraordinary helium-voiced singing style. She grew up on the Caledonian Road, north London, and says there was always music playing at home: Bob Marley, Johnny Mathis, Calypso, Curtis Stigers. \"I never for a split-second thought about doing anything else,\" she says. She's in jeans, a grey \"Harlem\" sweatshirt and no make-up. She's startlingly beautiful, big-eyed and long-lashed: a child-woman face. Now 25, she wrote her first song at 13, while attending a music workshop at her local youth club. Unusually, around that same time she converted to Catholicism, although she went to a Church of England school. She was taken to Mass by a neighbour. \"I'm amazed my mum let me do it. I think the idea of me being able to dress up in a bright gown and take bread in front of the altar boys was appealing to me,\" she laughs. She didn't get a job when she left school, but signed on the dole to pursue her music, which her mother found slightly weird, \"because no matter what job she'd done in life, she'd never depended on government money to bring me and my sister up\". Her Jamaican mother still works as a dinner lady. \"Not for herself. It's in case I hit a rainy day, or my sister, or anyone in my family. That's the kind of person she is.\" Her father is Barbadian and a retired bus driver. \"We were the richest of the poor,\" she says of her childhood. Shaznay met Melanie Blatt at All Saints studio in west London, where both were session singers, experimenting with demos. They joined forces, and spent three years signing on and fronting All Saints. They reckoned they were given \"bad advice\", and decided to take matters into their own hands. They were soon joined by the Appleton sisters - and signed up by London Records. Shaznay wrote the melancholy Never Ever and the debut album just after she and her ex-boyfriend had split up. For this new album, she says, she couldn't \"dig out the sad songs\", because for the past couple of years she's been in a happy, stable relationship with Christian Storm, a dancer. So, Saints And Sinners is a more upbeat affair (both Natalie and Mel wrote tracks, too, but the rest are Shaznay's work), and there are four tracks (including the particularly infectious Black Coffee) produced by William Orbit, who has also worked with Madonna. The vocals are tighter this time around, though the formula is similar to before - breakbeats or samples, with harmonies over the top. Shaznay is proud of the \"quirky, comical\" tracks on the album, and makes no excuses for her \"commercial lyrics\". Not that all of the music she listens to is uniformly commercial - she cites Alanis Morissette, Everlast, House of Pain, Sonique and Artful Dodger as current favourites. And she loves rap: \"Not the violent kind of rap, but I look at it as an interesting form of poetry.\" During the making of the album, there was some pressure from the record company to \"do a Destiny's Child\", as Shaznay puts it. \"They were going through that phase, you know, they'd been watching too much MTV. So we went off and tried it, but it sounded too R&amp;B, so we kind of closed our ears to everybody after a while.\" In the past few years, Shaznay has been far less visible than the other All Saints. She says that she doesn't party so much any more, and that when she does it's only for a \"big occasion\". Her relatively low profile has also, no doubt, been due to her non-appearance in Honest, which featured Natalie, Nicole and Mel as East End sisters involved in a heist in London's swinging 60s. Although the girls' performances were praised, the hugely hyped gangster movie failed dismally, despite a glitzy premiere at Cannes this year, with director Dave Stewart blaming its 18 certificate (there are drug-taking and orgy scenes). Shaznay wasn't invited to audition because there was no role suitable for her. She hasn't seen the film yet, she says. She chose not to go to the premiere - it was the day before a promotional trip, she explains carefully, and she wanted to spend time with her loved ones. She had planned to see it in Los Angeles, but it had been withdrawn early from general release. Was she upset that she wasn't asked to be involved? \"Maybe I would have been a bit peeved if I'd been sat at home doing nothing. But at the time the girls were doing the film, I went into the recording studio in LA and wrote Pure Shores.\" She pauses, and smiles. \"So it worked out fine.\" Wasn't there ever some inkling of feeling exploited, of grafting while the others swanned around? \"If I look at it from their point of view, the girls probably felt even more the need to find something that they could call their own - though the music that I write they could never not call their own: it is theirs, it's for all of us. I don't class them as my songs; I class them as our songs. But something that they could go off and say, 'Yeah, I did that by myself', that's what they needed to do, so who am I to throw a fit about it?\" She concedes, however, that she had misgivings about the film. \"The only thing I was a bit gutted about was that, during the whole lead-up to the film, I kept pointing out, 'They're calling it an All Saints film, and it's not.'\" This had nothing to do with the fact that she wasn't in it, she says. Just that, good or bad, she wanted the girls to be able to come back to the band afterwards untouched by it and able to continue with their musical careers. \"It wasn't the girls themselves who were trying to associate it with All Saints,\" she's quick to point out. \"What they were trying to do at the time was get away from being All Saints.\" Dave Stewart, then? \"Yeah, totally. People are going to do that to bring in the buyers and the attention. They're going to call it an All Saints film.\" If anyone in the group is the leader, it's Shaznay. Not only is she the songwriter, but she also has a level-headedness about her that you'd imagine would come in handy in a band such as this one. \"People may look to me as a group leader, though I like to be in the background. But I show people both sides of the coin.\" She is the diplomatic one. When she does lose her temper, it shocks people, she says. \"Nat can take a leadership role in the sense where she'll blow her top in the first few seconds. A lot of the time I'll go, 'Oh, Natalie', and be embarrassed, then there are other times when it's called for - and, then again, there are times when it is really called for and she doesn't do it, and you're like, 'Go on, Nat'.\" Because they came together as friends, rather than as a money-making proposition, All Saints have always behaved as such - hence the public rows and drunken exploits. \"Young commercial bands don't really do things like that,\" she says. \"That sort of stuff is associated with the rock'n'roll bands. But I'm really glad that we've always been who we were from the beginning.\" The music industry is \"a big money-making machine, and the ones who get, excuse my French, fucked over are the ones who are really into music. The industry isn't interested in that. That's why record companies will always love manufacturing bands because it's a case of being told what to do, when to do it: 'Sing this hit song that's been written by so-and-so, and it's a smash and you look fabulous.' \" But then, All Saints have hardly turned their backs on glamour, have they? From the start, their look has been unequivocally sexy. \"We're four kind of cheeky girls, we're quite daring. But the funny thing is, we never actually tried to be sexy. At the time, we wanted to be like tomboys. You've got a lot of these female artists that come out now in bikinis. It's too try-hard and 'Please say I'm sexy'. With us, it was baggy pants and maybe a g-string hanging out because the pants were so big and heavy, but people took to that more.\" Most of their fans are young girls, she says, most are white and most have their favourite - which is always Nicole, Natalie or Mel. \"Which I can understand, because they're not going to relate to me - they're not going to be able to do their hair like me, or whatever. But it has made me wonder if I appeal to little black girls. I hope I do.\" She admires artists such as Lauryn Hill, who have an audience that is racially mixed. \"In the beginning, you don't think of those things. In the area where I grew up, it was very mixed and it was never an issue to me. I was never brought up to think of black or white in any way, shape or form, but now I'm dead proud when I've looked down and seen black people at the front!\" Shaznay has no plans to go solo for the moment, and says that, when she eventually has children, she won't want to be doing what she's doing now. \"I'll want to be at home, just being a mum.\" Fame and success have made her \"tougher\", but they have also made her \"long for normality. I have kind of regained that. When I go home and shut the door, I'm just Shaznay Lewis from Caledonian Road. But then it's Shaznay Lewis getting into a flash car,\" she adds with a laugh. She owns a convertible Audi and a Jeep Cherokee - as the writer in the band, she gets considerably larger royalties than the others. When it comes to celebrity, however, Shaznay maintains that you have to take the rough with the smooth. She was \"surprised\" when she was photographed on holiday with her boyfriend in Barbados earlier this year, but not angry. \"I keep my guard up so that I'm unaffected by all of it. Sometimes the girls get upset about things that are said about them, and sometimes they're quite happy to see it. I think, personally, you should feel one way about all of it, so that regardless of whatever's been printed you're always going to feel a certain way inside. You will always be able to keep your composure.\" Melanie Blatt used to be known as the \"mouthy\" one. Not any more, she says. \"I've calmed down a lot.\" She slouches on the sofa with a picturesquely petulant look about her. She lives in south London with Stuart Zender, former bass player with Jamiroquai, and their little girl, Lily. Zender co-produced one of the tracks on Saints And Sinners, along with former Young Disciple, Femi Williams. Mel's French mother and English father were hippies who named her after the 60s singer Melanie and took her to Glastonbury when she was nine months old. She had ambitions to be a ballet dancer, but that was ruled out after an operation on her spine, so she went to the Sylvia Young Theatre School, where she met Nicole and Natalie (along with Emma Bunton, later to be Baby Spice). Much of Blatt's childhood was spent in France, and Shaznay was her first real female friend in London. \"We're very compatible,\" she says. The early years weren't always easy: \"When you look back on it, it was a struggle sometimes, but I'm glad we went through those years, really working hard. I like to work.\" She never thought that they'd be a pop band; rather an \"underground\" band, famous perhaps in west London. Not that she minds, of course. When they first became well known, she had \"a good six months\" of going out and being seen, \"when it was all new and exciting. It's nice to walk in somewhere and everyone goes, 'Ooh!' \" she laughs. \"That's nice, but it can only last so long.\" Mel doesn't seem bothered by the band's reputation for stroppiness.\"There are certain rules that you have to play by, which we don't, which is why we have press attention. And it's like they always say: if a man doesn't want to do something, he's strong, but if you're a woman you're a fucking bitch.\" Has it made her tougher, being in this industry? \"You can never trust anybody 100% in this business, that's why you have to be strong.\" She didn't much enjoy making the film, she says. \"No, not really. It was too long on one project.\" As for more acting, \"maybe, but I wouldn't take it seriously. I'm a singer.\" She's a no-nonsense kind of girl, Mel - she has a life outside all of this, and that is her priority. She thinks she may buy a house in France eventually, but for the moment they'll stay in south London. How long does she think she'll continue with All Saints? \"I'd like there to be a tenth album, just to say 'ha ha' to people who've doubted us. But, realistically, with Lily I can't do this for the rest of my life.\" In contrast to Mel, Nicole Appleton has a breezy way about her, smiley, sunny and irrepressibly cheerful - as well she might. New album, new man: life is just peachy for the beautiful (they're all beautiful) Nicole. She is unrelentingly upbeat, even on the subject of her film debut. \"I thought I didn't really do such a bad job, so I'm not going to feel totally ripped to pieces. I've become fairly ballsy about it.\" She finds it hard when people close to her are affected by criticism of her. \"But otherwise, I couldn't give a shit. I'd be in the madhouse if I did. It's just part of my job.\" She beams broadly. From the age of 18 or 19, Nicole (now 25) was always the one who wanted to go out, to have fun, she says in her transatlantic drawl (which she's \"dying\" to get rid of). And she always wanted to perform. She and her sisters (there are two others, as well as Natalie) were born and raised in Canada to British parents. When their parents split, they lived first with their mother in New York state and then in London with their father, where they attended Sylvia Young's school. Then came a return to the US and unsuccessful attempts to get into showbusiness. Their parents got back together, and the sisters returned to Britain, where a chance meeting with Mel's father at the Sports Cafe in London, where Nicole was waitressing, led to a reunion with their old theatre-school friend. Mel asked the sisters to join a band she had formed with Shaznay. All Saints became a foursome, and their careers took off. After the success of the first album, Nicole found that suddenly she was \"a somebody\". She received a lot of \"positive attention\" when she and Robbie Williams got engaged. She loved it. \"Totally. The world was my best friend. I would say to the reporters, 'This is what Robbie and I are doing', and, 'We're going to move here.'\" But after they split up, she found that the tone of the stories changed, and became more and more lurid - there was always a list of men attached to her name. \"It all started going fucking AWOL for me. It was, like, everything I did ... I'm supposed to have this reputation. I'm considered this bad person and I'm so not.\" There have been a few stories that she says are just not true. The in-the-toilet-with-Leonardo-DiCaprio was one such: \"That was kind of embarrassing for my family, and so not my style, anyway. I would never, even in some private house with a guy I'm seeing - in the toilet! It just doesn't work like that.\" Some of the men she's been linked to (such as Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt), she claims never to have even met. Men don't get that, she says. Whereas figures such as Robbie Williams are congratulated in the press for their string of affairs (Williams encourages girlfriends to sell stories about his sexual prowess, she claims), it's a different story for women. The plastic surgery story (it was reported that she'd had a liposuction operation on her thighs) she says was also untrue: \"I did have a dream that I had a breast job, and I was surrounded by people and I was standing there going, 'Don't touch me, don't touch me!' It was a dream, though.\" There were other, more serious difficulties to contend with, as well - such as the stalker who harassed her for a month earlier this year. She reacted angrily, going out in the evenings by herself. \"It was really wrong of me to do that, and I got yelled at about it by my family, but it's just your natural reaction if someone's invading you.\" In the end, she and a male friend confronted the stalker, and it stopped. \"I just got really worried about my family, that's the only thing that can really get to me. Someone fucks with my family and that's it.\" She seems a robust kind of girl, but not quite as combative as she, in common with the rest of the band, has been characterised. How does she think they gained that reputation? \"Well, if we're gonna have a fight, we're gonna fight. We're not going to say, 'Let's go somewhere in private and have a fight.' We've had loads of fights.\" At one point it was reported that she was leaving the band. She wasn't getting on with their then manager, she says, she'd begun to feel like a \"robot\" and simply wanted a break. \"It's very difficult to be friends and have a business relationship.\" The differences they had were caused by the people around them. \"That's why we got rid of a lot of people at the beginning of the year. We changed our management, got rid of lawyers. It was just not working, it wasn't right. We were just not getting anywhere.\" It was she who initiated all of that, she says. \"There were a lot of blowouts because I felt like I was the only one trying to make a point.\" Of course, the situation may not have been helped by the fact that three of them went off for a prolonged period to make the film. How must Shaznay have felt? \"She was so supportive,\" says Nicole, \"but I don't know if that's how she felt ...\" Now all of these difficulties are behind her, and Nicole is thoroughly delighted with life. Her new boyfriend, Liam Gallagher of Oasis, is an \"absolute top gem\" and \"totally rooted\". She's certainly not fazed by his hell-raiser reputation; in fact, she's suspicious of \"squeaky-clean\" celebrities - the ones who are portrayed as the bad ones are generally the more honest, she says. \"If they want to tell someone to fuck off, then they will.\" She grins contentedly - she is smitten, and is not pretending otherwise. It sounds like love's young dream. With Robbie, she says, she sensed a certain, albeit unspoken, competitiveness in the relationship, but with Liam it's \"totally different\", and he is supportive of her music and career. And he's met her mother. He surprised her: she'd had a vision in her head of how he might be with her, \"like everyone else, thinking, 'Oh my God.' But they were sitting there - yak, yak, yak.\" Nicole does not get involved in Liam's troubles with Patsy Kensit, from whom he is now divorced: as far as she's concerned, it's none of her business. \"He doesn't come to me and tell me his problems. That's something he's had to deal with, and still has to deal with. I just want him to be happy and that's it.\" \"I've learnt my lesson,\" she says, puffing on a Silk Cut. \"I've been there, I've been everywhere, every club, had a great time, but it's time to calm down.\" Whether that ambition is altogether realistic remains to be seen, but she loves England, she loves the rain, the pubs, the food. If she were to buy another home, it would be in Ireland (her mother is Irish, she says). She's not ready to settle down and have babies, though. \"Work's too full-on at the moment, I just couldn't handle it. If I was pregnant now I'd probably, I don't know, just be really emotional and sick all over the place.\" Nicole's enthusiasm about Liam is touching. \"You'd love him! You'd think, Nic was right, he's great.\" She thinks the fact that they are both so busy will help keep the relationship exciting. She doesn't know if she's in love yet, but, \"It feels really right. That's what's scary. I don't want to get hurt, no one ever does, do they? But you know,\" she beams, \"I think if I can't do it, I don't know who can.\" Nicole's older sister, Natalie, who's 26, used to be an aerobics instructor - probably a very fierce and effective one. Her eyes brim with indignation. She was particularly unamused by the \"Why the world hates the Appleton sisters\" line: \"I thought, 'Holy shit, what is that all about?' The world hates us? Are we responsible for the war in Bosnia? Are we responsible for the Millennium Dome?\" She is famous for flying off the handle on a regular basis. Get her on certain topics, and she seethes with rage. \"They put Nic and me down, and say we're party animals. And women can be very catty about us. It's upsetting because I'm a woman's woman, and I'm against all that home-wrecking stuff. You don't fuck around with your friends' boyfriends. It happens a lot in this business, and everyone pretends to be goody-two-shoes, and Nic and I are the only ones who get any shit, and we're the ones who don't do stuff like that. I could just expose so many goody-two-shoes.\" Her mobile phone rings. It's Donna Air, the MTV presenter. \"She's moving in next door,\" she says, more calmly. \"She'll be coming round to borrow the sugar - or the vodka.\" She laughs. Natalie has a daughter, Rachel, who is eight years old. The father left the short-lived marriage one year after she was born, \"when I needed the help more than anything. I was on my own, no help, nothing.\" Being a single parent is \"the toughest thing in the world\". In the past year, the father has started seeing his daughter again, once a week or so. Natalie is \"kind of bitter\", and \"totally cynical\" about men (hardly any wonder, given the unedifying kiss-and-tell conduct of some of her exes). Still, that may have changed by now. A week or so after our chat, she started seeing Liam Howlett of the Prodigy (the Appleton sisters went on holiday this summer to the south of France, with both Liams in tow). She finds success sexy, she says, which may account both for Howlett and her past two long-term boyfriends - TV presenter Jamie Theakston (\"We're good friends now. He's an adult and he's smart. I get advice from him every now and then\") and actor Jonny Lee Miller. She approves of her sister's latest choice of man. \"He is such a big pussycat, and he's honest. He's spent a lot of time with my family. He's just a great, great person. He's always got a good thing to say. If people upset him, he'll have a go because he gets hurt. But, you know, everything we do musically, he's just, like, 'That's fuckin' great.' You can't condemn him if it doesn't work out, because he's still a young guy, and he got married at 22, and he needs to enjoy his life. Whatever happens between him and Nic, it doesn't matter. I'll always love him to death, and he'll always have us as friends.\" Does she want more children? \"I so want more. I want a home and family and husband. That's what I'm after now. The day I can afford to retire, I will, and I'll sing for fun. Even if All Saints don't exist, I'll still be Natalie Appleton, I'll still want to perform.\" Perhaps it's the Sylvia Young showbiz training. The Appleton sisters, like Mel, give the impression that All Saints is a job, not an all-consuming passion. If they hadn't done this, they would no doubt have found some other careers in the performing arts. With Shaznay, it's different: she never wanted to do anything else - for her, it is a compulsion. She, too, has a life outside All Saints, but you get the feeling that her love of music is something that she would have pursued regardless of success and the convertible parked outside. Just so long as Shaznay keeps those songs coming, All Saints should do fine. Without her songs, however - and, I'd guess, without her calming influence - they wouldn't exist. For a while it looked as if All Saints would implode, but not now. They may fall out, they may get drunk and lairy, but, if anything, it's their sulky, stroppy, bad-girl ways that is their appeal. It always has been. They probably know that - why else call the album Saints And Sinners? There's a what-you-see-is-what-you-get quality about them. They tell it like it is. It's tough being a single mother. Men can be crap. It's fun going out with Liam Gallagher. It's fun to drink vodka, or pints of lager. It's nice to be famous, up to a point. It's six o'clock, and the photoshoot is done. The girls are scooped up by their minder into a top-of-the-range people-carrier. Natalie and Nicole are off out for a drink with some starry friends at a newly opened bar. Mel's off home to south London. And Shaznay's working day has just begun - it's back to the recording studio for her, to put some final touches to the album \u0095 The album Saints And Sinners is released on October 16.",

      "body": "<p>Miles Davis wrote in his autobiography that jazz in the early 1980s was becoming \"the music of the museum\". Courtney Pine, the man who has done most in Britain to reverse that trend, was awarded the OBE in the 2000 new year's honours \"for services to jazz music\". But when, on tour in Russia, he was asked by a child why he got the OBE, he simply said: \"For playing the saxophone.\" </p> <p>The musician and composer Pine spearheaded Britain's jazz revival of the mid-1980s, becoming a catalyst and icon for the burgeoning first generation of black British jazz musicians, and a performer of world renown. But his response to the Russian child is revealing not only for his modest disavowal of role model status, but for the focused integrity of his approach to music. </p> <p>At the launch of his jazz career he was ubiquitous on TV and magazine covers as the 80s image of cool, in sharp suit and red beret, his saxophone a potent visual prop. But he made a level-headed vow to the music press: \"When you stop talking to me, I'll still be practising.\" His longevity in a notoriously fickle industry has borne this out. </p> <p>At 36, 14 years after he cut his first album, Pine is widely - if still sometimes grudgingly - acknowledged to be Britain's most popular and influential jazz artist; the nearest thing in British jazz to a household name. His debut recording in 1986, Journey To The Urge Within, was the first jazz album to enter the UK top 40 pop charts, and went on to sell more than 120,000 copies. His subsequent albums have sold steadily, averaging 60,000 copies each - not much for a pop star to sing about, but enviable in modern British jazz. </p> <p>He has broadened the music's appeal for a new generation, partly by a controversial fusion of acoustic jazz with other musical forms - from reggae, soul and afro-beat to hip-hop, drum 'n' bass and jungle - helping steer it to club audiences and dance floors. According to John Cumming, co-director of the London Jazz Festival, part of Pine's challenge is that \"he hasn't stood still. Throughout the history of jazz there's been resistance to new energy that might take the music in an unfamiliar direction; the reaction to bebop, to Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie in the 40s, was probably as severe as what Courtney's faced.\" </p> <p>He has shrewdly shared stages not only with such US jazz stars as the veteran pianist Ellis Marsalis, father of the jazz dynasty, and the diva Cassandra Wilson, but with rock and pop icons such as Mick Jagger and Elton John. His high-profile performances range from Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday concert at Wembley stadium in 1988 to the BBC1 Windrush gala concert which he directed in 1998 and the Archbishop of Canterbury's millennium show last year. </p> <p>Yet Pine speaks more about \"practice\" (eight hours a day) and \"research\" (he devours biographies) than exposure. \"If someone's a jazz musician, there's no hype; it's based on live experience,\" he says. A large and charismatic figure, who has swapped suit and tie for dreadlocks and Tommy Hilfiger casuals, he enjoys comparison with the US musician Wynton Marsalis, \"who's doing something a black man shouldn't be doing - being the best classical and jazz trumpeter in the world\". But he radiates a humble, clearly genuine missionary zeal. \"Jazz is creative music; it's the best music in the world. It can elevate people to a higher consciousness.\" </p> <p>His status owes much to this dedication and to sheer virtuosity. The Guardian's jazz critic, John Fordham, sees him as \"a phenomenal technician, drawing together styles from early jazz to experimental and avant-garde. His playing can be amazingly abstract, atonal, dissonant, but with such a strong underlying groove that it makes sense to a non-specialist audience. He's made the most advanced jazz of the last 30 years work with musical forms that are popular and accessible, even if he's not yet transformed the structure in the way of Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman or John Coltrane.\" </p> <p>Pine's 10th album, Back In The Day, is released on Monday, while his career is broadening out, not least as a DJ and presenter. Courtney Pine's Jazz Crusade is on Radio 2 on Monday evenings, following last year's six-part Jazz for the Millennium on the same station, and a BBC2 documentary on South Africa, Bands Apart, will be screened in October. He composed and performed the scores of two new British films: History is Made at Night, directed by Ilkka Jarvilaturi; and It Was An Accident, directed by Metin Huseyin, which opens on October 24, and for which Pine has been nominated \"best newcomer off screen\" in the British Independent Film Awards. Billed as a highlight of the London Jazz Festival in November, he will also be the subject of a South Bank Show that month. </p> <p>The new album was produced by Pine - whose instruments include soprano and tenor saxophone, bass clarinet, flutes and keyboard. He approached it \"like a DJ\", remixing himself, \"thinking about tempo and beats, not just scales and keys\". He calls it \"more of a personal statement\" than its predecessors, and it highlights soul influences from the 70s, with covers (destined for singles) of Gil Scott-Heron, Curtis Mayfield and Joan Armatrading sung by rising stars of UK rhythm and blues: Lynden David Hall, Beverley Knight and Kele Le Roc. </p> <p>The use of his live touring band, \"to make the album more British\", reflects a commitment to nurturing UK musicians that has marked his career. Many young musicians got their first breaks through his bands. Knight, who welcomes jazz as \"an antidote to a music industry obsessed with throwaway pop\", praises Pine's approach as \"unassuming: he gets behind you and gently pushes; he doesn't erect a soap box to stand on, or go about in a blaze of glory\". </p> <p>For the bassist Gary Crosby, Pine has been \"all-important in creating a more multiracial face to British jazz\", while the guitarist Cameron Pierre, a long-time friend and associate of Pine, believes \"young black musicians look up to him, and what he's achieved in a difficult climate, where black folks need to be twice as good to succeed\". Pine has spurred not only his contemporaries but also a rising generation of jazz artists, including saxophonists Denys Baptiste, Jason Yarde and Soweto Kinch, pianist Alex Wilson and singer Julie Dexter. </p> <p>\"He still gets crucified in certain quarters out of envy,\" Pierre adds, \"but they're eating good because of Courtney. Fifteen years ago, jazz in this country was dead and buried; it was an old, middle-class thing; a few middle-aged white men going down to Ronnie Scott's or the Flag and Firkin. Now more young people are going to jazz concerts than ever before - and that's down to Courtney Pine.\" </p> <p>Pine was born in London in 1964 and spent his early years in the numbered avenues off the Harrow Road, the northern fringes of the Notting Hill carnival. His parents, Keith, a carpenter, and Violet, a local authority housing manager, had arrived from Jamaica in the 1950s. His father played ska on a gramophone in the front room. \"I did all my playing on the avenues,\" says Pine. \"There was always music out of the African experience and the Caribbean - Dominican, Bajan, Jamaican, Trinidadian, Cuban. It was such a mixture of styles, you got energy from growing up in that.\" </p> <p>When Courtney was 14, the family moved to Kingsbury in north-west London, where he went to school with Frank Tontoh, now a session drummer, whose father ran the African rock band Osibisa. Pine recalls the late musician with residual awe: \"Mac Tontoh in a flashy red Lancer and leather pants: he was the black superstar; he was Shaft, and he played the trumpet. He'd play jazz records and take us to the studio. It's so important to listen to the elders, people who can tell you the short cuts. That's what Mac did for me. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be playing music.\" </p> <p>Pine took Grade 8 classical clarinet at school, taught himself the saxophone from the age of 14, but was drawn with his peers to soul, funk and reggae, and to the sound systems that were as much social nerve centres for mobilising black youth as entertainment. He moonlighted playing saxophone in reggae bands, \"living a musical life, then coming back on Monday to do school assembly as a prefect\". </p> <p>He began music A-Level, but was of a generation of black pupils failed by schools. \"There were two of us: a white violinist and me. I was an average student, but the teacher said I wasn't going to pass and that I should leave. I couldn't understand why that pathway to education shouldn't be open. The schoolteacher made my decision for me.\" He left, aged 16. </p> <p>When he became \"a horn man for hire\", his parents, \"deeply religious\" Methodists, were aghast. They thought it \"a joke, a flighty thing. Mum refused to believe I wouldn't go back into education; I was supposed to be a doctor. No-one else in the family played an instrument; music didn't fit into the plan.\" This spring, when he invited his parents to go with him to receive his OBE from the Queen, \"they said they were working. That generation of West Indians planned to come over for five years, but they're still paying off bills. They said 'well done'.\" </p> <p>Leaving home, he joined a reggae band \"for hire to the stars\". \"It's nice to be in a community of musicians. I love reggae music - the lyrics, the beats - working with Aswad, Rankin Dread, Al Campbell.\" In 1981 he toured Europe with the band Clint Eastwood &amp; General Saint, meeting Manu Dibango, to whose Afro-jazz he pays homage on his new album. Pine calls it \"a different education: being in a reggae band gave me a life experience\" - not least of the \"sus\" laws and police harassment that helped spark the urban uprisings of 1981. \"We were on our way to a gig and we wit nessed an accident. The police just started arresting black people and I ended up in a cell.\" </p> <p>He once admitted to having been \"out of control\" as a teenager. \"I had the reggae lifestyle - of drugs, drinking, groupies, being arrested - that travelling musicians will have to encounter and grow from. At 16 you want to know what the world tastes like; you just go for it.\" But while at school, Pine had been enthralled by the jazz saxophonist Grover Washington on TV, and picked out the Sonny Rollins record Way Out West in the library (\"It had the best cover\"). He was hooked. He played along to the instrumental B-sides of ska records by Jamaican jazz pioneers such as Roland Alphonso and Tommy McCook, then moved on to John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Louis Armstrong. </p> <p>His practising began in earnest. \"It's like calling up spirits; you learn different sounds then move on to someone else.\" Cameron Pierre, who toured with him in 1981 and is godfather to his daughter Isis, recalls the teenage Pine as \"fresh-faced and very English, the first serious musician I met: If you phoned between 8pm and 2am, you wouldn't find him. The guys in the band were upset; they said he practised too much. He was always destined to be a jazz man; he had the vision years ago.\" </p> <p>Another \"stabilising\" influence, says Pine, was his wife to be, June Guishard, now a senior child psychologist in Lambeth who has just completed a PhD. They met around sound systems when she was a student at Hull University. Married five years ago, they have been together since the early 80s, with a son of 14, Jemaal (who plays the double bass), and three daughters, ranging from seven to three. \"It's nice to have someone who's not a musician but can understand the madness. There's no competitiveness,\" he says. </p> <p>The couple formed the Abibi Jazz Arts Group to encourage young black talent at a time when, ironically, given the form's African-American roots, jazz was the preserve of white players. Pine later became a founder member of the Jazz Warriors, the now-famous big band that was a crucial training ground for talent and the African and Caribbean-inflected sound of black British jazz. </p> <p>Pine had found early enthusiasts in musicians such as saxophonist Steve Williamson and the flautist Philip Bent. \"We weren't college students; we played and loved jazz, but we weren't allowed to get up and jam in the clubs,\" he recalls. \"So we'd group together and practise in the toilet. White guys would come on stage with music - we read music, by the way - and play mellow and pretty. We'd get up on stage, knock the music down, and take over, then the owners would turn the lights off. Over a year, we shut down all the jam sessions.\" </p> <p>Unsung West Indian forerunners in Britain, such as the pioneers of European freeform jazz in the 1960s, Joe Harriott and Shake Keane, and the trumpeter Harry Beckett, were heroes of Pine - as was Ernest Ranglin who, he says, wasn't allowed on stage in Ronnie Scott's in 1964. \"Chris Blackwell had to insist, and he blew them away. Andy Hamilton was a great saxophonist from Jamaica who came to Birmingham in the 50s, but he made his first record in his 70s. I've learned you have to be in control; you have to understand the nature of capitalism. It's not just about a scale and a note; that you play saxophone and get acknowledged. There's a lot of knowledge required to gain longevity as a jazz musician.\" </p> <p>Pine answered an advertisement in the Voice newspaper to teach jazz at Community Music Ltd in Clerkenwell, a charity working with children and schizophrenic patients. Its director was the late John Stevens, \"a white free-jazz drummer who gave me a rare opportunity. I saw you could play jazz on stage with anyone, handicapped or otherwise, of any ability, as opposed to only working with the cream.\" </p> <p>While on a residency in south London, Pine was spotted for Island Records at the Atlantic pub in Coldharbour Lane. \"It was really dodgy, they were selling drugs, and guys would try and beat me up because I wasn't from Brixton. The owner had the idea that jazz could get rid of the evil element. I had six record offers out of that.\" </p> <p>Trevor Wyatt, then of Island Records (which signed Pine for \u00a31,000), recalls his \"extraordinary tone and spirit on the saxophone; it wasn't a rip off of American jazz - he had something unique\". Others even then saw a leader with a sense of destiny. Fordham recalls the teenage performer as \"still raw but with fantastic technique and confidence. He seemed to have a picture of himself as someone who would do things.\" </p> <p>His timing was inadvertently perfect, as he and other jazz musicians, including Andy Sheppard and Tommy Smith, became the soundtrack to the Thatcherite 80s. Fordham explains: \"With all that money in the economy, a new, young, champagne-and-red-braces class was looking for art forms that were emblems of quality but not dusty old high culture.\" </p> <p>But Pine's allure for a rising generation of black Britons looking for a challenge - he was likened by Fordham to the Pied Piper - outlived the 80s jazz vogue. \"The so-called jazz boom didn't really mean anything to me - the fashion, the image,\" Pine says. \"When I was at school, kids like me were buying \u00a320 Japanese records; we went to clubs to dance to jazz music. Then you got the Conservative government; jazz in a suit and tie. My approach to music just seemed to fit the template. But we were into something different.\" </p> <p>Yet the glamorous newcomers in the media spotlight put some noses out of joint. Pine remembers snide jokes about \"a black man wearing a suit and getting a record deal\". He says: \"The owner of one club in London said black musicians hadn't made a contribution to jazz in this country since the 50s. So I went down there and sorted a couple of people out - by playing.\" </p> <p>Some early detractors dismissed him as a Coltrane disciple. \"I thought it was a huge compliment: am I really that good? They didn't realise how powerful Coltrane was; he had a hard time in England in the 60s - a black man working with intelligence and harmonic knowledge. The Americans snapped me up.\" </p> <p>Pine became a session musician for touring US stars, such as Art Blakey and George Russell. His album Destiny's Song (1988), produced by Delfeayo Marsalis (the youngest of the clan), went into the US jazz charts. He then cut The Vision's Tale (1989) in New York, with Ellis Marsalis. Yet he turned down an invitation to join Blakey's Jazz Messengers, despite a glowing potential career in hard-core, bop-oriented US jazz. \"I've never really liked the tempo,\" he says of the country. \"It comes from being English and reserved - not into me, me, me. My American friends would say, 'Why don't you show more pizazz?'\" </p> <p>He also sees a hard choice facing jazz musicians: \"To stay in the practice room, the ivory tower, or go out to the rave. In America the vogue is to approach jazz like classical music; to give the perfect rendition of icons like Duke Ellington and Charlie Parker, as though you were approaching Bach or Shostakovich. Jazz says improvise, but it's limited: how would Thelonious Monk play it or Ella Fitzgerald sing it? I wasn't happy. I thought jazz was supposed to be about freedom.\" </p> <p>He looked for inspiration in his own own background. \"I'm not an American from New Orleans whose father is a musician carrying on the legacy. I had to keep it real. After I got to a certain point with my playing, I thought it should reflect my culture in a positive way - the Scratchlights, Bob Marley, Black Uhuru, sound systems, Shaka, blues parties, Linford Christie; who I am as a UK black.\" </p> <p>He had first gone to Jamaica with his mother, aged nine. \"I was petrified. I remember the stifling, porridge-like heat. I didn't drink the goat's milk.\" But he returned at 21, on holiday with his wife and son. \"It was very liberating to see black people in power. You like yourself more.\" Pine cut his \"first reggae album\", Closer To Home (1990), in Jamaica with the reggae producer Gussie Clarke. \"A lot of critics couldn't hear the reggae bass lines before. After that album, they stopped asking.\" </p> <p>Then events altered his course. His six children were all born prematurely; only four survived. Two-day-old Shana died in his arms, but he was in the US when his first daughter, Cleopatra, died in 1991. \"I was on tour with some obnoxious, hostile American musicians. I became a father, and was elated, then two days later, I wasn't. Cleopatra opened up my mind to things I take for granted, made me see more clearly. </p> <p>\"People who are jealous of a little success, I don't have time for them. There's more to life.\" It was also a time of financial crisis, after losing a legal suit over management and owing \u00a350,000. \"I was 11.59 to bankruptcy, and I was managing myself. I thought I can't just be playing standards in the American jazz tradition. It liberated me to incorporate more of who I am, starting with Africa.\" To The Eyes Of Creation (1992) [which Pine produced and dedicated to Cleopatra], integrated African, Caribbean and Indian influences - he had begun to work with the British Asian fusion artist Talvin Singh. </p> <p>\"This record shouldn't have happened yet. But because of Cleopatra, I felt, 'do it now - I don't know how long life is'. She made me get to that place earlier.\" He said he wanted people to \"hear what it means to be an African West Indian European\". </p> <p>Pine's dreadlocks (\"I've gone through many hairstyles\") are not an emblem of Rastafarianism. \"In terms of supporting one religion, I'm researching.\" But his album made explicit a more diffuse spiritual side to his music. \"I've been able to connect to religious rhythms - Yoruba, Shango - that take you back to Egypt, one of the great civilisations of Africa. The music isn't just about a catchphrase of a solo, but something deeper. It comes straight from the Creator. For me, it's a religious experience.\" </p> <p>The rapper Guru's Jazzmatazz album, on which Pine collaborated in 1993, was another turning point, that led to his albums Modern Day Jazz Stories (1996) and Underground (1997). He brought in DJ Pogo on turntables, Sparkii and the rapper MC Mello, using electronic dance music, sampling and scratching. The two albums were remixed on Another Story by Roni Size and other drum 'n' bass artists. Nathan Graves, UK head of jazz for the Universal music group, the US company to which Pine is now signed, says he \"has an extraordinary ear; he's jazz-oriented but his music reflects his taste in not just reggae and rhythm and blues, but hip-hop and drum 'n' bass.\" </p> <p>\"Jazz has always been about fusion,\" says Pine. \"In housing estates you hear reggae, techno, classical; you walk through a flat and hear a random mix. But it becomes harmonious, like mixing cultures to get something different, shocking and stimulating. I'd get home from a jazz gig and play ska, or early 4 Hero, or Goldie. So I made a conscious effort to fuse the two, to inspire myself again.\" </p> <p>The fusion made Modern Day Jazz Stories one of the Mercury music prize albums of the year in 1996, and won Pine a MOBO (music of black origin) for best jazz act two years running. The single of Cassandra Wilson's cover of I've Known Rivers was in the UK charts, and her Don't Explain was on the Kiss FM playlist for 10 weeks. But jazz purists were \"stumped\", he says. \"Guys are the self-proclaimed experts. Women in this country have no need to know the ins and outs of the mechanics; they just like the music, it moves them. But men get all anal about it and try to impress their friends.\" </p> <p>For Adrian Gibson, who runs London's Jazz Cafe in Camden, Pine is \"the only one in England to have made the straight-ahead jazz scene in London sit up to other musics. He went through what Miles Davis did in the 70s, but perceptions have changed. Now people accept you can have a reggae track in the middle of jazz. He's built respect from his audiences by respecting them: he'll bring you into his music, not throw in something that's way too heavy, or bore you with a 25-minute solo.\" </p> <p>With the evolution of Pine's music has come a more relaxed style. \"I used to say, this is the best music in the world, and, being a youngster, I thought wearing a smart suit would say that,\" he smiles. \"But with a hip-hop band, the audience is ready to take part, dressing the way I dress every day. I decided to bring that to jazz.\" </p> <p>Claiming to have spent all his money on \"studio tech\" in his detached house in Harrow, north-west London, Pine is chuffed to be asked how he composes. He writes music, often at the piano, to a title - whether on Stephen Lawrence or Shaka Zulu - \"as though it were prose; then I do edits and improvisation, and put in a reggae bass line. So the composition is a mixture of elements as well as upholding or breaking the rules of the jazz tradition.\" </p> <p>As a youthful elder statesman of British jazz, Pine sees a changing climate for black, college-educated jazz musicians, with more of them \"in positions of power, owning their own bands and radio stations\". Yet he warns of the limits of that change and of a leakage to the US, citing Julie Dexter and Ronny Jordan. \"They're leaving one by one; this generation won't stand for playing pubs for door money.\" His ambition is to set up his own record label, \"but for us, survival is so important. I've clawed my way back from near-bankruptcy; I survive on gigs.\" A fan of computer games for relaxation, he praises the internet as \"another medium to get music out\". </p> <p>He leads by example. \"Sometimes a person's presence is the only influence necessary,\" says the poet Lemn Sissay, who has recorded a new album, Words And Pictures, with the Apollo Sax Quartet. \"Courtney's showed you can be black and British and experimental and successful; you don't have to succumb to American pop, though I'm sure the industry will only allow in a trickle like that.\" </p> <p>An informal \"patron\" to Tomorrow's Warriors, a spinoff from the Jazz Warriors, Pine is also to do workshops with schoolchildren from Hackney, Lambeth and Southwark under the auspices of the London Jazz Festival in November, in line with his British Council-sponsored masterclasses wherever he tours in the world. \"I've been given knowledge by others, and you have to pass it on,\" he reflects. \"If someone's inspired, all well and good. But I don't sit down and do a Malcolm X about being an example; I'm still too much in the gig - and it's hardly even started.\" </p> <p>Back in the Day is out on Blue Thumb on Monday.

      "bodyText": "Miles Davis wrote in his autobiography that jazz in the early 1980s was becoming \"the music of the museum\". Courtney Pine, the man who has done most in Britain to reverse that trend, was awarded the OBE in the 2000 new year's honours \"for services to jazz music\". But when, on tour in Russia, he was asked by a child why he got the OBE, he simply said: \"For playing the saxophone.\" The musician and composer Pine spearheaded Britain's jazz revival of the mid-1980s, becoming a catalyst and icon for the burgeoning first generation of black British jazz musicians, and a performer of world renown. But his response to the Russian child is revealing not only for his modest disavowal of role model status, but for the focused integrity of his approach to music. At the launch of his jazz career he was ubiquitous on TV and magazine covers as the 80s image of cool, in sharp suit and red beret, his saxophone a potent visual prop. But he made a level-headed vow to the music press: \"When you stop talking to me, I'll still be practising.\" His longevity in a notoriously fickle industry has borne this out. At 36, 14 years after he cut his first album, Pine is widely - if still sometimes grudgingly - acknowledged to be Britain's most popular and influential jazz artist; the nearest thing in British jazz to a household name. His debut recording in 1986, Journey To The Urge Within, was the first jazz album to enter the UK top 40 pop charts, and went on to sell more than 120,000 copies. His subsequent albums have sold steadily, averaging 60,000 copies each - not much for a pop star to sing about, but enviable in modern British jazz. He has broadened the music's appeal for a new generation, partly by a controversial fusion of acoustic jazz with other musical forms - from reggae, soul and afro-beat to hip-hop, drum 'n' bass and jungle - helping steer it to club audiences and dance floors. According to John Cumming, co-director of the London Jazz Festival, part of Pine's challenge is that \"he hasn't stood still. Throughout the history of jazz there's been resistance to new energy that might take the music in an unfamiliar direction; the reaction to bebop, to Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie in the 40s, was probably as severe as what Courtney's faced.\" He has shrewdly shared stages not only with such US jazz stars as the veteran pianist Ellis Marsalis, father of the jazz dynasty, and the diva Cassandra Wilson, but with rock and pop icons such as Mick Jagger and Elton John. His high-profile performances range from Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday concert at Wembley stadium in 1988 to the BBC1 Windrush gala concert which he directed in 1998 and the Archbishop of Canterbury's millennium show last year. Yet Pine speaks more about \"practice\" (eight hours a day) and \"research\" (he devours biographies) than exposure. \"If someone's a jazz musician, there's no hype; it's based on live experience,\" he says. A large and charismatic figure, who has swapped suit and tie for dreadlocks and Tommy Hilfiger casuals, he enjoys comparison with the US musician Wynton Marsalis, \"who's doing something a black man shouldn't be doing - being the best classical and jazz trumpeter in the world\". But he radiates a humble, clearly genuine missionary zeal. \"Jazz is creative music; it's the best music in the world. It can elevate people to a higher consciousness.\" His status owes much to this dedication and to sheer virtuosity. The Guardian's jazz critic, John Fordham, sees him as \"a phenomenal technician, drawing together styles from early jazz to experimental and avant-garde. His playing can be amazingly abstract, atonal, dissonant, but with such a strong underlying groove that it makes sense to a non-specialist audience. He's made the most advanced jazz of the last 30 years work with musical forms that are popular and accessible, even if he's not yet transformed the structure in the way of Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman or John Coltrane.\" Pine's 10th album, Back In The Day, is released on Monday, while his career is broadening out, not least as a DJ and presenter. Courtney Pine's Jazz Crusade is on Radio 2 on Monday evenings, following last year's six-part Jazz for the Millennium on the same station, and a BBC2 documentary on South Africa, Bands Apart, will be screened in October. He composed and performed the scores of two new British films: History is Made at Night, directed by Ilkka Jarvilaturi; and It Was An Accident, directed by Metin Huseyin, which opens on October 24, and for which Pine has been nominated \"best newcomer off screen\" in the British Independent Film Awards. Billed as a highlight of the London Jazz Festival in November, he will also be the subject of a South Bank Show that month. The new album was produced by Pine - whose instruments include soprano and tenor saxophone, bass clarinet, flutes and keyboard. He approached it \"like a DJ\", remixing himself, \"thinking about tempo and beats, not just scales and keys\". He calls it \"more of a personal statement\" than its predecessors, and it highlights soul influences from the 70s, with covers (destined for singles) of Gil Scott-Heron, Curtis Mayfield and Joan Armatrading sung by rising stars of UK rhythm and blues: Lynden David Hall, Beverley Knight and Kele Le Roc. The use of his live touring band, \"to make the album more British\", reflects a commitment to nurturing UK musicians that has marked his career. Many young musicians got their first breaks through his bands. Knight, who welcomes jazz as \"an antidote to a music industry obsessed with throwaway pop\", praises Pine's approach as \"unassuming: he gets behind you and gently pushes; he doesn't erect a soap box to stand on, or go about in a blaze of glory\". For the bassist Gary Crosby, Pine has been \"all-important in creating a more multiracial face to British jazz\", while the guitarist Cameron Pierre, a long-time friend and associate of Pine, believes \"young black musicians look up to him, and what he's achieved in a difficult climate, where black folks need to be twice as good to succeed\". Pine has spurred not only his contemporaries but also a rising generation of jazz artists, including saxophonists Denys Baptiste, Jason Yarde and Soweto Kinch, pianist Alex Wilson and singer Julie Dexter. \"He still gets crucified in certain quarters out of envy,\" Pierre adds, \"but they're eating good because of Courtney. Fifteen years ago, jazz in this country was dead and buried; it was an old, middle-class thing; a few middle-aged white men going down to Ronnie Scott's or the Flag and Firkin. Now more young people are going to jazz concerts than ever before - and that's down to Courtney Pine.\" Pine was born in London in 1964 and spent his early years in the numbered avenues off the Harrow Road, the northern fringes of the Notting Hill carnival. His parents, Keith, a carpenter, and Violet, a local authority housing manager, had arrived from Jamaica in the 1950s. His father played ska on a gramophone in the front room. \"I did all my playing on the avenues,\" says Pine. \"There was always music out of the African experience and the Caribbean - Dominican, Bajan, Jamaican, Trinidadian, Cuban. It was such a mixture of styles, you got energy from growing up in that.\" When Courtney was 14, the family moved to Kingsbury in north-west London, where he went to school with Frank Tontoh, now a session drummer, whose father ran the African rock band Osibisa. Pine recalls the late musician with residual awe: \"Mac Tontoh in a flashy red Lancer and leather pants: he was the black superstar; he was Shaft, and he played the trumpet. He'd play jazz records and take us to the studio. It's so important to listen to the elders, people who can tell you the short cuts. That's what Mac did for me. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be playing music.\" Pine took Grade 8 classical clarinet at school, taught himself the saxophone from the age of 14, but was drawn with his peers to soul, funk and reggae, and to the sound systems that were as much social nerve centres for mobilising black youth as entertainment. He moonlighted playing saxophone in reggae bands, \"living a musical life, then coming back on Monday to do school assembly as a prefect\". He began music A-Level, but was of a generation of black pupils failed by schools. \"There were two of us: a white violinist and me. I was an average student, but the teacher said I wasn't going to pass and that I should leave. I couldn't understand why that pathway to education shouldn't be open. The schoolteacher made my decision for me.\" He left, aged 16. When he became \"a horn man for hire\", his parents, \"deeply religious\" Methodists, were aghast. They thought it \"a joke, a flighty thing. Mum refused to believe I wouldn't go back into education; I was supposed to be a doctor. No-one else in the family played an instrument; music didn't fit into the plan.\" This spring, when he invited his parents to go with him to receive his OBE from the Queen, \"they said they were working. That generation of West Indians planned to come over for five years, but they're still paying off bills. They said 'well done'.\" Leaving home, he joined a reggae band \"for hire to the stars\". \"It's nice to be in a community of musicians. I love reggae music - the lyrics, the beats - working with Aswad, Rankin Dread, Al Campbell.\" In 1981 he toured Europe with the band Clint Eastwood &amp; General Saint, meeting Manu Dibango, to whose Afro-jazz he pays homage on his new album. Pine calls it \"a different education: being in a reggae band gave me a life experience\" - not least of the \"sus\" laws and police harassment that helped spark the urban uprisings of 1981. \"We were on our way to a gig and we wit nessed an accident. The police just started arresting black people and I ended up in a cell.\" He once admitted to having been \"out of control\" as a teenager. \"I had the reggae lifestyle - of drugs, drinking, groupies, being arrested - that travelling musicians will have to encounter and grow from. At 16 you want to know what the world tastes like; you just go for it.\" But while at school, Pine had been enthralled by the jazz saxophonist Grover Washington on TV, and picked out the Sonny Rollins record Way Out West in the library (\"It had the best cover\"). He was hooked. He played along to the instrumental B-sides of ska records by Jamaican jazz pioneers such as Roland Alphonso and Tommy McCook, then moved on to John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Louis Armstrong. His practising began in earnest. \"It's like calling up spirits; you learn different sounds then move on to someone else.\" Cameron Pierre, who toured with him in 1981 and is godfather to his daughter Isis, recalls the teenage Pine as \"fresh-faced and very English, the first serious musician I met: If you phoned between 8pm and 2am, you wouldn't find him. The guys in the band were upset; they said he practised too much. He was always destined to be a jazz man; he had the vision years ago.\" Another \"stabilising\" influence, says Pine, was his wife to be, June Guishard, now a senior child psychologist in Lambeth who has just completed a PhD. They met around sound systems when she was a student at Hull University. Married five years ago, they have been together since the early 80s, with a son of 14, Jemaal (who plays the double bass), and three daughters, ranging from seven to three. \"It's nice to have someone who's not a musician but can understand the madness. There's no competitiveness,\" he says. The couple formed the Abibi Jazz Arts Group to encourage young black talent at a time when, ironically, given the form's African-American roots, jazz was the preserve of white players. Pine later became a founder member of the Jazz Warriors, the now-famous big band that was a crucial training ground for talent and the African and Caribbean-inflected sound of black British jazz. Pine had found early enthusiasts in musicians such as saxophonist Steve Williamson and the flautist Philip Bent. \"We weren't college students; we played and loved jazz, but we weren't allowed to get up and jam in the clubs,\" he recalls. \"So we'd group together and practise in the toilet. White guys would come on stage with music - we read music, by the way - and play mellow and pretty. We'd get up on stage, knock the music down, and take over, then the owners would turn the lights off. Over a year, we shut down all the jam sessions.\" Unsung West Indian forerunners in Britain, such as the pioneers of European freeform jazz in the 1960s, Joe Harriott and Shake Keane, and the trumpeter Harry Beckett, were heroes of Pine - as was Ernest Ranglin who, he says, wasn't allowed on stage in Ronnie Scott's in 1964. \"Chris Blackwell had to insist, and he blew them away. Andy Hamilton was a great saxophonist from Jamaica who came to Birmingham in the 50s, but he made his first record in his 70s. I've learned you have to be in control; you have to understand the nature of capitalism. It's not just about a scale and a note; that you play saxophone and get acknowledged. There's a lot of knowledge required to gain longevity as a jazz musician.\" Pine answered an advertisement in the Voice newspaper to teach jazz at Community Music Ltd in Clerkenwell, a charity working with children and schizophrenic patients. Its director was the late John Stevens, \"a white free-jazz drummer who gave me a rare opportunity. I saw you could play jazz on stage with anyone, handicapped or otherwise, of any ability, as opposed to only working with the cream.\" While on a residency in south London, Pine was spotted for Island Records at the Atlantic pub in Coldharbour Lane. \"It was really dodgy, they were selling drugs, and guys would try and beat me up because I wasn't from Brixton. The owner had the idea that jazz could get rid of the evil element. I had six record offers out of that.\" Trevor Wyatt, then of Island Records (which signed Pine for \u00a31,000), recalls his \"extraordinary tone and spirit on the saxophone; it wasn't a rip off of American jazz - he had something unique\". Others even then saw a leader with a sense of destiny. Fordham recalls the teenage performer as \"still raw but with fantastic technique and confidence. He seemed to have a picture of himself as someone who would do things.\" His timing was inadvertently perfect, as he and other jazz musicians, including Andy Sheppard and Tommy Smith, became the soundtrack to the Thatcherite 80s. Fordham explains: \"With all that money in the economy, a new, young, champagne-and-red-braces class was looking for art forms that were emblems of quality but not dusty old high culture.\" But Pine's allure for a rising generation of black Britons looking for a challenge - he was likened by Fordham to the Pied Piper - outlived the 80s jazz vogue. \"The so-called jazz boom didn't really mean anything to me - the fashion, the image,\" Pine says. \"When I was at school, kids like me were buying \u00a320 Japanese records; we went to clubs to dance to jazz music. Then you got the Conservative government; jazz in a suit and tie. My approach to music just seemed to fit the template. But we were into something different.\" Yet the glamorous newcomers in the media spotlight put some noses out of joint. Pine remembers snide jokes about \"a black man wearing a suit and getting a record deal\". He says: \"The owner of one club in London said black musicians hadn't made a contribution to jazz in this country since the 50s. So I went down there and sorted a couple of people out - by playing.\" Some early detractors dismissed him as a Coltrane disciple. \"I thought it was a huge compliment: am I really that good? They didn't realise how powerful Coltrane was; he had a hard time in England in the 60s - a black man working with intelligence and harmonic knowledge. The Americans snapped me up.\" Pine became a session musician for touring US stars, such as Art Blakey and George Russell. His album Destiny's Song (1988), produced by Delfeayo Marsalis (the youngest of the clan), went into the US jazz charts. He then cut The Vision's Tale (1989) in New York, with Ellis Marsalis. Yet he turned down an invitation to join Blakey's Jazz Messengers, despite a glowing potential career in hard-core, bop-oriented US jazz. \"I've never really liked the tempo,\" he says of the country. \"It comes from being English and reserved - not into me, me, me. My American friends would say, 'Why don't you show more pizazz?'\" He also sees a hard choice facing jazz musicians: \"To stay in the practice room, the ivory tower, or go out to the rave. In America the vogue is to approach jazz like classical music; to give the perfect rendition of icons like Duke Ellington and Charlie Parker, as though you were approaching Bach or Shostakovich.

I thought jazz was supposed to be about freedom.\" He looked for inspiration in his own own background. \"I'm not an American from New Orleans whose father is a musician carrying on the legacy. I had to keep it real. After I got to a certain point with my playing, I thought it should reflect my culture in a positive way - the Scratchlights, Bob Marley, Black Uhuru, sound systems, Shaka, blues parties, Linford Christie; who I am as a UK black.\" He had first gone to Jamaica with his mother, aged nine. \"I was petrified. I remember the stifling, porridge-like heat. I didn't drink the goat's milk.\" But he returned at 21, on holiday with his wife and son. \"It was very liberating to see black people in power. You like yourself more.\" Pine cut his \"first reggae album\", Closer To Home (1990), in Jamaica with the reggae producer Gussie Clarke. \"A lot of critics couldn't hear the reggae bass lines before. After that album, they stopped asking.\" Then events altered his course. His six children were all born prematurely; only four survived. Two-day-old Shana died in his arms, but he was in the US when his first daughter, Cleopatra, died in 1991. \"I was on tour with some obnoxious, hostile American musicians. I became a father, and was elated, then two days later, I wasn't. Cleopatra opened up my mind to things I take for granted, made me see more clearly. \"People who are jealous of a little success, I don't have time for them. There's more to life.\" It was also a time of financial crisis, after losing a legal suit over management and owing \u00a350,000. \"I was 11.59 to bankruptcy, and I was managing myself. I thought I can't just be playing standards in the American jazz tradition. It liberated me to incorporate more of who I am, starting with Africa.\" To The Eyes Of Creation (1992) [which Pine produced and dedicated to Cleopatra], integrated African, Caribbean and Indian influences - he had begun to work with the British Asian fusion artist Talvin Singh. \"This record shouldn't have happened yet. But because of Cleopatra, I felt, 'do it now - I don't know how long life is'. She made me get to that place earlier.\" He said he wanted people to \"hear what it means to be an African West Indian European\". Pine's dreadlocks (\"I've gone through many hairstyles\") are not an emblem of Rastafarianism. \"In terms of supporting one religion, I'm researching.\" But his album made explicit a more diffuse spiritual side to his music. \"I've been able to connect to religious rhythms - Yoruba, Shango - that take you back to Egypt, one of the great civilisations of Africa. The music isn't just about a catchphrase of a solo, but something deeper. It comes straight from the Creator. For me, it's a religious experience.\" The rapper Guru's Jazzmatazz album, on which Pine collaborated in 1993, was another turning point, that led to his albums Modern Day Jazz Stories (1996) and Underground (1997). He brought in DJ Pogo on turntables, Sparkii and the rapper MC Mello, using electronic dance music, sampling and scratching. The two albums were remixed on Another Story by Roni Size and other drum 'n' bass artists. Nathan Graves, UK head of jazz for the Universal music group, the US company to which Pine is now signed, says he \"has an extraordinary ear; he's jazz-oriented but his music reflects his taste in not just reggae and rhythm and blues, but hip-hop and drum 'n' bass.\" \"Jazz has always been about fusion,\" says Pine. \"In housing estates you hear reggae, techno, classical; you walk through a flat and hear a random mix. But it becomes harmonious, like mixing cultures to get something different, shocking and stimulating. I'd get home from a jazz gig and play ska, or early 4 Hero, or Goldie. So I made a conscious effort to fuse the two, to inspire myself again.\" The fusion made Modern Day Jazz Stories one of the Mercury music prize albums of the year in 1996, and won Pine a MOBO (music of black origin) for best jazz act two years running. The single of Cassandra Wilson's cover of I've Known Rivers was in the UK charts, and her Don't Explain was on the Kiss FM playlist for 10 weeks. But jazz purists were \"stumped\", he says. \"Guys are the self-proclaimed experts. Women in this country have no need to know the ins and outs of the mechanics; they just like the music, it moves them. But men get all anal about it and try to impress their friends.\" For Adrian Gibson, who runs London's Jazz Cafe in Camden, Pine is \"the only one in England to have made the straight-ahead jazz scene in London sit up to other musics. He went through what Miles Davis did in the 70s, but perceptions have changed. Now people accept you can have a reggae track in the middle of jazz. He's built respect from his audiences by respecting them: he'll bring you into his music, not throw in something that's way too heavy, or bore you with a 25-minute solo.\" With the evolution of Pine's music has come a more relaxed style. \"I used to say, this is the best music in the world, and, being a youngster, I thought wearing a smart suit would say that,\" he smiles. \"But with a hip-hop band, the audience is ready to take part, dressing the way I dress every day. I decided to bring that to jazz.\" Claiming to have spent all his money on \"studio tech\" in his detached house in Harrow, north-west London, Pine is chuffed to be asked how he composes. He writes music, often at the piano, to a title - whether on Stephen Lawrence or Shaka Zulu - \"as though it were prose; then I do edits and improvisation, and put in a reggae bass line. So the composition is a mixture of elements as well as upholding or breaking the rules of the jazz tradition.\" As a youthful elder statesman of British jazz, Pine sees a changing climate for black, college-educated jazz musicians, with more of them \"in positions of power, owning their own bands and radio stations\". Yet he warns of the limits of that change and of a leakage to the US, citing Julie Dexter and Ronny Jordan. \"They're leaving one by one; this generation won't stand for playing pubs for door money.\" His ambition is to set up his own record label, \"but for us, survival is so important. I've clawed my way back from near-bankruptcy; I survive on gigs.\" A fan of computer games for relaxation, he praises the internet as \"another medium to get music out\". He leads by example. \"Sometimes a person's presence is the only influence necessary,\" says the poet Lemn Sissay, who has recorded a new album, Words And Pictures, with the Apollo Sax Quartet. \"Courtney's showed you can be black and British and experimental and successful; you don't have to succumb to American pop, though I'm sure the industry will only allow in a trickle like that.\" An informal \"patron\" to Tomorrow's Warriors, a spinoff from the Jazz Warriors, Pine is also to do workshops with schoolchildren from Hackney, Lambeth and Southwark under the auspices of the London Jazz Festival in November, in line with his British Council-sponsored masterclasses wherever he tours in the world. \"I've been given knowledge by others, and you have to pass it on,\" he reflects. \"If someone's inspired, all well and good. But I don't sit down and do a Malcolm X about being an example; I'm still too much in the gig - and it's hardly even started.\" Back in the Day is out on Blue Thumb on Monday. Bands Apart will be on BBC2 on Thursday October 19 at 11.30pm. Courtney Pine tours the UK through October and plays London's Royal Festival Hall on Friday November 17.
